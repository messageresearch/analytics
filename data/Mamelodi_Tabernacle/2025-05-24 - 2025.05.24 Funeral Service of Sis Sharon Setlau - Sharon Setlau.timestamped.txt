[33:19] He never
[33:25] grow.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Shalom. Um, just a little correction. I
[33:37] go by the name of
[33:41] &gt;&gt; the queen.
[33:43] Um, where do I even begin?
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Um, I first met SHZ in 2015
[33:56] &gt;&gt; when I joined the visa SOS team.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; SOS.
[34:03] She was just another female colleague.
[34:08] Little did I know as the months go by
[34:15] we would be very close friends.
[34:20] I cannot really pinpoint
[34:22] when we became friends,
[34:27] &gt;&gt; but I must think it had to do with the
[34:32] character trait that she had.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; She had this character trait of asking
[34:43] the weirdest questions.
[34:47] Those
[34:49] questions that one in the world would
[34:54] say
[34:58] one in the world will says kind of
[35:01] witchcraft questions.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Where do you come from?
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Where do you stay?
[35:10] &gt;&gt; What did you used to come here?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Which route are you using? But no, it
[35:16] wasn't that.
[35:18] It's because she cared.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; And because of that beautiful smile,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; guess what I did?
[35:31] I answered all those questions.
[35:35] All of them. And every day she would
[35:38] check up on the previous questions
[35:41] answer.
[35:46] If I told her
[35:50] that's why I'm 5 minutes late
[35:53] &gt;&gt; today I'm 5 minutes late because the
[35:55] route I'm using had traffic.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; The next day she would asked did you use
[35:59] a different route?
[36:03] &gt;&gt; So you understand when I'm saying she
[36:05] asked because she cared.
[36:13] She was a character of note
[36:18] [Music]
[36:19] &gt;&gt; at times.
[36:22] I thought perhaps she just wants to show
[36:25] off,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; especially when it came to this other
[36:32] character trait
[36:37] because I would wake up 4:00 in the
[36:40] morning,
[36:43] get ready for work
[36:46] and make sure that I'm at work 7
[36:51] by 7, which
[36:53] And then he'll be asking
[36:56] &gt;&gt; and then I'm saying you ask
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Sharon wake up at 6
[37:04] &gt;&gt; and she'll come to work.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; She would look like she's the one who
[37:08] woke up and then
[37:12] she had this character of
[37:14] procrastinating.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; It's like she had all the time in the
[37:21] world.
[37:24] And I always thought, how do you do it?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; This one time
[37:35] this character and then I realized this
[37:37] character can't handle it is when I had
[37:40] to drive
[37:42] in the same car with her.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; She was the driver.
[37:49] You'll understand why she was the
[37:51] driver.
[37:55] Michael Schumacher has got nothing on
[37:57] her
[38:01] on our way cuz we were rushing somewhere
[38:03] as
[38:07] &gt;&gt; we stopped by chicken licking.
[38:10] H
[38:11] &gt;&gt; it's not a paid sponsor by the way.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Uh we grabbed a few wings.
[38:18] Our tradition was that we add extra hot
[38:21] sauce
[38:23] [Music]
[38:26] that day.
[38:29] Remember she's driving.
[38:32] I couldn't even eat more than two.
[38:38] I felt them so hot.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; When we were at the robot, she asked
[38:46] cuz that's what she used to call me.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; That's how she called her.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Why aren't you eating?
[38:53] &gt;&gt; I said, "These things are too hot."
[38:57] &gt;&gt; When we arrived where we were going,
[38:58] &gt;&gt; she said, "Let me have some of those
[39:00] wings."
[39:04] She ate the first one.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, give me some more hot
[39:09] sauce."
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Said, "These things are not hot."
[39:13] &gt;&gt; It's because you were not driving.
[39:17] Have you seen your self drive?
[39:20] &gt;&gt; But nonetheless,
[39:23] she always made sure we were okay. She
[39:26] always made sure we were okay.
[39:30] One thing I know we all going to take
[39:33] from her life,
[39:37] she was never too busy
[39:42] for to ask the questions.
[39:46] the questions that would make you feel
[39:50] or she cares about you.
[39:55] She says would be busy swamped with work
[39:57] in the office.
[40:02] But when you pass by her office,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; she won't allow you just to pass by.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; She would say
[40:12] my person
[40:13] &gt;&gt; baby.
[40:19] Yes,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; she had a name for everyone.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; She would make sure that you acknowledge
[40:31] because she wanted to check on you.
[40:35] She always had time to sneak in her
[40:38] tight hug
[40:43] and give us a kiss on the cheek
[40:48] and she would continue to encourage you
[40:52] no matter what we move.
[40:57] So if I had all the time,
[41:02] there would still be so many stories
[41:04] that I can unfold to tell you about this
[41:07] amazing
[41:11] about this amazing woman.
[41:14] But because of time,
[41:20] I will just stop here. But before we go,
[41:23] I would like to say these words.
[41:30] Blessing.

[44:36] Amen.
[44:46] We are coming to say to the family,

[44:58] We remember Sharon because of her works
[45:02] in the big office,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; the office that works with finances at
[45:08] school.
[45:15] Sharon made sure that when she's doing
[45:16] her work, she'll do it slowly but
[45:18] surely.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's Sharon.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; When she called me, she'll say, "My big
[45:25] sister."
[45:27] &gt;&gt; And then I'll say, "My younger sister."
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You must go well. We worked well with
[45:35] you. Up and downs even though we had up

[45:59] and then the words of the speaker.
[46:04] He says there's a time to sow
[46:08] and then there's a time to reap.
[46:11] There's a time to be born
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and there's a time to depart
[46:18] and now this is the time that arrive
[46:22] with those words as a family.

[48:17] Um,
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I'll speak about Sheron a bit.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; I will say we grew up together.
[48:28] We were very close.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; After hearing that, she departed
[48:40] because I know
[48:43] I was heard because I knew she didn't
[48:45] get sick.
[48:48] Because being the will of God,
[48:52] there's nothing much we can do. We
[48:53] should just accept
[48:56] God knows much above us.
[49:00] We are thankful

[50:25] before me that I hear from the people
[50:27] who spoke before me,
[50:30] they spoke well about her
[50:32] &gt;&gt; especially because I didn't know that
[50:34] side of her.
[50:40] So we are thankful for you to letting us
[50:42] know how what kind of a person she was
[50:47] including by that to thank you.

[56:14] [Music]
[56:23] [Music]
[56:30] would like to greet everyone in the name
[56:31] of Jesus. Jesus Christ.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; It is difficult to stand here.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; But we thank God because of the life of
[56:48] sister Sheron.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; She was really a loving person.
[56:54] When I came to family,
[56:56] &gt;&gt; like the other sisters,
[56:59] we were never treated like
[57:01] [Music]
[57:04] She was our sister.
[57:06] She was our big sister.
[57:13] She was our pillar.
[57:16] Everything that happens in the family.
[57:20] She's the one who led us. We always
[57:22] followed her instructions.
[57:26] So preparing for this funeral was a bit
[57:28] hectic.
[57:32] because she was not there
[57:36] but
[57:37] everything but we thank God.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. She celebrated all the milestones.
[57:48] Especially birthdays
[57:51] not only for herself but because
[57:54] she bought us gifts
[57:57] always even a message.
[57:59] in the morning she will be
[58:03] even when other people will forget
[58:05] she'll be there
[58:08] to send a message to say hey everybody
[58:09] in the family
[58:14] is a birthday of someone and we will
[58:16] always celebrate
[58:19] because she loved God
[58:23] she saved
[58:32] We thank God because she came to us all
[58:35] of us being children.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; She was the greatest.
[58:43] We thank the love that she showed to us,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; not only her family but everybody else.
[58:51] So we say
[58:54] &gt;&gt; uh I always think of a song that says
[58:58] when we depart when we
[59:02] surrender apart
[59:06] it gives us inward pain.
[59:10] Yes, we felt the pain,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; but something is comforting us
[59:17] because we will definitely meet again,
[59:23] everybody.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; With that, I'm thankful to everyone
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and God.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; May he keep us together,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; united in his love.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[59:37] [Applause]
[59:41] Uh also let me greet the saints in the
[59:45] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[59:50] and also extend my greetings to
[59:54] the dignitaries and our our leaders.
[1:00:01] I've seen uh several principal that my
[1:00:04] sister served under.
[1:00:12] And uh I want to appreciate their
[1:00:15] support.
[1:00:30] I've been telling them that you are my
[1:00:31] uncle and they
[1:00:34] are here they see. So without waste of
[1:00:37] time,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I would also just read a scripture for
[1:00:43] my sister.
[1:00:46] Uh she was my twin.
[1:00:50] H
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; many of you you don't know.
[1:00:54] H I was born in 1985.
[1:00:58] 1985
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; on the 28th of August 28th August
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; and my sister was born in 1981
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; on the 28th of August 28th.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; So when she departed
[1:01:14] even myself something departed from me
[1:01:18] I will never be the same again
[1:01:24] I'm shattered.
[1:01:27] I was telling my brother Tapel
[1:01:32] that maybe it was supposed to be one of
[1:01:34] us. We are many boys
[1:01:38] and
[1:01:42] men are together. So she was the cushion
[1:01:46] between us.
[1:01:50] Yeah. When that friction starts,
[1:01:55] I have lost again that feminish part.
[1:02:02] We will never be the same again.
[1:02:05] But we are consoled
[1:02:08] as the pastor preached yesterday. We are
[1:02:10] consoled.
[1:02:12] So I'll just touch two things and then
[1:02:15] I'm out here.
[1:02:20] Uh
[1:02:25] my sister one day we applied a visa. The
[1:02:29] pastor was invited in America.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So we went to the consul at Santin for
[1:02:38] interview.
[1:02:41] It was me, my mother and my sister.
[1:02:47] them they were successful.
[1:02:51] I was rejected to go to United
[1:02:53] Stateates.
[1:02:56] I failed the interview.
[1:02:59] Brother Mande was telling me that
[1:03:01] actually you failed before you go.
[1:03:06] Already they perused your profile.
[1:03:11] So she went, she had a privilege to go
[1:03:15] to the land that the prophet was born.
[1:03:20] So
[1:03:22] I'm proud of her because she sacrificed
[1:03:25] every cent as my brother said for this
[1:03:27] ministry
[1:03:33] h with those words
[1:03:36] family friends
[1:03:38] colleagues
[1:03:40] our our fellow church members.
[1:03:46] Thank you. Thank you for everything.
[1:03:49] I have a big family
[1:03:52] cannot die.
[1:03:55] She has sister Sheron cannot die. We see
[1:03:59] him in you
[1:04:02] because she's she was a saint.
[1:04:06] So a saint doesn't die
[1:04:08] but she sleeps. Let me read this
[1:04:11] scripture. The book of Isaiah chapter
[1:04:14] 57.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 57. I will read only verse one
[1:04:21] verse one and two.
[1:04:24] The righteous perisheth
[1:04:27] and no man layeth it to heart
[1:04:32] and the merciful man are taken away.
[1:04:35] None considering that the righteous is
[1:04:39] taken away from the evil to come.
[1:04:43] He shall enter into peace. They shall
[1:04:46] rest in their beds, each one walking in
[1:04:50] his uprightness.
[1:04:54] So
[1:04:55] she died very young. My sister, she was
[1:04:58] 44 years old.
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; To my
[1:05:04] nephews and niece,
[1:05:08] I I'm here.
[1:05:11] H if if I had to choose again,
[1:05:15] Which family would I want to be born?
[1:05:20] And then who
[1:05:23] will be your parents?
[1:05:26] I'll still choose Albert and Esther
[1:05:31] and sister Sharon will I will still
[1:05:33] choose to be my sister.
[1:05:37] What a what a family
[1:05:40] that fear God
[1:05:42] above all.
[1:05:44] So may God console us. Thank you so
[1:05:48] much.
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; God bless the siblings and we proceed
[1:05:58] baselon.
[1:06:00] We calling the children now to come
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:12] be away.
[1:06:15] Now
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:22] in
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:28] the
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:43] Shalom.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Today we celebrate my mother's life.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Mama never wanted us to call her mama.
[1:06:56] We called her
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; girl.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; I will cherish her guidance, support and
[1:07:12] unconditional love.
[1:07:17] Ashes was my rock.
[1:07:23] Ashes was my rock. Her
[1:07:27] love, wisdom, and compassion
[1:07:32] touched countless lives.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for the memories and
[1:07:38] lessons we shared.
[1:07:43] You have run your race, mama.
[1:07:46] We will miss you.
[1:07:48] Truly made up in the sky.
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:08:01] Shalom.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Mama was one of a kind.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; She was a bubbly person,
[1:08:12] selfless and full of life.
[1:08:16] She loved God wholeheartedly.
[1:08:19] And if ever you heard her laughter,
[1:08:22] you know how contagious it was.
[1:08:26] She had a way of giving even when she
[1:08:29] said she didn't have anything.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; When I turned 21,
[1:08:38] mama went all out.
[1:08:41] She celebrated me like a queen.
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:47] If there's one title that she wore with
[1:08:49] confidence with confidence and pride,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; If there's one title she wore with
[1:08:55] confidence and pride,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; it was
[1:09:04] she didn't just carry the name,
[1:09:08] she lived it.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; She would always bring something for the
[1:09:12] little ones.
[1:09:16] Mama always wanted me and her to
[1:09:18] graduate in the same year. Mama
[1:09:24] and
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; she was supposed to graduate on the 3rd
[1:09:26] of June.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Although she won't walk across that
[1:09:32] stage in a cap and gown.
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] I believe she received a far greater
[1:09:40] reward in heaven.
[1:09:44] one that no earthly ceremony could ever
[1:09:47] match.
[1:09:53] What I'll miss the most with mama
[1:09:57] is sharing the word of God with her
[1:10:01] and the late night talks that we always
[1:10:03] had.
[1:10:06] And lastly, to my siblings,
[1:10:09] I know this pain cuts deep.
[1:10:13] as we've lost our pillar,
[1:10:17] our cheerleader,
[1:10:19] and our biggest supporter.
[1:10:22] But I want to remind you of the same God
[1:10:24] that mama reminded us
[1:10:28] so many times.
[1:10:31] I I want I also want you guys to
[1:10:33] remember the path that she took.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm also saying, let's walk through
[1:10:40] the same path.
[1:10:43] until the day God remembers us.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Ah God bless the children. God richly
[1:10:56] bless them. Amen. And then we coming to
[1:11:00] the reading of the obituary
[1:11:04] whose labu will come as we all stand on
[1:11:10] our feet. Amen.
[1:11:34] Can you do media?
[1:11:37] Before
[1:11:46] I read the obituary,
[1:11:50] um I'm just going to like to um kill
[1:11:55] two birds with one stone.
[1:11:58] I just want to pray a short tribute
[1:12:02] by a
[1:12:04] set by John Doe.
[1:12:07] Death be not proud.
[1:12:13] Death be not proud.
[1:12:16] Though some have called thee mighty and
[1:12:19] dreadful,
[1:12:21] thou art not so.
[1:12:24] For those whom thou thinkst thou art to
[1:12:27] overthrow,
[1:12:29] die not, poor death, nor yet const, thou
[1:12:34] kill me, from rest and sleep, but which
[1:12:39] thy pictures be. Much pleasure then from
[1:12:43] thee much more must flow. And soonest
[1:12:48] our best men with thee do go. rest of
[1:12:52] their bones and souls delivery. Though
[1:12:56] art slave to fate, chance kings and
[1:13:00] desperate men and dosed with poison, war
[1:13:05] and sickness dwell, and poppy or charms
[1:13:09] can make us sleep as well, and better
[1:13:13] than thy stroke.
[1:13:16] Why swast though then?
[1:13:20] One short sleep past, we wake eternally
[1:13:24] and death shall be no more. Death though
[1:13:28] shall die.

[1:23:03] but circumstances couldn't allow him. So
[1:23:06] he requested our precious pastor, Pastor

[1:23:17] as we stand on our feet.
[1:23:21] I may not have recognized all the

[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:22] All
[1:24:24] shall be
[1:24:27] as he
[1:24:30] has declared
[1:24:32] to his

[1:24:38] behold
[1:24:41] you
[1:24:46] the prophet.
[1:24:49] Be born
[1:24:51] and gra
[1:24:54] and
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:00] he
[1:25:02] shall tell
[1:25:05] the heart
[1:25:08] of their fathers
[1:25:11] to their children.
[1:25:14] In the heart
[1:25:16] of the children
[1:25:19] to their father
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:25] I come.
[1:25:28] Yes,
[1:25:30] I
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:51] Holy Ghost.
[1:25:54] Holy
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:56] Ghost
[1:25:59] we will
[1:26:02] be
[1:26:07] happy.
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:17] Holy Ghost,
[1:26:20] Holy
[1:26:22] Ghost,
[1:26:25] we will.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I greet
[1:26:34] each and everyone in this hall in the
[1:26:38] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:26:40] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:26:48] Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Once again,
[1:26:53] I'm here to comfort the family
[1:26:58] because we know there is no one who can
[1:27:01] comfort the family.
[1:27:06] People can speak nice ways
[1:27:10] but there is no way it can enter the
[1:27:13] hearts of a man
[1:27:17] except the word of God.
[1:27:21] God is the creator of man.
[1:27:25] is the one who knows how to comfort.
[1:27:30] And that is the reason we are here
[1:27:34] with the word of God
[1:27:37] knowing that perhaps God will comfort
[1:27:39] the family.
[1:27:44] While standing on our feet,
[1:27:47] I'm happy to have pastors here
[1:27:52] and the elders here. I am also greeting
[1:27:55] them.
[1:27:58] I'm happy to have them here.
[1:28:03] Then while standing on our feet,
[1:28:07] I'm not going to take a long time.
[1:28:10] Perhaps
[1:28:12] I'll give the time back to the chorus
[1:28:14] leader to give us some songs
[1:28:22] so that perhaps he may console us with
[1:28:24] those songs
[1:28:28] because I'm not the long man.
[1:28:33] I'm a short man.
[1:28:36] Then we read the book of uh the first
[1:28:39] Thessalonians.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; We read uh chapter 4.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; We read from verse 13 to 16.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; 13-
[1:28:53] 13 to 18.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, 13.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4 13-8.
[1:29:01] But I will not have you to be ignorant,
[1:29:03] brethren, concerning them which are
[1:29:06] asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
[1:29:09] others which have no hope. For if we
[1:29:13] believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[1:29:16] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:29:19] will God bring with him. For this we say
[1:29:22] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[1:29:25] we which are alive and remain unto the
[1:29:29] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:29:31] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[1:29:34] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:29:37] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[1:29:40] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[1:29:43] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[1:29:46] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:29:48] caught up together with them in the
[1:29:50] clouds to meet the Lord
[1:29:53] and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:29:56] Wherefore comfort one another with this.
[1:29:59] Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:30:11] for
[1:30:31] Amen.
[1:30:37] Amen.
[1:30:39] foreign.
[1:30:51] Yes, sir.
[1:31:06] Amen.
[1:31:11] Amen.
[1:31:13] We may take our seats.
[1:31:22] When we are taking our seats,
[1:31:26] my brother, we read the book of Genesis
[1:31:28] chapter
[1:31:30] 4, chapter 23.
[1:31:34] 23
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; uh verse 9.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 9.
[1:31:42] that he may give me the cave of
[1:31:45] Macapella which he hath which is in the
[1:31:49] end of his field. For as much money as
[1:31:53] it is worth, he shall give it to me for
[1:31:55] a possession of a bearing place amongst
[1:31:59] you.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Um I I just want to talk about something
[1:32:04] here.
[1:32:08] Uh this is the topic I want to talk
[1:32:12] about
[1:32:15] is the identified
[1:32:17] burial place of the seed of the royal
[1:32:22] seed of Abraham
[1:32:35] living here on Earth.
[1:32:39] We know we are going to die.
[1:32:46] But what we don't know
[1:32:50] is when we are going to die,
[1:32:54] how we are going to die,
[1:32:59] where we are going to die.
[1:33:03] But death
[1:33:06] We know we are going to die.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And we have said
[1:33:14] death has no reason
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; and death
[1:33:20] you cannot stop it.
[1:33:23] You can stop disease
[1:33:27] but not death
[1:33:29] because death is not caused by disease.
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:39] You can just die
[1:33:42] even if you are not sick.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you can stop death.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; You can stop disease
[1:33:52] but not death.
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:58] You can't uh um
[1:34:03] cure death.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You cannot diagnose.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Death.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If somebody can say I can stop death,
[1:34:18] tell that person you are a liar.
[1:34:24] No one
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; who can stop death.
[1:34:30] Death is just the death.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; But I told you
[1:34:37] that is separation.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Separation
[1:34:45] of men
[1:34:48] with God.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That is what you call death.
[1:34:54] Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; But when I leave this body,
[1:35:00] It's not death.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But because we are used to say is death
[1:35:12] then we say he he has died
[1:35:18] but it's not death.
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; You are born being dead.
[1:35:30] Because
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; you cannot say you are living
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; if you don't have God.
[1:35:39] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; A man
[1:35:44] who can kill his wife
[1:35:50] with an X
[1:35:54] is not the normal man.
[1:35:58] He is dead.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; We are living with people
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; and you cannot solve that.
[1:36:16] Government is making laws
[1:36:20] trying to solve the dead people.
[1:36:29] You cannot solve them
[1:36:32] because these people are dead.
[1:36:37] They are not in their normal.
[1:36:41] You cannot be normal without God.
[1:36:52] The burial,
[1:36:55] the identified the place
[1:37:03] of burial
[1:37:06] of the seed of Abraham.
[1:37:12] The Bible says,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; "Blessed are the dead
[1:37:18] who died in Christ.
[1:37:22] In other words, while we are still
[1:37:25] living here,
[1:37:28] we must identify our burial place.
[1:37:37] Because
[1:37:39] the Bible says, "Blessed are the dead
[1:37:45] who die in Christ."
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:49] They are already buried in Christ.
[1:37:57] Then they have identify their burial
[1:38:00] place.
[1:38:03] Hallelujah. But let me go back to
[1:38:06] Abraham.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:38:11] when his wife has died,
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; he went to
[1:38:20] a place.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He being a prophet,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; he identify the burial place of his
[1:38:32] wife.
[1:38:38] by revelation.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; He identify
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; as a burial place.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Then if you are a royal seed
[1:38:56] of Abraham,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; we can say who are the royal seed of
[1:39:00] Abraham?
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:04] They are the people who have got the
[1:39:06] faith of Abraham.
[1:39:09] Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Those are the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:39:14] But Paul says,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; if you are in Christ,
[1:39:19] then you are the seed of Abraham.
[1:39:22] In our to qualify to be the seed of
[1:39:25] Abraham,
[1:39:28] you must be in Christ.
[1:39:31] Then if you are in Christ,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; then you are the seed of Abraham.
[1:39:36] And if you are the seed of Abraham,
[1:39:40] you must have you must identify your
[1:39:42] burial your burial place
[1:39:47] because Abraham by faith
[1:39:50] by revelation
[1:39:52] he identified his bearing place
[1:39:58] being
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:01] he bought that piece of land
[1:40:05] to be his land
[1:40:08] where he can bury his people.
[1:40:12] He started burying his wife there
[1:40:16] and he also was buried there
[1:40:20] and his son Isaac was buried there.
[1:40:24] Jacob was buried there
[1:40:26] and others were buried there. Even
[1:40:29] Joseph said when he was in Egypt, he
[1:40:32] said when I have died,
[1:40:36] You must not bury me here,
[1:40:39] but you must keep my bones.
[1:40:43] Then when you move,
[1:40:46] you must take my bones and you must go
[1:40:49] and bury me there
[1:40:52] because we have got a bur burial place
[1:40:54] there.
[1:40:57] Joseph's bones.
[1:41:00] Joseph's bones
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; were the memorial
[1:41:06] of to this people that they are going to
[1:41:10] move from this place
[1:41:13] because Joseph said when you move here
[1:41:17] don't leave my bones
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:22] because living
[1:41:24] you are going to leave
[1:41:26] when they look at the bones
[1:41:29] these bones gave them faith
[1:41:33] it was encouragement to death that we
[1:41:36] are going to move here one of the good
[1:41:39] days.
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:41] Why Abraham
[1:41:44] choose this place
[1:41:46] as his burial place
[1:41:50] is because
[1:41:52] Abraham being a prophet
[1:41:55] he had identified
[1:41:58] that job was buried here.
[1:42:02] I him I must be buried where Jo was
[1:42:04] buried.
[1:42:06] Jo was buried there at
[1:42:10] Abraham
[1:42:13] has identified that place
[1:42:17] by revelation
[1:42:18] because he was a prophet.
[1:42:21] Why then Abraham wanted to be buried
[1:42:24] where Job was buried?
[1:42:28] It was because
[1:42:30] Abra job saw has seen the the
[1:42:33] resurrection.
[1:42:37] He has seen that I'm going to die.
[1:42:41] He said even if the the worms can eat
[1:42:43] this body,
[1:42:48] can you read it for me, my brother?
[1:42:51] I I I believe is 19. Let me see here.
[1:42:56] I believe it's Job 19 there
[1:43:01] verse 25.
[1:43:03] Let's just read it. Let's see.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; For I know that my redeemer liveth and
[1:43:10] that he shall stand at the latter day
[1:43:13] upon the earth.
[1:43:15] And though after my skin worms destroyed
[1:43:18] this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
[1:43:21] God. Even if the skin worms can eat this
[1:43:25] boat of life,
[1:43:28] but yet with my own eyes,
[1:43:34] I will see God,
[1:43:36] he saw the resurrection.
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:41] Then Abraham
[1:43:44] knew that this man
[1:43:47] has seen the resurrection. He wanted to
[1:43:50] be he want to be part of job.
[1:43:54] He want to be buried where Job was
[1:43:55] buried
[1:43:58] and they were buried there
[1:44:01] and exactly what what he had believed.
[1:44:08] Jesus was born
[1:44:11] and after his birth
[1:44:13] he grew and he preached and he died
[1:44:18] there.
[1:44:19] And when he when he died, he was buried.
[1:44:23] When he was buried, then he resurrected.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; When he resurrected,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; but let me say this.
[1:44:34] When he died,
[1:44:37] his body was placed in a grave.
[1:44:43] His spirit went to God.
[1:44:47] His soul went to hell.
[1:44:50] Why hell?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; To preach to the souls
[1:44:55] who were in hell
[1:44:57] who didn't believe
[1:45:00] during the message of Noah.
[1:45:04] And those people
[1:45:06] who were in hell there
[1:45:08] were messengers.
[1:45:10] They were preachers. They were pastors
[1:45:13] in those days. They were preaching when
[1:45:16] Noah was preaching,
[1:45:18] but they didn't believe the message of
[1:45:20] Noah.
[1:45:22] They were preaching something against
[1:45:24] what Noah was.
[1:45:27] They were preachers
[1:45:32] and Jesus went to preach to them
[1:45:36] to testify
[1:45:38] that I I am the one who has seen Noah.
[1:45:44] I was the one who was preaching then
[1:45:47] you refused me.
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:52] That that was the third pool of the
[1:45:55] ministry of Jesus. Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; The third pool of the ministry of Jesus
[1:46:03] is when he preach to the lost soul.
[1:46:09] If this ministry,
[1:46:12] if this ministry of the seventh angel
[1:46:14] messenger,
[1:46:17] if this seventh angel messenger,
[1:46:22] it must it must also be the same
[1:46:25] ministry of that of that of of Jesus.
[1:46:31] Is the same minister
[1:46:33] the pool.
[1:46:35] It must to be to the soul.
[1:46:41] And he preached that
[1:46:43] the souls that are imprisoned now
[1:46:47] because it was the same ministry.
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] Evil ministry if the ministry we have
[1:46:57] received
[1:46:58] is the same as the ministry of the
[1:47:00] seventh angel message
[1:47:05] they must preach the souls that
[1:47:10] if your ministry don't reach that state
[1:47:14] it has come short
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] if it is the ministry of chief
[1:47:23] it The third pool of that ministry,
[1:47:27] it must go to the soul
[1:47:32] that cannot repent.
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:39] Yes, sir.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; When when the Bible says
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; he went there.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; When you read first Peter, I think so.
[1:47:53] chapter 3 verse 19. I'm I'm not going to
[1:47:56] read it.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; J Jesus went there
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; to preach.
[1:48:04] After he had preached,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; he he resur he went to he he moved from
[1:48:10] hell
[1:48:13] and he went to paradise.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] You must know in those days
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; paradise
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; paradise
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; it was a place
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; where
[1:48:32] was divided by a a donga like
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:40] the the people who are in hell
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and those who are in paradise.
[1:48:48] They could see one another.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's why the wish of endor
[1:48:57] could go there
[1:49:00] and pick up the soul
[1:49:04] of somewhere
[1:49:06] and bring it back
[1:49:08] because they were at the same
[1:49:12] because the wishes were controlling that
[1:49:16] place.
[1:49:18] but they couldn't control this one. But
[1:49:21] this one was next to this one
[1:49:24] because they they they are they were
[1:49:26] neighbors,
[1:49:28] they could talk to this one.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:33] But when Jesus resurrected,
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; when he when he moved from hell,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; he went to that place.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:49:44] where Abraham
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; and prophets
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; and the saints the old saints
[1:49:53] where they were he went there.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when he reached that
[1:49:59] place
[1:50:00] each and everyone there
[1:50:03] identified him
[1:50:06] the way he had seen him.
[1:50:14] This man is the one I've seen in a bing
[1:50:17] bush.
[1:50:21] He said,
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel said,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; this man was the wheel in the middle of
[1:50:27] the
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:35] when they saw him.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Is this not the fourth man?
[1:50:42] Each and everyone
[1:50:44] was identifying him
[1:50:48] by the way he saw him.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I am what you have seen."
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Come, let's go.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Read Matthew 27. Matthew. Yes.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; 27:50. Let's see it.
[1:51:11] 2750
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; 27 start from verse 51 to 53
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Matthew 27:51
[1:51:24] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:51:26] rent in twain from the top to the bottom
[1:51:30] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[1:51:32] rent and the graves were opened and many
[1:51:36] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; and came out of the graves after his
[1:51:42] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:51:45] and appeared unto many.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; those saints,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; the Bible says the graves were open.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; That is what they have seen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; But the people were not in the graves.
[1:52:07] Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; They were from paradise
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; coming back with Jesus.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; When they come back with
[1:52:18] people saw griefs open
[1:52:23] because when you die here
[1:52:26] this body
[1:52:29] we we bury the body.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; When we bury
[1:52:35] It undergoes some restorations
[1:52:41] so that it must go back
[1:52:44] to the same body that Adam was putting
[1:52:47] on
[1:52:51] because when when we call when we talk
[1:52:53] about the resurrection,
[1:52:56] we don't talk about replacement.
[1:53:00] We we we talk about waking the same body
[1:53:06] which has fallen down.
[1:53:08] We we raise it again
[1:53:11] but in another form.
[1:53:14] It must have been transformed.
[1:53:18] It must have been undergone a system of
[1:53:21] transformation
[1:53:24] because this one is dead.
[1:53:27] It must be transformed.
[1:53:30] But the body which must be transformed
[1:53:34] it must be this one because when I raise
[1:53:38] it must be the same you are looking at
[1:53:45] it. It is not a replacement of
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; they woke up.
[1:53:57] They get inside the city.
[1:54:00] They woke up all Job and others
[1:54:05] who were buried in Mabella
[1:54:09] because Mabella was a resurrection
[1:54:11] place.
[1:54:14] That's why Abraham wanted his wanted his
[1:54:17] people to be buried there.
[1:54:21] see that there will be a resurrection
[1:54:23] here
[1:54:25] and according to the book here. The
[1:54:28] resurrection happened there.
[1:54:34] [Applause]
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:35] People were buried there.
[1:54:38] They were all resurrected
[1:54:40] and they went into the city. They move
[1:54:43] around the city
[1:54:45] for 40 days.
[1:54:48] People
[1:54:50] seen them
[1:54:52] and not seen them. They appear and
[1:54:55] disappear
[1:54:58] and disappear.
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:01] But people have seen them.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; They have been resurrected.
[1:55:08] When Jesus
[1:55:10] rise,
[1:55:13] when he ascend to heaven,
[1:55:16] the Bible said they ascended to heaven
[1:55:19] with him.
[1:55:25] Are you listening?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; If you were there,
[1:55:35] Yeah. Which side will you be in?
[1:55:39] All right. The Bible says
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; they ascended to heaven.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; When they ascended up to heaven, they
[1:55:48] ascended up to heaven like a cloud.
[1:55:53] When the disciples look at them,
[1:55:56] that's what the Bible said. He has risen
[1:55:59] with a cloud.
[1:56:02] That cloud was those resurrected.
[1:56:08] The Bible says the way you are seeing
[1:56:12] him rising,
[1:56:15] he will come the same way.
[1:56:18] In other words, he'll come back
[1:56:20] with the saints again. He's rising with
[1:56:23] the saints. He will come back with the
[1:56:25] saints.
[1:56:27] The same way you are seeing him rising,
[1:56:30] he will come back. The same way because
[1:56:33] he rises the saints, he will come back
[1:56:36] with the saints.
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:42] Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; It's your Bible.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking something which is not
[1:56:47] in the Bible.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; They resurrected,
[1:56:52] they
[1:56:54] with him. And the Bible says the same
[1:56:57] way you will see him rising he will come
[1:57:00] back the same way.
[1:57:03] And when we read in Luke he said he will
[1:57:07] come back in with clouds.
[1:57:16] Do you see it?
[1:57:20] where we have read
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; the Bible says
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; is that for if we believe that Jesus
[1:57:33] died and rose again.
[1:57:40] Even so them also which slept in Jesus
[1:57:48] You know that they have identified their
[1:57:51] burial place.
[1:57:56] They are buried in Christ.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; That is what the Bible is saying here,
[1:58:04] my brother. Read something here. I'm I'm
[1:58:06] going to come back. Reap 14:3. Read it.
[1:58:10] Let's hear it.
[1:58:15] Revelation 14:3.
[1:58:20] And I heard a voice from heaven, saying
[1:58:22] unto me, write, blessed are the dead
[1:58:26] which die in the Lord from henceforth.
[1:58:30] Yeah. Saying, sayeth the spirit, that
[1:58:33] they may rest from their labors, and
[1:58:36] their works do follow them.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Say,
[1:58:42] Blessed are the dead
[1:58:46] who die in Christ
[1:58:50] for they are going to rest.
[1:58:54] You must identify
[1:58:57] the place where you want to be buried.
[1:58:59] Amen.
[1:59:02] Burial place.
[1:59:04] Why you are still living here?
[1:59:06] Identify your burial place.
[1:59:10] The Bible says here those who are buried
[1:59:13] in Christ
[1:59:16] they they are going they are going to
[1:59:18] rest.
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:23] He says, "For if we believe
[1:59:27] that Jesus died
[1:59:30] and rose again,
[1:59:33] even so,
[1:59:35] them also who slept in Jesus
[1:59:40] will God bring with him.
[1:59:47] Who will he bring with him?
[1:59:52] those who are buried in him.
[1:59:58] If you baptize in his name,
[2:00:02] you you are buried with him. You die
[2:00:05] with him and you are buried with him.
[2:00:08] You are resurrected.
[2:00:11] Amen.
[2:00:14] Those who are buried in him,
[2:00:19] he will come with them. Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; During what we call the first
[2:00:27] resurrection,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus will leave the seventh. Because
[2:00:35] when when they resurrected,
[2:00:39] when they rose again with him,
[2:00:45] he left them at the sixth dimension
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; because paradise was destroyed.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; When paradise was destroyed,
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; now it became two separate things.
[2:01:05] It was the fifth dimension
[2:01:08] which is hell.
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:13] Hell
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; is divided into three.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; That is hell. Those places are hell.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; The first place
[2:01:26] is where the souls
[2:01:30] of those who didn't believe
[2:01:34] They're unjust.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; They they go there when they die.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; The the second place
[2:01:46] is where demons are
[2:01:49] they operate from there.
[2:01:53] When they operate in space,
[2:01:55] they are they are operating from there.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That is the head office.
[2:02:04] They move from there and operate in
[2:02:07] space and here on earth
[2:02:10] because the war is fought in space
[2:02:16] on earth and in water.
[2:02:20] Satan is also typing that.
[2:02:25] He's he's fighting in space.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; He's fighting on earth. He's fighting
[2:02:30] down there.
[2:02:33] in water.
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; If you don't you don't believe it. I
[2:02:38] tell you,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting in water.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Is this dwelling place?
[2:02:48] Is this his office?
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; When you move from the the second
[2:03:02] You go to the third. The third is where
[2:03:06] Satan himself dwell.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; All these places
[2:03:14] is hell.
[2:03:17] Are you together with me?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Then we call the first one
[2:03:24] which is where the spirit of dust dwell.
[2:03:32] We call it the fifth dimension.
[2:03:36] But when you move from there, you go to
[2:03:40] where demons are.
[2:03:42] When you move from there, you go to
[2:03:44] where the Satan himself is.
[2:03:50] Thus the
[2:03:54] th man of God.
[2:03:57] When you go up, heaven is divided into
[2:04:01] three.
[2:04:04] There is the first heaven
[2:04:07] and the second heaven and the second.
[2:04:11] Satan Satan is copying.
[2:04:15] When God had three heavens,
[2:04:19] Satan said I will have three hell.
[2:04:26] When you move from here,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; you go to the first heaven.
[2:04:32] That is what we call the sixth
[2:04:33] dimension.
[2:04:36] Then you go to the seven, the second.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Then you go to the the third
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; where God dwell.
[2:04:47] Then we call it the seventh dimension.
[2:04:52] Jesus will move from the seven dimension
[2:04:56] and go to the sixth dimension
[2:05:00] during the first resurrection.
[2:05:04] Are you listening?
[2:05:06] I'm teaching you.
[2:05:08] [Applause]
[2:05:14] When things when one of us pass away,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; we teach one another.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; But if you happen to be where we teach
[2:05:26] one another,
[2:05:30] just listen
[2:05:32] and be taught.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; But the main aim
[2:05:38] is to teach one another.
[2:05:42] and encourage one another.
[2:05:45] When we are living here, we must know
[2:05:49] those who don't believe this message of
[2:05:52] ours,
[2:05:54] they are going there. And when because
[2:05:58] we believe this message,
[2:06:00] we are going there. We are separating
[2:06:03] here.
[2:06:05] This message is separating the word of
[2:06:08] God.
[2:06:09] brings a separation.
[2:06:13] [Applause]
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Then when you will move from the the
[2:06:19] seven dimension
[2:06:21] and went to the sixth
[2:06:24] and pick the souls
[2:06:27] of the Russians
[2:06:30] of the saints who have passed away.
[2:06:35] When one of us pass away
[2:06:39] We believe that he's going there
[2:06:42] to the sixth dimension. He's going to
[2:06:44] rest
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; waiting for those who go to the fifth
[2:06:51] dimension.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; It is a waiting trial. Please
[2:07:05] those who were once arrested.
[2:07:08] They know that
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; after being arrested
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; you go to jail
[2:07:21] but you are in jail
[2:07:26] and there you you are in trouble. You in
[2:07:28] pain WhatsApp.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; You get other thugs beating you up.
[2:07:36] You are waiting trial
[2:07:40] when you die. We are waiting trial
[2:07:43] for the fifth dimension.
[2:07:50] You're waiting for judgment.
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:54] I'm I'm bringing judgment here.
[2:07:59] The Bible says I'm a judge.
[2:08:04] That is what the Bible says.
[2:08:06] I'm the church.
[2:08:09] Hallelujah.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; At the second resurrection
[2:08:13] at the white throne judgment,
[2:08:17] God is just going to lay down the
[2:08:20] judgment.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Because next because you've been you
[2:08:28] have already been judged.
[2:08:32] You go to hell. God
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; because because as as you have been
[2:08:37] judged,
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; you must go to hell for for
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; forever
[2:08:46] for everlasting.
[2:08:49] It's not eternal.
[2:08:52] It's for everlasting.
[2:08:56] As you have been judged,
[2:08:59] you must just go to hell.
[2:09:02] As you have been judged,
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; then you go to heaven.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; As you have been judged.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Judgment is is presented here now.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; He will take them.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; And bring and come with them.
[2:09:27] Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; And when when he is between heaven and
[2:09:31] earth,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus will remain there.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Christ will remain there.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Then the saints
[2:09:44] who are in the sixth dimension,
[2:09:47] they will come down.
[2:09:50] Hallelujah.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because we have got three bodies.
[2:09:57] This is the body
[2:09:59] we are wearing.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible say so. If this tabernacle be
[2:10:05] dissolved,
[2:10:07] we have another
[2:10:11] you must read the Bible. The Bible says
[2:10:13] if this earthly tabernacle
[2:10:16] a tabern is is a is a temporary shelter
[2:10:24] when the people children of Israel were
[2:10:26] moving from Egypt to Canaan
[2:10:30] they were living in tabernac
[2:10:40] they celebrated that feast in Canaan.
[2:10:42] And there
[2:10:46] remembering when they were still moving
[2:10:48] in
[2:10:51] are you together with me then because
[2:10:54] the Bible says if this
[2:10:59] means we are in a temporary shelter
[2:11:06] we are going that's why he says we have
[2:11:09] got a house.
[2:11:11] He doesn't know if we have got another
[2:11:13] tabernacle.
[2:11:15] He said you have got a house
[2:11:19] because now that one is not a
[2:11:20] tabernacle,
[2:11:22] it's a house. This one is a tabernacle.
[2:11:27] When it when the Bible speaks about
[2:11:29] tabernacles and house,
[2:11:33] it is it was speaking about bodies.
[2:11:38] is a
[2:11:41] house.
[2:11:44] The Paul say he says you we have got
[2:11:48] earthly earthly bodies
[2:11:52] and we have got heavenly bodies
[2:11:56] and he's calling this one a corrupt.
[2:12:05] This one is is mortal.
[2:12:09] But he's talking about another one which
[2:12:12] is incorruptible,
[2:12:15] which is immortal
[2:12:18] at this point. At this point,
[2:12:24] I'm trying to to to give you an
[2:12:27] appetite.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:32] Then this this this one
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; in English they call it terrestrial
[2:12:39] terrestrial.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; And then when you move from this
[2:12:43] terrestrial
[2:12:48] if you go to another one is called the
[2:12:50] theophony
[2:12:55] which is the heavenly body.
[2:12:58] Then when you move from when when they
[2:13:01] come where we have right here when Jesus
[2:13:05] move from the seven
[2:13:08] coming to the
[2:13:11] in the sixth
[2:13:13] the the the saints which are there.
[2:13:17] They are in their theophanes
[2:13:19] theophanes. Then he will take them there
[2:13:24] in those theophanes.
[2:13:26] Then they will come here
[2:13:29] to pick up another body.
[2:13:33] They will take they will take another.
[2:13:36] This one is
[2:13:38] they were there in the theophanes.
[2:13:41] When they come here on earth, they going
[2:13:43] to take another body which is a
[2:13:46] glorified body.
[2:13:49] The body like that one of
[2:13:54] I can say to you
[2:13:56] That boot doesn't have another.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Will you refuse or will you believe
[2:14:07] another
[2:14:09] connect with your mother?
[2:14:14] What is the in the in the glorified
[2:14:16] Buddhist?
[2:14:22] Oh, we don't we don't believe don't take
[2:14:25] it. Leave it.
[2:14:29] But I tell you,
[2:14:33] connect with your mother.
[2:14:37] But in the in that body, glorified body,
[2:14:40] what is the N
[2:14:42] used for?
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:47] You have got the theophony. You have got
[2:14:50] the
[2:14:52] You have got the the theophony.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Then you have got the glorified one.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; This this one
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; we can touch.
[2:15:03] Work with it.
[2:15:05] But this one you cannot touch
[2:15:09] but you can see but you can hear but you
[2:15:12] cannot touch.
[2:15:15] This this theophony body.
[2:15:19] This what is the body that we loosed
[2:15:22] there?
[2:15:25] We loosed
[2:15:28] from Adam. There
[2:15:30] is the body created by God himself
[2:15:34] not born of a woman
[2:15:37] but created by God. God will create that
[2:15:40] body
[2:15:42] then will get into that body. Those who
[2:15:45] are still living here they will change
[2:15:48] this one.
[2:15:49] [Applause]
[2:15:50] All right. All right. All right.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me tell you
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; living here.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; I told you
[2:16:03] the word of God.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; It is used as cells.
[2:16:09] Cell
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; the cell
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; because
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; a cell
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; upon a cell
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; and it will make an organ
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; from an organ it will make an organism
[2:16:26] then
[2:16:28] is the weight upon weight.
[2:16:32] Why are we still here preaching?
[2:16:35] Because we are building cells in you.
[2:16:40] It must be a cell upon a cell. Cell upon
[2:16:43] a cell until
[2:16:46] God is satisfied that the organism has
[2:16:48] been created
[2:16:53] in this age. Now
[2:16:57] those who have received this message,
[2:17:01] they've received their theophanes
[2:17:05] in them.
[2:17:07] Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 10.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; This angel coming down
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; with a book
[2:17:17] is coming is bringing back the
[2:17:19] theophanes.
[2:17:23] What you have missed there?
[2:17:26] This seven angel messenger is bringing
[2:17:28] back
[2:17:30] into you. All right. All right. All
[2:17:32] right. Just listen here.
[2:17:36] When when he is coming with the saints
[2:17:40] which are which which are in their
[2:17:42] theophanes,
[2:17:44] they must find us here
[2:17:47] with our theophanis inside.
[2:17:51] We can we cannot change to another body.
[2:17:55] If we have if we don't have our
[2:17:57] theophony
[2:17:59] theophanes going to put on glorified
[2:18:01] body
[2:18:05] we don't we are not going to sh the
[2:18:07] theophanes
[2:18:09] theophanes are going to be put in a
[2:18:11] glorified body
[2:18:16] if you don't have a theophony
[2:18:18] then you don't have a glorified body
[2:18:24] that's why Because those have got their
[2:18:26] theophanes already.
[2:18:28] That's why God brought our theophanes
[2:18:32] in revelation chapter 10 which is the
[2:18:35] revelation of the seventh seal I man.
[2:18:45] [Music]
[2:18:45] [Applause]
[2:18:50] You cannot receive
[2:18:54] this the supernatural message
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; because when our seven angel messenger
[2:19:08] went to west.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; He was going to connect
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; with something.
[2:19:19] the same way. Amen.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Coming back
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; connected.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; That's why.
[2:19:35] He was coming with another commission
[2:19:40] and that commission
[2:19:43] will be only
[2:19:46] received
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; or it will only be heard.
[2:19:52] Those who have their theophanes,
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; they brought the theophanes
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; so that you can be able
[2:20:05] They were they were preparing us
[2:20:09] for the message coming
[2:20:12] because beside that we wouldn't
[2:20:15] understand
[2:20:21] when they come in their theophony
[2:20:25] they must find those who have got
[2:20:26] theophony
[2:20:30] so they can change this bodies
[2:20:33] and take another
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:37] That is the first reason I get
[2:20:41] are those who
[2:20:43] have identified
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; their burial place
[2:20:50] which is in Christ.
[2:20:55] Amen. How do you become part of
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:03] you? You become part of the family
[2:21:06] by marriage.
[2:21:09] [Applause]
[2:21:12] He brought the weight
[2:21:15] to propose you
[2:21:18] [Music]
[2:21:21] then because
[2:21:23] just
[2:21:26] You are predestinated.
[2:21:29] You you can hear this word.
[2:21:32] But this word is the word of my husband.
[2:21:36] That's why he calls those
[2:21:39] his sheep.
[2:21:42] He calls them his family members.
[2:21:47] Jesus himself,
[2:21:49] he said they are my brethren.
[2:21:54] Paul says he is the firstborn
[2:21:58] among his brethren
[2:22:01] that's why he is our brother.
[2:22:08] Then he has prepared them
[2:22:12] to be part.
[2:22:15] He proposed you this way.
[2:22:19] Then you accept the way
[2:22:22] and when you go to be baptized.
[2:22:26] It is a public testimony
[2:22:30] that I have received this man.
[2:22:34] Because if the man has proposed you
[2:22:37] that man says let us marry
[2:22:45] there is something wrong
[2:22:49] you because marriage is a public
[2:22:51] testimony
[2:22:54] when you propose one another you were
[2:22:56] together there no one was looking at you
[2:23:00] but we see when they tell us these two M
[2:23:04] and two that are going to marry on this
[2:23:06] such and such day. Then we come all and
[2:23:10] we're going to see the two in public
[2:23:15] [Applause]
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:17] when you have had the weight then you
[2:23:19] must be baptized
[2:23:22] how in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:23:25] for the remission of your sin
[2:23:29] then you become that's why he said now
[2:23:33] I I I have to go to the Gentiles
[2:23:36] [Music]
[2:23:37] to take people
[2:23:40] for his name.
[2:23:43] I'm going to take them for the name.
[2:23:46] When you take When you take a woman, you
[2:23:49] take the woman to the name because he's
[2:23:53] take he's taking another name,
[2:23:57] [Applause]
[2:23:59] the name of Jesus Christ. He is Mrs.
[2:24:02] Jesus Christ
[2:24:07] in a supernatural
[2:24:12] she's already married
[2:24:14] but this is a supernatural one
[2:24:17] that's why the the marriage officer
[2:24:21] marriage officer when he was preaching
[2:24:25] he preached a certain book
[2:24:28] the invisible you know
[2:24:31] That is the invisible marriage.
[2:24:35] But we have got another visible one
[2:24:39] in the merry supper.
[2:24:42] But we go there because the invisible
[2:24:46] has already been done.
[2:24:49] [Music]
[2:24:55] Identify.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Identify
[2:24:59] you are buried
[2:25:05] while living here.
[2:25:10] You know, I'm I'm I'm I'm happy about
[2:25:13] these white people.
[2:25:16] When some if someone dies in the family,
[2:25:18] they come
[2:25:22] now, they take this,
[2:25:26] they actually want to find out what
[2:25:28] caused the death. Now, after finding the
[2:25:31] death, now they go back home.
[2:25:34] They going to vaccinate the remaining
[2:25:37] ones.
[2:25:38] Now I'm also
[2:25:41] vaccinating.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; I'm the chorus leader. I said I'm going
[2:26:00] to allow you to just give us choruses
[2:26:06] so that you can console us
[2:26:11] with choruses
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; whilst waiting for the hash.
[2:26:16] God bless you.
[2:26:18] Let's close our eyes
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; to thank God for the message. Oh dear
[2:26:25] heavenly father,
[2:26:27] there is nothing we can present to your
[2:26:30] children
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; beside what you have brought to us.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; You have given us
[2:26:40] something
[2:26:42] that is
[2:26:45] beyond human understanding.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Is just in a supernatural form.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:55] And you have to you have said through
[2:26:58] your messenger
[2:27:00] when people have reached the sixth
[2:27:04] to go to the se the seventh into the
[2:27:08] king's chamber
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; they need a challenger
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; who will go and pick them
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; because that step you cannot take it
[2:27:19] yourself.
[2:27:21] The last step you have brought
[2:27:24] when the pulpit when the pyramid was
[2:27:27] opened
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; there was no one who could could get in
[2:27:30] into that could understand what it is
[2:27:34] into that.
[2:27:36] So the prophet said I must go to the
[2:27:38] west because someone
[2:27:42] must come and transfer us
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; into that other pyramid. Amen.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for your message
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; and thank you for what you have done to
[2:27:55] us.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; This is by grace
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; is not what man can do
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; is what you have done to us.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Bless each and every one of us here
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; with the message preached. Amen.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; If there is anything which have gone out
[2:28:16] through the message we were preaching
[2:28:19] which is not from you,
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; let it not get into the ears of your
[2:28:24] children
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; because it's the aim of the devil
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; to divert
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; beautiful things which you want to bring
[2:28:33] to your children.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Be with us with the family. be with each
[2:28:38] and every one of us here.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; I pray in the precious name of our Lord
[2:28:44] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; God bless.
[2:28:53] Hallelujah.
[2:29:00] Ah, God is good. Yeah. You see

[2:59:23] God must need another angel
[2:59:28] around the throne tonight.
