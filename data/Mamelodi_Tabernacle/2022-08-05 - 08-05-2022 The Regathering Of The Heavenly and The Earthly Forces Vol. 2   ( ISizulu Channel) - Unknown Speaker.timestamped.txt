[3:16] father i would like to thank you lordy
[3:17] that
[3:19] from the service first service father

[3:41] now father i would like to thank you
[3:42] lord that when you look at us
[3:44] you stop lord

[3:49] now father i would like to thank you
[3:50] that lord our to your friend you have
[3:52] molded them father for their weight
[3:55] so their weight is coming from their way
[3:57] to the weight
