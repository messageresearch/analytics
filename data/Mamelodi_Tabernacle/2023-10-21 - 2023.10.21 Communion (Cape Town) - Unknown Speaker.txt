Description:
Title: Communion Service
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on the 21 October 2023 at Cape Town.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Genesis 14:18-20, John 6:53, John 4: 29, Matthews 26: 26 -29  John 13: 2-17
Communion is not for everyone and is not for the public. When you have eternal life you will drink his blood and eat his flesh. When God loves you he will give you Himself, so that you can be like Him. 
Melchizedek was not seen by everyone, he was only seen by Abraham and his seed. 
The Seventh Seal was not preached it was revealed, same as the Third pull He revealed it. Some of the things in the bible are not opened for the public.
When God has given us of Himself, he called it Communion. The Church of God is the image of God.
A prophet is God’s reflector. The reflector doesn’t reflect itself, the reflector isn’t the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector—reflector to make it reflect. 
The problem today is that people who talk to God, who in turn God doesn't talk to them. I believe that the God whom we worship, is the God whom we can commune with and he in turn can commune with us.
If you are in the body, you will be received in the body. God doesn’t talk to the people back because of their Sins. A true Christian will talk to God and God will talk back to him or her.

called communed introduced by the Lord Jesus Christ while we are standing I wish to ask our pastor M for a prayer before we read the word of God to introduce us to him in a prayer as we bow our heads amen e for down for amen amen God bless Pastor okay amen our brother is going to read while [Music] standing a scripture for us and then we believe God will bless us in this few moments given to us Genesis Genesis chter 14 Genesis chter 14 vers 18 to 20 and MC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all and John chapter 6 verse uh 53 Yan chapter 6 ver 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except he eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he have no life in you God bless you as you take your seats okay this evening uh we have come for the communion communion is a communion is a special service amen amen that's why it was not Ser to the public but to The Chosen even today commun is not taken by the public but it is taken by the it is revealed to The Chosen okay the pure in heart the body of Christ all right it is the body of Christ that can take the body of Christ is those Of The Bloodline of Christ who can take communion amen amen so that's why he calls us the body all right and I read here we have the prophet brother Bram amen so he tells us of this communion it's not really a preaching someone but I will read some few things and we take communion amen so we read the Bible that king of know in the Bible you will realize that not everybody has seen But Abraham and the seed of amen amen in the last days not everybody can see you know brother Bram says you need to meet and in the book again in that Hebrew Book he has asked a question saying have you ever met MC since the battle is over amen amen now uh now you ask you can ask yourself which battle he is talking about but thenc king of now you know every King has got some subjects and the people who serve under that King are called the subjects of the king amen amen and now I read some few things here from our Prophet um he says now before we go to take to the communion table the blood and the body of the Lord mixed with faith does the blood and the body mixed with faith the body okay I he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life actually what he's saying is if you have eternal life you will eat his flesh and drink his blood if you have eternal life okay and now I read here it is MC who came to Abraham now brother says what what happened was that gave Abraham of himself because if God loves you he will give you of himself that is pure love did you hear it if God loves you he will give you he want you to become him all right but actually if we look into the Bible like the seventh seal the seal that is not for everybody no it's not to the public as he says then you'll wonder if it is not for public it's for whom because there's somebody who's not the public now if he says the seventh seal is not open to the public you know because you can't preach it he did he didn't preach it he revealed it you know so that is one of the things you should take note of that like he speaks about the third pool is the things that he didn't preach but he revealed now that's why when they open the seven seal when he opened the silent in heaven not not on and because he didn't preach it he opened it as we have said last Sunday I think you have heard that suay that things like the third pool he says it's not to the Now find the word what it means it's not for everybody so that's why some say it is not revealed it is not for [Music] everybody now the public don't know about it but there must be some people to whom he has revealed it not preached it opened unto them their secret because if it is a secret then it can be open to everybody special for this people ordained amen [Music] amen we have seen even in the Bible that in Genesis Genesis he says number one it was God Theos then the men all right amen so if he says some of the things in the Bible are not revealed to the public we are going to see here that this threefold and which is you are part of the threefold now if you are part of the threefold you are not the public the public is the person who are not part of the threefold mystery of God now do you know that you are part of the threefold that's why in the Bible as I was listening to brother Bram saying it was godos the man that is one thing amen amen now if I am not part of that then that would put me aside as now when he reveals it comes as brother bam says life comes in three if he reveals it comes in three that's why he spoke of Father Son and Holy Ghost but yet speaking of one which is God himself amen amen now we have seen enough of the public he says it's so many times not revealed to the public even tonight if you they have a Services service service you find so many people when it is music singing and just preaching just a message you find many people but when it comes where it is God himself taking the pit I am not God we but all together as we are gathered here we are one thing now we who are of him because he says he has given Abraham of himself if God has given us of himself that's why the prophet says then the Bible says when he made man he made him in his own image surely the people should look at the church and see the image of God the real Church of God image of God it's not just a church it should reflect God himself and if you see God he is a reflect reflection which one is reflect there is a reflector and the reflection between man and God which one is the reflector can somebody answer that reflector reflector what is the work of a [Music] reflector you have it on your car reflectors what is the work of the reflector because there's a reflector which part is the reflector I don't hear Brother that thing of your no volume there okay all right now brother speaks of that now I I'm still waiting for a answer the drivers what is a reflector put it put it on for me brother reflector and there's a reflector a reflection here is a piece of paper God bless you now brother speaks of that now he says he himself became part I mean he made us part of himself you know the world talking this brother is serving there this brother is serving there this brother is serving there but in Christ we worship in Christ no not not in or the old home no we worship where the true worshippers shall worship the father okay now he speaks of the true worshippers because they can reflect back to their creator who said let us make men in our image all right amen God didn't make a man somebody else but he made man in his own image that is the only image I know because even churches are like images like the pope can say Roman Catholic is my image a truth worshiper will worship God in truth and spirit in spirit and in truth but truth is the word of God that is revealed you know there's a word of God and they reveal the word of God there is a message the revealed message there is the bride and the revealed bride if it is not revealed it just remain as the word but if it is not revealed it is not talking about God it's it is called religion now religion and Christianity is two different things some people ask are you religious amen amen and say yeah I'm religious I go I I go to church every Sunday now all right let's finish here this is what the Lord has given us just to read here [Applause] uh this night this commun I'd like to explain says the prophet I'm sure the brother is still trying to find for me refle reflector or reflection and ref one is reflection ref now what is reflection you any reflection you can answer me brother what is re reflection reflection something that shows there's something that is there when there's a light amen yes to show there's a car that is on the other side all right amen okay that's that's why when go when God made you he made you what a reflector actually which one between God and man is a reflector I'm I'm waiting for the answer the brother is still praying there between reflector and reflection speaks about it all right am I wanted to hear from the church itself children of God reflector reflector it says men here you agree brother you agree say reflector reflector then an object okay the brother has answered let's carry let's leave it here and carry on all right uh what's on your car you call it what reflector reflector is it a reflector reflector what is the work of a reflector reflector is to give a sign that I'm going this way I'm going this way then it's a reflector you agree all right now I quot here they said the prophet and it's I think is this a few moments that the Lord has given us communion is to talk and it talks back that's why brother Bram says [Music] when MC met Abraham he gave him himself he gave him of himself is that right now listen to brother communion is to talk that's to commune and and it talks back something that you talk to and uh because communion is only taken by the bride of Christ the people whom he talks to and they talk back to him communion is not everywhere is between God and the people he will talk to and in they will talk back to so it's not taken by everybody is for those who can talk back to God if we can't talk back to God then we can't take communion and that's why we are here it's a sign that we have come we have heard him now we come to respond back to God that it is our agreement between us and God the real agreement you have is should it should be between you and God uh all right sometimes I I was I used to be an Assembly of God member we have had so many meetings like today there more meetings of men talking to another man than a meeting of men talking to God people would love to hear some people talking about God singing God for to hear God himself that's one they they cannot they they can tolerate to talk about God but they can't tolerate if God talks to them is that right now the difference here like brother says communion is to talk and and and it talks back if you talk and it doesn't talk backun that's why we here because we have he him and we also have talked back we have answered you we have [Applause] him those men are who followed the Samaritan woman they said to the Samaritan woman after they have met the Lord Jesus Christ woman thank you for your testimony but now we have heard him ourself that's communion we our we have him our have you have you heard him or you hear about him hear the people talking about you and have you heard him yourself because if you say that man says God is this and this you are not saying it you are carrying something of some from somebody I hear that they say a prophet amen amen but there's a there's some who says brother Bram is a prophet sent by God and somebody says I hear that is a prophet okay that's the difference there are some who used to come to worship I know of some with us who came to worship and today are here on YouTube and they're saying brother Brenham is a cult brother Bram is this and so but they worshiped with us even paid ties but they didn't meet and today the very same people who came to church and worship with us saying is a false prophet what is that they have never met God they have about you my brother do you know that scripture the Samaritan woman testified to this people you know the scripture yes read the scripture and then we are fin we are through John chapter 4 yes uh from verse 29 come see a man which told me all things that ever I did that is the Samaritan woman see a man did what told me all things who told me she recognized the Lord because he told her all things I've been longing for such a message where the Lord will tell me all things I've been longing for such a fellowship you know people go to church they come back with half a small portion maybe among of all the that was pre what they have was Jesus was born in Bethlehem but now in the Bible this woman says come and see a he didn't say an angel a man you know you should find that man who can tell you all things a true Witness all right amen there preachers ordained every day okay but can we find one the one who can tell us all [Music] things I remember a brother complaining he went and met H he's a Elder and ask him a question scriptural question and he said to and the the pastor that Pastor said to this brother the brother is asking this man because he is a pastor he he called read the Bible now how can a shepher tell the Sheep go and because the shepherd don't know so he says today ship read the Bible but the Sheep expected to hear everything from the shepherd all right now let's we finishing with this except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood there is no life in you is the same scripture that one in Genesis showing that who is thisis in the New Testament here comes the same meis but now in the form as brother bam says MC became Jesus okay then finally when the prophet he preached to us and saided who became Jesus he came now as a prophet okay amen have you seen that then brother said I have I I am glad I met that then he says that Abraham met him when he was on the earth working and he says that milis became Jesus but at the end of time he speaks of MEC and saying he came as a prophet all right now because there's a body the word of God and his body of Flesh now the people who are PR are not confused because by by The Mask because he changes his mask now if you know him you don't know him by the mask that you looking at because he's an Insider so you that's why says you are an Insider Insider would know God not the frame because God is in a body now if you know him he says you are an Insider you take it online you take it online because if he is in the body he will be received in the body now there's something in your body this body that I'm looking at but there's something in in that body that can see something in that body that's why the Samaritan woman says she was waiting for that word to be made flesh so she was walking around saying I know Messiah coming and when he is come he will tell us all things now this woman she was not waiting just for the gospel she was waiting for the man who tell her all things person who wants to hear all things is believing he has believed to all things which is God he expected to hear all things okay now as we are going to take communion that's why we are saying it says let me read this communion to talk to talk and it talks back if you talk it doesn't talk back it's not then he says something that you talk to the very communion means to talk to that's why you say you have come for communion right if then it is not by Revelation that's why some they take it they take the cool drink because it is not by revelation we met some in Vendor somewhere we met some and they just Ser this cold drink they buy from the shop I don't know what it is called uh grape juice grape juice grap juice amen then we were there with some brothers they talked about saving the communion that was just grape juice grape juice now I don't believe great juice can uh reflect the blood of Christ but the Bible says that was in in our language all right let me leave it in our language but in Jerusalem it was made was that brother all right Prophet a reflector of God God bless you it says the prophet a reflector of God all right now we have it we'll use it again the last thing here let's take this last thing here in this book communion communion is to talk and it talks back meaning if he doesn't talk back notun something that you talk to like if we talk to God then God should talk back to us all right now the very word commune means to talk or be associated with something that toen back to you all right I I will finish here can you talk to somebody who doesn't talk back to you no can you worship a God who doesn't answer you who doesn't talk back to you okay in many cases don't answer the people because of their sin it is so in the Bible but we we should really become Christians in this manner a real Christian can talk to God God can talk back to not just keep talking there is no response real Christian somebody who talks to God and God talks back to [Music] him all right like brother Bram he could talk to God and God in back to him then he brings to ask the [Music] people they the the revelation of God not the preaching now don't mix Revelation with preaching preaching worldwide preaching one says this is revealed one says now what we need is the Revelation that's why the Bible says when he opened the seven SE not when he preached it because the seals are revealed are not preached if you expect somebody to preach the seals know that the seals are revealed when he opened the seventh seal not when he preached the seven and people are expecting him to preach the seventh but it's a revelation not a preaching it's not even a teaching if something is revealed to you it is revealed to you and you have received it by Revelation not by explanation that's why people are expl are the they are looking for explanation and then somebody says oh yeah I see it like this but in God it's not I see it like this no it's what is [Music] revealed what is revealed to you is unlike what is taught okay that's why the Bible says when he opened not when he preached it must be open right that's why he open that to Abraham when he gave him of himself called it communion because Abraham was able to talk to to MCC to AB now I'll tell you this now it is like this I was listening to brother Bram saying today can you can you hear MC today can you receive all right that's why he says who is this MEC and he says I am glad he could it sorry something in me brother says something in [Music] him and the people are still looking for MEC but when he brings it he says you too must meet he was God he became Jesus and he came as a prophet that is what we read okay amen now the Insiders as brother he says I'm glad that something in me now he doesn't say I he say something in me all right you to if something in you met you can say it something in you because there's a way and the revealed word now most of the people hear the word we never had the revealed word that's the difference is it revealed or is it just the way because everybody can say God but you ask them who is God then you'll see the difference God bless you as the deons let me read this and the deons will prepare here talk to God right I remember last Sunday when I was supposed to get ready for the service I had a problem with my leg but since now there was this in my mind now not the head no your your your mind inside that the children of God are waiting for they are waiting there they are in the Tabernacle now I must go to the Tabernacle I told the children of God then I I look for a I don't know what they call it that they give to the people who have have some problems with legs I look for one home amen all right and I tried it I said I do this be able to stand up and preach then I I I I thought but I haven't spoken to God about it I'm just doing things if if this leg is painful I won't go to service if this is I won't do that now I said now I've been talking alone then I decided to talk to God because it was like I am talking to myself and nothing was happening I'm talking to myself that this leg of mine I don't know whether to phone the elders at the church maybe do something I can't come to church but I decided I I something came to me that you are talking alone have you approached God because this thing is concerning I took off that I put on a normal I went to the service and I was fine you know sometimes it happens to you you put God aside and struggle to say now what am I going to do what should they do when things are [Applause] this but if you can turn around talk to him something will happen amen I was talking to a brother right now that even this morning when did we arrive here today yesterday yesterday oh yesterday brother I'm telling you the truth before God it has become a habit when I'm about to go to the service something happens but after I realized that it has become a habit I started to check with the word of God and I commun mes said God this people are not mine when God told him to go so he said no these people are not me so if you are not with us we won't go mes said Lord unless say brother somebody talking unless you say brother I can't hear you unless your presence go unless your presence go with us Moses was refusing to go without God he said we won't read now he said these people are your people now unless your presence with us let us remain here if we we were we could learn that if your presence not go with us mes said then let us remain here Moses meant that he can't tolerate such a situation to lead the people without God's presence okay let us all learn that God when when we go to uh to fly I always talk with God lord we will only be safe if you will be with us in the flight I don't compare this flight with the other flights but if we are in a flight and we are going like as we are coming here then we say to God God I I always tell him to be the pilot I said because I'm going to serve you I want I ask you to be my pilot because you can read of many plane crashed until you fear to fly

scripture Matthews chapter 26 from verse 26 and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take it this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins but as say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom amen amen we started by taking bread let us pray our heavenly father we come to thee knowing that Lord Lord you are our savior your own blood was shed so father is to bring your own bloodline we believe that we are the blood bloodline of the most holy God that's why you have made yourself known to us even when you sent the prophet father to come come to open the seals to the bloodline everything that you did you did through the bloodline in the Pyramid of seven churches you came through the seven churches up to the end and we are glad Lord we see that we are at the end this is the last group as brother bam says the L people to be taken up in the twinkling of an eye and we believe father as we
