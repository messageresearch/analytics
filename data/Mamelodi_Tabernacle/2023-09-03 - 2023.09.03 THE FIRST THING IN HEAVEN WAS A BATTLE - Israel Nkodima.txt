Description:
Title: The first thing in heaven was a battle
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 03/09/2023 at Mamelodi tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 12:7-12, 6:7-8, and 19:11-19 

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the battle that started in heaven and it is continuing.

The battle started in heaven then it come down to the earth and it is still continuing. As Christians our battle is happening every-day. 

When God wants to do something he must have a Man to use and Satan also uses a Man. Those who are predestined they can never serve Satan, and if you are not predestinated you can serve the devil.

Satan knows his demise and he has failed in life. His time is short and he doesn’t have eternal life. He is in a fallen state and wants to take everyone in Life. Those who don’t know God have sold their souls to Satan. 

The Pale horse rider coming against the White horse rider. 

The Pale horse rider his name is death, He knows nothing than to kill, bewitch and hell followed him (the people who believed in the pale horse rider are called hell).

The White horse his name is Faithful and True, with the name written King of Kings, Lord of Lords and is coming from heaven. Christians fears the white horse rider for his power and Wrath. 


The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

63-0321 The Fourth Seal Par 279

once babies [Music] and uh if we go out every job [Music] some other babies are coming we are just passing through not Tuesday all right now let me read you to you before I close the first thing in heaven was a battle ah you ready to read to us that yes Lucifer was kicked out and come to the Earth you know it is in the Bible then he polluted Eden edging then he is been polluting ever since he's strong just like it's just to destroy the heart is and even him maybe she or he doesn't know his demise now you must thank God who has saved you and then because the day is coming the Judgment Day is coming amen all right now we are we are reading the last things beef the first thing in heaven yeah the battle started not here and it came down to the end when Lucifer hey Lucifer who was cast on by Michael then he started to pollute him and ever since is polluting amen amen well what happened and if you are predestinated you can never self-seated [Music] because you are the chosen of God all right Jeff let me finish the first thing was the battle in heaven Lucifer was kicked out Lucifer was the right hand man amen it is like a if maybe you are ordained a deacon here and you start to Rebel you know yes just because of that is [Music] made the right hand man yeah I will read to you next time the Bible reading okay now what okay now before we continue get us that battle it has got the name [Music] Revelation chapter 12 verse 7. volume is the best thing of the day Revelation chapter 12 from verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against it thank you for standing up not for the pastors all right and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed Lord neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceivered the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the weight of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice he heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he have but a short time amen amen amen that part is a coming right amen okay you may be seated now I reach [Music] let me start again so that I can make it a property the first thing in heaven was a battle as you you have heard from the Bible and Lucifer was kicked out you know that the Angel Michael yeah and come to the Earth then he polluted just like amen then he is being polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven is coming to the battle on Earth and it is so it is to be finished more at the end time as you seen already that this is the end time [Music] Flats everywhere terrible things because the Lord predicted it shall be like the days that's what is happening right now um and uh he says it will be finished on Earth at the end time at the end time in a battle called Armageddon [Music] now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven [Music] right I mean I will leave it there for now okay we we have this sign here and brother another sign says [Music] and it is dry well it will be it's not running dry I hope it is dry amen amen and then it says it's for the way of the kings of the is [Music] where there was water now it's away how many knows that it has happened [Music] right the river is dry now I read here it says anyway one knows that the battle started in heaven and holy and so they kicked him out and Michael kicked him out and he dropped right down to Eden and then here started the battle here [Music] that's why we are different there's God and the Fallen City because since he is falling he wants to take everybody with him and the people don't understand he can use anybody who is not predestinated because a person that is predestinated amen amen cannot serve Satan but those who are not predestinated the Bible says for you are chosen before the foundation hey before the foundation before he started working on a foundation we make sure that he has made his choice people who will live together with him all right now that's why we are in this blanket flesh yeah and the Bible speaks of the works of Flesh [Music] young people they have lost the direction because of sin in this last days and the church also is being invaded by some spirits now he started in heaven and it is continued until now this is the battle called in the Bible I know we went through this but I'm finishing up something here okay let's continue for a while there's two there is one called The Pale Horse yeah yeah that is that is a horse and the White Horse now let us read this both because at the end of time we see the pilots coming against the White House [Music] okay the pillars is Revelation chapter six verse seven to eight Revelation chapter 6 verse 7-8 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto him unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the Earth right that's the pill horse he knows nothing else but just to kill him because he doesn't know where he's going a person who doesn't believe in the Lord he doesn't know where he comes from and where he's going all right now I read now that that is of the pale horse hair following followed him [Music] hell era the people who believed in they are called hell and revelation 19. 14. brother you I don't know if this Bible here whether the language will be the same yes 19. revelation 19. Revelation chapter 19. first 14. okay brother hold up hold on just days verse 14 says verse 14 Erie and where do we start here verse 11. more verse 11. and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse now that one is but yeah this one is coming from Heaven that one yeah is coming from the Earth [Music] it is just as painless the Earth and now here it says I saw heaven open and behold a white rose set upon upon him was called faithful and in righteousness he does judge and made Wars saw this white horse is challenged by this challenge yeah right in the end of time now his eyes were as flame of fire who's that and 14 verse 14 says 14 Erie and he the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses [Music] now we'll get to eat that this this Army is the people who were here and and they were raptured and that's what Revelation says revelation 12. tell us about foreign we shall come together at the end that's why I called brother rage give reason my eternal brother and brother memes our Eternal Brothers whom we shall live with finally right volume can somebody help foreign they want to hear for themselves okay Revelation 12 verse 12 therefore Rejoice he heavens and ye that dwell in them who to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he has but a short time amen yeah Satan's time is shot now foreign um he knows how terrible is his demise now let us look at this one this one let's go back it says brother read that scripture again yes the very same scripture have just read therefore Rejoice see heavens and ye that dwell in them who to the Inhibitors of the F and of the sea for the devil heaven foreign [Music] so they will there's going to be a great joy a great reunion because the Bible says he shall come in there we shall be taken up so those people are our brothers and sisters and they are there waiting for us amen that's why the things of this water we know they are temporary okay where where now now and the armies verse 14 chapter 19 chapter 19. and the armies which were in heaven so there is of the scenes but in heaven which were in heaven followed him upon white horses [Music] because he himself is riding a white horse clothes in fine Linens white and clean that is their righteousness and listen what what it says or continue brother until verse 16. verse 15 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tradeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and wrath and almighty God and he has on his vesture and on his thigh and name written king of kings and Lord of lords right and that one also has a name which is deaf his name is death and the hell followed him if the people follow Satan they are called Help they are not only going to hell but they are called hell and those who followed the Lord in heaven Hallelujah followed we have started to follow him now [Music] upon white roses clothed in fine linen white and clean [Music] I tell you some of this those people are still here [Music] they are here and out of his mouth that with each he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he said that's the one one place of the fearlessness and Wrath of almighty God [Laughter] [Music] did you hear it now we as Christians fear him for his greatness his power why especially he came to the earth when we were lost forfeited the book and then he saw which is titled it was given to Adam because now God shared with his son gave him a part in again and planted some trees amen amen he did enough for Adam okay and then after that after he was kicked out of heaven he came he saw Adam he was full with Envy because Adam Adam he thought that Adam has taken my place he went straight there quality and said Adam what did God say who who spoke is that if yeah what did God say no yeah he said you know she knew the scripture he said we can eat here and but not here um even today yeah the people they know that God said don't thou shall not steal Thou shalt not commit adulterers amen but when a man is hardened [Music] of course you can only stand against God if you are not chosen but if you are chosen of God that's why he came for you to wash you off that sin of Adam like saying it was not your fault is the first man [Music] then he took upon himself foreign that's why you look at the people uh you know the Bible says love one another but you find person loving only his flesh brothers and sisters but not another person do you call that Christianity no a Christian love loves everybody that's a Christian we still love you because that is the love of God okay now I I will finish it now the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white roses because he's riding white white horse foreign [Music] and Lord of lords that still that the king melted [Applause] when he built Abraham he was called melchized okay I read you yeah and I saw an angel standing in the sun he cried with a loud voice [Music] saying to all the vowels that fly in the midst of Heaven and gather and gather yourself together yourself together and to the supper of the great God that you may eat the Flesh of Kings the Flesh of captains that's the word of God saying this and it continues then he says and I saw the Beast all right now in order to rep it down I'm looking at this as it says it started in heaven all right I'm looking at this one here yep the weight of God says throw their mouth of his prophet Satan was cast out of Heaven into the Earth that's Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 to 9. 12 7 tonight yeah if you serve Satan we are saving a fallen angel um you will also remain in a fallen state it depends on whom do you send if you substituted he will use you like you know Satan in the Bible the time of job when the sons of God would come to God the Bible says Satan also came with them until God said now what about you then says I've I've been going down up and down all right when we come to the service what he comes there is a woman um we used to talk when I was I will take things foreign [Music] our pasta says one day he had a dream chairman and again and sing Satan right in the church hey yeah until then and so forth yeah the pastor says until one day he approached him and he said what about you what puts you here life come true [Music] they're also inside Linda okay okay I also have my time to say piano thank God he says it's like that yes yes it is just like that when the sons of God come together he also comes what with his place for Destruction he's a man on the Run he has failed in life now he wants to take everybody with him but the people don't know they follow him they worship him they don't know that that man knows his demise he doesn't want to go alone [Music] they say that's how he thinks he can disappoint God that's why you see the people today many people they have sold their souls the souls are inside in sales [Music] selling it to Satan the people who do not know God only a person who doesn't know God can sell his soul and the ones you sell your soul that's the end of you hello what a terrible thing you know I have noticed that the people don't know what is hell they could know what the hell is like but now the Bible says Satan has blinded them as long as he's alive he doesn't care about God but yet we come and go I mean you know there's a cemetery there [Music] is a scrap yard today indicating to you that Elijah nothing is forever both the driver and his car yeah there's no car that has eternal life it's only men because God 's Mercy brought you out amen by his blood did you know that the kids man maybe let's understand it today [Music] he speaks of the king's menopause right amen and you know I think we were in Tanzania where's that brother all right do you know that Christ is a family man [Music] why he came to shed his blood because that was Redemption for his family [Applause] like sometimes the people if somebody is sick and he will go and offer maybe an organ if they say one of the organs [Music] because she is King to that one [Applause] now God the Lord Jesus Christ that's why God by his wisdom and love he also took the same the body of Flesh so for him to wash us off that is in the flesh amen and we call they called him Jesus the Savior amen amen so I read so wonderful that the brother in Port Elizabeth just believe the God not the pastor but God amen amen you are struck by stroke is true and the mouth twisted like then when I mentioned sister Hadith he believed that and the mouth [Applause] all right amen he was healed by his faith in the way and I've seen many others why I quote brother gay person I believe that it is because of his [Music] you know when the floods came Noah that's right God has always moved the way to save his children believe me that this morning I couldn't even use this leg properly I was saying in my heart I'm going to serve God [Applause] is God and why what she has said he will do that if he says by his stripes we were healed now I believe to this morning that by history [Applause] and I said Satan get out of the way I'm going to serve God [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's a disappointed man now right Now you listen here before he closes verse 15 says verse 15 Erie and out of his mouth goeth a sharp shot that with it he should as might the Nations and he shall rule them with or yes okay sorry let me wait for you amen amen and he has on his sister and on his thigh a name written foreign [Music] and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourselves together and to the supper of the great God the flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains and so forth okay now in order for me to finish yeah I will turn to another scripture false of heaven will be someone to come they're fowls for a feast foreign talking about the uh Satan how at first he was cast out of heaven [Music] but Revelation 12 if you you come down again the very same Satan who has cursed out now after all it said Satan is cast down mufas Out of Heaven he was casted down to the Earth he is being ruling amen ities [Music] he also has the pilots [Music] all right I won I went to Austin Texas when we were passing a brother said to him you know here there was a mama foreign then he says now the people started together around here [Music] she took that much and some other articles and just push them undone amen and they went away Isaiah one time saw Satan sprawling on the ground it and he said God because if a person hears the word of God and he rejects that means he thinks he know better than God [Music] he was flooded by such thoughts and God since that time if God starts a church he also wants to start a church amen some of them are from the water a church from the water foreign the Bible says the fire that is coming you know I fit brother Branham expressing this that fire that is coming is going to bend even the water [Applause] that's the fire of God is going to burn water that's why Revelation chapter 21 says there was no more see [Applause] oh yeah no more hiding place revelation saying today Inhibitors of the Earth [Music] because Revelation chapter 13. tells us that [Music] he says I saw a beast coming out of the city so there is some in the sea have you ever initiated [Music] who can stand up and say yes whoa [Applause] sorry but now you are safety again I'm telling you hey we are no longer a sinner outside because the Lord Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ there's a terrible day that is coming very soon look at the science now the floods all over the world sometimes if you wake up in the morning and you see the news what things that are happening then you say Lord I'm so glad you have blessed us so much amen amen that we haven't yet experienced such floods why God why it is happening like that Abraham said what if you find maybe two three [Music] I could find them then I would not destroyed [Music] can just buy it he will not destroy because of his children is that right yes it is like that in the Bible God can say because of one person because the soul of men [Music] is so precious before God if you could know that when God comes to visit or when he created you amen amen when he created he said let us make men Serena image so that's why man was made in the image of God but men decided to teach God and serve another God it's a series we will continue because we are on the runway [Music] the Lord willing we will rush to Tanzania Tanzania the pastor there has asked me to come there and finish my sermon on melchized foreign as soon as I have he is just for a few days how many days how many days for how many days then I will stop here according to the time here just pray for me we are we are running towards [Music] no the world is running towards the tribulations you will see how terrible is gonna it is gonna be foreign but while time allows you give your life to Jesus Christ [Applause] Surrender Your Life to the Lord Jesus Christ I didn't say to church I said the Lord Jesus Christ okay amen and he will save you and that day when it the day comes will be found in his favor in his hands amen amen that's why it let us be glad and rejoice and
