Description:
Title: Accessing The Right To The Tree Of Life
Preached by Elder Neo Makgaseetsa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 25 August 2024

Genesis 3:24 | Ezekiel 28:13 | Hebrews 4:12 | 

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about having access to the tree of life.

We need to check how we can have access to the tree of life because for many years we did not have access. Since Adam and Eve where chased out of the garden we see the cherubim’s having the sword to guard the way of the tree of life.

The flaming sword was preventing Adam and Eve to go to the tree of life, because they partook from the tree of knowledge. Since then man has been running away from the presence of God. When you leave the ground you need to go to the apex. 

If the word of God does not pull you then there’s a problem with you. God has always been after a man. Because man cannot save himself. You are a sheep that needs a great shepherd to go after you and bring you back. 
During the dispensation of David in Israel he was killing in order to reign. But during the time of Solomon there was never a war because it was a different dispensation. During Solomon's time was time for millennium, it was time to enjoy the benefit of what David fought for. 

During the time of Solomon, he reigned without any war. Solomon reigned with wisdom and everyone came to Jerusalem to see the wisdom of Solomon. You look at Moses, David, Joshua and Solomon all that they lived for you find that character in the Lord Jesus. Jesus was the main character.

Adam was supposed to stay in Eden for a thousand years but he failed. God loved David and honoured him with something that will stand for a thousand years. During the time of Solomon, the was no war in Israel and in the millennium there will be no war. Even the devil will be bound with the chain of circumstances.

Jesus didn’t have the sword of the king because he was the king, because the king and the sword are one. Jesus was the tree of life that was rejected.

name of the Lord Jesus Christ as your word is going to be preached oh God we say Lord re heavenly father and we bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen this morning we will read from the the Bible in the Book of Genesis chapter 3 only verse 24 that will be our first scripture the last scripture will be the when you see us reading Revelation is when we close amen amen Genesis 3: 24 so he drove out the men and he placed at the east of the G Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sord which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen amen you may be seated I think I gave you the resolution for the day that when we read Genesis will be closing amen amen as H you know another old man was asking one of the preachers one of the mighty preachers he asked him a question and say when you how do we know that you are coming to the end of your seron and the preacher said when I'm sending behind the pulpit I will preach and go on and on when I start to feel my feet becoming hot I know I must stop hey the feet were not going hot they were forever cold and the old man was we need to have a prayer for his feet to become because the service is going on and on so this morning when I read the book of Revelation you know we about to close amen amen so that is the uh conclusion of our today message we want to thank God for everything we want to thank God for everything you are being this morning the was on the other side of limo in we thank God for everything God has did that side this morning we'll be listening to the word of God as well uh I just want to tell you again this morning pray for our brothers in L went that side the children of God from masu moru and mor they are now having services in the place called so I've heard that they came in numbers the people around the village so keep them in their prayers God is doing a wonderful job that side amen amen so this morning I I want to share with you about this title accessing the right to the tree of life amen because for many years you're quite right amen for many years we were not allowed to go back there but we need to check how we can have that access because since then Adam and Eve were chased out of the Garden of Eden and we see the Sal the Flaming Sal closing the gate to the tree of life that's my introduction that's my resolution so I'm going to present this message in this morning as uh like a novel how they write a novel they will tell you about the exposition and then they will tell you about the ascending action they will tell you about the Apex being the climax and then you will go to the descending action until you get to the resolution so our you know Exposition scripture is the one we just read the Resolute one will be the Book of Revelation and then we close the service I'm going to be very much brief straight to the point let's just go together amen amen well I'm going to read a quote from Brother Bram he was praying he even said let's bow our head everywhere and pray this spoken way in this spoken word I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision then let me read brother Bram says father who brought again the Lord Jesus Christ to life though old world seems to be modernistic and they are going they're going lot they are going l h to knowledge in instead of just a simple faith in God we realize that in the gardien of Eden when they tasted the tree of knowledge they broke of relationship with the tree of life since then man has went after knowledge and Destroy himself every time he bites from the tree the gun Powers the gun oh the G gunpowder situn ohun Auto the auto and now an atomic bomb knowledge and the knowledge truly the Prophet Daniel said they will run to and through and the knowledge shall increase God put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and in the Garden of Eden they have a control over everything now when they have a control over everything the devil came there as well and deceive Eve he deceive Eve and God said I will never keep you in this Garden anymore I have to take you out then he take them out of the garden of when they were out there when they look back realized that they cannot go back because there was a flaming Sal and that flaming Sal was preventing them to go back to the tree of life because they partt on the tree of knowledge amen amen now from that time A man was running because he he left the presence of God and from that time God said I need to restore this man back to the tree of where a man has a control over everything that is the beginning is the Resolute then you need we need to go up a little bit on the ascending action because we need to get somewhere When I Was preparing the message I was thinking when the disc thinking when the disc was preaching the previous week about the Zenit point when you leave from the ground you need to go to the Apex the Apex there is the Zen point is where the whole interest is in amen amen when when you write a book that is why they are editors they are moderators you know they even scrutinize your script are you on the right path or not and advise you to Omit some because they were not relevant because your story when you start it it need to go up it need to go up and when you are up there you start to understand what was the story all about and when you are up there you cannot forever going up you need to come down and when you come down the people start to understand what you are trying to say and when you come to the conclusion of your story you now understand that is why some of the stories for you to understand you must read them twice orce then you understand but you read it once you may not understand you are still surprised or maybe you're looking at the movie this person is he going to be killed is he going to be survived all those things they taking you somewhere you even cross your feet and wanting to know what will happen what is the next move that is why the devil is so cunning if he can hold you on the so so so you you will even not com to church oh so oh [Music] so Days of Our Lives Days of Our Lives when it comes to an end for that day you want to know what will happen tomorrow and they give you a question mark for you to go on when you look you have been after that story for 5 years it will always keep you on a s even when the preacher preaches something you want to see that's how the novelist write their that's how the soers things you so I'm I'm presenting this word of God for you to be pulled in order tomorrow you want to hear more the other day you want to hear more the next day you are in heaven that's what happens to Enoch amen you know it happens to Enoch he he he lived the word of God a day out on the last day he was in heaven in death if the word of God does not pull you there's a problem with that way there's a problem in you but if the word of God is real it will pull you day in day out until you see your own purpose amen amen so here things started now God started his way of redemption of healer of Amen because what happened in the garden ofen we blame no one but accept the will of God remember God Is A Healer it's a redeemer it's a Savor for him to do this someone must fall upon his falling he must redeem him someone must be sick on your sick bed he must heal you because he's a Healer so there's nothing wrong or nothing you can blame in the Garden of Eden it was the will of God from that time A man was running from the presence of God and God going after you Adam where are you amen am Moses come here God was always after a human being you can not save yourself you are just a sheep you need the great Shepherd to go after you and bring you back to your original position because our position was in the Garden of Eden we need to go there we need to have access there but this morning I will show you how we we must get the access there but for us to get there let's take this journey let's go up a little bit we see the Flaming sword stopping them from going back I just chose one character in the Old Testament but there are too many because I need you to go with me right to the you know Apex right to the you know because that's where things are happen I chose David because I love him so much amen amen you know King David when before he became a king he just has a string and a stone but God put him in the Kingdom in Israel in the Royal house and he gave him a sword David was was killing left and right using that sword and no one in his entire life defe him no one until he was on his death bed when he look back he could simply say I have killed many I have stood for the word of God I really used the king's sword because the sword of David was the sword of the king until he laid down and give it to Solomon when he gave it to Solomon he said to Solomon this sword need to be used amen amen but in time of Solomon was another dispens not the dispensation of killing was was not the the time of killing but it was the time of enjoying whatav did amen it was the time of Millennium did you hear the story of Solomon when he was a king in Israel he never went out for he asked God to give him wisdom when he was reigning he was reing with wisdom it was peace in Israel the read know that the readers they know that there was never time of Peace in Israel except the time of Solomon amen David was killing was fighting left and right for Solomon to benefit benefit amen amen when he became a king God made it precise to him you are not your father or like unto your father he was a man who stood for his purpose but you I have another purpose for you to ra without killing until the entire world wanted to know what is happening there in during the time of Solomon all over the world they were going to Israel to know the wisdom that Solomon had amen then we we go a bit higher so you see Solomon was different to David amen but they were two greatest King amen amen as I normally say we can all be the children of God but we are not the same God has given us different kind of characters we cannot we can all be deacons but the approach of the matter not the same does not make one a sinner or not message the same like you but different King gift among ourselves amen amen so you see David hand over to Solomon and we are still going up when we get up there right at the top right there on the climate we see our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you know our Lord Jesus Christ is one man who was not like others have you ever asked yourself Jesus Christ was a young man but look at the character of Abraham how he did things you find that thing in Jesus look at David the way he lived for many years but his character is Right In Jesus you look at Solomon all the wisdom all what he has Jesus so Jesus Christ is the main [Applause] character [Applause] you you look at Enoch what he he lived for you find it in Jesus you look at Moses you look at Joshua all what they live there were all in one man Jesus what kind of a man you amen amen let me read here again the unveiling of God Amen paragraph 197 says a type way back when David was leaving the temple rejected King went down through the street and an old a little old crippled up fellow crawling along never did like he he called him old hypocrite or something spit right in his face and that c pulled the sword and say I let that dog's head stay on him speit on him on my king amen amen David said let him alone God told him that told David you know the nature of David was to kill you disagree with him your family will bury you that's David but God came and tell him this one don't kill let them to fool against you there's a reason that you cannot see now but you will know it later and David probably he didn't know what he said went up the mountain looking looking back and crying that was King David nature was different amen am but God said leave it like that let them make you food because there's a reason it was a time of Jesus Christ because 00 years the son of David was climbing the same Mountain looking out weeping over Jerusalem rejected King and they speak in his face took his so cut somebody's ear Jesus took it back you know this bodyguard of David took his soul wanted to kill that person but David said to him don't do it that time of David we was we see it exactly at our Lord Jesus Christ 800 years later same you know a God the way he loved David honored him for something that will stand for a thousand years Adam was supposed to stay in Eden for a thousand years but he couldn't and then after they partt from the Tree of knowledge he took them out for a reason but in the time of Solomon the son of David God respected David and said to him you will not build a temple but your son will and Solomon became the type of Jesus Christ because during his time there was no war in Israel during the time of Jesus Christ when he will be ruling in the Millennium will be no war the Bible says even the devil will be bound with a chain of circumstance he will deceive no if he deceived the first if but the last one will never be [Applause] deceived amen amen now we are in the Apex up there when we are there looking at our Lord Jesus Christ as individual and look back from where we started from the exposition from the ascending action we see we start to realize that those lives that children of God live in those times it was the Shad of this real one man and Jesus Christ was God himself they were living for God until up there we start to realize oh the old when all were coming when they were going up and then we see what they live for that is why Jesus said to them Abraham so my days he was so happy oh Abraham lived for this David live for this man because all their characters when you combine them they just give you the life of Jesus Christ as an individual Jesus is the father of the nation Jesus he raptured Jesus didn't have the sword of the king but he is the king and the king and the sword is one Jesus is the Tree of Life [Applause] the tree they rejected in the Garden of Eden Jesus amen amen amen I read investment paragraph 250 the man of God says and that great tree that great tree of life when he come on Earth they chopped it down by a Roman spear on a Roman Tree cruel cast tree but in there he redeemed a Bright Tree the bright tree one just like him that Eve tree from the Garden of Eden the tree that had fallen if in the beginning and Adam walked out with him now come now now Adam comes with and the second Adam knowing what he has he had his eyes open to come to receive his amen amen the Bible talks about the first Adam and the second ad it talks about the first Eve and the second Eve the Adam that can fail the if that can fa but the second ad was the quick in spirit he cannot fall and the second Eve being the Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ that cannot fall amen amen so when you look at the entire life of Jesus Christ you will truly believe there Old Testament was the Shad of the New Testament and if our Lord Jesus Christ up there I don't know if maybe they can flesh what I've asked the team to you know so that we go together amen amen we start to realize that the Old Testament in action going up when he going up right on top is our lord Jesus CHR then they started to understand even us looking from far we start to realize something but it mustn't add there so what's next amen amen from up there we need to go down when we get down we need to have access of life when when we when you read here let's read uh the Bible here in the Book of Ezekiel yeah amen amen chapter 28 ver 28 verse 18 verse uh 13 13 oh 13 Ezekiel 28 verse3 thou H has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the sadas topas and the diamond the barel the onx and the Jasper the safer the emerald and the cab cabac and gold the workmanship of thy tbrad and thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created verse 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover and I have said the soul thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire amen amen you know there in the Garden of Eden Satan was there as well you hear what the Bible says th has been in the Eden the Garden of God amen amen he was there and when God is doing something he was looking but not looking with a good eye to comply he was looking in a way that can do like him the way he doing some something I can you know overshine him that was Adam I mean Satan and God was looking in his heart when he look in his heart he see all those evil as I was saying you you cannot be killed or sabotaged by an unknown person the person close to you can do whatever he want life it's always the cases you look even on the natural those that were assassinated were the people that were close to you and then they deal with you they know what you like they know where you are what time they know what you eat they know what you drink they know what you what time you go to church and they are looking at you and they want to make sure 100% the day they assassinate you just a minute so these things never started here they started back there when this Cher stud God and then he wanted to overshine even today is still happening because history repeat itself it's just a spirit going from age to ages from age to ages that is why with David his own son did the same thing it's it's natural and it's something that you cannot stop even if you can pray you won't stop that thing even if you fast you won't stop that thing there it's natural it should happen to show the power of God God has just allowed these things so that you can know that he is God amen amen so this man J was right on top them showing the whole world that he is God he is the creator of Heaven and Earth but he doesn't stop there he must go further the only way to go further to come amen amen now we go to the descending Ed when we go to the descending we we we meet a man by the name of Paul we we meet a man like amen Amen on my draft here I just said Paul and Timothy being the pastor of the church that time then these two men they were all together and when Paul was there he was always said to Timothy my spiritual son follow me do like me as I do like Christ if you have question just follow me one of the days you will get the answer of the questions you had when you did not understand me I wish the church this morning I wish the church this morning hear me out there are certain things you do not understand just follow one of the days you will understand life is about stages amen amen we've got teachers here the primary teachers a child can come to you and say the reason why I did not come to school yesterday our stomach ache or head ache he won't say depression you say anxiety no headache or stomach that's all then that's a primary child primary sickness amen if a primary child can say teacher I did not come to school because I had anxiety it's not the nature of their sickness then as a teacher you just say my child you you'll get well don't worry after school he say no no no you didn't the teacher knows that's how far you can go he knows very well that you are lying there saying I'm I'm to the teacher then the teacher will smile and knowing that one of the days when you are a teacher you will understand there are certain things you cannot carry but when you are grown up you can be able to carry but if you cannot carry don't ague with the word that are ahead of you that knows better just say Lord help me to continue the journey one of the days I will see better I will understand better then I will know you better then you are done don't try to trick people if you can lie to the pastor yeah it's always the case amen so when I chose Paul and Peter it's for a reason because I've realized something if you can read in Hebrews chap 4:12 you understand what I'm talking about Hebrews 4:12 amen for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aand of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a deser of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen amen you see here it's Paul who says this the word of God is so quick and Powerful you know and and sharper than any two-edged s is how far Paul can go that s he liken it unto the word of God because God has revealed it unto him and he said to the in the Hebrew the word of God is like this that's how far I can teach as we are descending to the resolution when you descend to the resolution you start to realize start to understand what happen on the descending what happened to the Apex What happened to the I mean to the going up what happened to the exposition for you to understand the book you must read it until to the end that's where you get answers for the questions you had on the previous entire book amen amen so the last Church age there the answers for all the request the seventh seal has to reveal other seals other that are left behind the seventh men messenger has to explain who is the first to the SI they were just living their life a very good life before the God but the seventh one is the one that put everything in position that s was always going ages and ages ages and ages Paul just teach about it he haven't touched it it was just going on the people and believed at the time of the resolution we need to have answers you have answers in the Gap brother Bram says then in that morning was just sitting relaxing with his family and then God said to him hey go where are you going I got no just go when you went he go up the mountain there in Sab that morning praying and wondering what could happen because God just say go like what he did to Abraham Abraham go to the mountain I will give you a sacrifice you know when you follow God you just go you just follow and the best you can do just follow by following you become the beneficial what will happen hold my hands out to God out on top of that mountain the Sal Dro into my hand with a pale handle got all over got over it a it's a s in this cover a Long Blade about 3T long at least like a PO metal or like a chrome a razor Shar and I didn't know what it was and I said I'm afraid of these things and just then a voice spoke and shook the Canon and said this is the sword of the [Applause] Lord and the sword of the Lord is the word of the Lord the word of God is Shar than two edges now when you are there with brother B you start to have the answer oh Paul never handled the swords he was talking about now brother bran in his head you start to go back oh Adam was out of Eden Eden with his wife Eve a flaming sword was there so no one access the area now the very same sword is now in their hand of [Applause] brother then he was looking at it and realized this if this is the sword of the key is the very same sword is the very same soul that David had is the very same soul that blocked the way to the tree of life it tells you now you start to understand you start to smile oh now I understand if the S take them out now the S take them amen amen this is the only message that they can take us back to the Garden of Eden because we have the sord of the king so brother was like e things were happening now when you are standing there looking at this story looking at this trama you know reading you now start to read with understanding as say if you read the scripture you don't see Christ you read the scripture you don't see yourself read it again when you read it again you start to see yourself this man of God Elijah one of the days he said to this young man go there and tell me what you see he went once fries until sixth time the seventh time he said I just see a small Cloud when he see the small Cloud he started to say now is the time be ready tell ah to be ready as well because the rain is coming but initially nothing was there nothing was happening if nothing is happening God was always waiting for the seven time for the seventh messenger for the seventh SE to show you everything we we have answers brother if you do not have an answer wait until God give you an answer we we know where we coming from we know where we are we know where we are going because the sword of the King was right in the hands of brother listen to him again he said oh I held it up in my hand like this I said a king amen amen and I looked around and the S was gone I said the king saw I've seen it I've handled it and the voice came spoke to me again and said Kings s not the small King but the king with a letter it was the sword of the king in my hand Hallelujah when you are there being the Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ if you look at my Dr I said brother Bram and the bride because what brother Bram has it become what the bride will [Music] benefit amen amen when you look for the king sword now with the bride if you need the way to heaven the bride amen amen when I was with the pastor I was giving him the report from L then I said pastor I'm surprised something is happening this time we no longer evangelized like before and have t and everything I still see the children of God coming and got baptized without being testified for then I give him an example I said I was driving from work when I was driving from work I passed the area where one of the brothers stay they were waiting for me on the road then when I see them and they see me they stop my car then I pull over and greet them day it was nice then brother is brother he introduced me to this man and said for a moment so then I was happy then I there after I said no we'll come and continue because my brother is going to work I just knock off will come and EXP more about the word of God I don't want explanation I'm going home when I come back I want you to bapti me we never open the Bible then I said how did you he says saw that's how God is calling us today we don't the tent and evangelized brought from the Garden of Eden he was always after a human being he was always after us he found us there was never a time where we were looking for him but he was forever looking for us that is why today he said if you don't want to worship me I will raise the stone and they will worship me if you don't want to listen to me this donkey will top because a donkey saw the angel of God and stop that the man cannot see seeing an Angel and even to now what have I done a donkey to see what I seeing see looking at an angel with a flame in s you cross here I tear you into pieces amen that's how it happens today amen amen we him last year this the way he is the Bible talks always talks of and them when looking at you I see like you are one of those he a man of big structure he's a giant and then this man got baptized because of you know so next maybe this week or next week when he come back from you will see him will baptize because he said so that's how God do things in this we are no longer preaching we are living a life that th people to the word of God by so doing ah we have reached our destination we are in a situation of point point of no return I like it when our pastor was teaching us about the runway when you are in the flight is on the Run way it doesn't have reverse we are not going back what never but what we go this time if you don't want to leave the word of God God is doing it in other children of God this time we are living in you read the last chapter of the Bible says if you don't want to believe it's okay if you don't want to be holy it's okay the time of us showing colors but what I can tell you the resolution that with the sword of the king it was the only sword that can take us back to the Garden of Eden when you look at the whole thing that kind of the pyramid it gives gives you a cycle the cycle of Eternity when you when you look at the resolution and looking at the exposition and looking at the Apex is just one thing a cycle of Eternity for who was on the exposition who was in the ging of eating was Lord Jesus Christ being the Tree of Life when look at the Apex there it's Lord Jesus Christ when you look at the resolution at the end of things it's Lord Jesus Christ it's just him in the cyle you know you know you know you know living in us guing us hallelujah I I I had a sharing yesterday with the brother from they just make a what conference call in that conference call there was nothing to discuss was just to share about the word of God when we were sharing about the word of God we were all because we talking only the positive because there are other people when you visit them you come back set because the only thing they can produce is bitterness this is the the time for you to show who you are and I said to the brothers we're just talking if you do not have anything to say about a child of God the prophet says keep quiet the moment you open your mouth say something good say something positive something comfortable say something encouraging if you do not such keep quiet that's what my Prophet is teaching me you know if we can start gossiping if we can start gossiping talk bad about ourselves this church will be empty but if we can start talking nice about one another encouraging one another comforting one another Heaven is here we are Heavenly [Applause] power amen amen so when you look at the life of Paul it takes you back to the Apex when you look at the life of Timothy it takes you back to the Apex when you take the life of brother Bram takes you back to the Apex because brother br will not do anything until the King has spoken cannot do anything until the King has spoken the Old Testament was reflecting here the New Testament was reflecting him we are reflecting him not in the Old Testament not in the New Testament at the back amen we are living beyond the church ages beyond the church ages brother says is the bright age we are living in the bright ageia came to an end we are no longer there we are above in we meet him the one that is on the AP the one the Holy Ghost he came down as going up then we meet at the end you see no difference between Lord Jesus Christ because brother says we are him when you want to see Lord Jesus Christ you look at us God whom you worship you saying is in heaven now is in Earth Jesus was teaching them how to pray and he said to them when you pray you must say our father who are in heaven but that father that was in Heaven is now in earth when we pray we can say it for the sake of saying it you can say our our heaven father our father
