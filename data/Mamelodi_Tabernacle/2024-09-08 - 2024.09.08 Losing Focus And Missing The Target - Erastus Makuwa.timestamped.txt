[49:25] scripture for the
[49:28] children Mark 10:
[49:32] 13-6 and they brought young children to
[49:35] him that he should touch them and his
[49:38] disciples rebuked those that brought
[49:40] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[49:43] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[49:46] little children to come unto me and
[49:48] forbid them not for of such is the
[49:51] kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[49:54] whosoever shall not receive the kingom
[49:56] om of God as a little child he shall not
[49:59] enter therein and he took them up in his
[50:02] arms put his hands upon them and bless

[50:08] [Music]
[50:10] seats they brought them children unto
[50:14] him so that he can touch
[50:18] them they touch the
[50:22] want it was not the outdoor touch
[50:27] they wanted the
[50:30] inward they wanted the life of these
[50:33] children to be
[50:37] changed they know that if that man can
[50:40] touch
[50:42] them these children's lives will be
[50:47] changed to get the
[50:50] children to guide
[50:53] them they can try to guide them
[50:57] to protect the
[50:58] children they can try to protect
[51:01] them but the problem is the
[51:05] inside that is what they want him to
[51:11] touch because if he can touch
[51:15] them something will
[51:18] happen I am here

[1:01:09] 33 22 to 33 or 32 to
[1:01:13] 33 and straight way Jesus constrained
[1:01:16] his disciples to get into a ship and to
[1:01:20] go before him unto the other side while
[1:01:24] he sent the multitude away
[1:01:26] and when he had sent the multitude away
[1:01:29] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[1:01:32] and when the evening was come he was
[1:01:35] there alone but the ship was now in the
[1:01:38] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[1:01:41] the wind was contrary and in the Fourth
[1:01:44] Watch of the night Jesus went unto them
[1:01:47] walking on the sea and when the
[1:01:49] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[1:01:51] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[1:01:55] and they cried out for fear but straight
[1:01:57] way Jesus spake unto them saying be of
[1:02:00] good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and
[1:02:04] Peter answered him said Lord if it be
[1:02:07] thou beat me come unto thee on the water
[1:02:11] and he said come and when Peter was come
[1:02:14] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:02:16] water to go to Jesus but now he saw the
[1:02:22] wind be stros he was afraid and
[1:02:26] beginning to sink he cried saying Lord
[1:02:28] save me and immediately Jesus stretched
[1:02:31] forth his hand and caught him and said
[1:02:34] unto him oh thou of little faith
[1:02:37] wherefore did thou doubt and when they
[1:02:41] were come into a ship the wind ceased
[1:02:45] then they that were in the ship came and
[1:02:48] worshiped him saying of a truth thou are
[1:02:51] the Son of God Amen let us pray
[1:02:55] our de father thank
[1:02:58] you for this
[1:03:01] privilege you have privileged me

[1:03:06] humbly we are coming before thee with my
[1:03:09] brother
[1:03:11] here we have got
[1:03:15] voice The Voice we are given by you yes
[1:03:20] we have read the scripture here standing
[1:03:23] in front of your church CH standing in
[1:03:27] front of
[1:03:29] bride you are the only one who can talk
[1:03:32] to
[1:03:34] them use our
[1:03:37] voice to deliver your message to

[1:03:54] book of First
[1:04:01] Corinthians
[1:04:03] 13 13 10 to 11 10
[1:04:09] 11 but when that which is perfect is
[1:04:12] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:04:15] done
[1:04:16] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:04:19] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:04:22] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:04:25] away childish
[1:04:27] things God bless you
[1:04:30] amen my topic will be losing
[1:04:40] focus and missing the
[1:04:50] target brother Bram says in this book
[1:04:53] here
[1:04:56] he says tonight we are going to try to
[1:04:59] take the word of
[1:05:03] God by the power of the Holy
[1:05:07] Spirit to blow all the
[1:05:15] indifferences and DS away from
[1:05:20] us all those little light fluffy things
[1:05:28] that just doesn't have any
[1:05:33] foundation doesn't have any weight in
[1:05:36] our
[1:05:38] life we want to blow it all
[1:05:43] away so we can find this glorious vein
[1:05:58] that vein is
[1:06:05] Christ he says in this
[1:06:09] book
[1:06:12] Luke he says that is what the church
[1:06:15] should
[1:06:18] do that is what each member of the
[1:06:20] church should
[1:06:24] do would focus out of all
[1:06:33] doubts look only to the
[1:06:38] way it promised
[1:06:41] it God said
[1:06:43] so is good to be that
[1:06:49] way
[1:06:51] amen Focus
[1:06:56] to the
[1:06:59] weight what can cause one to lose
[1:07:07] focus I'm going to tell
[1:07:09] you if I can find what they want to
[1:07:16] find what cause somebody to lose
[1:07:23] focus brother says here in this
[1:07:29] book Seven Church ages seven Church
[1:07:33] ages he
[1:07:35] says to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:07:38] to sit with me in my
[1:07:44] Throne as I also
[1:07:47] overcame and am and am sat down with my
[1:07:52] father in his throne
[1:07:55] now what are we to
[1:07:58] overcome that is normal
[1:08:01] question to ask
[1:08:04] here but that is not the actual thought
[1:08:08] of this
[1:08:12] verse for it is not so much what we are
[1:08:17] to
[1:08:21] overcome but how we are to overcome
[1:08:27] now this is
[1:08:31] logical for th it matter
[1:08:35] much what we are to
[1:08:38] overcome as long as we know how we can
[1:08:45] overcome a quick look at those
[1:08:49] scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus
[1:08:54] Christ over
[1:08:55] coming will bring out the truth of this
[1:09:01] proposition in matth chapter
[1:09:04] 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the
[1:09:08] devil he came he overcame the personal
[1:09:16] Temptation Of Satan by the
[1:09:20] word by the word only
[1:09:25] each of the three major
[1:09:30] trials that corresponded exactly to the
[1:09:33] Temptation Of The Garden of
[1:09:40] Eden I've said what can cause one to
[1:09:43] lose
[1:09:47] focus and miss the
[1:09:50] target these are the
[1:09:54] following the lust of the
[1:09:57] flesh the lust of the
[1:10:01] AR the pride of
[1:10:05] life these three
[1:10:08] things are the things which can cause
[1:10:12] man to lose
[1:10:15] focus and miss the
[1:10:20] target I'm going to put some examples
[1:10:25] of people who lost
[1:10:28] focus and missed the
[1:10:32] T but let me and let me continue reading
[1:10:36] this Jesus overcome by the
[1:10:40] word he fell to personal Temptation Of
[1:10:47] Satan by failing to use the way
[1:10:56] are you
[1:10:59] together there is brother BR talks about
[1:11:02] a brother
[1:11:05] here he say Brother
[1:11:08] Boer this

[1:11:29] that and when he was in that
[1:11:35] competition he he he said they were
[1:11:41] sure that they're going to win that
[1:11:45] competition there was a certain
[1:11:49] boy they thought he wouldn't be in a
[1:11:53] picture
[1:11:56] because he was too
[1:11:59] weak for that
[1:12:02] competition but H he said the the
[1:12:05] competition was to to ride on a plain
[1:12:16] wood at 2 me
[1:12:20] above above the
[1:12:23] Earth and they said he said they all
[1:12:28] tried to ride those
[1:12:33] bicyle on that
[1:12:35] dud he said there was one little
[1:12:38] boy
[1:12:40] there we never would fellowship with
[1:12:44] him he didn't look like he know too
[1:12:48] much so we thought we were just little
[1:12:51] better than than that he was
[1:12:57] you know every one of us fell off that
[1:13:04] board but
[1:13:06] him he said he wrote it right out to the
[1:13:12] end and got off and bowed and pick up
[1:13:16] the sh
[1:13:19] bicycle because the price was a
[1:13:23] bicycle price

[1:14:17] nervous and you fell off he said when I
[1:14:21] got on
[1:14:22] there when they push me
[1:14:26] I just kept watching the end of the
[1:14:33] road I didn't look every
[1:14:37] side the last of the the last the last
[1:14:41] of the
[1:14:44] eye he overcome
[1:14:47] it he look straight at the
[1:14:53] end he said the that is how I manag to
[1:14:57] to to to
[1:15:02] pass is what the man of God say
[1:15:04] something
[1:15:07] yeah he says it doesn't matter how you
[1:15:11] could you could work or pray or
[1:15:19] whatever let me read something for you

[1:15:28] C who is doing that
[1:15:30] thing he says
[1:15:33] yeah you say well brother BR brother I
[1:15:37] have thought I had to do this and I had
[1:15:40] to do
[1:15:43] that such a difference in
[1:15:48] it in what you have to do and what you
[1:15:51] want to do
[1:15:55] you are safe not because you have done
[1:15:58] one thing to do with
[1:16:03] it you are Sav because that God saved
[1:16:06] you before the foundation of the
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] world you don't have to look
[1:16:16] down look forward to
[1:16:19] Christ don't
[1:16:22] try give it to God
[1:16:25] are you together with us don't try to do
[1:16:29] this and
[1:16:31] that but look took it unto the
[1:16:35] Lord those who try this and
[1:16:38] that they have
[1:16:41] failed but those who have given it unto
[1:16:44] the
[1:16:45] Lord they have Manish they have
[1:16:49] manag let me read something for you
[1:16:52] here the prophet says that is why some
[1:16:55] people can believe
[1:16:58] it some can't believe it some try to
[1:17:02] make believe
[1:17:06] it in ordinance of people PR line comes
[1:17:14] through they were all good
[1:17:17] people there some that try hard to
[1:17:20] believe
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] it try to work themselves into
[1:17:27] it some just can't do it at
[1:17:31] all and others just by
[1:17:35] Grace is just given to
[1:17:37] them you see this
[1:17:40] boy he was not
[1:17:43] qualified he knew that he could not ride
[1:17:46] the
[1:17:48] Bic but he had
[1:17:51] Fai he looked
[1:17:53] forward he WR the
[1:17:57] B looking forward but there are others
[1:18:01] who tried
[1:18:03] hard you see in life we've got people
[1:18:05] who
[1:18:09] impersonate they impersonate
[1:18:11] others they try to be
[1:18:16] Believers while they are
[1:18:19] not they try to please other people
[1:18:25] but they they are not
[1:18:27] Christians the Bible says we have got
[1:18:31] some who are humble
[1:18:35] people who are placing their faith in
[1:18:39] God they say if
[1:18:42] God can help me I will do this and do
[1:18:47] this but there others who are looking at
[1:18:52] others they're looking at the failures
[1:18:54] of others
[1:18:57] but they are as
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] themselves let me read
[1:19:06] something he says I would like to take
[1:19:10] little test out of
[1:19:12] here his unfailing Word of
[1:19:16] Promise our faith is based right here on
[1:19:19] the unfailing word of prise
[1:19:26] through
[1:19:28] ages has trusted in
[1:19:31] this in the promises of God now if you
[1:19:35] ever in your
[1:19:36] life ever come into the healing
[1:19:39] service and wanted to be pay all the
[1:19:42] attention to what you
[1:19:47] could I want you to do it now we want to
[1:19:52] see the Lord glorified
[1:19:56] I truly believe that every word of
[1:19:58] God every promise that he
[1:20:02] made true and it is to anybody who will
[1:20:07] accept and now there is some who try to
[1:20:11] accept
[1:20:13] it and cannot there is others who can
[1:20:19] accept and some get it without half try
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:28] are you
[1:20:29] together now that we have to preach
[1:20:34] theel that healing is to
[1:20:37] all and we know it is
[1:20:41] not we see God said I hate
[1:20:47] isra said I
[1:20:51] hate and love Jacob you see Jacob didn't
[1:20:55] try
[1:20:57] anything but it was said what said I
[1:21:04] love but this one
[1:21:07] tried he was loved by his
[1:21:10] father but this
[1:21:11] one he was not
[1:21:14] loved but he had the
[1:21:19] promise that's why whatever he
[1:21:23] did was
[1:21:26] but this one even if he he he do
[1:21:30] something he missed the
[1:21:33] target he lose
[1:21:36] focus that's why when he was
[1:21:39] hungry he wanted to eat then Jacob said
[1:21:45] if you I can give you the food but if
[1:21:48] you can give you
[1:21:49] better said
[1:21:55] you don't know what is
[1:21:58] important even now people don't know
[1:22:00] what is important in
[1:22:03] Christianity think what they try to
[1:22:08] do is what is
[1:22:10] important it's not what you try to
[1:22:13] do but what is
[1:22:15] important is the word of God by the word
[1:22:19] of God for your
[1:22:21] age that is what is important
[1:22:24] they asked Jesus what can we do so that
[1:22:27] you can do your
[1:22:30] Works they wanted him to say do this do
[1:22:35] this do this but he said the works is
[1:22:40] when you believe the one he has
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:46] sent are you together with
[1:22:48] me such a simple
[1:22:51] thing believe the word he had
[1:22:56] said and that is what people
[1:23:01] Miss to believe the
[1:23:03] one he had he had
[1:23:08] s all right let me go on
[1:23:12] here we preach
[1:23:16] healing as if healing is for
[1:23:19] all yet do we know it is
[1:23:22] not it is is to
[1:23:26] all if they can receive
[1:23:30] it but we know that they all cannot
[1:23:35] receive I just want to be as
[1:23:41] honest with you as I know how to
[1:23:45] do we have to preach salvation the same
[1:23:49] way that salvation is for
[1:23:52] all but we know that all cannot
[1:23:57] receive all men cannot see these
[1:24:02] things Jesus said blessed that your
[1:24:06] eyes that can see you are you
[1:24:11] understanding for there is many that
[1:24:13] cannot understand
[1:24:17] the Divine Healing is for people who
[1:24:22] believe but you cannot
[1:24:26] believe until something is within
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:33] you to make you to
[1:24:36] be Divine Healing is the fruit of the
[1:24:45] Bride we are living in another
[1:24:49] age we have passed other
[1:24:52] ages we are living in the bright
[1:24:56] age we are living where the seat has
[1:24:59] come to its
[1:25:07] maturity we are living in the SE
[1:25:11] age amen when that which is perfect
[1:25:18] come that which is in
[1:25:22] part will be done away
[1:25:28] with but people miss the mark
[1:25:32] there because they want to do
[1:25:35] something so that they can be seen so
[1:25:38] that they can be
[1:25:40] praised not God be
[1:25:42] praed them to be
[1:25:50] pred this way we are
[1:25:55] let me take a certain brother
[1:25:59] here because the Bible
[1:26:02] says second Corinthians
[1:26:06] 5 he said we don't walk by
[1:26:10] sight we walk by
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:15] faith sight is our
[1:26:19] problem is our
[1:26:22] enemy feeling is our
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:27] after you prayed
[1:26:28] for you wanted to
[1:26:31] feel that pain
[1:26:36] disappearing but if he doesn't
[1:26:40] disappear then you move
[1:26:43] from
[1:26:45] Brother you go
[1:26:47] to so that can pray for you
[1:26:52] also but brother pray
[1:26:55] for because you you still feeling that
[1:27:00] pain go
[1:27:04] to is not the one who
[1:27:08] you is not the one
[1:27:11] who is your
[1:27:13] faith
[1:27:15] in not
[1:27:17] in
[1:27:19] not but in
[1:27:21] God if you can recognize who
[1:27:25] are in this age when you feel pain you
[1:27:30] can go to your next
[1:27:34] sister I've P I pray but that's just
[1:27:39] pray for my
[1:27:40] sister if you recognize each
[1:27:43] other who you
[1:27:47] are you see there is something that you
[1:27:50] cannot do sorry there is something that
[1:27:52] you cannot do
[1:27:54] is to feed the
[1:27:57] sheep feeding the Sheep is for the
[1:28:02] pastor but to pray for one
[1:28:05] another you can do it
[1:28:08] yourself you have that
[1:28:11] power but you cannot
[1:28:15] feed
[1:28:17] feeding is for the
[1:28:21] pastor to feed the sheep
[1:28:25] is his
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:35] responsibility we don't walk by
[1:28:39] side we don't walk by
[1:28:42] feeling we walk by
[1:28:46] faith I'm going
[1:28:49] to you're going to see somebody here but
[1:28:52] let's just pass
[1:28:55] Peter we have seen
[1:28:58] Peter seen
[1:29:00] Jesus Jesus was walking on their
[1:29:05] problem they had a problem the problem
[1:29:08] was the
[1:29:10] ways the problem was the
[1:29:13] winds the ship was going this
[1:29:16] way that was the
[1:29:18] problem when they were in that
[1:29:20] Pro they see their master moving
[1:29:25] working on their
[1:29:28] problem when you are in those
[1:29:31] problem you can see
[1:29:33] Jesus moving on those problem of
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:41] your let me read something for
[1:29:44] you God
[1:29:47] willing I want to read here in this book
[1:29:50] no
[1:29:54] sometimes we have more
[1:29:57] troubles when we come
[1:30:00] Christians than when we did when we were
[1:30:06] Sinners it is written many many is the
[1:30:11] Affliction of
[1:30:15] theous
[1:30:17] the if you are
[1:30:19] theous you have many
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:26] affli
[1:30:29] if if you don't have
[1:30:31] many
[1:30:33] afflictions
[1:30:36] then because the Bible is the
[1:30:40] seed and the Bible is talking about me
[1:30:43] and
[1:30:45] you and we look this our
[1:30:48] mirror we look ourselves when the
[1:30:52] preachers are preaching we look
[1:30:54] ourselves
[1:30:56] in whether it is me whether I am there
[1:31:00] or
[1:31:01] not if you don't find yourself there
[1:31:04] check
[1:31:08] again Satan be your
[1:31:16] eyes many are Affliction of the
[1:31:21] righteous but the god delivered him from
[1:31:25] them
[1:31:28] all when Satan comes like a
[1:31:31] FL raises the
[1:31:35] standard he likes to do that he put you
[1:31:39] in
[1:31:41] that so that he can rise the
[1:31:44] stand so that he can be praised
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:54] God deliver him from
[1:31:58] all promise many
[1:32:02] afflictions strange
[1:32:05] feelings strange
[1:32:07] things that would be beyond our
[1:32:11] understanding but is always done for our
[1:32:17] good we just can't understand
[1:32:20] it because if we did
[1:32:24] then it would not be Faith to
[1:32:29] us
[1:32:31] amen if if I can understand he
[1:32:36] this then I won't have
[1:32:39] faith
[1:32:41] amen I must not
[1:32:43] understand so that I can have
[1:32:46] faith in
[1:32:48] God Amen
[1:32:54] but we do
[1:32:57] it we have it we believe by
[1:33:02] faith his word that is going to work
[1:33:05] some good things for
[1:33:08] us we could grasp that
[1:33:12] today on this morning on in this morning
[1:33:16] we would grasp that all our
[1:33:21] troubles and there is none of of us
[1:33:24] immune from
[1:33:30] them if we could realize those
[1:33:33] things are for our
[1:33:37] good it is written in one of the
[1:33:39] scriptures in the
[1:33:41] Bible that trials are brought upon
[1:33:45] us are more
[1:33:48] precious than gold
[1:33:51] itself it is God giving us this
[1:33:56] trial we become is God who gives us this
[1:34:00] trial after become his
[1:34:04] prop after our
[1:34:06] confession after our baptism after
[1:34:10] promised to walk in his
[1:34:13] life every trial that comes
[1:34:17] upon to perfect
[1:34:20] us his glory he bring us to a
[1:34:24] place where God can make himself more
[1:34:28] real to
[1:34:31] us before before the trial
[1:34:36] come remember in all these
[1:34:39] things Satan tries to make us
[1:34:45] nervous when Peter was looking at
[1:34:50] Jesus they were a
[1:34:56] frighten they thought he was a
[1:35:01] ghost He said don't don't don't be
[1:35:05] afraid he I and Peter said can I come to
[1:35:10] you moving on the
[1:35:13] water Jesus said
[1:35:16] come Jesus said
[1:35:19] come that
[1:35:21] is come
[1:35:24] you see sometimes when we meet some
[1:35:27] problems we even forget what God has
[1:35:31] said about
[1:35:35] us then when we forget Satan gives us
[1:35:40] his more more
[1:35:45] things and Peter got out of the
[1:35:49] sheep looking at Jesus moving on the
[1:35:53] water
[1:36:02] had the Roaring of the
[1:36:06] Waves how violent those waves
[1:36:12] were because of

[1:36:41] there they were
[1:36:45] violent Jesus knew and seen
[1:36:50] them but he said come come
[1:36:53] Jesus
[1:36:55] walking and first Peter
[1:36:59] walked but he lose
[1:37:03] focus Miss

[1:42:27] Target he wouldn't have
[1:42:30] fallen the wind was violent when he went
[1:42:33] out of the

[1:45:41] Ministry and together with
[1:45:46] others
[1:45:48] Luke
[1:45:50] Mark and others
[1:45:53] even the book even the book of
[1:45:55] Colossians chapter
[1:45:59] 4:14 when Paul was in
[1:46:03] prison he spoke about
[1:46:07] de because he was with
[1:46:10] Paul then he
[1:46:13] was he Paul said he was a
[1:46:19] preacher and said he was a preacher
[1:46:25] but later he marked by his decep of
[1:46:29] Paul later he was
[1:46:33] marked by his de of
[1:46:36] Paul that is what the Bible says
[1:46:38] here why did this
[1:46:42] man
[1:46:45] leave listen to what he was
[1:46:49] thinking he knew Paul as a mighty man of
[1:46:55] God who could cast all evil
[1:46:59] spirits who could heal all
[1:47:03] diseases who could raise the
[1:47:06] Dead who could Smite people
[1:47:10] blind if they stood against his
[1:47:14] way
[1:47:18] now there is a man here
[1:47:23] Alexander alexand the copper
[1:47:27] Smith who is torturing
[1:47:31] Paul Paul doing nothing about
[1:47:35] you he thought Paul was washed

[1:47:50] sick Paul cannot him
[1:47:54] but he healed many
[1:47:56] people but here is his
[1:47:59] friend he's
[1:48:01] sick Paul is just
[1:48:05] there he said drink a little
[1:48:09] wi that is what was wondering
[1:48:12] what was was
[1:48:16] amused what Isen with
[1:48:22] himself Paul he was sick he was always
[1:48:27] looking with a doctor next to
[1:48:30] him the doctor was
[1:48:33] Luke if you read where Paul
[1:48:36] was Luke was
[1:48:40] there he was he was he was always
[1:48:43] working with
[1:48:45] Luke Luke The
[1:48:48] Physician the Bible says Luke was a
[1:48:50] physician
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] he lost focus of the word of Jesus
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:02] Christ he lost the
[1:49:05] focus he missed the
[1:49:09] mark that is what happened
[1:49:12] here are you together with me brothers
[1:49:15] and sisters now Damas didn't
[1:49:19] smile he said why didn't he SM SM this
[1:49:23] man
[1:49:27] blind did SM Alexander
[1:49:34] blind he wanted
[1:49:36] to didn't Jesus
[1:49:40] say I do nothing till father shows me
[1:49:48] first if you can see a person say I he
[1:49:52] that one
[1:49:53] I heal this one that one was blind I him
[1:49:59] that one was
[1:50:02] a that is not
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:07] God you cannot use
[1:50:09] God God will use
[1:50:12] you not youing
[1:50:15] him why that makes that that that that
[1:50:21] thing that must miss that
[1:50:25] thing he thought Paul could do
[1:50:29] anything he didn't know that it was God
[1:50:32] working
[1:50:36] through Jesus said I do
[1:50:40] nothing if I don't see my
[1:50:46] father Haven I told you years
[1:50:50] ago with my own mother
[1:50:53] was L dying and would
[1:50:57] say Bill what is My
[1:51:01] outcome I couldn't say nothing till God
[1:51:04] said so
[1:51:06] [Music]
[1:51:08] F that is just what
[1:51:11] happened man
[1:51:14] can't men
[1:51:19] can't man is a failure to begin with
[1:51:25] he's only an agent to which God works
[1:51:30] through God works his own
[1:51:34] will but when you see this super duper
[1:51:40] people that is always this and having
[1:51:43] this and
[1:51:45] that and the other you better stay away
[1:51:49] from
[1:51:50] it Jesus himself didn't do
[1:51:53] that he said I only
[1:51:57] work the father
[1:51:59] Works he shows me what to
[1:52:02] do and then I go do it I can't do other
[1:52:07] anything otherwise than
[1:52:15] that they must lose focus
[1:52:20] there he didn't look at the
[1:52:26] he missed what other people seen in
[1:52:34] Paul let me say this all these
[1:52:38] things brings back his love of
[1:52:47] materialism if you leave something
[1:52:50] bothering you
[1:52:54] which is against the
[1:52:56] words it will bring
[1:52:59] back your are old
[1:53:02] nature you see when you
[1:53:05] repent when you leave things here Satan
[1:53:09] pick them
[1:53:10] up and follows you with
[1:53:14] them when you stop he gives you
[1:53:20] back he don't leave
[1:53:23] he will follow with
[1:53:27] your if you are
[1:53:29] drun he will come back with your
[1:53:39] be that's why all these things which I
[1:53:44] read there while he was
[1:53:47] wondering why why why Paul didn't do
[1:53:50] this why didn't he do this
[1:53:53] why didn't he do this all those things
[1:53:56] brought
[1:53:58] back his laugh of
[1:54:05] mat Paul said he left me because of his
[1:54:09] love of this present
[1:54:15] world of
[1:54:17] men he wanted people to
[1:54:20] say hello Dr de how Dr
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:27] deas he want to be to be
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:37] praised he wanted to be
[1:54:40] somebody it is evident that Dem thought
[1:54:46] that what Satan has to offer him in this
[1:54:49] life
[1:54:53] is better than what God has to offer him
[1:54:55] in the next

[1:58:27] 172 and when he was gone forth into the
[1:58:31] way there came one running and kneeled
[1:58:34] to him and asked him good Master what
[1:58:38] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[1:58:40] life and Jesus said unto him why callest
[1:58:44] thou me good there is none good but one
[1:58:48] that is God thou knowest the
[1:58:50] Commandments do not do not commit
[1:58:53] adultery do not kill do not steal do not
[1:58:56] bear false witness defro not honor thy
[1:59:01] father and mother and he said and he
[1:59:05] answered and said unto him master all
[1:59:08] this have I observed from my youth then
[1:59:11] Jesus beholding him loved him and said
[1:59:13] unto him one thing thou laest go thy way
[1:59:18] sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to
[1:59:21] the poor
[1:59:22] and thou sh have treasure in heaven and
[1:59:25] come take up the cross and follow me and

[1:59:35] possessions thank you very
[1:59:38] much I want to say to John the
[1:59:42] Baptist prepare your people for

[2:00:12] Demus he was born and grew in a good and
[2:00:16] very home
[2:00:22] he was taught the
[2:00:24] law and kept it
[2:00:28] reverently he kept the law from his
[2:00:33] youth that is what that how he answered
[2:00:36] Jesus Jesus said you know the law he
[2:00:41] said no I
[2:00:42] kep from my
[2:00:46] youth he he was not telling Jesus a
[2:00:50] lie he was telling him the
[2:00:54] truth he kept the
[2:00:56] law but down in
[2:00:59] him there was something that belonged
[2:01:02] something
[2:01:09] more he was looking for something
[2:01:13] more then he wanted
[2:01:16] that then he went to the right
[2:01:19] person but something
[2:01:23] caused him to lose
[2:01:28] focus when he was gone forth into the
[2:01:33] way they came one
[2:01:35] running you see his
[2:01:40] approach he had a good
[2:01:42] approach because he was being grown
[2:01:48] religious he had
[2:01:50] respect you see his approach to
[2:01:54] Jesus the Bible says there
[2:01:58] running a rich
[2:02:00] man a richer man running coming to an
[2:02:05] ordinary
[2:02:06] man kneeling down a rich man kneeling
[2:02:11] down to an ordinary
[2:02:14] man he

[2:02:27] Master what shall I do that I may
[2:02:31] inherit eternal
[2:02:33] life Jesus said unto him why call th me
[2:02:39] good there is none

[2:03:35] life said oh the Bible says Jesus
[2:03:40] beholding
[2:03:43] him L
[2:03:46] him and he answered unto him

[2:04:26] answer Jesus answer made him to go
[2:04:37] away he was
[2:04:39] griefed
[2:04:41] why because he had many
[2:04:45] possession he thought Jesus would
[2:04:48] say if you can just give always 10%
