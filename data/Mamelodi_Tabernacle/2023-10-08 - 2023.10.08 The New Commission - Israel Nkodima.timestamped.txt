[31:05] amen
[31:07] uh to be precise it has been 15
[31:11] years
[31:14] after
[31:15] having maybe for lack of better way to
[31:18] gone
[31:20] astray but with uh God in mind and in
[31:25] heart that one day I need to to make
[31:27] things right praise
[31:32] God
[31:35] yes so I
[31:38] met sh to we used to work
[31:43] together
[31:45] and I it was not hidden in a corner amen
[31:51] I reported the matter to the elders and
[31:54] they advice to say no this is not how
[31:56] you do things
[31:57] according to the word of
[31:59] God
[32:02] but s was
[32:05] already in my heart amen amen so then
[32:11] there were not enough
[32:13] resources and then also the
[32:16] understanding of
[32:17] how the order of God works
[32:22] so we want astray but I thank God for
[32:26] today
[32:28] that we are able to do things in the
[32:34] [Applause]
[32:40] land waited 15 years for 15 years it has
[32:45] been with so much pain in the heart
[32:49] that you know there's a saying it you
[32:52] have you you you can't unsee what you
[32:55] have seen neither can you un heere what
[32:59] we've heard once you hear the word of
[33:01] God you will never be the
[33:06] same so with this ring I'd like to thank
[33:11] you sister2 for being patient with
[33:16] me we have been
[33:19] through high and lows of life
[33:22] together and
[33:24] [Music]
[33:25] then until this day
[33:28] this is my home this is my place of
[33:30] worship and I pray it has been always my
[33:34] prayer that we come together you join
[33:38] me we worship God
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:55] together
[33:59] so to continue
[34:06] um I will continue to love you as my
[34:10] wife continue to support you to pray for
[34:15] you and

[34:19] day because it's very soon lots of signs
[34:23] are showing that this world has come to
[34:26] anend
[34:30] I don't know but I the pastor always
[34:33] speaks about the vibration that you feel
[34:35] something even when you you walk you you
[34:38] feel a certain
[34:41] move so it is my prayer
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] that we walk in this journey together
[34:49] and
[34:51] then
[34:53] because truth be told it is an

[49:58] [Music]
[50:00] SS but it don't say nothing about the
[50:10] seventh uh I will suggest to the
[50:14] brothers just to switch this one behind
[50:17] me
[50:18] off
[50:21] because so that I can keep the quality
[50:24] of my voice

[51:05] Brothers amen
[51:08] amen I believe you are an eternal
[51:16] Church okay amen now I I
[51:21] read you
[51:24] notice for the End of Time
[51:29] message
[51:33] this meaning the
[51:36] seventh he's revealed all the six
[51:42] seals but it don't say it say nothing
[51:47] about the
[51:51] seventh and the end time seal
[51:59] when it starts will be absolutely a
[52:03] total
[52:07] secret according to the
[52:11] Bible and
[52:13] remember Revelation
[52:22] 1017 is that I'm less
[52:26] stick to Revelation
[52:31] 8 at the end of the seventh Angel's
[52:42] message all the mysteries of God would
[52:45] be
[52:49] known at the
[52:53] end we're at the end
[52:58] time the opening of the seventh
[53:05] seal it ends the time of all
[53:11] things amen amen
[53:14] amen now if you read this
[53:19] Revelation
[53:20] chapter 8
[53:24] verse1 ver
[53:27] one it
[53:29] says the brothers will help
[53:34] there our
[53:37] brother he will be all
[53:40] right if you read Revelation chapter
[53:46] 8 it tells you
[53:49] that and when he opened the
[53:53] seventh seal
[53:56] there was silence in
[53:58] heaven about the space of half an
[54:05] hour all
[54:07] right now this seventh
[54:12] seal uh when it is
[54:18] open not when it is
[54:23] preached the people
[54:25] have been
[54:27] waiting
[54:28] for a
[54:30] preaching on this
[54:36] subject but this one was not
[54:41] preached but was
[54:47] open now that's why the people are
[54:50] saying it is not revealed because they
[54:54] were waiting for for it to be
[55:00] preached but the Bible don't tell us
[55:03] about the
[55:06] preaching it tells us about the
[55:13] opening so we were rather waiting for it
[55:16] to be
[55:20] open not to be
[55:23] preached because
[55:26] this is the
[55:27] end of the seventh Angel's
[55:34] message amen
[55:36] amen now this
[55:40] ministry speaks about the
[55:43] opening not the
[55:47] preaching that's why we'll continue to
[55:49] look into
[55:52] it it is the closing
[55:58] and this one is the end of all
[56:04] things
[56:05] this
[56:08] seventh it says the seventh
[56:11] SE the end of
[56:17] all okay
[56:20] amen
[56:22] now you know we look at the the
[56:26] seventh the
[56:29] sixth then we realize the Sixth
[56:34] Seal how many
[56:40] remember amen you know the six and the
[56:44] Seven speaks about men people because
[56:49] the six is Moses and
[56:53] Elijah
[56:57] on the other
[56:58] side of the
[57:00] Rapture Moses and
[57:02] Elijah will come with
[57:06] that as we are going to look into this
[57:10] again the
[57:12] Gentiles the time of the
[57:15] Gentiles is
[57:18] over and what happens
[57:22] then amen amen where are
[57:27] we
[57:28] now we looking
[57:31] at the ministry that that is opened
[57:40] am while the people are waiting for the
[57:48] preaching now
[57:50] instead the Lord opened
[57:56] to
[57:57] his
[57:59] bride
[58:01] amen amen amen now preaching is a
[58:05] different
[58:07] thing
[58:09] from
[58:13] opening you understand
[58:15] that okay amen that's why when he arrive
[58:21] here it is not preaching now
[58:26] he started to open open open
[58:31] open to the
[58:34] bride is the
[58:37] opening
[58:39] amen amen amen
[58:42] amen you can
[58:45] preach a
[58:50] mystery but you can
[58:53] open
[58:55] the mystery so the
[58:58] Mysteries it doesn't say it is now the
[59:01] preaching of
[59:04] the it is the
[59:08] opening amen you can't preach the
[59:11] seventh
[59:13] seal no it was
[59:16] open and the people are waiting for a
[59:20] preaching but the bride has received
[59:25] because it was
[59:30] opened there's difference between
[59:33] preaching and
[59:38] open that's why it says when he
[59:43] opened it doesn't say when he
[59:48] preached when he opened the seventh
[59:52] SE silence
[59:58] all right amen now let's look at
[1:00:03] this what actually
[1:00:06] happened we were looking at this
[1:00:10] last let me look at this book
[1:00:15] here and
[1:00:17] uh talking
[1:00:20] about
[1:00:23] the commission
[1:00:29] now there was the first
[1:00:32] commission was to pray for the
[1:00:37] sick
[1:00:39] but this commission
[1:00:42] here is about the
[1:00:49] Angels now the ministry would rage is
[1:00:54] now
[1:00:55] change to the second
[1:01:01] commission the first is just praying for
[1:01:06] the people and so
[1:01:08] for but the
[1:01:10] second is
[1:01:15] Angels okay amen as we read this part
[1:01:23] last when the prophet said I was still
[1:01:27] looking West
[1:01:32] toward now if you look into your
[1:01:37] Bible men the men was put
[1:01:44] Eastward didn't it say
[1:01:48] so the Book of
[1:01:51] Genesis man was put Eastward
[1:01:59] that's the
[1:02:01] garden and what was in the
[1:02:09] west because you come
[1:02:13] sometimes to where it
[1:02:15] says we will read it it is there East
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:21] West Has Come Together
[1:02:26] amen the connection of the
[1:02:30] Angel was with with an
[1:02:34] angel connection with an
[1:02:38] angel amen
[1:02:41] amen that's when he was amen he was
[1:02:46] connected to the
[1:02:50] two which
[1:02:52] side he says I went
[1:02:55] W to connect with an
[1:03:00] angel and he says the
[1:03:03] Angels were coming from the
[1:03:08] West because men Adam was
[1:03:16] placed all right
[1:03:18] am
[1:03:20] now that's why
[1:03:23] now
[1:03:25] if you go west
[1:03:28] now you'll miss the whole
[1:03:34] thing he said then I
[1:03:39] return I
[1:03:46] went that's why the Bible says the Lord
[1:03:49] shall come
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:53] from
[1:03:55] East and a man was placed
[1:04:04] East
[1:04:06] then I
[1:04:10] read here it says the end of the seventh
[1:04:14] Angel's
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:20] message no the end of the seventh
[1:04:25] Angel
[1:04:32] message at the
[1:04:34] end of the seventh Angel's
[1:04:41] message all the mysteries of God would
[1:04:45] be
[1:04:49] known
[1:04:51] amen say this
[1:04:54] amen is
[1:05:00] passed and it
[1:05:02] says at that
[1:05:04] end of the seventh Angels
[1:05:09] message all the
[1:05:12] mysteries of God would be
[1:05:19] known all right
[1:05:22] amen so
[1:05:24] some
[1:05:25] people while some people are still
[1:05:32] striving to have the seventh seal
[1:05:37] opened you will realize
[1:05:40] that there is the bread of
[1:05:45] Christ she's not waiting for the seven
[1:05:48] seal to be
[1:05:50] revealed because at the
[1:05:53] end of the
[1:05:55] ministry of the message of the seventh
[1:05:58] angel
[1:06:00] message all
[1:06:04] Mysteries including the
[1:06:09] seventh
[1:06:11] revealed you know in the whole
[1:06:15] Ministry God has left this part for
[1:06:17] himself and the and
[1:06:23] his
[1:06:27] amen just as you we have seen
[1:06:33] here the
[1:06:35] bridegroom and the
[1:06:38] bride amen

[1:29:08] se you look at the
[1:29:11] mystery will continue to see
[1:29:15] it the coming
[1:29:18] days all right but let's look at this
[1:29:24] the coming days can only be one
[1:29:28] day I was caught up in this
[1:29:37] pyramid for God to deal with
[1:29:41] Amen to accept
[1:29:46] you he puts you in a
[1:29:50] constellation
[1:29:54] amen because every time he
[1:29:58] speaks the
[1:30:00] message is
[1:30:03] head in the
[1:30:07] constellation in the constellation you
[1:30:11] hear God
[1:30:13] without you hear the
[1:30:19] preachers have you heard that
[1:30:22] why the
[1:30:23] constellation because we have we had
[1:30:27] that message last
[1:30:33] time the
[1:30:35] constellation to come in the
[1:30:39] constellation if God is going to
[1:30:43] continually speak to
[1:30:46] you he will put you in a
[1:30:50] con
[1:30:54] amen because in the
[1:30:57] constellation you don't have
[1:31:02] interpreters the way that is given to
[1:31:06] you is interpreted
[1:31:14] already everywh
[1:31:17] that God
[1:31:20] Amen sent to us
[1:31:24] it is already
[1:31:31] interpreted that's why we just say
[1:31:36] [Applause]

[1:31:42] yet I
[1:31:45] could now those

[1:31:56] now this seventh
[1:32:00] angel
[1:32:03] messenger could not operate
[1:32:08] without he has to be
[1:32:13] put in the
[1:32:18] constellation the pyramid because this
[1:32:22] message is for the
[1:32:30] Insiders not the people that are
[1:32:34] residing
[1:32:39] outside I don't need to interpret
[1:32:43] it the time it arrives said the
[1:32:46] Bri it already
[1:32:50] inter am
[1:32:53] am that's why it will only receive
[1:32:57] amen amen amen interpreted
[1:33:00] already when the message reached Rebecca
[1:33:04] it was already
[1:33:09] interpreted that's why re didn't ask for
[1:33:12] the photo of
[1:33:17] Isaiah like
[1:33:19] saying but this you saying
[1:33:24] ISAC don't you have a
[1:33:30] photo

[1:33:52] with
[1:33:55] questions she knew that she's going to
[1:33:59] meet the
[1:34:01] one
[1:34:03] was prepared for
[1:34:10] her if you are from
[1:34:16] God and

[1:36:03] sister because it was Adam and
[1:36:09] Eve he P
[1:36:13] them just like that amen
[1:36:18] now
[1:36:20] if
[1:36:22] as the
[1:36:25] prophet
[1:36:28] if it's not a good
[1:36:33] one or she's not up to your

[1:37:38] road I must not tell my
[1:37:41] people he thought that he was
[1:37:46] dying then it came to me while I was in

[1:37:56] if it would have killed
[1:37:59] you have killed
[1:38:04] Joseph that's what he has said
[1:38:08] constellation and I could hear J calling
[1:38:13] me then I turned again and I thought

[1:38:23] I wondered then it came to
[1:38:27] me not a
[1:38:30] voice just came to
[1:38:33] me that is the
[1:38:37] angels of the
[1:38:39] Lord that is the
[1:38:41] angels of the Lord coming to give
[1:38:46] me my
[1:38:49] new not that the old
[1:38:53] commission my new
[1:38:59] one that is that amen now let us close
[1:39:04] with

[1:39:47] forth we'll come to these
[1:39:50] things

[1:39:56] says he was
[1:39:59] counting left to
[1:40:03] right it would have
[1:40:06] been the seventh
[1:40:11] angel as he saw them
[1:40:15] coming coming

[1:50:48] church he never said to the
[1:50:52] to the
[1:50:53] church the church is the
[1:51:00] body we part of
[1:51:03] it he came back to reveal
[1:51:08] it to the
[1:51:10] church we are part of
[1:51:15] it he never said to preach
[1:51:18] it but to reveal it
[1:51:21] preaching and
[1:51:23] revealing is two different
[1:51:26] things if God has revealed to
[1:51:30] you it's something
[1:51:34] else a preacher can preach to
[1:51:37] you and you still need
[1:51:43] Revelation but now you'll see as we'll
[1:51:46] come back that today is not something PR
[1:51:51] us the
[1:51:55] ration amen you can't preach the
[1:51:59] Mysteries the Mysteries are not
[1:52:03] preached
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:11] revealed that's
[1:52:14] why he came back to reveal
[1:52:18] it
[1:52:21] you'll see even when the prophet speaks
[1:52:24] about that
[1:52:28] book
[1:52:30] The which book is that the book of
[1:52:34] redemption the book of
[1:52:38] redemption you know the book of
[1:52:44] redemption we'll come to that if your
[1:52:47] name is in that book you know the
[1:52:53] book that's why you can't preach the
[1:52:56] seven Revelation
[1:53:05] chapter when he
[1:53:11] opened the
[1:53:14] seven what
[1:53:18] happened in
[1:53:22] heaven
[1:53:24] because he
[1:53:27] opened you know I read about the book
[1:53:32] here chapter
[1:53:34] 5 Revelation 5 is it the one that speaks
[1:53:38] about the the one the book on the right
[1:53:42] the one with the
[1:53:46] book on the right hand side amen
[1:53:51] that's why to those who
[1:53:54] understand when I greet them I
[1:54:01] say the people of the right hand I'm not
[1:54:04] talking
[1:54:06] about I'm talking about the right
[1:54:16] people the right people
[1:54:22] this this right hand people are they who
