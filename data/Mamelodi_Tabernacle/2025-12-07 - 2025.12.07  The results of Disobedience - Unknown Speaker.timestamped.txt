[1:19:03] but they will come and fish to eat

[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; because I love his church
[1:19:57] and I I want I want to see the
[1:20:00] well-being of the church.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I want to see the well-being of the
[1:20:05] church. Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And even the pastor you are going to

[1:20:21] because because I love this church.
[1:20:26] [applause] Thank you very much.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; We have got uh the couple here
[1:20:34] bring their child
[1:20:37] because they love that child.
[1:20:40] They said, "M, we must let that child
[1:20:44] pass
[1:20:50] to God."
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; But not to
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; But to God,
[1:21:03] not
[1:21:06] But to God,
[1:21:11] [applause]
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I'm I really they make me happy.
[1:21:19] Let's read because whatever we do,
[1:21:24] it must come from the word of God.
[1:21:29] If it doesn't come from the word of God,
[1:21:33] you have the right to
[1:21:35] to to reject it. You have the right
[1:21:40] to reject that thing.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Mark 10 from verse 13- 16.
[1:21:49] And they brought young children to him
[1:21:51] that he should touch them. And his
[1:21:53] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:21:55] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:21:58] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[1:22:01] the little children to come unto me, and
[1:22:03] forbid them not, for of such is the
[1:22:06] kingdom of God."
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall
[1:22:11] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[1:22:13] little child, he shall not enter
[1:22:15] therein. And he took them up in his
[1:22:18] arms, put his hands upon them, and
[1:22:20] blessed them.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; He took them into his arms.
[1:22:26] It was Jesus doing that.
[1:22:30] I am doing it in his place. Today
[1:22:35] I've taken this child into my arm.
[1:22:39] I believe it's Jesus who is going to use
[1:22:41] my arms today.
[1:22:45] I believe with all my heart
[1:22:49] and I believe the family also believes
[1:22:51] that
[1:22:54] if we believe
[1:22:56] God will take over
[1:22:59] let's pray.
[1:23:01] My dear beloved,
[1:23:03] in this time of trouble
[1:23:06] where Satan has come up
[1:23:09] against the children,
[1:23:12] we have only one
[1:23:15] tower,
[1:23:16] place of refuge.
[1:23:19] That is your name. And we when we have

[1:27:12] Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; And you are making me pleased
[1:27:16] because that man
[1:27:20] has brought everything unto us.

[1:27:27] We lack nothing.
[1:27:30] We lack nothing.
[1:27:33] because of that man.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; What she has brought
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; is still with us.
[1:27:44] We would not be like this
[1:27:48] if it was not because of him.
[1:27:56] Uh brothers and sisters,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I want to thank
[1:28:03] our board
[1:28:06] and the elders
[1:28:09] for the work they are they they do.
[1:28:16] Um, Mete and Elders,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; they went that side to help the family
[1:28:26] to bury their loved ones.
[1:28:34] Even when we were going through the
[1:28:37] marriage,
[1:28:40] they helped another family
[1:28:44] contacting the barrier.
[1:28:48] and even last Saturday
[1:28:52] and brothers
[1:28:59] and even those who perhaps I've not
[1:29:02] mentioned
[1:29:05] they went to
[1:29:09] help us
[1:29:12] to bury one of us to bury one of us
[1:29:18] You must know they are doing that in my
[1:29:20] place.
[1:29:29] [applause]
[1:29:31] [clears throat]
[1:29:36] doing those things
[1:29:38] but they were doing those things for me.
[1:29:43] So that is the reason I have to thank
[1:29:46] them very much.
[1:29:52] This church is established.
[1:29:58] [applause]
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; They can do things for themselves.
[1:30:07] They lack nothing.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; We really uh I think they will they will
[1:30:16] always
[1:30:18] send message to
[1:30:25] thanking him also
[1:30:28] because he is he's one of our
[1:30:30] subordinates.
[1:30:35] I had a message
[1:30:39] from a reliable source
[1:30:43] that our late pastor.
[1:30:48] He had in his mind
[1:30:52] that he will bring me and pastor Miva
[1:30:55] here.
[1:30:58] Me and Pastor M
[1:31:00] and introduce us to you
[1:31:04] that we shall go on with you.
[1:31:09] But pastor Miva told me
[1:31:13] that I am confident in you.
[1:31:20] I'm I'm giving I'm I'm giving you the my
[1:31:24] full support.
[1:31:30] [applause] I believe you you are the one
[1:31:33] who will be able to help those.
[1:31:39] You must know that I am here. I've have
[1:31:41] the support of pastor MBA.
[1:31:49] But if one day
[1:31:52] if it happened that I send him here,
[1:31:57] you must know he has been sent by me.
[1:32:04] He's not he is not gate crashing.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Is me
[1:32:12] sending him.
[1:32:14] Amen.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; There is a there is a certain
[1:32:23] uh
[1:32:26] thing I want to clarify a certain lie.
[1:32:35] I want to clarify it
[1:32:39] to you church.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; That lie is
[1:32:45] And it is spreading fast
[1:32:49] saying that
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; is the one who brought Mete and Scosana
[1:32:58] back.
[1:33:03] That one is a lie from the devil.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; You must tell the one who tell you that
[1:33:16] my brother sorry
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; you are attacked
[1:33:25] is not me
[1:33:28] is the pastor himself
[1:33:35] he is the one who told me.
[1:33:41] When I went to him,
[1:33:44] I was going to ask for additional
[1:33:46] preachers
[1:33:51] to help Mahar.
[1:33:54] I was with Eld.
[1:33:58] The pastor told me
[1:34:01] where is
[1:34:06] [applause]
[1:34:07] he is he is the preacher there
[1:34:16] [applause]
[1:34:20] or
[1:34:22] do you say I'm telling you lie
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; sorry
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; do you say I'm telling you lie
[1:34:32] is a witness.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Is a witness
[1:34:40] is a witness.
[1:34:42] And I told the
[1:34:50] brother I said if the pastor can say
[1:34:53] something
[1:34:56] contrary to what he has told me now.
[1:35:03] You must record the pastor
[1:35:08] and send that message quickly to me.
[1:35:12] so that I could come fast,
[1:35:15] so that I cannot do something which is
[1:35:17] against my pastor.
[1:35:23] Until now,
[1:35:25] I haven't received anything
[1:35:28] to me that still stands.
[1:35:34] [applause]
[1:35:39] I I want to correct that lie.
[1:35:45] You see people talking lies like that.
[1:35:51] They must think what David did.
[1:35:56] I must I I am the anointed
[1:36:00] pastor of God.
[1:36:07] If you talk lie about me,
[1:36:10] God will punish you.
[1:36:15] It may not be today.
[1:36:18] But that thing will follow you
[1:36:23] and it will follow even your children.
[1:36:26] You must correct that lie.
[1:36:34] On that day,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I I I I I I was having two things.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; The the other one
[1:36:43] was to [music] tell the pastor about the
[1:36:46] conference.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do in the
[1:36:51] conference?
[1:36:55] Read the minutes from the board.
[1:37:02] about the conference.
[1:37:05] When he was reading the minutes,
[1:37:08] there was the place where the board in
[1:37:12] that minutes
[1:37:16] saying that Elder um
[1:37:21] is going to be the chair, the the master
[1:37:23] of ceremony in that conference.
[1:37:30] conference.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; The pastor said, "Let it be. Let it let
[1:37:35] it be.
[1:37:38] I still have those minutes.
[1:37:41] I cancelled.
[1:37:48] I still have those minutes."
[1:37:50] And we were saying something about um
[1:37:54] someone who will be responsible for
[1:37:57] listing pastors
[1:38:04] there in the minutes.
[1:38:07] Then the pastor said in the minutes they
[1:38:10] said it will be
[1:38:17] the pastor said it must be het
[1:38:25] [applause] we must take over those side.
[1:38:29] It is his it is his position
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; is not me.
[1:38:39] is the pastor himself
[1:38:42] whether you take it or not.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; That is what my pastor has told me
[1:38:50] and I stand by that
[1:38:58] anything
[1:39:01] told me about letters issued
[1:39:07] I I I I went to the pastor.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I said, "Can I announce these letters to
[1:39:13] the church?"
[1:39:17] He said, "No, no, no."
[1:39:20] Why? Why did he say that?
[1:39:26] because he didn't want to come and
[1:39:29] and go back
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; because anything
[1:39:37] must be you mustn't take anything
[1:39:42] if it is not from the pulpit here
[1:39:46] [applause]
[1:39:48] that is church order
[1:39:51] anything that is not from the the church
[1:39:53] that the They they bought here
[1:39:57] is a gossip.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Be careful of those things.
[1:40:11] If someone told you we shall you must
[1:40:14] tell it we shall listen to the pulpit.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; We shall listen to the announcement.
[1:40:22] TV show.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me, church?
[1:40:33] Leave those people. God will deal with
[1:40:36] them.
[1:40:38] Even David
[1:40:41] didn't want to touch Saul.
[1:40:44] Even if Saul was after David,
[1:40:48] David said, "This is the anointed of
[1:40:50] God.
[1:40:53] If the anointed of God, you mustn't just
[1:40:56] talk.
[1:40:58] If he is, even if he's wrong,
[1:41:01] you mustn't just talk.
[1:41:07] That person is the anointed of God.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; All right. I I I just wanted to to to
[1:41:18] clarify this lie.
[1:41:23] Um,
[1:41:26] let's just
[1:41:28] h I want to to to
[1:41:32] put the video of my pastor here
[1:41:37] and hear what the pastor says about
[1:41:39] church order.
[1:41:44] Let's let's hear
[1:41:50] While we are preaching here, we are
[1:41:53] preaching just to a small
[1:41:56] group,
[1:42:00] not the other churches.
[1:42:04] Yeah. Our way our our way here is going
[1:42:08] to the heart, not to the church.
[1:42:14] That's why
[1:42:17] some are say are talking about the
[1:42:22] fivefold ministry
[1:42:25] ministry
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; but they don't know what is fivefold
[1:42:28] ministry.
[1:42:30] All right. We've got them
[1:42:35] prepared them for us
[1:42:39] only. We don't we also don't make use of
[1:42:42] them.
[1:42:44] That's why we will go
[1:42:48] the other way.
[1:42:50] Okay. Let us go back to the church
[1:42:52] order.
[1:42:56] If each and every one of us
[1:43:03] can get a copy
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and look at the church order.
[1:43:09] Amen. All right.
[1:43:13] Yeah. Without church order, things go
[1:43:17] the other way.
[1:43:22] [applause]
[1:43:24] Have you have you heard that?
[1:43:28] That's why
[1:43:30] even
[1:43:32] pastor said to me
[1:43:36] we know you pastor no one will take you
[1:43:39] away from church order
[1:43:44] even now over my dead body
[1:43:50] I will not move from church order.
[1:43:55] You can ridicu me.
[1:43:59] and talk bad about me. I will not I will
[1:44:02] not worry.
[1:44:04] But when you force to go out of church,
[1:44:09] if you want to see me furious,
[1:44:13] try to go out of church order.
[1:44:17] I will not I will never allow you.
[1:44:21] We we better we better our our
[1:44:24] relationship. It it might it can be
[1:44:27] broken.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We must follow church order. Put what
[1:44:35] the pastor said there.
[1:44:46] Let's let's hear what the pastor is
[1:44:48] saying.
[1:44:51] I want us to hear the our pastor.
[1:44:59] The people who after following Moses
[1:45:04] followed Joshua
[1:45:08] and the the prophet
[1:45:11] not a certain pastor.
[1:45:13] Uh please don't listen and say brother
[1:45:18] says it should be this
[1:45:22] you take it from God's prophet
[1:45:27] Paul says follow me as I follow
[1:45:34] me as I follow the prophets.
[1:45:39] Amen.
[1:45:40] But if I don't follow the prophet, don't
[1:45:43] follow me.
[1:45:45] I am leading you astray.
[1:45:49] Check whether the message I preach is
[1:45:51] from the word of God.
[1:45:57] All right. Check. Thank you, my
[1:45:58] brothers.
[1:46:01] Have you heard what the pastor said?
[1:46:04] He said, don't say pastor.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Don't say,
[1:46:19] take it from the prophet.
[1:46:23] But when you go around saying pastor,
[1:46:26] it's up to you.
[1:46:33] It's not what he said.
[1:46:35] He said you must take it from
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; the prophet.
[1:46:41] [applause]
[1:46:45] Have you heard him?
[1:46:51] I want you to flesh the chesh or
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to those technical group them
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; that is the church.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; He said that is that first the first is
[1:47:11] the placing of some deacons into the
[1:47:13] church.
[1:47:17] He said our little church here
[1:47:21] is sovereign.
[1:47:23] It doesn't have any denomination or
[1:47:26] anything to send it deacons.
[1:47:33] It elects its own deacons.
[1:47:37] It elects its pastor.
[1:47:41] as you are going to do that
[1:47:44] it it elects its trustees.
[1:47:49] It elects everything that comes in
[1:47:55] and out.
[1:47:57] In other words, it's the church
[1:48:02] which allows you to come in.
[1:48:05] It's the church which can take you out.
[1:48:10] That is what the the church order says.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; No one person has the say so over
[1:48:17] anything
[1:48:21] is the church.
[1:48:24] And the church are those who come
[1:48:28] and support the church
[1:48:31] with their presence
[1:48:34] with their tithe.
[1:48:36] offering
[1:48:38] are always the ones that has the legal
[1:48:41] say. So
[1:48:47] in the placing of such
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; the church
[1:48:56] [applause]
[1:48:58] another quote
[1:49:03] is our little church here.
[1:49:06] is is sovereign.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have any denomination.
[1:49:13] All right. Another another another one.
[1:49:16] All right. This one super sense. Yeah.
[1:49:20] It is official as long as the church
[1:49:26] in our church. It is sovereignity of the
[1:49:30] church.
[1:49:32] The church moves
[1:49:36] or puts
[1:49:39] in the trust in the in the trust.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; The church moves
[1:49:46] the pastor
[1:49:48] or put in the pastor.
[1:49:51] Whatever it is, it is the church in all
[1:49:57] that is the apostolic.
[1:50:00] That is the way it did in the Bible
[1:50:03] time.
[1:50:06] Therefore, we feel that
[1:50:08] no one person
[1:50:11] then it then it is a dictator or
[1:50:14] something in the church.
[1:50:21] No one person.
[1:50:23] We don't want that.
[1:50:27] You don't want me to be dictated.
[1:50:32] Every man,
[1:50:34] every person, myself that is the pastor
[1:50:38] that is that is Brennham
[1:50:41] and myself as the pastor here in voting.
[1:50:46] Anyone
[1:50:48] I just got one vote
[1:50:53] just like any other person
[1:50:56] of the church here. just one vote. In
[1:51:00] other words, I can't say
[1:51:02] you are no more coming to church.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; I can't say that.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; It is the church.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Because I have got one vote.
[1:51:17] It it is what the church says. See
[1:51:21] what the church says in the body.
[1:51:24] You like that? Oh, I think that is just
[1:51:28] scriptural.
[1:51:30] That is the way it should be.
[1:51:35] Let's give another one. The last one I
[1:51:38] think for
[1:51:47] when the time comes you you must listen.
[1:51:51] When the time comes
[1:51:53] as under God,
[1:51:57] if I feel like that woman
[1:52:03] can no more qualify to be a pastor here,
[1:52:09] I'm going to mention it to the church.
[1:52:14] When I see one thing
[1:52:17] here, I think that you deacons
[1:52:21] couldn't qualify to be deacons,
[1:52:25] I'm going to mention it to the church
[1:52:29] and that I find out the I think that you
[1:52:34] decon.
[1:52:37] I'm going to mention it to the church.
[1:52:41] I find out there is a certain deacon out
[1:52:45] here
[1:52:49] doing something he shouldn't do.
[1:52:53] He doesn't keep his position of duty
[1:52:59] so forth
[1:53:00] or trustee or whatever.
[1:53:04] I can't vote it in or out.
[1:53:11] The church has to do that.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; But I'm sitting going to present it
[1:53:18] before the church.
[1:53:22] See, because that is what it should do.
[1:53:27] And that is what I am supposed to be
[1:53:32] as an overseer.
[1:53:35] I'm supposed to look and see what is
[1:53:37] going on.
[1:53:40] We are going to heaven
[1:53:43] not somewhere or in a rally somewhere.
[1:53:50] Just just just please Christ is the
[1:53:52] mystery of God. Just please that before

[1:55:05] to make him his target,
[1:55:08] he will bring some critic
[1:55:13] or unbeliever
[1:55:16] and sit him down
[1:55:19] and cause him to fellowship with you

[1:56:40] to do so.

[1:57:40] He is my left hand.
[1:57:42] I want him to be to stay there.
[1:57:46] Even the little tip of my finger,
[1:57:50] I want it to stay right there.
[1:57:53] Every little part of my body,
[1:57:56] it must stay right there.
[1:57:58] God wants us as a body of believers
[1:58:03] to stay exactly with one another
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; and and right with one another.

[1:58:33] to perhap I can take 13 minutes or 45. I
[1:58:35] don't know how many minutes I will take.
[1:58:41] 1 Samuel 15 18 to 23
[1:58:48] verse 18.
[1:58:53] You must understand brothers and
[1:58:54] sisters.
[1:58:56] I love every one of you.
[1:59:00] I against anybody.
[1:59:04] Anything I do,
[1:59:07] I will follow.
[1:59:10] I will just I I won't say you are wrong
[1:59:14] until I come to you
[1:59:17] and say you are wrong.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I won't tell anybody this and
[1:59:23] that one is that one.
[1:59:29] I won't do that. I won't do that.
[1:59:32] Read my brother.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 15 from verse 18.
[1:59:37] And the Lord sent thee on a journey and
[1:59:40] said, "Go and utterly destroy the
[1:59:43] sinners, the Amalachites, and fight
[1:59:46] against them until they be consumed."
[1:59:50] Wherefore then did thou not obey the
[1:59:53] voice of the Lord, but did fly upon the
[1:59:56] spoil, and did evil in the sight of the
[1:59:59] Lord? And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yeah,
[2:00:02] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and
[2:00:05] have gone the way which the Lord sent
[2:00:07] me, and have brought Ag, the king of
[2:00:10] Amalecch, and have utterly destroyed the
[2:00:13] Amalachites." But the people took of the
[2:00:16] spoil, sheep, and oxen, the chief of the
[2:00:19] things which should have been utterly
[2:00:22] destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord
[2:00:25] thy God in Gilgal.
[2:00:28] And Samuel said, "Had the Lord as great
[2:00:31] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice
[2:00:35] as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
[2:00:37] Behold, to obey is better than
[2:00:40] sacrifice, and to haken than the fat of
[2:00:44] rams. For rebellion is as the sin of
[2:00:48] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[2:00:51] iniquity as idolatry. Because thou hast
[2:00:55] rejected the word of the Lord, he hath
[2:00:57] also rejected thee from being king.
[2:01:01] My topic,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; little topic
[2:01:07] is the results of disobedience.
[2:01:13] Let's pray.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; My heavenly father,
[2:01:18] these are your children.
[2:01:20] You know their hearts and you know my
[2:01:23] heart.
[2:01:25] I'm standing here
[2:01:27] because I love them.
[2:01:30] We are here to advise one another
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; with your word.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Your word is a mirror unto us.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Help me and my brother
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; to convey only your message.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; What? Not what we wish.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; But your message to your children in the
[2:01:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:01:51] Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; We may take our seat
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; in some in some cases.
[2:02:00] I'm not going to even read the quotes
[2:02:02] I've written here.
[2:02:06] I will just going to go over them.
[2:02:11] Disobedience.
[2:02:13] When we say the result of disobedience.
[2:02:18] What is disobedience?
[2:02:21] Is disobedience to what?
[2:02:24] This is disobedience to the revealed
[2:02:27] word of your hour.
[2:02:33] They have reflected there
[2:02:36] is a is a the Bible say it is a
[2:02:39] rebellion
[2:02:42] is is rebelling against what?
[2:02:46] the revealed word of God.
[2:02:51] That is disobedience
[2:02:54] and also to to to
[2:02:58] disobey
[2:03:01] the church order.
[2:03:04] That is disobedience
[2:03:08] to disobey the word of God
[2:03:12] and disobey the church order.
[2:03:16] church order. God doesn't like those.
[2:03:21] Um
[2:03:23] you see I am here in front of you
[2:03:28] and you are here in front of me
[2:03:32] in the state what you are.
[2:03:35] We are wearing this body.
[2:03:38] It's not because of our will.
[2:03:43] This calls this body a pest house.
[2:03:51] Is because we are wearing this body.
[2:03:55] This body is the result of disobedience.
[2:04:02] Is the result of disobedience of Eve.
[2:04:05] there
[2:04:08] because if disobeyed God
[2:04:13] we are what we are today
[2:04:17] that is the results of disobedience
[2:04:22] in the times of Noah.
[2:04:26] The results of disobedience.
[2:04:31] I want my brother to read first Peter.
[2:04:36] chapter 3 verse 18- 20
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; verse chapter 3 verse 18 to 20
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; here
[2:04:43] if you find it you read it here
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; it is it is telling us about people
[2:04:51] who because of their disobedience
[2:04:56] they found themselves here in hell
[2:05:01] that is the result of their
[2:05:04] disobedience.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Read it, my brother. There
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; first Peter 3:20.
[2:05:11] Which sometime were disobedient when
[2:05:13] once the longsuffering of God waited in
[2:05:16] the days of Noah, while the ark was
[2:05:19] preparing where in few that is eight
[2:05:22] souls were saved by water. These people
[2:05:26] who are in hell here, the Bible says it
[2:05:30] is because of disobedience.
[2:05:36] These people, they are the preachers
[2:05:41] in Noah's time.
[2:05:44] They were preaching in Noah's time.
[2:05:47] We have said disobedience is when you
[2:05:50] disobey.
[2:05:53] You disobey the message of your time.
[2:05:59] Because in each age,
[2:06:02] God has a message for that age.
[2:06:08] You will never go back.
[2:06:10] Say, I believe that one.
[2:06:13] You must believe the message
[2:06:17] that God has brought to you at that
[2:06:19] time.
[2:06:22] And these people here they were
[2:06:24] preachers
[2:06:26] according to the book the the prophet's
[2:06:29] message
[2:06:31] there were preachers who were preaching
[2:06:34] during Noah's time but their problem
[2:06:38] here they disbelieve
[2:06:42] they believe message of Noah
[2:06:48] then we see them here
[2:06:51] because of their disobedience.
[2:06:54] They are here in hell.
[2:06:58] Are you together with me? But they were
[2:07:01] pastors, preachers.
[2:07:04] And the Bible says as it was
[2:07:07] it will be like this.
[2:07:10] In other words, in our age,
[2:07:14] there will be preachers
[2:07:17] who will disobey.
[2:07:20] the message of their time. And if God
[2:07:25] punish those,
[2:07:27] if God punish those,
[2:07:30] he will also punish these ones
[2:07:34] because they disobey the message of
[2:07:36] their hour.
[2:07:40] We have got another person here.
[2:07:45] You must listen carefully
[2:07:47] when you read the first Kings 13 verse
[2:07:50] 1-24.
[2:07:54] Here there was a prophet.
[2:07:59] He was sent by God
[2:08:02] to
[2:08:07] God said to that prophet
[2:08:10] when you go there
[2:08:12] just take my message there.
[2:08:15] When we brought the message, you must
[2:08:18] come back. You must not eat
[2:08:22] and drink
[2:08:24] there. Come back. He had the message
[2:08:29] that he and and he brought that message
[2:08:31] exactly
[2:08:34] exactly what God said to him.
[2:08:38] He failed
[2:08:41] because when he was going back,
[2:08:44] he met another old prophet.
[2:08:49] And that old prophet, he said to this
[2:08:52] one, "I am also a prophet.
[2:08:59] You must not listen to anybody
[2:09:02] whether prophet or not prophet.
[2:09:07] listen to the message of the hour.
[2:09:12] He said, "I am also a prophet."
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And he said, "God told me
[2:09:19] that you must go back with me
[2:09:23] and then eat
[2:09:25] and drink
[2:09:29] instead of this one taking the weight
[2:09:33] because he had God.
[2:09:36] himself.
[2:09:38] But there is another name here. He said,
[2:09:41] I I
[2:09:43] I've also heard from God.
[2:09:46] You mustn't take anything which is not
[2:09:48] from church order.
[2:09:53] You mustn't take anything which is not
[2:09:55] from the word of God.
[2:09:58] That is what our pastor said that
[2:10:02] he said it doesn't matter what it comes
[2:10:04] from me
[2:10:07] but it must come from the word of God.
[2:10:11] You must take what God has told you.
[2:10:16] But this man went back
[2:10:18] with that old prophet and he went there
[2:10:22] and he ate and he died.
[2:10:27] Listen the result there.
[2:10:31] That old prophet,
[2:10:35] the spirit came into him,
[2:10:38] he prophesied.
[2:10:40] He said because you didn't listen to
[2:10:42] God,
[2:10:44] you won't reach home,
[2:10:47] the lion is going to eat your carcass.
[2:10:54] Amen.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to somebody against the
[2:11:00] word.
[2:11:05] Take what the word says,
[2:11:09] not what
[2:11:12] Even if it sounds beautiful,
[2:11:17] but take what the word says.
[2:11:21] Even if what the word says is since not
[2:11:23] beautiful,
[2:11:26] it is not understandable.
[2:11:29] But take what the word says.
[2:11:33] And when this one
[2:11:35] went tries to go back,
[2:11:38] he made the lions there
[2:11:41] and they they kill him.
[2:11:44] That is the result
[2:11:46] of disobedience.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; May you together with me?
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; We have got another person here
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; that is David.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; This David
[2:12:02] he disobeyed the church order.
[2:12:08] This prophet disobeyed the word of God.
[2:12:14] But David here disobeyed the church
[2:12:17] order.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:12:24] my brother read first Chronicles.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Read uh
[2:12:33] uh verse 1 to 10.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Verse one
[2:12:40] chapter
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; chapter 13. Chapter 13
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; verse 1 to 10.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 10.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; David here
[2:12:51] received a revelation.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; It was a good revelation.
[2:12:59] That's what the prophet says. If you
[2:13:01] receive a revelation
[2:13:05] because he says it is a private
[2:13:08] revelation.
[2:13:12] He said you must take test to a pastor.
[2:13:19] Are you together with me?
[2:13:22] This David
[2:13:24] received a revelation
[2:13:27] that they have neglected the ark so
[2:13:31] long.
[2:13:34] They must go and take the ark
[2:13:38] and bring it back
[2:13:41] so that they they could consult God.
[2:13:45] It it was a good revelation.
[2:13:50] They had they must bring that eye
[2:13:54] and bring it home.
[2:13:57] But instead of doing it according to
[2:14:00] church,
[2:14:04] he called a meeting.
[2:14:09] Read it my read it my brother.
[2:14:12] 1 Chronicles chapter 13.
[2:14:16] And David consulted with the captains of
[2:14:19] thousands and hundreds and with every
[2:14:22] leader. And David said unto all the
[2:14:24] congregation of Israel, if it seemed
[2:14:27] good unto you and that it be of the Lord
[2:14:30] our God, let us send a brought unto our
[2:14:33] brethren.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Just just a little.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Are you listening church? Amen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; David
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; called a big meeting.
[2:14:48] David
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; called a big meeting.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; If read it, read it, my brother.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; And David consulted with the captains
[2:15:02] and thousands and hundreds and with
[2:15:04] every leader. And David said unto all
[2:15:07] the congregation of Israel, If it seem
[2:15:10] good unto you, and that it be of the
[2:15:13] Lord our God, let us send abroad unto
[2:15:16] our brethren everywhere that are left in
[2:15:19] all the land of Israel, and with them
[2:15:22] also to the priests and Levites, which
[2:15:25] are in the cities and suburbs, that they
[2:15:28] may gather themselves unto us.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; You see, if it seems good unto you,
[2:15:38] You meet him.
[2:15:40] If it seems good,
[2:15:44] let's take it to our brothers.
[2:15:47] What did they the meetings say?
[2:15:51] It is good.
[2:15:53] It is good.
[2:15:57] But you see, let me tell you,
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; let me tell you,
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; God called Israel
[2:16:07] as his church.
[2:16:11] He called the people of Israel,
[2:16:14] his sheep.
[2:16:17] And he called the kings of Israel
[2:16:20] as his shepherd,
[2:16:23] as pastors.
[2:16:26] He then above the pastor.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; It must always be a prophet.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; So that the the the pastor must always
[2:16:37] take from the prophet
[2:16:40] and take it to the church that is the
[2:16:43] system
[2:16:45] is God prophet pastor and church.
[2:16:51] That's why a sheep
[2:16:54] which tries to receive a revelation
[2:16:58] without the pastor,
[2:17:01] that sheep is lost.
[2:17:06] He's a lost sheep.
[2:17:11] David, there was a prophet in his time.
[2:17:17] The prophet was Nathan.
[2:17:20] Instead of consulting Nathan,
[2:17:24] he called the meeting.
[2:17:29] Amen.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; And the meeting said,
[2:17:33] "It is good.
[2:17:35] Let's go."
[2:17:37] But it was not according to church
[2:17:40] order.
[2:17:43] Because according to church
[2:17:46] because from that meeting
[2:17:49] they they start to make some input.
[2:17:56] Are you together with me? Amen. They say
[2:17:59] you see when we we bring the ark
[2:18:03] you see our God is in that ark
[2:18:08] we must respect it.
[2:18:11] We must make sure that we have got
[2:18:13] choirs
[2:18:18] so that they can sing when the ark is
[2:18:20] coming.
[2:18:22] And David said to the sers,
[2:18:28] you must saw some kind of dress.
[2:18:34] So for him
[2:18:36] so that he was going to dance with you.
[2:18:42] Then they take a a a new worker cut
[2:18:49] and there was the the input from the
[2:18:52] meeting.
[2:18:56] That's why the board knows
[2:19:00] I I I refuse anything which is not
[2:19:02] according church order.
[2:19:05] Even if it seems good,
[2:19:10] I say what? What does the church order
[2:19:11] say?
[2:19:16] What you are saying is good.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; What does the church order say?
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; It seems good.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; A new cut
[2:19:30] with people who know how to drive.
[2:19:35] with
[2:19:37] the oxen. We should know how to to to
[2:19:39] draw the
[2:19:42] you see they went there.
[2:19:45] They took the the ar of God
[2:19:48] and put it in that on that
[2:19:51] [clears throat] cut
[2:19:54] and they came back. When they were
[2:19:56] coming down there,
[2:19:59] David saw them coming. They start to
[2:20:01] sing.
[2:20:04] singing with their trumpets and
[2:20:06] whatever.
[2:20:08] It was a happy day. Sisters were dancing
[2:20:11] there.
[2:20:12] Young men were dancing there because the
[2:20:15] God was coming.
[2:20:17] David went out there with that with that
[2:20:22] garment
[2:20:24] was dancing. David
[2:20:29] dancing.
[2:20:31] dancing dancing for something which is
[2:20:34] not according to church order.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me church?
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Sometime people dance
[2:20:48] and they they dance for something
[2:20:51] which is not church
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; and they become happy.
[2:20:57] They tell one another.
[2:21:00] But that thing is not
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; when they were coming
[2:21:10] towards
[2:21:12] towards the city
[2:21:16] the the the cut tries to shift
[2:21:24] one one man there because the ark wanted
[2:21:28] to fall.
[2:21:31] He he wanted to help the not to fall.
[2:21:36] He he he he he
[2:21:38] takes his hand
[2:21:41] and put into something
[2:21:45] which is not according to church order
[2:21:48] and he died right there.
[2:21:53] Don't entertain something
[2:21:56] which is not according to church order.
[2:22:00] You will die
[2:22:06] and the result thereof
[2:22:10] is that an innocent person
[2:22:15] died
[2:22:18] because of King David.
[2:22:22] The disobedience
[2:22:24] of King David.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; According the church order was saying
[2:22:34] the ark
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; should be carried by the liver
[2:22:40] and they must carry it on their left
[2:22:43] hand.
[2:22:49] It was the heart.
[2:22:53] That is where the art must be carried.
[2:22:58] Amen. But he decided to overlook the
[2:23:02] church.
[2:23:06] He knew church
[2:23:09] but he overlook it that they cause the
[2:23:12] death of innocent person.
[2:23:18] Amen.
[2:23:22] Are you together with me?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; We mustn't do something like that.
[2:23:32] It came to his mind again.
[2:23:37] He must go and take the ark.
[2:23:40] He sent the act to another man.
[2:23:44] He thought that act will kill that man.
[2:23:49] But that make that man fruitful.
[2:23:54] He said, "No, let me take it." Sorry.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, let me take it.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; But when I take it,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; I must follow the correct order.
[2:24:09] You see David
[2:24:11] one day, he received a a revelation
[2:24:16] while sitting in his house.
[2:24:19] He look at the temple at the temple
[2:24:21] there.
[2:24:23] He said I'm sitting in a beautiful house
[2:24:27] but the ar of my God
[2:24:30] is sitting not in a beautiful house.
[2:24:34] I must try
[2:24:36] to make a beautiful house for my the ark
[2:24:38] of my lord.
[2:24:41] He was thinking of his god.
[2:24:44] It is it is the thought of a Christian.
[2:24:48] A Christian always thinks about his God.
[2:24:53] He thinks about how he can please his
[2:24:55] God.
[2:24:57] But this time, he followed the correct
[2:25:00] protocol.
[2:25:02] He went to the prophet.
[2:25:05] He didn't just go there, but he went to
[2:25:08] the prophet first to consult.
[2:25:12] [cheering] He should have done that
[2:25:14] first
[2:25:16] but firstly he didn't do like that
[2:25:19] but when he went to the prophet the
[2:25:22] prophet said you you have the right
[2:25:24] thing
[2:25:27] but God said David
[2:25:30] you must not do that even if you have
[2:25:33] got the right attitude
[2:25:36] but you must not do that your son will
[2:25:40] build me a temple
[2:25:44] What they want? Why I come here?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Why I come here? Because now he followed
[2:25:52] the proper order.
[2:25:58] You see, every one of us, we have got
[2:26:02] families.
[2:26:05] What we do in our family,
[2:26:07] what we do is up to us.
[2:26:13] But when it comes to church,
[2:26:16] it must change order.
[2:26:20] Amen. If in your family,
[2:26:23] you want to invite another pastor
[2:26:27] to your family,
[2:26:29] it's up to you.
[2:26:32] But when it comes to church here,
[2:26:35] when you want to invite the church,
[2:26:38] it must go according to church order.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; It must come through me.
[2:26:46] I am just at Zis place.
[2:26:51] At the place, there was a a great
[2:26:54] festival.
[2:26:57] The children of God were there.
[2:27:00] The children of God
[2:27:02] But I didn't know that.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; I will call the deacons
[2:27:08] what happened at this place
[2:27:12] because it's the church issue.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; But if you if it is your friends,
[2:27:22] it doesn't involve the church.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[2:27:32] We must do things
[2:27:35] according to church order church order.
[2:27:39] People will respect us
[2:27:44] [cheering]
[2:27:44] [applause]
[2:27:48] and we will God will bless us
[2:27:53] and we will go and elect our pastor
[2:27:56] peacefully.
[2:28:00] and we'll choose the correct one.
[2:28:05] [applause]
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Not not according to politics.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; This one favors this one.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; This one favors this one.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; No, that doesn't work like that. It's
[2:28:18] not. You are not conversing here.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; We we don't have people can convering
[2:28:29] for somebody.
[2:28:31] We don't we don't have people here
[2:28:34] caning for this one and this one
[2:28:37] canvasing for this one. And if I see it
[2:28:41] those people who are conversing for
[2:28:44] I will take them out.
[2:28:48] [applause]
[2:28:55] If it can come to my mind, if it can
[2:28:58] come to me
[2:29:01] that you are, this one are conversing
[2:29:03] for this one
[2:29:05] and this one can be this one.
[2:29:08] I will take your leader away.
[2:29:12] I will make them an ordinary people in
[2:29:14] the church.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; In the church
[2:29:20] so that they will never be recognized
[2:29:22] when you choose the pastor.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; This is not polit politics here.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; This is the church of God. It must go
[2:29:34] according to church order.
[2:29:40] Not that you mustn't be you mustn't rush
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; because you you want you want to get
[2:29:48] that position
[2:29:52] as fast as you can.
[2:29:55] No, no, no.
[2:29:59] [applause]
[2:30:03] You better be wishy.
[2:30:08] so that I might die
[2:30:11] when I'm dead.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; You will go on with your politics.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; But when I'm still living,
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; that one won't happen here.
[2:30:26] [applause]
[2:30:31] [cheering]
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Let me finish.
[2:30:37] We have read the scripture here
[2:30:41] talking about
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; was commanded by God
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; because the amalachites
[2:30:55] made God angry.
[2:30:59] He said you must go and destroy
[2:31:01] everything
[2:31:05] even babies.
[2:31:08] Everything
[2:31:10] you mustn't feel pity for something.
[2:31:16] Paul was carrying that mandate
[2:31:21] to destroy
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; everything.
[2:31:26] But when he was going there
[2:31:29] When they were destroying,
[2:31:32] he started to use his mind.
[2:31:36] He to use use his mind
[2:31:40] and his eyes looking at cows there,
[2:31:45] oxins,
[2:31:47] sheep,
[2:31:50] feed ones,
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; beautiful ladies.
[2:31:59] The kings
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; they were
[2:32:06] saying to
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; they were pleading with him
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; don't kill us please.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; He said I will never kill you.
[2:32:17] But God said destroy everything.
[2:32:23] But when he was going to meet
[2:32:26] Prophet Samuel,
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; he said, "I've done all what God said I
[2:32:32] must do."
[2:32:37] What a lie.
[2:32:41] I've done all what God has said I must
[2:32:43] do.
[2:32:46] What a lie.
[2:32:49] Hallelujah.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan can can blind you
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; so that you might not know that what you
[2:32:58] are doing
[2:33:01] is not according to God's plan
[2:33:05] and you will be happy
[2:33:08] doing the wrong thing.
[2:33:12] Listen to the word.
[2:33:14] When I'm preaching here, I'm bringing a
[2:33:17] mirror unto you
[2:33:21] so that you can look
[2:33:23] in the mirror
[2:33:25] and see where you are.
[2:33:30] I'm not saying this one is wrong, this
[2:33:33] one is
[2:33:35] I bring the mirror
[2:33:39] to you. Each and every one of you
[2:33:43] must look in that mirror
[2:33:46] see whether you fish correct there.
[2:33:50] If you don't fish there
[2:33:53] then try to
[2:33:55] to correct yourself.
[2:34:00] [applause]
[2:34:01] I'm here as your pastor
[2:34:04] to help you all
[2:34:09] and I will receive any complaint.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; I receive any complaint
[2:34:18] from you children of God.
[2:34:23] But you must know
[2:34:25] I'm going to channel it according to
[2:34:27] church order.
[2:34:29] church. Amen.
[2:34:32] I'm not going to channel according to a
[2:34:34] wish.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; You see, if I can do things according to
[2:34:40] how I wish,
[2:34:46] then I'm going to to to to measure
[2:34:51] this one. I'm going to treat her like
[2:34:53] this
[2:34:55] and I'm going to treat one like this.
[2:34:58] But if I do everything
[2:35:01] according to church order, I will bring
[2:35:03] everyone
[2:35:06] church order.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:11] Then when when Saul was saying they said
[2:35:14] but I I thought
[2:35:18] that I am I'm going to do a sacrifice to
[2:35:21] thank our God
[2:35:26] with this fat
[2:35:31] Samuel said
[2:35:34] this obedience
[2:35:36] is like witchcraft.
[2:35:40] If you disobey
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; you are a witch.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; That is what that is what Samuel said.
[2:35:52] He said God doesn't like that.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; He want us to follow church order.
[2:35:59] But if you do something outside
[2:36:04] not following
[2:36:06] he said here stubbornness
[2:36:10] is as iniquity as idolatry
[2:36:18] because thou hast rejected the word of
[2:36:20] the Lord.
[2:36:22] He had also rejected thee from being his
[2:36:25] king.
[2:36:28] That is the result of disobedience.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:36:35] when when he was there, what Samuel told
[2:36:39] him?
[2:36:41] &gt;&gt; God is going to take the kingdom from
[2:36:43] you.
[2:36:46] He's going to give it to someone.
[2:36:50] That is the result of disobedience.
[2:36:55] He tried to hold Samuel by the the the
[2:36:58] the government.
[2:37:03] That government was torn away.
[2:37:07] He said the way the government is speak
[2:37:12] your government is going to be torn.
[2:37:16] Whatever you do outside spoken worden
[2:37:21] they will be torn apart.
[2:37:26] Amen.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; We must be afraid.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; We must follow the word of God.
[2:37:38] God bless you.
[2:37:40] [applause]
[2:37:48] [applause] If ever I have offended you,
[2:37:54] I will uh
[2:37:57] ask for forgiveness
[2:38:02] but um you must know all of you.
[2:38:06] I'm going to stick to church.
[2:38:11] [applause]
[2:38:21] Let's close our eyes
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; as we thank him.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Might heavenly father.
[2:38:30] Thank you for
[2:38:33] this privilege. You have privileged me
[2:38:36] and my brother with
[2:38:38] standing in this holy place
[2:38:42] in the place of the man who
[2:38:46] you used in this pulpit.
[2:38:51] humbly come to you. Lord,
[2:38:54] I know as a man
[2:38:58] just like any other man,
[2:39:01] I am full of mistakes.
[2:39:04] But sometimes when I am trying to say
[2:39:08] something from you,
[2:39:10] the devil may put something which is
[2:39:13] contrary
[2:39:14] from what you wanted to place in my
[2:39:17] mouth. If there is anything which has
[2:39:20] gone out of my mind, my mouth wrongly,
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Let it not get into your children's
[2:39:26] heart,
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; let only things which
[2:39:31] are from you get into your children's
[2:39:34] house [music] because that is your
[2:39:36] purpose of leading me to stand here. Be
[2:39:39] with us as we go to our different
[2:39:42] places. [music]

[2:55:23] Gracious Lord,
[2:55:26] we again want to thank you Lord Almighty
[2:55:29] for this baptismal
[2:55:32] service.
[2:55:33] We have the two brothers here Lord of
[2:55:37] which you have touched their hearts
[2:55:41] and Lord surrendered their soul unto
[2:55:44] thee
[2:55:45] as we are about to baptize them.
[2:55:49] We pray Lord that
[2:55:52] may their minds, may their spirits,
[2:55:57] may their soul be in one accord Lord
[2:56:00] Almighty.
[2:56:03] And father you'll be the one Lord would
[2:56:05] undertake in everything Lord you're
[2:56:08] going to do here in the precious name of
[2:56:11] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:56:15] [applause]
[2:56:21] Acts chapter [music] 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:56:25] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:56:28] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:56:30] same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both
[2:56:34] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:56:37] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:56:38] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[2:56:41] rest of the apostles,
[2:56:43] men and brethren, what shall we do? Then
[2:56:46] Peter said unto them, "Repent and be
[2:56:49] baptized, every one of you, in the name
[2:56:51] of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
[2:56:53] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:56:56] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[2:56:59] you and to your children, and to all
[2:57:02] that are a far off, even as many as the
[2:57:05] Lord our God shall call.

[3:00:53] Let us pray.
[3:00:56] What can I say [music]
[3:00:59] my dear heavenly father
[3:01:03] when things are happening
[3:01:07] the way you have instructed
[3:01:11] you have said those who believe and are
[3:01:13] baptized
[3:01:16] shall be saved.
[3:01:18] I believe that with my whole heart
[3:01:22] that if they are baptized,
[3:01:25] they are saved.
[3:01:27] Especially because they are baptized
[3:01:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:01:34] because it is the only name given upon
[3:01:37] among men
[3:01:39] that by which we can be saved. Bless
[3:01:45] those who were baptized.
[3:01:48] Bless the one who were baptizing them. I
[3:01:53] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:01:56] Christ. Amen.
[3:02:00] [applause]
[3:02:04] Hallelujah.
[3:02:10] Amen.
[3:02:14] Hallelujah. [music]
[3:02:19] Maybe two songs.
[3:02:22] The second song will dismiss the church.
