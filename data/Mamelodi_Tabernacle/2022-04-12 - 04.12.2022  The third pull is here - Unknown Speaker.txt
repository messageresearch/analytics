mentioned around the globe father you're so glad that he will speak to us again this morning Hallelujah amen yes we thank you Lord thank you Lord this time this moment of your coming in Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you you may be seated and there's this I think I I was looking at something last time even no man knows even the angels of heaven but I think we have found it in the book s the Seven Seals because the prophet spoke of it that when the seventh was opened because we cross all quiet in heaven and the Hops stopped playing China amen amen and he says because the angels of heaven could not understand why because the men mood is coming back again to take his position yeah and according to this word here yeah he was positioned in the third um limo now according to this threefold revelation of God yeah did you realize that man which position was give is given for the man [Music] um um while you don't know which position somebody knows he's the third um all right amen now I I read this party which says hearing um the first was identified speaking of the foreign each I wonder if somebody can say Lord we don't know is that Thomas who said we don't know okay energy how can we know where you are going we don't know the way and the Lord said I am the way if you don't know the way it was activity I am the way the Lord said to Thomas truth amen amen so Jewel was saying to him this way is a human is in a human is is made human amen amen because Thomas said maybe he he would give him a location yeah the lord gave gave him locations the truth I am alive amen amen only these things were made flesh amen the third is properly identified identified by whom even that question can be identified by whom yeah now God made things so easier for us when they went was made flesh Helen Julie a banana he made things easier for us Arena we read in the Bible that they said they said where is can you remember the scripture foreign and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and Lord Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah had it in the ten door which was behind him amen amen they said I repeat yeah about his return He said I shall suddenly return now I repeat not we ah yeah foreign because the other two went on to um but the mission of the is one is promised us that he would return amen amen yes sir Sodom is not his ministry his ministry is to come back to the house of Abraham amen Abraham yes that's right amen so I will I will reach this party uh I think he shows in prison page 42 uh I think I will find him yes yes yeah amen it should be 42.42 now when he returned do I have the right one year okay no it's 41 41. 41 from 40 here it says set pull office Ministry the first was Healing The Sick [Music] the second to us rebuking the organizations [Music] but he's dead was when he preached to the Lord amen amen and who couldn't be saved anymore all right amen he preached to them then they there's this part yeah paragraph 219. more El paragraph from 290 but look at that one that went last level fellow there's more um you know they said where is your wife and he said but you never really he calls this one the third messenger uh we should know that we're talking about the wage then it says the Samaritan woman she was waiting for that word to materialize to be made flesh little even now uh that's why people are so confused today confused silicone because if the weight is not made freshly the remote you hear one saying this is the other one saying it should not be the knowledge of the people it should be the word made flesho that's why and they ended up with Bible schools you know if the weight is it's not made flesh is but if you are predestinated foreign foreign I know sometimes we we talk about these things everybody can say that pool second pool first pool third pool yeah [Applause] it's a man and he said what was he what kind of a Ministry did he have foreign [Music] amen not just a letter in the in the book is a remote amen the weight was made flesh destroy the prophet says people is just away you normally in Japan son you see amen summary she has had people preaching about the world but she was waiting for it to be made like today today everywhere you find preachers and amen but the conclusion yeah we were looking for the one Arena who would come and will be made dwelt among us and we saw his glory the glory of the word amen even today hey without the third pool the third pool must also be made amen this is if it is not made flesh he is the mood then we'll just be talking what is the third person it's not revealed that's why that woman when people were talking about amen I'm waiting for this scriptures ah and when it is it is made flesh then he will tell us all otherwise we are hearing nothing is the people talking about beautiful you won't know about the Third what is that the third pool or seventh seeds yes it is all right now I read that third messenger that went down the third messenger what was it kind of a Ministry he said with the elected [Applause] he knew the right place you know why they elected that's where the word will find its place amen they were elected to receive amen and to them what was taking place behind him about Sarah when he stepped oh that that that is that was the third pool in the house of yeah I think if we have a place of gathering then we need the third pool in that place fat cool in our place because without the Fed pool it's not a complete Ministry I mean without the seventh seals you're here everywhere the prophet says it is when it was revealed to the Samaritan women now in those days The Mystery of the Messiah has not been revealed one would say the Messiah is coming he said yeah but it is unlike the others she had testimony was in this manner I know that yeah others also could say the same things the difference is the prophet says we have read it last time in the book is in which book movie I won't say you are lost but I'm I'm saying okay we have read it in the book okay the future home where it says more earring let me know you are younger than me where it says was waiting for it to be made I mean you know I can quickly find the patients and page 19. the future one of the great books this woman had no representation wait let me not start here let me that way it is I'm not talking about this woman here this priest with only intellectual learning Analytics you know when Jesus would do something they would say it's a devil hey Jason because that that's what the his denomination his denomination called it is you see you can say brother brand name oh god brother Branham he's a false prophet Prophet that's what you denominated but if fella they can appear a false prophet okay for being the man of God but then your nature if your nature is against Divine Natures because that's where your nature is you don't want a prophet would put it straight you call him amen amen if you maybe one from you here would say to me brother name is a false prophet you'll be in trouble because I would say Glory the Bible says are you a true Prophet oh um amen you know okay let me read amen this priest had no representation after preaching here come around you'll hear me preaching but you want you watch as soon as we leave this place take different directions the directions foreign because we made that's right amen a predestinated person is now he is here okay amen but this little woman had nothing to present she was as filthy and dirty and she could be prostitute but notice way down in here she had a representation you come up here you see a dirty woman a prostitute but when the Lord Jesus Christ down to before the foundation and he sees this woman yes foreign picked her from before the foundation we are building amen amen we were all sinners when the Lord looked at us as we have read from that scripture God don't look at you um then he finds you that's right amen amen whoa actually I was just saying she was looking for this to be made flesh that's a revelation yeah in the beginning was the way and we were waiting for that way because when the weight is made flesh word can present itself when it is and we saw its beauty amen amen amen you know when he tells you that I have seen you before the foundation of the world that's when you see his Beauty it's beautiful and you know you are the Messiah amen amen no one I will never ever touch me like you have touched the right place amen amen so they say he keep on changing me you can't change yourself but you can't change yourself you are changed by the predestination amen working here really more I love this and she was waiting for that to be made and when it was make flesh she met that word and uh foreign happy you wish you could meet the Lord standing before but he did that only you don't know it it fell we didn't how is it okay yes sir I I'm looking at this [Music] the third yeah now the third I'm going to refer to [Music] add that day I shall know that I am in the father and you and me and I in you now death watch the face the third is say it that's not this put something in you I am the Third in the mystery of God I in you amen amen now John people but are puzzled by something here oh not knowing the prophet of God tells me foreign the that the being that will come to preach to you is amen amen because Jesus himself took the form of men of the Seed of Abraham as Abraham oh now Abraham really Abraham of the seed the Royal Sea that's why okay more if you are a seed and see this you should know the law well you should know the law the law of life [Music] in the city you plunged it out of that seat coming forth come on amen amen until it comes through the stock it takes a journey from being buried [Music] Jesus was buried up now the church changes I mean you know at the end of time and here comes the seat back again now that's why after the seven churches foreign all right amen all right let me read something but let's assume when it was all silent in heaven heaven foreign because even the son don't know you you understand because the son Jesus came in as a substitution now he's coming back again where the son is a man and when Jesus takes his place the son now comes and takes amen that's right Jesus has to go back again and as he goes back he is the almighty God he is the creator now all right amen you know yeah yeah I was reading something here I was reading something here I don't know if I will find it I mean [Music] um let me find that book how did the this pools come about pools now let us make really hurry let us go to the image you know if you don't find the image You'll Always Find a barrel
