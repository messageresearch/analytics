[25:54] okay
[25:55] let's have the scripture
[26:02] uh
[26:04] uh
[26:05] volume volume please
[26:10] Genesis chapter 14 from Verse 18 to 20.
[26:17] is
[26:22] melchized king of Salem brought forth
[26:25] Bread and Wine
[26:26] and he was the priest of the most high
[26:29] God
[26:30] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[26:33] Abram of the most high god possessor of
[26:36] Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most
[26:39] high God which have delivered thine
[26:41] enemies into thy hand and he gave him

[26:46] amen
[26:49] oh okay sir
[26:51] thank you foreign
[27:18] God bless you
[27:21] okay meanwhile I will say
[27:26] the prophet says
[27:29] the age of this now audition Church
[27:36] he would take the mask
[27:39] off
[27:42] the whole thing yeah
[27:49] and
[27:53] God bless you sir
[27:56] he would take the mask off the whole
[27:59] thing and we could see
[28:04] what a glorious thing
[28:08] because we are not for
[28:12] just
[28:14] I will I will call it a
[28:17] a short message although we don't there
[28:20] is no short message
[28:24] and
[28:27] we are looking at
[28:29] this ethio funny
[28:32] no it says this body is subject to the
[28:38] word
[28:40] [Applause]
[28:43] now we have been talking about faith in
[28:47] God
[28:49] but we are talking about
[28:51] still funny
[28:55] he says it's a body
[28:58] subject to the way
[29:03] as you all know you have read it
[29:07] where it says you have heard from your
[29:11] three or five years
[29:15] because brother Ibrahim says
[29:20] has a better hearing
[29:26] I mean so we've been talking about faith
[29:31] now we want to look at the fuel funnies
[29:35] of which he says it is subject to the
[29:39] word
[29:39] [Music]
[29:42] amen
[29:43] especially in this age
[29:47] as he has
[29:50] disclosed here
[29:52] this age of the logician church
[29:55] he would take the mask of
[30:04] for the whole thing
[30:09] and we could see the whole thing
[30:15] amen amen then we'll continue
[30:21] as Abraham Ibrahim when he was looking
[30:25] for a city
[30:27] [Music]
[30:28] and you know I'm talking to the Seed of
[30:32] Abraham
[30:33] about my training now Galatians says
[30:37] the seat of Abraham is Christ
[30:43] Amen brother Brenham says
[30:46] he says we are Christ
[30:51] meaning in Christ
[30:56] we are all called Christ accordingly
[31:00] according to the prophet
[31:04] and I believe him
[31:07] because that's the word
[31:10] that's why if it says Christ
[31:14] The Mystery of God revealed
[31:16] [Music]
[31:17] it's talking about the whole family of
[31:22] God
[31:22] [Music]
[31:25] which is the whole because he says he
[31:29] Reveals His church
[31:33] because his church is part of the
[31:35] threefold revelation
[31:40] when he is revealed
[31:43] his church is revealed
[31:46] when he died we died
[31:49] when he resurrected we resurrected with
[31:52] him when he is revealed we are revealed
[31:55] amen
[31:58] I saw that is his word according
[32:02] he says
[32:06] and
[32:08] that's eternal
[32:10] if you have eternal life
[32:19] amen
[32:21] now let's look at the theophany
[32:26] a body
[32:27] is subject to the way
[32:33] amen amen
[32:37] he speaks of how Abraham
[32:42] I'm praying I've never heard of any
[32:45] other person who met
[32:48] melchized
[32:49] [Music]
[32:52] but it's Abraham
[32:55] then the prophet says as it was
[33:00] how he met melchized again
[33:04] now another thing
[33:06] Melchizedek came to Abraham as a man
[33:09] [Music]
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:12] okay
[33:14] and then he says the same thing will
[33:18] happen at the end of time
[33:20] then if milk is a dick and met Abraham
[33:25] as a man
[33:27] Melchizedek will make the city will meet
[33:29] the Seed of Abraham as a man
[33:34] [Music]
[33:34] [Applause]
[33:37] that's why we will read and see it in
[33:39] the books here
[33:42] the prophet speaking to to us
[33:48] so we
[33:50] and we were
[33:54] who has preached to us
[33:59] it was even this morning
[34:01] having a day to come
[34:04] our preacher moving
[34:06] do you know who is our preacher
[34:10] because every preacher is preaching from
[34:13] the theater
[34:16] [Music]
[34:17] if the weight is not from the three or
[34:19] five
[34:21] then it is just a word
[34:24] but it should be from theophany
[34:29] [Music]
[34:30] amen we don't listen with ears
[34:34] we are listening with our inward men
[34:39] because the word
[34:42] is not natural
[34:45] it is
[34:55] money
[34:56] if it is natural
[34:58] it will be received by the nature
[35:01] this is what we are looking at
[35:04] amen amen and if it is eternal
[35:08] it is it will be received by eternity
[35:14] okay now I I we will just look at this
[35:21] perhaps you don't know
[35:23] [Music]
[35:27] did you know that
[35:30] there is another person in you
[35:34] [Music]
[35:36] did you know that
[35:38] he asked me that question
[35:40] he asked you that question he said did
[35:44] you know it that there is another person
[35:49] in you
[35:51] all right now I will read this
[35:57] when he met Melchizedek
[36:01] I've never heard of any other person
[36:04] meeting
[36:06] [Music]
[36:09] have you do you know of any other person
[36:17] okay
[36:20] do you only know Abraham
[36:23] yes sir and the seed
[36:30] the only
[36:32] people the only person who met milk he
[36:36] said is Abraham
[36:38] [Music]
[36:39] and his seat
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:46] even those who were not born at that
[36:48] time
[36:49] the Bible says they met milk he said in
[36:54] Abraham
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:58] they even paid the time
[37:01] in Abraham
[37:04] [Applause]
[37:07] that's why they continue paying their
[37:10] time
[37:12] oh
[37:13] because they started paying ties before
[37:16] they were born
[37:20] [Music]
[37:22] amen
[37:24] that's what I'm saying I don't know of
[37:26] any other person who has met Abel kisado
[37:32] I I only know Abraham
[37:38] because the seeds
[37:44] foreign
[37:54] [Music]
[37:54] [Applause]
[37:56] [Music]
[38:04] [Music]
[38:16] yeah
[38:17] all right
[38:20] galatian says
[38:24] it says Galatians chapter 3.
[38:29] I don't know if some people really
[38:33] read the scriptures
[38:35] one Galatians chapter 3 says
[38:43] now to Abraham and his seat where the
[38:46] promise is made
[38:50] foreign
[39:11] [Applause]
[39:13] [Music]
[39:20] Abraham and his
[39:22] foreign
[39:43] you see the difference
[39:46] all right when he met Abraham
[39:50] we met Abra we met melchized
[39:54] foreign
[40:04] [Music]
[40:16] [Music]
[40:24] that is the Hebrew Book
[40:29] the first time some years back
[40:36] I met brother
[40:40] rediff
[40:43] pastorative
[40:45] he offered me this book now since ever
[40:51] I have the books
[40:56] I
[40:59] it's from this book Hebrew
[41:02] Hebrews and page 308
[41:08] then where he says
[41:11] are you ready
[41:14] to meet him
[41:19] that's the prophet do you love him
[41:23] can you save him
[41:27] have you sold out
[41:30] to their things of the world
[41:36] have you met Melchizedek
[41:41] this is the battle was over
[41:47] all right now let's start here
[41:53] king of Salem
[41:55] amen that means Jerusalem
[42:00] that's why when
[42:02] Abraham was looking for a city
[42:05] [Music]
[42:06] and he met this King
[42:11] now brother Brennan says he met the king
[42:15] at the literal sport
[42:19] where the city will come
[42:23] amen amen and as we see
[42:27] in the last Church age
[42:30] there's a migration
[42:33] ah
[42:34] rupturing
[42:38] as we were looking at the Elijah
[42:43] when after he has seen The Chariot
[42:47] he started rupturing
[42:52] towards the chariot
[42:55] he knew that as we know the rapture
[43:01] is already around here
[43:07] sometimes we look upwards
[43:10] because the Rapture is just here with us
[43:15] all right we are all ready
[43:22] did you know that
[43:24] that the true Sons and Daughters of God
[43:32] what
[43:33] foreign
[43:34] [Music]
[43:39] I mean before he was taken
[43:43] he walked with God
[43:47] for Elijah was taken
[43:51] he walked with God
[43:53] and he was lecturing
[43:57] Beyond Jordan
[44:00] it will happen
[44:03] so he started off with Elisha
[44:07] having a rupture in faith
[44:11] I believe we have we have Rapture in
[44:14] faith
[44:15] today working with him
[44:19] amen we are not thinking of going back
[44:24] because I feel funny you will never
[44:26] think of such things
[44:30] okay
[44:31] what is in US is another person
[44:35] and that's why we are on a Runway
[44:41] oh man no matter what the world says
[44:46] okay
[44:48] now I'm going to read this pattern
[44:52] this book is a great book
[44:55] who is this
[44:59] who is

[48:27] he will appear again
[48:30] as a man
[48:32] [Applause]

[50:35] [Music]
[50:39] all right awesome

[50:52] then he asked
[50:54] have you met Melchizedek

[51:03] because Abraham met him after the battle
[51:09] now brother Brandon tells me that
[51:13] seven Church ages
[51:16] these are battles
[51:20] every Church
[51:22] is

[52:22] I don't know whether the battle of
[52:23] Armageddon is coming or has passed
[52:31] the battle of Armageddon
[52:34] was fought in heaven
[52:38] tells you that
[52:41] first thing in heaven
[52:43] [Music]
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:47] have you seen that
[52:50] he says the first thing in heaven
[52:53] was
[52:55] abandoned
[52:57] and he says
[53:00] and Satan
[53:03] and his angels were cast out
[53:08] yes
[53:10] and later he says and the Angels were
[53:15] subject to become human
[53:17] [Music]
[53:19] [Applause]
[53:21] then he says now it came down and well
[53:26] then it was in the Mind of Men
[53:31] but

[53:36] and the
[53:38] it will end up in the battle of
[53:42] Armageddon
[53:45] in heaven it says there was war in
[53:48] heaven
[53:52] but brother Brennan says it will end up
[53:56] in the battle called
[54:01] it came and he said
[54:03] from Heaven Satan cast out by Michael
[54:09] and the battle started here on Earth
[54:12] it became human
[54:14] and the battle started in the mind of
[54:17] man

[55:01] drying up
[55:03] and now they say
[55:05] it is dry
[55:09] and they are seeing things there
[55:12] because
[55:14] what did
[55:16] Revelation 12 says
[55:21] is it
[55:23] 16 12.
[55:27] Revelation 16 verse 12.
[55:30] and the sixth Angel poured out his vial
[55:33] upon the great river Euphrates and the
[55:36] water there off was dried up that the
[55:39] way of the kings of the East might be
[55:41] prepared
[55:43] foreign
[56:12] [Music]
[56:18] we are so blessed
[56:22] that God has sent us a prophet
[56:26] [Music]
[56:28] so we know
[56:31] okay
[56:33] the better
[56:34] there now we've seen people mixing these
[56:38] things
[56:40] they cannot make it out what is
[56:46] the battle of Armageddon
[56:52] now I read my Cod book
[56:59] that those
[57:01] Who has fought
[57:06] they are going to fight the best
[57:10] they'll get engaged
[57:15] God is not expecting some new people
[57:20] no the same people
[57:23] like if Karma you were defeated
[57:28] in heaven you'll continue
[57:32] [Applause]
[57:35] if you have one in heaven
[57:39] you will you'll continue to win
[57:44] now the battle of Armageddon that's why
[57:47] people don't understand
[57:49] because it would it will not be fought
[57:52] by new people
[57:54] foreign
[58:05] [Music]
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:17] did we read it
[58:19] what did it say
[58:22] s
[58:23] and the sixth Angel thought out his vial
[58:27] upon the great river Euphrates and the
[58:30] water thereof was dried up that the way
[58:33] of the kings of the East might be
[58:35] prepared amen amen
[58:39] it it is dry Brothers
[58:44] amen for the kings of the East
[58:49] to come down
[58:52] you know we were reading
[58:55] when putting
[58:57] was saying
[58:59] he are pointing at Jerusalem
[59:05] saying I wanted that Temple foreign
[59:09] because
[59:13] in these battles
[59:16] he is also Paving away
[59:20] to go to Jerusalem
[59:24] and the Bible says he will follow
[59:28] upon the mountains of brother Branham
[59:31] speaks of God
[59:32] yes upon the mountains of Jerusalem
[59:36] foreign
[59:41] yeah
[59:43] yeah meaning this it comes with some
[59:46] meanings
[59:48] the princess and his land
[59:55] no some people what uh they're looking
[59:59] at the Ukraine
[1:00:02] that's it
[1:00:04] that's God get married
[1:00:06] no it's only a sign it is it begins that
[1:00:10] way
[1:00:14] it will happen immediately
[1:00:17] after the Rapture
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:24] now if you want to take it take it from
[1:00:26] the prophet
[1:00:29] immediately after the Rapture
[1:00:35] brother do you know when
[1:00:37] is the Battle of
[1:00:40] which other people
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:45] the other battle
[1:00:47] of Armageddon you know when it will come
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:54] say it
[1:00:58] after the tribulation
[1:01:01] says that's after the tribulation
[1:01:05] then it will come
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:09] today all right
[1:01:11] the battle
[1:01:13] is because
[1:01:16] the Lord Jesus is coming
[1:01:19] to take over
[1:01:24] now that's why there's a bedroom
[1:01:28] Satan was trying to take over
[1:01:32] and Michael
[1:01:34] cast him down
[1:01:40] as you see today
[1:01:42] the Lord is coming
[1:01:44] to take over
[1:01:49] what I do we will see that
[1:01:52] it is in the spoken word
[1:01:56] let's read this
[1:02:00] song Abraham Ibrahim
[1:02:05] I will start there
[1:02:09] when Lord down in Sodom okay
[1:02:15] two of them went down there
[1:02:18] and Lord saw two of them coming
[1:02:23] and he said my laws
[1:02:29] but do you know Abraham I saw a tree
[1:02:34] but he said my Lord
[1:02:38] but the Lord said my Lord
[1:02:43] Abraham said my Lord
[1:02:48] out of those three he recognized one
[1:02:55] and this one remained with Abraham
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:00] and the two
[1:03:02] went on
[1:03:06] but the Lord remained with Abraham
[1:03:11] that's why I never said Lords
[1:03:14] he didn't recognize the other two but he
[1:03:19] recognized this one
[1:03:21] you know today there's so many messages
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:33] all right
[1:03:34] to be the message
[1:03:39] he says Lord was not a prophet
[1:03:44] that's right or neither was a messenger
[1:03:52] so he didn't have any revelation of him
[1:03:58] revelation of him
[1:04:02] that's why today we need a prophet
[1:04:06] ah whom God can speak to
[1:04:11] you that's why we no only love one
[1:04:14] prophet
[1:04:17] okay because we are part we are part of
[1:04:20] that profession
[1:04:23] Lord could call them Lords
[1:04:28] a dozen of them says
[1:04:30] but no matter how many Abrahams saw
[1:04:35] it was still one Lord
[1:04:38] [Applause]
[1:04:41] yes
[1:04:47] yes amen notice after the battle was
[1:04:50] over
[1:04:52] Melchizedek saved his Victorious child
[1:04:58] communion
[1:05:02] think of that part of himself
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:13] right part of himself
[1:05:17] Bread and Wine
[1:05:19] and we see it in John 6. the Lord says
[1:05:25] except you drink the blood of the son of
[1:05:29] man
[1:05:30] and it's the body
[1:05:34] you have no life
[1:05:39] he was talking to the people
[1:05:42] who could who could maybe try to prove
[1:05:45] to him
[1:05:48] breathing and jumping and say why you
[1:05:51] say we don't we don't have life
[1:05:58] you have no life
[1:06:02] and they could say Can't You See Me
[1:06:07] but to him that is not life
[1:06:09] because he is
[1:06:15] any other movement
[1:06:17] foreign
[1:06:30] [Applause]
[1:06:47] he used here in in John 14.
[1:06:54] let me
[1:06:56] find out
[1:06:58] I tried it somewhere but it didn't work
[1:07:01] for me
[1:07:04] um
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:14] okay
[1:07:16] let us start
[1:07:20] he says
[1:07:25] victory and if I go and prepare a place
[1:07:30] for you I will come again and receive
[1:07:33] you unto myself that where I am there
[1:07:37] you may be also
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:48] and where I go you know you know
[1:07:52] and the way you know
[1:08:02] did you see did you hear him he's not
[1:08:07] asking them questions
[1:08:10] because he is talking to a three of our
[1:08:13] new year
[1:08:16] I go you know
[1:08:19] and the way you know
[1:08:23] and Thomas said no no Lord
[1:08:28] we know not
[1:08:30] without going
[1:08:32] and how can we know
[1:08:36] the way
[1:08:38] amen amen
[1:08:40] it was Thomas
[1:08:44] the natural one
[1:08:47] Jesus said unto him
[1:08:50] I am the way
[1:08:54] now you what she doesn't say I have
[1:08:57] foreign
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:35] you you should have known my father
[1:09:39] it takes you again to a three-fold
[1:09:42] also
[1:09:45] and from henceforth
[1:09:47] you know him number two
[1:09:50] and have seen him now he was not talking
[1:09:55] to a natural Thomas
[1:09:59] because the national Thomas would not
[1:10:03] know
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] that's why the seventh seal
[1:10:10] is not to a natural brother
[1:10:15] no
[1:10:17] there's somebody in you he was talking
[1:10:21] to somebody
[1:10:23] behind the natural Thomas
[1:10:29] naturally he would not know
[1:10:34] but then he says you know
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:40] and Thomas says we don't know
[1:10:43] what do we
[1:10:45] now he's not talking to this Thomas he's
[1:10:47] facing
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:56] let's read
[1:10:59] this
[1:11:04] or you don't know brother
[1:11:07] if he had known me
[1:11:11] you should have known my father also
[1:11:16] now are you listening to the language
[1:11:19] from henceforth you know him
[1:11:25] it seems as if he is forcing
[1:11:29] on them they say we don't know he says
[1:11:32] you know
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:39] from Hillsborough

[1:11:44] and have seen him
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:50] he's talking to somebody here
[1:11:57] you know that book
[1:12:00] it says the back
[1:12:03] the back
[1:12:06] say it brother
[1:12:08] the back side of the book you met down
[1:12:13] now he's talking to the backside of
[1:12:15] Thomas so
[1:12:20] because the Thomas that is standing
[1:12:22] before him
[1:12:24] he's scratching his head
[1:12:26] but he's talking to the back side
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:35] okay
[1:12:37] verse
[1:12:40] eight
[1:12:42] Phillip
[1:12:44] was listening also
[1:12:47] he he came in also
[1:12:51] all right show us the father
[1:12:56] [Applause]
[1:12:59] hey it was a big meeting here
[1:13:04] the Lord addressing the people
[1:13:08] but took him to the back side
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:14] of the same people
[1:13:18] before then why foreign
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:50] Lord me also
[1:13:53] many people I've got a question for you
[1:13:54] here
[1:13:57] show us the father
[1:14:02] and it sufficient us
[1:14:06] amen amen we want to prove yeah we want
[1:14:13] he was listening all the time
[1:14:15] amen amen then Jesus said unto him
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:21] have I been so long time with you
[1:14:26] has thou not known me
[1:14:31] he that has seen me has seen the father
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:40] and the house says
[1:14:42] show us the father
[1:14:46] hey it was a battle here
[1:14:51] he was talking to the back side
[1:14:54] Believers now
[1:14:56] Believers now not that I am in the
[1:14:59] father
[1:15:02] and the father in me
[1:15:06] but he didn't continue to say an eye in
[1:15:09] you
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] he was still supposed to go to Golgotha
[1:15:19] the ways that I speak unto you
[1:15:22] I speak not of myself
[1:15:26] but the father that dwelleth in me
[1:15:28] foreign
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:40] because he told them
[1:15:43] you have seen him
[1:15:46] but the Holy Ghost had not come here
[1:15:50] let's see it so they could they couldn't
[1:15:54] recognize
[1:15:58] that's why when it is revealed it says
[1:16:08] foreign
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:46] so
[1:16:49] it was still running
[1:16:52] to accomplish the threefold Revelation
[1:16:58] because they couldn't know him
[1:17:02] because it was still a twofold
[1:17:08] amen
[1:17:10] that's why he said
[1:17:12] to the Jews I and my father
[1:17:15] he never said he never continued
[1:17:19] I I and my father
[1:17:22] R1
[1:17:25] amen so
[1:17:28] it's supposed to be
[1:17:34] that's why I say his father Son and Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost
[1:17:38] amen but with the Jews
[1:17:46] the Gentiles were not yet
[1:17:50] amen then when the Gentiles
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] foreign
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:29] on floor
[1:18:34] if he speaks
[1:18:36] it will run through the three fours
[1:18:44] okay that's what he saw
[1:18:47] [Music]
[1:18:50] here again
[1:18:52] I remember one day
[1:18:58] John 4 tells us of this
[1:19:04] who was this woman
[1:19:08] the summer written yeah
[1:19:13] she met the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] she came for water
[1:19:21] verse 7 here
[1:19:24] give me to drink
[1:19:28] to the woman
[1:19:32] for his disciples were gone
[1:19:34] away
[1:19:36] and to the city to buy yeah
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:43] when the Jews went into the city
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:53] God knew how to
[1:19:55] separate them
[1:20:01] for these disciples who had gone away
[1:20:06] somewhere of Summer here unto him how is
[1:20:10] it that being a Jew asked drink of me
[1:20:14] which am a woman of Samaria
[1:20:23] for the Jews have no dealings with their
[1:20:26] Samaritans
[1:20:29] and Jesus answered Satan to her
[1:20:32] if thou knoweth the gift of God
[1:20:38] and who it is that said today give me to
[1:20:43] drink ask
[1:20:49] of him
[1:20:52] and he would have given the Living Water
[1:20:57] [Music]

[1:25:53] he gave off himself
[1:25:58] I don't know if we we are together here
[1:26:02] he gave Abraham
[1:26:05] of himself
[1:26:10] part of himself

[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:19] and after the struggle is over
[1:26:23] that is after the struggle is over

[1:46:48] that's why the prophet says do you love
[1:46:51] him company
[1:46:54] can you save him
[1:46:56] I could never
[1:46:59] have you sold out to the things of the
[1:47:01] world
