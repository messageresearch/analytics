and Savior Jesus Christ a Rel Amen brother he actually found a relever today amen we are thankful brother yes we to the service God bless you my brother all right amen we are also happy for pastor and he prayed that I should continue God bless I also trust at home [Music] well God has provided someone there amen amen now as for me it has been weeks away from my I don't even recall how many three or two or what I don't know if we should say you should be happy that it's four or what okay amen um now when you were there at it was a big fight that I had to go to Mal it was between the malawians and Pastor the Mal said no everything is finished the pastors are coming the stadium prepared you local you can be see later amen okay now another Pastor there down in California has called that area you just get scared by the trip itself to get to California now they said the service is going to be at a place where brother B preached were trying to see how we can dodge this one BR preached saying that we have to go to the place where the Prophet preached I was said to the brother do you hear what the old man says where the Prophet pre Philipp let's open the scripture from the Philippians okay Philippi H chapter uh chapter 2 verse 5 Philippians 2 verse 5 11 to 11 Philippi chapter 2 verse 5 to 11 amen am [Music] amen amen amen 11 joh 14 verse 20 to 20 to 23 John 14 20 to 23 for [Music] [Music] Philippians John 14 20-24 at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that ha my Commandments and keepeth them he he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not is scariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the we and Jesus answered said unto him if a man love me he will keep my weights and my father will love him and I will come unto him and make him our aboard with him [Music] for expect amen amen we may take your SE God bless you and well um we we are going to read the word of God the one that people used to say is dangerous this message we preach is a dangerous message amen now we thank God that in all the things that he has done for us [Music] okay me and my brother will just and uh so um he's a a brother [Music] I've known since ever he worked for what was it magistrate neor neor amen amen amen he was still a young man unmarried amen and uh so we thank God today Hallelujah uh God is now being saved by The Offspring amen okay so uh we we I sometimes we think that this is the last message from God then we wonder again next time there is another service now the prophet says he spoke of the last sheep and he spoke also of something here maybe I will find it if I can page uh where he says um if the church only knew its position and he says it will one day then the Rapture will go so um this is uh keeping our time or it's our time piece if the church only knew its position amen am uh now sometimes we go out or to evangelize uh and but yet we should know our position amen amen we we we should know who we are where we are where are we going where we came from amen amen so if the church H only knew is position and the Rapture will go so um what's keeping the Rapture not to go it's something um in the bride of Christ okay amen let me read to you what I'm going to speak of uh the prophet says now all right let me start by reading this part we are we are we are just going briefly to talk about something here um I'm glad I believe a brother was introduced this morning and uh the brother who came and said said I want to serve my God now and I've been away because you know if you are a child of God uh you can go very far but God will still restore you amen amen so that's why we as the children of God we judge no [Music] man the judge is God uh if somebody comes and say I'm sick we don't ask him questions where do you worship there's a mother I don't know if I don't think she's here she she came yesterday was with brother and uh she was the last person to to see us last night um and she said she's got a neck problem and our Deon knows about it so I said said you are I said you are a a Pentecostal and he said yes and she she she she prayed for her condition so I pray for her amen amen because in praying for the sick uh you don't pray for somebody who is with you in the faith you don't only pray for that particular person because he's with you in the you pray for everybody amen amen so and a prayer of faith but I'm glad I don't know if this mama that Mama is here but when she left then she she she she she turned this way and that way amen amen said God bless you m amen amen um so there is power in the word brother says the word of God is your healer amen amen then there was another sister yesterday H she came and uh I as brother I W reveal the sister I don't know if she's in or not but she promised that if she can find her way she'll be here but so I said to brother I want you to take a photo of my sister here saw that uh you as a witness uh tomorrow you'll be able to testify that we prayed for this sister in such a condition and today she is in this condition I said because we have prayed for so many people with some kind of diseases and people don't know the conditions the people were found to be and they are today perect and there's no witness to that so this day we need to have a witness every time just as brother bam did amen amen so uh God bless you this is what I'm trying to talk about God dwells in the sture of a man now let me read it to you because you know uh before you can worship God you should know who he is and where he is because if you don't know where God is you can just bow on your knees [Music] anywhere and that's why the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan you worship but you don't know why because salvation is of the Jews so that means they worship in vain but he said but now the time has come and the true worshippers shall worship God not upon that mountain not in Jerusalem but they worship God in spirit amen amen so here it says here I I'm it's a quotation from the stature of a perfect man from the St of the perfect man amen amen now a perfect man brother says as we were taught that Perfection is in three three is the number of perfection then in my Hebrew Book I don't have he says life is in the thir [Music] amen amen then he goes to book of Genesis chapter 1 he says chapter I mean that is verse three h he speaks of how God coming down separating water from water Darkness from light then finally he reached the dry ground and he said let the Earth bring forth and uh so uh he quotes also verse 11 yeah that is verse 11 and it says let every tree or plant bring forth of its kind amen amen so uh that that's life coming down but let me read this thing because he says [Music] um how he puts it this he puts it this way that the seed was in the earth amen but it was not yet called but it was already there you see amen and it is in your book I don't have it but I will qu it if you read Genesis uh he speaks of this here and chapter one I'll have you okay just hold on chapter one chapter one now uh verse 11 verse 11 he it says and God said let the Earth bring forth vegetations they have yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was s [Music] amen amen so now the prophet says because the seeds were were already there the SE was already there it was only waiting for the time of it calling amen amen so h but the title I want to give please you write the thing that I'm going to read okay H I will read two things here one says God dwells in the nature in the stature of a man that's one number one and I have one part also to read to you all right I think it's somewhere here uh uh uh all right amen I've got it here with me yeah here you are God dwells in the sture of a man then this one says that is cod page 1 page now if if we can find out what God is we can find what kind of man he has made all right amen now in the book of adoption there he says uh everything will come back to be Jesus again amen amen now let me just quote these things to you because the Bible say here say and verse 8 verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man amen amen uh verse S he says but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men am verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man verse verse eight says verse S okay okay maybe verses don't correspond I don't know okay amen all right amen we just trying to lay the amen this old man when he starts in the morning he says I lay the carpet he first starts with the POR then when he gets to work that's when we are trying toay he was found to be in F of a man amen amen H then more I come down he was a man it start by [Music] saying God is a man then I repeat see God is a man so therefore it proves it when God came down to dwell among us he was a man God dwells in the St of that means H when he came down and uh when he reached us he was a man [Applause] that's why even in the end time we have the seventh angel messenger when the seals reached us it was a man amen amen when God reach Phillip then he was a man so now there why you will realize that many people could not accept or believe him because they had a certain mentality about God so when he reached them he was a man okay Amen in this way uh um and they don't love him when he becomes they just want him to be a God uh a god they can worship without even knowing where he is but when he embodied himself then this is the thing they don't like amen [Music] amen let Meo it I was told that even yesterday they didn't want me to come there to the dedicational service amen amen but I said to the brother they can't stop me okay so uh let me read you another thing here um yeah I'm I'm on a ghost low but not a strike not striking amen the the the the people the Jesus was masked to these Greeks amen amen so when they come to him he was mask and and they couldn't understand why that they couldn't see him because they came thinking that God would be this or that but only when they arrived there stood a man this is the unveiling of God page 17 Page 1 they come to see God they've seen a man what do they come for to see God disappointed saying I'm coming to see God must it will be such a great and when you got there you find aen amen amen hallelujah they they disappointed the Jews very it disappointed the Jews because uh they always thought themselves to be the children of the promise and they thought they would see God but when God arrived on the seene he was a man that that that was the the that's where the whole trouble problem started we want to see God not a man this je thought like that then you read John 6 John where he says I'm a bread from heaven and they were around him there but uh after making that state said listen to him now amen I'm the bread from then let me read it for you we are not in h is there anyone who's going to Church in the P so much he just come to church and say brothers and sisters hallelujah our national team is playing today they need our support and our prayers amen amen amen hallelujah say Amen then he open the scriptures because in his mind there is so he will just read for the sake of reading and say Jesus loved the world and he also loved the footballer then 15 minutes 15 minutes let us pray so that the people can get chance to see amen amen then when the Sun goes down the people are sick because has lost after his prayers okay amen so God bless you now here we are h i I will read this part that is John chapter 6 Johan 6 [Music] um verse 38 verse 38 I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me amen amen and uh H verse verse 41 I'm going to verse 4 the Jews then mured at him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven all right amen he was Healing The Sick they were following him but declaration now when the Declaration came the Bible says no man has seen God at any time but only the begotten amen amen he saw Here I Am from heaven then they mured at him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he said I came down from heaven amen amen and Jesus therefore answered and said unto them remember not among yourself no man can come to me amen amen uh he showed them the distance they've been there around but they couldn't come to him it is just like if you are in this place physically phally amen amen and yet you at the end of it all you have failed to come to God you were just here in the vinity amen amen but you never went further and reach God the reason been that man is triti H now inside of you there is it's a bodyside the spirit the soul amen amen now inside of you uh there is a way from your mind down to your soul that's how you can travel amen amen and now to reach God you've got to travel as the prophet says you come it comes down the mind when the word of God comes to you and the mind catches but it has to go down to the soul amen amen when it is in the mind it is theology you can't go further that's where theology is coming from that's where denomination is coming from the word of God stops in the then you start to think don't understand this one I won't take I'll take this one that is in the mind but once it drops in uh I've got a book here I can read it quickly once it drops in then it's something different or okay if I don't have it here no problem I will qu it to you amen amen so now you see these things as we are carrying on reading H the prophet speaks of this that okay Amen Let Me Maybe it's around here I I'll catch it quickly amen he speaks of these things how it's coming down your mind to your soul yeah it's something here amen okay uh I will read it where let me find the the position or the the page am which I don't remember in which page okay are we together Hallelujah all right it's a marked page I will find it I think amen your faith here in this in this book your faith I won't surrender I'll find it yeah he says um I could preach the word you could accept it and say that's all right I believe that well if that's all the further it ever goes then you'll never get very far with God you hear the message and you say I believe it but if is the further it can go he says you won't go far with God why because it's not just to say I believe it it's for the way to to be made manifest amen amen by just saying I believe you won't go far with God amen amen like what I said last night ifuse say I say to you do believe that there is communion and the Lord supper and you say sure amen but if you don't partake so you don't go far with God why because that word must be manifested and brother Bram says we know that is the word of God manifestation it's when that way is is f is being fulfilled it's manifested Amen so it's not just to say I believe it but is to leave it to act it become that way amen amen then you are with God because God said let there be light and they were was light so if he say something and you do it so you are you are together with God but if you just believe it you are not together with him you just believe amen amen so here we are uh it says then you'll never get very far with God it's intellectual Faith that's the reason people doesn't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it amen amen Jesus heals but it should be made be manifested amen if you come here and say I'm sick and you believe that Jesus saves now you must come here to accept that healing if you believe that H he heals the sick now you must come and manifest it amen you know uh one day we I prayed for a a sister from so she was brought to my house she couldn't walk and told me that she was Bewitched by her aunt something like that okay they help her walked her into my house now I said to her now I'm going to preach for you to pray for you if you believe you'll be healed if you can believe because I believe now you also Must Believe amen amen then why why was talking H she asked for the restroom and uh I I could see that she was managed to stand up on herself but the husband still mindful of yes and uh he he tried to to hold her and I said no just leave here but anyhow he insisted because that thing was still that if he she can try to do it she will drop down so I have to help so I just left them like that by the time we finished I prayed for her and as they walked out she could walk amen amen now the thing is before I prayed for her already she was healed why she believed the word I I spoke to her the healer is the word for [Music]
