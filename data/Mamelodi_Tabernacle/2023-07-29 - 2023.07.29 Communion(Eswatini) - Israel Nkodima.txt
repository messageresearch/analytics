Description:
Title: Communion Service
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-July 29 at eSwatini.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Matthews 26: 26 -29 John 4: 29, 39-42
The prophet when he was speaking about the Rapture, he said potentially the rapture is in you.  We can talk about the rapturing faith because the rapture is there in you.
The problem today is the people who talk to God, who in turn God doesn't talk to them. I believe that the God whom we worship, is the God whom we can commune with and he in turn can commune with us.
You hear Him when He speaks to you. When I speak to Him I wait on to reply. Don't preach if He hasn't spoken to you, because preaching is not just repeating things but it is continuity.
It is not just a church tradition, but it should be life. When we come to the service we come to hear all things. 
You must worship the God who can tell you all things that you have done. God who can tell you about the battle of Armageddon, who can tell you about the Rapture, tell you about the time that is coming and about what is happening now. We must hear Him and follow Him.
If you have heard Him. He is the one who is serving communion tonight. For we have heard Him and He told us all things.  The real children of God are the blood of God.

just before the reading of the word eaten foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] please try daddy amen amen where will you spend with it the song is asking amen amen what gives me joy is that where will you spend eternity corner yes we are already we are already there you know when speaking about the rapture when he was speaking about the Rapture he said potentially the Rapture is already in you [Applause] so that we can just be talking about the rapturing faith yeah we are just talking about the rapturing faith because the Rapture already is there in you [Applause] to ask God for his presence with us again this evening for the few minutes we will spend here we will spend with him you know to spend with him he is our eternity one second with him [Applause] to me is eternity it's a question where will you spend eternity we worship Him in eternity [Applause] we believe him in eternity amen now as we bow our heads for a prayer just for the blessing upon the word we are about to partake of God bless you this is [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] we have to know and um [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign God bless you all hello and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take it this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink eat all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine and to that day when I drink it noon with him in my father's Kingdom 26 26-29 which is foreign [Applause] let's take this opportunity as I read from the book of communion itself the prophet says but if you are in agreement then you can commune so that's the way it is when we come to the Lords table s that's mean we that will mean we are in agreement and now he says I would like to apply to explain for a little while we take what we call communion is the bread and the wine now that has been misinterpreted okay [Music] it's not even good to speak of it amen because it has been misinterpreted that has been misinterpreted a misrepresented I read um [Music] okay now we want to to thank the Lord today because all these things were misinterpreted before [Music] Elijah the prophet appeared on the scene according to the scriptures for he shall turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers that's why Paul one day is speaking he spoke of for he said he spoke of the Lord he says it is the god let me repeat his words he says it is the god whom he serve from his forefathers [Music] so I just called the prophet before we proceed yeah communion is I read the book of communion here page 11 communion is to talk to talk to you says I mean community is talking about the word commune let it see is to talk to talk to commune with something that you can speak to and it will speak back to you [Music] um you know the problem today it's when the people speak to God who intent do not speak to them [Applause] amen I believe we know even tonight the god whom we worship is the god whom we can commune with [Applause] you can commune with us God that is the true worship foreign [Applause] I speak to and in turn he speaks to me hey [Applause] you talk to him he also speaks to you hmm and you know this is the end time you hear him when he speaks to you [Applause] I don't know about you I don't know about you when I speak to him I wait for him to speak to me [Applause] [Music] and we were talking as we were coming this way [Applause] and it is only yesterday when I stood up and said now I've got the answer [Applause] Don't Preach if he hasn't spoken to you [Applause] because a preaching is not just to repeat things it's continuity happy like now you know somebody said they were talking to me well as I was told that somebody has taken the pulpit back to brother Brennan foreign it's not according to the scriptures nothing because foreign ministers when I passed away these people will take the message foreign [Applause] yes this is you know I'm not preaching but yesterday I was talking to the brothers on our way coming here that uh they are talking about things that are happening now politically and and they are warning the Christians it is coming to you amen and meaning that the tribulation period is coming to you amen amen and then now but we have a message on that we will look at that but this is just for communion here he says what's he I'm reading the last part of it and then we take communion he says commune is to talk to to commune with something that you can speak to and it will speak back to you communication amen that's why before we used to use like a cold drink and so could drink could drink and what else and bread and all that um we used to do that now that was not communion of the Lord to commune is to talk to is to talk to um to commune with something that that's what we are here for tonight foreign [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] later [Applause] tonight is just for this communion here numbers and it says that's communion I'm trying to say to you this is what we have come for amen and he says a way a wafer that's what they use at the Catholic Church cannot speak back [Music] the real communion is the holy spirit speaking back [Applause] right like like as we think communion like this [Applause] [Applause] when you ask him then he speaks back I want to serve God who can speak back to me not that I just I'm just speaking speaking speaking they brought somebody to my house they brought somebody to my house a woman she couldn't walk or always two weeks back about two weeks back and I even asked some brothers who were with us to go and help to carry the woman into my house [Applause] so me and then so we went to attend so minutes and uh she she couldn't walk and it was hard for heaven to stand up [Applause] [Laughter] because the brother of the sister has returned to fetch her foreign [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] we went to pray for him [Applause] and said God will do the rest foreign [Music] said he opened the seventh seal and God opened the Seven Seals but he never said anything [Applause] then he said but he opened it but just about his coming or his appearing at the end something will happen there [Applause] that means God will answer will give the answer I'll tell you that we've got that answer now let me just finish here and we self communion the prophet speaks about the correct wonder the correct communion I am reading from a book uh is to talk to somebody [Applause] who in 10 will talk back to you our way it's not just a church tradition it should be life for life amen amen you know uh the woman the Samaritan woman I was just reading here let me just check the last part here she was she was talking to some people yeah yeah yeah firstly that is John The Book of John here [Applause] and let me let's see where to start because I'm not preaching I'm just looking at the Book of John chapter 4 here foreign verse 29 verse 29. [Music] okay she knew that well when Christ comes he will tell her all things [Applause] when he comes he's coming to tell her all things when we come to the service we come in order to hear all things [Applause] all right amen you'll see we will look at these things we are at the end now I can ask somebody are you at the end yes have you heard about the battle of Armageddon Academy have you heard about it [Applause] all right yes do you know what it is yeah you know when it will happen [Applause] have you heard about God and Magog [Applause] you know that it is coming and do you know when now [Applause] I'm trying to read this come and see amen which told me all things that ever I did [Applause] it's not this the Christina amen all right meaning that there are some things that you did but no man could tell you about those things because man has not seen you doing that yeah no man has seen you doing the things you have done but yeah comes amen and and she now testimony yeah come and see amen which told me all things that ever I don't understand it all right before I stop you you've done things I have done things who knows about the things that you have done all right [Applause] people are here and we all have done things but who knows about the things that we have done even today who knows about the things that we have done today [Applause] now this woman she was waiting for somebody who has registered her life who has registered her life amen [Applause] this is the one we are coming to worship here he knows what I have done you must worship the one who knows what you have done foreign [Applause] who can tell me about the rapture [Applause] the man who will tell me all things [Applause] about the time that is coming now about what is happening now [Applause] ah man all right amen you you listen to this now yeah now I'm I will end up here yeah then the summer writtens of that City foreign [Applause] believed on him that is verse 39. uh for the saying of the woman amen amen he hasn't said anything to them and he hasn't said anything to them [Music] they believe on him for the saying of the woman not him they haven't had him [Applause] they have only had this woman speaking to them now they say which this woman which testified foreign she said he told me all that ever I did what is then they believed this woman for the testing for for her testimony but the woman testified of herself yeah he told me all things that I did [Applause] but he has India told them about their things [Applause] the testimony of this woman was a personal thing he told me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] about the things all that I ever did [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but he has not told them about their things okay so when the summer written Samaritans were coming unto him [Applause] they besought him that he would tarry with them that is verse 40. so when the summer written will come unto him amen now it's from The Testament of the woman to him now [Applause] they besold him that he would tarry with them and he about their two days [Music] [Applause] he carried he Abode there two days no he abood there two days two days amen and now many more believed because of his own weight [Laughter] [Applause] they believe the testimony of the woman but they haven't had him speak until when they were in his presence and they had him themselves many believed now it says 41 because of his own word we must hear his own [Applause] um said unto the woman now We Believe [Applause] amen amen now we are going to self communion language they say we need these things the day you have you have heard things I mean you have heard things but we we need to come to that day and when when we can say corner now imagine we believe everybody not because I woke up of somebody else saying for we have heard him ourselves [Applause] we used to be served a wrong communion [Applause] but today we have come for them we have now come for there for which communion now the right communion amen amen why because now it's himself now we have we have received it from himself [Applause] [Music] and they say and now we know that this is indeed the Christ [Applause] the savior of the world now after I have read this then I said nothing now we have I have heard him self not myself myself let me read it we believed because we have heard him ourselves now I had him he had him myself now I have heard him myself now that's why since I have heard him for me I have started to serve the right communion [Applause] and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world [Applause] they are talking outside they say brother name is a false prophet amen but it is Who convinced me that he is God's messenger [Applause] if you would faith I will send you Elijah the prophet [Applause] now if he says behold I will send you um he specifies if somebody says somebody says I don't believe that Prophet no he's right God never spoke to him anything [Applause] to you he said be you I will send you not to you but you I will send you Elijah the prophet you will receive that Elijah the prophet because I send it to you not to him [Applause] all right amen it depends we have a good thing [Applause] and who is hearing him God bless you we are going to serve communion here because now we have received the right one [Applause] we have heard him ourselves [Applause] now if we have hit him ourselves he is the one who is serving the communion tonight [Applause] we have heard him since we he told us all things we don't need to hear from somebody else because he told us all things you know sometimes the people come and say that one says so that one says and the answer is you should hear from him not from that one [Applause] hear him follow him God bless you [Applause] let us serve the communion I believe that again it's him who served us this communion Brandon we are going to have oh everything is now we are going to take part then the Bible says if you know if you are condemned by the word of God um don't cry don't take don't take it but the Bible comes again and says if you don't take it what the what does the Bible says what happens if you don't
