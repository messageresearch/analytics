[20:59] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[21:02] said on the throne a book written within
[21:04] and on the back side
[21:06] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[21:09] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[21:12] voice
[21:13] who is worthy to open the book and to
[21:16] lose the souls thereof and no man in
[21:19] Heaven Nor in F neither under the F was
[21:22] able to open the book neither to look
[21:25] there on Amen amen and I wept much
[21:27] because no man was found waiting to open
[21:30] and to read the book neither to look
[21:33] there on and one of the elders said unto
[21:36] me whip node Behold The Lion of the
[21:39] tribe of Judah the root of David have
[21:42] prevailed to open the book and to lose
[21:44] the seven Souls thereof
[21:47] number six
[21:48] and I be held in law in the midst of the
[21:51] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[21:53] midst of the elders stood a lamp as it
[21:56] had been slain having seven hongs and
[21:59] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[22:01] of God sent forth into all the Earth uh
[22:06] that book was written
[22:08] in which we
[22:10] feel sorry
[22:12] and on the back side Le camo sealed with

[49:59] human form
[50:02] he's Young

[50:34] last night
[50:36] I don't know we we were
[50:40] after the funeral and all that
[50:44] we went home to start again for a uh
[50:50] over time
[50:57] I enjoy the word of God better when it
[51:01] is a After Time
[51:14] I take sleep
[51:16] and put it aside
[51:19] oh I mean
[51:21] then I continue the word of God
[51:27] I don't know maybe the brother will know
[51:30] we were getting to bed late yeah
[51:34] foreign
[52:23] there are things
[52:26] the people
[52:28] whether they are a message Believers or
[52:32] so forth
[52:36] but there's a standard set by God
[52:43] now this standard you understand that
[52:45] you say is from before the foundation
[52:48] [Music]
[52:52] been to Eternity
[52:56] because the Eternal being
[53:01] have got no beginning
[53:06] they are without beginnings
[53:15] yes that is
[53:21] facility
[53:30] [Music]
[53:32] amen
[53:34] all right now let us look
[53:39] I moved the brother here amen
[53:45] which one is this
[53:47] okay no problem now the book says
[53:55] the book
[53:57] was sealed with on the back side
[54:05] Ashley
[54:10] now what we were looking at
[54:14] what we were looking at
[54:17] last time even in Port Elizabeth
[54:30] that's why you see
[54:32] the Seed of Abraham
[54:36] amen
[54:39] is Ageless
[54:44] that's the Seed of Abraham
[54:48] that's why when Sarah was old
[54:54] and uh
[54:56] then God came
[54:59] you know she was old what about your
[55:01] face
[55:02] why
[55:08] because
[55:11] God acted on the back side
[55:18] 11.
[55:27] uh
[55:31] and the chapter 11 chapter 8 read let me
[55:36] hear but which one are you referring to
[55:39] Hebrews chapter 11 from verse 11
[55:42] through faith also Sarah herself
[55:44] receives strength to conceive seed and
[55:47] was delivered of a child when she was
[55:49] past age amen because she judged him
[55:52] faithful who have promised amen amen
[56:00] that even in my old age
[56:03] I can still have a baby
[56:07] [Music]
[56:09] is her faith was the faith of Abraham
[56:15] because it says
[56:27] yeah
[56:30] but referring to Abraham it says by
[56:34] faith
[56:38] now Sarah the wives
[56:42] it says through
[56:44] meaning through the faith
[56:50] [Music]
[56:52] as we are operating through the face of
[56:54] Abraham
[57:00] I mean
[57:02] okay amen no jolly
[57:06] it says
[57:09] yet inhale
[57:11] old the Bible doesn't hide that be
[57:15] really
[57:16] inhale all day
[57:23] if it says old age
[57:30] but yet
[57:31] Faith the faith in here was not only
[57:34] amen
[57:38] I mean it changed her into a young woman
[57:46] because
[57:49] he was coming through the predestination
[57:56] uh
[57:58] last night I was reading
[58:01] where
[58:03] brother problems
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] talking about sister Hetty
[58:12] and uh
[58:14] he reached where the Bible says
[58:17] if you say you can say to that mountain
[58:20] move
[58:24] if it is by faith
[58:27] you can say that
[58:30] and he says
[58:33] when he needed a squirrel
[58:39] foreign
[58:55] now where there is no squares
[58:59] he believed in creation yeah
[59:07] somebody has said
[59:10] like the brother in Port Elizabeth
[59:19] and the brother was hit by a stroke
[59:25] when I was talking about sisters
[59:34] because I understand his mouth went
[59:36] skills
[59:40] but when he believed that well
[59:46] everything was true
[59:50] amen amen
[59:52] [Applause]
[59:53] it was not me it is
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:02] and I've seen many things happening
[1:00:06] with the people come out
[1:00:09] who have faith
[1:00:11] nothing Brothers
[1:00:18] although God said
[1:00:21] to the prophet
[1:00:24] make the people to believe
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:30] not meaning to believe him as God
[1:00:34] but to believe he if he says
[1:00:38] by faith if you believe how would you
[1:00:42] man God has healed you
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:48] as you know I can't heal you
[1:00:51] I believe in a God who can heal you
[1:00:57] I will encourage you
[1:01:00] God who can heal you
[1:01:04] and if you believe
[1:01:13] healing I've seen many people
[1:01:19] I can refer to one in Swaziland
[1:01:25] because there were some witnesses
[1:01:29] I'm not talking about godima now
[1:01:33] what's wrong with you
[1:01:36] about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:41] that's sister sister she had a problem
[1:01:44] with her legs
[1:01:46] then I took her hand
[1:01:49] and run it I think from there
[1:02:00] and they said how is it sister
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:12] the brothers
[1:02:16] but I'm sure they were not clapping
[1:02:19] hands for me
[1:02:22] because I could don't do that nothing
[1:02:29] it's you who must believe
[1:02:32] because the Bible says all things are
[1:02:36] possible
[1:02:42] to them that believe
[1:02:46] you don't need
[1:02:48] you don't need water
[1:02:55] you need Jesus
[1:02:59] you know today hey look on
[1:03:07] Divine Healing is on sale
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:16] you come what's up
[1:03:19] two women I was with babies
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:33] they said they went to see a prophet
[1:03:40] he judged them
[1:03:42] what it is
[1:03:45] I don't know maybe but yes kosana can
[1:03:48] remember
[1:03:49] how much was it yes
[1:03:52] because they had paid
[1:03:55] deposits a
[1:04:01] paid that profit
[1:04:04] they are all called Prophets
[1:04:09] but only the Bible said yeah
[1:04:18] and this full
[1:04:20] prophets
[1:04:22] they perform miracles
[1:04:27] now we as Christians we don't wander at
[1:04:29] that
[1:04:33] they shall come
[1:04:35] and shall perform marriage
[1:04:39] and wonders
[1:04:45] now
[1:04:46] we know that's it okay amen
[1:04:51] let's do this now amen now why I read
[1:04:54] description
[1:04:57] we have a book here
[1:05:00] I'm going to
[1:05:02] refer to uh the very same things
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:11] in just like as we were in um
[1:05:19] firstly it's not really
[1:05:22] a
[1:05:23] the word says
[1:05:25] the seventh seal
[1:05:28] which is Revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:05:34] the people are struggling with that
[1:05:38] let's see
[1:05:40] and saying
[1:05:41] if a person says he can preach the seven
[1:05:45] seal he is a liar uh
[1:05:54] I believe that
[1:05:57] if a person believes
[1:06:01] the Seven Seals
[1:06:04] is something that should not be
[1:06:08] okay
[1:06:16] because that is the word of God
[1:06:22] but
[1:06:24] I told you one day
[1:06:27] we were looking for
[1:06:30] the kennel before a Brother's
[1:06:33] uh pickup
[1:06:38] brother from
[1:06:40] Swaziland
[1:06:43] now we arrive at the place
[1:06:50] then we arrived at that
[1:06:54] barriers
[1:07:04] what did he say no entry
[1:07:06] Beyond this point
[1:07:11] amen amen so we stopped
[1:07:15] said no end meaning you've been
[1:07:17] troubleshooting
[1:07:36] a young man
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:40] he just went in straight through the
[1:07:43] gate yeah
[1:07:46] now there was a garden
[1:07:49] we ask you
[1:07:51] why we are forbidden
[1:08:00] he's the son of the owner
[1:08:08] of God will go through
[1:08:13] amen amen
[1:08:17] every song
[1:08:20] God knew this
[1:08:23] when he made himself a son
[1:08:28] amen amen
[1:08:31] and
[1:08:33] it says
[1:08:35] if you read perfect faith
[1:08:40] he died
[1:08:43] for you and me
[1:08:48] I will wonder if you can tell me that
[1:08:51] you don't believe him yeah
[1:08:55] I wonder if you want to be baptizing his
[1:08:59] name is
[1:09:04] because in the Bible
[1:09:09] said
[1:09:10] baptize them in the name of the Father
[1:09:12] the Son and the Holy ghosts
[1:09:22] caught up with that
[1:09:24] and their disciples but the rest of the
[1:09:28] people
[1:09:29] amen amen
[1:09:31] they went ahead and say we baptize you
[1:09:35] in the name of the father
[1:09:40] now you ask
[1:09:42] what is that name
[1:09:47] if I say to you baptize this man
[1:09:55] of the father
[1:09:59] I'm referring to one day
[1:10:06] now I'm referring to his offices
[1:10:12] you go back you read Isaiah he's a
[1:10:15] father
[1:10:19] he came and was born like us
[1:10:25] he took a body of men
[1:10:28] then he said Son
[1:10:35] then
[1:10:36] he resurrected
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] but fellow how many people
[1:10:49] one person
[1:10:51] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:59] if you say father
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:13] father is a title not a name
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:19] try it one day
[1:11:22] sign your check and say father you want
[1:11:24] to check out all
[1:11:27] the bank
[1:11:34] they want what
[1:11:37] the name
[1:11:39] in the name of Jesus
[1:11:47] if you say to a demon I cast you in the
[1:11:50] name of father
[1:11:52] foreign
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:29] uh
[1:12:31] she complained after
[1:12:33] foreign
[1:12:40] because the
[1:12:43] the Baptist today
[1:12:47] I I baptize you and
[1:12:53] uh three three times also three times
[1:13:00] I think the first time
[1:13:02] he is not wet enough according to the uh
[1:13:10] foreign
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:57] said hey
[1:14:00] you left out the Sun
[1:14:06] he said in I baptize you in the name of
[1:14:08] the father and the holy ghosts
[1:14:15] foreign
[1:14:43] if you
[1:14:45] catch him into three pieces
[1:14:51] win
[1:14:59] but if he is one fella then you will see
[1:15:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] we have seen so many people
[1:15:13] back to their pastors
[1:15:17] and said ask your pastor
[1:15:21] to show you in the Bible
[1:15:24] where anybody was baptized
[1:15:52] and he said all things
[1:15:56] do all things
[1:16:11] receive the word of God
[1:16:15] I've finished with this
[1:16:19] the thing is
[1:16:22] the back side of the book
[1:16:27] as efficiency
[1:16:30] has predestinated us
[1:16:36] not in 1944 1944 but before
[1:16:42] the foundation of the world itself
[1:16:52] finish
[1:16:58] that's why God created the Earth
[1:17:09] because the Earth
[1:17:12] is the missile okay
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:18] foreign
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:47] because power
[1:17:49] he found them in some different systems
[1:17:57] even finally
[1:17:59] said to them I see no fault with this
[1:18:11] as for me
[1:18:15] posh
[1:18:21] I mean
[1:18:24] Orange
[1:18:26] listen now now the back side
[1:18:38] on the back side
[1:18:42] with Seven Seals
[1:18:46] and
[1:18:48] when he opened the seventh seal
[1:18:53] then it said early and the time is
[1:18:57] normal
[1:19:02] right now I read here
[1:19:07] now that's why the people do not
[1:19:10] understand things like the battle of
[1:19:13] armageddonough
[1:19:17] what it is
[1:19:21] what makes them
[1:19:23] not to understand
[1:19:29] even the seven seal itself
[1:19:33] people are still still crying out but
[1:19:37] you must say if somebody says this
[1:19:39] revealed is a lion
[1:19:44] is God's Prophet a lion
[1:19:49] we will read again that it is
[1:20:05] that's why you see people today
[1:20:07] resigning
[1:20:11] the Bible foretold that is
[1:20:16] the reason
[1:20:18] the reason I don't believe the message
[1:20:27] they don't even know what the word cult
[1:20:29] says
[1:20:37] a person who was not there
[1:20:41] cannot know their things
[1:20:51] that's why it says
[1:20:54] all the way who who this is Page 534.
[1:21:00] amen amen
[1:21:02] that's why you understand brother amen
[1:21:06] there are some
[1:21:08] sermons
[1:21:11] that a man will hear once yes and
[1:21:17] he will never again
[1:21:20] be interested in it
[1:21:24] it means he hasn't seen it
[1:21:30] ah
[1:21:31] no listen here
[1:21:34] the book was sealed one day back
[1:21:41] now you have the backside Mysteries
[1:21:49] all the way back from Genesis
[1:21:59] from there
[1:22:02] beginning in Genesis
[1:22:05] because in the beginning
[1:22:12] all right amen
[1:22:15] then another scripture here it says
[1:22:22] um
[1:22:23] about the seven
[1:22:27] meaning that for you to understand this
[1:22:31] or to hear this
[1:22:33] yourself
[1:22:37] God knows all things because he is the
[1:22:40] creator of all things
[1:22:43] foreign
[1:23:50] or else it will confuse you
[1:23:54] now the Lord Jesus came
[1:23:56] as the word that was manifested
[1:24:06] for this word to be made flesh
[1:24:12] she said I know that yeah this word
[1:24:17] eventually one day
[1:24:19] will be a speaking movement
[1:24:24] but for this word to speak
[1:24:27] it should be a man
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] then he waited for the way
[1:24:44] when she approached the Lord Jesus
[1:24:47] Christ
[1:24:52] that's when the two texts
[1:24:56] came together
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:02] okay
[1:25:04] I'll never quit this message
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:10] because I've seen it
[1:25:15] now John
[1:25:17] you don't come to to God by reading
[1:25:21] but you come by revelation
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:27] all right
[1:25:30] look
[1:25:32] the Lord Jesus comes
[1:25:34] he finds three men fishing
[1:25:37] a stranger to them as a h
[1:25:41] he said or follow me
[1:25:45] Peter John and James
[1:25:49] they just drop everything
[1:25:53] what has happened to them
[1:25:58] a fisherman fishing
[1:26:05] confusion yeah
[1:26:09] you mean I should leave my fishes
[1:26:18] what happened to them
[1:26:25] that's why worry
[1:26:27] he touched me
[1:26:30] oh he touched me
[1:26:33] and they say let let him touch you
[1:26:41] so he touched Peter Jones
[1:26:47] not with his fingers
[1:26:50] but from back there we fell out
[1:26:53] foreign
[1:27:21] Balaji
[1:27:29] till today they are with you
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:36] amen one seed
[1:27:39] he has predestinated
[1:27:51] when I remember what the Lord has done
[1:27:56] I will never
[1:27:58] go back
[1:28:00] anymore right
[1:28:04] when you remember
[1:28:10] the sin that was heard
[1:28:13] he's getting you closer to him
[1:28:18] when you remember what he has done
[1:28:24] when you are tested
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:31] I shall never
[1:28:34] go back
[1:28:42] you can always go back
[1:28:46] and say the reason
[1:28:49] foreign
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:19] that it is
[1:29:32] and
[1:29:35] the woman
[1:29:39] was the devil made had to think
[1:29:44] for yourself
[1:29:49] until she said okay okay
[1:29:55] okay
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:01] and you see it cost humankind
[1:30:08] diseases yes
[1:30:15] just because of that
[1:30:21] amen
[1:30:24] now that people want you not to believe
[1:30:27] but to think
[1:30:33] and Jesus never said Think Jesus
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:41] have faith in God
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:49] lastly
[1:30:52] all the way
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:02] from the very beginning
[1:31:07] I don't know if I can read another one
[1:31:11] right

[1:39:18] the battle of Armageddon
[1:39:20] who's against who
[1:39:24] okay
[1:39:25] I don't know how many will say we should
[1:39:28] come and and do something to show who's
[1:39:32] against you
[1:39:39] it's not a country against the country
[1:39:42] no it started in heaven
[1:39:47] it is in the Bible
[1:39:48] and it's coming to the end
[1:39:52] called the battle
