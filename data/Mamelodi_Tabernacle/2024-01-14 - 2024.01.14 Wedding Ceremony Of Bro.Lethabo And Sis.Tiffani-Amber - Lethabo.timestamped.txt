[27:52] afternoon in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:56] Christ amen and
[27:59] so you
[28:01] know
[28:03] uh not puzzled but I am
[28:08] [Music]
[28:10] blessed I didn't expect such a
[28:15] big what's let me not say is it
[28:21] Crow or I would say
[28:26] crown
[28:28] yeah so God bless you for your
[28:34] support I was trying to stop one
[28:37] unmarried
[28:41] brother
[28:42] because I knew that he was just leaving
[28:46] for uh to a place where they FR meet him
[28:56] so
[28:58] then I tried to say brother brother
[29:00] there's a wedding
[29:02] here yeah I just
[29:07] said
[29:09] amen I'm waiting for him the day he
[29:12] tells me that he's getting
[29:18] married God bless you
[29:20] Saints may the Lord bless
[29:23] you I really have never expected such a
[29:27] big
[29:31] crowd since it is
[29:35] afternoon I thought it would be
[29:37] something hectic for you to come and
[29:41] remain
[29:42] here this is what God is going to do for
[29:46] you and your
[29:49] children
[29:51] amen okay so it's a a
[29:56] wedding
[29:57] um you know there was one I think in

[30:03] [Music]
[30:05] somewhere call it they called it
[30:10] Royal and uh it was
[30:13] published
[30:16] World okay not saying anything against
[30:23] that but I believe
[30:25] when uh it's a marriage of children of
[30:31] [Music]
[30:32] God amen amen it's more than anything
[30:36] you think
[30:40] of we have young people unmarried
[30:46] here some of them after the service they
[30:49] were at the
[30:52] parking where are
[30:56] they are
[30:59] married and I agree with the
[31:04] prophet when he says men should marry
[31:11] young
[31:18] [Music]
[31:19] because you
[31:23] know now if the time for a young man has
[31:26] passed
[31:29] now he being a boss in the family you
[31:35] understand he become bossy
[31:39] and chasing around his sisters and so
[31:43] for until one of the
[31:49] [Music]
[31:51] sister
[31:53] okay

[32:00] Time young man what are you waiting
[32:06] for can you
[32:08] answer what are you waiting

[32:44] necessarily yes sir but we want to make
[32:47] this
[32:49] something
[32:51] uh to remain in your
[32:56] heart

[34:24] sisters as I promised
[34:29] and but you know I can't
[34:33] preach long for a long
[34:38] time you know no man can preach for a
[34:41] long
[34:48] time you can just preach the word of
[34:53] God for the time that God has
[34:59] given now here I'm not here to
[35:02] preach we are going
[35:04] to celebrate
[35:08] together
[35:10] um marriage is a wonderful
[35:15] thing
[35:18] [Music]
[35:19] if it is blessed by
[35:23] God marriage is a wonderful thing
[35:28] in the
[35:31] Lord you
[35:33] know without
[35:35] [Music]
[35:38] God somebody getting

[41:44] amen yesterday night I
[41:48] was just studing the word of
[41:53] God and there was something in my heart
[41:57] amen that came like a
[42:01] flood and it took away all the
[42:06] things I was thinking of
[42:09] amen and I remain thinking only about
[42:13] Jesus
[42:20] am and
[42:24] I there was something deep in my
[42:30] soul
[42:33] saying this
[42:39] Jesus I believe one
[42:44] day that day is
[42:53] coming I don't know but but in my heart
[42:58] there's
[43:00] something deeply
[43:02] rooted in my
[43:04] heart about
[43:10] Jesus whom I will see
[43:15] with my own
[43:21] eyes that's why the Lord is changing
[43:27] ohy as even our seeing is
[43:32] changing because very very
[43:36] soon we're going to meet the
[43:43] king it keeps me awake all the
[43:47] [Music]
[43:51] time I have gone past the things of this
[43:55] world

[57:48] here now Matthews I'll finish with
[57:53] Matthew
[57:57] uh 19 Matthew 19 where my
[58:04] time 19
[58:07] yes verse three the Pharisees also came
[58:10] unto him tempting you know what it means
[58:15] tempting saying unto him is it lawful
[58:18] for a
[58:19] man to put away his wife for every
[58:23] cause
[58:26] amen
[58:27] amen we know that is
[58:32] tempting and he
[58:35] answered because they
[58:39] asked
[58:42] God amen amen they thought he's a
[58:47] lawyer or so for they missed
[58:52] it they were not supposed to ask him
[58:55] such a
[58:57] question and he answered and
[59:00] said have you
[59:03] read that which he which made
[59:09] them
[59:12] when at the
[59:16] beginning there is no second hand
[59:23] here he who made at the
[59:25] beginning made them male and
[59:30] female and
[59:32] said for this
[59:35] cause shall a man leave father and
[59:42] mother maybe today you'll understand
[59:49] this
[59:51] men came without father and mother
[59:58] who is the mother of
[1:00:02] Adam no
[1:00:05] mother you know I thought I'm talking to
[1:00:07] you like I'm talking to an
[1:00:13] officer let me ask a question who was
[1:00:16] the mother of AD and the father
[1:00:23] of
[1:00:26] yeah the powerful one is coming from
[1:00:30] here God bless

[1:00:52] amen right amen
[1:00:55] we were not supposed to
[1:00:58] be
[1:01:01] born we just supposed to be
[1:01:05] created because the Bible says he

[1:02:33] wife is a creation that God has
[1:02:38] prepared that's a
[1:02:42] called that's why they said where is
