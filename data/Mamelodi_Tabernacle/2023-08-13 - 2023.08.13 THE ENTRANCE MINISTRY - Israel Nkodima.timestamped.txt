[17:51] mind
[17:52] are now regathering
[17:56] for a takeoff
[17:58] that's why we know that we are on the
[18:02] wrong way
[18:04] not turning back
[18:07] we have seen the city already
[18:09] the city to come
[18:13] and the prophet also said the pride is
[18:17] like that City
[18:19] so thank you Lord we
[18:22] are waiting for that day
[18:24] when we shall meet in the air amen and

[19:47] God bless you God bless you
[19:54] no one day we were in Swaziland
[19:58] [Music]
[20:00] and
[20:03] uh so
[20:06] something happened that I couldn't
[20:09] apologize for
[20:16] no you know when we read that scripture
[20:20] Revelation chapter 9.
[20:23] 21 or 21 you still remember description
[20:27] read it out to us
[20:31] Revelation 21 from verse 1 to 3.
[20:35] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[20:38] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[20:40] were passed away and there was no more
[20:42] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[20:46] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[20:48] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a
[20:52] husband
[20:52] and I had a great voice out of Heaven
[20:55] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[20:58] with me and he will dwell with them and
[21:01] they shall be his people and God himself
[21:04] shall be with them and be their God
[21:07] amen amen
[21:11] um
[21:14] every time I read that scripture
[21:19] because he says behold
[21:25] is with me
[21:28] now it's not talking about the
[21:31] Tabernacle the building
[21:33] it's talking about his body
[21:39] shall be with us
[21:43] [Music]
[21:48] and
[21:49] as I say
[21:51] it shall be no no more
[21:55] like today
[21:58] our father
[22:00] no heaven will come down
[22:05] so it won't be our father
[22:09] it will be our father who will be here
[22:13] with us
[22:14] working with us talking with us
[22:18] mouth to mouth
[22:22] so it won't be our father in Heaven
[22:25] it will be our father who is really with
[22:29] us
[22:33] that made me tears
[22:38] ity
[22:47] amen amen
[22:50] this is what we are waiting for
[22:53] I don't know what you are waiting for
[22:55] you
[23:02] know when Jesus came
[23:08] the first thing he did
[23:11] he went around collecting the people we
[23:15] let us
[23:23] Eternal brethren
[23:25] [Music]
[23:27] those who were in him
[23:29] James
[23:50] he said follow me
[23:52] [Music]
[23:55] he didn't struggle to say repentance
[24:03] follow me
[24:06] I live
[24:07] that was enough for Peter
[24:10] John and James
[24:12] they never ask any questions
[24:15] follow you who are you
[24:18] no because that voice
[24:20] came from before the foundation of the
[24:24] world
[24:27] he spoke with them on the foundation of
[24:30] the world
[24:31] you know the summer written women
[24:35] foreign
[24:40] she went around
[24:43] saying repeating one thing I know
[24:47] Messiah
[24:51] now firstly you should understand
[24:54] he says I know
[24:58] whether this gospel preachings about him
[25:05] in particular I I know
[25:10] I know the Rapture is coming
[25:16] amen amen
[25:18] I know yes
[25:27] while she was on the street
[25:31] as a prostitute
[25:34] you see how
[25:35] we just need to bring destination works
[25:42] yet in that woman
[25:45] there was light
[25:49] a little like this
[25:53] and while he was on the street
[25:58] and in her
[26:01] transparent uh
[26:06] budget inside
[26:09] there was that little light
[26:16] now I know the Messiah
[26:21] and when he is
[26:25] he will tell us
[26:32] we all look for a message
[26:36] that could tell us all things
[26:42] we looked for a prophet
[26:47] who could
[26:49] tell us all things
[26:54] amen amen you know the bride of Christ
[26:59] from Miracles and wonders
[27:04] great I see that is in here
[27:10] now

[27:18] I'm looking at the
[27:20] scripture

[28:18] shall be ministered
[28:25] unto you

[30:08] John 14 14 you are familiar with
[30:12] description

[30:30] and
[30:31] that day that is this day
[30:39] because it has happened
[30:43] foreign
[31:09] there's no dispute with that because

[47:11] that is the price if you see somebody
[47:14] coming to our church
[47:17] he is a church member
[47:20] who comes no he's not even a member
[47:24] no he's a church
[47:27] [Music]
[47:39] after he has taken a bottle
[47:42] he comes to church
[47:52] no we were surprised
[47:55] when we saw him
[48:00] oh
[48:02] democracy
[48:10] Christian is somebody who is Christ's
[48:13] life
[48:16] Christianity is not a religion amen
[48:20] [Music]
[48:22] religion
[48:25] religion is something about God
[48:27] Christianity
[48:33] [Music]
[48:38] that is a Christian because
[48:41] Christ dwells in that person
[48:48] so don't call anything Christians
[48:53] until you see Christ amen
[48:59] amen then you can say I perceived
[49:05] amen amen amen and
[49:10] uh let me finish now now

[49:48] amen amen
[49:51] you know even last week we were looking
[49:53] at this
[49:55] the world
[50:02] two different things
[50:06] the Bible says
[50:07] God made the world
[50:10] and the Earth
[50:13] [Music]
[50:16] the f is this music
[50:21] but the world is a system
[50:26] that's why the Bible says love not the
[50:29] things of the world
[50:34] he that loves the things of the world
[50:37] he has not seen God have not seen God
[50:43] amen amen
[50:45] now you have the Warriors
[50:51] is that right amen now and the Bible
[50:55] says
[50:58] you know that scripture brother
[51:00] the world
[51:02] hates me says the Lord
[51:09] he didn't say the Earth
[51:14] is that John 17 where it says
[51:20] the world
[51:23] hates you
[51:28] is it there
[51:32] finding that scripture for him Miss John
[51:35] someway John 17 then
[51:40] 17.
[51:43] for you are not of the world 2017 from
[51:47] this
[51:48] voting
[51:50] I have given them my weight and the
[51:53] world have hated them because they are
[51:57] not of the world even as I am not of the
[52:00] world
[52:01] the world

[52:08] even
[52:10] amen amen
[52:14] even as I am not
[52:19] and the world have hated them because
[52:21] they are not of the world even as I am
[52:24] not of the world
[52:27] you love God because he's not of the
[52:30] world
[52:32] and you will only love him when you are
[52:36] also not of the world
[52:39] [Applause]
[52:41] but if you are of the world
[52:43] you hate God
[52:47] foreign
[52:57] because religion is not Christian
[53:05] oh
[53:06] now it says
[53:13] he came into a body
[53:15] you know the Bible says the way it was
[53:17] made
[53:18] [Music]
[53:21] and I was reading where it says
[53:25] although she was a prostitute
[53:28] working around them but yet there was
[53:31] something in here
[53:35] I know Messiah
[53:39] have you seen such a thing
[53:42] somebody going like this
[53:45] on the streets
[53:47] and every moment she will enter I know
[53:51] the Messiah
[53:56] and when
[53:58] he is
[54:02] he will tell us
[54:08] foreign
[54:31] [Music]
[54:45] why they call that belt
[54:50] if yeah a Tracker belt if they
[54:55] maybe they want to study a lion
[55:03] they use that tracker
[55:08] and every time they come
[55:12] to the area
[55:14] and then
[55:16] they put on their receiver what do you
[55:21] call it
[55:23] going around in that area
[55:28] then if they come in the vicinity
[55:32] where the animal maybe would be more a
[55:37] populated what they will start to hear
[55:43] it then they know it is
[55:50] Jesus knew
[55:52] [Music]
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:54] when he arrived there at the sea Africa
[55:57] then he received some lips
[56:00] he knew that Peter John and James
[56:05] they are somewhere here
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:12] [Music]
[56:19] that's why
[56:20] she sent out their disciples
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] into town
[56:30] and then he remains City
[56:33] [Music]
[56:35] knowing that
[56:38] a woman a Samaritan woman is coming this
[56:43] way
[56:45] amen amen so he separated them he sent
[56:50] out the truth
[56:54] opening the way for the summer written
[56:57] movements
[57:03] and when the Jews went out
[57:08] now if you follow later
[57:11] when the summer written went out the
[57:14] Jews came in amen
[57:18] they saw that woman
[57:20] and ask him a question
[57:24] amen
[57:31] when he came in she came in
[57:36] then he started a conversation
[57:41] she is that Samaritan woman
[57:46] amen amen because you could receive some
[57:49] lips
[57:52] there's somebody predestinated around
[57:54] here
[57:56] foreign
[58:36] [Applause]
[58:39] amen so
[58:42] he came for that amen
[58:50] you know the story is foreign
[59:09] what was left for here
[59:12] [Music]

[1:00:31] she even went to borrow some a schedule
[1:00:38] amen amen
[1:00:39] and
[1:00:42] something you know
[1:00:45] that was not because she had the things
[1:00:59] you look at the mercy of God
