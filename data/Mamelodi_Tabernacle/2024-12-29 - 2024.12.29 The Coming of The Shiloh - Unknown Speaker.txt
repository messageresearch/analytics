Ghost, Holy Ghost, we [Music] [Applause] Amen. Amen. God bless you, Richie. May be seated for a moment. I want to first thank God for letting me come here and uh preach for you because it's a privilege for me to be standing at this pulpit and I thank Pastor our elder as I call him my father because pastor I always say pastor is my daddy is my father not only physically But especially in the seven seas, you know you here you cannot realize how privileged you are. I know I know many of you you don't realize it. But if you go around the world, if you have the opportunity to listen to ministers in the world, how they preach this message, then you realize the value of having pastor as [Applause] [Music] I have been personally in many places and I heard many pastors but let me say something. Pastor Kodima is the only pastor not in South Africa, not even in Africa, but I mean in the world. [Applause] Now I'm I'm telling you those things from my heart. These things I say come from my heart and God knows my heart and uh I think I will speak about those things in a few minutes so that we can realize that even in South Africa if Someone has been predestinated to go into that rapture. Are you ready? He must be here. [Applause] Hallelujah. So, it's a honor for me to be standing at this pulpit. [Applause] Okay, let's go to the word now. As we can stand, we read the word. [Music] You know those scriptures, we are familiar to those scriptures. We start by Revelation chapter 10 from verse one to verse 7. Verse 1 to 7. The Bible say, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire." And he had in his hand a little book open, And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth. And cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted his hands to heaven and swear by him that liveth and heaven who created heaven and the things that therein and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophets. Okay, let's to another scripture in Genesis 40 49 [Music] beginning by the verse 8 up to 10 8 to 10 Genesis 40 [Music] 49 Genesis 49 verse 8 this I wait until you get there. So, because that's my main inspiration. Are you there? Okay, let's read now. Judah. Judah. Thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise. Thy hand shall be in the neck of thy enemies. Thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion. Well, from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stoop down. He couches his lion. He he okay he yes and as an old lion who shall rose him up the s shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his [Music] feet until Shiloh came and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. Amen. Amen. Let's take the last one. Colossians chapter one. The last one. Colossians chapter 1 vers 27- 28 27- 28 to whom God would make known what? What is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. The hope of glory whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. May God bless his word. May be seated. And this morning I took my subject and it's entitled the coming of the Shiloh. Shiloh. the coming of the child. You know, it was when Jacob was blessing his sons like every father can do with his sons to bless them. And Jacob was blessing his sons. which one was coming. He started by Reuben. Then came Judah. Judah. When Jacob came to Judah, he blessed Judah. He said, Judah, you will be praised by all your brothers. [Music] You will be a king. You will have the sector of king. It will never leave you. You reign because you remember from Judah came Jesus. So Jacob as a prophet was prophesying that from his son Judah will come a king. And that king will have the s of king and it will never leave Judah. But he had it until the Shiloh came. I know many many are read the Bible readers but many have not yet checked that [Music] word. I did. I did. And even the theologians they could not understand exactly what does it mean. They gave many meanings to that word. Some say it's messiah. Shiloh means messiah. Some of them say Shiloh means a messenger of peace. [Music] But I took the correct interpretation. They say shallow means he to him to whom it belongs. He to whom it belongs. Judah Judah will reign. until he to whom it belongs shall come. There is someone who those things belongs to the authority, the dominion, and the reign upon the earth. [Applause] That's a man. Man is he to whom that authority that power that authority belongs. [Applause] Let's get into that. Are you ready? Now [Music] this message, this message is a mysterious message. There is a message in the message. This message is not for the multitude of people. [Music] This message is from eternity. This message is not of the time. But the message is a message beyond the time. A message of redemption. Which means this is something to bring you back to what you were. That's why many people don't get exactly what the message is. The prophet says in the first seal paragraph 68, the prophet says when God sent messengers during 2,000 years, it was just the time the messengers came through the ages each messengers brought his own message. You know in a time in a age everything in the Bible cannot give you life. Life can only comes by the message of your [Applause] hour. And when the hour change You must follow the pillar of fire because life can only follow the message of the hour. So when you are living in an age, the first thing you must do is to recognize what is exactly the message of your age. Because in each age there is promises related to this age. Let me put it like this. All the promise in the Bible cannot give you life. Now only the promises of your age can give you salvation. can deliver you, can bless your soul, can save you. Not hold the Bible. You know those denominations, they have the same Bible. They read the Bible. They believe in Jesus. But why are not they going to the rapture? They believe in Jesus. They believe in baptism. Some of them don't drink. They live cleanly. But why they don't go to the rapture? Ask yourself that question. Because they miss something. And we when we come here, we must preach what they miss. If you come here and you continue to listen to the very same things, that means there is something wrong somewhere. The prophet says until it comes to that last angel. You all know who is the last angel. That's the prophet. our prophets. And the prophet says, "Now when that last angel came, he has no certain mystery." He has no certain mystery, but he gathers up all that's been lost in the all the ages. all the truth that was not truly revealed. As the revelation came, then he reveals those things in his day. If you want to read it, there it is. Revelation 10 one to about four. You get it. All right. Amen. see takes the book of the seals, breaks them and shows the seven angel. Now listen, the prophecies, for this alone, the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seven [Applause] angels. What is the ministry of Brham? This this alone the mysteries is the ministry of brother. Any message church who don't preach the mysteries of God don't preach the ministry of the seven angel. You should be coming here every day. Listen only to the mysteries because the mysteries alone is the ministry of the seven nations. Amen. Are we together? Let me proceed. When God sent the prophet, the message of the prophet got twopart. It's a twofold ministry, a twofold mystery. There is an evangelical part. in the message of the prophet and there is also a prophetical part. When God sent the prophet, he say you plays the role of an evangelist. But it's not your ministry. You just start by being an evangelist. Then when come the time, I will send you as a prophet because an evangelist cannot reveal the mysteries. An evangelist is not a revealer of the mysteries. to reveal the mysteries. The part the prophet must pass from the evangelical part to the prophetic one because only a prophet is a revealer of the mysteries. Amen. But what the devil is doing now, I'm sorry to tell you that the majority of the churches who call themselves the message of the hour, they are still dealing with that evangelical pass, teaching no mysteries. No seven seas, no seven thunders, no god sheep, [Applause] but to go to the rapture, you must pass from that evangelical to the prophetic one. Because to be prepared for the rapture, you must be taught the mysteries and the mysteries alone. Amen. The mysteries only. You know what happened with the prophet? When God sent him, he was a forer that the evangelical like John the Baptist. That's what the prophet says. And let me read it for you. It's in the message. The bridge between the seven seas and the seven church ages. Let's start by the the paragraph 39. I will explain something to you so that you must not uh uh miss it because if you miss that part, you won't make it for the rapture. You are just wasting your time in the church because the prophet says the mysteries are the things that will start the rapturing faith. You cannot just be sitting here and waiting for the rapture. You must be prepared. And the thing that prepare you for the rapture is the miss of God. Who God is. Who God is. The prophet says this. He said now 39. The bridge. The bridge. He said now it wrote mysterious Because no man, nowhere knows it. You know this message, no man, nowhere, no churches know this message. The prophet said God alone. Jesus Christ is the only one who knows something about you. And when you happen to know something about those nearnesses, it means that God has came upon you. It's a choice from God to reveal himself to you. Because if God don't come to you, you cannot understand those things. There is people here in the church they will understand nothing because the name were not put on the book of life. If you understand those things, that means that before the foundation of the world, God by his mercy put your name in the book of life and no one can blot it out. God alone, let's let's stud it. God alone knows it. It's a book. The prophet say it's a mysterious book. The book sealed with seven sins. It's a mysterious book. Powerful book that can bring you back to what you were, cleanse you and make you pure. This mysterious book can take you to heaven now. Amen. There is something inside that book that every predestinated must know because the things that contain in that book, prepare you for the rapture. Mysterious book, it's it's the book. The prophet say it's the book of redemption. You know what redemption means? Redemption means go back to where you were. You cannot listen to the message. If you were not there for the beginning, only those who were there in the beginning can listen to what I'm preaching today. Those people are there in this in the room. This are they there? The people who are there are you there? Amen. Redemption means you were there for the first time. You see? Amen. It's not something you can make up or wake up something that you have to force it. It's not by might not by your own will not by prayers. It's a choice of God because before the foundation of the world, God saw you there. And since God saw you there, he must brings you back to where you were. So now the mechanics to bring you back is contained in that mysterious book. It's a book of redemption. You know when we preaching it's like we are forcing people to believe. Let me tell you we are not forcing people. Only those who were there in the beginning can receive the message and go to the [Applause] rapture. Let's go. It's it's a book of redemption. Let's let's put it there. It's easier for me. It's a book of redemption. The prophecy will get into that. Listen now. And now we know the this book of redemption, will not be understood. No, we cannot. The churches cannot understand. It's probate through six church ages ages they were presuming they were trying to understand because during the the 2,000 years of churches they could not understand it because those things are beyond the time. This ministry is a ministry from beyond the time. When you are in the time in church ages, you cannot understand. The angel comes when time is over. And what you are listening today comes from eternity. Because the eternity is here. Uh I don't listen to your amen. Give me another one please. The prophet says when the seven angel came they brought eternity. Eternity came into time. And if you receive that book today, eternity will get into your soul and then you became a candidate for the [Applause] rapture. But if you are still on that path, evangelical path, you won't go nowhere. [Applause] But but you'll be a good sister, a good brother. Every every man in your neighborhood say good things about me. It's a good brother. It's a good sister. Let me tell you, I'm not good. But God lives in me. That makes me good. The prophet says the mountain was not a holy mountain. When Peter went there on the mountain, Peter says, "We were on the holy mountain." And the prophet says, "The mountain was not holy, but the holy one. When he came to the mountain, the mountain became a holy one. The problem with the people, they want to become holy by themselves. You cannot be holy. There is nothing in you can make you holy. Paul say in the Bible, that's a mystery. When Christ come in you, that's the hope of glory. Amen. A holy God living in the people makes those people holy. Brothers and [Applause] sisters, when John was baptizing, It was his age because the prophet said in the age you got seasons. You can have an age but you forget that in the age you got seasons. You must be in the air, the right end, but in the wrong season. When John was baptizing, that was the age. And he said, "Someone is coming after me." Then Jesus came. When Jesus came, John is saying, "Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world." And then two only [Applause] followed only two followed Jesus. The Bible says the next day people came back to the same place. [Applause] with John baptizing when Jesus was already there. Pay attention to that when the forana introduce the coming. You follow the one who has come. Amen. Amen. Amen. The prophet continue. That's good. The prophet says, "But at the end, when the seventh angel begins to sound his mist, the prophet calls this part as a forunner. He called this part the preparation days. He was preparing the people because the message was supposed to come after when the prophet started his ministry. That was not the message. That was a preparation of a forer. He was doing the work of an evangelist. healing vision, discerning campaigns, those words just evangelical and you know when you are in this path everyone is good for you know they like you they congratulate you you're a good man you will see the power of God But when the message came they reject [Applause] you there will be no association because now you are in the message. You are in the message now. Let them go away. When they want to go, let them [Applause] go. You stay here. Don't go nowhere. That's the message. They they are making it to become so comprehensive so that people can understand. No. Uhuh. Jesus did not do that. Jesus said, "You eat my flesh. You drink my bread." And they come to the Bible. They say, "Moses said, Moses said, don't drink the Bible." Jesus said, I say even if it's not in the Bible, it's a message. The prophet said something happened when God want to gather his group, something will happen. And God do that purposely so that those who are not predestinated will stumble and they will go away. Please deacons don't follow them. Don't follow them. If they were of God, they will understand who is [Applause] pastor. Since they don't know pastor, that means they don't know. If they don't know brother, it means they don't know Jesus. Because the mysteries is the word of God. Amen. And the word of God is Jesus [Applause] Christ. Amen. Let's go. Listen to the the prophet says at the end when the seven angel begin to sound his He winds up all of those ene fellows during the church ages like Luther. They were preaching about sanctification without knowing the true real sanctification. Even Luther was preaching justification without knowing. When the prophet came, he said justification means revelation. Justification because that's your faith. Faith means a revelation. And when you have a revelation that you are justified and to be justified means you have been forgiven a god that's forgotten. And the prophet says for God it's like you have never done it to start from the beginning. Yeah. From the beginning. And they tried to understand those things they could not but now listen and the mysteries comes down from God as the word of God. The mysteries are the word of God. If you don't preach the mystery, you don't preach the word of God. Amen. Listen to me people. If a preacher does not preach to you the message, that preacher don't preach the word of God. Because for this time, the mysteries comes down from God as the word of God. Amen. And reveals the entire revelation of God. You know now who God is. The churches know who God was. He came. He died for our sins. That was what he was. But the mystery teaches what God is in the present now in the Amen. Who God is now. That's the word of God. Amen. Amen. The prophet continues. Let me go fast. He say then the Godhead and everything is settled. Amen. The people who has been preaching the mysteries, they have the revelation of the godhead who God definitely is. The prophet say when the seven se will be opened, you will know who God is, how he [Music] lives and his nature. God will be in a man. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Because God lives in a man. That's what he is, not what he was or what he will be, what saves you, revelation of who he is, amen. That's why even the prophet when he was preaching about Mechisedc the prophet didn't say who is that because knowing that cannot help you but the prophet preached mec because mechedc is keeping running along the churches. He has been changing the f because God is in more faith. People are just taking to that one form of the pictures that they know. Even the pope know that picture man. But God is in a man [Applause] today. Amen. Amen. Let me continue. The prophet says then it will be settled. Then it will be settled. Let's take breach between the 70. We are there 40. Okay. Let me think something something else and go. You know the problem is men in the beginning The prophet says this, let me take you the uncertain sound. Uncertain sound. Paragraph 34. Maybe you don't know that. You know when Jesus when Jesus came Jesus Christ is God. Amen. Amen. But he took a temple what was called Jesus. Amen. [Music] Jesus was the temple where Jesus Christ lives. It was a temple. He himself said destroy this body. And the Bible say he was talking about the temple of his body. You see people sometimes think that Christ is a surname of Jesus. You are laughing. But many people here think that if you can s you can you can you can see the ID card of Jesus ID of Jesus. Do you see the name Jesus name Christ? Let me tell you that's not it. Christ is not the surname of Christ. The angel told Joseph and Mary before Jesus came, the angel said, "You will call that baby Jesus, not Lord Jesus Christ." That young boy when he was praying there his friend were not calling me. Hey Lord Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus Christ come and play ball with me. No, he was called Jesus. But after he died, resurrected, ascended, then at the day of Pentecost, Peter for the very first time, he say to the people, that man, not that God, that man that you killed because God cannot be killed. But Jesus died. Amen. That man that you kill God made him and Christ. Amen. Christ is a an adjective adjective to qualify someone who has been anointed. Christ means a man being anointed. When God anointed man that man becomes Christ and Christ is the mystery of God revealed. A mysterious God become known to the people. Many men walk to the people anointed with God. And when you see that man, you have seen God. Amen. That's the mystery. Glorious God. The prophecies men in the beginning. He was made a go in the beginning. When he was made, a man is a god. Oh, give me an amen. Amen. at the balcony. Give me an amen. Then touch your neighbor like this. Just like this. Say you are God. In in the beginning, you because if you say pastor say oh no you are making him go for you. [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] Oh, you are making him God. In the beginning, each man was God. Amen. And when the seals were open, that man was brought back to what he was. God. Amen. [Applause] I'm God. Amen. Pastor is God. Pastor Amen. Brother is God. This church is a wonderful [Applause] church. You see what I'm preaching here? I can't preach it anywhere else. They will chase me out. But it's written [Applause] there. The prophet said that man in the beginning when he was made a man is a god. The prophet says he's absolutely a god. [Applause] You know those who put it on the books, they put a little G there. But the prophet didn't say that [Laughter] God was God. [Music] Absolutely. A god. For he was made in the image of God. [Applause] Being a son of God, then he's an of all that God [Applause] is. Not only what God has, but what God is. His is stronger than because when you are being you possess everything. Amen. God can heal the sick. Men can heal. God can create. Men can create because a man was a to all that God is. Amen. Amen. Then he fell. Then he fell. The man was a boss here. The prophet says when God created me, he said I God will be the God of the universe. you you going to be the God of this earth. And when Adam was naming the creators, he did not pray to look for the will of God. What he said, God say amen. Amen. That was what you were. I I I came here to remind you from where you fell so that today you can repossess. Amen. [Music] Yesterday I was I was talking with Pastor He was saying me if I have a problem I just speak to God like I speak to [Applause] you that's where you must come now you must become this Pentecostal we are not Pentecostal people making a lot of noise oh Jesus you have been Power given power. If you have a problem, don't cry. Speak. You are God. Absolutely. When the sins are broken, you are put back what you were and you were gone. Today you are God. I don't cry. I speak and the devil know who I am. I am a son of God. And the devil knows me. And the devil knows you. You are a son and daughter of God. speak. [Applause] When men fail, then Jesus came. Jesus was not a son of Adam. Adam f. We are the sons of Adam. The earth was given to Adam's son. Jesus was God. He came to rescue Adam because the law of God is to find a kingsman redeemer. God became a man. So that men who become God. Amen. And you know in the churches all of the preachers every Sunday they repeat to the people God become a man Jesus Christ. God become a man. Why they forget the very reason for God become a man? They prophesy. God become a man so that the man could become a god. Amen. Today I won't preach you the God who become a man. I come today to preach you the men who become God. Amen. That's why when Jesus came I I love this story. When Jesus came, it was just a temporary help from heaven. God become a man just for to fulfill the kinsman within the world. But he could not stay here forever. No, he came to redeem you. And when the redemption work is over, that's the interesting part. Now when the redemption work of Jesus is done, Jesus must leave that spot and take the man to bring that very moment to walk. You know there is a spot, a special spot where God meet Adam that's that's a a God given place of worship and at that place God can find Adam anytime anywhere. and he sees him when Adam fell he just it was taken out of that place that's why when God came down Adam then he came himself at that spot to pay the price of your sin because Jesus was the owner blood of God. No one could do that but God himself. And when the redemption work is over, God left that peace. The Bible, the prophet says when the seas were open, the redemption working was over and the lamb of God left to the redemption book, that box of redemption. Then he took the man, brought him back to that place. This is a Shiloh. Shiloh. Amen. He to whom it belongs. This place belongs to Adam. Adam was the son of God. Adam was absolutely God. Even God said to Adam, he said, "Reign. [Music] This is your your your domain. Do what you want. Dig the soil. Do everything. I am the God of universe. You are the Shiloh. Shiloh. to whom it belongs. But the lion of Judah will be standing at that spot until the [Applause] Shiloh Jesus. Let's read this. Let's finish this. The prophet says, "And man was given a do and the do was the earth, not South Africa. The earth is in South Africa, America, Europe, Europe, Tanzania, Australia, Canada, Canada is your domain." Say amen, please. Amen. That's why when I want to go somewhere, I just go. I always tell my church. I took it from pastor. He always told me, "You don't need money to [Applause] travel. You need faith. [Music] [Applause] If I want to go anywhere, I go. The first time I went to to America, it was on 2010 2010. We were 20 pastors. I was the only one to be given the visa. [Music] All they didn't know who they were. America is a part of the earth and that's on my [Applause] do when I was going to that man that counel I don't know you call it in English that man who put the I came to him looking at him like this say where are you going I I I go to America to do what? To say I have a conference there. What city? I say Pennsylvania. [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] who you [Applause] are. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, I have a I want I don't have a job. I'm sick. Now, you know nowadays, you are just you you even call the pastor for tooth ache. That that's what makes him sick. Just imagine praying for your tooth ache, backachche. You are God. Speak. Amen. You are the Shiloh. Shiloh. It belongs to you. The earth belongs to you. The authority belongs to you. The prophet he said you have power over the fishes over the falls of the earth over everything. Say amen. Amen. Amen means beat unto me. Power over everything. The prophecy he could just speak and everything obeyed him. Why? Because he was God within himself. [Applause] You are God within yourself. [Applause] Everything that happened to you out here is controlled by what is being inside of you. [Applause] If you are not you're not well or okay with what is around you, speak from within yourself to change the condition and the environment because you are God inside of you. Amen. That's the difference between put it the difference between says and everything else God within himself not universal. Amen. When you say when we say that we are God that's not means the heaven and earth that's not we are saying God is still God in the universe the same God from the universe made out of you a god of the earth god of universe lives inside of you. Christ in you, the hope of [Applause] glory. That's the biggest of all the mysteries. He says because he was God within himself, not invers God, but I mean the God of heavens and the earth. But he the man was a ruler in his man. Amen. You see, you cannot rule the universe, but as long as you are here, God wants you to be the ruler. Jesus was the ruler until the Shiloh came. That's why when Jesus finished his work, he said to his disciples, "I came from God and I now return to God. It's in the Bible. I I I won't I won't be here ruling with you, but all the power that was given to me, I give to you. Oh, say amen. People who that believes in me the works that I was doing, he will you will do also it's written in your Bible because you are the sh to whom it belongs. The Bible says but he was a ruler in his domain. He was a king. Hallelujah. A king ruler. That was you. And redemption means you are back to that again. Amen. I always told I always tell my my my church I don't believe on those long night praying prayers to have to have a wake. No, if I need a word, I speak the way. I'm a ruler. [Applause] This manager manager who is there the boss there he's working on my domain he's working on my do I have the right to speak to him inside of him no talking I command from inside of me I command and in the morning I come to him and then I will be given that job because the inside of him knows who is inside of me. For him that is in me is greater. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet continues. Hallelujah. Amen. He say and even now in his fallen state man has that appearance. Even when you are fallen, you still have that appear of a king. That's why. Amen. I don't believe on people coming to church in shades. What appearance are you giving? You are a ruler. Put your suit on. Put your tie. You are a ruler and change even the way you you walk. Hallelujah. Amen. You know the appearance you have a lot to do to your achievement. Say amen. Church I give you my example myself. I don't have money but people always think that I have money. In consequence, no one give me money. They all come asking for money. Please don't do that [Laughter] here. It's just inside of me. I came to realize I am a ruler. I am a king. I cannot lack anything. Everything comes from your inner. Amen. Amen. Hey, let me close here. Let me close here. Amen. You know where the seas were open? Let's go back to what we were reading and we stop just there. The bridge between the seven churches the bridge that is and the seven the prophet says now you see I'm just not making that up. That's what it does, say the Lord. Amen. I read to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angel message mystery that God should be declared by his because the word you must be a [Music] prophet and in this time came to us in the form of a prophet which means the son of a son of man. You see that's the prophet who has wrote the wording of the seven churches [Music] churches you know inside that book of seals. The mystery that was inside was the mystery of who Christ is. Christ is the child because when the sins were open, Christ appeared and Christ is the man. all belong. So when you don't just You must be my do anything [Music] with the coming of the road. in your English. In English, you call those who are in that domain land load. land. You are land of a son of God is a language. Amen. He said, "And when the separ and the mystery is revealed, comes the angel." Hallelujah. Amen. The messenger. Hallelujah. The saints were holding Christ my but in Because [Music] that the mystery is revealed. We would like to see Jesus and the prophet says everyone of son of God who the name are written in the book when the book is open they become him. You are the coming of Jesus coming and the prophet said God has never left here. He said because if God leaves the earth weekends. But he's descended. Even Jesus when he was walking he said no one has descended but the unrecending the inal prophet says to descend means to change your f To be sent means changing the from the spiritual to the fleshing. When the spirit live into a human being, it's a lower condition. That means descender when it get to and the Bible say I saw Jesus coming down. That's how many people look at you. He lies to me yesterday. He lies to me. He's told me money. But he's still God. He's still God. He lied to you yesterday. God because God is the one living inside and from inside that God will tell him to go and confess right from the inside. You never need someone outside to let you know that you must obey the word of God because the word of God is inside of you. [Applause] Amen. Amen. The prophet continues and we close here and When the seas are open and the revealed, thou come the angel, the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the sea. You see, when the clouds came, the angel, seven angels, they get into the prophet. Yes. Get into the prophets. That's the most powerful gets into a man flesh and blood and that makes him be an angel. But that God of living in him. You see that? Now remember he said that angel is on earth at the time of his coming this coming.
