past here I GRE you all of you God be with you amen um I'm standing here in front of you representing you all and also representing my sister here I am and also pres my pastor who sent me to stand in in his place while standing on our feet because I was told that I'm going to take at 8:00 at 9:00 we must go but now is 9:00 time to but now I'm taking don't worry let's open the book of Corinthians chapter 2 Corinthians chapter let's read 1 to 3 verse one three I believe uh I'm not going to waste your time don't worry but I I owe my sister to say something about about his belief amen amen read my brother Corinthians 5 from verse 1 to 3 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grow earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked yes can you read also Revelation 21 verse um 1 to 4 I think so then you're going to read verse 24 to um verse 27 24 like 27 Revelation 21 1 to4 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more see and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adon for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying praise God neither shall there be any more pain amen for the former things are pass away Hallelujah 24 24 the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth who bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night amen let's close our eyes dear heavenly father thank you for this privilege here are your people who are standing in front of me that expecting something from our voices our mouth to come to them and to confy them amen give us something Lord we pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen we may take your seats brothers and sisters I'm going to just speak a little about bodies I and my sister we are going to put on when we pass from this amen so that you may know the Bible here says um when this early Tabernacle is dissolved let me say like this when this Tabernacle is dissolved I am my sister we have another tabern if you are living in a house when that house is dissolved is destroyed you have to go to another one but but you will go to another one if you have got another one but if you don't have another one then you are miserable we hear people we hear earthquakes and storms destroying houses and people cry out there saying our houses are destroyed in other words they don't have no way no other place to go to but according to the B Paul says when this tacle of ours we have got another one R waiting you cannot have a a house if you have not built it or if you have not bought it and if you have not applied for it there must be some system that must be followed before you can have another house because before you can have this one there were some certain systems that brought you to this one and there must be another system so that it can BR you to another house but if you have not undergone that system don't don't don't try to tell us that you have got another one but if those who have got another one when they say we have got another house they know they have undergone some syst they know they have applied for that house they know they of house they don't just say I got house they don't are you together with that is the truth the Bible says so here then [Music] anly is a [Applause] body is this one and if if anly Tabernacle is this one in other words I have another body like this one when this one is dissolved that is how Paul is telling me that is how I telling you I know about [Applause] that to have this one all of you you know that we are all born we are born to have this body no one has this body without undergoing birth we are born all of us then we have this so to have another body you must be born you cannot have a body without B that's why Jesus told neod you must be born again so that you can have another tabernac you must be born again we have the Bible says here Peter says You must be born by a new seat which is not corruptable which is the word of God to be born again to have another Tabernacle you must be born again to be born again according to the Bible you must be born by the way you must be born by the seed and the seed which is the word of God and the word we have said the way travel through the body the word from God to the vision Mary through the Angel God sent the angel and gave the angel the seed and the angel went to Mar with the seed and the angel brought the seed to Mary the word spoken by the angel to Mary come the blood in the womb ofy the word was brought by the angel to Philip was brought to Philip Philip carried the seed to the UN so that they can be Bel to have Bel there must be a seat amen [Music] amen you obtain this [Applause] through the seat let me say I don't want to go deeper in this one there must be an angel which must bring the SE to the woman in the end time there is a a vision which received the SE who has made the angel who is that this one she met the angel I may witness for that she met the [Applause] angel let let me say this going to go far so that you cannot be angry with [Music] me because you are impatient I know people want to hear stories when it comes to the way of [Applause] always I'm not going to waste your time we have got types of bodies because this is a body as the Bible says PA says so he says we have got different type of he said you have got anly body and we have got Heavenly Body that is what Paul said we have got this one this is called a terrestrial body and this body belongs here and it ends here then we have got another one the second one which is called the the theop a Celestial one this theop belongs to another dimension it does not belong to this one it is belongs to another dimension but if you are born again when you die from here you go to that one because it's another amen but it's for those who are born again when the new bed start to grow in you in [Applause] you there is another body been formed somewhere that is how the man of God says the Bible says and that body is a when you die here being the child of God if you have applied for this house if you have got that that that house is called theop then you go to that house are you together with me I believe that my sister now he is in that house amen he's together with others some are from the Old Testament they are there in that Buddhist when Jesus rise up according to the scripture those old Saints there rose up with they move he went to Paradise because he went first to hell to to take the keys to from Satan and open Paradise when you open Paradise the Saints in Paradise saw him each and every one of them praise God described him the way he saw him amen some said you are the pillar of some said you are the will in the midle some say you are the Fourth Man some say you are a tree planted next to the well you are The Rock when amen he said I am all what you have said let's let's go he took them out of paradise when he when he resurrect they resurrected with some people saw that then when he rose up when he rise up they rise up with him amen he he go up with he goes up with them then he left them at the at the sixth Dimension there the sixth Dimension by themed by them [Music] then he left them there he went to the seven according to Paul in the book of Thessalonians he said the Lord himself shall move from the seven dimension [Music] [Music] oh [Music] fx6 zp [Applause] me [Music]
