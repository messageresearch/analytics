TRANSCRIPT
========================================
came down the he took the body of time so he shed his blood to redeem this [Music] G so that he can bring back men to his original [Music] post amen and he did that with brother coming tode now in Eden with Adam was there [Music] mediator no it was God and his son [Music] and the Book of Luke chter I don't know 38 so it tell that Adam was the son of [Music] God Amen am okay let me read it for you Adam Adam was the son of God so he didn't need a [Music] mediator there was between [Music] and but after the sin then God brought in a mediator until the end of [Music] redemption right so I'm trying to read to you Luke 3: 38 it's coming down of theology now here it says who was the son of Enos verse 38 Luke 3: 38 who was the son of So Adam was the son of not a not a son the Son of God then he fall he left the post amen so that's why God came down the seven steps he established seven steps for us okay now let's come here again now the prophet says God and man is now one [Music] here okay then he says he God don't just change it's God in is manifestation you can't call it manifestation until it is in that's then when it is manifestation you can't call it a revelation until God is in that's when we say it's a revelation you can't call it a fulfillment until that way is made flesh that's why it's called fulfillment before that it's not fulfill because it's not yet in flesh right now I'll read something here now when you reach the heart amen because we looking yesterday of how the seventh SE was open theeven open theal that's why it because it's the one that open the amen now we let's go down this way now I will read from the book the unity of one God in the one church because it also tells me that H when God comes to men com to [Music] their now we have two things here we have what we call men and we have what we call the [Music] heart searat them he says your soul in your heart another [Music] man amen so we read that yesterday the throne the third Throne is in your soul got nothing to do with this man this one is controlled by five senses sayses and blood shall not inherit theom [Music] of see Paul says there is another men and he says that man went to the third heaven and tell that was that the in part of Paul went to the [Music] thir this one is [Music] natural only that's why I can say to you I live in South Africa I live in South Africa my house is there but will you believe me if I say to you I can see my house right while standing here [Music] you don't believe that means you can't see your house and if you if you don't have a vision of your house afraid you are going to get lost when you leave because your house is programmed in you now you must take me to your house because it's not programmed in me if it's my first time to go to your house I need somebody to me there because it is not programmed in [Music] me can go to your house because it's programed in him that's how we are going to heaven you are to go something pred in you you know when Jesus was coming to John the Bible says John saw Jesus coming unto him because that thing wasam Mahan woman she said to Jesus I perceive you are a prophet and she went to tell the people and said come and see the who didn't see Jesus as the Mah but this woman recogniz Jesus as Mah say she had a representation she said I know the Messiah come and when he has come he he will tell us all and she was a prostitute while waiting for the Messiah and mahog the Messiah and protitution stopped so that thing was brother says God after he made you he has put a little Stone in you a little white stone so that in due time he will come and he will come to that stone and that stone will make a contact if you don't have that stone must something has put [Music] you when that woman met the Lord Jesus he says it was the two texts coming together two pieces of paper okay amen the Lord has one part and the woman had one so the Jesus comes with another part and it couldn't fit with a it couldn't Fe in the syue he that woman and she said to the people come and see all her problems were gone all her problems gone because she made cont you know how Paul when he was called his way to arrest the Christian amen and God made the road block for him and arrested him stopped him on his amen because he Paul made a contact with [Music] light then he become Paul the first messenger after cont all right now it's for men to make a contact not only not only to hear but make a contacte amen now now now it says here now we are looking at how God operates from their heart after he come amen we were looking at this even yesterday that brother [Music] says theed they wanted to see Jesus now he says they couldn't see he says actually they wanted to see God but they couldn't see God because he was in a human body now he says you can't see God in that way amen then he says what confused them and the Jew was that God was in a he says now when they come to see God see amen so they come to Jesus expecting to see God they they see aen and they say is this not this Joseph son is is is this not his brothers John then they say to him you being a man you make yourself God to them he was a man they could see inside so if you can't see inside you can only see a man say something here in the book The Same Book he says at page 6046 Christ is the of God revealed John the Baptist that great prophet come for and said there is one standing among you right now anary somewhere amen because he says look John never known Jesus being for the Holy Ghost pointing him out okay now let's look at this here is Jesus standing there and many people there now John is looking around because he must introduce the Messiah now Jesus looks like any [Music] other so can't introduce somebody that he he doesn't know now he he's looking around says he was looking with the eyes of an eagle so an eag can see he was looking around some people came some look like they could be be the Messiah but John couldn't recognize him and John says I didn't know him joh one says I did not know him because he couldn't know him as maning there until there was a supernatural and when the spirit come like Ave Jesus joh said now that is the L of god hee brother tells me that Abraham Abraham standing by the um door of the tent then he was looking away because he says what do you see when you look so he was looking away then he saw three Bs of Life saw that Abraham saw three balls of Life Abraham saw three balls of life then they were coming down and he says and Abraham saw him when he step into [Music] flesh amen John saw him when he stepped Upon Jesus that man was an ordinary man recognize him as [Music] came then Abraham said to Sarah sah prepare some food amen because El is now a man [Music] can eat [Music] now but before El could eat was that light could not eat that light could not e in the flesh and they brought food to El and said so now that is now you cannot recognize him unless you see first the supernal why he came to the bride [Music] [Music] super then you will see him in the body in the the coming of the Lord is this the coming of the Lord brother says he will never step his we meet him in the a will not [Music] come now he say the seventh seal brought him and it's a problem for the denominations and the people it was a problem for the Jews 3 said the god you seek and they were waiting at Solomon's Temple there and he came [Music] the and they crucified that Temple to get of God they didn't believe the coming of the they believed it in writing didn't see it that's why the three Maj they came following a you could see it down [Music] here they come in Jerusalem and in Jerusalem they found the readers they they they just kept on reading amen and now the they came with another type of ministry so in the synagogue they had their scroll so they open the [Music] scroll and they look at the and say where is [Music] amen Pharisees thean the priest the were still in that script dispensation just without aill amen that's why said I have heard but now I you can't just keep keep on hearing it must bring you to a manifestation now because hearing alone is not a complete amen so I sent the people one day I was traving with young man now we were passing somewhere there was a construction now he says to me a hospital is coming there they building a hospital so I hear and I just waited for because I knew I knew this between I know that I must go the whole hearing and sing [Music] Hallelujah you hear you see okay so when the thing was completed the building in Ace [Music] station not Hospital what [Music] IP but now what I see is police station so hearing is part of the whole thing but it's not [Music] haveen before you can say this is this you must hear and see then you [Music] know let's read this before we can stood an ordinary man and he could not recognize all right now let's look at this as we are still going to continue now the prophet says because the message was coming to the bride amen amen the destination of the word because the word is seed the destination of the [Music] seed the male is a [Music] se but he cannot multiply until he finds a female [Music] and said it's good because if if there's no female he will just remain alone no multiplication already was out mtip so the [Music] SE alone he couldn't MP all right he had to find a female now as we have seen yesterday am coming to pick up the the bride for [Music] Christ wasck up women came to draw water amen when there was okay now am we said y passing he [Music] to because was the destination of amen and the ministry of elah SE [Music] there now made a [Music] contact she said [Music] who and said it's my master she got off the C like say you can have your now I [Music] see amen and you don't hear of the message amen hallu the [Music] message to now let's look at this now yesterday we saw we look at what brother that that is revelation 5 took the book within
