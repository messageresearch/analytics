[36:54] Gracious
[36:57] Lord, as the song says, Father,
[37:01] that your grace is so sufficient for
[37:05] us. That is why Lord
[37:09] Almighty, we are
[37:12] here. There's a
[37:15] pool that comes directly from your
[37:18] heart, Lord Almighty. Oh my God.
[37:23] In order to cool pull us Lord Almighty
[37:26] towards yourself.
[37:29] We are so grateful for this
[37:32] mind of Christ that is in us.
[37:37] We are so grateful father to live at the
[37:40] end of time
[37:42] where father you showed us everything.
[37:47] We are so grateful Lord Almighty to be
[37:50] in this dispensation
[37:54] where Lord
[37:57] Almighty your
[38:00] word is revealed gracious Lord
[38:04] [Music]
[38:06] and where your word is activated
[38:10] and where your word Lord
[38:12] Almighty is
[38:15] life. You once said that the words that
[38:19] you speak they are spirit
[38:23] and those words are alive.
[38:26] Father we receive life unto thee
[38:30] for we have found you
[38:33] as per promise that he who has found you
[38:37] has found life.
[38:41] We are gathered here this morning
[38:43] Lord with a zeal that is within us
[38:49] with a power that you have given
[38:52] us with a knowledge and understanding of
[38:55] why we are here
[38:58] and with the recognition that you
[39:01] are backing up Lord in whatever we're
[39:05] doing
[39:07] as we sing Lord Almighty
[39:10] We find our position Lord as
[39:14] promised. As we meditate, my gracious
[39:18] Lord, that takes us back to our position
[39:22] where we come from.
[39:24] We are so grateful.
[39:28] So many people are hovering
[39:32] around trying to find peace
[39:36] trying to find a place of worship.
[39:40] Trying to find order,
[39:43] trying to find discipline.
[39:46] Father, you gave us order.
[39:49] You gave us discipline.
[39:52] You gave us a place of worship.
[39:54] Hallelujah. You gave us a revealed word.
[39:59] You gave us at the right time, at the
[40:03] relevant time.
[40:05] That is why Father, we bring glory unto
[40:09] thee, Lord.
[40:11] Thank you, Lord, for what you have done.
[40:14] We are gathered here as your children,
[40:18] as your bride.
[40:21] We commit Lord Almighty this moment unto
[40:24] thee.
[40:26] We don't talk about the devil is
[40:28] outdated.
[40:33] We don't talk about the demons. They
[40:35] have failed.
[40:38] We are concentrating on going away.
[40:43] We'd like to thank you,
[40:45] Father, for giving us such power
[40:50] and such revelation
[40:52] at this time.
[40:55] As you are about to descend, Lord, and
[40:57] take your position
[41:00] behind the pullpit.
[41:03] Thank you, Father. It is yours
[41:08] and even our hearts are yours.
[41:11] You've given us Lord the spiritual
[41:14] hearing. Amen. You've given us a
[41:17] spiritual food in due season.
[41:20] Hallelujah. Oh Lord almighty. Thank you
[41:22] father. And even the songs that you've
[41:25] given us
[41:27] they touch us. Gracious heavenly father.
[41:30] Amen. That shows that Lord
[41:32] Almighty is a blessing.
[41:35] that you have given us when praises go
[41:39] up
[41:41] your joy comes into our heart.
[41:45] Thank you father. May you be with each
[41:48] and everyone
[41:50] that is in this building. Lord
[41:53] bless him or her abundantly.
[41:57] May you close those door with the light.
[42:00] Lord Almighty,
[42:03] the power of the logos. Lord Almighty,
[42:07] may you engage us all to the word that
[42:10] is going to be preached today, which is
[42:13] the reason why we are here, Lord. Thank
[42:16] you, Father. May you put that little
[42:19] voice, Lord Almighty,
[42:21] in our hearts,
[42:24] the voice that heard by Elijah
[42:27] when he was hiding on the cave, Lord.
[42:30] A still small voice. Lord Almighty
[42:34] touched his heart and he went out.
[42:37] Father, may we have the engagement that
[42:40] you had with our father Abraham.
[42:45] There was a lot that you gave of. There
[42:47] was a day that you gave of
[42:49] himself. And today, Lord Almighty, we
[42:53] are at the meeting place. It reminds us
[42:56] Lord Almighty on the day when you met
[42:59] Abraham
[43:01] and who you have met us Lord and gave us
[43:04] of yourself.
[43:06] Thank you father for we pray in the
[43:10] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:13] Amen.
[43:16] Amen.

[2:53:00] 15. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it
[2:53:04] shall be forever. Nothing can be put to
[2:53:07] it, nor anything taken from it. And God
[2:53:11] doeth it that men should fear before
[2:53:14] him. That which hath been is now, and
[2:53:18] that which is to be hath already been,
[2:53:21] and God requireth that which is passed.
[2:53:25] Amen. Amen. God require
[2:53:29] that which is passed. The past.
[2:53:34] Amen. Amen. Amen.

[2:53:48] And said rejoice.
[2:53:51] You may be
[2:53:53] seated. God bless
[2:53:56] you. What a wonderful God we serve.
[2:54:03] I just read this
[2:54:05] part. Uh the Lord
[2:54:09] willing we shall
[2:54:11] continue next time.
[2:54:17] Firstly, man has
[2:54:20] lost the sight
[2:54:23] of his image
[2:54:28] image because you know it so special
[2:54:33] just to look at
[2:54:38] him before he opens his
[2:54:43] mouth as a predestinated seat.
[2:54:50] You you would have heard
[2:54:53] already what he has
[2:55:00] said. How can you miss to honor such a
[2:55:06] God that even even before he
[2:55:11] speaks you say amen. Amen.
[2:55:16] Why?
[2:55:17] Because he made sure
[2:55:20] that you are part of him.
[2:55:24] Maybe you don't understand being a
[2:55:28] part before I he says
[2:55:32] hallelujah hallelujah or before I say
[2:55:36] hallelujah.
[2:55:38] I have heard hallelujah already.
[2:55:44] Uh you remember that scripture where
[2:55:49] uh it says
[2:55:52] God
[2:55:53] created the garden of Eden.
[2:55:57] Now continue and you will hear what what
[2:56:01] what he say. Amen. Genesis chapter
[2:56:05] 2:8. And the Lord God planted a garden
[2:56:08] eastward in Eden, and there he put the
[2:56:12] man whom he had fought.
[2:56:15] Amen. Amen. Oh, seated already. Thank
[2:56:18] you. God bless you. Amen.
[2:56:21] The Lord The Lord planted the garden.
[2:56:24] Planted a garden. Amen. Is what? He
[2:56:27] didn't go around looking for a garden.
[2:56:32] No. A gardener.
[2:56:36] He he didn't go around
[2:56:39] looking for a gardener.
[2:56:44] Amen. Amen. So he hired himself.
[2:56:52] But we were in
[2:56:57] him. He didn't establish a college for
[2:57:00] us.
[2:57:05] But he made us in this
[2:57:09] way that everything he is about to say,
[2:57:15] we are together with him.
[2:57:19] Amen. Amen.
[2:57:22] There's a song that says,
[2:57:25] "Amen." You know it. Which says,
[2:57:29] "All right, God bless you." Amen. When
[2:57:32] you remember, I remember it. I'll come
[2:57:35] back to you the church of God. Amen. We
[2:57:39] are so glad that the Lord Jesus is
[2:57:42] coming.
[2:57:52] Amen. That's why.
[2:57:56] Amen. That's
[2:57:58] why it
[2:58:00] keep keeps us in
[2:58:04] [Music]
[2:58:07] tears that some sing and say how long
[2:58:10] how
[2:58:13] long those who know
[2:58:16] him they sing this
[2:58:20] songs I'll be ready when Jesus comes.
[2:58:28] just for a sentence
[2:58:32] to say the Lord Jesus is coming.
[2:58:39] Amen. Amen. To us is a full
[2:58:45] gospel just to say he is
[2:58:48] coming. Amen.
[2:58:51] That's why there's such a joy in heaven.
[2:58:58] You won't think of coming back
[2:59:03] here. Once you can go to
[2:59:06] heaven, you will never think of coming
[2:59:08] back here.
[2:59:11] [Applause]
[2:59:14] But there are
[2:59:16] some who are
[2:59:18] there in
[2:59:20] him. That's why they won't
[2:59:27] fail because they were in
[2:59:33] him. Not in his house in his.
[2:59:37] He was in
[2:59:39] him in his
[2:59:43] garden. Amen. Amen. In everything he
[2:59:48] is. How many love
[2:59:53] Jesus? All right. Amen. The world can go
[2:59:56] there and
[2:59:57] there. I will never because I have
[3:00:01] tasted of
[3:00:05] him that to be his
[3:00:08] child and not his
[3:00:12] neighbor. We are not his
[3:00:15] neighbors. We are
[3:00:18] his
[3:00:21] children. Amen. The royal family of
[3:00:26] God. Hey children of Abraham,
[3:00:31] you know the children of Abraham,
[3:00:35] they were always
[3:00:38] rejoicing because the Bible
[3:00:42] says he looked for a
[3:00:46] city, not for a
[3:00:51] location. In Christ, we don't look for a
[3:00:54] location.
[3:00:56] We look for our city.
[3:01:01] Amen. Amen. And
[3:01:03] now because God has created that city
[3:01:10] already, you know
[3:01:12] before he could lead you to that
[3:01:17] city. He the seat was already in you.
[3:01:24] So that's why you are not being pushed
[3:01:26] to the
[3:01:28] sea. God won't say to his
[3:01:31] child, "Repent or I kill you or you
[3:01:35] don't want enter." No, no, no, no.
[3:01:38] That's to a
[3:01:42] sinner. But to
[3:01:45] his things are in his children.
[3:01:50] [Music]
[3:01:54] That's
[3:01:56] why if you I were asked to choose a
[3:02:00] pastor,
[3:02:05] I would pass I I
[3:02:07] would choose
[3:02:10] the one who is in
[3:02:14] me and I am in you.
[3:02:19] That's right.
[3:02:22] You know, before you
[3:02:24] think God has already passed over,
[3:02:30] but let's say to the child of
[3:02:33] God before God can say
[3:02:37] something. You have heard him
[3:02:42] already because you are part of him.
[3:02:47] That's
[3:02:48] why it is not repeat repeated to
[3:02:52] you. I said
[3:02:54] repent. No
[3:02:57] with a child of God. It's not. I said
[3:03:03] repent. I'm standing here
[3:03:07] like searching myself. My
[3:03:13] innermost so that my innermost
[3:03:17] should
[3:03:18] not get off the way of the
[3:03:22] Lord. But I'm not looking for
[3:03:26] that
[3:03:27] because if you are predestinated of
[3:03:31] God the law of God is already in
[3:03:36] you, you should not
[3:03:39] repent. Do this, do that, then you are
[3:03:42] not a child of God.
[3:03:46] Because if you are
[3:03:48] predestinated that means before God
[3:03:52] could say
[3:03:54] it is in
[3:03:57] you.
[3:04:00] [Applause]
[3:04:03] Amen. Jesus Christ the same yesterday.
[3:04:09] You'll never find him
[3:04:11] angry. Angry. No.
[3:04:15] So now I will read this
[3:04:19] part and
[3:04:21] uh in love towards the brethren.
[3:04:27] Here's something else here.
[3:04:31] Uh did we
[3:04:33] read which scripture did you read?
[3:04:37] God requireth that which is passed.
[3:04:40] Amen. Yes. Amen.
[3:04:43] God. Hey, did you hear
[3:04:47] he require that
[3:04:53] that is which is past which is
[3:04:56] passed. He will never come to you with a
[3:04:58] new thing
[3:05:02] and struggle to say didn't you hear I
[3:05:05] said no no no
[3:05:08] no what he speaks is already
[3:05:13] new but only what he will
[3:05:18] do is is to bring it in the form of a
[3:05:24] word but it's already
[3:05:29] All right. Amen. Every time we come to
[3:05:31] the service,
[3:05:33] we come with an expectation.
[3:05:38] Okay. Amen. I said I want I don't even
[3:05:41] have to look to the wristwatch because
[3:05:44] I'm I'm already almost there.
[3:05:49] Now that's why they say man has lost the
[3:05:53] sight of his image.
[3:05:59] All right. Amen. Did you hear?
[3:06:03] Man has lost
[3:06:05] the sight of his
[3:06:08] image. My image is
[3:06:11] Christ. Your image is
[3:06:14] Christ. Amen. Amen. So it is impossible
[3:06:18] for you to
[3:06:20] lose his
[3:06:22] image because it is by
[3:06:27] predestination. It is not you are you
[3:06:31] are not a scholar in
[3:06:36] Christ. A scholar can fail
[3:06:40] this. Amen. Amen. But a son is the blood
[3:06:44] of his own
[3:06:48] father. That that's a son. The blood of
[3:06:52] his
[3:06:53] father. We are the blood of
[3:06:57] Christ.
[3:06:59] So you can't say to the blood of
[3:07:02] Christ, bring tithe to love your
[3:07:06] brother. No, that won't work with the
[3:07:09] child of God.
[3:07:13] He was born with that thing in
[3:07:18] mind. If you plant a seed, you don't
[3:07:22] say, "I plant you." And I tell
[3:07:27] you, I want you to bring that
[3:07:31] wheat, no, that's not the wheat. That's
[3:07:34] not
[3:07:35] wheat. Wheat is seed already.
[3:07:39] You just plant it.
[3:07:41] in order to do what? To
[3:07:45] grow. Amen. That's right. Amen. After
[3:07:49] planting, you don't see
[3:07:52] whe I don't I won't beg you come
[3:07:59] forth. No. Once you plant you
[3:08:04] plant, the law is all is is already
[3:08:08] working.
[3:08:12] Mhm. Amen. Hey, our God is wonderful.
[3:08:16] Once you hear the
[3:08:18] gospel, not the church
[3:08:21] gospel, the seed
[3:08:26] gospel. You didn't hear. I didn't hear
[3:08:30] the seed.
[3:08:32] The
[3:08:32] seed. What we God
[3:08:36] wants is seed to serve him. The Bible
[3:08:41] says this seed shall serve
[3:08:46] [Applause]
[3:08:48] you
[3:08:50] and you don't force the seed of God to
[3:08:54] serve you.
[3:08:57] No, it is the
[3:08:59] working of the seed of
[3:09:02] God that's in you that will do the
[3:09:08] job. But you know, you see
[3:09:13] sometimes I used to worship at certain
[3:09:17] denomination.
[3:09:20] Everything is forced upon
[3:09:24] you. Don't wear mini skirt. Hallelujah.
[3:09:28] Don't. No. That's not God
[3:09:32] seat. God's seat is the
[3:09:37] word. It's not what a preacher force you
[3:09:40] to
[3:09:41] do. No,
[3:09:45] it is God. You know, brother. Yes, sir.
[3:09:50] uh he planted seed
[3:09:54] seed
[3:09:56] he planted seed he didn't ask any farmer
[3:10:02] to because that farmer that farmer can
[3:10:05] even
[3:10:06] plant
[3:10:08] [Music]
[3:10:14] marijuana so it should be his own seat
[3:10:21] That's why God hates
[3:10:28] [Music]
[3:10:29] adultery. For God never said to
[3:10:33] somebody, "Plant me a
[3:10:36] seed." No, he is his own
[3:10:43] seat. A real child of God.
[3:10:47] is not forced to do any good
[3:10:50] thing. It is the seed the nature in him.
[3:10:59] Amen. Amen. You know there at the
[3:11:04] denominations you are taught to recite
[3:11:07] what do you call it?
[3:11:12] Prayer after a teacher.
[3:11:17] for God loved the
[3:11:20] world. Then you say after
[3:11:24] him, you don't have it. You say it
[3:11:29] after the teacher with God is
[3:11:36] not what he
[3:11:38] says. It's already in you.
[3:11:43] He doesn't come and plow.
[3:11:47] Then after
[3:11:48] afterwards he says there you see
[3:11:52] I work hard for
[3:11:54] you. No no no
[3:11:56] no. No the seed of
[3:12:01] God has God's
[3:12:07] life in it.
[3:12:11] Yeah. A a brother one time
[3:12:15] Uh he was talking
[3:12:18] about something in the church
[3:12:24] uh which is not good for
[3:12:28] a
[3:12:31] believer to
[3:12:35] wear. After some few
[3:12:38] days she was back on it.
[3:12:43] Amen. Amen. Then I said, "Brother,
[3:12:48] I was talking to a brother. I said, you
[3:12:51] know, the seed of
[3:12:52] God, uh, you don't force
[3:12:56] it. A person you have forced to do
[3:12:59] something is not a
[3:13:05] Christian. A Christian is not forced to
[3:13:08] do
[3:13:09] right. That is his life.
[3:13:14] Amen. Amen.
[3:13:16] You don't force wheat to become
[3:13:19] wheat. No, it is wheat
[3:13:24] whether you water it or
[3:13:27] not and then God will water you if it is
[3:13:32] a
[3:13:33] righteous
[3:13:34] seed. Now in
[3:13:37] closing as I have
[3:13:40] promised
[3:13:42] now here the Bible
[3:13:45] says
[3:13:47] h if a
[3:13:50] man keep my
[3:13:53] saying he shall never see
[3:14:00] death. Amen. Because you
[3:14:02] know if God says something to
[3:14:06] you, it is both
[3:14:08] seed,
[3:14:10] life,
[3:14:12] resurrection. You know his seed is like
[3:14:14] that.
[3:14:18] So he he will plant once
[3:14:24] seed
[3:14:26] life. Amen. Amen.
[3:14:29] If then it is
[3:14:32] needful for you to have resurrection
[3:14:37] resurrection, it is in that seat.
[3:14:44] Sit. Okay. Amen. Now before I close
[3:14:50] here, it is like I remember one day I
[3:14:53] was at the
[3:14:55] church and
[3:14:57] uh the man there was
[3:15:02] battling with the members in his church.
[3:15:09] If you don't bring tithes,
[3:15:13] then
[3:15:17] he threw the the tie from.
[3:15:22] Amen. Amen.
[3:15:26] He's
[3:15:27] tired because of anger.
[3:15:33] You think I just come here to
[3:15:37] play? Now I was with brother I
[3:15:42] said this is not God's word
[3:15:47] and it's not God's church
[3:15:51] God's
[3:15:53] church is not
[3:16:01] shamb if you plant in your
[3:16:09] You don't say
[3:16:12] I'm here I don't want to hear
[3:16:17] anything then we will say we take table
[3:16:28] and sit down.
[3:16:30] Yeah.
[3:16:33] And some saying
[3:16:35] Leave him to preach
[3:16:37] on say he's not preaching.
[3:16:41] He's not preaching.
[3:16:44] After you have
[3:16:46] planted in your
[3:16:48] garden, we don't hear while passing by.
[3:16:54] We hear
[3:16:55] you saying, "I have planted you and
[3:17:04] we will take you out of the
[3:17:07] garden." No sir. Yeah. Take and go
[3:17:11] arrested.
[3:17:13] Yeah. This is church. I started but this
[3:17:16] is not of God.
[3:17:20] It's a church. But it's not of God. It
[3:17:23] is your
[3:17:30] [Applause]
[3:17:33] the Lord Jesus
[3:17:35] doesn't push us
[3:17:38] in order to do right.
[3:17:41] We are a
[3:17:43] seed. Amen. That's why Bible says the
[3:17:46] seed of Abraham,
[3:17:52] he didn't buy it from
[3:17:56] the seed of Abraham
[3:18:00] shall
[3:18:01] produce seed
[3:18:05] Abraham. Mhm. Amen. If it is of Abraham,
[3:18:10] it will bring forth the nature
[3:18:14] [Music]
[3:18:15] of the same seat
[3:18:19] because that's how bring God does
[3:18:23] things. Mhm.
[3:18:25] You don't have to
[3:18:28] struggle a brother one
[3:18:30] day when I was with the Assemblies of
[3:18:34] God people there
[3:18:37] uh we were going we were going somewhere
[3:18:40] for a revival
[3:18:44] Then he said to me, "Hey
[3:18:47] brother, you know this young
[3:18:51] people is better if they can ask me to
[3:18:54] preach."
[3:18:56] Yeah. I said, "No, no,
[3:18:59] brother. The
[3:19:01] seed of God came from
[3:19:07] God. You don't make it a seed. Amen.
[3:19:14] You water.
[3:19:17] Amen. Amen. The the Lord has produced
[3:19:22] it. Your job is just to water.
[3:19:28] But a seed that came through that
[3:19:33] force. Amen. Amen.
[3:19:36] Be baptized in life.
[3:19:46] Um, I know I I was with such
[3:19:50] things until I said to
[3:19:53] God,
[3:19:56] "Lord, if then this is the
[3:19:58] way I should go to
[3:20:01] heaven, then I sorry."
[3:20:04] [Applause]
[3:20:06] Amen. Amen. Then when I
[3:20:10] The first spoken word I have
[3:20:14] received God of this evil
[3:20:19] age I remain home and said if
[3:20:24] then man is to be
[3:20:27] forced to become a child of God then I
[3:20:31] won't go that
[3:20:34] way and then
[3:20:37] afterwards when I started now to read
[3:20:40] the
[3:20:42] Bible wanting to see
[3:20:48] it. Then I found the truth.
[3:20:52] Since
[3:20:54] then
[3:20:57] I just relaxed.
[3:21:01] Amen. Amen.
[3:21:03] You know a
[3:21:04] seed once it can do
[3:21:07] something it in turn corrects
[3:21:13] itself because it has the nature of
[3:21:20] God. Amen. Amen.
[3:21:24] Now I was with my
[3:21:28] friend Johannes.
[3:21:32] Then they were going to attend this what
[3:21:34] they call youth services.
[3:21:39] If you can ask the people
[3:21:42] today maybe coming
[3:21:44] from what they call
[3:21:48] revival you hear them
[3:21:52] complaining. I'm talking about things
[3:21:55] that I have
[3:21:58] experienced. I was with a brother
[3:22:02] So uh we were going somewhere
[3:22:06] now. He said let us pass by my father's
[3:22:10] house because my younger
[3:22:13] brother he's attending a revival
[3:22:18] somewhere. Amen. Amen. So I said yes
[3:22:21] brother but because we are going
[3:22:22] somewhere it should not be a prolonged.
[3:22:27] All right. Amen.
[3:22:29] While I was waiting for the brother with
[3:22:32] a hot coffee outside
[3:22:35] there, the young
[3:22:37] man has just
[3:22:40] arrived a younger brother to the
[3:22:44] morning.
[3:22:46] Amen. Amen. While we were there,
[3:22:51] I heard from inside the house
[3:22:56] the father Their father was not a
[3:23:01] believer. Is this Lutheran you
[3:23:05] know they preach only after they have
[3:23:09] taken at last.
[3:23:13] So in the
[3:23:15] house the father was shouting to his
[3:23:22] son I will never give you money again
[3:23:25] for going to this church of
[3:23:30] yours then that one no daddy what must I
[3:23:33] do if I don't go to church it's the same
[3:23:37] thing you go to church you come back you
[3:23:40] are still cheeky you are still
[3:23:43] Now I don't see any difference.
[3:23:47] I'll keep my money.
[3:23:52] Yeah. And he was uh coming out of the
[3:23:57] house saying this and that and that.
[3:24:01] And the older elder brother says my
[3:24:07] father is
[3:24:08] angry. I said why?
[3:24:12] says, "Didn't you hear her shouting?" I
[3:24:15] said, "Yes, I did."
[3:24:18] Says, "My father,
[3:24:21] if you go to church, he believed that
[3:24:25] coming back from church, you are a
[3:24:27] better
[3:24:32] Christian." I said,
[3:24:34] "No." Uh, does this what you call
[3:24:50] Yeah, mar. Yes, that's right.
[3:24:55] Now this young man,
[3:24:58] you yourself told me that your younger
[3:25:01] brother smokes
[3:25:05] marijuana. Now what do you expect?
[3:25:10] All right. He says,
[3:25:12] "Brother, now what do you think we
[3:25:15] should do now?" I said, "No, he must
[3:25:20] believe God. Give his life to
[3:25:24] God.
[3:25:26] Otherwise, he'll keep on
[3:25:29] smoking. Even the the day he's coming
[3:25:33] back home from
[3:25:35] somewhere, he will bring he will smoke
[3:25:41] too much of this
[3:25:43] stuff in preparation to ask to answer
[3:25:46] his father.
[3:25:52] When he opens the father at night time,
[3:25:56] he says, "Yeah, I knew I knew.
[3:26:00] You see father now
[3:26:03] how can I love you if you treat me
[3:26:10] well he
[3:26:12] says trying to treat you well
[3:26:17] is just to I be treating marijuana
[3:26:26] well all Right.
[3:26:29] Let me come to the end of this until
[3:26:33] we
[3:26:35] we I have promised.
[3:26:38] Now in the
[3:26:40] Bible, we read about seeds,
[3:26:45] the
[3:26:46] seed of Abraham.
[3:26:49] Now if God don't trust
[3:26:52] Abraham, he will never say such words.
[3:26:59] Because the people will come tomorrow
[3:27:00] and say, "Didn't you say he's the city
[3:27:03] of
[3:27:06] God?" Well, let let us give him
[3:27:11] chance. Do you do you give seed
[3:27:16] chance? No, it is
[3:27:19] seed. Chance and all this are in this
[3:27:26] You don't have a seed.
[3:27:30] You don't have outside of this seat
[3:27:34] something
[3:27:35] outside to make it
[3:27:39] better.
[3:27:40] No seed. You don't paint
[3:27:44] seed. No,
[3:27:47] you don't become polite to the
[3:27:50] seed in order to make it better.
[3:27:54] The seed of
[3:27:56] God will spiritually resemble
[3:28:03] God. Uh-huh. Amen. So that's how it
[3:28:06] should be
[3:28:07] like. Now in closing here that's why I
[3:28:13] read some here
[3:28:17] says man has
[3:28:19] lost the sight of his image.
[3:28:24] Then I said, "Yeah,
[3:28:27] that's but it doesn't work for a
[3:28:33] sinner." Because sinner, a sinner is not
[3:28:36] the image of
[3:28:41] God. He was
[3:28:43] born a seed.
[3:28:46] If it is of
[3:28:47] God then you know some
[3:28:51] people they believe I say I will tell
[3:28:54] brief something
[3:28:57] here in Modi where I used to live.
[3:29:03] There was this old
[3:29:05] man, a very good old
[3:29:09] man. And now I every time talking to his
[3:29:14] children would say be like me. Can't you
[3:29:19] see that
[3:29:22] I'm pray
[3:29:29] for? Yeah. Pray for us.
[3:29:33] Then before they eat, they bring food
[3:29:37] before they eat. Yeah, we also want to
[3:29:41] be like
[3:29:43] you would say. All right, let's pray.
[3:29:47] Oh, heavenly father,
[3:29:51] not knowing that he's referring to his
[3:29:54] father.
[3:29:59] Amen. Amen.
[3:30:02] Okay. Now, yes, the not the end of it,
[3:30:07] but we will look at it next time.
[3:30:12] Man has lost
[3:30:15] the sight of
[3:30:18] his image.
[3:30:23] The image of God
[3:30:26] or the image of a child of
[3:30:30] God is is Christ is God. Is Christ.
[3:30:37] Now if it is the
[3:30:39] image it is born an
[3:30:44] image you don't nothing can make a seat
[3:30:47] him a seat.
[3:30:51] Hey, let me say this. Brothers and
[3:30:54] sisters,
[3:30:57] do you know that
[3:30:59] nothing can make somebody a
[3:31:05] Christian?
[3:31:07] No. You can buy somebody some suits and
[3:31:10] what
[3:31:11] what say my son, you know, if you can go
[3:31:14] to church in ah you'll see wonders.
[3:31:21] yesterday in his
[3:31:23] mind he is thinking of a that he has
[3:31:27] seen.
[3:31:32] Yeah. Amen.
[3:31:34] If you can say to your
[3:31:36] child, if you can do the right
[3:31:40] thing, I'll buy I'll buy you a suit. A
[3:31:45] suit. Yes, daddy. What do you want me to
[3:31:48] do, daddy?
[3:31:52] Not that he wants to do a good thing.
[3:31:55] No, he wants a
[3:32:00] suit and the father say, son, I'll get
[3:32:04] you one right
[3:32:07] now. The father will rush to town to buy
[3:32:12] him a
[3:32:13] suit. When he arrived back with the
[3:32:16] suit, then the boy will say, "Oh,
[3:32:21] daddy, daddy, I love you." He loves the
[3:32:25] suit. Not
[3:32:29] this. Amen. Even after wearing it, you
[3:32:34] say, "Daddy, how do I look like daddy?"
[3:32:37] Amen. Amen. And then daddy said, "Yeah,
[3:32:40] my boy,
[3:32:42] my my son." not knowing that the suit is
[3:32:45] for a girl.
[3:32:49] Girl,
[3:32:51] yeah, it's for a girlfriend.
[3:32:56] The first thing when he leaves
[3:33:00] straight to the

[3:33:31] But this
[3:33:33] love is talking about the love of the
[3:33:35] suit.
[3:33:39] Okay. Amen. Now in closing like this,
[3:33:44] how many love
[3:33:46] God? Amen.
[3:33:49] I am
[3:33:50] loved by
[3:33:53] God. It is
[3:33:56] something you know even when I'm alone
[3:34:01] sometimes you think maybe I am mad or
[3:34:06] what just the joy of being a child of
[3:34:09] God.
[3:34:12] Because if you are a child of God by
[3:34:17] birth is different from
[3:34:20] if
[3:34:22] you call yourself a
[3:34:27] son. Amen.
[3:34:30] By not
[3:34:33] birth. Okay. You know many people that
[3:34:36] are in the
[3:34:38] church they it is not by
[3:34:40] birth because by birth it will say
[3:34:46] you are the seed of Abraham.
[3:34:50] Amen. Then that is by birth but not
[3:34:55] birth of the flesh.
[3:35:00] I was saying to a brother when coming
[3:35:03] here
[3:35:04] That brother
[3:35:07] I've seen somebody wearing a suit
[3:35:11] but he has stolen my money to buy that
[3:35:18] suit. All right.
[3:35:21] Can I read the
[3:35:25] last he bought? He stole money to buy
[3:35:29] that.
[3:35:33] Should I sit next to him and I I hear
[3:35:37] him when the minister
[3:35:39] preach. Amen. Not you.
[3:35:49] No. What have I done? bring my
[3:35:53] soup. Amen. Amen. Then I called the
[3:35:56] deacons and arrest
[3:36:01] him. Okay, brothers and
[3:36:05] sisters. It is so wonderful to be with
[3:36:09] you. You know that's why they say, but I
[3:36:13] won't dwell on this now.
[3:36:16] Man has
[3:36:17] lost the sight of his image.
[3:36:24] Man
[3:36:27] made you in his God made you. God made
[3:36:33] you in his image image.
[3:36:39] But if I can say to you, prove to
[3:36:43] me that he's a child of God,
[3:36:48] how are you going to do
[3:36:51] it? I must preach and see how you
[3:36:57] react. Amen. Amen. That's the only way I
[3:37:03] can prove.
[3:37:04] Yeah. Amen. Because everybody can say,
[3:37:08] "Yeah, I'm also a child of God,
[3:37:10] brother." Yeah. I said, "All right, let
[3:37:12] me preach." After
[3:37:15] preaching, said, "Did you hear the
[3:37:17] gospel?" Yeah.
[3:37:23] But you just stole my
[3:37:26] shoes. I
[3:37:28] [Music]
[3:37:31] was You'll hear some stories.
[3:37:34] Uh I don't want to read further more
[3:37:37] although there is
[3:37:41] still the the the thing we will continue
[3:37:44] with next
[3:37:52] time man has lost
[3:37:57] I I mean men has lost
[3:38:01] the sight of his image.
[3:38:03] God bless you.
[3:38:08] So God
[3:38:10] requires the that which is past the past
[3:38:15] that which is past
[3:38:18] because it will never
[3:38:21] change. It was planted by God.
[3:38:26] Right. Amen. So
[3:38:30] brethren, I won't take it
[3:38:33] further, but the Lord
[3:38:36] willing, we will come back one
[3:38:39] day to continue here and go to
[3:38:43] Genesis. God made
[3:38:45] man in his own
[3:38:49] image. It doesn't say God made man in
[3:38:52] the image
[3:38:54] of his father.
[3:38:58] No, but it says in the image of God in
[3:39:03] his own
[3:39:07] image possibly the
[3:39:10] nature will be of God.
[3:39:15] Now
[3:39:16] if the nature is of
[3:39:19] God like the Lord
[3:39:21] Jesus had apostles
[3:39:26] and did you see how he did
[3:39:29] it just coming there to the was it the
[3:39:33] river or the
[3:39:36] sea and said
[3:39:38] Peter follow me
[3:39:42] because the seed is already
[3:39:48] there. Did you hear him saying, "Hey,
[3:39:50] how are you, sir? Who are you, sir?"
[3:39:53] No, no, no, no, no. Peter, Peter,
[3:39:57] follow
[3:40:00] me. And Peter,
[3:40:03] take the natural fishing staff
[3:40:08] and follow Jesus.
[3:40:13] You know this other one where Jesus said
[3:40:17] before Philip called you Philip called
[3:40:21] I haveen you I've seen
[3:40:27] you Amen.
[3:40:29] meaning that when this man was
[3:40:35] born God was looking
[3:40:41] Now when the time arrive
[3:40:44] you don't hear Jesus
[3:40:47] saying Philip
[3:40:50] quit smoking man
[3:40:52] no you said Philip follow
[3:40:58] me then the Lord turned this way Philip
[3:41:02] just stood up and
[3:41:04] followed to the end of the
[3:41:08] journey if you plant seed
[3:41:16] You plant it. Then you say follow me.
[3:41:22] Next
[3:41:23] week you find that the thing has turned
[3:41:26] to something
[3:41:28] else. So that's not
[3:41:36] which be ready. Let's go higher.
[3:41:43] As we stand up,
[3:41:45] [Applause]
[3:41:48] [Music]
[3:41:53] tell me brother, are you ready?
[3:42:03] [Music]
[3:42:05] I'll be
[3:42:09] ready.
[3:42:11] I'll be
[3:42:13] ready
[3:42:15] when
[3:42:19] she brother. We are closing now.
[3:42:24] It is because myself I am
[3:42:28] ready and I know nothing.
[3:42:33] can turn me around.
[3:42:38] You know, you must have that
[3:42:41] uh what do you call it? Assurance.
[3:42:44] Assurance.
[3:42:46] Because the person you are
[3:42:51] singing you say I'll be listening
[3:42:57] to. Uh there was
[3:43:01] uh
[3:43:03] something at the home of my friend.
[3:43:08] Amen. Amen. But it was not a friend in
[3:43:11] Christ.
[3:43:14] It was a
[3:43:16] friend in
[3:43:18] in the bottle. Amen.
[3:43:24] So his father was a just a Lutheran like
[3:43:29] that, you
[3:43:31] know,
[3:43:34] and we were together one
[3:43:37] day and because I was also still
[3:43:42] young knowing not the right or
[3:43:46] wrong, I
[3:43:48] said, "Are you also a go like your
[3:43:52] father. So yeah, what do you mean? Even
[3:43:56] he bought
[3:43:57] me something last
[3:44:00] week for attending church with
[3:44:03] him. I said, bro, I didn't talk about
[3:44:07] attending
[3:44:10] church. I said, "All right, we'll talk
[3:44:12] one
[3:44:14] day." Uh, invite your family.
[3:44:20] to
[3:44:22] Christ. I didn't say to
[3:44:27] attend. Amen. No, I'm saying talking to
[3:44:32] your family
[3:44:35] men. You don't say,
[3:44:41] uh, don't you want to go to church with
[3:44:44] me?
[3:44:46] No. Tell him, "I want to go to heaven
[3:44:49] with
[3:44:55] you." Because going to church with you
[3:45:00] won't change
[3:45:02] me. But to go to Christ,
[3:45:08] that will change me.
[3:45:11] Amen. Amen.
[3:45:13] Are we up on our feet? Oh, yeah. Yes.
[3:45:15] Amen.

[3:45:46] ready.
[3:45:49] I'll be
[3:45:52] ready.
[3:45:55] I'll be
[3:45:58] ready
[3:46:02] [Music]

[3:46:17] and you just
