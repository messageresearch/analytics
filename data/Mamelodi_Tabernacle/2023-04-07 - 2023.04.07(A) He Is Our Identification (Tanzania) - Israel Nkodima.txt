Title: He Is Our Identification
This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima in Tanzania at Ubungo End Time Message Church. 
Date: 07-04-2023 A

Mark 13: 30 - 37  John 14: 20 -21

The pastor open the sermon by taking a quotation from 63-0728 - Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed

335 That’s the only way you’ll know Him today, only way you’ll get the threefold revelation of God, is for the Holy Ghost. 

And a quotation from 63-0324E - The Seventh Seal   

391 Now, now, do you notice? On the opening of this Seventh Seal, it’s also in a threefold mystery. This one, I have…will speak and have spoke, that it is the mystery of the Seven Thunders. 


The Seven seal when it was opened it was also in a threefold purpose.


We are Identified with Christ in a threefold because we are part of the threefold revelation. 

63-0728 - Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed
516 Then, the Bride-Body must follow the Head, for it is part of His resurrection and part of the mystery. It’s impossible for it not to go. Oh, my! It’s part of God’s mystery, how God revealed Himself here and raised It up by the Word, so He reveals His Church and raising It up by the same Word. It’s a part of His threefold mystery.
He reveals his church and when He is revealed he is his church, His church is also part of him in a threefold mystery.

Every revelation that is revealed is revealed in your soul. The only person who will hear that and receive it he is part of the threefold. Because it is the ministry of the soul. If you are not part of the threefold you will be able to see it, because he said On the opening of the Seventh seal, it's also in a threefold mystery.

According to I John 1: 1 -3 The fellowship we have is also in a threefold. Our fellowship is with the Farther and with his Son Jesus Christ.

know him today I think we all want to know him not just talk about you and now does the prophet speaking that's the only way you'll know him today only way you'll get that threefold revelation of gold so the only way to know him is to get a three-fold revelation of God amen now and there he says we want to find that is Page 21. we want to find out what is this threefold purpose amen now we looking at mark 13. it says of that day and our noeth no man Okay so of that day and the hour no noeth no man now if you tend to join the Book of John 14. there it says at that day you shall know but the 13 Maxes of the of that day already of that day [Music] it falls under one food no one no Angels but the father that's under one fold the father and John says but at that day now not off that day then it says that you shall know [Music] but of that coming day it says no not the angels of heaven but here John says now at that day now you shall know that's one was before the seals were opened the seventh seal and the other one was after it was revealed all right that's what we are looking we are looking at and this part that I was looking at in this book here God bless you um it reached us it says I want to you to notice tonight that in the sixth year there was a three-fold purpose Amen in this in in this a three-fold peoples and the seventh seal also when it was opened it was opened in a three-fold peoples [Music] so that's why he says we want to know what is this threefold people purpose [Music] of the six cells is there another book there please let me read all this so we'll be able

only way you will know him the only way you will get the only way to know him you will get a threefold revelation and if the prophet says that's the only way that means that's the only way I mean there's no other way to know him except I get a threefold revelation amen now uh he puts it clear here what is this threefold Revelation because even the the seventh seal it says do you notice on the OB seven seal it's it's also in a three-fold mystery in a three-fold is opened in a three-fold mystery the seven seal also that is Page 575 in this version amen do you notice on this opening of this seventh season it's also in a three-fold mystery amen then we realize John 14. tell us what is the threefold mystery amen have you realized as you read it John 14 now at that day you know the first one says [Music] at that day you shall know that one the first one said only the father this one says John 14 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and and you in me and I in you threefold amen [Applause] so you are identified with him amen so that is our identity the father hey it's wonderful now he says you shall know and you all know what is to know you should know that he is in the father you in him that's what you should know that he is in the father and you in him and he says [Applause] [Music] amen meaning you are part of the three four and he says you will never know him the only way to know him is he will get a free phone revelation amen isn't he wonderful now page 60 here the same book Christ is the mystery of God revealed he quotes Jesus said at that day amen now you have off that day no no no one knows but at that day then you shall know now Jesus said at that day and he says yeah it's this day that means after the revelation of the Seventh Son [Music] is this day amen at that day that's this day you read it from your page 60 of Christ is the mystery of God Revenge that day when this Revelation is made known when the Revelation is made then you will know that I am in the father and uh and then you and me and I knew part of the threefolds Revelation amen being identified with him in a three-fold Revelation okay now let me finish this part Jesus said yes at that day that is this day all right which day church this this day and when when this Revelation is made known you will know that it's a three-fold one thing in three fold purpose amen even think that that is he he he his church he says that is now we're talking about his church how God that's page 69. right so he says watch then he is the head of the body which is his church Pride then the bright body must follow the head foreign [Music] [Applause] it's impossible for it not to go to go foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign it's one thing in a three-fold and it's called a three-fold revelation of God is the only way you will know him that's when you are part of the threefold that's the only way there's no other way to know apart from being apart of the threefolds amen amen for it is part of his resurrection of his mystery is impossible for it not to go you know brother brand name is you're showing me that day one the bride is so one with him I mean it's even part of him you know we are looking at the family this morning he is the family man and we are part of the family we are not just believers we are part of the family amen he is our King King's Men [Music] amen you know it makes me carry one following we as a member of the family [Music] he Reveals His Church is not just a change it's a revealed one I mean you can find some Churches but this one is a revealed change amen he Reveals His change and raises it up by the same word because he is the word and it's part of his threefold mystery meaning that this church is part of History food which cause he said that that day we shall know that I mean the father and they ruin me and I in you threefold Spirit okay now it says it's part [Music] puts it this way we thank the Lord for that amen and I think it's uh 36 the same I reached this part time and again paragraph 252 page 39 6. his church is himself revealed how how do you hear that brother his church now not a church [Music] but his himself revealed amen when he is revealed it's his church it's him himself revealed he says do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is and you are part in him that's why everything every Revelation is that is revealed in your soul it is revealed in you [Music] that's why he says we want to find out what is this threefold purpose I'll go back to it again when he opened the seventh seal it was in a threefold that's why if I don't have this three-fold I will miss part of it that's why I will say the seventh is because when it is revealed it is in the three four now three four meaning I'm included so how can it be revealed amen so the only person who will hear that and who will receive it is [Applause] amen amen because it is not for intellectuals it is foolish it is the ministry of the Soul the ministry of the sovereign he says bedtime hearing [Music] that's why you as the member of his body amen amen you can hear what you have said before [Applause] what it says do you understand what I'm looking for right [Music] and our hands have handled over the weight of life okay that which was [Music] from [Music] when I was talking to the Church of God there [Music] that the Bible says yes in the beginning was the way now we all know that God has no beginning God has but it says in the beginning was the word I mean and the Word was with God now you are going backwards beginning was the way the weight was with God and they wrote was God amen so you are moving backwards for God has has no beginning we have a far hearing amen that rituals that which was [Music] amen in the beginning was and the word was it was was going backwards all right now we came from there to the red the word was okay when the Bible says amen you know it's not talking about these years it's not this hearing natural amen amen I think we are giving our brother to read just read it from verse 1 to verse 3 in the beginning that that which was from that which was a half from the beginning that's right foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen that which was in the beginning let me follow that which was in the beginning from the beginning yes is wish to have booked according yeah right you know you can't handle that with this hence you can't see that with this eyes you can hear that with this yes for it says in the beginning was the word okay and then how it goes yeah I'll hear that hear that not only to talk about life amen you're talking about the thing that you see life you can see like you have seen because life was manifested [Music] manifested was made known to you so you know what is life [Music] amen if you know what is life then you know how to live before you can know how to live you need to know what is life [Music] and he is here is our life okay he is our yesterday he is our yesterday he is our true today he is our tomorrow yesterday today and foreign [Music] we have not only heard about life but it says we have seen life amen it's something that we have seen we are talking about the things that we have seen it is not right before a Salesman will go out to sell his material sits down and and test it [Music] so that when he goes out he will say it works because he himself has tested now we preach to the people the message of the hour because we have tested it works for us so it worked for us that's why we preach to the people because it was manifested the Bible says to us so you know what is life if you know what is life then you know how to live you can only live that life if you know what is that life okay [Applause] [Music] shall we give you chance to read that part I love that our fellowship is with with the father brother sister your fellowship is with the father end now with his son and now that is our fellowship it's in a three-fold with the father with the son with us [Applause] we are that instruments what the father [Applause] who the father is the father speaks something it's with the sun is with us [Music] amen that's why we we we we don't just preach out of the book it's from the father [Applause] I remember looking for a message you know every minister before I I preach I first I have to pray to God it's not just a thing of reading a quotation and preach no I must get I must contact make a contact you you must take from the father so it runs through the three four our fellowship is read it our fellowship [Music] right our fellowship so it makes it three years with their father and with his son that is our favorite Street it is it is with us but it's one Fellowship at coming in a three-fold [Music] meaning that that's why he said that's that's how the only way we can know him and even his church is himself revealed when he is a three-fold as I reach here we we find out also in this that the Sixth Seal yeah now being open [Music] being open into us for a three-fold a person who is not part of the threefold he cannot understand it [Applause] it should run through the threefold when it is opened do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal is also in a free form [Applause] okay it is the father me you amen amen so you can't know something that the father don't know because it has to run three things the father that's why he said of Abraham he said to Abraham shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do Abraham didn't part of him you could not hide from Abraham if he's going to destroy a Sodom we must take up wrong with him well he said I can't hide from Abraham we can't hide anything from us because we are part of him don't you ever we ever think that God will have a separate a secret meeting somewhere without us [Applause] in every office we are included [Applause] what is going to do he took Abraham and stood with him somewhere and showed him [Applause] woke up in the morning went to the same place where he stood before the Lord and saw suddenly [Applause] amen you know we were even saying when Abraham separated with Lord the Bible says right you still have that scripture still you must have it here if you are part of the three four you know that scripture here and that was Abraham and Lord the problem there with Lord the Bible says Lord has his Abraham had his wow what it says yes [Music] and lot also which went with Abraham had flocks and heads and Tents yeah yeah and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the head men of Abrams remember Adam also Adam had Abraham Abraham also he had his answer yes started where it says Abraham from this one and Abraham went out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lord with him into the South the South and Abram was very rich in cattle in silver and gold and he went on his journey from the south even to Bethel and to the place where he stands had been at the beginning between Bethel and high and to the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and their Abram called on the name of the Lord and Lord also which went with Abram had flocks and heads and Tents and the land was not able to pay them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the herdsmen of upbraham's cattle and the herdsmen of Lords cattle and the Canaanites and the parasites dwelled there in the land and Abraham said unto Lord let there be no strive I pray thee between me and me and between my heads men and thy Health's men for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me now you see where separation is coming from Abraham has his Lord has his it is like in the church God gives the pastor a revelation but you find another ship has also its own revelation amen okay now the thing was Abraham had his Lord also [Music] that's how the people start the church within the church [Music] God has anointed the pastor God has anointed a pastor but there's another one I meant that not but not by God he also has his wife until Abraham said hey my friend no no no no no [Music] let us make some a choice and then he didn't say I separate myself he said you know that will not separation will be an easy go for him amen amen but Abraham could not separate from anything [Applause] he was on a pilgrimage all right then he said to Lord now if you can't go together with me separate yourself [Music] [Applause] the promised land he was not afraid to say you made the first choice if you choose right I'll choose he knew that he will never choose the promises [Applause] [Applause] yes [Music] foreign he chose that place before it was a church Lord let us look at the at Lord's choice he he chose a place before it was destroyed huh say it and lost heating up his eyes and beheld all the pain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and gomon oh that's how the people can choose they choose a place before God destroys him [Applause] mm-hmm Abraham knew that so that's how they separated [Music] and you know until welcome because Abraham was looking for a city [Music] whose maker and Builder is God he didn't just look for a city amen that is he had a supernatural map a city whose maker is God and and the Builder now as he was looking for the city he met the king of that City [Music] amen when he met the king now brother Brandon says a wonderful thing here that the king he gave Abraham what was that Bread and Wine again he says he gave him of himself [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and you know he says I'm glad in the book Hebrews I'm glad I met him [Applause] and he gave me communion he says [Music] now he said who is this who was that and then he said you too should meet you now I surprise the brother when I said I too as brother Brian hey brother Brandon says you too should meet me [Music] but the thing is how because he says [Music] [Applause] what are you saying now when he said who is this oh yeah not that who's this so if I say to you I can't say who is this brother if he is not here I'll always say who is this brother [Applause] amen right he says the revelation of Melchizedek comes into view when their seals were opened [Music] [Applause] meaning he is the person of the being of the Seven Seals [Applause] yeah amen became Jesus now who is this he says then he came as a prophet can you show me Prophet Melchizedek have you ever seen prophet says he came as as a prophet then he says then he says to me came as a prophet now it's easy for me to received because he came as a prophet amen because he says I met him he he gave me Bread and Wine which is himself [Music] he says except You Eat My Flesh and drink my blood you have no life [Applause] he came and said to us except you drove my blood and eat my flesh you have that is giving of himself [Music] [Applause] that's why you know he says he gave Abraham of himself Abraham was blessed this happened right at the literal play sport foreign [Music] is another country somewhere no it's Jerusalem [Music] that's why we'll have to look at the migration of the seed of Abra okay there's a migration of the Seed of Abraham going back home I think we have noticed that the migration of the Seed of Abraham Okay so now we'll take we'll look at the Rapture in faith of what is this rapturing faith okay but today we are here I mean just before we close amen now I think we we I think we are clear there brother when they separated one saw a place before it was destroyed I mean and the other one the promise land for God said he shall never hide from Abraham now we we are the seed of Opera House I didn't say the children of Abraham [Music] who is that none Isaac the seed Abraham and Sarah had to wait for them how did the seat come on because the Bible says when the when the Three Angels Came today to Abraham uh what happened there they said where is Sarah my wife and he said in the tent and the Bible says I shall return according to the time of life now he never said wish we shall return no I shall return when I returned so when you say because the seeds shall be called in Isaac that's why that scripture where it says Sarah Sarah it was it was with Sarah past the age Isaac came after Sarah has passed you know the scripture okay through faith Sarah also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age amen because she judged him faithful who had promised and the child was delivered when Sarah has passed age all right that's how we so that's how his eye is a king past the age is that right you'll see that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming in the rapture but lucky let us look at that the rapture we look at the Rapture the rapturing faith without death okay now that is after ages God bless you God bless you I can we can read it I don't have foreign [Music] I hope I will see this in this book God bless you Church right I read this part here as he says the lamb took the book within himself [Music] and was the only one who could do it he took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne that's why he says in you there is a throne because God operates from a throne to a throne [Music] then he says upon the throne to claim his Redemption to claim his rights to claim for me and you that he redeemed us back to everything that Adam lost in the Garden of Eden he has redeemed as back to that amen [Music] now with the limbo this is the book in his hands we are ready to ask for his grace mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let us look our past because the curtain of time [Applause] and let us look our past the curtain of time all right now here and here he is a a mediator on the altar just a little until there's there's more has to suffer like you know but this one here okay I read this part here now watch when the last seal is broke and when the seventh angel is giving his message the last trumpet shall sound the dead in Christ shall rest shall rise and which we we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with with them to meet him in the air he claims he claims he has come forth now to claim his possession amen now this is the thing then we read no now watch look at this my bro broke the seals revealed the mystery review them when to the last Church age the only one that's living the rest of them are sleeping I mean this is the last age I've got the book here the Rapture it tells of this last age where we are now is the last age he is the sleeping is the sleeping yeah one they're sleeping Church in their sixth dimensions okay but I think this is what I was trying to read to you he came for his redeemed subjects that means redeemed already he comes here at the last seal he is no more a mediator you know he was a mediator but when the seventh is opened he is no longer no longer immediate why because you are part of him during the time before the seventh seal was opened the seventh he was a mediated standing for you but after the seventh is opened to Human because he is with you you are with him that's why we are that's what we are looking at the free food when you are apart no you are part of him but before he was a mediator when he was still battling for us I I think I'm looking at this I don't know well all right no uh in in closing again here we come oh my oh these wonderful things we've come through that his church is himself amen and the only way today we can be uh today to know him is to get the three forward but finally I picked this one yeah okay page 60 I'm back there in closing Jesus said at that day now we have passed that one but now here we come this one John 14 20 at that day and he says this day which day [Music] this day and then he says when the Revelation is made known you will know that I am in their father and their father in me and I in you through phone Square amen when the Revelation is made known at that day I read you shall know that I'm in I I I'm in the father and you know when he was with the Jews he said I and my father are We Are One that is twofold because the Gentiles had not come here it was not father he said I and my father are one to the Jews he left up the third part I mean because the identures were still to come in all right you see Bible is a mystery I and my father are one I am in their father their father is in you then when the Revelation comes first it's I in you [Music] it makes it a three a three a free food amen amen amen that's what the Lord Jesus says [Music] I'm in the father and it continues to say yes now it makes a three that's why he shall not hide anything from you and I in you in you know brother let I in you be I in you if we are sons and he says I in you really I must say he is in me he is in you because if he says I in you can you today if he opens the seals they run through that three phones foreign but it is open in a three-fold isn't he wonderful okay [Applause] we'll come back we'll come back he is so wonderful amen amen the threefold they're fed the attack it's you in this program you are the third part of the threefold because he is in you amen all right so that's that's just that when he opens the seal it runs through the effect it runs through the three pools they're threefold enough and that day and he says [Music] this day after the seven seal is revealed all right brother pillar Maybe would you love to sing us to sing me that song I don't know [Music] so I'm together with the family here will you be able all right and thank God for that God bless you you are the third part of the threefolds as he says shall I hide from Abraham God won't hide anything from you the Rapture is coming all signs are there Pope the poop there are some people that are saying tribulation already [Music] amen because of what they see it's closing where are we going amen amen things that are happening around the globe it's closing the rapture you can you can even taste it amen that the Rapture is just here I told the church that you know every time driving around working around I I'm looking for the last time and the things that I see I'm saying bye bye I'm looking to the world for the last time yes as I'm walking around I see things but that's for the last time it's closing we have seen that the Rapture is just here you'll know about some other things the Lord bless you my brother amen [Applause] foreign [Music] everybody [Applause] God bless yourself [Applause] if God is with us here evil [Applause] God bless you we salute you know I salute you foreign [Applause] God bless you [Music] really we thank the Lord so much in this message been so much blessing I believe so you are they look like they are common things they are so important that we are looking upon now [Music] study before our eyes something to appreciate good for so much something to be so much thankful about it when you say him to know that you are also part of that you are already connected this is so great amen amen is sometimes you put them things apart and you know you do not include yourself in the plan I mean so you miss seeing a lot but if you consider yourself in the plan that you are there you see the great things [Applause] we are living at the very end time if you consider the word and how things the Wars battles everywhere we are almost there we are almost there we don't know maybe this the last meeting so after that we'll leave and God gives us chances to try hey that this is the greatest opportunity that God has given us we should work on it it should be of a blessing to you don't live like a people that have despaired live like a person who have been visited by visited because you're in the plan of God explains his plan to you yeah I just feel that I am also one of them it will make you to work so hard for you to manifest what God has said with great Reverend we have invited the Believers only the Believers [Music] that's why you can see how God is dealing with us in a very peculiar ways and this is so great to us we should thank God so much [Applause] [Music] and he is the answer to everything in everything of ours amen amen for giving us this message and I believe everyone will go and read the quotations and we will see what is supposedly amen amen so may I say maybe we must
