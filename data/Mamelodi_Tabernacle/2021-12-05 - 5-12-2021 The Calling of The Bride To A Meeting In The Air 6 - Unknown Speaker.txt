brother and sister heal the sick let those daughters back home stand up in the name of jesus this is the third pool ministry a ministry that can create a squirrel this ministry the federal ministry that can bring the deity back again the ministry that will take the church in the rapture we are so thankful lord you are so wonderful bless us before we partake of the word this morning as we pray in jesus christ's name amen glory to jesus shall we turn to our books to give him honor this morning and he has sent us elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the lord did you know the people who can rejoice in the lord to them every word amen [Music] amen that's right sometimes at the end of it for forgive me maybe for doing things that you are not familiar with at the end we we used to say this amen amen is a great word even for somebody to just to say amen to you it's a great way [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] crazy [Music] yay wisdom glory to jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] a young boy he was once a baby messiah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wisdom our name and this messiah when he was born there was the food runner also and the bible says when the mother of this messiah mary worked to greet elizabeth the mother of the foreign [Applause] seeing the messiah coming [Applause] how is it gonna the house of jacob he will visit the jews and when they shall see him they shall say where did where did you get these wings because he'll be now revealed to them and the pride shall meet him in the air oh what a great day amen there is coming a day [Applause] no [Music] foreign [Applause] there will be a great meeting in the air in the sky amen we are being invited amen amen to meet the lord in the earth and then [Applause] okay [Applause] you know description but i would not have you to be concerning them which are asleep that he saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the way of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with them wherefore comfort one another with his uh ways me sometimes when when i'm i'm alone and maybe after praying or like that i find myself raising my hand in trying to touch him but now we are comforted here that the lord himself let us repeat it the lord himself not a prophet this time not a preacher the lord himself now himself is the day when we shall meet him and i think i have read to you one part which we shall follow next time again when that scripture is revelation chapter 21 amen behold i make everything new amen at that day it says the tabernacle of god is with men and i i i look at the prophet and he will be with you it will never be again the lord the father is in heaven but it will be the father with who is with you you will look upon his eyes you can't describe it they're just living there that day it won't be like you are searching for him you are waiting for him he will be a resident so you'll just be together amen and if we ask him about the lord how about the traveling and seeing some other places and the prophet said no don't worry you will travel like a thought [Applause] you can take the whole world but leave me with jesus that's more than enough for me amen oh take your sins please amen says is this the time a question the prophet asked us says is this the time [Music] and let us respond back says is this the time god bless you okay now the rapture emitting in the air in one place he says a meeting in the air in one place he says meeting in the sky both ways attacked by the prophet amen now we are you know you start right there today you can't fly this body cannot take you in a flight but that day will have a meeting in the sky he never he never said anything about the booking for uh jet [Music] that would not be this sky here you know when he died and those who were in the graves they came out the resurrection now he met together with them and a cloud now always it was just a cloud a cloud but by revelation now when the prophet was sent then we realized that that cloud was the souls of those who were in the graves the bible says they came out but they are bodies because they are spirits picked up their bodies and they picked up their bodies imagine some have been their bodies have been in their graves for many many many many many countless years uh one body i know very well is off joseph yeah i know that one and there will be a resurrection [Music] take my bones with you because everything that belongs to me i want to take it with me that day i remember how is it they they saw those men uh with a bag of bones whose bones are this no this is the bones of joseph [Applause] amen amen he has asked us for he says there will be a resurrection [Applause] the body was in the grave the soul was down the atomos the spirit was in with the father now i'm not inviting you to see many people no the father because he said i am going back to my father meaning i am going back to where i was and the prophet says where he was he was light that's why when he met a soul and it was that light he was [Music] somebody cannot see the seventh seal we will look at it because the seventh seal is only for special for some other supernatural species amen amen because it says it finishes the time of all things but we will come to that if god allows now i'm just going to read a few things and we will because we still have to come back to gog and magog battle of armageddon to after this we must put them together we are building a supernatural apollo when all these are put together the river euphrates bethlehem again all these things when put together they make a supernatural apollo then it will take off now today i'll just take a few of this but we are continuing we were also looking at the things before the rapture they have fought already and we try to with this cod tells me that those who fought in heaven [Music] you are going to be surprised but the bride won't be surprised to know that the people that are going to fight the battle of armageddon are the same people who fought him in heaven [Applause] that's why uh they won the battle in heaven they are here to win to continue winning the better [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it won't be a new satan it won't be a new army it won't be a new michael michael it's

now it is the bride of christ [Applause] you know i did a death of for diana was crossing this way that one this way coming from this source coming from that coming from that but then angel doesn't use that king that day it was different from this other bulletins because it was the newspaper what is this you say media media yeah they went to visit the family so they didn't include any person [Music] they only wanted to see their family members now after that they came out with their cameras suffered and then i read it then they said then you're listening to the news they said this news now is from there inside us yes [Music] [Applause] but here is the news from the insiders you know today i won't go to any church unless i hear from the insiders [Applause] if you want me to visit your church with you i can go because i don't hate them but it's another church i can go there and see it amen but if i want now really to worship and to hear the heavenly bullet i would want to meet the insiders [Applause] i said yeah here is the thing now they are coming out with their cameras books and so forth having seen their there inside us now today to hear about the coming of the lord where he is now you should meet the insiders [Applause] concerning the coming of the lord because he is coming to this inside us [Music] if you want to hear truly about his coming you are you must meet the people whom he is coming to so they know whereabouts where you know because he speaks to them amen it is even here in the bible he told us when he will come you can hear from somebody who has just read the news but yet you can't be sure because he's not an insider he has just read forward but find the insiders but this morning for few minutes let me look at this then we'll come to continue the lord willing god bless you god bless you right now i'll take the book of the rapture now um now we find here that enoch was the seventh from nowhere that's the bible which was a type of the church ages all of the rest of the six men before him died but enoch it is the seventh church age that takes the rapture there's no doubt we are in the seventh church age right seventh church age that takes the rapture all of the others died the bible says enoch was amen he was not found one day he will not find us [Applause] god took him until god foreign [Applause] god left elijah so much until he decided to send him uber amen [Applause] you know god can love you so much until he doesn't want to see you in the grave you know he loves this church he loves the bride so much and he said you shall never see death [Applause] that is the last church in egypt they shall go without any death i am going to read you that oh my god you know if only if you are one of these loved by god so much until god has to put aside the real societies and all that say this is my wife this is the bread of christ i don't want her to come through societies and ah man without any death no tears shall be shed for them because they shall just vanish [Applause] i am so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them who shall not be buried [Applause] amen she don't have any policy for her but the only policy is that she will be taken [Applause] loves the husband so much [Applause] his wife so much and said to my wife we shall you shall never taste of death amen i will summon and you just come [Music] was a type of all the rest of them no no let me take it well here now at the end of time the bride will be called out the rupturing without death let me say something here i think you wonder is there a person in the world who is actually not preparing for his death you know people would make sure that there is insurance for this insurance i understand about your car yeah you prepare it for a crush and put it through the insurances and what what and all this because you know that the day is coming but the bride of christ is a person who she is not mindful of death [Music] amen you know some people here some because they know of somebody who was involved in witchcraft and so forth they believe that she will bewitch them because they don't believe that they are the children of god who is the boss [Applause] [Music] when they arrived there he knew that it is impossible for a human being to cross he knows that it is impossible for a man to fly out in a twinkling of an eye he knows what but he said i will be in your now if he is in you you do you don't need to prepare because the flight is already in [Applause] what are you supposed to prepare for because he said that day don't try anything no you shall know that i am in you you look at the an eager everything it's built in and the prophet of god said that the bible says an eagle do not struggle in planning amen and if the enemy comes it doesn't quarrel first it goes high [Applause] when the new world order is coming [Applause] it doesn't quarrel it spreads its wings [Applause] [Applause] we call number two our house so right next to you like this amen because it is an eagle [Applause] it doesn't plan the prophet says it will just watch if when the enemy is coming it will start just spread the wings spread the wings this is the time for the eagles of this day to spread the wings amen amen when the enemy is coming since i'm going to get rid of the church not the eagle [Applause] it will start to spread the wings and in the twinkling of an eye [Applause] when this life is over he never said i will fight i will get our pickies [Applause] what happens every you find this american in this country americans i i type i'm not in politics when trouble comes the first thing they want to know about the safety of their citizens [Music] the first thing they would want to know about their safety if they foresee any danger to their residents they come first for them what about god now the first thing he will think about is amen wife you know for a man a husband to arrive maybe he can try to protect his neighbor being attacked there he becomes foreign why that is his blood what about the about the blood of jesus when his children his wife especially his wife attacked me amen if you want to see the wrath of god you try to attack his children okay i'm closing here he talks about a rapture without death amen that's why we are saying behold i will send you elijah the prophet he will turn the hearts of the children

my way i'm going back home he had a special airport [Applause] no other person could take a flight from that airport so he just walked to the airport and elisha who knew the secret he followed him knowing that he would remain but he thought what the type of manner i will be remaining without the power of elijah amen that's why god took this prophet but there's some people with a supernatural mind when god took the prophet they thought how are we going to do it without if we don't have such power because if you talk about the power some people think about miracles we are talking about the power of god there are men here we arrived at a setting home and then we were told that there is something on the roof and they knew that the data from the neighbors about how big is the sound how what what is that he just climbed up i tell you i'm a witness to that [Music] you know he just started up the roof and he came back with something there without asking questions now this brother to

things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small god made them all right so it humbles a worshiper when he sees the greatness of god it really humbles him that's why they even quit singing because of his greatness because those who have seen him do not sin they fear his greatness are you listening not that he will hurt them he will do something to them but his greatness he is worshipped by such these are the people who fear the god because of his glory his greatness amen amen all right i wonder have you ever seen the cherubim or the angels uh how are you this morning amen where's these guys a pharah season or whatever was the first this day no no no the engines every time they see they go down [Applause] his greatness amen amen and because of his greatness he will he will

of the seventh church age which we are now bearing record of that age he carries on to say oh let's dig in now real deep rapturing being raptured without death we are talking about the people that are just about to be raptured now if the people are planning to kill me let me repeat it i i never never try to plan for my defense anyhow already i believe we are sentenced to death [Music] what we are saying is when i was born i know my parents were trying to prepare for my future and now look how old am i and the very same people who are trying to plan for my future they are normal they were playing they were planning for me but they couldn't plan for themselves you see what is happening in life amen we must put him through this and through this so that yeah but sometimes they say so that when we die he remains with this he remains with that and the same comes back to these ones now these ones who die then these ones will continue they will also call their children yeah we want when we die we want you to take this then they die and those ones come again when we die you see how now that is not life life is christ [Applause] the bible says so he is our life even right now this is some people who would be envied by a success of somebody else all right now in god it is like this god said is it judge john 14. i am going to prepare you a place [Music] but god about us he said i am
