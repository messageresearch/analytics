[59:11] Shalom.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; The brothers will display
[59:18] their prayer request.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I see my elder here.
[59:26] Dr. Mashabi
[59:29] as we ask him to come forth
[59:33] just to say a word of prayer [music]
[59:36] for all the request.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[59:41] &gt;&gt; tidings
[59:43] and offerings.
[59:46] If you have a request in your heart,
[59:51] just raise your hand
[59:54] and the Lord will bless you.
[59:57] As we say, touching Jesus
[1:00:01] all that really matters.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] Touching [music] Jesus
[1:00:17] is all [singing]
[1:00:20] that matters.
[1:00:23] And your [music] life
[1:00:26] and your life [singing]
[1:00:29] will never be [music]
[1:00:33] the same.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; There is only [music]
[1:00:40] there is only [singing]
[1:00:44] one [music] way
[1:00:47] to touch.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Just believe. [singing]
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Just [music]
[1:00:54] believe
[1:00:56] when [singing]
[1:00:57] you call [music]
[1:00:59] on.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] Dear heavenly father, this morning we
[1:01:08] like to thank you for the opportunity
[1:01:12] father to come and gather in this
[1:01:13] fashion to gather in your house this
[1:01:16] morning [music] knowing father that you
[1:01:19] are the one who hold our destiny. That
[1:01:21] is what our prophet says. He says it
[1:01:24] gives us grace consolation to know that
[1:01:26] our destination is not in our hands but
[1:01:29] our destination is in your hands. That
[1:01:32] is why father we know that our life you
[1:01:35] have ordained it. Everything father that
[1:01:37] is happening in our life whether it's
[1:01:39] big challenges [music] whether it be tri
[1:01:42] victories you have ordained it so you
[1:01:45] have predestinated it that way. That is
[1:01:48] why this morning your children see it
[1:01:49] fit to come into their house this
[1:01:52] morning because they know that they
[1:01:53] don't have control over their life. You
[1:01:56] are the one who have control. That is
[1:01:57] why they say if they are sick they can
[1:02:00] come here. They will get healing. If
[1:02:02] they have a need, they can come here.
[1:02:04] You are their Jehovah Gyra. Because
[1:02:06] Father, you've never failed them. Each
[1:02:08] and every time they've gone [music]
[1:02:09] through trials, tribulation, you always
[1:02:12] manage to get them through. Even this
[1:02:14] morning, Father, you're just going to go
[1:02:16] and do the same. Cuz your word teaches
[1:02:18] us that you are the same yesterday,
[1:02:20] today, and forever. You change not. Your
[1:02:23] word changes not. Even your promises
[1:02:25] change not. That is why this morning,
[1:02:27] Father, we say, Father, bless them,
[1:02:29] Father. those who are sick like sister
[1:02:32] Juma has brought his brother who's sick
[1:02:34] father he says here his hand is swollen
[1:02:36] but he knows that you are the great
[1:02:38] physician there's no physician greater
[1:02:40] than you you are not more than a
[1:02:41] physician father you have created man
[1:02:44] that's why you know each and every cell
[1:02:46] each and every molecule in the in his
[1:02:48] body that is why if there's something
[1:02:49] out of place you are the one who can put
[1:02:52] it in place if there's a disease in the
[1:02:55] place disease doesn't know you father it
[1:02:58] doesn't it only surren surreners to your
[1:03:00] power. That is why father we say father
[1:03:02] you give us a power of transformation
[1:03:04] from being sick to being healed. That is
[1:03:07] why this morning they've come father
[1:03:08] saying father you have healed them. That
[1:03:10] is why the word says by your stripes you
[1:03:13] are healed. Not that you are going to be
[1:03:14] healed. We were healed. It's in the
[1:03:17] past. That is why father the only thing
[1:03:18] we can come this morning father is to
[1:03:20] come and accept that healing. If we
[1:03:22] accept it and received it and believe
[1:03:24] it, you will grant it unto us father.
[1:03:27] That is why even this morning father we
[1:03:28] have our brother who wants a revelation
[1:03:30] of our word. What a great thing to be
[1:03:32] have a revelation of your word. It's so
[1:03:35] father please come and reveal yourself
[1:03:37] to him because your word is you. If he
[1:03:40] doesn't see you far he will never get
[1:03:41] your word because father you say father
[1:03:43] you will never leave us alone but you
[1:03:45] leave us with your word with your holy
[1:03:47] spirit to come and guide us. Even this
[1:03:50] morning father he wants guidance. That
[1:03:52] is what he needs. Exactly. Guidance of
[1:03:54] the Holy Spirit. So that when he goes
[1:03:56] through this life, he knows that
[1:03:58] whatever going he's going through, you
[1:03:59] are there with him.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; You are the one leading him. You are the
[1:04:03] one guiding him. That's what he needs.
[1:04:05] And that is what each and every one of
[1:04:07] us in here needs. Father, we come and
[1:04:10] pray and give this commit this service
[1:04:13] unto you. Commit the elders unto you.
[1:04:16] Commit the [music] the saints unto you.
[1:04:18] Even the word that we're going to
[1:04:19] receive it. Father, make us a vessel
[1:04:21] that's going to receive it. Father,
[1:04:22] prepare a ground in us, a fertile ground
[1:04:25] that when your word comes from you,
[1:04:26] Father, we will be able to receive it.
[1:04:28] We pray and believing in the name of our
[1:04:31] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. [music]
[1:04:32] Even Father, saying bless the the
[1:04:34] offering and the tithes, committing
[1:04:36] everything in the name of our Lord and
[1:04:38] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

[1:11:29] my [music] soul.
[1:11:36] You can't kill my body.
[1:11:41] [music and singing]
[1:11:47] my soul. [music]
[1:11:54] [music]
[1:12:00] [music]
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; God bless the children of God this
[1:12:02] morning.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; It's a great blessing to be here and and
[1:12:07] it's a privilege and honor as you know
[1:12:09] that
[1:12:12] I I think I have adjusted to African
[1:12:15] time now.
[1:12:20] taking a long trip
[1:12:23] hours difference takes a little of
[1:12:24] adjustment.
[1:12:29] But I believe that I've adjusted. I've
[1:12:30] had to adjust.
[1:12:33] I've had to adjust also to the fact that
[1:12:36] you drive on the left side of the road
[1:12:41] and you get into a car on the left side,
[1:12:43] not the right side.
[1:12:47] So, I've adjusted to that.
[1:12:51] I uh yesterday I decided to walk over to
[1:12:54] a little shopping plaza
[1:12:59] to buy a couple of things. And so,
[1:13:02] to get there, you have to walk upstairs,
[1:13:05] walk up steps and across and back down
[1:13:07] again.
[1:13:10] So what I did was I went over and I kind
[1:13:12] of held the the rail on the right side
[1:13:15] and I started walking down and somebody
[1:13:18] comes right up to my face.
[1:13:24] You've got to think left-handed. Get you
[1:13:26] know
[1:13:28] I went over to the other side and walked
[1:13:29] down. I knew I was on the right side
[1:13:31] there.
[1:13:32] Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; But uh anyway, that's that's a minor
[1:13:36] adjustment I guess.
[1:13:39] Um, I was listening last week to brother
[1:13:44] Neo preaching his message.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; The plan of God is beyond the plan of
[1:13:50] man.
[1:13:54] Now
[1:13:55] that had some personal significance to
[1:13:57] me, especially
[1:13:59] I just want to tell you that my own
[1:14:02] experience and and what happened to me
[1:14:04] in
[1:14:08] So, as I was listening to service, see,
[1:14:12] I I used to stream in the middle of the
[1:14:14] night.
[1:14:17] I found out that when you get up in the
[1:14:19] middle of the night, you get a little
[1:14:20] bit older, it's hard to stay awake.
[1:14:24] I would be streaming.
[1:14:26] I would be streaming and trying to stay
[1:14:28] awake. And then next thing I was
[1:14:31] so so I realized, you know, if I really
[1:14:34] want to get the essence of what's being
[1:14:36] preached here, I need to be able to
[1:14:39] stream the service and be able to get
[1:14:40] every bit of it at the, you know, at the
[1:14:42] time it's being brought as best I can.
[1:14:44] So I do stream some of those things
[1:14:46] after the fact. But but his his
[1:14:49] particular message was significant to me
[1:14:52] because as I thought about it, there was
[1:14:54] a certain scripture that came to my
[1:14:56] mind.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And uh those things don't happen very
[1:14:59] often for me, but when they do, I really
[1:15:01] pay attention to them. And [music] um I
[1:15:04] wanted to just share that with you
[1:15:05] briefly uh if I could here. Um and
[1:15:10] you'll understand why it was significant
[1:15:11] to me. [music]
[1:15:14] The scripture was taken from James
[1:15:17] chapter 4
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to read these scriptures
[1:15:21] here
[1:15:23] uh verses 13- 15.
[1:15:28] Verse 13 says,
[1:15:30] "Go to now,
[1:15:33] you that say, [music] today or tomorrow,
[1:15:40] we will go into such a city,
[1:15:44] and we will continue there a year and
[1:15:47] buy and sell and get gain."
[1:15:53] That's the plan of man.
[1:15:56] That's the plan of man.
[1:15:58] Okay. Verse 14.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Whereas you know not what shall be on
[1:16:04] the tomorrow.
[1:16:08] For what is your life?
[1:16:12] It is even a vapor that appearth for a
[1:16:14] little time and then vanishes.
[1:16:19] And this is this next scripture is the
[1:16:21] one that stood out to me. You'll
[1:16:24] understand
[1:16:27] for that the fact that your life is just
[1:16:29] like a vapor for that
[1:16:33] say if the Lord will
[1:16:38] live and do this or that. Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; So the will of God prevails
[1:16:45] the circumstances are.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; The will of God prevails.
[1:16:50] Um,
[1:16:51] the will of man, the will of man on my
[1:16:54] trip
[1:16:56] to take a flight
[1:16:59] from from Fort Walton where I live,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; leave in the afternoon at 400 p.m.,
[1:17:05] which would be 1600 hours your time,
[1:17:09] and arrive here [music] the next day
[1:17:13] at 700 p.m.
[1:17:17] That would have been real convenient
[1:17:18] because I would have slept through the
[1:17:20] night on the plane, been somewhat
[1:17:22] rested, and then adjusted a little bit
[1:17:24] more than I had to do.
[1:17:29] But that's not the way it turned out.
[1:17:32] Because what happened was that first
[1:17:34] plane that was supposed to take me to
[1:17:36] Atlanta,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; that plane had a mechanical problem.
[1:17:44] They were not able to repair it without
[1:17:47] having a certain part that was going to
[1:17:48] have to be brought in.
[1:17:51] So what happened was I ended up leaving
[1:17:54] just after midnight,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; getting into Atlanta about 1:30 in the
[1:18:01] morning.
[1:18:04] Then they gave us they put us up in a
[1:18:06] motel or a hotel rather
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; and uh the next day my plans had been
[1:18:13] totally completely changed. The next day
[1:18:16] I ended up going to Amsterdam
[1:18:19] and that that was an eight hour flight
[1:18:21] over
[1:18:23] and we got in Amsterdam at six o'clock
[1:18:25] in the morning
[1:18:28] and then I turned around and caught the
[1:18:31] next plane here at about 10,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; which put me in to the airport at
[1:18:37] Johannesburg at 10:00 p.m. at night.
[1:18:42] So, I got here, but I didn't get here
[1:18:44] glory to the plan of man.
[1:18:47] Uh, but I'm grateful to be here
[1:18:51] just before I went on this trip.
[1:18:54] Some of you who I have met and spoken
[1:18:56] with personally, you know that my
[1:18:58] occupation,
[1:19:00] my occupation is that I'm a plumber.
[1:19:04] So, I work in people's homes.
[1:19:07] And over the past week,
[1:19:10] people have said u I've told people I'm
[1:19:13] going on vacation.
[1:19:16] I'll be gone for a little while. So they
[1:19:18] say, "Oh, where are you going?"
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And uh I said, "I'm going to South
[1:19:22] Africa."
[1:19:24] Oh, you know, people, oh, South Africa,
[1:19:26] you know, safaris and all those.
[1:19:31] And so I told them I said I said I was
[1:19:34] invited
[1:19:36] to South Africa.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I was invited to come and join
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; about 3 months ago in
[1:19:46] October. I took a flight and went up to
[1:19:49] the state of North Carolina because
[1:19:52] I have a family that lives there.
[1:19:55] And uh I spent a week there.
[1:19:59] And as I was getting ready to leave, I
[1:20:01] had my bags packed.
[1:20:05] I was getting ready to go to the airport
[1:20:08] and my phone rings
[1:20:10] and I I thought, "Who is this calling
[1:20:13] me?"
[1:20:14] And I looked and it was a
[1:20:18] video calls
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; from brother Tibogo. [music]
[1:20:23] Oh, he says, "Oh, brother Gabrielson."
[1:20:25] And he takes his phone and goes around
[1:20:28] and here's brother Encadma sitting in
[1:20:31] his chair sitting at his seat with some
[1:20:33] other brothers sitting next to him,
[1:20:35] Brother Edgar and Brother Neil sitting
[1:20:38] there. And he says, "Oh," he says, "Uh,
[1:20:40] I wanted to invite you to come to the
[1:20:42] convention this year."
[1:20:46] And I said, "Oh," I said, "I didn't I
[1:20:48] didn't think I was going to get an
[1:20:49] invitation."
[1:20:52] I said, "I know that with him being in
[1:20:54] and out of the hospital, all the things
[1:20:55] that are going on here,
[1:20:58] they have enough to keep themselves
[1:21:00] occupied without me coming over there
[1:21:01] and being somebody else they have to
[1:21:03] look after." Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; So, but he said, "Oh, no." He said, "I
[1:21:06] can't imagine you not being invited to
[1:21:08] come."
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; I was very honored with that.
[1:21:14] I got my plane ticket immediately.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Weeks, a couple of weeks later, brother
[1:21:20] Encadma went to be with the Lord.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; So, I was a little shocked at that, but
[1:21:25] I and saddened as well.

[1:21:30] [music] to come.

[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I want to warn

[1:28:29] Um, they must not be drunk
[1:28:34] when they get into marriage.
[1:28:39] There must be sober
[1:28:45] because
[1:28:47] if you make a promise
[1:28:51] according to the prophet,
[1:28:56] you have already married.
[1:28:59] Just like
[1:29:01] the Bible says to Joseph,
[1:29:06] Bible says Mary was the wife of Joseph
[1:29:12] but they were not married.
[1:29:17] They have just
[1:29:20] proposed each other.
[1:29:23] So because in future
[1:29:28] when there is a divorce in court
[1:29:34] the pastor who married those couples
[1:29:36] will be called to court.
[1:29:42] Are you listening my brother? They say
[1:29:45] we'll be called to court.
[1:29:49] We'll answer why these two are
[1:29:51] separating.
[1:29:55] Have you cancelled the two?
[1:30:02] What have you told them?
[1:30:05] So I'm telling them now
[1:30:09] they must be sober.
[1:30:13] Uh I'm
[1:30:14] happy
[1:30:17] to call to the fore
[1:30:21] and and sister.

[1:55:56] Matthew 16
[1:56:03] 13- 20
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; verse 13 to 20
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; and Colossians 1 verse 18 only
[1:56:22] Matthews chapter 16 from verse 13 to 20
[1:56:27] When Jesus came into the coast of Cicia,
[1:56:30] Philillip, he asked his disciples,
[1:56:33] saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son
[1:56:36] of man, am?" And they said, "Some say
[1:56:39] that thou are John the Baptist, some
[1:56:42] Elias, and others Jeremiah's or one of
[1:56:45] the prophets." He said unto them, "But
[1:56:48] whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter
[1:56:51] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:56:54] the Son of the living God?" And Jesus
[1:56:57] answered and said unto them unto him,
[1:57:00] "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for
[1:57:03] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:57:05] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:57:08] heaven. And I say also unto thee, that
[1:57:12] thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[1:57:15] will build my church, and the gates of
[1:57:18] hell shall not prevail against it. And I
[1:57:21] will give unto thee the keys of the
[1:57:23] kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou
[1:57:26] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:57:29] heaven. [music] And whatsoever thou
[1:57:31] shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:57:34] heaven. Then charge he his disciples
[1:57:36] that they should tell no man that he was
[1:57:39] Jesus the Christ.
[1:57:42] Colossians chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1
[1:57:57] verse 18.
[1:58:09] Verse 18.
[1:58:13] And he is the head of the body, the
[1:58:15] church, who is the beginning, the
[1:58:18] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:58:21] things he might have the preeminence.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give
[1:58:28] Mike

[1:58:40] thou creator of all heavens
[1:58:43] here this morning father, we have read
[1:58:46] from your holy spir scriptures a word
[1:58:50] that you spoke in the beginning. Father

[1:58:56] today under this great ministry of
[1:59:00] revealing yourself among us through your
[1:59:03] word. Here's our pastor standing before
[1:59:06] us. Father, we pray for that the spirit,
[1:59:09] that road, the word may be able to take
[1:59:12] this word [music] and direct it to each
[1:59:15] and every heart of us so that you may
[1:59:17] manifest yourself in us. We have heard,
[1:59:21] we have read, Lord, that you said you'll
[1:59:23] build your church and the gates of hell
[1:59:26] shall not prevail against it. That
[1:59:29] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:59:31] who you are in these last days.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Father, we commit ourself. We want ask
[1:59:36] you Lord to come and have preminence
[1:59:39] preminence. [music] Come and manifest
[1:59:42] yourself. Come and express yourself. We
[1:59:45] are expecting your vindication Lord
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; that all of us when we live in this
[1:59:50] place we can say surely God has spoken
[1:59:53] with us.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; We ask all these blessings in the
[1:59:56] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:59:58] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[2:00:04] I've heard that my comrade GMA is here.
[2:00:13] I also extend my greetings to him.
[2:00:18] Um I believe the technical team will um
[2:00:24] show the
[2:00:27] uh
[2:00:29] the power of transformation there.
[2:00:33] Wow. Our topic today is
[2:00:37] God building his church is
[2:00:41] is part two. I said I will I'm going to
[2:00:43] come back.
[2:00:48] Where is it?
[2:00:50] He said the same thing. It is about
[2:00:53] having a church here in the last days.
[2:01:00] He is going to have a bride.
[2:01:04] He's able of these stones to children to
[2:01:07] Abraham.
[2:01:11] If we don't follow him,
[2:01:14] he will get somebody else
[2:01:17] that will follow him.
[2:01:20] He is going to a happy eat
[2:01:23] because he has already spoken.
[2:01:28] Whatever he says,
[2:01:32] it has to be that way.
[2:01:35] It cannot change.
[2:01:38] It must come forth the way
[2:01:42] because he said it.
[2:01:46] He's the one who is going to build his
[2:01:50] church.
[2:01:52] He is the one who has built his church.
[2:01:58] He said
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; his church is his body.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; And he said he is the head
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; of his body, the church.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; He is the cornerstone
[2:02:19] and he is also the headstone.
[2:02:23] In other words, this church
[2:02:28] is a church of stones
[2:02:32] because if he is a cornerstone,
[2:02:37] the other stone
[2:02:39] must be the other building material
[2:02:44] must be stones.
[2:02:47] We can just show me something there.
[2:02:53] And God's provided place of worship.
[2:02:58] It says there
[2:03:01] and upon this comes stone
[2:03:08] stone upon
[2:03:11] in each age.
[2:03:15] In other words, because
[2:03:17] he is building this church
[2:03:20] through seven church age.
[2:03:23] In other words, he's building this
[2:03:25] church.
[2:03:26] You see
[2:03:29] that's why it says upon this
[2:03:33] come stone
[2:03:35] in each age
[2:03:39] that the word
[2:03:42] that is coming up just exactly as Jesus
[2:03:46] did in his age
[2:03:50] which is the capstone it all.
[2:03:55] In him laid every age.
[2:04:00] If you can understand that,
[2:04:03] you understand everything.
[2:04:07] He is building himself.
[2:04:11] He is building his body himself.
[2:04:15] If if you look at the church,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; it is himself
[2:04:22] been revealed
[2:04:25] step by step
[2:04:28] until it comes to the last church age.
[2:04:34] When he is building his church,
[2:04:38] he use he he used he built it through
[2:04:42] seven churches.
[2:04:45] using seven
[2:04:48] stars
[2:04:51] which are called seven messengers.
[2:04:56] And those seven messengers,
[2:04:59] they are called seven eyes.
[2:05:07] My brother, can you read Revelation
[2:05:09] chapter 5?
[2:05:13] Then uh my technical team there
[2:05:18] will uh
[2:05:21] flesh another
[2:05:24] quote there
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; which we're going to read
[2:05:30] chapter 5
[2:05:34] then we read verse
[2:05:37] um
[2:05:38] verse Five
[2:05:46] and verse six.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Verse six.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Verse six only.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And I beheld and law in the midst of the
[2:05:53] throne and of the four beasts. And in
[2:05:56] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[2:05:59] it had been slain, having seven horns
[2:06:02] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[2:06:04] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[2:06:07] earth.
[2:06:09] He says
[2:06:11] this lamp
[2:06:14] has got seven
[2:06:16] horns. Seven horns.
[2:06:20] On each horn
[2:06:23] there is an eye.
[2:06:25] And it says
[2:06:27] those eyes
[2:06:29] are seven spirits of God
[2:06:33] sent to all the world.
[2:06:39] You see an eye.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet says if you if they reflect
[2:06:45] the the bridge,
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; the prophet says there,
[2:06:53] an eye,
[2:06:55] there is it. There are seven eyes.
[2:06:59] Eyes means seen.
[2:07:02] See means prophets.
[2:07:05] This lamp had seven horns.
[2:07:10] Each horn
[2:07:12] had an eye.
[2:07:14] Seven eyes. What is it?
[2:07:18] Christ,
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; his bride,
[2:07:22] seven church ages.
[2:07:26] Out of there
[2:07:29] was seven prophets
[2:07:33] that went forth.
[2:07:35] Seven SE
[2:07:37] eyes.
[2:07:39] So the last one
[2:07:42] must also be a seer.
[2:07:46] In other words, when he was building
[2:07:49] this church,
[2:07:51] because he was building himself,
[2:07:55] the Bible says that he he used seven
[2:08:00] eyes
[2:08:02] which are seven messengers
[2:08:06] which are seven spirits
[2:08:09] which are called seven messengers.
[2:08:13] When when we read chapter 4
[2:08:17] We shall come back.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4:5.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Revelation 4:5.
[2:08:27] And out of the throne proceedth
[2:08:29] lightning and thunderings and voices,
[2:08:32] and there were seven lamps of fire
[2:08:35] burning before the the throne, which are
[2:08:38] the seven spirits of God.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; In heaven,
[2:08:43] there are seven spirits.
[2:08:46] When you pass the zodiac,
[2:08:49] then you find stars.
[2:08:52] The same spirits
[2:08:55] in heaven. When you pass the zodiac,
[2:08:59] there are seven stars.
[2:09:02] When you come down here on earth,
[2:09:05] the same seven spirits,
[2:09:08] there are seven star. There are seven
[2:09:10] messengers.
[2:09:12] That's why
[2:09:15] they are called the spirit of God.
[2:09:19] It's not it is not seven spirits.
[2:09:23] It is one spirit of God.
[2:09:25] When it is used seven times
[2:09:29] in seven men
[2:09:32] then we call it seven spirits.
[2:09:35] But it is one spirit of God
[2:09:38] which started to work in the first
[2:09:40] generation.
[2:09:42] through the first messenger
[2:09:44] and to the second church, through the
[2:09:47] second messenger.
[2:09:49] That is the same spirit of God. And
[2:09:52] those those messengers
[2:09:55] they were building his church.
[2:10:00] Those in each age,
[2:10:04] God predestinated a messenger there.
[2:10:09] And under each messenger
[2:10:13] from the first church age, there is a
[2:10:15] messenger. The seven the second church
[2:10:18] age there is a messenger. But in each
[2:10:21] church age and each messenger
[2:10:24] there are pastors there.
[2:10:31] If you can uh flash the seven church
[2:10:34] ages 256
[2:10:36] church ages paragraph 256
[2:10:39] page 256 paragraph 76. Paragraph 76
[2:10:44] until just just to help you
[2:10:48] that under each messenger
[2:10:52] there are pastors
[2:10:54] they are ordained
[2:10:57] to be under
[2:11:00] each messenger
[2:11:02] because they have got the same spirit
[2:11:04] with the messenger.
[2:11:07] They will take from the messenger
[2:11:10] bring to the sheep.
[2:11:12] They will not bring their own thing
[2:11:16] because they are connected
[2:11:19] with the messenger there because the
[2:11:21] messenger is connected
[2:11:24] with God
[2:11:27] because perhaps they don't have it
[2:11:28] there. He was the rock confession
[2:11:35] in each church age.
[2:11:38] Who was the raw confession?
[2:11:41] I said God is building his church.
[2:11:46] He is building his body.
[2:11:48] He is the head of his body.
[2:11:51] He He is He was there in the first
[2:11:54] church age. He was revealing himself
[2:12:00] through seven church ages
[2:12:02] step by step.
[2:12:04] He was the rock confession.
[2:12:08] in each age.
[2:12:10] In each age, he is he was the rock
[2:12:15] and he has to be confessed
[2:12:19] in that in that age. He he had that age
[2:12:24] has to receive the revelation
[2:12:28] who that rock is.
[2:12:31] Amen. And if and that H
[2:12:35] can't miss that
[2:12:38] because that H has got a messenger
[2:12:42] which is connected to the rock
[2:12:46] because he is part of that rock
[2:12:51] then he is bringing that's why the
[2:12:54] prophet says the messengers
[2:12:57] are making Christ known
[2:13:01] to the church in that age a messenger is
[2:13:06] making Christ in other words is
[2:13:09] revealing Christ
[2:13:12] to that age
[2:13:16] those who are from his
[2:13:19] they will recognize him
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; because
[2:13:29] he those messengers are only sent
[2:13:35] to to to introduce him
[2:13:41] because he is the rock
[2:13:45] confession.
[2:13:48] Peter confessed
[2:13:51] that rock
[2:13:53] thou art Christ.
[2:13:55] He was conf he was confessing about that
[2:13:58] rock.
[2:14:00] And in each age
[2:14:03] is the same rock. They must be
[2:14:05] confessed.
[2:14:07] Then you when those who confess that
[2:14:09] rock
[2:14:11] that the Bible says they are blessed.
[2:14:15] [cheering and applause]
[2:14:17] If they can't confess that rock
[2:14:20] then they are not part of it.
[2:14:24] Let me just try to read this because
[2:14:28] in this book of mine here perhaps I will
[2:14:30] find it. It says here
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; that is history.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Now God kept rising up.
[2:14:42] Are you together with me? from the first
[2:14:45] church age,
[2:14:47] God himself rising up because you are
[2:14:53] a little stone.
[2:14:56] You are part of that big stone.
[2:15:00] That's why
[2:15:02] there was a song
[2:15:05] by pastor.
[2:15:07] We used to see we said this seven
[2:15:11] thunder message
[2:15:13] is moving just like a magnet
[2:15:16] is is is moving there and it's moving
[2:15:19] there is moving that like just like a
[2:15:22] magnet because it is just attracting
[2:15:26] it attracting it.
[2:15:30] Then this rock is magnetized
[2:15:34] and then you by predestination
[2:15:38] Because you have got a small stone
[2:15:41] which is placed in you and that stone is
[2:15:45] magnetized to daddy
[2:15:51] is a magnet.
[2:15:54] You are magnetized to your pastor
[2:15:58] and your pastor is magnetized to the
[2:16:01] messenger.
[2:16:03] Amen. Then that is a magnet
[2:16:08] building that stone
[2:16:12] at that age.
[2:16:14] He say what he says. God keep raising up
[2:16:19] not only the messenger
[2:16:22] to each age but he he raised up some
[2:16:26] wonderful helpers
[2:16:30] for those messengers.
[2:16:33] In other words in each age
[2:16:37] hell.
[2:16:43] All right. They will say where does this
[2:16:45] man get this thing from?
[2:16:48] But let me read blasphemous name. I
[2:16:51] think they have there. If they don't
[2:16:53] know
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; blasphemous names they should have
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; um blasphemia's name is page um
[2:17:02] um it's paragraph 119.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Blasphemia's names paragraph one they
[2:17:08] have.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:13] And that has been each h
[2:17:21] has had
[2:17:23] the rock confession
[2:17:27] on up to this rock confession
[2:17:32] of theian churches.
[2:17:36] It has been a rock confession going on.
[2:17:42] until this is
[2:17:45] then it says here
[2:17:47] in paragraph 30 130
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; paragraph 130
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; it says book
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; each one of these age
[2:17:57] had that rock confession
[2:18:01] if if you understand this
[2:18:03] if you understand these things you will
[2:18:06] understand a white rock
[2:18:10] Inside the pyramid pyramid
[2:18:15] each age
[2:18:17] there is a rock confession
[2:18:21] in that age.
[2:18:23] Then it says here
[2:18:25] it can be each one of these ages
[2:18:30] have that raw confession
[2:18:33] and the saints
[2:18:36] are sleeping
[2:18:38] with that raw confession in them
[2:18:41] waiting waiting waiting
[2:18:46] until this age.
[2:18:49] In this age, there is a a a a
[2:18:54] gathering
[2:18:56] of the rocks.
[2:19:01] Those who died
[2:19:04] with the rock confession
[2:19:08] in this age now from west and east.
[2:19:12] They are gathering
[2:19:15] in this headstone.
[2:19:22] Are you are you are you with me there?
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; It says here
[2:19:30] seven. All right. It says
[2:19:33] um seven ages is his booty
[2:19:40] and he is his church.
[2:19:44] And it says his church
[2:19:48] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:19:51] paragraph 252
[2:19:53] revealed
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; is himself
[2:19:56] revealed.
[2:19:59] In other words, in the age you are
[2:20:01] living now,
[2:20:04] if you want to know his church,
[2:20:07] because his church is himself
[2:20:10] revealed.
[2:20:14] He has been revealing. He has been
[2:20:16] revealing himself
[2:20:18] from the first church age
[2:20:22] until now.
[2:20:24] That is the completion.
[2:20:28] It says there his church
[2:20:32] is himself revealed. Amen. Amen.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Did you see it? And expressed by the the
[2:20:40] way he said
[2:20:43] He is God.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; That is the church that he is building.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Isaiah says
[2:20:58] you must remember
[2:21:02] the stone you are healed from.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; You are healed from a stone.
[2:21:09] And when you are healed there, you left
[2:21:12] a space there
[2:21:14] and you go back to a space.
[2:21:19] [applause] That's why they say remember.
[2:21:22] You remember where you come from.
[2:21:25] You feed.
[2:21:27] He is the hidden man.
[2:21:31] I'm talking about the Christ
[2:21:34] who is building his church, who is
[2:21:37] building his his body, who is building
[2:21:40] himself
[2:21:42] in each age. He is the hidden man.
[2:21:47] That's why I said he is the rock of
[2:21:50] fashion.
[2:21:51] He is he is the revelation
[2:21:54] in that age.
[2:21:58] Amen.
[2:21:59] Amen.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; He is the hidden man.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet said
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; after the mana was hidden
[2:22:12] in the hol of holies
[2:22:15] they were accessed by the high priests
[2:22:17] to ones.
[2:22:21] But he said
[2:22:23] after God now in every church age
[2:22:27] the mana is is brought back
[2:22:32] to the church. He said just like when
[2:22:35] Jesus
[2:22:36] was feeding the multitude.
[2:22:40] He took the bread
[2:22:43] and break it and gave it to the
[2:22:45] disciples. And the disciples in gave it
[2:22:49] to the those who are sitting down. He
[2:22:52] said in each age,
[2:22:55] Christ himself
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; takes the mana and gave it to the
[2:22:59] messenger and the messenger takes the
[2:23:03] mana and gave it to us
[2:23:06] because they are hidden.
[2:23:09] Only the messenger is able to go
[2:23:14] and take the hidden man.
[2:23:17] for that generation
[2:23:19] for that age and that generation that
[2:23:23] man
[2:23:25] are are enough
[2:23:28] for that age
[2:23:30] that age cannot say I would have I would
[2:23:33] have lived in
[2:23:35] Paul's age
[2:23:38] the manner for Paul's age
[2:23:41] was enough
[2:23:44] the manner for Paul's age.
[2:23:47] They have got the the the the rapturing
[2:23:51] power in them.
[2:23:54] Those who have received that man
[2:23:58] in age in age in Paul's age they slept
[2:24:01] with the rapture in faith
[2:24:05] because in each age there is a portion
[2:24:13] you can't say I would have lived
[2:24:18] because your age has a portion for you
[2:24:23] he is a hidden
[2:24:26] Because in this age now
[2:24:29] God said to the prophet
[2:24:32] store the food
[2:24:34] because there is coming fine.
[2:24:37] This is the time of femite
[2:24:40] hear what the people are saying.
[2:24:43] See the what the people are trying to
[2:24:44] preach
[2:24:46] because it's femite. They don't know
[2:24:49] what to say but they want to say
[2:24:51] something.
[2:24:53] That's what the Bible says. You will see
[2:24:56] beautifully young men and girls
[2:25:00] going this way and that way looking for
[2:25:03] food
[2:25:05] but not food but food which is the word
[2:25:09] of God.
[2:25:11] Yeah. what the people are saying outside
[2:25:15] because this is the time of famine. You
[2:25:18] see beautiful pictures
[2:25:24] trying to bring something
[2:25:26] but they have nothing to give
[2:25:31] [applause and cheering]
[2:25:34] because this is the time of hidden man.
[2:25:43] In each age they were taking taking
[2:25:48] part.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; But in our age we have we have taken the
[2:25:52] whole
[2:25:57] because nothing should be left.
[2:26:02] We take even the container.
[2:26:14] He is all right.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; The sketch there.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; You see
[2:26:25] those are seven
[2:26:27] church age.
[2:26:32] You see on top there
[2:26:38] is a capstone
[2:26:42] and is a pyramid
[2:26:47] between the seven church ages below
[2:26:51] there
[2:26:53] because from the first church age
[2:26:57] which is Ephesus
[2:26:59] to the last church age which is
[2:27:03] which is the
[2:27:07] We are no more living in
[2:27:11] Amen.
[2:27:13] The prophet says
[2:27:16] we are living in the bride age
[2:27:22] because
[2:27:24] the message
[2:27:26] has taken us
[2:27:29] and place us in another.
[2:27:37] You can you can look at the seat
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; when it cruise
[2:27:43] start from the blade
[2:27:46] and the stock
[2:27:48] and now the shark.
[2:27:51] The time will come when the shock will
[2:27:54] open
[2:27:56] so that the the seat can be in direct
[2:28:00] contact.
[2:28:04] with the sun.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Now it's no more the age of the shark
[2:28:13] has thrived.
[2:28:16] Now it's time for the whole life.
[2:28:21] The leaves,
[2:28:23] the the roots,
[2:28:26] the leaves,
[2:28:28] the stocks are now back into that seat.
[2:28:33] You cannot see them, but they are there.
[2:28:40] Everything
[2:28:41] they are there in the sea. That is the
[2:28:44] age you are living in.
[2:28:47] We are living in the city age.
[2:28:52] And there
[2:28:54] the the prophet says in this book he
[2:28:58] said between
[2:29:00] because from the first church age to the
[2:29:04] church age is the dispensation of the
[2:29:07] son of God.
[2:29:10] And he said between the dispensation of
[2:29:15] the son of God
[2:29:18] because the son of David
[2:29:21] it will be in the millennium. He said
[2:29:24] between there
[2:29:27] in other words between there is where
[2:29:29] there is that headstone
[2:29:35] that is between there and where there is
[2:29:38] that headstone
[2:29:40] where the son of man is revealed
[2:29:45] in other ways the headstone is the
[2:29:48] revelation of the son of man.
[2:29:51] Amen. Because that is where he is
[2:29:55] revealed between the son of God.
[2:29:59] Not during the son of God.
[2:30:04] Amen.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; When somebody says you are in love is
[2:30:10] just laugh at him
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; because
[2:30:20] there in other words he means
[2:30:24] the son of man is not revealed
[2:30:29] because the son of man is revealed above
[2:30:34] of the son of god.
[2:30:37] between the son of God
[2:30:41] and the son of David.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; The son of man is revealed.
[2:30:49] Where is
[2:30:52] where is your
[2:30:58] because the son of man now
[2:31:01] is revealed above.
[2:31:04] That is what the prophet says
[2:31:09] that the son of man is a full seat.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; That is the the dispensation we are
[2:31:20] living in.
[2:31:22] He says we are feeding
[2:31:27] with the body weight
[2:31:30] of the son of
[2:31:33] man.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Which is the hidden man.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; There are seven supernatural angels.
[2:31:54] who came
[2:31:56] and picked the seven our our messenger
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; into their own pyramid.
[2:32:09] Bring it back.
[2:32:12] They bring that our seven angel
[2:32:14] messenger
[2:32:16] into that pyramid.
[2:32:19] That one which is called love
[2:32:22] is the pyramid of the seven supernatural
[2:32:29] and which ke
[2:32:32] it kept the this this physical
[2:32:38] but inside of this one there is a sto
[2:32:46] that one
[2:32:48] is a is the pyramid of the supernatural
[2:32:51] angels
[2:32:54] keeping this one
[2:32:57] because those seven supernatural angels
[2:33:03] wrote the book.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; I do.
[2:33:17] We have seven supernatural angels
[2:33:22] and we have seven physical angels
[2:33:26] which we know Paul and
[2:33:29] these are seven physical angels
[2:33:32] but we have got seven supernatural
[2:33:37] which are the supernatural bodies
[2:33:42] of the seven physical angels.
[2:33:47] Amen.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; And they came
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; and kept this the
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; pyramid.
[2:33:58] [cheering and applause]
[2:34:03] Take it. Amen.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Let me say something. Let me something.
[2:34:13] All
[2:34:14] right.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; In this book shalom.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; In the book shalom.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Just exit like he showed us the seven
[2:34:20] church ages.
[2:34:24] Are you listening?
[2:34:26] Just just exit like he showed us the
[2:34:28] seven church ages.
[2:34:32] What it would come?
[2:34:36] How they would come? Seven church ages.
[2:34:40] And just exactly
[2:34:44] what he showed us, what would come
[2:34:48] when he said that light up there
[2:34:53] in a revelation to it
[2:34:57] to show the world. When he sent the
[2:35:01] seven angels
[2:35:04] to reveal the seven messengers,
[2:35:10] these supernatural angels,
[2:35:13] they came to reveal the seven
[2:35:20] that had been down through there
[2:35:27] and show the loose ends.
[2:35:31] each angel
[2:35:34] coming each day
[2:35:36] and revealing the loose ends
[2:35:41] that Luther left.
[2:35:45] In other words,
[2:35:47] this the supernatural Buddha of Luther
[2:35:52] came and reveal what Luda left.
[2:36:00] Hallelujah.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; All those
[2:36:09] seven supernatural angels
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; together
[2:36:15] they represent Christ.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; All of them together
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; they represented Christ.
[2:36:28] Hallelujah.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Let me read this book here
[2:36:32] all of them.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Not one
[2:36:38] because some will say the notable one
[2:36:44] is Christ which they were wrong.
[2:36:51] If that one is Christ
[2:36:54] the other
[2:37:01] I say we are living in the time of
[2:37:04] hunger.
[2:37:08] They're just picking
[2:37:12] whatever they could find in front of
[2:37:14] them.
[2:37:19] I left here
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; by vision
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; to go to Tusan
[2:37:27] to see what the Lord wanted me to do.
[2:37:32] There he met me
[2:37:35] there at
[2:37:37] he met me up there.
[2:37:45] He went to Tusa.
[2:37:47] The Lord met him
[2:37:49] up there
[2:37:52] as he told you. He
[2:37:55] as as he told you here
[2:37:58] that he would do it in the form of seven
[2:38:01] angels.
[2:38:04] Who made him?
[2:38:06] The Lord.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord. Amen.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; In what form? The
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; form of angels.
[2:38:15] Amen.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; They are the they are they were the ones
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; who kept the pyramid
[2:38:26] in that in that pyramid
[2:38:29] of seven supernatural end.
[2:38:34] I am represented there.
[2:38:36] You are represented.
[2:38:44] When when
[2:38:46] finished
[2:38:48] according to Junior Jackson,
[2:38:51] he opened the the the last part there
[2:38:56] and inside there was a white stone.
[2:39:01] What is that?
[2:39:05] He's scratched himself.
[2:39:08] Hallelujah.
[2:39:12] Because we say in each age
[2:39:15] is a hidden man.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; No one would know who he is.
[2:39:25] If something is hidden
[2:39:29] is hidden by the owner
[2:39:32] and is the owner
[2:39:35] who can reveal it to you.
[2:39:40] That's the reason
[2:39:41] He said, "I went west
[2:39:45] and coming back, I came back with the
[2:39:48] interpretation
[2:39:50] of the white stone
[2:39:54] which is Christ."
[2:39:59] Amen. Amen.
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord meet me there
[2:40:05] in the form of seven angels
[2:40:08] and said,
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; return back
[2:40:14] in the form of seven angels and said to
[2:40:18] me, return back and said,
[2:40:24] and the seven seals was to be open."
[2:40:29] That is just exactly what happened.
[2:40:35] You see sometime brother said I feel
[2:40:39] checked.

[2:40:48] I check by myself.

[2:40:56] But let me just read some quotes
[2:41:02] in this book of it is the rising of the
[2:41:04] sun.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to take a long time
[2:41:13] but let me read it.

[2:42:17] to open the seven.
[2:42:21] What was that? The intelligence.
[2:42:25] Is it the intelligence of man?
[2:42:28] No.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; The quickening power of seeing
[2:42:33] power of God

[2:43:03] Let the well testify.
[2:43:07] This is the truth.

[2:43:35] way,
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; they just see the clouds,
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; but he said take it this way.
[2:43:43] When you look, you see the face of

[2:44:25] opened.
[2:44:28] What was the opening of the seal?
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ.
[2:44:38] Amen.
[2:44:40] People will say if you don't talk about
[2:44:42] sales, we don't know what you're talking
[2:44:45] about because they themselves
[2:44:48] they don't know what the seals are.
[2:44:52] The very seven angels
[2:44:57] which represent the seven churches
[2:45:03] all completed.

[2:52:05] it's so amazing [music]
[2:52:07] to travel so many miles just to come
[2:52:10] here and listen to thy word.
[2:52:13] Not an ordinary person can do [music]
[2:52:15] that.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; This can be done by the beings from
[2:52:19] above.
[2:52:22] May you help him with his family as
[2:52:24] well. May you granting heavenly father
[2:52:27] over his heart desire. He knows very
[2:52:30] well that we love him so much.
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; I know Lord God, he loved our pastor.
[2:52:37] That's why he honored this visitation.
[2:52:41] Oh, we love you so much Lord God.
[2:52:44] You gave us our [music] pastor, precious
[2:52:46] pastor Mua
[2:52:48] to give us a message that is so direct
[2:52:51] to our heart.
[2:52:53] The message heavenly father that is
[2:52:55] breaking all the turbulence and the
[2:52:58] disturbance and everything that is not
[2:53:01] supposed to be here for us to be
[2:53:03] settled.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; Indeed, you are a good God.
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; You knew our heart. You know what is
[2:53:11] worth to us.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; That is why Lord God, you never made a
[2:53:15] mistake.
[2:53:17] When he's preaching, we just see ourself
[2:53:21] moving from place to another place.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; He spoke our heart. May you bless him,
[2:53:28] heavenly father, his family, and all
[2:53:31] those that accompanied him here. Lord,
[2:53:35] this work is the work of the [music]
[2:53:37] Lord. We appreciate you so much.
[2:53:40] Heavenly Father, bless the entire church
[2:53:44] for our being here is not in vain. You
[2:53:48] prepared our heart. You knew the number
[2:53:51] of the people that will be attending
[2:53:53] this morning. You knew the number that
[2:53:56] will be streaming this morning. You even
[2:53:59] know the number of our hairs. Nothing
[2:54:02] and nothing can be hid before thee. Lord
[2:54:04] God, we love you so much. We appreciate
[2:54:08] you so much. Since when we started from
[2:54:11] the beginning of this service, we just
[2:54:14] saw the work of the Lord. We just saw
[2:54:17] you God doing everything unto us that
[2:54:20] you were supposed to do this morning. We
[2:54:23] appreciate the way you have ministered
[2:54:25] unto our heart. As we will be going to
[2:54:28] the second session of the baptism, Lord
[2:54:30] God, I have realized that it's no longer
[2:54:34] our effort to see people coming to
[2:54:36] baptize.
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; It's you, God, calling them. It shows,
[2:54:40] heavenly father, something is about to
[2:54:43] happen soon and very soon. We'll be
[2:54:46] going back to glory with a rapture. We
[2:54:50] love you so much.
[2:54:53] Bless each and every individual this
[2:54:55] afternoon. Lord God, you will give us
[2:54:57] the traveling message as we'll be going
[2:54:59] back to our homes. We thank you, Lord,
[2:55:02] for sustaining us throughout the entire
[2:55:05] 2025.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; And this message, heavenly father, will
[2:55:09] usher us into 2026 if there is one.
[2:55:13] [applause]
[2:55:14] For we know, Lord God, that there's no
[2:55:17] longer time for us to be in this world.
[2:55:20] Soon we'll be gone. Bless each and every
[2:55:23] individual. [music]
[2:55:24] Thank you Lord for everything that that
[2:55:26] you have done unto us this year. Those
[2:55:29] that has failed this year, but you'll
[2:55:31] give them the the breakthrough the
[2:55:33] following year. Heavenly Father, when
[2:55:35] brother Brandham preached and prayed the
[2:55:38] other day, he said, "Lord God, [music]
[2:55:41] bless this church and give them the
[2:55:43] heart of their desire
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; financially,
[2:55:48] physically,
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; spiritually
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; and everything that they need
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; should be granted to them. [music]
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; It's my prayer Lord God."
[2:55:59] Others were looking for jobs. Others
[2:56:02] were looking for healing. Others were
[2:56:04] looking for this great time. Grant each
[2:56:08] and everyone of Lord the heart of the
[2:56:12] desire as our pastor will say as long as
[2:56:16] is aligned [music] with the word of God.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; We love you so much and we put
[2:56:21] everything Lord God [music] unto your
[2:56:23] keepable hand in the mighty name of our
[2:56:26] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

[3:10:00] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard

[3:10:05] and said unto Peter, and to the rest of
[3:10:08] the apostles, men and brethren, what
[3:10:11] shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,
[3:10:14] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:10:17] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:10:19] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:10:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:10:24] the promise is unto you and your
[3:10:26] children, and to all that are a far off,
