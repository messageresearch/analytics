[28:32] grace
[28:35] uh
[28:37] I'm going to read some things foreign
[28:42] [Music]
[28:44] but I'm going to take

[31:13] because it is not your fault
[31:18] it is just something that happened
[31:21] the whole night without lies that's
[31:25] number one I mean but we thank God that
[31:29] they fixed they think this morning
[31:33] and they told us what actually happened
[31:37] all right let's look at this
[31:41] I'm reading from this book
[31:46] of the trumpets
[31:48] and
[31:50] page 15.
[31:53] okay
[32:01] Abraham Abraham

[32:12] a promised Sun Moon
[32:15] Isaac healing Isaac
[32:18] right amen
[32:20] you know we as the children of God
[32:23] if we come to the city
[32:26] we come for the promised word amen
[32:34] we don't just take things at random
[32:39] it should be something amen that God has
[32:42] promised
[32:47] you know if you take seed
[32:51] everything
[32:54] is in that thing is
[33:01] life for pillow the life of the Creator
[33:06] it's in that City
[33:12] amen amen
[33:14] now if planted is Rich it brings forth
[33:19] actually
[33:21] the promises
[33:23] that were planted in Italian
[33:31] believe in the word of God
[33:35] it's not from your mind
[33:39] because
[33:41] you are a seed obey now God has planted
[33:46] in that City
[33:51] the law of growth
[33:55] amen amen
[33:58] and we are told that
[34:00] when the seed is planted
[34:05] it is
[34:08] a
[34:10] soil
[34:13] foreign
[34:21] [Music]
[34:52] all right amen you know now like you are
[34:56] like in the field
[35:01] okay I mean
[35:03] now let me read to you this
[35:07] Abraham and Sarah were looking for a
[35:12] coming son a promised son
[35:21] earlier
[35:38] that's why I'm saying here this is the
[35:42] end of the journey
[35:47] God had appeared in many forms
[35:55] like even to us
[35:57] he appeared in many forms
[36:03] but we are now left with one foreign
[36:12] then he spoke to Abraham
[36:16] Abraham and by Voices
[36:21] just before the coming Sun arrives
[36:24] either
[36:30] now we've been through it
[36:34] I'm just rehearsing
[36:37] to get this to you
[36:41] that he might change the body of Abrams
[36:49] that he changed
[36:51] the body of Abraham immediately
[37:11] [Applause]
[37:18] he changed
[37:20] their bodies
[37:23] notice the last sign that they got yeah
[37:29] before the sun arrived
[37:33] was Jehovah talking to them
[37:38] in the form of a man
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:50] in the form of a man
[37:56] and how they
[37:58] knew this was
[38:01] Jehovah
[38:04] because he said
[38:13] just a few days before
[38:16] God has changed his name
[38:29] okay
[38:31] now we'll start here
[38:34] that's how
[38:36] that's why I say
[38:38] the end of the journey
[38:47] and
[38:48] let's start
[38:51] now
[38:53] since the opening
[38:58] who is this is

[1:02:40] I shall put it alone
[1:02:46] anyway
[1:02:48] but when the law was written on the
[1:02:51] stone
[1:02:53] they couldn't keep it
[1:02:55] they couldn't read about it
[1:03:04] until he came
[1:03:06] and said now I'm going to put the laws
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] if the law of God is in you

[1:03:38] but if it is
[1:03:42] you will still continue
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:54] that's why he said
[1:03:55] I shall put the Lord
[1:04:01] foreign
[1:04:34] foreign
[1:04:37] people can preach to themselves
[1:04:44] God knows

[1:04:58] you know it says getting where he is
[1:05:06] he revealed himself
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:19] I was looking at something here
[1:05:23] hey let me look at it yeah
[1:05:28] time allows me to look at this
[1:05:33] uh that's this part here
[1:05:39] when John has your hand met this
[1:05:43] Angelina
[1:05:46] and
[1:05:47] that is you know in the Book of
[1:05:49] Revelation
[1:05:53] the angel that said
[1:05:59] for I am
[1:06:02] for I am of thy fellow
[1:06:05] servants
[1:06:12] that's Revelation 20.
[1:06:17] right I mean
[1:06:20] can you read it for us I just want to
[1:06:22] say something here
[1:06:26] Revelation chapter 22 from verse
[1:06:30] 7.
[1:06:32] behold I come quickly blessed you see
[1:06:35] that keepeth the saying of the prophecy
[1:06:37] of this book
[1:06:39] and I John saw these things in heaven
[1:06:42] and when I had head and sin I fell down
[1:06:45] to worship before the feet of the Angel
[1:06:48] which showed me these things then said
[1:06:51] he unto me see thou do it not for I am
[1:06:54] thy fellow servant amen and of thy
[1:06:56] Brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:06:59] keep the saying of this book worship God
[1:07:03] amen amen he identified himself
[1:07:08] I am off
[1:07:11] thy fellow seven
[1:07:15] of their prophets
[1:07:17] now listen to them
[1:07:20] to my prophets
[1:07:22] it might have been Elijah
[1:07:29] it might have been it's one of the
[1:07:33] prophets
[1:07:39] now when he said it might have been
[1:07:44] Elijah
[1:07:46] I said amen amen
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:55] and
[1:07:56] look at the nature of that
[1:08:01] when look at the nature of this
[1:08:06] John was a writer well Johan is
[1:08:11] but this is the spirit of a prophet
[1:08:21] now in the house of Abraham there was
[1:08:25] this
[1:08:26] prophet
[1:08:30] he was the main prophet
[1:08:37] who went to and found
[1:08:40] a wife for Isaac is
[1:08:49] because he knew the nature of Abraham
[1:08:55] and he knew how to serve Abraham
[1:09:01] the god of Abraham
[1:09:04] you know since we have the nature of God
[1:09:10] the god whom he is
[1:09:30] thank you
[1:09:32] amen amen amen Abraham
[1:09:37] choose that one
[1:09:40] okay amen now I read
[1:09:44] when he said
[1:09:47] and
[1:09:49] for I am of thy fellow servants
[1:09:57] of the prophets
[1:10:00] then I look at it here then it says here
[1:10:05] it might
[1:10:07] Incarnation for it might have been
[1:10:11] Elijah is
[1:10:15] I'll tell you that I said amen amen
[1:10:22] okay
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:24] because
[1:10:31] make these things
[1:10:34] here it says and this is
[1:10:40] became flesh
[1:10:44] he revealed himself as a son of man
[1:10:50] when he come as a prophet Australia
[1:10:59] getting where he is
[1:11:05] he come in three names
[1:11:14] the Son of God the son of David
[1:11:18] who came in three names
[1:11:24] you see
[1:11:28] why you know
[1:11:33] I asked a question who came in this
[1:11:36] foreign
[1:11:46] no comment no comment right
[1:11:52] now it says getting where he is
[1:12:03] when they came to Jesus
[1:12:13] is that right
[1:12:16] okay amen and Peter said
[1:12:20] where shall we go
[1:12:23] we have arrived rapidly
[1:12:27] I mean
[1:12:29] there's no other place for us
[1:12:38] and was waiting for that way to be made
[1:12:46] now that's why the prophet says this
[1:12:50] she was
[1:12:53] part of the attack
[1:12:58] something
[1:13:00] brought her to Jesus
[1:13:05] but it's something that God has put in
[1:13:08] that woman
[1:13:17] if I don't want to come to church I can
[1:13:20] sit back home
[1:13:24] but there is something a big will
[1:13:31] even if sometimes I I'm sick
[1:13:47] Satan doesn't
[1:13:49] I mean he's so jealous
[1:13:55] he doesn't want us to worship
[1:14:00] he was kicked out of heaven is
[1:14:09] for to stop the people
[1:14:12] from worshiping God
[1:14:14] Amen because he is
[1:14:22] foreign
[1:14:42] but once he arrives here
[1:14:52] then
[1:14:53] oh he sleeps
[1:15:01] I'll tell you what will talk about it
[1:15:06] why somebody will come here
[1:15:11] only to dose of network
[1:15:21] right
[1:15:24] I haven't seen a crook like a devil
[1:15:30] now there's something
[1:15:32] you didn't hear it
[1:15:36] became flesh
[1:15:42] he received
[1:15:45] himself as a son revealed himself as a
[1:15:49] song of men
[1:15:53] son of man is
[1:16:00] that means he came as

[1:16:11] Supernatural
[1:16:13] s

[1:16:36] the angel said for I am off
[1:16:39] worry
[1:16:45] and of the prophets
[1:16:49] it might have been Elijah

[1:58:58] a man you are a God who stays in a man
[1:59:27] no matter what the devil can say no
[1:59:30] matter what the devil can lie no matter
