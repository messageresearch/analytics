[38:29] How are you?
[38:33] [Music]
[38:43] [Music]
[38:49] [Applause]
[39:02] Yes,
[39:06] [Music]
[39:08] [Applause]
[39:10] I'm Yes,
[39:16] I'm way.
[39:23] I greet all people inside
[39:28] here in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:33] Christ. You will forgive us to come
[39:39] late. It's just because where we were
[39:42] there were some problems.
[39:46] But uh thank God we have
[39:50] come. We'll now be too long because time
[39:54] has
[39:56] gone. We just touch here and
[40:00] there so that we can not waste time for
[40:09] um God is God
[40:12] of grace.
[40:16] Scott of comfort,
[40:20] Scott of peace.
[40:25] He's not the creator of
[40:29] death. Death comes from
[40:35] Satan. But God has known about it.
[40:40] But because Satan always want to make us
[40:47] unhappy, God will always make a
[40:51] way. So that when Satan tries to disturb
[40:57] us, God took us out of that
[41:02] disturbance. The Bible says when Satan
[41:06] comes like a
[41:09] flood, God will set a standard
[41:13] against. He said, "Many are the
[41:16] affliction of the
[41:20] Russians." But God took them out of them
[41:26] all. We expect God to be with
[41:30] us in this family.
[41:34] He has got a
[41:36] reason of the thing which has happened
[41:40] here. The purpose of
[41:43] God will never be
[41:46] defeated. Satan will try by our
[41:49] means. But we will never defeat the
[41:52] purpose of
[41:55] God. From the
[41:57] beginning we knew Satan
[42:01] tried in Babylon
[42:03] there he tried to persecute
[42:10] Shadrach. But at the
[42:13] end people knew
[42:15] that God is got over
[42:20] fire when Shadrach and Mach were in the
[42:23] fire.
[42:26] Satan and his demons were
[42:29] hating, but God got inside the
[42:33] fire. It was better in the fire than
[42:36] outside the
[42:39] fire. It will be better in this
[42:42] situation than before.
[42:47] Let's open the book of Thessalonians.
[42:53] Chapter 4.
[42:56] Uh, chapter 12. Chapter 4. Uh, chapter
[43:00] 4.
[43:02] Um, first Thessalonians. Yeah. Yeah.
[43:06] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. First Yeah. First
[43:08] Thessalonians chapter 4.
[43:15] We start from verse
[43:24] 13 from to verse 17.
[43:29] Verse 17.
[43:36] But I would not have you to be ignorant,
[43:39] brethren, concerning them which are
[43:42] asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
[43:45] others which have no hope. For if we
[43:48] believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[43:52] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[43:54] will God bring with him. For this we say
[43:58] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[44:01] we which are alive and remain unto the
[44:04] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[44:07] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[44:09] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[44:12] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[44:16] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[44:18] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[44:21] which are alive and remain shall be
[44:24] caught up together with them in the
[44:26] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[44:29] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[44:32] Then we read again uh Hebrews chapter
[44:35] 11.
[44:41] We start from verse
[44:45] 37 verse 37 to verse 40.
[44:53] from verse 85. From verse
[44:56] 35, women received their dead raised to
[45:00] life again. Just just read verse 85
[45:04] only. Women received their dead raised
[45:08] to life again. And others were tortured
[45:11] not accepting deliverance that they
[45:14] might obtain a better resurrection. All
[45:17] right. Let's close our eyes as
[45:23] we
[45:25] mighty
[45:26] God, the God who
[45:29] created all
[45:31] things. This is the
[45:34] day which you have known before the
[45:37] foundation of the
[45:39] world. We are
[45:41] here. We are
[45:44] people. that you are the supreme
[45:48] power that can come and took over. Use
[45:52] our voice to comfort each and everyone
[45:56] who is here. We are asking this in the
[45:59] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[46:01] Jesus Christ.
[46:03] Amen. Thank you those who have ceased
[46:06] they may take their seats.
[46:12] I am going to talk
[46:15] about the hope
[46:18] of the
[46:26] saints. We being
[46:29] [Music]
[46:32] believers, we believe ourselves to be
[46:35] saints.
[46:40] And we associate ourself with the saints
[46:44] of the Old
[46:50] Testament. We have
[46:53] hope. When we are living here on
[46:57] earth, we have hope of the future.
[47:03] We have
[47:05] hope that when this earthly tabernacle
[47:08] we are dwelling
[47:12] in be
[47:14] dissolved, we have got another
[47:18] house. This one is a temporary dwelling
[47:25] place. But we have
[47:27] hope. We have great
[47:30] hope and it is the hope of all
[47:34] saints. When they are living here, they
[47:38] have got hope that this temporary
[47:41] habitation of
[47:45] ours when it
[47:47] dissolves. We have got another
[47:52] house which is
[47:55] eternal which is the house of
[47:59] comfort which is the house of
[48:02] peace which is the eternal
[48:05] house. That is our
[48:08] comfort and we have got a
[48:11] comfort that time will
[48:14] come after death. We have got another
[48:18] house. But we
[48:20] know we don't end
[48:23] there. If we if we if it happens that we
[48:28] don't
[48:28] die those who have gone before
[48:31] us we have got hope that we are going to
[48:35] meet together with
[48:37] them. According this scripture here, the
[48:41] Bible says here, Jesus
[48:44] himself will descend from
[48:48] heaven with a shout. The Bible says so.
[48:53] And that is what we
[48:55] believe. When he descend from
[48:58] heaven, he will descend with a
[49:01] shout, with a voice, and with a trumpet.
[49:06] Are we together with him? I say we have
[49:10] hope. When we live here, we have hope
[49:15] that when this tabernacle
[49:17] dissolve, we have got another
[49:20] house which is
[49:22] eternal. But if it
[49:25] happens this we don't this tabernacle
[49:28] don't
[49:30] dissolve those who tanle has
[49:34] dissolved just like my sister
[49:37] here. We believe and we have got hope
[49:42] that we are going to be with
[49:44] them. The Bible says come as the Bible
[49:49] is saying here. He will descend with a
[49:53] shout and with a voice with a
[49:58] trumpet
[50:00] descending to take us to our
[50:03] destination.
[50:05] My sister is in a place of waiting. And
[50:11] that place of waiting is a house that he
[50:16] my sister is waiting in
[50:18] it waiting for another
[50:22] house which is we call it a glorified
[50:26] house. This one, this one here is an
[50:31] earthly house.
[50:33] This one here is a motor house. This one
[50:37] here is a natural house. But we have got
[50:41] another
[50:42] house which is called a
[50:45] theophony. When I move out of this one,
[50:49] I go to that one which is a
[50:52] theophony. It's only for the
[50:56] saints. Those who are not the
[50:59] saints, they don't have that house.
[51:02] That's why I believe that my sister here
[51:06] because he
[51:08] believe in in having that
[51:11] house he he he she has went to that
[51:15] house. Are you are you together with us?
[51:18] She she is already in that
[51:21] house and she she will
[51:24] never allow anybody to call her
[51:29] back to come to this one because this
[51:33] one is is is is a past
[51:39] house. In this
[51:42] house we suffer.
[51:45] In this house we we don't have
[51:48] peace but in that house we have got
[51:52] peace but we are going to
[51:55] wait in that house because according to
[52:00] the Bible when Jesus
[52:06] descending to put us in another
[52:10] house and that house is called a
[52:13] glorified
[52:17] When he descend, the Bible says he
[52:21] descend with a
[52:24] shout and a shout is a
[52:28] message.
[52:30] Together he sings
[52:33] together. If there if there is a
[52:36] message, there must be a
[52:39] messenger because we can't have a
[52:41] message without a
[52:44] messenger. And if there is a
[52:46] messenger, a messenger is sent by
[52:51] somebody and if is sent by somebody, he
[52:54] is getting a message from
[52:57] somebody and to deliver that message to
[53:01] somebody. Are you together with us? Then
[53:05] here we have got the
[53:07] messenger which is the seventh angel
[53:10] messenger who was
[53:13] sent
[53:14] together the bride together in this last
[53:20] age. This message is gathering the
[53:26] living. Amen. We that are living. This
[53:30] message is gathering us
[53:33] together. This
[53:35] shout. Amen. Amen. So that we can when
[53:38] we are together then the voice will
[53:41] come.
[53:43] The voice the the the shout is a
[53:48] message gathering
[53:50] us who are
[53:52] leaving to come together. Then the voice
[53:56] will
[53:57] come to get those who are
[54:01] asleep to call them back so that they
[54:05] can come out be
[54:08] resurrected. When they are out and
[54:12] resurrected, they will come and gather
[54:16] together with those who are living.
[54:20] The the message is gathering those who
[54:24] are
[54:25] living. They come from different
[54:28] denominations. They come from different
[54:31] places. They come at a certain
[54:34] place. Because if they are
[54:37] gathered, they must be gathered at a
[54:39] certain
[54:41] place. And the Bible says where the cass
[54:45] is the eagles will be gathered.
[54:50] And the the children of God, the saints,
[54:54] the bride are likened to unto the
[54:57] eagle. And when the when the cus
[55:01] is, the eagles will gather. And the cas
[55:05] is the word of God. And when the word of
[55:09] God
[55:10] is the shout, which is the
[55:14] message, the eagles will gather.
[55:18] Are you together with us? There must be
[55:21] the
[55:22] word. The wait for that
[55:26] season is not the word for each
[55:31] season. It's the weight for your
[55:35] season because God has allotted his
[55:41] weight for each season.
[55:44] in our
[55:46] season. There is the word for this
[55:50] season. This word is preparing the
[55:55] bride. When they when they eat this
[55:59] weight, it prepares them to take a
[56:03] flight. It prepares them to change this
[56:08] body. Without taking this this
[56:11] way, which is called the
[56:14] shout, you will never
[56:17] change. It is to call the the the
[56:21] brethren
[56:23] together and to prepare them for the
[56:27] flight. As we are the seed of
[56:31] Abraham, we must just be like
[56:35] Abraham. We must receive before we
[56:38] receive our promised
[56:41] son. Because our promised
[56:44] son is the rapture which we are reading
[56:48] about it
[56:49] here. When he is
[56:52] descending, he descending to rapture
[56:55] us. And the rapture is our
[57:00] hope. Amen. Amen. Is our promised son.
[57:04] Our promised son is the
[57:07] rapture. Abraham's promised
[57:10] son. It was
[57:12] Isaac. Our promised son is the rapture.
[57:16] As the seed of
[57:18] Abraham, we have got a promise. And that
[57:22] promise is the
[57:24] rapture. Before Abraham can receive his
[57:29] promis, he received the the last
[57:33] message from a
[57:35] messenger. And that messenger who came
[57:39] to
[57:39] Abraham was God
[57:42] himself. But it was God in flesh
[57:46] bringing the message to Abraham. We have
[57:50] got a messenger which was God himself.
[57:55] who came in our time
[57:58] represented in
[58:01] flesh. It was a flesh of man but in that
[58:05] flesh of man there was God. Are you
[58:09] together with us? Just like when he was
[58:12] with Abraham there, the difference is
[58:15] just this one was born by a woman, but
[58:20] that one God created the body
[58:24] himself, but it was the body just like
[58:27] this body. The difference is that that
[58:31] one was not born by
[58:33] woman, but it was a body like my body
[58:37] because Abraham made food for him.
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:41] He ate food which he was given by
[58:44] Abraham and in my age and your
[58:47] age. God came represented in
[58:52] flesh. He wore he wore a food a suit
[58:55] like
[58:56] me. It was God in man. That man was not
[59:01] God. But God was represented in that
[59:05] man.
[59:07] God in that man he he was the one who
[59:12] was delivering the message because the
[59:15] Bible said Christ himself sended from
[59:18] heaven with a
[59:22] shout that shout that is the voice like
[59:27] the one who was with Abraham when God
[59:30] was in Abraham's
[59:33] house there was other
[59:35] angels two angels
[59:37] who went to
[59:38] Sodom. They they make miracles there in
[59:43] Sodom. But with Abraham there was no
[59:46] miracle there. God just told
[59:50] Abraham, I am
[59:53] coming. Your
[59:55] wife will have a
[59:57] son. Amen. Amen. That is the message
[1:00:01] given to Abraham. After that message,
[1:00:05] Sarah was at the
[1:00:07] back. This message which was spoken to
[1:00:12] Abraham was direct to the
[1:00:16] backside and the backside there. There
[1:00:19] was Sarah there. Sah was the
[1:00:23] backside. The bride was the backside.
[1:00:27] The man who was in flesh coming here, he
[1:00:31] was talking here. But the the message
[1:00:35] was directed to the backside. And the
[1:00:38] backside was the bride there. The bride
[1:00:42] is the backside. The message was
[1:00:44] directed to
[1:00:46] them. The bride was the mystery.
[1:00:54] Sah overhead.
[1:00:58] but the message was not spoken to
[1:01:02] her. God was speaking with
[1:01:05] Abraham but s over
[1:01:08] her because they were talking about
[1:01:12] her. He he said how can that
[1:01:15] happen? These two men what are they
[1:01:18] talking about? They said me can can be
[1:01:23] pregnant.
[1:01:24] He was he was
[1:01:26] whispering in
[1:01:28] herself because the man who was with
[1:01:32] Abraham was God. He he he could he could
[1:01:36] discern what was in the heart of
[1:01:40] Sarah. What was Sarah thinking in
[1:01:43] herself? He said to Abraham, "What did
[1:01:47] Sarah say?
[1:01:50] Why did he say why did she say how shall
[1:01:54] this happen to
[1:01:58] me? Because the man who was with
[1:02:02] Abraham was God
[1:02:05] himself in Sodom.
[1:02:08] there representing other
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:13] churches. There were two messengers
[1:02:17] there just making
[1:02:20] miracles taking Lot
[1:02:24] there before the the before the the
[1:02:28] fire.
[1:02:31] Lord's
[1:02:32] wife was taken
[1:02:35] out, but he was not completely taken
[1:02:39] out. He just got out for a
[1:02:43] little stop on the way because her heart
[1:02:48] was still in the
[1:02:50] world. The heart was still in
[1:02:53] Sodom. Because in Sodom, he was perhaps
[1:02:58] the present of human.
[1:03:03] Isaiah
[1:03:04] reps. I don't say he she was Isaiah
[1:03:09] reps. She was the
[1:03:11] president of the woman's
[1:03:14] league. He was she was praised there.
[1:03:17] She was given a position. But these
[1:03:20] people they say this city is going to
[1:03:23] burn while I'm enjoying here. What? How
[1:03:27] can this city
[1:03:30] be? What is the back? Let me look
[1:03:36] back her 10. Her
[1:03:39] turn. Her
[1:03:42] turn. Make her to turn to the pillar
[1:03:49] of don't look back.
[1:03:54] But we know if you are part of the
[1:03:59] bride, if you are part of Abraham's
[1:04:03] seed, you will never look back because
[1:04:07] first of all, you are not there in
[1:04:12] sodom. You see in in our
[1:04:17] flesh, we are living with people.
[1:04:20] Amen. We we move where people
[1:04:24] move. We see what people are
[1:04:28] doing. But inside
[1:04:31] us, we we we are different with
[1:04:35] them. Our our
[1:04:37] side is not their
[1:04:40] side. How we take those things is not
[1:04:44] the way they take them.
[1:04:47] How they think is not how we think
[1:04:51] because what happened to
[1:04:53] us is not what happened to
[1:04:57] them. Are you together with me? Then
[1:05:00] after
[1:05:01] Abraham, after the message has been
[1:05:06] delivered, something
[1:05:08] happened
[1:05:10] inside the body of
[1:05:14] Sarah. Amen.
[1:05:17] change
[1:05:19] happened in the body of
[1:05:21] Z. There was two
[1:05:25] changes because Sarah was
[1:05:31] barren. His
[1:05:34] insight the system which must which must
[1:05:38] bring
[1:05:40] birth it had to be
[1:05:43] changed. The baronness
[1:05:47] must be taken
[1:05:48] out. When the burnness is taken out and
[1:05:52] her body must change back to be young
[1:05:58] woman
[1:06:00] again. The baronness must be taken out.
[1:06:04] That is the thing that the
[1:06:06] baroness it must be taken out. That is
[1:06:09] the first thing must be taken. And after
[1:06:12] the bage is taken up, then the body must
[1:06:15] change.
[1:06:20] We must receive the
[1:06:25] word. The
[1:06:27] gathering is to be gathered where the
[1:06:31] word
[1:06:32] is. We must be
[1:06:34] fed by the weight which brings
[1:06:39] life. And this the way which we are fed
[1:06:44] on it it is like cells
[1:06:49] because before an organ can be
[1:06:54] formed. There must come cells. It must
[1:06:57] be
[1:06:57] cells. It must be cell upon
[1:07:00] cell upon cell until they form an
[1:07:04] organ. Organ they form an organism.
[1:07:08] This weight it must be weight upon
[1:07:12] weight. That's why Isaiah says it must
[1:07:16] be precept upon precept.
[1:07:21] This
[1:07:22] message is not something that is
[1:07:27] stagnant. It must it must be weight upon
[1:07:31] weight. And if those words are coming,
[1:07:34] if you receive those words in
[1:07:37] you because you have got a spiritual
[1:07:41] womb, then in your spiritual womb. When
[1:07:45] you receive that
[1:07:46] word is building
[1:07:49] something inside
[1:07:52] you. The change started inside
[1:07:56] you. the your your
[1:07:59] barrenness is taken out by the
[1:08:02] way that you
[1:08:04] receive. Then you when you are burn when
[1:08:06] the barness is taken
[1:08:09] out then this body is going to be
[1:08:13] changed so that you take another
[1:08:16] body which is the glorified body. But
[1:08:19] the
[1:08:20] baroness must be taken out first. That
[1:08:23] is the first change and that change it
[1:08:27] must be brought by the
[1:08:29] weight the weight which I'm preaching
[1:08:32] here it must bring that must take out
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:36] barness the way that the way that the
[1:08:39] messenger has
[1:08:41] brought that is the way that I'm
[1:08:43] preaching here and this way that I'm
[1:08:46] preaching here must take out barness
[1:08:50] out so that you
[1:08:53] must so that this
[1:08:55] body can be changed. The way that you
[1:08:59] receive is building another body inside
[1:09:03] you or is or is attracting that
[1:09:08] body that must be in
[1:09:11] you because it's the body you bypassed
[1:09:15] there. Amen.
[1:09:20] After the shout
[1:09:23] There must come the
[1:09:27] voice. God bless
[1:09:30] you. The voice is the voice of
[1:09:34] resurrection. It is already in us.
[1:09:38] The voice. The Bible says
[1:09:41] Jesus cried with a loud
[1:09:45] voice and the the the graves were
[1:09:49] open and they did get
[1:09:52] out when he cried there at at the
[1:09:56] cross. That things didn't
[1:09:59] happen. But the Bible says it happened.
[1:10:04] But he cried there at the cross.
[1:10:08] He died there at the cross. He took her
[1:10:11] him at the cross. He put him in the in
[1:10:14] in in the
[1:10:15] grave. When he died there, he went to
[1:10:18] preach.
[1:10:20] Are they ready? If they come. Yes. All
[1:10:25] right. Let's stand up.
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:35] Let's pray.
[1:10:38] Mighty heavenly father, thank you for
[1:10:41] this
[1:10:44] weight. You are the only
[1:10:47] one who can place the weight in our
[1:10:53] hearts. We are just
[1:10:56] speaking. But the one who can take these
[1:10:59] words and build them to be
[1:11:01] something, you are the only one.
[1:11:04] This is the
[1:11:06] family. This is the body of our sister.
[1:11:09] In
[1:11:11] this we are taking the body out
[1:11:14] here. Taking her to where we are going
[1:11:17] to bury the
[1:11:20] body. We believe that you will move with
[1:11:23] us here.
[1:11:25] All the demon spirit will never remain
[1:11:27] here
[1:11:29] because we know when these things happen
[1:11:33] demons also want to take
[1:11:36] chance but now we are standing here we
[1:11:40] bind them so that they cannot be here in
[1:11:44] the name of the lord Jesus Christ we
[1:11:46] pray
[1:11:48] amen I don't know what is happening
[1:12:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:28] I'm just going to ask the brothers if
[1:12:30] they can just come and prepare the way
[1:12:33] cuz the hashes are here. We'll just sing
[1:12:37] one worship song and we will

[1:12:46] Fontaine Cemetery for those who don't
[1:12:50] know. So it's Zen Fontaine.
[1:12:55] Um it's just a cemetery on your way to
[1:12:58] town just just uh next to
[1:13:02] Sed.

[1:13:07] song since the pastor has closed with
[1:13:09] the prayer and
[1:13:13] then we'll be following the hashes to to
[1:13:17] the cemetery. Hallelujah. We can just
