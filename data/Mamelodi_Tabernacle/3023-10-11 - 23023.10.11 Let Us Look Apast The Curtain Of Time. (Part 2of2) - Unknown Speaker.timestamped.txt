[2:08] must
[2:09] [Music]
[2:15] see okay now now we let's pass this
[2:20] one but it
[2:22] says which we have
[2:25] seen with our
[2:28] eyes of
[2:33] the which we have looked
[2:36] upon and our hands have handled of the
[2:39] way of
[2:40] [Music]
[2:41] life that's it so it's something that
[2:45] happened back
[2:47] [Music]
[2:50] there you know to
[2:53] restore take something to where it
[2:58] was Amen to
[3:01] redeem is to take something back to
[3:04] where it
[3:06] was it's not it is not new
[3:10] there because it was
[3:13] there then it
[3:15] fell then now you redeem it back to that
[3:18] place
[3:22] again that's it now now now let's read
[3:27] here God bless you
[3:30] in in another book
[3:34] here the future
[3:37] home of the bright and the
[3:42] bright the future
[3:45] home of
[3:47] the
[3:51] and it
[3:53] says seven
[3:57] days deals with the old
[4:03] creation the world
[4:05] time and this is your seven
[4:09] days that's why it's called
[4:13] ages because it's
[4:19] ages that is s seven
[4:23] days
[4:25] [Music]
[4:27] that and he say
[4:31] and he says eight
[4:33] days the
[4:36] day with the new
[4:42] creation which it deals with
[4:45] [Music]
[4:47] eternity so you have two things
[4:50] here we
[4:54] yest
[4:55] one which is
[4:58] eternity
[5:09] now it's Time and
[5:13] Eternity because in the book of

[5:51] natural and the other part of it is
[5:54] [Music]
[5:55] superal now you
[5:58] yourself you are
[6:00] natural and another part of is
[6:04] superal so the message come in the
[6:09] [Music]
[6:14] same
[6:16] now one part of
[6:19] you is
[6:21] natural that part cannot
[6:28] see
[6:33] but you have
[6:36] another that's why you have the church
[6:38] ages and and

[8:37] times and it unfolded into something
[8:41] that I have
[8:46] seen I
[8:48] see I for
[8:54] interpret so that is the end of
[8:58] theeven
[9:01] it 1 2 3 4 5 6
[9:05] 7
[9:08] [Music]
[9:14] now you
[9:17] know
[9:19] josua before
[9:22] they comp
[9:28] Jer
[9:30] he met a man with a
[9:38] sword met

[9:52] times every
[9:54] [Music]
[9:56] day they
[9:58] take
[10:00] but on the seventh
[10:02] day he says to
[10:05] them go seven
[10:10] times they were counting
[10:14] days each
[10:16] day
[10:21] [Music]
[10:22] one the second

[11:09] days seven
[11:11] times amen so
[11:15] now he says it been seven
[11:19] times but the thing was still
[11:27] standing
[11:29] then he says he looked for the

[12:27] a
[12:29] within the pyramid
[12:31] here there was something
[12:36] mysterious when it was shown in a
[12:40] vision there

[14:33] ver4 when it 1 2 3 4 5
[14:38] 6 then he said don't write
[14:41] anything because the ministry was not of
[14:46] Jo the ministry
[14:49] wasend
[14:53] mess so John was forbidden to write
[14:57] anything
[15:00] [Music]
[15:08] that
[15:12] [Music]
[15:13] in because he
[15:16] says stop to
[15:24] write what John could not
[15:27] write the coming of the Lord
[15:31] [Music]
[15:32] hallu the that remain a
[15:37] secret
[15:41] coming

[15:51] come you know how a thief
[15:55] comes only notice when a thief is is in
[15:59] your
[16:01] house that's why the coming of the

[16:19] see but you will notice it after come to
[16:27] you
[16:29] amen without any specific
[16:36] appointment now the open of
[16:41] the is the coming of the
[16:52] lordes he was looking for the
[16:57] interpretation amen amen
[17:00] and he says now the Reas the reason to
[17:06] go

[17:40] Eastward don't
[17:43] know
[17:46] that I'll be starting from the
[17:51] West amen so the Bible says God plac his
[17:57] Adam
[18:07] because the
[18:08] gate was
[18:11] there it is called the East
[18:15] Gate amen that's where they went out
[18:19] when he drove them out they went out the
[18:23] east
[18:25] gate now at this East Gate
[18:28] [Music]
[18:37] that's they came to the gate
[18:40] toship at the gate now at the
[18:45] gate
[18:49] two with
[18:51] SW the way of
[18:54] [Music]
[18:57] of he put that man East
[19:00] [Music]
[19:02] one because the Bible
[19:04] says Christ will come from
[19:07] [Music]
[19:13] theast the ministry message the
[19:19] church started
[19:21] the and went
[19:25] West at the end time
[19:32] coming when he couldn't find
[19:36] [Music]
[19:40] interpret now I
[19:45] [Music]
[19:48] went and the reason I went
[19:52] West connect with this Angel's
[19:57] message
[20:00] [Music]
[20:08] is the Angel
[20:11] [Music]
[20:12] message because it was interpreted by
[20:16] the
[20:18] [Music]
[20:21] Angels the seven
[20:24] SE was interpreted by the Angels
[20:29] [Music]
[20:31] the seven Church
[20:33] Ages was interpret
[20:36] inter
[20:41] [Music]
[20:42] byel
[20:45] so one interpreted by an
[20:50] messenger and other by the
[20:55] angels
[20:57] from
[20:59] because that oneals with
[21:04] ET we can look at

[21:11] body which will come to
[21:14] that your
[21:16] body you have your Heaven
[21:22] body Heavenly Body amen and Earthly body
[21:30] yeah
[21:32] so you
[21:37] [Music]
[21:39] understand now
[21:42] inos say to
[21:45] you why the people the denominations the
[21:49] people cannot see these
[21:53] things it is because the prophet
[21:56] say you see it you see
[22:05] it your Heavenly
[22:08] Body was
[22:10] [Music]
[22:13] there now with your your down
[22:19] there you have seven
[22:23] Church Hallelujah that's
[22:26] why the people read seven
[22:30] church church

[22:52] because says you keep it up with your
[22:56] Heavenly Body
[22:59] [Music]
[23:02] because is inter
[23:07] Ang only up
[23:12] [Music]
[23:23] by last let
[23:26] this because we must take a
[23:31] bre the last time this for the last
[23:37] time uh that's why if we go back to the
[23:43] Bible can we take minutes on
[23:48] this we take minutes on
[23:51] [Music]
[23:53] this can take minutes
[23:56] this
[23:59] now in
[24:02] Genesis uh the Bible
[24:06] says there was
[24:11] no to the
[24:13] [Music]
[24:15] ground
[24:17] amen and God has now you you
[24:25] this this was on Earth
[24:29] this is your
[24:32] heaven
[24:35] and now there was no man
[24:40] on to the
[24:43] ground but there was a man in heaven
[24:46] which was a
[24:51] spirit that
[24:52] [Music]
[24:55] wasam so God was speaking from from the
[25:01] earth there was
[25:06] [Music]
[25:08] on then he had to bring down
[25:13] that because there
[25:19] ground speaking from
[25:22] [Music]
[25:23] here so he has to bring that man
[25:35] because the
[25:37] ground
[25:38] [Music]
[25:48] need
[25:53] only
[25:55] spirit and in this form
[25:58] he the
[26:04] ground into a body
[26:14] of he brought him
[26:16] down body
[26:21] of nature he became a living
[26:26] soul
[26:28] [Music]
[26:31] am so all the the plans the G was
[26:34] waiting for a
[26:44] [Music]
[26:45] maner not beer
[26:53] [Applause]
[26:54] [Music]
[26:56] without
[27:03] [Music]
[27:05] Garden of

[27:10] Eden Eden is the headquarters of
[27:15] [Music]
[27:26] God
[27:28] [Music]
[27:32] of the person
[27:37] was so it
[27:40] was vacant there was no one
[27:44] to
[27:47] ground and God to wait for a
[27:51] man and you know even the trees and the
[27:54] grass couldn't grow until at
[27:59] [Music]
[28:06] now you come to the
[28:10] superal and the
[28:12] say that is
[28:16] revelation there was
[28:18] no to open
[28:23] the
[28:25] am that is on the Earth
[28:32] open
[28:33] am and Genesis the that was in heav
[28:37] could not the
[28:40] [Music]
[28:46] [Music]
[28:51] ground not
[28:56] open
[29:00] [Applause]
[29:06] Hallelujah had to go
[29:10] west

[29:29] here and we byed our
[29:35] superal while we
[29:39] are we have another
[29:45] body so now
[29:49] brother had to make anel
[29:55] connection do you know about your angel
[30:02] did you know that you have
[30:09] [Music]
[30:20] [Music]
[30:26] anen
[30:29] the
[30:30] people that's why some cannot connect
[30:33] the
[30:36] seven because it is it is connected by

[31:47] it they Tri Africa to stop us from
[31:51] preaching
[31:56] things but we can
[31:59] stop because it's some
[32:03] something Beyond
[32:07] me and the only way it can
[32:12] connect has to connect to something that
[32:15] is beyond
[32:19] you that's how we see one
[32:24] another and that's how we can pray for
[32:26] one another
[32:28] because we can see one
[32:31] another through the Angelic
[32:39] connection I must
