[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:18] amen let's read from the book of Acts
[1:00:21] chapter 5
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] verse 14-
[1:00:33] 16
[1:00:35] amen and Believers were the more added
[1:00:39] to the Lord multitudes both of men and
[1:00:42] women in so much that they brought forth
[1:00:45] the sick into the streets and laid them
[1:00:48] on beds and couches that at the least
[1:00:51] the shadow of Peter passing by might
[1:00:54] overshadow some of them there came also
[1:00:58] a multitude out of the Cities round
[1:01:00] about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks
[1:01:05] and them which were infected with
[1:01:06] unclean spirits and they were healed
[1:01:09] everyone amen you may take your
[1:01:16] seat half of the quotes that I'm going
[1:01:19] to read
[1:01:21] here is praying
[1:01:26] amen amen my message this
[1:01:29] morning will be
[1:01:31] about the presence of God in his
[1:01:35] children I saw brother
[1:01:38] here I preached this message in
[1:01:41] L we were together that time so it's
[1:01:46] double portion for him this morning but
[1:01:48] my subtitle will
[1:01:50] be the power of your
[1:01:54] presence amongst the people
[1:01:56] people a CH a child of God is not just
[1:02:01] somebody who is
[1:02:04] ordinary but you are
[1:02:07] special you are
[1:02:09] present the people feel
[1:02:12] it because you were in the presence of
[1:02:16] God it's God first who bring his
[1:02:21] presence amongst
[1:02:23] us after that we see
[1:02:26] ourselves having the presence of God
[1:02:30] until when the people see us they see us
[1:02:35] differently amen amen Peter was
[1:02:39] ordinary but at the later stage he was
[1:02:43] no longer ordinary it was something else
[1:02:47] when God has visited you you are no
[1:02:50] longer ordinary you are Beyond
[1:02:53] ordinary you are no longer not just a
[1:02:56] human being you become a super human
[1:03:00] being until the people say there is one
[1:03:04] amongst us who is not like unto us
[1:03:08] that's a children of God Amen am H we we
[1:03:12] read
[1:03:13] here you know Peter when he was just a
[1:03:18] fisherman he was just like others but
[1:03:21] the day the Holy Ghost descended upon
[1:03:25] him
[1:03:26] the day he was
[1:03:28] transformed Jesus gave him a commission
[1:03:32] that the day you are
[1:03:34] transformed you shall strengthen your
[1:03:37] brothers so the strength that Peter had
[1:03:42] was to Cascade it to the
[1:03:45] others so when the people get strength
[1:03:49] they must get it from Peter because Lord
[1:03:52] God said the day you was transformed
[1:03:56] strengthen your
[1:03:59] brothers we need to know where God
[1:04:04] is let's not lie to one another let's
[1:04:08] tell the truth amongst one
[1:04:10] another God to whom you
[1:04:13] worship is in amongst
[1:04:16] us other people they just want to
[1:04:20] worship God who is in heaven but the
[1:04:24] very same God they Worship in heaven is
[1:04:27] here in
[1:04:30] us but if is in a man it becomes a
[1:04:34] stumbling
[1:04:36] block to other people you you read the
[1:04:40] whole chapter
[1:04:41] here you will see how it
[1:04:44] goes so Peter was just a man sent from
[1:04:50] God and he started preaching the word of
[1:04:54] God and he was not even aware of some of
[1:04:57] the things happening around
[1:05:00] him but the people made him
[1:05:04] aware that Peter you are no longer the
[1:05:07] same the person you used to
[1:05:10] be you are not that person anymore you
[1:05:13] are something else amen when you read
[1:05:17] here it says the
[1:05:20] Believers were more
[1:05:22] Ed and they came in multitude
[1:05:26] both men and women and they brought
[1:05:30] forth the
[1:05:31] seed into the
[1:05:33] street and lay them on the bed and
[1:05:39] coaches that at
[1:05:42] least the shadow of
[1:05:44] Peter might not overshadow SM overshadow
[1:05:48] some of
[1:05:50] them Peter was not
[1:05:53] aware said
[1:05:57] power he was not aware at all but the
[1:06:01] people made him aware that Peter if you
[1:06:06] can stand here and let the people pass
[1:06:10] by your Shadow they will be healed Peter
[1:06:13] was just standing
[1:06:16] there they said yes because the children
[1:06:19] of God has got in
[1:06:21] them Peter stood there the people passed
[1:06:25] and they were healed and the Bible says
[1:06:28] even the evil
[1:06:30] spirit went out of them from the shadow
[1:06:34] of Peter and that was the thing that
[1:06:39] happened first time since the world
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:47] began I want to show you
[1:06:50] something we believe
[1:06:53] this because we read it
[1:06:56] but we fail to see our present
[1:07:00] time take your shad and let the people
[1:07:04] pass no one will not be no one will be
[1:07:08] healed it's not the time of the Shad is
[1:07:12] something else God is God of the present
[1:07:17] time we need to lift him out of
[1:07:20] History if Peter sh heal the people
[1:07:25] rebuke the demons try today it will
[1:07:30] never
[1:07:31] work but you need to check what God is
[1:07:34] doing
[1:07:37] today amen if Jesus used the cl to heal
[1:07:43] the people try today it's not going to
[1:07:48] work you need to know the message of
[1:07:51] your time you you must recognize
[1:07:55] the message of your time what God is
[1:07:58] doing at your time you read the
[1:08:02] scripture from 17 going
[1:08:05] down let's just read it then the high
[1:08:10] priest rose up and all that were with
[1:08:15] him which the sect of the SES amen and
[1:08:20] were filled with indignation
[1:08:30] you can read it verse
[1:08:45] 17 amen they were
[1:08:48] angry Peter what are you doing what is
[1:08:53] your Shad of doing what are youying to
[1:08:56] do amen amen and lay their hands on the
[1:09:00] Apostle and put them in the common
[1:09:04] prison
[1:09:07] amen when they laid hands on
[1:09:10] them they were beaten them not just
[1:09:13] L
[1:09:15] amen but the angel of the
[1:09:19] Lord by Night opened the prison door and
[1:09:24] brought them forth
[1:09:25] and say go stand and speak in the temple
[1:09:30] to the people all the words of
[1:09:35] life when you stand with this
[1:09:39] gospel in times of Sorrow this gospel
[1:09:44] will stand for
[1:09:48] you and when they had that they entered
[1:09:52] into the temple
[1:09:55] early in the morning and
[1:09:59] Tau but the high priest came and they
[1:10:02] were with him and called the council
[1:10:07] together and all the Senate of the
[1:10:09] children of
[1:10:11] Israel and sent to the prison to have
[1:10:14] them
[1:10:17] bought but when the officers
[1:10:21] came and found them not in the prison
[1:10:25] they returned and
[1:10:28] told saying the prison truly found we
[1:10:32] shut with off
[1:10:36] safety and the keeper standing
[1:10:39] without before the doors but when we had
[1:10:44] open we found no man
[1:10:47] within now when the high priest and the
[1:10:49] captain of the
[1:10:52] temple and the chief priest
[1:10:56] had these things they doubted of them
[1:11:00] where unto this will
[1:11:04] grow then came one and told them saying
[1:11:10] behold the men whom you put in
[1:11:15] prison are standing in the
[1:11:18] temple and teaching the
[1:11:22] people you cannot stop the word of God
[1:11:27] Our God has never
[1:11:29] failed when God goes forward he goes
[1:11:33] forward no one can stop him they tried
[1:11:36] to stop them but the angel of God being
[1:11:41] God himself he came to their rescue and
[1:11:45] let them go on teaching the people about
[1:11:49] the word of God then verse 299 Peter
[1:11:53] said to them and the others Apostle
[1:11:56] answered and said we ought to obey
[1:12:01] God rather than
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:07] me amen then it ends like that but the
[1:12:12] people of that time because they never
[1:12:15] had this kind of an
[1:12:17] experience they couldn't see how God
[1:12:21] operates but the others that God knew
[1:12:26] and make them to believe they believed
[1:12:30] the message of that
[1:12:32] time you need to know the message of
[1:12:34] your time then the shadow of Peter
[1:12:38] became a solution to the people the
[1:12:41] people were too many he couldn't pray to
[1:12:44] them one by one a man of God just stand
[1:12:49] when they pass they get healed and the
[1:12:52] demons are gone forever
[1:12:58] amen amen you know a
[1:13:01] law is always a
[1:13:04] problem thou shall not thou shall not
[1:13:09] that is why brother BR came and preached
[1:13:14] about the 11th
[1:13:17] commandment amen the sovereignity of God
[1:13:21] when Grace take over because the Lord
[1:13:25] has failed the grace of God upon the
[1:13:29] people is the 11th
[1:13:31] commandment we are on the 11th
[1:13:35] commandment where the law of God I mean
[1:13:37] the grace of God is upon us so the
[1:13:42] priests the Senate the children of
[1:13:46] Israel they stick to the
[1:13:48] law and in the law they never saw a Shad
[1:13:53] healing the people
[1:13:56] it was a hindrance to them they decided
[1:13:59] to beat them put them in prison God take
[1:14:03] them out they continue preaching the
[1:14:05] word of
[1:14:06] God if the people stop you continue
[1:14:10] preach the word of
[1:14:15] God you cannot satisfice all the
[1:14:19] people amen if you try you will fail
[1:14:25] this thing started in heaven a person
[1:14:29] who
[1:14:30] created heaven and Earth all the people
[1:14:34] have seen how powerful he was but others
[1:14:38] just deny
[1:14:39] him who are you
[1:14:43] today for you to let everybody to
[1:14:47] believe your
[1:14:48] message can be it has never be it will
[1:14:52] never
[1:14:54] be amen even today when I preach
[1:14:59] others they don't believe but others
[1:15:03] believe is
[1:15:05] natural that is why when you preach
[1:15:09] don't please the people give what God
[1:15:12] has put in your heart give to the church
[1:15:16] those that believe will believe those
[1:15:19] that do not believe it's none of my
[1:15:21] business
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:30] amen amen that's how things are we see
[1:15:33] it in our families we see it in our work
[1:15:36] premises we see it in the churches we
[1:15:39] saw it in
[1:15:40] heaven others did not believe but others
[1:15:44] believe this morning others will believe
[1:15:47] others will never
[1:15:50] believe I'm telling you an honest truth
[1:15:53] sometimes we need to tell these
[1:15:56] things and not sugar goat things and not
[1:16:00] deceive one
[1:16:02] another others will believe others will
[1:16:05] never
[1:16:07] believe Amen brother in the message do
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:11] believe he he was
[1:16:14] praying when he prayed he said and now
[1:16:19] we pray that you will bless this
[1:16:22] handkerchief
[1:16:25] and we taught that in the
[1:16:27] Bible they took a
[1:16:29] handkerchief off of the body of
[1:16:32] Paul they leted them on the
[1:16:35] seek evil spirit went
[1:16:38] out amen we know we are not St
[1:16:42] Paul but we know that thou art still
[1:16:46] Christ so we pray that you honor this
[1:16:51] prayer of this church group of the
[1:16:55] people believing tonight and we send
[1:16:58] this hanger Chief to the sick and the
[1:17:02] needy in the name of your child Jesus
[1:17:05] Christ and God bless you he was praying
[1:17:09] brother and he knew what Paul did and
[1:17:12] now this time he know what God will be
[1:17:17] doing
[1:17:19] amen one
[1:17:22] day God said to brother
[1:17:25] if you can let the people believe in
[1:17:30] you amen believe in brother BR but the
[1:17:34] people will come and will say we don't
[1:17:37] believe in brother B we want to believe
[1:17:39] in God but when they go to God God said
[1:17:43] to them believe in brother
[1:17:46] Bren God whom you worship is here

[1:17:53] ourselves for God is

[1:18:03] contrary going that
[1:18:05] way for you for him to prove
[1:18:09] that you are just
[1:18:11] nothing amen but we know God has never
[1:18:16] failed let's continue then they took the
[1:18:20] handkerchiefs and the apron from Paul
[1:18:24] and got
[1:18:26] healed that's how they got salvation on
[1:18:30] that
[1:18:32] day amen but try the handkerchief today
[1:18:36] they will never work it's not the time
[1:18:38] of Paul it's another

[1:18:46] store for
[1:18:48] you

[1:18:54] believe that it was
[1:18:56] Paul that did this it was your spirit

[1:50:28] working for them so be
[1:50:33] it if that picture is not working for
[1:50:36] you it's none of my
[1:50:40] business because the shadow of Peter has
[1:50:43] worked for the people but the others
[1:50:47] were dying there because they denied the
[1:50:49] power that was in Peter a handerchief of
[1:50:53] Paul work for others the of
[1:50:58] brother of fire work for others that
[1:51:02] didn't they died there but sister
[1:51:05] survived the prayer of the sister
[1:51:09] brought down the plane down
[1:51:16] here don't convince me to believe what
[1:51:19] you believe I need to have
[1:51:23] my personal
[1:51:24] experience with God don't recruit
[1:51:30] me because I know what I
[1:51:33] believe amen it's something is waiting
[1:51:37] for me it's not working for you don't
[1:51:41] try amen to make me to believe what you
[1:51:46] believe I you know every person has Bor
[1:51:52] with a gift from God that gift you have
[1:51:55] from God use it
[1:52:01] appropriately there will be people that
[1:52:04] will try to divert you but if you are
[1:52:07] careful if you know your position you
[1:52:10] will to the line you stay for what we
[1:52:14] believe
[1:52:16] in amen amen I'm reading the last quote
[1:52:20] here God's provided way
[1:52:24] brother Bram says he said now we can
[1:52:28] preach the way explain the way but you
[1:52:32] have to receive the way if you do not
[1:52:35] receive the way it's not helping me in
[1:52:38] any because the word has been preached
[1:52:42] the word is been explained but you as an
[1:52:45] individual you must receive it so that
[1:52:48] it can be in your heart
[1:52:52] when you receive it it's the
[1:52:55] Revelation something slipped out of the
[1:52:59] Unseen
[1:53:03] World come rolling
[1:53:06] down through a mystical
[1:53:09] Channel somewhere into your
[1:53:12] soul say now I
[1:53:17] see your eyes
[1:53:20] brighten your lips that hang
[1:53:24] straighten up and a smile every
[1:53:28] muscle in your body seem to Rejoice
[1:53:32] something is going to happen you don't
[1:53:35] need to be in a prayer
[1:53:38] life then you got it
[1:53:43] there brother Bram here is telling
[1:53:47] us he is not saying the
[1:53:50] church he's saying
[1:53:53] to an
[1:53:54] individual something from from from
[1:53:57] Unseen World will come
[1:54:01] roll right in your heart when it's in
[1:54:04] your heart it's you and
[1:54:07] God you and God no that person can try
[1:54:13] amen to move you out of there amen am in
[1:54:18] the Old Testament the children of Israel
[1:54:21] they were taught when they
[1:54:23] leave the hand of
[1:54:26] Moses they shall receive
[1:54:30] Victory amen amen if they can say they I
[1:54:36] will and leave their hands
[1:54:38] down they got defeated the best thing
[1:54:42] they must leave those hands leave the
[1:54:44] hands of the men of God you shall
[1:54:47] receive Victory if you let them go down
[1:54:51] you got defeated
[1:54:54] you know the
[1:54:55] focus on that wall was at the hand of
[1:55:02] Moses in your closet you can
[1:55:06] go and PR harder God will never hear
[1:55:09] that prayer because you need to lift the
[1:55:13] hands of
[1:55:14] Moses that's what he one that was the
[1:55:17] standard of the
[1:55:20] day amen amen you you remember the other
[1:55:23] time when the Israelites were at War
[1:55:27] when they were at War they were carrying
[1:55:29] a coffin going to bury it and the Bible
[1:55:33] says when the enemies come they throw
[1:55:36] that person into the you know grave
[1:55:39] where the Prophet
[1:55:42] slept he came to life when he wake
[1:55:47] up he was
[1:55:49] surprised what is happening here
[1:55:53] the people are running away he just woke
[1:55:56] up from the dead he
[1:55:58] resurrected that's how far the word of
[1:56:00] God
[1:56:02] go amen
[1:56:10] amen you need to
[1:56:13] believe the word of the time if there's
[1:56:16] a
[1:56:17] experience that God gives you in your
[1:56:20] time stick to
[1:56:23] eat you might bring the handkerchief
[1:56:26] they might not work for you you might
[1:56:28] think you are Shadow work it cannot work
[1:56:31] for others but if you have something
[1:56:34] that has God has put in our time stick
[1:56:38] to
[1:56:41] that I know pictures are many and we
[1:56:46] differ there are those preachers that
[1:56:48] will just read the Bible and everybody
[1:56:51] will say Amen are those preachers that
[1:56:53] will quote the prophet everybody will
[1:56:55] say Amen there are those preachers will
[1:56:58] go deeper in the word of God the deeper
[1:57:01] people will say Amen others will be
[1:57:03] sleeping in the
[1:57:08] CH in the church that's where you see
[1:57:14] characters the the the thing another
[1:57:16] thing most of the people hate about the
[1:57:19] message when you did not come to church
[1:57:23] we phone
[1:57:27] you and you got angry and
[1:57:41] then if you not
[1:57:46] there and then it annoys many
[1:57:52] this ones have
[1:57:53] started and when somebody is
[1:57:58] tired you will try this and
[1:58:04] that you can
[1:58:07] even put him on the chair and then he
[1:58:10] will sleep right there because you have
[1:58:12] dragged him along here we need to come
[1:58:15] to a
[1:58:16] place no one is drinking us When Sunday
[1:58:21] Come brother Bram says we can't stay at
[1:58:25] all you wait for them gazes to get
[1:58:29] open wait for the door to get open
[1:58:32] because this is the right place to be
[1:58:34] that's why we worship
[1:58:37] Him amen amen but those that do not you
[1:58:40] know I I love God and God has never made
[1:58:44] a
[1:58:45] mistake with with our naked eye we may
[1:58:49] look at things differently and think
[1:58:52] things could have happened this way but
[1:58:55] God has start them
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:01] differ as D was saying
[1:59:05] something you know some of the things
[1:59:08] you may feel pity but you know God knows
[1:59:12] all there's a reason behind it we don't
[1:59:16] know God knows and God has never
[1:59:20] disappointed
[1:59:24] but God want them in this
[1:59:27] way who are we to blame
[1:59:33] God as I was saying somebody threatened
[1:59:37] me the other day that you will kill
[1:59:39] me said well if I died today doesn't
[1:59:43] matter are you going to live 100
[1:59:51] years the point is if I die today sooner
[1:59:56] or later you will be buried what you
[2:00:01] benefited I'm not scared of death and
[2:00:04] when I say this I know my wife doesn't
[2:00:07] like it because every time when I drive
[2:00:10] I say two things when I come back home
[2:00:13] alive let's praise God when I come back
[2:00:17] home with a coffin so be itat we live to
[2:00:21] die as long as raptes we shall see him
[2:00:25] through death don't be scared of death
[2:00:30] don't be scared of
[2:00:33] criticism stay for the cause that God
[2:00:37] has put you in there's a reason behind
[2:00:40] that Moses was born to take the children
[2:00:43] of Israel out
[2:00:46] of
[2:00:49] Jordan Beyond Jordan is
[2:00:53] Joshua even if he would love to be there
[2:00:57] physically but God said you end
[2:01:03] here the day you were born the day you
[2:01:06] will die only God who knows about them
[2:01:11] we don't know what is telling us is this
[2:01:14] we must just always be
[2:01:16] ready that's all God bless you let's
[2:01:19] stand to our feet and our quot amen
