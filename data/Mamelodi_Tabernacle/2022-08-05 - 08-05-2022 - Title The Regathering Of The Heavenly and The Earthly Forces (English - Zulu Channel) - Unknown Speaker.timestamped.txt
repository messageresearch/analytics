[54:54] [Music]
[55:04] my prophet says there is not enough
[55:07] honor to give
[55:09] to a mother
[55:13] i am speaking to
[55:16] real true
[55:18] and good mothers
[55:21] you know
[55:24] i always say
[55:28] the mother
[55:30] has got an ability
[55:32] that no one can have
[55:35] here on earth
[55:37] god has given to them a special
[55:41] a special gift
[55:43] a special ability
[55:45] which is
[55:47] to
[55:48] develop the seed
[55:50] to give it a shape
[55:52] and bring it to achievement
[55:57] i thought i would hear amen
[56:02] and that's a man cannot do that
[56:06] you need
[56:08] a mother to do that
[56:11] that's why
[56:12] prophecy she's so precious
[56:15] because she give a sense to life
[56:20] and the life will not have any sense
[56:22] unless there is a man
[56:27] all great men of
[56:29] history of this world
[56:33] if there is a credit to give to their
[56:35] life
[56:36] it is to their mothers
[56:40] you want to be successful in life
[56:43] honor the good mother that god has given
[56:46] to you
[56:47] amen
[56:50] [Music]
[56:54] isaac did not know the
[56:56] secret but rebecca knew the secrets
[57:02] isaac the prophet even called for issue
[57:04] to bless you
[57:06] though was the prophet
[57:09] but rebecca had a secret from god
[57:13] and she went behind it i see the prophet
[57:16] becoming serious
[57:19] [Music]
[57:22] but this is the bible
[57:27] rebecca knew the secret
[57:30] and
[57:32] she told the
[57:34] jacob
[57:35] what your father said is not that said
[57:37] alone
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:53] there's a is behind that
[57:56] if moses could become the great
[57:59] deliverer
[58:00] it's because of their mother
[58:04] and the missionary age of the open door
[58:07] of john wesley
[58:08] was because of his mother
[58:12] and if there is a credit to give
[58:15] to great men today
[58:17] because there was a good woman behind
[58:20] i am saying that this morning for you
[58:22] mothers to understand
[58:24] what is the responsibility that god has
[58:27] given unto you and i love and appreciate

[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:09] hallelujah
[1:00:11] and this morning
[1:00:13] i'm here to sit down and listen
[1:00:19] because if god wants to speak to you
[1:00:23] god will not pick
[1:00:25] a tree and bring it here and make the
[1:00:28] wings and start saying my son hear my
[1:00:31] voice
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:33] god will take a man
[1:00:37] god will put on a suit
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] unfortunately
[1:00:53] the only way god can speak to us
[1:00:56] is true amen
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:02] sometimes people
[1:01:05] they want to hear god
[1:01:07] they want to see a dream
[1:01:10] they want to see
[1:01:13] all those sort of things
[1:01:15] but i believe if god loves you
[1:01:18] he speaks to you behind the prophet
[1:01:22] and you say amen
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:26] hallelujah
[1:01:28] so this morning you know
[1:01:31] as we were going through
[1:01:33] thinking of the things that the lord has
[1:01:36] done for us to thank him
[1:01:40] to say lord we thank you
[1:01:43] jesus speaks about the parables of
[1:01:47] those 10 lepers people that were prayed
[1:01:51] for
[1:01:53] and a group
[1:01:54] left and
[1:01:56] never came back
[1:01:58] but another group came back
[1:02:00] and said thank you
[1:02:04] the bible say be thankful unto the lord
[1:02:07] for one yesterday
[1:02:09] count what the lord has done amen
[1:02:12] and every time you are counting what the
[1:02:15] lord has done i remember the people
[1:02:19] that the lord is used
[1:02:21] to do good unto you
[1:02:25] sometimes when we go around and think of
[1:02:28] those people
[1:02:29] we like to call them around us
[1:02:32] to show unto them our life
[1:02:34] because it's not just by speaking just
[1:02:37] by saying it must be our actions
[1:02:40] we call them around and say
[1:02:43] let's come
[1:02:44] and sit down together and remember the
[1:02:46] goodness of the lord
[1:02:50] and that's why we are here and we
[1:02:52] thought that our pastor should come and
[1:02:54] bless us
[1:02:56] and we thank him always for his
[1:02:58] availability
[1:02:59] and the love that he has shown unto us
[1:03:03] living in a difficult world where people
[1:03:06] reject one another
[1:03:08] people dislike one another
[1:03:11] people betray one another
[1:03:14] but when you find somebody who loves you
[1:03:18] you need to value that
[1:03:21] you need to appreciate
[1:03:23] you need to express your appreciation
[1:03:27] because god loves that to see somebody
[1:03:30] who can appreciate
[1:03:33] the lord has blessed us with a wonderful
[1:03:36] gift
[1:03:37] in this land
[1:03:40] and he has been a great help
[1:03:43] us
[1:03:44] in the ministry
[1:03:46] in past all these years we have been
[1:03:49] together
[1:03:50] in the field fighting the enemy
[1:03:54] taking the gospel
[1:03:56] further in the hearts of the people
[1:03:58] and we are so thankful to the lord that
[1:04:01] he has kept him
[1:04:02] and inspiring him
[1:04:05] more and more
[1:04:07] and filling his heart with so many good
[1:04:10] things
[1:04:12] when he speaks there is just so many
[1:04:15] good things that comes out
[1:04:17] and i believe you are going to be
[1:04:19] blessed
[1:04:20] i want you to stand on your feet
[1:04:23] as we going to welcome the pastor
