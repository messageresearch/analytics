[42:01] Lord indeed as the song says we are
[42:03] ready we are ready gracious
[42:06] Lord we like to thank you
[42:09] Father that we can
[42:12] feel the power of the commander of the
[42:15] host within us this
[42:20] morning he is here is with us this

[42:32] going right they should go
[42:35] right gracious Lord this morning we just
[42:38] want to
[42:39] stand against the wrong
[42:43] nature the nature that is
[42:46] against the will of the
[42:49] Lord there Bible
[42:53] says what I want to do I don't do
[42:58] and that that I want don't want to do
[43:00] that's what I
[43:01] do because Lord there is a wrong nature
[43:05] that Paul spoke
[43:06] about that there are two Natures that
[43:09] are fighting from
[43:12] within gracious Lord we pray for the
[43:14] nature of Christ in
[43:16] us because without the nature of
[43:20] Christ we can say that we are
[43:23] ready and we are lying to ourselves
[43:27] each and every one of us we know that
[43:29] we've got situations that we are faced
[43:32] with but gracious Heavenly Father you
[43:34] have said those who will
[43:37] overcome gracious Lord they shall
[43:40] inherit what you have placed for us Lord
[43:43] in
[43:44] heaven gracious Lord we pray for the
[43:46] service this

[44:10] touched with our hands because we were
[44:12] there H you just processed us father to
[44:17] be born gracious heavenly
[44:19] father father but we like to thank you
[44:23] that your blood has managed father to
[44:26] wash everything that was not going right
[44:29] so that the nature of Christ should be
[44:31] the one that will stand
[44:34] forever we pray for the Perfection of
[44:36] your bride this
[44:38] morning we pray father for those who are

[45:29] casting out father those who are against

[45:32] service in the name of Jesus you Satan I
[45:35] command you by the power that has
[45:39] invested in us as the sons of the most
[45:41] high God we say this service it will be
[45:47] led by the commander chief which is is
[45:50] Christ
[45:51] himself thank you Heavenly Father we
[45:53] pray for the word as my father the man
[45:57] of God that we have prepared this
[45:58] morning will come we pray for him father
[46:02] that you Lord let everything father be
[46:04] done which is coming from you Lord this
[46:08] is the only pulpit and the pulpit father
[46:11] that has been Lord spread all over the
[46:15] world and I we still believe even this

[46:20] this
[46:21] pet because the Angel and the commander
[46:25] and the host is share with us father
[46:29] thank you Lord as I give you the glory

[46:35] [Applause]
[46:42] amen as
[46:44] we welcome the
[46:47] specials will come up for you
[46:51] [Music]
[46:55] Jesus for
[47:00] [Music]
[47:06] [Music]
[47:12] [Music]
[47:21] [Music]
[47:34] for
[47:58] like to greet the Saints in the name of
[48:01] our Lord and
[48:02] Savior Jesus Christ
[48:05] amen
[48:07] uh it is always a
[48:10] privilege and an honor
[48:13] Amen to to stand before the children of
[48:18] God opportunities like this we we do not
[48:22] take them for granted
[48:24] amen because
[48:27] sometimes issues of life may cause you
[48:30] not to come
[48:31] amen
[48:34] so David said I was glad when they said
[48:37] unto me let us go into the house of the
[48:41] Lord because in the house of the Lord
[48:43] there is fullness of joy there is the
[48:47] presence of
[48:48] God and where the presence of God is
[48:54] [Music]
[48:56] so B I was listening to the prayer of
[49:00] the Elder Almighty the
[49:03] commander and chief is
[49:07] here uh I had asked for a scripture in
[49:11] the Book of
[49:12] Job I won't belong I promise that that I
[49:16] won't belong
[49:17] amen so that scripture in Job chapter
[49:22] 9 verse 32 and 33
[49:27] if maybe the brothers can
[49:29] help sorry not to rush you
[49:33] Brothers um the song that I'm about to
[49:36] sing is connected to the
[49:39] scripture
[49:45] amen
[49:47] hallelujah I don't know if the brothers
[49:50] are able to display Job chapter 9: 32
[49:53] and 33
[49:57] I promise to keep time
[50:00] amen oh it's there already oh I'm
[50:03] looking at there sorry sorry brother
[50:07] amen uh sorry I'll have to tell amen cuz
[50:10] I need to
[50:14] read yes for he is not a man as I
[50:19] am this is a man what that was speaking
[50:22] out of frustration and stress amen not
[50:25] knowing why am I judged
[50:30] condemned attempt
[50:33] broken but the second verse which is
[50:38] 33 as we read on on 32
[50:42] it he's not a man as I am that I should
[50:46] answer him and we should come together
[50:49] in
[50:51] judgment but the second verse brothers
[50:55] and 33
[51:00] yes and it says neither is there any
[51:03] DeMent between
[51:07] us that might lay his hands upon us
[51:13] both to me that scripture speaks of John
[51:20] 3:16 God coming down as a man and also
[51:27] as God two
[51:30] Natures because the man that was needed
[51:32] here was had the capabilities of laying
[51:37] his hands on
[51:39] men and also laying his hands on
[51:43] God so that there should be
[51:46] peace and
[51:48] connection between man and God
[51:51] hallelujah so we thank Baba that prayer
[51:55] as you said the Chief the Commander in
[51:58] Chief is
[52:00] here that is that is why even this
[52:02] morning even when choosing a pastor we
[52:05] we have to be careful because we need a
[52:08] man who has two
[52:10] Natures to
[52:13] connect that which is in heaven and that
[52:16] which is on
[52:17] Earth the Commander in Chief
[52:21] amen he is with
[52:24] me everywhere

[1:38:50] 13-6 and they brought young children to
[1:38:53] him that he should touch them and his
[1:38:56] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:38:58] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:39:01] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:39:04] little children to come unto me and
[1:39:06] forbid them not for of such is the
[1:39:08] kingdom of God verely I say unto you
[1:39:12] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:39:15] of God as a little child he shall not
[1:39:17] enter therein and he took them up in his
[1:39:20] arms put his hands upon them and bless
[1:39:24] them
[1:39:25] amen there are three things which are

[1:40:21] troops so that they can cannot bear
[1:40:23] children

[1:40:35] judgments because God has given
[1:40:38] them so that they must bear
[1:40:44] children and look after
[1:40:48] them it's not the responsibility of men
[1:40:54] women will be
[1:40:57] saved when they stay in
[1:41:02] faith and bearing
[1:41:07] children if you problem with bearing
[1:41:12] children you must come to the

[2:03:22] with part of
[2:03:25] himself what is part of
[2:03:31] himself part of himself is the word of
[2:03:37] God part of himself is the
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:44] theop our Prophet say
[2:03:48] here because he has preached the message
[2:03:50] with this

[2:04:17] communion and since
[2:04:20] then it was settled
[2:04:26] forever if if he gave
[2:04:32] Abraham and that communion was part of

[2:05:11] Christ hundreds and hundreds of years
[2:05:17] later but
[2:05:19] MC after his child Abraham had won the
[2:05:27] victory met
[2:05:29] him and gave him wine and
[2:05:34] bread showing that after this itly

[2:06:56] home that is right the second tells us
[2:07:02] that we meet him in the
[2:07:06] air a beautiful type of Rebecca meeting
[2:07:12] Isaac in the
[2:07:16] field we meet him in the
[2:07:20] air as we have read second
[2:07:25] Thessalonians we have three comings of
[2:07:27] the
[2:07:30] Lord the first coming of the
[2:07:33] Lord it was when he come to redeem
[2:07:38] us you know about that that was the
[2:07:42] first
[2:07:43] coming and the second coming of the
[2:07:47] Lord it was when it was when he come
[2:07:52] to claim
[2:07:56] us that is the
[2:07:58] second that is what we call the
[2:08:03] Rapture that is his
[2:08:06] second then the third
[2:08:09] coming let me just read what the
[2:08:13] prophet everything travel is in
[2:08:17] three with
[2:08:19] god god is perfect in
[2:08:23] three first coming of
[2:08:27] Christ to redeem his
[2:08:30] brother second coming of
[2:08:32] Christ to receive his
[2:08:35] bride the third coming of
[2:08:38] Christ coming with his

[2:09:06] promise that you will come
[2:09:09] again to
[2:09:12] us are you
[2:09:14] together but we know
[2:09:17] that to understand his second
[2:09:24] we must look at his first
[2:09:29] coming then if we can look at this first
[2:09:34] coming then we shall understand his
[2:09:40] second because first
[2:09:42] coming when we read Mal
[2:09:45] 3 in other
[2:09:48] scriptures but let's look
[2:09:52] 3
[2:09:54] ver1 can read my
[2:09:57] brother my brother is not
[2:09:59] here not doesn't matter can you read
[2:10:10] it Mal 3 3
[2:10:15] ver1 behold I will send my messenger and
[2:10:20] he shall prep prepare the way before me
[2:10:24] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[2:10:26] suddenly come to his Temple even the
[2:10:30] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[2:10:32] Delight in behold he shall come said the
[2:10:38] Lord of hosts amen he's talking about
[2:10:42] the
[2:10:44] messenger coming before
[2:10:47] him to forun his coming
[2:10:52] and he says the Lord whom you are
[2:10:55] looking
[2:10:57] for will soon come to his
[2:11:00] temp there were there are other
[2:11:03] scriptures which were talking about his
[2:11:07] coming and the children the people
[2:11:11] there the Jews there they were looking
[2:11:15] for his
[2:11:17] Com when they were looking for his
[2:11:21] in the different
[2:11:24] synagogue in in the in the
[2:11:26] temple they were singing about him
[2:11:31] coming they were
[2:11:33] happy expecting
[2:11:35] him to
[2:11:37] come but while they were still singing
[2:11:41] and happy about
[2:11:45] him something happened my
[2:11:48] brother the angel met the
[2:11:54] vision it was a secret
[2:12:00] meeting known only by the
[2:12:05] V and they their
[2:12:08] talks when they were
[2:12:11] communicated at the end of their
[2:12:14] talk said let it be done unto
[2:12:19] me as you are
[2:12:23] sa and the angel
[2:12:28] left it was the start of the
[2:12:34] process of the
[2:12:37] coming of the
[2:12:41] Lord no one was aware of
[2:12:45] that they were singing in the
[2:12:49] temple just like now
[2:12:52] people are
[2:12:53] singing in different
[2:12:56] places waiting for him to
[2:12:59] come some say they're waiting for the
[2:13:02] Rapture but they didn't know the
[2:13:07] processes because in the first
[2:13:11] coming the
[2:13:12] vision made
[2:13:16] the and in the second
[2:13:19] country VIs
[2:13:25] because it is the same
[2:13:30] process after the vision has
[2:13:34] made who was
[2:13:37] mared he got she got
[2:13:43] pregnant she knew she was
[2:13:48] pregnant from the way
[2:13:53] our
[2:13:54] Prophet said to
[2:13:58] us the
[2:14:00] W is in
[2:14:04] the just like
[2:14:07] it it means the bread has met the
[2:14:13] angel because for the way to be in
[2:14:17] Mary Mary the angel
[2:14:21] Mary for the way to be in
[2:14:24] maryy received the
[2:14:28] angel then when the prophet says the
[2:14:32] weight is in the
[2:14:34] bride just like it was in
[2:14:37] Mary is the brightest
[2:14:41] Med and the brightest received the
[2:14:44] weight
[2:14:49] from amen
[2:14:52] that was the process of his
[2:14:57] coming when we
[2:15:01] read verse 13 to
[2:15:04] 17 is when
[2:15:07] John because John was his
[2:15:10] for when he was baptizing
[2:15:14] there way it came
[2:15:17] there when it came there there was a men
[2:15:22] there that man was the son of
[2:15:26] Mary he was born from
[2:15:29] Mary but when he was
[2:15:32] there then when he wanted to be baptized
[2:15:34] by
[2:15:36] John was baptized by
[2:15:38] John the the weight came down the pillar
[2:15:43] of fire and when the pillar of ours came
[2:15:47] in it was the Fulfillment of Malachi
[2:15:50] chapter 3
[2:15:54] it was God whom they were looking
[2:15:58] for coming to his
[2:16:03] Temple then we have got
[2:16:06] processes we have 10 ver
[2:16:14] 1 talking about the
[2:16:17] angel coming down with a
[2:16:19] book open book and we were
[2:16:23] T that he took the book and gave to the
[2:16:29] seventh and we are
[2:16:31] told when this Angel come
[2:16:34] down there was another
[2:16:37] man just like when this when
[2:16:42] come John was here then when this man
[2:16:47] come there was another man
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:53] Amen to receive
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:01] that those this
[2:17:04] thing the prophet says I don't say he is
[2:17:09] coming I say he is

[2:24:36] died they they joined them
[2:24:39] there then from the first church
[2:24:43] age
[2:24:45] there
[2:24:47] there the first the second the Third
[2:24:51] they
[2:24:52] died
[2:24:54] them until the
[2:24:57] seven the age we are living in I told
[2:25:01] you physically are living in now
[2:25:06] year
[2:25:07] but we
[2:25:12] are we are
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:17] above when
[2:25:21] he will move from the
[2:25:25] seventh and went to the
[2:25:28] six and took all those
[2:25:32] things they are in their
[2:25:36] theop and they will come
[2:25:39] down to the
[2:25:41] end to come to take another
[2:25:45] body because you have got three types of
[2:25:48] B
[2:25:51] this is the
[2:25:52] body then the body number one is called
[2:25:58] terrestrial then you have got the second
[2:26:01] one which is the
[2:26:04] theop
[2:26:05] then the Saints who have
[2:26:09] died they are in their theop
[2:26:18] there Hallelujah
[2:26:20] when I
[2:26:23] said when Abraham Met
[2:26:36] m this is this is this is the
[2:26:43] age the age of the revelation of the
[2:26:48] white stone now
[2:26:56] the stone which was
[2:27:06] not brother went to the
[2:27:10] west to
[2:27:14] connect with
[2:27:18] hisop amen do you know know
[2:27:21] that all right if you don't know
[2:27:25] it just
[2:27:31] listen he he said that there was an
[2:27:34] angel
[2:27:36] there a
[2:27:40] notable when we read the
[2:27:43] books he was a flying interpretation
[2:27:52] but when you read chapter
[2:27:55] one we are told about an
[2:27:58] angel who was telling
[2:28:02] John all these
[2:28:05] things John even tried to worship
[2:28:09] that and the angel
[2:28:11] said I
[2:28:13] am one of one of the
[2:28:18] prophets don't worship me
[2:28:22] and when we follow that
[2:28:24] danger we find it
[2:28:29] there that is the the
[2:28:33] theop of the
[2:28:39] man when God gave
[2:28:43] him he must give him the theop
[2:28:50] when God gives us
[2:28:54] P he must give us
[2:29:00] the are you
[2:29:02] listening you see people talk about
[2:29:05] receiving the
[2:29:10] holy the anointing
[2:29:14] now is above seven Church
[2:29:20] the anointing
[2:29:22] now is the anointing of the
[2:29:29] logos have you in the early
[2:29:34] ages they would ask you have you
[2:29:38] received the Holy Ghost since you
[2:29:42] believe but now it's no more the
[2:29:46] case now have you received have you
[2:29:51] [Applause]
[2:29:53] met that is that is
[2:29:57] this we ask if you have
[2:30:02] met because this the time of
[2:30:06] [Applause]
[2:30:10] meeting when the seals were open
[2:30:14] amen because brother had to meet
[2:30:22] with the
[2:30:24] supernatural with the
[2:30:26] theop so that he can bring
[2:30:32] down because opening
[2:30:35] the is opening
[2:30:40] Christ and that's why when the SE were
[2:30:45] open John
[2:30:48] said I might have seen beyond the K
[2:30:52] of I saw John
[2:30:56] [Applause]
[2:30:57] there because opening the
[2:31:00] seals is bringing back our
[2:31:06] theop is bring is bringing back part of
[2:31:12] God where is
[2:31:15] of because part of God is the way

[2:31:44] we you are
[2:31:46] receiving the CES
[2:31:50] building up to your
[2:31:54] theop because when they
[2:31:56] come when they come they come in their
[2:32:00] theop and they found us here in
[2:32:04] this but only those who have got the
[2:32:07] theop in
[2:32:10] them they will connect the
[2:32:13] theop you cannot connect with these
[2:32:17] ones if you don't have
[2:32:20] part of
[2:32:23] them you must have received
[2:32:30] your
[2:32:35] see will
[2:32:38] finish and when this body
[2:32:41] finishes then we
[2:32:43] together we shall take other
[2:32:48] bodies I said is this
[2:32:51] one
[2:32:55] terrestrial and
[2:32:57] glori which are going to wear
[2:33:01] them during
[2:33:05] Rapture when those brothers and sisters
[2:33:08] come in their
[2:33:11] theop then we also we shall
[2:33:15] change but we
