TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] David said he was happy when he &gt;&gt; and said to him, "Let us go into the house of the Lord. [Music] And I'm also happy to be here with my pastor and all my friends who who is part of my home. And &gt;&gt; so I'm so thankful to God that in this last days he brought us together again. We are together again. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And as we were together &gt;&gt; and before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; and we are together again. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam says this is the the last gathering. &gt;&gt; The gathering of the eagles. [Music] &gt;&gt; The deed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we are so happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning [Music] &gt;&gt; there was no place I could go to this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But to this place &gt;&gt; where the eagles are gathered together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where we find our beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Pastor S. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, [Music] &gt;&gt; we I enjoyed the singing so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I just feel that we are &gt;&gt; in heaven places &gt;&gt; and it gives us joy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now I'm here to support my pastor here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know we always believe that no one can speak better &gt;&gt; than God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that's why we all believe that we are just all equals &gt;&gt; and uh in equals is that one is made a pastor to speak &gt;&gt; the other one is the hearer &gt;&gt; but we are just all equals &gt;&gt; you know I I understand that the teacher in the classroom And his job is to reveal what is in a student. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something in a student. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the work of a teacher is to reveal that &gt;&gt; and I understand if you fail standard six maybe three times or what it is because you don't have standard &gt;&gt; six. Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; it's the same thing in God. &gt;&gt; Says the people who are here in the spiritual realms &gt;&gt; were there before. &gt;&gt; And the overcomers here &gt;&gt; were they overcame there. &gt;&gt; When there was a war in heaven, they were on the side of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; And because they overcame &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Then they will overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not newcomers in this field. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And so this what why we what we believe that because we were there brother says h we no one can see these things unless he was there. That means you won't see it from here &gt;&gt; from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so this is what we we have seen in the last days &gt;&gt; that you hear because you &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; You see because you have seen &gt;&gt; you see because you have seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay, let's turn back to our you know I I don't know especially on the first day like Sunday I just want to relax &gt;&gt; you know brother says this is relaxation &gt;&gt; because you are a child of God &gt;&gt; there's nothing to fear &gt;&gt; you don't we don't go to heaven because we fear to go to hell &gt;&gt; we are citizens [Music] We are citizens of heaven. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church because we fear to go to hell or we fear condemnation. &gt;&gt; We are citizens. [Music] &gt;&gt; Uh I will turn to Daniel chapter 12 again as we will just continue uh from when where we left yesterday. I think always feel like yeah and and at that time that is Daniel chapter 12. &gt;&gt; Amen. H so we are all here to rejoice again. &gt;&gt; Paul says rejoice in the Lord and I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; Now let's make this Sunday also another wonderful Sunday. &gt;&gt; The first day of the week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H which is the day of resurrection. And uh so um it is our day to observe. And at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people. And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time at at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book. &gt;&gt; And I will turn to verse six. And one one said or verse five. Daniel and I, Daniel looked, and behold, there was stood two men, &gt;&gt; the other on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on the other side of the river. &gt;&gt; One said to the men clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, how long shall it be &gt;&gt; to the end of uh this wonders? And I had the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river when he held up his hand and his left hand &gt;&gt; uh unto heaven. And so by him who live forever uh what it shall be for a time and times and and have and uh which he shall have accomplished. &gt;&gt; Uh the breaking up of the power of the holy people shall these things uh shall be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, it's another wonderful time. Wow. &gt;&gt; That day for us to come &gt;&gt; under this roof in the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; for to worship. &gt;&gt; And we know how we rejoice when we saw you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Claiming the framework. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we as the stars of heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rejoice before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; How much shall we rejoice? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we see these things now. Yes. &gt;&gt; Coming to a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Father, and exalt your name &gt;&gt; as we are here to hear from you again in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you. [Music] Now, um as we are here again this this morning. Okay. Um now we were looking at the pyramid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh whatever city is this thing on. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh we were up to the transition period &gt;&gt; where we see a girl. Hey, &gt;&gt; and uh that's where if you read seals chapter uh page 74. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I will read this part here. Page 74. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah came in the days, John knew he would see him &gt;&gt; because he was going to introduce him. &gt;&gt; And we realize that in the scriptures over in Malachi 4, there's to be a one like John &gt;&gt; and Elijah to him the word of God can come to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit all the mysteries of God and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Restore back all the mysteries that's been proved at through this denominational. Yes. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Now that's what the word said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just responsible for what it says. It's written. It's written. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now we see that this seven sealed book is the mystery of redemption. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now redemption as we all know is to take something back to its original place. &gt;&gt; Redemption. &gt;&gt; Now you are redeemed back to your original place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh now we should know uh which place is our original place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know brother Brennan says uh when God made you, he made you as your father. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh as he condescended from being a spirit &gt;&gt; in the rainbow form and condescended into a logos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. which the prophet says it's logos. It's a Christ is the way. &gt;&gt; So the same is the logos the Christ is the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says that's where we were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we come down in a threefold system. &gt;&gt; Glory. You know our God is systematic &gt;&gt; and he does things systematic &gt;&gt; and so now we we come down a a system the way he came. &gt;&gt; That's the way we came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the prophet says for God to come to you, he has to come in three steps. &gt;&gt; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. That's when he has reached. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And h the spirit logos. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's threefold. &gt;&gt; And so now because in the book Christ is the mystery of God revealed, he tells you that the bride is part of this three-fold mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you you you don't receive it by maybe uh raising up your hand &gt;&gt; but you rece you receive it as part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh part of God was there before. &gt;&gt; We always read in the book that the Bible says in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. And the Bible and verse six says and there was a man sent from God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if you you look at it carefully &gt;&gt; is that the word was God &gt;&gt; and there was a man sent from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it always we we always explain it's not as a man sent by God. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; But is a man sent from God. &gt;&gt; From God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that is sent from God be part of God. &gt;&gt; That's why he's not sent by God. He is sent from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that means he is part of God in so much that &gt;&gt; when he was on the he appeared on the scene &gt;&gt; men were sent &gt;&gt; to check whether he &gt;&gt; be the Christ of God &gt;&gt; and they said I am the voice &gt;&gt; of the one crying in the wilderness &gt;&gt; that is Isaiah 40 exactly &gt;&gt; which is his position in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so each and every one of us today must find his position &gt;&gt; in the way. &gt;&gt; As the Lord Jesus also, they handed to him the scroll. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says when he opened it, he found a place &gt;&gt; where it is written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is his part in the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as now we believe the message and what we believe &gt;&gt; because it's our part in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now um if if I am not part of him &gt;&gt; then the word calls me an outsider. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; H now it says I I will read this now &gt;&gt; as we see Revelation 10 verse 5 &gt;&gt; Daniel 12:5 &gt;&gt; they speak of an announcement &gt;&gt; and the angel said the time shall be no moreise &gt;&gt; and you can see the the very same same the two scriptures are identical. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because he's there at the river and you read there at the angel also because when he stepped one foot on the sea and the other on the land &gt;&gt; h the prophet tells me that the seventh angel messenger &gt;&gt; was here &gt;&gt; says he saw him when he stepped one foot on the Because one beast came out of the sea and the other out of the land. &gt;&gt; So now and he said I will make my means my enemies a foottool. So that means one beast out of the land one of the of the sea. That's why now he stepped one foot on the land and one foot on the sea. So now it shows that the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The seven seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Put Satan not &gt;&gt; so why because the my prophet tells me that &gt;&gt; the Satan don't know about the seven. Why we do a silent &gt;&gt; so that you switch off the activity. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; For a time &gt;&gt; because something was happening. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now says this, this is not revealed to the public. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He says now then he says I feel checked. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, because he says h &gt;&gt; he says h it is okay. I'll say it was something from a throne to a &gt;&gt; sle. &gt;&gt; Now when he took the move from the throne &gt;&gt; and then he walked to his throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's when he walked to brother &gt;&gt; his third [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; brother. [Music] Hallelujah. So now we are here to hear the voice [Music] in the bride. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know anything, you must [Applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We don't only just preach the word, we are the word. [Music] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, here we are. &gt;&gt; Now, we see this. Now, John was supposed to see the one he was supposed to introduce. &gt;&gt; Brother Bren was supposed to see the one &gt;&gt; he was supposed to introduce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we see that this seven seal book is a mystery of redemption. It's a book of redemption from God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this of this messenger. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There he is. The angel on earth &gt;&gt; and another angel mighty messenger came down. That is Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This angel was an earthly angel messenger. &gt;&gt; But here comes one down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. with a rainbow covenant. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, a rainbow covenant. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If we go to back to the original, &gt;&gt; we see that God appeared as a rainbow. &gt;&gt; We all know that. And uh in the time of Noah again [Music] &gt;&gt; the token of the covenant &gt;&gt; and that's why now we all fall under a sevenfold system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now because brother tells you of how the Lord Jesus is sevenfold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now simply if you take a a 5 lit container and you put seven liters &gt;&gt; it will spill over. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why people are saying the seven se is not revealed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have to become a six container and then if if we put the seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we will we will look at it and we will see that it is [Music] &gt;&gt; this book is the revelation of the seven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the revelation that we have received is of the seven of the &gt;&gt; Okay. Now here we are. Now here is the meeting of two angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. H one h covered in a rainbow. &gt;&gt; All right. Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh the other one you know the one come with a book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And because the one on earth has the seven churches &gt;&gt; responsible for that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's why the book of Revelation 22 says I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he is actually brother is a messenger. &gt;&gt; He is the eldest in the house [Music] &gt;&gt; because the eldest in the house. &gt;&gt; So that's why it took the eldest in the house &gt;&gt; to go for the pride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which it made him a marriage officer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary Rebecca to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, so now it says so. &gt;&gt; Now we are looking at this now. Now the two they met. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they met. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One from heaven, one from &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they met one with part of the tech and the other one with part of the tech. &gt;&gt; Lord the seven churches the seven seals to come and that tail together. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just there. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Now we are going to see how how he came to me or how he came to you. how he came to now with the Jews. &gt;&gt; He came walking. &gt;&gt; He was a man walking. &gt;&gt; That's the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But with the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; It was not like that. &gt;&gt; Although in in the other words it's like that &gt;&gt; we saw him walking. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Mechisedc was represented in the form of a man &gt;&gt; because today we are under Melkisedc. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which which when we reach the seventh series then the Mechisedc the prophet says then Melkisedc came into view. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which which which it says may kiss a deck. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let me read first. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now here we are. We start here now. H yesterday we were looking at this because we are coming up to where he says men and God met. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men and God met. &gt;&gt; Amen. When John met the Messiah, [Music] &gt;&gt; that was he was in a physical form. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And uh we couldn't say the people have met God. &gt;&gt; Because he was in a physical form. So they had to wait until he died, rose again so that what's in him may come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now that's why we we also come up the seven step &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; When he took the book from within himself, &gt;&gt; that was a mystery. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries were in him. Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; The book says for brotherham to reveal them &gt;&gt; to me. &gt;&gt; The lamb only opened the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He only opens. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and gave it to the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And the book says for him to reveal &gt;&gt; for him to reveal it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the people. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation &gt;&gt; is the word in a man. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not in a book. No. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; As I said yesterday, some some people are saying that they know the the seals because the first is a white horse. &gt;&gt; Now they talking about the symbol. &gt;&gt; Re the revelation. Revelation is the word in make flesh. &gt;&gt; When the word is in a man, then it's called re. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. before it reaches the heart of man is the word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it here in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, revelation is when it is in the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the word is not in a man is the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is there a &gt;&gt; That's why brother you read Christ the mystery as we all know these things I can just quote them but you know them very well. Christ is the mystery of God revealed &gt;&gt; where he says [Music] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible revelation &gt;&gt; because they say what makes heaven heaven is the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now h &gt;&gt; if I'm saying Christ is just a way &gt;&gt; but now it makes him a revelation only when he is in you &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; is that so brothers &gt;&gt; Christ in you is 33 in English here Christ is a mystery of Christ in you, &gt;&gt; not without. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you won't know God and until God is in &gt;&gt; you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will read because the prophet tells me here &gt;&gt; again in this book as we are going to read few of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In his book, he says &gt;&gt; the only way you know him is by receiving a threefold re. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way. &gt;&gt; No other way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way you'll know him &gt;&gt; is by a three-fold revelation. &gt;&gt; That's how he is known because the prophet says life is in the third. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are the set throne of God. &gt;&gt; The only way you know him, that's when you receive a threefold revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says that's the only way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh now here as I read here um Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Christ life in you makes him the center of life h of revelation. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible complete revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I talking to you? &gt;&gt; Now Christ in you &gt;&gt; makes you &gt;&gt; a complete [Music] &gt;&gt; You don't lack anything. and not not in the book in you &gt;&gt; in the church &gt;&gt; but in [Music] &gt;&gt; makes you &gt;&gt; only when he is in &gt;&gt; I am the inside. &gt;&gt; You see as yesterday we saw how Elijah Elisha Now we look at two things &gt;&gt; the ministry this side of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the other side of &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; on this side of Jordan there were so many believers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A brother said to me he's got about 80 members in the church. Is it a pastor? Said something like that. I don't know whether I said but what I I said even this morning I said to my fellow brother here that what is greater is not the quantity &gt;&gt; it is what is in the heart &gt;&gt; this church of God here or this part of the bride grade is not the number that &gt;&gt; Amen. So because even we know how the pyramid is shaping point [Music] it's not we we we are not talking of many people we are talking of the [Music] &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; all right many people with many troubles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of &gt;&gt; Christ is the all and in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in all it doesn't mean in all the people &gt;&gt; in all is in all who fall within the system. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the all of God. &gt;&gt; The all of God is is the places that he occupy. and and God is in you all of God. &gt;&gt; Because this is what he occupies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because did you know that man is a place? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here you are the places of God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whenever you see God walking, &gt;&gt; you know that is going to the heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; The word was coming not to a certain church. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; but to the predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word was sent to the predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. H let's turn to this now. Now we'll start with this uh the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which uh uh Ephesians 4 verse 13 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of which you are until the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; So we start there. That's when we see the books now being opened &gt;&gt; on that day of redemption. &gt;&gt; Because those who will be saved, they will be found in the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only those in the &gt;&gt; in the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only those in the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is responsible for that &gt;&gt; because he say but this book it's a book of mis it's a mysterious book &gt;&gt; it's a book of redemption &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now we know that the book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood &gt;&gt; no more &gt;&gt; it's proved 8 through six ages And at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound this mystery, he winds up all the loose ends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this fellows back there proved it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the mystery come down from God as the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And reveals the entire revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And in another book again he tells you that this book was written before the foundation in the seals before the foundation of the world. He says, "Then your name was put." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your name was put there before the foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the book is revealed, your name is revealed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the name doesn't say a &gt;&gt; prophet says you only receive [Applause] [Music]
