[0:41] You know, God is not kept in a bag like
[0:44] this.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is in the bag, but God
[0:51] is in the heart.

[1:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother never said 77% of it.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:36] &gt;&gt; he says what was once in the mind of
[1:39] God.
[1:41] Then you read your spoken word is the
[1:44] original word
[1:46] &gt;&gt; where he where he says this is the
[1:49] secret
[1:50] &gt;&gt; the word
[1:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:53] &gt;&gt; is in the
[1:59] &gt;&gt; he never said a sermon
[2:03] &gt;&gt; because
[2:04] &gt;&gt; God is the way
[2:07] &gt;&gt; not amen
[2:10] Sometimes you hear nice say I was
[2:13] blessed today so so
[2:16] &gt;&gt; and the next day you are
[2:17] &gt;&gt; set
[2:21] you must receive the way

[2:29] &gt;&gt; so there was no man
[2:31] &gt;&gt; God will get amen
[2:35] the man is God's partner
[2:39] Amen.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; He will do something and send it to men
[2:43] &gt;&gt; to do the rest.

[3:02] &gt;&gt; And God said send one for Peter.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and Peter from Job.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's the other part of
[3:14] the other part. So he must have
[3:18] one thing and one reserve for
[3:21] &gt;&gt; now if you read in the Bible always God
[3:24] has never the Lord Jesus even brother
[3:27] says when he was on earth he didn't do
[3:30] all things
[3:33] &gt;&gt; because one part belongs to them.
[3:42] The hidden things are of the Lord but
[3:44] the reveal of men.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Now Adam has the the other part.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; God had to share with Adam.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Now he has created but he want somebody
[4:00] a man
[4:01] &gt;&gt; to come and do the rest.
[4:04] And there was no man.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; So, so he had to bring down the spirit
[4:09] into
[4:10] &gt;&gt; the body.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Sent.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; We have it.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Now we come back again.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Now with s
[4:31] &gt;&gt; not creation.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God said the Bible says there was
[4:36] no man to till the ground. Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; There was no man wasting
[4:41] &gt;&gt; you see always there is no man there is
[4:43] no man
[4:46] &gt;&gt; that means men plays an important role
[4:49] as
[4:50] [Music]
[4:52] &gt;&gt; because it's always there is no man
[4:55] &gt;&gt; there is no man
[4:56] &gt;&gt; so there is now no man worth there is a
[5:00] man but not a worthy man
[5:05] &gt;&gt; why because
[5:07] You read your
[5:09] [Music]
[5:11] who is this
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc?
[5:13] &gt;&gt; It says you bypass your
[5:15] &gt;&gt; theophedraise
[5:22] God. Amen. Because you can't test that
[5:24] the
[5:30] &gt;&gt; can you
[5:31] [Applause]
[5:34] &gt;&gt; now there was no men who because
[5:39] &gt;&gt; in the system of God
[5:42] &gt;&gt; that was the spirit
[5:44] in the form of rainbow and logos
[5:48] &gt;&gt; and amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[5:51] Now some people don't believe that Jesus
[5:53] Christ was our substitute.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; He stood in our place where we were
[5:59] supposed to be.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brennham says God
[6:06] required a kingsman.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; A substitute.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Read your kingsman redeemer tells you
[6:17] that God look for a substitute.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:20] [Applause]
[6:22] And God couldn't find a substitute
[6:24] anywhere. So he had to come himself
[6:29] &gt;&gt; and take a body and become our
[6:32] substitute.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; A substitute means he took our place
[6:39] &gt;&gt; and that's why says you know where there
[6:43] was
[6:44] he calls this thing he says after the
[6:46] fall
[6:48] &gt;&gt; then there was a gap.
[6:50] Yeah. Yes.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Adam left the place.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; So God sent
[7:00] &gt;&gt; he had no he was running around.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; He could only send God say to God
[7:07] send me
[7:11] &gt;&gt; you see. So now when he when he
[7:17] &gt;&gt; lost the place
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the prophet tells you that the
[7:21] Lord Jesus came because this he says
[7:24] this became time
[7:27] &gt;&gt; he says now that's why the Lord Jesus
[7:29] came and took the body of time
[7:33] [Music]
[7:35] &gt;&gt; to do what? To sprinkle this place with
[7:38] blood.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:43] [Applause]
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[8:01] &gt;&gt; now the was mad
[8:05] fall into time
[8:08] &gt;&gt; and then Adam where are you? Adam, he
[8:12] was still there.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; And God came down to the place because
[8:17] he cannot open up another place.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; God is a stronger.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[8:31] [Music]
[8:32] &gt;&gt; You know, I was so amazed and jumped
[8:35] with joy when when I did.

[9:12] do this. I can't do this. I can't do
[9:15] that." You'll be God.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[10:31] But since you don't have blood,
[10:35] &gt;&gt; that
[10:36] &gt;&gt; is the redeemed.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; But every age is a mercy seat.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Mercy seat.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Now here he says now for him to buy this

[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there was white
[11:55] &gt;&gt; now the white is within the pyramid
[11:59] &gt;&gt; where the prophet says
[12:03] he said to the people look in
[12:07] &gt;&gt; after Junior Jackson saw the prophet in
[12:10] a vision chopping off the top of that
[12:14] boulder there and inside within inside.
[12:18] That's how God
[12:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; because the the pyramid represents the
[12:23] church.

[12:25] &gt;&gt; We all know that seven steps to the
[12:28] king's ch.

[12:40] things they are here before.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; He says when it standard
[12:48] Hallelujah.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; He saw something.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Now, the mystery was not the thunders.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[12:59] &gt;&gt; the mystery was something he saw.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Then he says when he saw that thing, he
[13:11] looked for interpretation. Amen.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; He couldn't interpret it
[13:17] &gt;&gt; where it says the mystery is beneath the
[13:19] sea.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; The mystery is beneath the sea. So he
[13:24] couldn't interpret that.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; You want me to read it?
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Brother couldn't interpret this.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; The white stone
[13:36] &gt;&gt; which stands for the seventh se.
[13:40] It stands for the seven
[13:43] &gt;&gt; they couldn't inter
[13:47] &gt;&gt; within and there was no writing because
[13:51] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord was not on the
[13:53] letter form
[14:00] the mystery of God revealed. It says
[14:03] when John John was forbidden to write
[14:06] the
[14:09] history.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; So
[14:15] what God omitted there is the coming of
[14:18] the Lord.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; And as it says
[14:24] the prophet
[14:26] maybe I have a book here. If I don't
[14:28] have I will quote that.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says he he says
[14:34] here
[14:38] &gt;&gt; when God
[14:40] came to the seven he stopped there.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't go further said now I need a
[14:46] man.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; When he
[14:49] came to the seven
[14:52] &gt;&gt; he also
[14:55] stopped.
[14:56] [Music]
[15:00] that that is the thing that caused a lot
[15:03] of trouble.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Brother says God said nothing.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[15:10] &gt;&gt; that is very good.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; That's why the people don't know
[15:14] anything
[15:15] [Music]
[15:17] &gt;&gt; because God said
[15:18] &gt;&gt; nothing.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[15:22] If I
[15:25] going to uh
[15:27] maybe
[15:30] get into a
[15:33] conversation with you,
[15:36] &gt;&gt; uh verbally you hear what I'm saying.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; But if I omit something and keep it in
[15:44] my heart, then you don't hear.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Of course.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; So the only the only way you can hear it
[15:55] &gt;&gt; if
[15:56] if
[15:58] there's between me and you
[16:01] &gt;&gt; and a network
[16:06] &gt;&gt; that can take this from my heart to your
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Now brother says when God comes to men
[16:16] he comes to his heart.
[16:19] Amen.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; I mean the Bible but I must say brother
[16:24] say so that it can come closer.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible even speaks of the thoughts of
[16:32] the heart.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Because with this
[16:40] &gt;&gt; you come with evolution.
[16:43] [Music]
[16:44] written the Bible where it says firstly
[16:48] apostles.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; God gave to the church for
[16:54] firstly apostles.
[16:57] Then the brother said oh firstly

[18:19] &gt;&gt; He never said an apostle.

[18:25] &gt;&gt; And should God not send this man,
[18:29] &gt;&gt; both Gentiles and the Jews are lost.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Because that man
[18:40] &gt;&gt; is the spokesman of God
[18:44] &gt;&gt; for the last time.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; And it says if God don't
[18:51] &gt;&gt; the whole world

[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; It's quiet here. Is
[23:47] &gt;&gt; amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look to heaven, you don't see
[23:52] anything. You don't hear anything.
[23:55] [Music]
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Angels stop their
[23:59] &gt;&gt; HS.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Nothing going on
[24:04] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[24:06] [Music]
[24:10] &gt;&gt; You hear nothing in heaven.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; You see nothing. God has switched off.
[24:19] Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; So that no one can intercept.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; And then now if God wants to come to his
[24:28] throne
[24:30] &gt;&gt; which is the heart.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; He can't bodily come into the heart.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; What is coming in to the heart is is the
[24:39] sin that is in him.
[24:42] What was in Christ to us
[24:47] &gt;&gt; in Jesus
[24:51] &gt;&gt; the the holy of holies
[24:54] there was this box.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Of the covenant
[24:59] &gt;&gt; of the covenant
[25:00] &gt;&gt; which today stands for the soul of men
[25:04] &gt;&gt; which today stands for the heart of men.
[25:06] And now we see that that small box
[25:10] &gt;&gt; there. Now brother tells you now where
[25:12] they are today.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; In the heart.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all those things were
[25:19] without
[25:21] &gt;&gt; but now today they are in
[25:25] [Music]
[25:28] &gt;&gt; I don't waste my time going with camera
[25:31] looking for a pill.
[25:35] [Music]
[25:43] [Applause]
[25:48] When the children of God were looking
[25:50] around for another law to keep,
[25:54] &gt;&gt; God said, "Now, this is the new
[25:57] covenant.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put them in."
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; So, they used to keep the law
[26:05] &gt;&gt; and afterwards the law kept them.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; When it is in them, the Lord
[26:13] &gt;&gt; kept them. But when it is on the stone,
[26:16] they had to read from the stone.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody somebody drops three,
[26:24] somebody drops $30
[26:27] and an Israelite now is looking at the
[26:30] stone shall not.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; And now he thinks thinking
[26:39] the prison.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:44] Yeah.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; And there some ministers who stones
[26:48] ready to
[26:49] [Music]
[26:51] &gt;&gt; transgress the law.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; So now they they suffered under the law.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Because even if you you want to steal
[27:02] something, you look at the stone, it
[27:04] says thou shall not.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Now God said you have failed.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Now the thing I'm going to put inside
[27:13] Hallelujah.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Let us try to close
[27:21] here.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; There was no man to the ground. Let me
[27:26] read it quickly here and we w up here
[27:29] with Jews. The Jews what happened and
[27:32] what is happening right now.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; But this is the Gentiles
[27:37] &gt;&gt; with us the Gentiles. Now God came and
[27:42] brother repeats it. He says God said
[27:44] nothing about the seven.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Then he says he open a six and stop.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Now where he stopped it is because if
[27:56] now you read it in the Bible you come
[27:59] the white horse you are coming. You are
[28:01] coming that is just in your mind
[28:04] &gt;&gt; where it stops you stop.
[28:10] Are you not going further?
[28:12] &gt;&gt; No. It says there's nothing here.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Elijah said to his servant, "Go out,
[28:20] look to the sea." And there was nothing.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; He came back and said,
[28:26] &gt;&gt; "I see nothing."
[28:31] &gt;&gt; And Elijah said to him,
[28:37] My servant, you see nothing. There's
[28:39] nothing.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; But yet there was something.
[28:44] [Music]
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Now Elijah knew about the dimensions.
[28:53] Where a man would say there's nothing a
[28:57] prophet comes and say there
[28:59] [Music]
[29:00] [Applause]
[29:03] &gt;&gt; would say he said nothing
[29:07] will come and say something
[29:10] [Music]
[29:12] &gt;&gt; he said nothing in heaven but he said
[29:15] somethingmen
[29:17] [Applause]
[29:20] Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Because Satan how he operates
[29:25] &gt;&gt; he he's
[29:28] always waiting
[29:29] &gt;&gt; for to intercept. Yeah,
[29:34] &gt;&gt; something is there.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; God sends the two Ps
[29:42] &gt;&gt; and and God said to brother Bren,
[29:45] &gt;&gt; you know the two Ps,
[29:47] &gt;&gt; the first and the second,
[29:49] &gt;&gt; that's the devil's playground.
[29:51] [Music]
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Even today, I've seen the
[29:59] on DVD of some people there in Manoi.
[30:04] That man stood and said, "God spoke to
[30:07] me something here."
[30:09] &gt;&gt; He asked the minister.
[30:11] He gossip in the eye of the tears of the
[30:14] minister that I feel the Holy Ghost
[30:16] saying something
[30:20] &gt;&gt; and he comes before the audience and say
[30:22] h there's a woman here with stomach ache
[30:29] and 15 women came for
[30:34] 15
[30:36] now
[30:40] so I had pray for all the 15.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Hitting them with this and
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus

[31:02] I tell you one day won't allow me that
[31:05] they use black and white magic.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yes. Everybody wants to be a
[31:11] super man
[31:12] &gt;&gt; so that when he comes to church he can
[31:14] just say Jesus

[31:25] &gt;&gt; have you seen Ben
[31:28] people like pick him
[31:38] [Applause]

[33:13] stone mystery. Yeah.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; So he said to them, look into this and

[34:08] doubts. Yeah.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; They were just walking around along the
[34:18] D in the wall
[34:20] &gt;&gt; and looking and they were looking like
[34:23] inside

[35:14] &gt;&gt; This one is is looking at the image and
[35:24] &gt;&gt; now when we look at the white stone
[35:27] &gt;&gt; and the people wonder why we keep on
[35:31] looking
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:40] [Music]
[35:40] [Applause]
[35:41] We can see ourselves.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; John looked beyond.
[35:48] [Applause]
[35:50] Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And he said there's John
[35:57] in the church.
[36:01] [Applause]
[36:04] [Music]
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; John looking at John.
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Where
[36:20] Not in the church age.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Brother looked up one day and he said,
[36:26] "Who are you?"
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I see
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:33] [Music]
[36:39] sport of
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us is the word of
[36:49] God.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Let me start to look at
[36:55] [Music]
[36:56] I'm going to read where brother says he
[36:59] has a white stone and brother Brenham
[37:01] says you
[37:04] &gt;&gt; God has put a little stone in you.
[37:08] little white stone.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Then then he preach a message that
[37:15] we must be
[37:18] be magnetized
[37:20] &gt;&gt; to the stone.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; So you need to have that thing in you in
[37:27] order to magnetize
[37:31] &gt;&gt; now. Now I'm here. Listen, let me read
[37:34] it quickly. Uh now he saw some seven
[37:38] angels
[37:39] &gt;&gt; flying.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; And uh he says um
[37:46] it banging.
[37:48] All right. I know that it was them seven
[37:52] uttering themselves right close together
[37:55] just banging seven different times and
[37:57] it it unfolded into something.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now what we need to show the
[38:04] people is that something
[38:07] &gt;&gt; not the thunders because they have
[38:11] emptied
[38:12] &gt;&gt; themselves.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Now when he saw that he said he refused
[38:21] to say now I look for the interpretation
[38:24] that flow.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The interpretation that flew
[38:31] &gt;&gt; because
[38:33] seven seven angels of the earth
[38:35] interpreted the seven church
[38:39] &gt;&gt; but seven angels from heaven interpreted
[38:43] the white
[38:47] [Applause]
[38:50] &gt;&gt; so he saw seven angels coming from
[38:52] eternity
[38:53] &gt;&gt; with the interpretation of the wise
[38:59] the unwritten white
[39:03] [Music]
[39:05] have to do something.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:14] Because here you must have a writing.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; You remember that now? Now we have some
[39:26] readers
[39:28] &gt;&gt; the people who can whose ministry is
[39:32] just to
[39:32] &gt;&gt; leave
[39:35] &gt;&gt; but no manifestation.
[39:39] I can give you one clip of it. How the
[39:41] mages came into Jerusalem
[39:44] &gt;&gt; and they found the ministers there.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; You know, all men just
[39:55] &gt;&gt; and
[39:58] now they they went in and said,
[40:01] &gt;&gt; "Where is he?" Oh,
[40:04] &gt;&gt; okay.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[40:06] &gt;&gt; where is he?
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Because now they went through the
[40:12] reading
[40:14] &gt;&gt; dispensation
[40:15] &gt;&gt; time and now they were in another time.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; It's
[40:21] a
[40:25] scripture.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; They were coming for a man.
[40:38] You can run again and find Philip. How
[40:42] &gt;&gt; he rushed to his brother and said, "Come
[40:44] and see."
[40:46] &gt;&gt; The one whom Moses
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Now he's no longer a scripture.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:00] He used to be in the prophecy.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; But when the prophecy is fulfilled,
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; When the prophecy is fulfilled, it's
[41:10] amen.
[41:11] [Applause]
[41:15] &gt;&gt; John used to be Isaiah 4.
[41:19] When Isaiah 5 was fulfilled, it was
[41:23] [Applause]
[41:25] &gt;&gt; so you are a fulfillment
[41:29] &gt;&gt; of a scripture.
[41:32] [Music]
[41:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; I look for the interpretation.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And now he says now, now let's listen.
[41:46] Now hear this part.
[41:48] 76.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Now God was looking for a worthy man.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Who is worthy?
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; When he open he open
[42:01] a he he he drew out the mysteries out of
[42:05] himself
[42:07] &gt;&gt; because they were there in the holy of
[42:09] holies
[42:10] &gt;&gt; and in the temple of Jesus.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; God made sure that it should be that
[42:18] should be stored in a man
[42:20] &gt;&gt; who could not die.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; When he died, he said h demolish this
[42:28] temple
[42:29] &gt;&gt; but on the third day
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I will restore it again.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; So that's where he restored his
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now
[42:40] then we see that when the seventh was to
[42:45] be open which is the greatest of all the
[42:48] you can have
[42:52] &gt;&gt; amen. Some people read and say I've read
[42:54] about this and that is good but the
[42:57] seven
[43:00] &gt;&gt; that is that is our way out
[43:06] &gt;&gt; that is our reenter
[43:09] [Applause]
[43:12] &gt;&gt; a ministry without the ser
[43:16] is a closed ministry
[43:20] &gt;&gt; because brotherham says
[43:22] The seven seals book closes the Bible.
[43:29] [Music]
[43:30] &gt;&gt; So if you come with the Bible and preach
[43:33] it A to Z.
[43:37] [Music]
[43:42] [Applause]
[43:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you see the people are doing
[43:48] like a chicken after it had his Eight
[43:52] neck cut off.
[43:58] [Music]
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Ministry without
[44:12] [Applause]
[44:19] &gt;&gt; forgive me. Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes my shirt misbehave
[44:27] &gt;&gt; brothers let's now brother Benham says
[44:31] the reason
[44:33] &gt;&gt; now when they he could not interpret he
[44:36] went westward
[44:38] [Music]
[44:39] &gt;&gt; amen
[44:40] &gt;&gt; to connect
[44:41] &gt;&gt; with the angels message
[44:44] &gt;&gt; because says when the seal is open it
[44:48] opens a new ministry.
[44:53] The ministry now is the seven seal
[44:58] &gt;&gt; because that is Christ.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; So now he says, let me read it now. You
[45:06] know it. I just read for to keep time.
[45:08] The reason I had to go was to connect
[45:11] with this angel's message to come back
[45:13] here to reveal it to the church.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. with you.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; The thing is
[45:26] as
[45:29] it says here
[45:31] now, brother Brillam says, I came to
[45:33] reveal it to the church.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Who revealed it? Now
[45:42] &gt;&gt; fear not to say
[45:46] &gt;&gt; but I will ask how. Yeah.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. The level. But
[45:58] &gt;&gt; how did he do it?
[46:02] [Music]
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Here's your book here.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; The people the reason they couldn't see
[46:10] him,
[46:11] &gt;&gt; they stood the man.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; They come to see God and they see a man.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. page 17 of your the unveiling of
[46:20] God.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; They they come to see God.

[46:24] &gt;&gt; And they say
[46:27] &gt;&gt; amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; He says this is what blinded them.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; And he says again page 34.
[46:35] Page 34 is the same thing again. He says
[46:39] the gentile church has also been blinded
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] &gt;&gt; from the veil
[46:46] &gt;&gt; after it's been tore off and show it
[46:49] show God
[46:51] &gt;&gt; the atlast the the atlesiestical veil
[46:56] how
[46:57] &gt;&gt; by veiling the word in human being again
[47:03] &gt;&gt; amen because he says now that the the
[47:07] son of men is after the seven church
[47:10] ages.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; He says the son of man is revealed back
[47:14] to the church
[47:17] of God.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; No,
[47:19] &gt;&gt; which is the holy ghost.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; What the the way what the spirit says to
[47:24] the churches.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But now after that is the because if you
[47:29] come to the seven church age
[47:33] &gt;&gt; it's where it says
[47:35] grief not the holy spirit.
[47:37] You have seen until
[47:40] &gt;&gt; now until the day of redemption we see
[47:43] the sins.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; People are being selected and set aside
[47:50] as overcomers.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; So you are s
[47:56] of redemp now the day of redemption it
[47:58] says is the day that book is open.
[48:01] [Applause]
[48:04] Then you are redeemed out of the book
[48:07] &gt;&gt; as he said to Daniel.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Close the book until the end time and
[48:12] your people shall be saved.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Everybody that shall be found written.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Can I close?
[48:27] I said in Malawi, sorry for keeping you
[48:31] long. Then they said, "No, here we've
[48:34] got eternal life."
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; So scared.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; They wanted me to preach for the rest of
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[48:53] The reason I went west, you know, we
[48:56] have west and east and west. So says
[48:59] east and west has come together
[49:02] &gt;&gt; because it's the eastern people and the
[49:04] western people that is the Jews and the
[49:06] the gentiles. Now he went west
[49:09] in order to connect with this angel's
[49:12] message to come back here to reveal it
[49:15] to the church because I can read some
[49:18] scriptures places here
[49:21] where it says when he left the
[49:24] intercessory box and then h when the
[49:28] intercessory box is over the church ages
[49:31] have done finished up he come in
[49:36] this age. He he takes the book of seals,
[49:40] the book of seals or a book sealed with
[49:43] seven seals, break them and shows the
[49:47] &gt;&gt; them h to
[49:51] pardon me, pardon me. And shows them
[49:55] look at the end of the age now.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; He shows them he shows them to the
[49:59] seventh angel because it was the seventh
[50:02] angel.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. was the seventh man. He erected
[50:08] the the pyramid but the one who
[50:12] interpreted it was brother.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; It will be silent.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. Now h I connected with the
[50:23] message of this angel now.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't interpret.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; So now he must connect with the angel
[50:32] that angel in order to come. Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And reveal.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Then he says with this angel's message
[50:40] to come back here.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; To reveal it to the church.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; You remember I said the next thing
[50:50] things that will happen will be here at
[50:53] the church.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Not to the world.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; But they are going to one place. Yes,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Elijah was sent to pick up Elishah.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; But there were some churches built
[51:09] around that.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; But he came for Elijah.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; You know, you you plant your
[51:22] weed.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; There will be some churches around
[51:35] And the name is almost the same.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; If you ask them who are we?
[51:44] So if you didn't listen
[51:49] [Applause]
[51:52] [Music]
[51:56] when when he goes to water is to water
[52:00] the wheat.
[52:04] But now because they are now
[52:07] they build around the
[52:10] &gt;&gt; so they also receive
[52:13] &gt;&gt; water
[52:17] &gt;&gt; but they think they will outshine the
[52:19] wind.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Then the next thing
[52:26] comes to
[52:34] [Music]
