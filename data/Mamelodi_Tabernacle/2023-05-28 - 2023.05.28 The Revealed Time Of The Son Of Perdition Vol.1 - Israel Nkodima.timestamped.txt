[22:16] that will be it's the same scripture
[22:20] Genesis 19 27 to 28. it's about my
[22:28] mother's 19 27 28
[22:32] and Abraham got up early in the morning
[22:35] to the place where he stood before the
[22:38] Lord and he looked towards Sodom and
[22:41] Gomorrah and toward all the land of the
[22:43] plane and beheld and low the smoke of
[22:46] the country went up as the smoke of a
[22:49] furnace

[23:07] and
[23:11] okay let's leave it there for a while we

[23:37] but let me just say Eric
[23:41] since you know you will we won't belong
[23:48] but looking from the place
[23:55] you look at the
[23:58] you know
[23:59] Abraham
[24:01] and his seed yeah
[24:07] you remember how
[24:10] even live by Pink tits in Abraham Island

[24:23] Seed lipping of Abraham
[24:29] no drowning God showed him
[24:34] foreign
[24:39] which is typed here if you
[24:44] look at the time of
[24:49] the time of
[24:50] Abraham
[24:52] today our time today where are we what
[24:55] are we facing now which day are we
[24:58] facing
[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] now if God at that time showed Abraham
[25:11] at that time because now our time also
[25:16] here has arrived
[25:22] and
[25:24] wherever this Abraham there's the
[25:28] seeds Abraham
[25:42] is your faith
[25:45] If Abraham was promised
[25:48] amen
[25:59] If Abraham saws
[26:07] what about the seed now
[26:11] because
[26:13] here is the Seed of Abraham right now
[26:18] and the tribulation period is coming
[26:25] all right amen
[26:27] now
[26:28] I'll take this
[26:30] in this
[26:32] spiritual manner
[26:36] what about today
[26:38] [Music]
[26:39] because the tribulation that is coming
[26:45] was typed there is
[26:50] [Music]
[26:52] but
[26:54] there's one thing that God said in the
[26:58] in his words
[27:01] when he said before really
[27:07] Abraham
[27:09] saw that day
[27:13] sort of Sodom Corps
[27:17] are we together amen
[27:19] amen God said shall I hide from Abraham
[27:31] that is verse
[27:34] Genesis chapter 18 verse 17 yeah just
[27:38] read that part
[27:40] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[27:43] Abraham that thing which I do
[27:46] that that is before
[27:48] is that before he saw Yes
[27:54] I mean
[27:57] that that's that's what that's what he
[27:59] was going to do I mean I understand he
[28:03] said shall I hide from Abraham Abraham
[28:07] the thing which I do
[28:11] no he could not
[28:18] the Lord Jesus himself
[28:22] he he
[28:24] took not the form of Ages
[28:36] if then at that time
[28:40] he showed he showed Abraham
[28:46] and in this last days
[28:51] there is this Seed of Abraham Abraham
[28:56] which before something happens
[29:01] Before Destruction strikes the world
[29:08] he will
[29:09] show to he will
[29:12] show today

[29:49] God knowing all this
[29:53] up to even this morning
[29:56] and even the coming days
[30:06] in his mind
[30:09] he had a plan
[30:12] and now last we read we have read from
[30:15] this
[30:18] Abraham
[30:20] knew very well
[30:22] that he could not
[30:25] see uh
[30:28] from where he was
[30:33] to to to to take uh to go to the place
[30:41] the Bible says
[30:43] [Music]

[30:56] she said go together
[31:01] that was before
[31:04] who's that man
[31:09] before Pharaoh arrives

[35:04] John says
[35:08] Cody John chapter 4.
[35:13] revelation 4.
[35:17] Revelation chapter 4.
[35:23] verse one one two two after this I
[35:27] looked and behold a door was open in
[35:30] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[35:33] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[35:36] me which said come up hither and I will
[35:39] show the things which must be here after
[35:41] amen right amen
[35:46] I will show you things which must be
[35:49] here really after okay
[36:02] Church ages
[36:05] I don't know if you have seen that
[36:07] that's why we are no longer in the
[36:09] church
[36:12] because coward is a thing of the paste
[36:27] you can see it from there
[36:29] you must come to the place
[36:32] where you'll be able to see
[36:35] what comes
[36:44] you also have seen it
[36:48] the ministry is a Ministry after the
[36:52] church
[36:57] not during the church
[36:59] that is
[37:02] [Music]
[37:03] now I will take it from here for a few
[37:06] minutes
[37:08] and then now we are going to at the End
[37:12] of Time
[37:14] the people living
[37:16] in the end times
[37:19] the bride of Christ the children of God
[38:00] takes about time
[38:04] now
[38:11] [Music]
[38:36] [Music]
[38:38] now the message that we is operating
[38:42] in the bride of Christ is a message from
[38:46] before
[38:51] let me quote you something here
[38:54] [Music]
[39:00] in DC
[39:02] sorry for my books things sticking out
[39:06] and you know I'm busy reading these
[39:10] books all right let me quote you
[39:13] something
[39:24] the old battle that started way back
[39:30] Beyond Time yeah
[39:35] yeah
[39:37] this is something that buffers buffers
[39:41] not to read the pride of Grace
[39:45] okay
[39:47] [Music]
[39:49] have you ever heard you now
[39:51] and
[40:05] that means
[40:06] if maybe we have
[40:10] taught on that
[40:13] or we have preached
[40:17] it
[40:17] hasn't yet find it
[40:23] foreign
[40:57] and you are now arriving
[41:01] on this spot
[41:05] after the the opening of the series
[41:09] You Came From Beyond time
[41:12] now coming through the church
[41:18] but after the church
[41:21] it puts you now
[41:27] [Music]
[41:29] now it puts you beyond time in the
[41:32] church ages
[41:36] but what the prophet says
[41:41] that started
[41:44] before times
[41:48] foreign
[42:16] amen
[42:22] where are we there together more
[42:26] from Beyond Time
[42:31] amen so we went through
[42:34] amen amen
[42:37] that's why the message is not the
[42:41] seventh Church ages
[42:50] now the battle started way back Beyond
[42:53] Time backwards
[42:57] Before Time
[43:00] begins then
[43:04] Satan and his angels were kicked out
[43:09] they come to the earth
[43:12] and the battle set in again
[43:18] I'll show you why the people can't see
[43:21] this battle of armagedia
[43:24] because he started
[43:32] men cannot see that
[43:36] if he was not there
[43:40] Beyond time
[43:43] let's take it like this
[43:47] let me finish
[43:50] foreign
[44:29] uh the Bible doesn't say
[44:32] Michael killed them
[44:36] no I he says he he overcome them
[44:42] and send them
[44:46] down to the Earth
[44:49] he didn't kill them
[44:52] and then so they continue because that
[44:56] is their nature
[45:01] so they started again
[45:04] to continue
[45:10] now I think you will see this
[45:16] now when the the battle started here on
[45:20] Earth
[45:21] it was not by some other people
[45:26] by the same people never
[45:42] we are still those people
[45:51] why the people cannot see this battle
[45:54] foreign
[46:20] foreign
[46:52] foreign
[47:14] amen but what is Mystery is say healing
[47:18] stupa
[47:19] uh you won't even understand
[47:24] when talking about the battle of
[47:26] Armageddon
[47:28] again
[47:31] you have part of it
[47:37] is that right
[47:39] let me finish reading
[47:42] uh because I
[47:45] I I have planned not to stand for a long
[47:49] time
[47:52] the old battle that started way back
[48:01] and Satan and his Angel was
[48:05] were kicked out
[48:08] and then they come to the earth and the
[48:12] battle set in again
[48:35] okay
[48:48] now usually uh that's why
[48:53] uh if the battle started in the mind
[48:59] that means
[49:01] only those who are registered
[49:05] as the army
[49:09] they know they will they will know about
[49:12] this battle of form again
[49:17] but they were registered already
[49:23] now the reason even now
[49:29] they will be there will be no answer
[49:32] because
[49:34] because
[49:49] and Satan and his angels were
[49:52] kicked out
[49:55] and they come to the Earth
[49:58] the battle set in again
[50:02] and then they come all right and the
[50:06] battles sit in a gate because
[50:10] if
[50:12] broke down the barrier ever

[1:17:53] wonderful things are happening now
[1:17:58] okay let's let's read it again
[1:18:01] and it was the theophany of God
[1:18:06] and the out of the logos
[1:18:15] and
[1:18:16] so you were a CEO Fighters
[1:18:20] if you are understanding now let me
[1:18:23] reach
[1:18:24] and it was the theophany of God that
[1:18:27] went out
[1:18:34] what God
[1:18:36] we have read that one
[1:18:39] what God makes or or
[1:18:46] what happens what do you have
[1:18:52] what God makes is off
[1:18:56] oh God
[1:19:02] yeah amen
[1:19:05] if God
[1:19:12] it's something else Jesus that's why
[1:19:15] you you were not created
[1:19:18] but your body was created
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:24] now what came forth out of God
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:34] and that's why he says
[1:19:37] you have eternal life
[1:19:40] just like God
[1:19:42] and then he says
[1:19:46] came from the same place
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:51] hey if only you could see I'm
[1:19:57] okay
[1:19:59] can you see yourself
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:04] I I read I continue
[1:20:08] let us not again and it was the
[1:20:10] theophany of God that went out
[1:20:14] the human form in
[1:20:18] it that didn't have eyes like you see
[1:20:23] but a better eyes
[1:20:38] and that all these rainbows
[1:20:45] condescended into a field foreign
[1:21:18] I'm in
[1:21:21] you see what what what's actually is men
[1:21:25] now
[1:21:27] that's why the Bible says what is
[1:21:35] and all that was God
[1:21:40] oh that God
[1:21:42] thought of chocolate
[1:21:44] all that God made it
[1:21:50] was to make a man in his own
[1:21:54] um
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:04] there is
[1:22:05] the one that is created
[1:22:08] is your body give me
[1:22:13] that's right
[1:22:15] that's why we are not the same others
[1:22:23] creation
[1:22:25] yeah amen
[1:22:30] we are not the same
[1:22:34] huh amen
[1:22:37] creation Motorola
[1:22:39] one one is angry
[1:22:42] one doesn't love that one um
[1:22:49] that's why it says
[1:22:54] that was created
[1:23:01] oh man
[1:23:03] yeah
[1:23:05] when we came in those times at the back
[1:23:08] there
[1:23:09] I found them singing saying yeah
[1:23:27] let me reach
[1:23:31] the rainbow
[1:23:34] because
[1:23:35] it is God
[1:23:39] was looked at as a rainbow
[1:23:45] we have read that everybody
[1:23:47] so now actually but as brother Brendan
[1:23:52] says
[1:23:57] into
[1:24:00] a few friends
[1:24:05] and out of God
[1:24:11] foreign
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:48] food
[1:24:50] that's right
[1:24:52] we have the seven
[1:24:55] series
[1:24:59] if if you are still in a church age
[1:25:08] okay
[1:25:10] you can see outside
[1:25:15] from the church
[1:25:21] um
[1:25:23] and I will show you
[1:25:28] because the real side that God is
[1:25:32] responsible
[1:25:35] is when he shows you things to come here
[1:25:43] that's the side that you need okay okay
[1:25:47] to see things
[1:25:50] to come
[1:25:52] that's why Abraham Abraham would not see
[1:25:56] it
[1:25:57] while the Lord has told him that
[1:26:01] what he's going to do
[1:26:17] I mean
[1:26:19] possibly he said to the wife
[1:26:23] let me go and check
[1:26:26] I think time has arrived
[1:26:29] that's the thing that God has done
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:37] that it is happening
[1:26:40] now let me just go back
[1:26:43] to the place
[1:26:46] amen amen Where I Stood before the Lord
[1:26:51] it was a special place
[1:26:54] just like the special place
[1:26:59] coming back to the end time to I mean to
[1:27:03] the ministry
[1:27:13] for special people
[1:27:18] you listen now no I mean you here
[1:27:21] Abraham Abraham it was not somebody or
[1:27:25] God never said all right go back there
[1:27:27] no
[1:27:31] that one that thing was already in him
[1:27:39] that's why we came from the denomination
[1:27:43] who told us
[1:27:45] it's something in US
[1:27:50] because we didn't belong there
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:55] amen amen okay
[1:27:58] as they think there is a big will
[1:28:00] turning in mind in my heart yeah
[1:28:06] I'm looking here to
[1:28:10] all right amen
[1:28:13] Abram saw
[1:28:15] him when he stepped down into human
[1:28:19] flesh
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:21] um
[1:28:28] when Abraham was standing there hey
[1:28:32] he saw
[1:28:34] hello
[1:28:37] hello
[1:28:39] then he saw
[1:28:42] those that light coming down
[1:28:49] now that's why the prophet says
[1:28:52] he saw him coming
[1:28:55] into the body
[1:29:03] so
[1:29:05] Abram Abraham could have said to his
[1:29:08] wife because
[1:29:12] Sarah was just as predestinated as
[1:29:16] Abraham Abraham
[1:29:23] that was something
[1:29:25] both predestinated
[1:29:31] just to show Christ
[1:29:37] they came from the same place
[1:29:42] Christ and the bridge
[1:29:45] so we will come we are coming to that
[1:29:49] how their marriage is going to be like
[1:29:54] okay wait for us
[1:29:57] and we will come to the to the marriage
[1:30:05] okay I read another scripture says
[1:30:11] the Seed of Abraham they started off
[1:30:17] looking for their promises
[1:30:22] and they saw it a pharaoh
[1:30:29] now they started working towards that
[1:30:33] the Bible says they saw it
[1:30:39] just like us
[1:30:42] all right now let's look at this
[1:30:48] the rainbow condescended into a
[1:30:51] theophile
[1:30:54] and God Made You Bet Your fight
[1:31:01] like the revelation of the Seven Seas
[1:31:06] it's not something you uh you are
[1:31:09] struggling from
[1:31:11] asking that one
[1:31:15] do you believe that a series
[1:31:18] do you believe that the seven series
[1:31:22] because the seals we thought the seven
[1:31:25] is incomplete
[1:31:30] but we will come to look into it why God
[1:31:34] omitted
[1:31:40] amen amen
[1:31:43] but we'll come and see
[1:31:47] all right
[1:31:49] now I'm trying to I'm I'm down coming
[1:31:54] with something here
[1:31:56] The Rainbow
[1:31:59] condescended into a theophy
[1:32:06] no that's why
[1:32:09] it does is it doesn't say I feel funny
[1:32:26] you know that what happened with you
[1:32:29] congratulations
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:38] otherwise you'd be saying that is not
[1:32:42] revealed
[1:32:44] unless it condescended
[1:32:48] into you then it becomes just a human
[1:32:52] thing
[1:32:54] you'll be going around asking
[1:33:00] now what are you saying in your church
[1:33:03] is it revealed
[1:33:07] says
[1:33:12] it's not something
[1:33:18] what are you saying
[1:33:23] that that's how God anointed that how
[1:33:27] the anointing was
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:35] seven colors of rainbows
[1:33:45] your family
[1:33:47] you get whatever
[1:33:59] no our
[1:34:01] this is what happened into the bread of
[1:34:03] Christ
[1:34:07] all that God was
[1:34:21] Christian
[1:34:27] that is the real anointing
[1:34:32] he himself
[1:34:40] all that God was
[1:34:44] we have read that last time
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:56] if you can't believe that
[1:34:59] yeah I don't know all right amen I'm
[1:35:02] carrying one for a few minutes
[1:35:05] yeah may the Lord bless you
[1:35:10] hey I I believe
[1:35:13] I've already seen
[1:35:15] things here
[1:35:18] and I believe
[1:35:20] we are going to see things
[1:35:25] we've got it
[1:35:27] line up
[1:35:30] all right amen let me finish
[1:35:34] and
[1:35:36] the rainbow
[1:35:38] condescended
[1:35:43] now you know how that's how the
[1:35:47] anointing was like
[1:35:54] this it was not that we are going to the
[1:35:56] upper room to wait for the Holy Ghost
[1:35:58] and so forth
[1:36:02] foreign
[1:36:32] you're funny
[1:36:36] that was the anointing
[1:36:39] is
[1:36:41] very same
[1:36:44] rainbow you are not a rainbow yeah
[1:36:52] Moses saw it
[1:36:58] when
[1:37:02] so it when it passed through
[1:37:06] the rocks
[1:37:14] said it
[1:37:16] it looked like a man
[1:37:18] is
[1:37:24] now unlike you know issue talking about
[1:37:27] the baptism of the Holy ghosts
[1:37:32] the this one what happened there
[1:37:35] before there was any Genesis
[1:37:38] all right amen then it continues Moses
[1:37:43] saw it
[1:37:44] it looked like a man
[1:37:48] you know that form
[1:37:50] s
[1:37:53] and
[1:37:54] Abraham Abraham saw him
[1:37:57] um when
[1:38:00] he stepped into human form
[1:38:08] all right amen that's how I I see the
[1:38:12] message
[1:38:17] and
[1:38:18] you can pick up the man to be the
[1:38:21] seventh angel messenger
[1:38:26] unless you saw something
[1:38:31] foreign
[1:38:55] oh
[1:38:56] just like you
[1:39:01] can show you yeah
[1:39:05] it will happen to you the same way John
[1:39:08] was standing there
[1:39:12] he knew that he was supposed to
[1:39:13] introduce the Messiah
[1:39:19] he just stood today
[1:39:22] but he heard he knew
[1:39:25] he's going to introduce
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:29] just as you know that
[1:39:32] we are going in the rapture
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:50] he's going to introduce the Messiah
[1:39:56] then he just stood there
[1:39:59] because he couldn't go to Bible School
[1:40:07] foreign it then he saw me are born
[1:40:13] which started as like a dove yeah
[1:40:19] and John started to follow him away
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:33] that's why how he introduced himself to
[1:40:37] you
[1:40:40] it was the logos
[1:40:45] in the beginning was
[1:40:49] that is the beginning
[1:40:51] I'm going back
[1:40:54] before the beginning really harm at all
[1:40:56] the beginning is introduced by Genesis
[1:41:04] of the beginning
[1:41:06] of Genesis
[1:41:15] before the beginning
[1:41:19] how was it before the beginning
[1:41:28] seven colors of the rainbow of the
[1:41:30] rainbow amen
[1:41:37] yeah all right amen but the thing is
[1:41:46] when when time has set in
[1:41:51] then you couldn't see that you're fine
[1:41:59] a
[1:42:01] he came up the beginning
[1:42:05] because God had in his mind
[1:42:14] for their life time
[1:42:20] yeah
[1:42:22] then he calls it in the beginning
[1:42:26] because now this is the end of the
[1:42:29] beginning
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:33] in the beginning God created
[1:42:39] and everything that was created
[1:42:45] yeah
[1:42:47] I'm also created by God yes but the
[1:42:51] creation
[1:42:55] continuity
[1:42:58] creation creation everything is
[1:43:18] but what was created
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:26] all right yes that's why we are still
[1:43:29] continuing
[1:43:30] because we were not created at all the
[1:43:34] person that is continuing now
[1:43:36] is the one that was not created
[1:43:39] [Applause]
[1:43:47] because we are not through we are coming
[1:43:53] all right I mean there is some something
[1:43:56] here what else is
