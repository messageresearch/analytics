[22:44] that reminds us of the day when
[22:47] your children were gathered before thee
[22:52] long before the foundation of the world
[22:55] it was a time gracious
[22:58] heavenly father
[23:00] in that gathering there was an uninvited
[23:03] guest
[23:04] and you asked the uninvited guests that

[44:33] the prayer requests have been brought to
[44:35] your attention
[44:36] we know even your father in the olden
[44:38] days there was a sick child too
[44:41] whereby people thought
[44:43] that parents had sinned that's why you
[44:45] were punishing the child
[44:48] but you said no no
[44:57] it's the same thing this morning
[45:00] we still throw the same strength we have
[45:02] given unto them then
[45:05] you are a good god again this morning

[45:11] unto you
[45:13] their new heavenly father before the
[45:14] foundation of the world that all has
[45:16] been given unto them

[46:04] teaches us that we have done everything
[46:06] before the foundation of the world
[46:09] if the lamb was slain before the
[46:10] foundation of the world
[46:12] and our sins were forgiven before before
[46:14] the foundation of the weather even the

[46:19] we were healed before the foundation of
[46:21] this weather

[46:24] manifestation because 2000 years back
[46:27] was the manifestation at the cross

[46:54] week praying for the people may you hear
[46:56] them lord in the name of our lord jesus
[46:58] christ

[47:18] an angel of the church will be standing
[47:20] behind the pulpit this morning
[47:31] [Music]
[47:43] when you incarnate yourself in him
[47:46] may you incarnate yourself amongst us so
[47:49] that when he's speaking is the deep
[47:50] calling to the team
[47:52] now level of
[47:58] there were many reasons for us not to be
[48:00] here this morning but we find ourselves
[48:03] here because we know it's a better place
[48:07] may you come and speak to us again in a
[48:09] special way
[48:10] so that we may praise your name wherever
[48:13] we are as i put all unto your capable
[48:15] hand in the mighty name of follow jesus
[48:17] christ amen
[48:19] [Applause]
[48:27] god bless you
[48:31] petitions were brought also last week
[48:36] and the elders prayed over them
[48:40] so the believers have brought
[48:42] thanksgiving
[48:44] that they have
[48:56] they bring thanksgiving to say the lord
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:06] we have a baptism
[49:10] finally rather benedict texting
[49:15] and also canali the daughter of pranam
[49:18] swan
[49:20] if they can just end the year for
[49:23] baptism
[49:33] god bless you
[49:35] welcome to the arm of the lord
[49:44] there are two thanksgiving that i want
[49:46] to read one is from sabine
[49:49] it says we would like to take this
[49:51] opportunity to thank pastor guadima
[49:54] and bradam keizer and the elders for the
[49:57] prayer they offered unto us
[50:00] when we were down with covet 19 which
[50:03] came in as a bad flu
[50:06] and we are completely healed from the
[50:09] pandemic of the dead
[50:12] the name of the lord jesus christ be
[50:14] placed
[50:15] there's power of healing in this
[50:17] ministry
[50:19] amen
[50:26] there's one also from pumula family
[50:30] it says
[50:32] family is thanking the lord for the
[50:35] baptism of uber
[50:37] um
[50:51] took place
[50:52] on thursday i believe brothers
[50:56] here
[50:58] you can stand my brother so that i can
[51:00] see you
[51:00] god bless you
[51:04] amen amen
[51:09] i just want to remind you all about
[51:12] covet 19 rules
[51:15] that we have to wear our mask
[51:20] all the time
[51:24] covering the nose and the mouth
[51:27] alleluia
[51:30] it is a request
[51:35] secondly
[51:38] the elders and the deacons
[51:41] they compiled a list
[51:44] for
[51:46] attendance on sunday
[51:49] we normally release that list on
[51:51] saturday morning
[51:54] again we appeal to the believers to
[51:56] communicate
[51:58] with their local deacons and the elders
[52:02] we also appear that you take time to
[52:04] check the list
[52:06] if you are not going to be available
[52:09] please inform
[52:11] the difference
[52:13] if you have symptoms please inform the
[52:16] deacons
[52:21] unfortunately we can only accommodate
[52:24] 410
[52:25] in this tabernacle
[52:29] so
[52:30] we try by all means to
[52:34] accommodate
[52:37] the visitors
[52:40] the newly baptized
[52:43] we try to accommodate them by all means
[52:46] but you need to communicate with us in
[52:48] advance
[52:52] amen may the lord richly bless you
[52:57] if
[52:58] you are not on the list
[53:01] it becomes a challenge because we only
[53:03] reserve one and ten
[53:05] seats
[53:07] so it becomes difficult to put extra
[53:10] chests because it means
[53:12] we are no longer going to have
[53:16] social distance
[53:20] as the pastor says
[53:22] this pandemic will pass
