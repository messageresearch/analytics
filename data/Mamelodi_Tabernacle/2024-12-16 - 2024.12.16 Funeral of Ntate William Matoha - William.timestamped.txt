[54:07] live and believe in
[54:10] me shall never
[54:13] die beli thou
[54:17] this you may take your
[54:21] seats I want to title my message this
[54:25] morning
[54:31] death is only a change of a Dwelling
[54:41] Place death is
[54:44] only a change of a dwelling
[54:51] place and I just want to read few script
[55:01] scriptures just to show you
[55:05] that we change Dwelling
[55:13] Places before you came here on the
[55:21] earth you were an attribute in God
[55:27] and I'm going to read Ephesians chapter
[55:31] 1 and it says according as he has chosen
[55:35] Us in
[55:39] him so that means we lived somewhere
[55:45] before he has chosen
[55:49] us him before the foundation of the
[55:52] world
[55:56] that
[55:57] means before God made the heavens and
[56:01] the
[56:05] Earth before this missile was
[56:10] formed we were in
[56:12] him we
[56:14] wereb we lived in
[56:17] him chose us in
[56:20] him then he brought us to the
[56:23] Earth he made the garden of Ed
[56:29] and from the dust of
[56:33] the he formed a
[56:36] man for he
[56:39] said let us make man in our own
[56:44] image so when God said let
[56:49] us he was speaking to
[56:52] us but we were in
[56:54] him so it was time to change the
[56:58] dwelling
[57:01] place let us make man in our
[57:05] own and the Bible says he made man in
[57:10] his own
[57:12] image and he formed Man Out of the Dust
[57:16] of the
[57:18] earth body that we are living
[57:23] in is a body that was made from the Dust
[57:26] of
[57:29] the our initialing
[57:34] place not this
[57:36] body but God is a
[57:39] spirit and that means we were also the
[57:42] spirit in
[57:44] him so God is a spirit with the capital
[57:47] letter
[57:49] s but we are referred to as the spirit
[58:00] so God was speaking to
[58:02] us but we were in
[58:05] him aing
[58:10] place there was a time that job was
[58:15] troubled after the
[58:18] trials during the
[58:21] trials then
[58:23] God visited

[59:17] him where were
[59:19] you sons of God were
[59:23] shouting when job remembered
[59:27] that he was in
[59:29] him when we are here on
[59:33] the we don't
[59:35] remember our
[59:38] initial but God visit each one of
[59:43] us of the Lord Jesus
[59:47] Christ we can know our next delling
[59:52] place God first brings you
[59:59] where you come
[1:00:02] from when a woman gives birth to the
[1:00:09] child when the child
[1:00:11] grow a child do not
[1:00:15] remember that she he or she was in the
[1:00:19] mother's
[1:00:21] room how many can stand and testify
[1:00:34] so God brings us to a
[1:00:36] remembrance our dwelling
[1:00:40] place now allow me to read the book of
[1:00:48] Luke and Luke chapter
[1:00:51] 16 Luke chapter
[1:00:54] 16 just to show you about The Dwelling
[1:01:01] Places death only change
[1:01:08] youring death do not
[1:01:15] change only God
[1:01:20] CH here on the
[1:01:22] earth death only change your Dwelling
[1:01:25] Place
[1:01:29] The Book of Luke
[1:01:31] says
[1:01:36] L2 and it came to
[1:01:50] pass I believe you want to
[1:01:53] assist may the Lord richly bless you
[1:01:58] The Book of Luke 16
[1:02:02] says and it came to
[1:02:06] pass that the Begg
[1:02:09] died and was carried by the Angels into
[1:02:12] Abraham's
[1:02:17] BOS the rich man also
[1:02:21] died and was
[1:02:23] buried you see when the Beg
[1:02:29] dieded by the
[1:02:33] Angels but this rich
[1:02:36] man when he
[1:02:38] died the Bible says he was
[1:02:43] buried and in h he lifted up his
[1:02:48] eyes see this rich man was not a
[1:02:53] Believer he didn't believe the go
[1:02:56] gospel so he died a
[1:02:59] sinner so he was
[1:03:01] buried when he the Bible says and inhale
[1:03:06] he lift up his
[1:03:09] eyes being in
[1:03:12] torment so this one was not a
[1:03:17] Believer death brought
[1:03:20] him to a Dwelling
[1:03:23] Place which was hell
[1:03:27] so when he lifted up his
[1:03:33] eyes now it continue and
[1:03:38] says and see
[1:03:49] Abraham now in those
[1:03:52] days we had Paradise
[1:04:00] they were in the same
[1:04:05] Dimension but they were divided by a
[1:04:09] Gul and they were able to see one
[1:04:13] another but the one that was in
[1:04:16] Hell could not cross into
[1:04:21] Paradise but could see what was
[1:04:24] happening in Paradise
[1:04:37] inor but there was a between
[1:04:41] them but remember in the Old
[1:04:48] Testament it was under the blood of
[1:04:51] animal
[1:04:56] they were not washed by the blood of the
[1:05:01] Lamb the blood of
[1:05:05] animals a
[1:05:09] sacrifice not remove the desire of
[1:05:13] sin but the blood of Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ sanctify
[1:05:21] you justify you and remove
[1:05:26] even the desire
[1:05:29] of gives you part of
[1:05:35] himself so in in
[1:05:38] Paradise they only went because they
[1:05:41] believed the
[1:05:43] message goel that was
[1:05:46] preached but their sins were not fully
[1:05:52] washed so that's why it was Paradise
[1:05:58] but after the death and the resurrection
[1:06:01] of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:04] Christ When They Crucified the Lord
[1:06:07] Jesus
[1:06:08] Christ now he went
[1:06:11] down to Hell and took the keys from
[1:06:17] Satan the keys of hell and
[1:06:20] death because people were tormented by
[1:06:23] Death
[1:06:25] then when he after he took the
[1:06:29] keys now he moved
[1:06:32] paradise and I want us to look at how he
[1:06:35] changed the dwelling
[1:06:39] place I want us to go to the Book of
[1:06:43] Psalms Psalms
[1:06:46] 24 2 and look at how he removed them
[1:06:50] from
[1:06:53] Paradise I'm going to read from vers
[1:06:58] s in
[1:07:01] Paradise when you die in old
[1:07:04] man
[1:07:06] inise will remain an old
[1:07:11] man but when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:15] changed that
[1:07:17] place separated paradise and
[1:07:22] hell to the six dimension
[1:07:26] when you are a Christian and you
[1:07:29] die you are no

[1:10:28] shouting commanding the
[1:10:32] Angels LIF
[1:10:39] up and be lifted

[1:13:43] her I'm the resurrection and the
[1:13:48] life he that believeth in
[1:13:52] me though he were dead
[1:13:56] shall he

[1:14:52] live amen amen hallelujah whosoever
[1:14:58] live now it is speaking to you and
[1:15:02] me and believeth in
[1:15:08] me he shall never
[1:15:12] die amen amen amen let me take you to
[1:15:16] another
[1:15:21] scripture the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:26] the and he says unto
[1:15:29] them chapter 8 The Book of John John 8
[1:15:33] verse
[1:15:35] 51s 51 verily verily I say unto
[1:15:40] you if a man keep my
[1:15:46] say shall never see
[1:15:49] death amen he
[1:15:53] says amen
[1:15:55] um Let Me
[1:15:57] Close
[1:16:00] says if a man keep my
[1:16:06] say shall never
[1:16:09] see allow me to read the last scriptures
[1:16:13] here will close in
[1:16:16] prayer I'm going to read John
[1:16:21] 5 start with verse 24
[1:16:27] I say unto
[1:16:29] you that he my
[1:16:32] weight and believeth on him that sent
[1:16:36] me you see the Lord Jesus Christ telling
[1:16:40] us how to go to the six
[1:16:45] Dimension six dimension
[1:16:56] death only change our daily
[1:17:03] place so from
[1:17:06] the the say of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:10] Christ he says you shall never see
[1:17:14] death that means when you are separated
[1:17:16] from this
[1:17:18] life you go into the six
[1:17:23] Dimension let me read it says and ver
[1:17:26] very I say unto
[1:17:28] you he that believeth my
[1:17:31] word believe on him that sent
[1:17:34] me everlasting life shall not come into
[1:17:40] condemnation but passed from Death unto
[1:17:44] life you believe the saying of the Lord
[1:17:47] Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] vers
[1:17:57] 25 I
[1:17:59] say the is
[1:18:01] coming and now
[1:18:04] is shall hear the voice of the Son of
[1:18:09] God the B says whosoever
[1:18:14] live now the the
[1:18:18] living must be
[1:18:21] quickened by the Holy Spirit
[1:18:24] then they shall never see
[1:18:27] them so if you are not
[1:18:30] quickened then you are not
[1:18:33] resurrected because it
[1:18:36] says I say unto you the hour is coming
[1:18:41] now meaning now the living must be
[1:18:46] quickened the word
[1:18:49] quickening dead and you are Made Alive
[1:18:55] so the holy spirit is the quickening
[1:18:59] power to make you
[1:19:03] leave amen and they that here
[1:19:11] shall
[1:19:13] last you see the voice of
[1:19:17] Resurrection is only to
[1:19:19] those that have heard the gospel of the
[1:19:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:27] will those that are
[1:19:30] alive
[1:19:31] quick die because if you are not
[1:19:35] quickened you can come in the first
[1:19:38] resurrection so the gospel is
[1:19:46] preached that they come the first
[1:19:49] resurrection and when you are
[1:19:51] quickened you are given power
[1:19:55] to overcome
[1:19:56] death when you are separated from this
[1:20:00] life change the dwelling place you are
[1:20:04] not going to hell because already you
[1:20:06] are
[1:20:07] Quicken go to the six
[1:20:10] diens now let me read the last
[1:20:15] verse not at this verse
[1:20:17] 28 for the hour is
[1:20:20] coming in which all that are in the
[1:20:23] graves
[1:20:25] hear his
[1:20:26] voice so if you reject the voice
[1:20:31] today you going to hear in the
[1:20:38] gra those that are quickened
[1:20:41] now the Bible says they will not see the
[1:20:45] second
[1:20:47] death but if you are not quickened while
[1:20:49] you are
[1:20:51] still then you have a problem with the
[1:20:56] you see when we are separated
[1:20:59] from we normally call it
[1:21:02] death and it is
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:08] painful but this is just
[1:21:11] separation changing to
[1:21:17] another Beed the name of the Lord
[1:21:20] Jesus so that you can go to the
[1:21:24] but if you are not quickened
[1:21:29] alive
