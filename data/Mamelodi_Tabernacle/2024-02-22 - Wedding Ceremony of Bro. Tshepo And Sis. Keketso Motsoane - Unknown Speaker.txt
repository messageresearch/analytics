going to be a preaching service no it's just to bring the two together the and it's a blessing amen amen and we were having some other appointments of some people going far but it seems that in my heart I knew that you will have that tolerance with amen amen that's how we wait upon the Lord [Music] so we are blessed uh to have so is not I'm not here for a preaching preaching someone but is just to bring the two together and I believe that we have everything here firstly I will read a scripture preach but to talk to you about the the occasion here because it is from God that's why we should just be happy and accept the condition that God has put us in then you know who is getting married is that you brother yes yeah I see that you are already in a good mood now if you start with joy you will end up with joy amen amen and it was me who was afraid that we've been hanging in there for a long time but then I'm glad to come and see such a good spirit the song saysit upon the Lord [Music] not wait upon the pastor upon the Lord they shall God bless you I'm going to look at the scripture in our days things like marriage and uh it is something that even the people fear some people fear to marry because they reading the papers about the things that are happening in the marriage amen amen but then if you come to the Lord you come without any fear because you shall not fail amen amen and uh I'm going to read a scripture uh in let me say that is Matthews 19 Matthew 19 and since it's not I'm not going to prolong the service because it's marriage amen amen you know I I didn't go to school that much it's just by God's grace that because the the greatest language is the word of God the word is a great teacher Jesus to behave and to amen that's a great teacher and we are going to look into this scripture s Matthew Matthew and chapter 19 more chapter 19 vers 3 to6 bless the reading [Music] I wonder if H our elders here and their families were introduced so that you know if somebody comes to your home to show that day you you accept that as somebody and you are happy that that that somebody has come you will first start by announcing amen amen but otherwise uh since let us just read the scripture chapter 19 Matthew 19 ver 3 to6 vers 3 6 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every CA and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man live five father and mother and shall C to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God have joined together let no man put aand amen amen you may be seated God bless you all right all right because of time let me just say welcome to you all may the Lord bless you amen amen now this is marriage and from God because everything that we do and believe is from God okay amen sometimes we look at our young people today and we pray in my heart that in the last days and my prayer is that this young people roaming the streets amen some come back with children amen say Lord set your ministry to help them marriage is a great thing before God it brings the people together amen amen and man was made in the image of God now we are so thankful at this point in time to have young man and a woman amen amen to have them coming before the altar of God for their marriage it's a wonderful thing because all things started there you know there's no other starting point the starting point God himself because made us in his own now every being of God com back to God amen amen now that's why my brother Here Am amen yes amen and interpret to in English hope hope let me have it right English it's hope sorry hope yes my sister do you agree amen all right amen yeah hope brother hope all right yeah you should know better amen and we are so thankful for brother sister now I will just read and officiate not the preaching but I read here the Pharisees also came tempting him saying unto him is it lawful for a man to and not to put his wife away and he answered and said unto them [Music] have you not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female [Music] amen amen I believe that a question of this nature is being asked even today because we have divorce [Music] now this is another Court here of God A Wedding Marriage amen Amen brother thank you your parents are also here amen amen chose that it is genuine when we see the parents a blessing I remember the word of the Prophet when he said children respect it was a Mother's Day and he said children respect your mama she was the first one to see you when you AR amen amen so that's a good thing and all of the young people let me finish here the Willing now they ask a question it was concerning divorce and but the answer comes in this way have you not read that he who made them at the beginning you know it goes back to the beginning that's where the starting point if you want to get your thing right to the beginning the foundation of you get it right amen amen some men were sent that of vend there was a tree to be uproot because it was causing AOC then they approach me that such and such a family has asked them us to go and to upro the tree I said but did you understand them they didn't say to cut the tree [Music] to OT amen that means you are going to kill it because once it is uprooted it has lost life if you see a tree there and with blue leaves and so for and uh but if it yes the roots are still there when you see this tree you see the life there you know that benath there's something a life supporting amen amen you know if if you see us like this and with our children growing up to uh special age H because when the time of your wedding arrives that is your special AG amen so you come into terms with life beyond youth okay I now I finished yeah now the Lord answered he didn't say man can leave his wife allow it no listen how he answered have you not read that because if you ask a person another man today say if your wife is troublesome is it lawful that you can teach her for another the door put out yeah but now this is Jesus he can answer in that way he can't say drop because he is the author of it he will bring you back to where it started amen because he say he will T his own plan our God God of restoration he's a great builder of peace so here we are marriage is not something you should be terrified of find God first then if you find God that's where you will find your marriage actually without Christ you cannot find right thing I'm not talking about the woman even your marriage should be directed by him amen if you marry that's why people after getting married [Music] they are not sure of that no that is not from God but aing from God go to the Bible because that where it came from now before we we read and we finished the work here I was just reading this part here listen he says you not not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female he made them way in the beginning so that's why we need to go to the beginning if you come it is like when I was buying a second hand then they will tell you uh there's one they call St that one because they say even just after driven out of the gate of that G and should maybe it give you problem you return to [Music] but it's not like that in God God partnership the his creation because that's why he says have you not he which made them when at the beginning you know made them M and and female where it is coming from the beginning and it says and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall give to his wife say girlfriend no his wife to his wife meaning that God partnership you all right amen now let's have it this way for this cause shall a man leave father and mother brother you are a gr now doesn't say and mother no father and mother and they cling to his all right wife now people Mis interpret this they think teach them okay now according to the word of God if we read we realize that Adam had no father and no mother he was a creation [Music] created by that now this system of father and mother came after from the beginning it was not so can somebody tell us about mother's father no they were he was created and okay now let's finish by saying the Lord said challenge them Pharisees this were the people who to come to Jesus every time just to cause problems now it says and said for this cause which cause have you not read made them at the made them M and female now for this cause that they were made beginning shall uh a man oh where where am I verse five yes all right let me start here and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother shall to his wife amen amen was it so from the beginning amen okay amen yeah my brother here he looked first in this book and uh he understood it that he should go back to the amen you know and knowing that with a wife from the beginning he's going to start life together with his wife you know the beginning brother we were Bor Sinners after the fall of Adam but God still make it clear to us if we accept Jesus Christ as our savior that means that we are starting from the beginning because he is the beginning we wouldn't have anywhere to go begin regarding the beginning but what he did he knew that it is the blood that caused the problem and he came to die to take away our sin so that to be regarded as the beginning and to have a wife from the beginning in Jesus Christ amen hey my brother you know our beginning accept Christ as your sa you are receiving the beginning amen all things have passed away and God said behold I make all things new we haven't lost that beginning we should only know that is beginning today [Music] and if we accept him then we'll be going back to the beginning he takes away our sins then we become young again after being washed then it says let me I think my time is up here then he shall give to his wife and they time shall be one flesh the god of restoration he restores again bringing it back again to make them one then wherefore they are no more T but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put us under [Music] he overcame the sin of the beginning and Rewind the whole thing that if you receive him you are receiving the beginning no matter you are a sinner but God has made a way for us I'm glad that I can go back to the beginning M amen so no more restrictions lastly H I will stop here because I'm dealing here with young people from the beginning so God bless you that my brother and my sister they came together I was just introducing them the beginning of things or whatever that cannot keep your marriage of the marriage is the author of theage he is the one who started it and he is the one when my car was giving problems my family said take this car back to it meaning that it is for they want me to take it to for because this that is the beginning of they know come back now God also is a great spiritual mechanic no matter we were Sinners but God of the restoration back now we are going to bring my brother and sister together back to the beginning again and I'm telling you in Christ wife husband and wife can meet together forever andever in Christ Jesus that's why we loveen amen now I end up leaving the Pharisees Beyond because here there's noes it's us amen coming to witness the marriage of a son and a daughter so it doesn't need Pharisees yes with their questions and now from here we are going back to you know that was Abraham our father in faith he said to the eldest in the house go to my land find a wife for my son you get what I mean he didn't say go and look for what did he say he said go and take take a wife you reminded me the right thing not find take because he was she was already it was just a matter take because she is already there in God young men young wom your wife is there your husband is there only you should go to the right chist amen there you will find your Christ canot find him amen amen because it is Christ the beginning of it so we thank the Lord for the young people coming to Christ to have their to get to fight to he said go and do what go and take take amen take means the whole thing is prepared already yeah go and take didn't requ him to use she's ready there amen the the Lord has prepared her just go and take all right amen is it so brother amen so now we are here now to wrap up uh this wedding ceremony
