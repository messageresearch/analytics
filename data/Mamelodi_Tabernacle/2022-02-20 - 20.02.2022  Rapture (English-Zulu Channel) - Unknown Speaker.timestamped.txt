[28:35] we are so grateful lord to meet
[28:39] this tabernacle lord almighty
[28:42] as the believers of the way
[28:45] gracious heavenly father
[28:49] you've seen it
[28:51] before the foundation of the world
[28:54] that we we are with the lord
[28:56] almighty to worship thee
[29:00] we worship thee lord almighty because
[29:04] you are god
[29:06] that has shed your blood
[29:09] and
[29:10] father that blood that you shed within
[29:14] us
[29:15] gracious heavenly father
[29:18] it has created
[29:20] a minor god within our hearts
[29:24] and father
[29:26] we'd like to thank you father because
[29:30] we are not worshipping you
[29:33] because you have done something to us
[29:36] but
[29:37] because we don't have any other place to
[29:40] go
[29:40] [Music]
[29:42] we don't have any god that we can
[29:44] worship
[29:46] and father we are aware of that
[29:49] and we know that you are aware of that
[29:52] most especially lord almighty
[29:55] at the last time
[29:57] at the end time father
[30:00] you came down
[30:02] having an open book
[30:05] and father we saw our names on that book
[30:08] and that's why father when we worship
[30:11] thee
[30:12] we worship thee because we see our names
[30:16] and gracious lord
[30:18] thank you father
[30:20] it's not only that lord
[30:23] you came with a revealed weight
[30:26] and it was revealed in our heart
[30:29] the revelation of the seventh seal
[30:31] father
[30:33] that created the great power in our
[30:35] lives father
[30:37] and that power
[30:39] is the power of the deadpool
[30:42] we are not just repeating more
[30:44] but father is the life of it
[30:47] that is in us
[30:49] thank you lord
[30:51] we always know
[30:53] that
[30:54] the devil
[30:56] by default is our enemy
[30:59] and he knows that
[31:01] he is our enemy
[31:03] and we enjoy fighting him
[31:06] because lord almighty
[31:09] we are above
[31:10] and we are modern conquerors
[31:13] that is why
[31:15] we are not trying to fight him
[31:18] we are here
[31:20] to express
[31:21] our lord gracious lord
[31:23] and we are here
[31:25] to express the power that is gifted unto
[31:28] us
[31:29] thank you father

[31:34] believers are gathered here
[31:37] to come and hear your weight
[31:40] and we declare this place
[31:47] and we declare this praise null and void
[31:49] of any evil spirit
[31:53] because gracious heavenly father
[31:56] is the word of god that is ruling there
[31:59] and
[32:00] is the believers that are here
[32:03] they raise their hands
[32:05] knowing that lord almighty their
[32:07] conscience is clean
[32:09] and their conscience is white
[32:11] that is why you don't have any right
