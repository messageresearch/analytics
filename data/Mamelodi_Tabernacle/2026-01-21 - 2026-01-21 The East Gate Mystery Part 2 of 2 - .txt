TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Because uh we we have seen in the book here. Um, a man that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; I think it's page 32. &gt;&gt; Page 32. &gt;&gt; Uh, h it speaks of east and west here. Uh when you are born, &gt;&gt; life itself when you are bo I mean when you are born is like the sun. &gt;&gt; You go right onto the setting of the sun. From your birth to the setting of the sun. From your birth to the setting of the sun. having &gt;&gt; men. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; that's right. Setting of the sun. &gt;&gt; Man has traveled westward always. The oldest civilization we have is China in the east countries. Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And she keeps traveling westward as it goes and uh on and on to the west. You saw I'm trying to pick up one page here where it says when the when Junior Jackson &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson &gt;&gt; in his vision or or dream. &gt;&gt; Uh now the prophet coming interpreting the dream because he saw a vision. Now Junior Jackson saw the prophet chopping off the top of the pyramid. I don't know if they have fixed that. What's name of mine where I ask for last time because I ran away when the thing was not ready and I had asked for it. Amen. Amen. But let me read to you these things. You'll forgive me. I have some plenty of this and that. &gt;&gt; Now is east. &gt;&gt; You know the major has met the prophet and they said you won't be successful in the east. Uh &gt;&gt; because truly he is not successful in the EAST &gt;&gt; because in the east now &gt;&gt; was another is another dispensation. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when the young man, the young prophet appeared in Jerusalem, uh he was so he he he seemed like a successful man healing the sick. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he found favor with men. But then &gt;&gt; when the time arrived &gt;&gt; for uh manifestation, &gt;&gt; he was not successful. &gt;&gt; Even in the at the cross there were only FEW the resurrection day, &gt;&gt; a a lone woman, she came running with a message, the message that he is risen. Amen. Amen. So if you look now the the magi, you read in your book says is this the time is &gt;&gt; the magi met him and they said you were born under a sign. Now the prophet says you have a sign and a commission. Now he says the the people believe a SIGN as the Lord Jesus said also does this generation come this generation want to see a sign. Now the prophet of God say it's a sign but he says a sign &gt;&gt; it's like when you are standing on top of the mountain looking to the other side and you see a city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. then then you will you will start off now for the city. &gt;&gt; Now he says &gt;&gt; um if you come against um a SIGNPOST and then it tells you JOHANNESBURG JOHANNESBURG. &gt;&gt; Now the signpost signpost. &gt;&gt; Uh, it's not your absolute. &gt;&gt; It's pointing. It's pointing you to &gt;&gt; a destination. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You only have a destiny. Now you need a to reach &gt;&gt; the destination. &gt;&gt; So now he says now a signpost is pointing you to the place where you should be. Now you don't rally and worship around a signpost is pointing you out to something. And that's why John a signpost pointed them to Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; a signpost. &gt;&gt; He came and said, "I am not him." &gt;&gt; He pointed the bride. Behold, &gt;&gt; now the prophet says, "It's time to leave the signpost for the city." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now people rallied around John and John said, "I am not him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was before me and he's coming after me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is a sign. But the prophet says it is from the sign to the commission. &gt;&gt; The prophet has sent us a God has sent us a prophet. That is good. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; Just to is it just to pull out of denomination? &gt;&gt; Then after pulling out what? Get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then after the baptism, what? They came. They saw John. They admired the ministry of John. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so it's the same thing even today. &gt;&gt; They they they they delighted at the sight of the signpost. but not the commission. &gt;&gt; So that's why your book says is this the time &gt;&gt; speaks of the new commission. He says the angel after the the the book that is written within is closed then that angel sees us and then he says it's now time for the seven thunders m ministry. So you have two sides of the same messenger. One side as a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a was what's name? One side as a church as as a start to the church and then let me show you another side. &gt;&gt; Now the people can come to this side of the prophet and he missed the other side because the the announcement of the angel says the time shall be no more. So he chose two things there. Time is church ages and another the announcement also skips to the time shall be no more. Now you come through the seven churches to the seven seals. Seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the seven church ages &gt;&gt; seven church ages &gt;&gt; is men. &gt;&gt; The seven seals &gt;&gt; seven &gt;&gt; is an angel. &gt;&gt; So I have my angel. &gt;&gt; I have my angel. You you have your angel. And the prophet says that angel comes to you. And he says &gt;&gt; that is eternity. &gt;&gt; Now, now you must look in your Bible. &gt;&gt; In your Bible, I'll take Galatians, &gt;&gt; the book of Galatians, chapter 3. Chapter &gt;&gt; 3. I'm looking at this. Uh uh. Is that Galatians? Yes. Yes. Yes. Pardon me. &gt;&gt; My my thin uh pages. Chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. &gt;&gt; Wherefore then the law, it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made. And it was ordained by angels in the hand of the mediator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels. Now part of the seven churches John John said says I heard the voice and I tend to see the voice and he says now in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw the one who had seven stars IN HIS HAND. AND THE interpretation of the stars is the seven angels to the seven churches. &gt;&gt; Now in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw him with seven stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the seven stars in his right hand was a mystery. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he when it was disclosed to John said this is the angels of the seven church ages. Seven church ages. Now here it says &gt;&gt; till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels. Amen. Now at the end of the seven church ages ages, &gt;&gt; we see the ordination of angels. &gt;&gt; And now these seven angels, &gt;&gt; there was one angel to the seven. Uh you are looking at one angel but they were seven angels. &gt;&gt; They were seven angels. But the prophet ended up looking at one angel which is the angel with the seventh seal. the angel with the seven seal. Amen. Um now east before beforeh because you have seven days &gt;&gt; and um h that's why the Bible says in the book of Mark uh on the Sabbath day, the end of the seventh day. Then Mary Magdalene at the end of the &gt;&gt; Sabbath because Sabbath is the seventh day. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll find it here, but I think it's Marks Mark 16. &gt;&gt; Mark 16. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the Sabbath, that's verse one, Mark 16. &gt;&gt; And when the Sabbath was passed, which Sabbath speaks of seven church ages, seven church ages. When the Sabbath was passed, &gt;&gt; when the seven days were passed, &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Saleom had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him. Amen. Amen. Now that was from the end of the seventh day to the first to the first day. &gt;&gt; Now they traveled from the end of the seventh day and they couldn't see him until the first day. Amen. He was only seen on the first day which the prophet says which was Sunday morning which the prophet again says it is again the eighth day. Amen. the the first day is also the eighth day. That's why the Bible speaks of the holy CONVOCATION on the eighth day and the first day. So you have the first day which is the holy convocation you have it as the the eighth day. Now, now with the Jews &gt;&gt; as we saw it in in Kinasa, &gt;&gt; the Jews because they they refused him. Now their ministry was from Sabbath to Sabbath. They couldn't go further. They will start a Sabbath to the end of Sabbath and start another Sabbath. But Mary Magdalene traveled from the Sabbath to the first day and never to celebrate Sabbath again. That was after the end of the Sabbath. Now the Jews, they failed to see him after the Sabbath. And Mary Magdalene saw him after the Sabbath which was the first day which was the eighth day which speaks of eternity. That's why the people today, THE PEOPLE TODAY, they are traveling from a church age to church age. Church age to church, &gt;&gt; never to the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's church AGE TO CHURCH AGE. CHURCH. When they hit the seventh church age, &gt;&gt; they go back to the first church age again and and they they speak of miracles and and wonders and all those things. Not they never reach the third pool where the Lord said I will meet you in there. So that means they have never met the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Mary Magdalene after the Sabbath, she traveled to the first day where she met the Lord. You see, not Sabbath to Sabbath, but Sabbath to a holy convocation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Last thing here. Uh now why the reason &gt;&gt; the question is the reason &gt;&gt; and and that's why the people &gt;&gt; they just failed to see the seven sins &gt;&gt; because no man &gt;&gt; was worthy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we read, &gt;&gt; I won't go back to Thursday, but the prophet says &gt;&gt; man was separated from his theophony and he just came down as a spirit &gt;&gt; because a body of the word. So he bypassed the word. This is the spot where the prophet used to say h that eternal a spot of eternity. A brand name saw a brand name. &gt;&gt; And he calls that one spot of eternity. &gt;&gt; It's not only a brand name and a brand. It's you and &gt;&gt; and you &gt;&gt; now as men bypassed &gt;&gt; the theophony which in that theophony he is worthy. A man bypassed that part. That's that's the reason he was not worthy to open the book. What made him so is he bypassed the theophony. Now for him to be worthy he must connect back to the &gt;&gt; then this makes him a 100% being and this makes him worthy &gt;&gt; because he's he's now part of God. And God brought things before Adam and Adam could name them. &gt;&gt; But after sin. Now this part which comes through the seven church ages churches &gt;&gt; was found not worthy &gt;&gt; to open the seals because the seals is something beyond time. &gt;&gt; But only theophony is beyond time. &gt;&gt; Now that's why if you you read in the Bible Paul says &gt;&gt; when this one shall dissolve, &gt;&gt; we have another We we have another &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul tells you that &gt;&gt; this one &gt;&gt; is is just uh it's something that will that will vanish or or or what do you call now? &gt;&gt; Something that will die. &gt;&gt; This body Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, &gt;&gt; but when this one shall dissolve, &gt;&gt; when this one is dissolved, &gt;&gt; then we have &gt;&gt; and I'll show what the prophet says here. Now here it says just maybe five minutes. Uh look at this now. Now that's why now we have uh we we went through this that that that's why we have two parts of things &gt;&gt; two forms of one body and I find myself wanting uh in this part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh now brother Brenham &gt;&gt; after he had seen the thunders blast because he even says I went west for a blast. Now after seeing h hearing the blast then he says he saw something but he says I didn't understand then I look for interpretation now that part could not interpret the white stone this part. &gt;&gt; So he started to look for interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that is the reason. &gt;&gt; Then he was taken he he went west. Now the the interpretation &gt;&gt; came when he connected the angel's message. He says, "I stood there looking into ETERNITY and he saw the angels coming now not from the church ages but from eternity. So that is beyond time. So his subconscious &gt;&gt; picked up the picture. Then he says and counting from left when the uh the angels in a constellation &gt;&gt; came down. and they count him from left &gt;&gt; to right to the one that picked him up. &gt;&gt; He says that is the seventh. &gt;&gt; Now here's the seventh angel messenger &gt;&gt; and he's counting &gt;&gt; and the seventh &gt;&gt; is the seventh angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody spiritual. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Seven angel messenger. &gt;&gt; A messenger to the church ages agency. &gt;&gt; A part that could that was not worthy to open the sins. Then as the angels lowered THEMSELVES from eternity which is another part. Then he started counting in the CONSTELLATION and he looked at this seventh one that it was notable. And he says the others were &gt;&gt; ordinary &gt;&gt; because all the ANGELS of all the angels one was the spokes angel. You know it it is like how they lead the the lampstands the lambs. &gt;&gt; That's how they lit the first one. Then they took that one, lit the second one and put that one back in its place and take the second one and lit the third one and put this one in its place and take the third one and lead that one and put it in its place. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not like they lead this one and this one. No, it's one light from the first from the first lamp to the seventh. The other six, they receive their light from the first. So, one angel open up and the thing runs through the seven. That's why I can show you in the Bible that you are a sevenfold being yourself because the revelation must run down through the seven. Amen. When God comes to you, he must come through the the the seven down the seven. And the Bible says if you don't have seven vuh even you are blind, you can't see a far off. &gt;&gt; If you don't have That means &gt;&gt; the faculty for seeing &gt;&gt; is seven s things. If you lack seven things, the Bible says you can't see a far. If you see 56 then you have a blare vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you can see seven then if you come to to to the seventh SPOT &gt;&gt; then you can you can see beyond &gt;&gt; that's why after the seven &gt;&gt; the Bible says revelation chapter 4 &gt;&gt; revelation 4 &gt;&gt; the word says John &gt;&gt; come forth and I will show you &gt;&gt; things that will be here after. &gt;&gt; And uh John was summoned up the mountain again by the seventh angel by the seventh angel a seventh angel and said, "Come up higher. And he says he took me to the highest mountain, &gt;&gt; not to the first pool, &gt;&gt; to the highest mountain. And then he says, "Then I saw the new Jerusalem." Now he stood on an earthly mountain. to see a supernatural Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says you hit seven, &gt;&gt; then where are you going? &gt;&gt; If you are not taken in into the king's chamber, &gt;&gt; you are going back. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why today we have the people who don't believe in the five-fold ministerfold minister. They won't even bother to come to the service because to them a pastor is nothing. They also have a ministry. Do you know we have such people they don't care &gt;&gt; come Sunday they are thinking of preaching somewhere they don't care they they don't believe in fivefold ministry. &gt;&gt; Fivefold ministry. &gt;&gt; They make their own callers. I've seen I've seen many ships with colors now wearing colors. I've seen many ships wearing collars. &gt;&gt; I even know their names. Now &gt;&gt; how I how we know them? &gt;&gt; It is because every time they make a sound, it goes me. Have you ever heard a a a shepherd giving out such a sound. &gt;&gt; Me has no interpretation. &gt;&gt; They asked the brother, &gt;&gt; they asked him, &gt;&gt; they asked the brother last uh se last &gt;&gt; Easter How was the conference? &gt;&gt; Now this new pastor was preaching &gt;&gt; to me is a sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now as he was preaching now our deacon asked the brother how was the meeting? He says you know he was just talking And people enjoy man. Let me promise here. You get what I mean? &gt;&gt; You know you as in the Lord, you must grow to a stage to a point where you can distinguish be between the sheep and the shepherd. There's some sheeps sometimes, another sheep can just buy a caller. I mean spiritual caller because you have the natural and the spiritual callers. &gt;&gt; Now you can just get a caller. wear it and the other ships will follow you again. It's a very strange you know you've been doing me together &gt;&gt; only another sheep uh he starts to make a sophisticated man. Then you follow him. But the Bible says my sheep, the Lord says my sheep know my voice. a new color sheep they won't follow &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; the voice &gt;&gt; the voice is a spiritual signitual sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I can hear the voice of the prophet. &gt;&gt; I can hear the voice of the prophet. That's why I have these books here. &gt;&gt; To indicate that I have a prophet &gt;&gt; and I I I've heard the voice. &gt;&gt; Now I'm here for a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Man has traveled Can I take five? Man has traveled eastward always. But now coming back to east again. Then this is the evening light. That is a man that can turn on the light. A man that can turn on the light. Page 33. &gt;&gt; Page 33. &gt;&gt; Right. And then it says, &gt;&gt; "Just like the sun, &gt;&gt; just like the sun, &gt;&gt; the s u n su n &gt;&gt; has traveled like the s o n. The church has come to the same from seven church ages. forth civilization moved right on to the WEST and the church has moved right onto the west. And now if we go any further then where are we now? &gt;&gt; We come back east again. &gt;&gt; So you leave the WEST COAST COAST &gt;&gt; go right back into China &gt;&gt; Japan. right back again &gt;&gt; to the east again. So east and west has met. &gt;&gt; Now it's a complete thing, a a complete lied. And the reason I went west to I had to go west to connect with the angel's message. This angel's MESSAGE NOW DON'T forget that the seven seal me message is is the angel's message. I went to connect with the angel's message to come back here east to reveal it to the church. Oh, I think you understand. You won't try to take your car and go east. We are talking about supernatural things. We are talking about spiritual things. So God showed it naturally when he placed men eastward and he shows it spiritually. And this east place, east gate That's where Abel and &gt;&gt; Cain worshiped. And that's where God placed the cherubim with a sword to guard the way of the tree of life which the prophet says that Satan don't understand it. He understands the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. BUT NOT THE tree of life. &gt;&gt; So the the the prophet open UP so he went west as he said Junior Jackson says after he chopped the top after he saw the prophet chopping the top he said look down in And he said, "Stay here until I return." Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he returned, &gt;&gt; he found only few. The rest had gone on because the major said, "You shall not be successful IN THE EAST. That's why there is only few now &gt;&gt; in the sales dispensation. So I came back to reveal it. I came back to reveal it to the church. And the angel who flew to me &gt;&gt; was the seventh seal angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now &gt;&gt; that's why when they when he opened the seven, it was silent. Amen. &gt;&gt; The angels stopped &gt;&gt; because they were used to something. They had seen God the Almighty. They had seen men made lower. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. to to be tested and so forth. &gt;&gt; Now when the thing connected back again together, then the angel stopped. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him because he faced me and chased my salvation. All right.
