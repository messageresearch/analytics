Description:
Title: The fourth stage brings awaited results
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa on 23-03-2025 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
II Kings 2: 1 – 6
The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the fourth stage that brings the awaited results.

The journey of Elijah and Elisha happened in four steps. Malachi 4 brought the awaited results.

The son of Man revealed himself in a man called Branham. The Son of man was bringing the awaited results. He brought back life. The seventh seal and the third pull are in unity. The seventh seal is the thing that brings the hearts of the children back to their fathers.

If there is no revelation of the seventh seal, then we do not have the revelation of the son of man and we do not have Melchisedec.

Elisha said, as the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth I shall not leave there. Because there was an inward connection that cannot be broken by anything. A man that has tasted God you cannot quench his thirst.

God has predestinated that in each age there should be messengers and under those messengers there should be foreordained pastors who will continue the ministry the way the messenger preached.

A predestinated sheep will be able to see a predestinated pastor and a predestinated messenger.

When the seventh seal is revealed to you, it reveals everything.

The Pastor read the following Spoken words:

62-0422 The Restoration of The Bride Tree Par 505 - 507
58-1005E God Called Man Par 68 - 76

say Pastor doesn't love you even they say does not love you I love [Music] him and I don't I don't think there is anything which can separate me from him when he calls I will answer when he calls I answer let's read the scripture for dedication of children Mark 10: 13-6 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them amen you may take your seat how are you hey you are fine oh is you oh thank you very much um God bless you uh do you believe that you have brought your children to him not to me not to Pastor but to him but I'm standing here representing him and I

Sister God bless you amen God bless you uhuh you may take your seat we are going to take another Direction um there are people I'm going to call here and they must when I call them they must stand up uh from Cape [Music] Town we can call them John M me f Alfred amen and you call this one also this ones also H from help me yeah amen okay from Elizabeth come here is he AUD enough nasis and okay and this one oh oh thank you very much are they all here 4 five six how many should they be that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 six from Cape Town oh six okay they're all here brother B say here yeah brother B another one another one last one I for another [Music] one brother Bram that is that is the first is the placing some deacons into the church and our little church here is Sovereign it doesn't have any denomination or anything to send his Deacons [Applause] [Music] it elects its own deacons it elects its Pastor it elects his trustees it elects everything that comes in and out of the church no one no one person has the say so over anything is the church and the church are those who come and support the the church with their presence with their tithes and offerings are always the ones that has the legal say [Music] so in placing of such in other words our church is the one that elects no one is electing but we've got a process of electing the present B the one that will elect it will select some men which they think they are suitable men and after they've selected those men they must bring them to the pastor and the pastor must look at the men and the pastor after looking at them man he will screen them according to the word of God and ACC the spoken way when the pastor is satisfied that they are qualified then the pastor and the church they will take those men into the church for the church to vote for them for individually when they are voted for them if they are deacons they must be tested first they must be given two weeks or one week the church looking at them and we are look and and the both looking them and they also must satisfy themselves they are Fe people I believe Elders they have done the same all the process has been done when the processes have been done then they they are brought to the Elder the pastor but Prophet says put your very best men you can on your board you see you must just put any man there you must put the very best man I believe the Cape Town Bo and the the the PE Bo they've placed the best men they had have placed the best men head because like that brother don't never get nothing else in there don't never get nothing else in there don't don't get get nothing that's in there put it the best you [Music] can and test that man firstest and a Deon got more responsibility than the pastor has are you listening Brothers they've got more responsibility when the church start to get confused we look at the deons where where were the Deacons they've got more responsibility to keep order in the church when people get out of order we look at the they said the certain man came into the church and shoot the pastor and the the prophet said where were the deons because they should have seen him when he get inside the da what kind of a man was he get inside there so that they they should have gone after him and hold the man before he shoot the pastor they shed their responsibility he has to be blameless [Music] a should be in perfect harmony with the doctrine of their church words they must know the doctrine of the church perfectly I believe you know the doctrine of your church and they must be imperfect Harmony that's why when you see a deacon getting getting out of Step first you must took him out because if you you leave that man there get out of Step you are going to destroy the church he must be in perfect harmony with the doctrine of the church he must support you must be the first man to support the pastor he must be the first to to prevent the pastor he mustn't be the first man to talk about the pastor that one must be taken off they must be in perfect harmony with the doctrine of their Church they should stay perfectly the interpretation of the scriptures of their Church because if they don't they are fighting against the very thing they are they are hating themselves deacons trusties treasurers must be in Perfect Harmony among themselves amen among together with the pastor they mustn't do anything if the pastor don't know [Applause] it um I've read the order and the prophet say now let this first be try it and see if they desire the office within a few weeks God willing I will return back to lay hands upon this group of men to make them the official the official the official deacons of this church and trust and treasur we've got I've left a book somewhere but doesn't matter an elder is an elder because of his age in the church and his St and his reliability in the church then we see that one is an whether ordained or not ordained not not elected or not elect but because of his chronological age in the church it qualifies him to be an elder in the church but reliability must be there when he when when cases arise he has got an experience he come far with this church he knows things which happen there and how those things were solved and when things are brought to him because he will help the deacons and the trustees he must be a reliable [Music] man the man who doesn't take sight let me read something here tonight we have little change in the [Music] service but today I say today this morning we have change in the we have F brother here they come to ask from say from Nazar church I would say from Elizabeth in cap town I think that is right he called the name he said brother wishing tonight to be ordained by us by laying hands on we do not have papers to give out to anyone yet we are recognized we could have papers we could we could but we believe that a a true ordained minister his papers is in heaven see he has the right to preach the Bible as long as God identifies his life with the Bible we believe that that is his credential you find something different in out of the Bible if you do it will be out of the Bible that is exactly the way they did in the Bible time was laying hands upon them in ordination they laid hands upon the deons and put them in the church and everything was by laying of hands not signing up a bunch of papers joining a certain something like that they laid hands on and turn him loose in the Holy Spirit and let him go amen amen God lead him the way he wants to that is the way we believe in doing we believe in laying hands when we lay hands on people we we are not making them deons they they really chosen by the church we give them the right of way that is in the Bible way now H I will start with the deons first then after that I will go to trust then I will ask Elders here we shall go down then go lay hands on these brothers all deacons is aacon from what from Elizabeth they must stand this way and then um and then and then how many are they three there are three and then the fourth one Peter madua Peter mad M let's then after that you call us for trustees amen my okay you close your eyes you pray with us pet pray pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ say we approach thee father through the doctrines that you have given us Lord hallelujah we come to you Lord yes by the inspiration that you give us our Doctrine thought us father that if anybody occupies I mean qualifies exactly to be a Deon should be appointed accordingly as the pastor has explained exactly and therea tested and this morning we have our brothers here of which they gone through all the the necessary checkup and they themselves volunteered that they will be sincere to the church amen thank you they will serve the church amen they will respect the church they will know that they are not dictators they're just the seventh in the church and they will know that they've got a doctrine that they

leaveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl and the sons of the prophets that were at bethl came forth to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it hold ye your peace and elishah said unto him Elijah said unto him him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord ha sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord leaveth and as thy soul leaveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yeah I know it hold ye your peace and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord leaveth and as thy soul leaveth I will not leave thee and they too went on amen amen um I would like you perap all right let's pray and sit down ourly father thank you for this privilege I privileged with by my Elder Pastor here standing in front of your children you know I have nothing but you are the one who can say something to your children if you can allow me and use my voice and my interpreter's voice we pray come and bless your children in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we may take our seats as I've said um I not I'm not going to be long I don't know what God is having I've said that the topic is the fourth stage brings the awaited results and where we have read we have read about the Journey of Elijah and Elijah and that Journey has taken four steps but we have others things which happened just like um when I read in the book of restoration here it says if four messengers of death killed the tree four messengers of Life restored the tree do you get it congregation says amen for God said I will restore it he going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first it was Martin Luther with justification what was the second John wesleyy by scientification what was the thir Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts and the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the we what the way there were four great prophets one of Martin Luther he began to shine a little light but there was little light just very small [Music] strength of justification Along come Wesley stronger sanctification in other words it was a stronger light and after wle come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophecy but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very weight the weight of the the Lord come to the prophet in the evening life is to come forth to restore all and bring back what turn the hearts of the children to the faith of God the fourth light as we have said the fourth stage will bring the requested the awaited results this Malachi chapter 4 brought the fourth light not man per but the son of man revealed himself he himself the son of man revealed himself in a man called William the son of man revealed himself there then the son of man was bringing the awaited results because the son of man is Christ and the son of man is the one who brought what we needed he he brought back life all these ways it was little little little until it comes to the for this man brought the last thing because the seventh seal and the third pool they are they are this they are they are in unity because the seven SE is is in fact the thing that brings the hearts of the children back to the faith of their fathers without the revelation of the seven SE there is no bringing back of us the heart are brought back by the revelation of the seven se but if there is no revelation of the seven SE then we have got no revelation of the son of man then we don't have MC because M revealed himself through the man in in those days it was a man there who Abraham gave him food to eat but it was a man who just took soil and made a body and go inside it but in our days by Grace is a man who was [Applause] born by men and woman uh this this fourth stage here but let me just go back a little when we go back to the second Kings we find that Elijah moved for three for four steps he moved from Gil to from to from to then after Jord is where he get the the awaited results when when they were there together with Elijah at B said Elijah said to Elijah stay here when they are at gil stay here I am going to bet God called me there and in betel which was the house of God Elijah said to Elish just stay here and elishah couldn't think that way because he know there was more for him so he said as the Lord leaveth and you are so leaveth I will not leave you it was an inwhite following not outside one he was like Peter when Peter said to Jesus to whom shall we go because the word of eternal life is in you that is what Peter said also Elijah said here I will never leave you because there was an inside connection which cannot be broken by anything he wanted something inside this man which some people have not seen he was the only one who has seen that there at B he found a bunch of Scholars there they were all well trained preachers they said to elishah do you know that your master is going to be taken away from you the a man that has ever tasted God you cannot quench his test a man-made citizen because he has tated something he tated something from El he said as you as the Lord leave and you are so leave it I will never leave you we know God lived in your soul and you also live you live in your soul then if God is in your soul if God lives in your soul you are in your soul then you and God the one if your soul is from there and God is from there then when you see God you will recognize him but if your soul is not from there if God is presented to you and if you are from there if God is presented to you in whatever form you will recognize him but if you are not from there you will recognize God in some form the form which they have told you that God is there you will try to to believe that but some things will stop you from believing that because your connection is not from there but if it is from there when you see God in any form go go send us a prophet he he has called us to come out when the prophet was preaching I wasn't there but I I've heard the prophet through this man when he was preaching I wasn't there but now I'm preaching the prophet because someone [Music] [Applause] because when Moses had to leave the children of God children of isra through death he placed J but there was the request of the people they said to Joshua Joshua Joshua whatever you said to to us whatever you say we must do we will do it but on condition if the God was in Moses if you can see him in you then whatever you say then we will follow it if the prophet said the weight is this is a secret the weight is in the bright then he's G but you see under predestination God has pred that each age there must be a messenger there and under each messenger there must be pastors there but for ordained pastors who were there in the mind of God when God was amen putting the ages [Music] together when he was putting the age and the [Music] messenger he was putting also the pastor that will continue the ministry the way the prophet the way the messenger has preached they will continue that's why we are [Applause] here I'm preaching what I'm preaching what brother has said because someone who has the connection connection with the prophet preached it to me it was the current moving move from the Power Station moving from the electrical powers until to that station there all all things which connect from that they have got the same [Applause] Elijah El saw something like that just like me he said if the Lord leaveth and you are soul then if the soul of the pastor leave it means God is living [Applause] if that soul is dead the world is not living those who are following they following amen not God because it must be predestination a predestinated pastor predestinated sheep they will see the predestinate pastor and see the predestinate messenger because it's a chain you cannot cut it it must be from there it must be from there coming down until here [Applause] then you are taken back your heart is brought back you see we were preaching we were reading you I've read the book of seals I have read it several times and until it becomes in TAS but one day when the p with the revelation of it then I left it when I look at it I just see what they want because someone revealed to me the seven SE when the seven SE is revealed to you it reveals [Music] everything let me that's why what this Elijah has seen there are people who are hating pastors Pastor is nothing if they are not from there you see you are predestinated under this pastor who is not predestinated will those who are predestinated they will remain because I read somewhere the the the resurrection be like a wave you say will be the the messenger and the pastors under the messenger and the ships under this pastor just a w and if you say pastors are nothing you don't have a pastor when the Resurrection comes when the P when The Messengers come and pastors come with their ship them where are you going to [Applause] appear there is no sheep will be hanging there say no I'm under the messenger that is not predestination of God that is not the purpose of God the purpose of God was the messenger the pastors and the [Applause] Sheep but it is it is by Grace if you can have an eye just like this man to recognize where God is people were there he say he found a bunch of Scholars they were all well trained preachers they said to Elijah they they trying to tell Elijah the secret they say do you know your master is going to be taken away from Elijah said because a man who ever tasted God cannot be his test his his his Fest will never be quenched by anything it will not be quenched by a manmade citizens he he didn't have time for that kind of stuff he had done tasted heaven in his soul listen to what he said yes I know but hold your peace in other words he says I know where I am going I know what I am after do you know what you are after if you don't know what you are after you will sit down there and start to scrutinize the P see this pastor you see that day he said this that day he this you don't know what look he said I know hold your [Music] peace because he isn't going to because what you are telling me because what you are telling me is not going to do me any good Elijah said down to Elijah here he was they were at Jero now he said Terry here for the Lord sent me to to Jero he said to to him at betel there leave here I'm going to Jero he said as the Lord no I don't I don't want to leave you so they came to Jero the sons of prophet said J to Elish said unto him know thou that the Lord will take your master today he answered said yes I know hold your peace Elijah said unto Elijah here because I pray for the Lord had sent me to Jordan Elijah said the men were touched to God he said as the Lord leaveth as as your soul leaveth I will not leave thee they had a purpose both of them you see [Music] Elijah Elijah and elah elishah types the bride who knows where life is because if you are part of the Bride you are part of life you move with life life moves with life and death moves with you are influenced from where you are if you are from above you will be influenced from there if you are from below you infuence from there we are from different directions from different kingdoms then we we have met yeah Jesus said to the phes you are from beneath I come from above those who are from God they will hear me you don't hear me because you came from your father the devil but the works of the devil is what you are doing and you are persisting to do the work of the he is a liar the person saying I'm in the message but being a liar just talking things he doesn't he doesn't have any witness or something about full of hatred he doesn't even qualify to be a foolish Vision because you see a foolish Vision Jesus said come come he blessed to my father and inherit the Kingdom inherit the Kingdom which was prepared for you before the foundation of the world because you love this bre he said to this he said to this ones who are full of hatred he said go You cast he said both of them went to Jordan and Jordan means death and or separation it was the last stage of their Journey 50 men of the sons of the prophet stood far off looking I was preaching somewhere Pastor said you preach the at the bual service what can I preach [Music] [Applause] because I P things of where I come from [Applause] amen they are looking far off they said the seals are open they were looking a when they see the two at because the children of God are moving they are wait they have got something waiting praise God we are waiting for Rapture and we're already in the Rapture aane because Rapture is an aerplane is taking us somewhere it started back there taking the last [Applause] passengers and it's it's just idling there is in the [Applause] runway when you look this way when you look this way you see rapture people will say what thist you talk about rapt some talk about it but they don't know what Rapture is because Rapture is in you if Rapture is not in you then forget about we can't stop you to talk about it but forget something was in elij he he wanted the part of this man he wanted it he followed must be a good follower at Jordan there Elijah took his rope smth the water of Jordan and Jordan open up they cross on a dry when they got on the other side not when he was at gil it was the first step not when they were at B when they are at the fourth step at Jordan after theyve crossed elah Elisha said to Elijah what will you that I do for you before I'm taken away from elishah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me elishah said you have asked a hard thing but if you will see me when I go away it shall be so un while they were still talking there The Chariot of fire separated them when the Chariot of fire went up the of Elijah came down that's why when the prophet goes he said this is the secret the word that is the final stage has given us the final awaited result he said now the weight is in the bride the bride knows what to do with the way because he has the Lord he does nothing if he has not what the way said he she is Guided by the weight she live by the we she the weight when he went when the when when Elijah Elijah pick it up he went to Jordan he said the spirit of el is here he took the r of and Smo there people who were looking they said that is the spirit of Elijah is in that man people must recognize that we have got the seven seat people must recognize that you have received the awaited result we know what the is the prophet said if our ministry does
