[0:01] is now in the heart of
[0:05] men so if I want to go to get to the
[0:10] ark I must find a
[0:12] [Music]
[0:14] man because the
[0:20] AR he says
[0:24] the is in the heart
[0:28] of is in the heart of
[0:32] men the Throne of
[0:34] God is in the heart
[0:37] of the pill of
[0:42] fire amen so in the last
[0:47] days
[0:49] God appeared in different
[0:54] ways but in the last
[0:56] days he has put all those things in
[1:04] Amen in the old
[1:07] days you know all things were in
[1:11] Adam and and
[1:14] sin sin caused him to
[1:20] lose so things were now
[1:23] [Music]
[1:25] outside and God gave gave them laws yeah
[1:31] yeah amen am
[1:35] ordinances until in Hebrew chapter
[1:40] 8 God says
[1:43] there Paul
[1:45] quot that God said now I will make a New
[1:54] Covenant the New
[1:56] Covenant he says I will put them in them
[2:03] men because men had to keep
[2:09] them they were
[2:12] without so God second
[2:17] Covenant god's second
[2:22] Covenant is to put those things
[2:28] inside
[2:30] now we have the first which is the seven
[2:33] Church
[2:36] ages things are
[2:39] outside the pill of fire is
[2:43] outside you see things
[2:46] outside but the seven
[2:49] SE a New
[2:53] Covenant that's when
[2:55] God puts all this those things inside
[3:03] and now
[3:04] today we don't go around looking for the
[3:07] P of
[3:10] fire that P of
[3:12] fire the prophet says is now
[3:18] in amen
[3:21] because we are the last men standing
[3:26] now we are the
[3:28] last
[3:31] amen so now all things are now
[3:36] inside there's no other Prophet
[3:41] coming
[3:53] coming so this is what
[3:58] theeven
[4:06] things
[4:18] were so the that
[4:23] book so now the
[4:27] people these days they have to turn to
[4:30] the
[4:33] bride the book is the
[4:44] bride you the
[4:46] book spoken
[4:52] original the prophet
[4:54] says this is now the
[4:58] secret the way
[5:06] now the word is not Aon the word is
[5:14] Theos the word is now
[5:19] God we were looking at this the other
[5:24] day seven Church
[5:27] ages it was the word of God alloted to
[5:34] ages that age had this part of
[5:39] the of
[5:42] the until
[5:45] seven amen now when it comes to
[5:50] seven it's no longer a part of the word
[5:54] to a church
[5:58] is
[6:01] the prophet says now the secret
[6:04] now is the
[6:07] word not to a church
[6:10] age word in the
[6:16] Bri because I will still repeat
[6:20] that
[6:22] [Music]
[6:24] manifestation the last
[6:26] thing is in the briad
[6:31] [Applause]
[6:33] now I can read something again
[6:36] here brother say
[6:39] here
[6:41] when
[6:43] Abram and
[6:46] sah when they were looking for a
[6:52] son for the coming
[6:55] [Music]
[6:56] son for 25 years
[7:01] years they had looked for
[7:04] it now he says now they were at the end
[7:08] of The
[7:12] Journey God appeared to them in many
[7:19] forms as he has through the church
[7:24] ages you see he just appeared in many
[7:28] forms
[7:32] amen you know with Elisha let's go back
[7:36] to
[7:38] Elisha
[7:40] El experienced many things with
[7:47] elij but when they reach
[7:52] over he received the M from
[7:57] elij all right
[8:00] now the prophet
[8:01] says at the end of The
[8:05] Journey God appeared to them in many
[8:08] forms like through as he has Through the
[8:15] Ages lights and so
[8:19] forth as he spoke to
[8:22] Abraham by
[8:25] Voices and before the coming son could
[8:28] arrive
[8:31] amen amen and then he changed their
[8:38] bodies and sah immediately after
[8:43] this so he changed so they could receive
[8:47] the
[8:52] son now the prophet referring to the
[8:55] change of the body to us today the
[8:58] prophet
[9:03] he says it's another man in
[9:09] [Applause]
[9:11] you
[9:13] says the New
[9:16] Life Starts from that
[9:21] man
[9:24] in Amen to bring the
[9:28] son
[9:30] that is the
[9:31] change we are already
[9:38] changing we come to that let's read this
[9:41] one here so
[9:44] now the last
[9:47] sign that they got before the son
[9:53] arrived was Jehovah talken to them in
[9:56] the form of a man
[10:02] that is the last
[10:05] [Music]
[10:08] sign the last thing the last
[10:13] sign
[10:15] is speaking to
[10:18] them in the form of
[10:23] man as you see the seven was the last
[10:28] sign
[10:30] when God came
[10:32] down and spoke to
[10:35] us in the form
[10:38] of that is the last
[10:42] sign
[10:44] amen okay now that show it shows
[10:49] that all this
[10:52] time God was coming to one
[10:58] place now now let's continue as we look
[11:01] at this
[11:05] things I love them because they make me
[11:09] to see
[11:12] myself they make me to see
[11:23] myself now H we will I I will go down
[11:27] here the thing is it comes down to a
[11:34] manifestation as brother
[11:37] says the whole world the whole
[11:43] world is waiting for the manifestation
[11:47] of the sons of
[11:54] God people had
[11:57] come for many many
[12:02] years the prophet says the prophet
[12:07] says yeah that is good I also I do the
[12:11] same
[12:14] thing but if that don't come to a
[12:21] manifestation then
[12:24] like I'm saying to
[12:27] you the prophet said
[12:32] this amen amen so I'm informing
[12:37] you that the prophet said
[12:43] this but
[12:45] now what the people are expecting
[12:51] now is not what the prophet
[12:56] said it is the fulfill
[13:04] [Music]
[13:12] speaks
[13:16] says God gave him a
[13:21] Ministry for you to fulfill the word of
[13:27] God and that's why
[13:31] in the book spoken is the original
[13:35] SE
[13:37] says God has a little bride like
[13:45] Mary and he says
[13:50] through shall be shall the shall be a
[13:57] fulfillment of the word of
[14:01] God all that God has promised in his
[14:06] word be
[14:08] fulfilled in this little bride of
[14:13] Christ because brother
[14:16] says with the Lord Jesus
[14:19] Christ we don't see all
[14:21] things
[14:24] fulfill because part of that weight is
[14:27] the pride
[14:31] now he say the word prod the
[14:36] S which is Jesus
[14:38] Christ the prod of the
[14:41] word but it was not yet a
[14:47] complete
[14:48] because part of that is the
[14:54] Bri now that's why he had to send
[15:01] to come for the
[15:04] bride and that's why
[15:07] say now
[15:10] the the
[15:16] secret before the foundation of the
[15:19] world is now in
[15:27] the
[15:30] you see
[15:31] now and he says it is because with Jesus
[15:37] Christ he played one part of
[15:40] each and the bride has to fulfill the
[15:43] other
[15:47] part
[15:54] Masterpiece
[15:56] messenger he also
[16:00] came and at the end of it
[16:03] all he says I
[16:11] must he must
[16:15] increase that means he must get
[16:22] married it is no good that he should be
[16:27] alone am amen amen that's why God made
[16:31] him to sleep on the
[16:35] cross to take the woman out
[16:41] of saw that it is no
[16:45] good his son remains
[16:49] alone amen because in that
[16:54] condition he cannot
[16:57] increase
[16:59] he could not reprod
[17:02] reproduce so he must have a
[17:07] wife so at the end of
[17:10] time then he sends out the seventh
[17:15] Messenger to choose a
[17:17] wife for his
[17:20] son among the
[17:22] wom that means among the
[17:26] churches bring a woman
[17:29] a Virg for
[17:31] Christ now he says this woman because
[17:36] the groom the bridegroom is is the
[17:40] word now the must be the
[17:45] word amen so the word will has come to
[17:50] Mar the
[17:54] word so that's why it was supposed to to
[17:58] be fulfilled in the
[18:04] bride to
[18:06] bring wife for the
[18:11] Lord now I was reading to you from the
[18:15] book Fellowship by
[18:21] Redemption the
[18:25] place he says I never believed that
[18:29] heaven was a place where there is a
[18:32] bunch of
[18:35] [Music]
[18:40] buildings I have never believed that a
[18:43] supernatural being would have to live in
[18:46] a leral
[18:52] house I believe that when Jesus spoke in
[18:55] the Book of John in my father's houses
[18:58] many
[19:03] mentions he meant a
[19:15] body the mentions in in my in his
[19:18] father's
[19:21] house is the
[19:25] bodies he said I'm going to prepare that
[19:27] place
[19:31] because you know
[19:32] what when he
[19:35] died the Bible tells us
[19:38] that the graves were
[19:43] opened
[19:48] and and the bodies of many
[19:54] Saints came
[19:56] for amen and you know they they were
[19:59] that cloud that took him
[20:02] away the
[20:04] Saints the Saints the
[20:08] Believers those who
[20:12] died when he was on the
[20:16] cross you know the Bible says he cried
[20:20] out and there was a power of
[20:25] God that
[20:27] came
[20:30] and and opened the veil in the
[20:36] temple and went down to open the
[20:42] graves it was the
[20:45] souls brother says the
[20:49] spirits of those who went
[20:53] before and those now in in those days
[20:59] there were a there was a
[21:02] place where the dead were put
[21:09] in or
[21:11] placed that was
[21:14] Paradise now this
[21:17] paradise the Lord Jesus
[21:20] says both the righteous and the
[21:22] unrighteous went to that
[21:27] place but there was a gulf
[21:34] between the righteous on this
[21:36] sideous on the other
[21:40] side now when he died and he rose
[21:46] again he he he there was
[21:51] an what do you call now
[21:57] immigration
[21:59] those who were
[22:01] there in the in the Fifth
[22:06] Dimension he he they
[22:13] migrated to the six
[22:17] Dimension is that
[22:19] right so that's why he says I am going
[22:23] to prepare a place for
[22:26] you
[22:28] because
[22:29] now he had he was going to prepare now
[22:33] the sixth
[22:38] Dimension there was a
[22:41] migration of the people from The Fifth
[22:45] Dimension from from
[22:48] Paradise to the six
[22:51] Dimension amen amen so he says
[22:55] now that's why he says
[22:58] I'm going to prepare you a
[23:01] place so that where I
[23:05] am you may be
[23:08] also that's why now you are where he
[23:14] is you are where he
[23:20] is and he is where you
[23:25] are that is what happened in the last
[23:30] days amen and
[23:35] say man and
[23:37] God came from the same
[23:44] place yeah they they came from the same
[23:49] place so if they are from the same
[23:52] place then
[23:55] today they live in the same place
[24:00] because they are together
[24:03] again the
[24:05] seven put and God together
[24:09] again the
[24:12] seven is
[24:20] the
[24:22] SE so the thir
[24:25] po all this time
[24:28] the prophet had some
[24:30] Visions he healed the
[24:33] sick he he he did many
[24:38] miracles but when it comes to the third
[24:42] pool he
[24:44] says I will meet you in
[24:49] there amen but all this
[24:53] time he saw
[24:55] Vision he did that and that
[25:00] but the thir
[25:01] says I will meet you in
[25:06] there amen am so it's something greater
[25:10] than what he's being seeing or
[25:13] [Music]
[25:17] performing because he says now I will
[25:21] meet you in
[25:25] there now this is greater than a vis
[25:31] amen okay
[25:34] now as I'm looking at
[25:38] this I I
[25:42] believe when Jesus spoke of a
[25:46] place he spoke of a Dwelling
[25:51] Place amen for the Bible
[25:55] says when our
[25:58] be
[26:01] dissolved we have
[26:05] another now it's not just a tabernacle
[26:10] it's a
[26:14] place all right
[26:17] so we can read on and on and
[26:21] on that is in
[26:23] another
[26:26] dimension
[26:28] but I'm I I just want to go back to
[26:30] where I have read
[26:34] here okay now if I read in another
[26:41] book now the place he
[26:44] meant he refers to
[26:48] [Music]
[26:51] your you know brother
[26:55] says in the book um
[26:58] there was one brother he was Disturbed
[27:00] and say you could BR many
[27:03] times more than you you could amen okay
[27:08] now here we are with the members of
[27:13] the um
[27:19] in who is
[27:23] this now he
[27:26] says and
[27:30] you byass your you
[27:38] know before I go
[27:41] there he says look when he was first
[27:46] when when he was first
[27:48] made Adam he was made two people
[27:56] together he was made both male and
[28:02] female men was the Bible said he
[28:08] was God made men male and
[28:12] female created
[28:15] him now when men were separated from
[28:21] the and put in the
[28:26] flesh
[28:28] all
[28:29] right maybe I can try something
[28:32] here man was
[28:35] put when he was put in
[28:40] the then he was made
[28:45] flesh I mean when he was
[28:50] separated amen now I know the pastors
[28:54] teach of these
[28:56] things
[29:00] I don't know if you can see
[29:03] this but if we can we come down the
[29:11] stages
[29:14] yeah uh you know French yes spirit in
[29:23] French Spirit the in Fr
[29:28] funny ah God bless
[29:31] you it is still funny so we will post
[29:35] speak
[29:37] French now the third is
[29:50] men okay okay now God of spirit j a
[29:56] spirit and the Bible
[30:00] says
[30:01] says God is a spirit with a capital
[30:07] S and here me I am a spirit with small
[30:17] s
[30:19] amen and if you come down
[30:23] here it's he says the
[30:26] logos
[30:28] now
[30:29] Theos is the entire word of
[30:34] God and
[30:36] here I am
[30:42] a he he is a
[30:45] spirit I'm a
[30:50] spirit and he became
[30:53] Theos I'm
[30:56] the now
[30:59] logos
[31:02] is is the whole word of
[31:06] godos which means
[31:11] that you are part of
[31:19] Theos now that's why we read the in the
[31:24] word says in the beginning was the word
[31:29] which is
[31:30] the is
[31:33] Christ and is the
[31:36] word that's
[31:39] Theos
[31:40] now the Bible
[31:43] says John
[31:45] one begin was
[31:48] the was with
[31:50] God was
[31:51] God right and we always
[31:56] quote down to verse
[32:00] 16 and the Bible says and there was a
[32:04] man s from
[32:06] God a man that is sent by
[32:10] God is Not Like a Man sent from
[32:15] God because many are sent but few are
[32:23] chosen now the prophet
[32:26] says we bypass
[32:31] this from the
[32:34] spirit to being a
[32:38] man God made us to bypass
[32:44] our in
[32:46] order to be
[32:49] [Music]
[32:50] tested as human
[32:54] beings all
[32:56] right now because we bypass
[33:00] that that's why you have a hunger and
[33:04] longing in
[33:07] you
[33:09] because you you you you are a
[33:12] [Music]
[33:14] reflection now now if we were
[33:18] [Music]
[33:20] in we wouldn't have come to be
[33:25] tested if Jesus remained
[33:28] a
[33:31] spirit he couldn't
[33:34] die and we couldn't be
[33:37] tested so God had to bring the thing or
[33:40] everything
[33:43] down in order to become the Healer the
[33:46] Redeemer and all
[33:51] that now before we close here's the
[33:54] mystery of
[33:55] it
[33:58] now here we become Soul a living
[34:05] Soul now if you read page 80 if I read
[34:09] page 80 of the book of my uh Hebrew
[34:15] [Music]
[34:18] book The Prophet says to
[34:22] me this the soul of man
[34:27] was
[34:31] that that
[34:35] means as a predestinated
[34:40] being your soul
[34:42] here is a reflector of
[34:50] this that's why
[34:53] now throughout the the the seven Church
[34:59] ages your soul is
[35:01] [Music]
[35:03] active but when the seals were
[35:08] open your is
[35:12] active because here is
[35:16] time with seven Church ages is
[35:20] time but Seven Seals is beyond
[35:25] time
[35:27] [Music]
[35:28] seven are
[35:34] Beyond they can only be picked up
[35:38] by
[35:41] only can pick up the seals the
[35:45] revelation of the seven
[35:51] SE now I'm not talking about the seven
[35:54] in the
[35:55] book which anybody can read and
[36:00] say the first SE is
[36:04] right we are talking about the
[36:07] revelation of
[36:08] [Music]
[36:10] it the revelation of
[36:13] it is a
[36:18] man now the
[36:21] people after
[36:23] reading they come to
[36:25] men
[36:30] you the
[36:32] Jews
[36:34] Pharisees
[36:36] priest they always come to the synagogue
[36:40] with the scrs like
[36:44] this amen amen and here comes
[36:48] Jesus now
[36:50] Jesus is the Fulfillment of what is in
[36:54] their
[36:55] SC
[37:01] [Music]
[37:05] they said to him you make yourself
[37:13] God now look it will take
[37:18] somebody with a
[37:23] [Music]
[37:24] reflection comes
[37:29] now now now you can
[37:31] imagine when she saw the Lord
[37:34] Jesus you know she was trying to cover
[37:37] herself you
[37:40] know she was a
[37:43] prostitute and trying to pull
[37:46] down and all
[37:52] [Music]
[37:55] that amen
[37:58] because inside of
[38:09] that when
[38:11] Jesus was
[38:14] expressed before the the
[38:18] Pharisees they call him the king of the
[38:23] Demons he says it is
[38:25] because
[38:27] they had nothing in them to make a
[38:35] contact it is just like if you phone
[38:42] somebody
[38:49] without there's no
[38:53] contact so he end
[38:57] this
[38:58] woman because she had a
[39:04] representation
[39:07] little little
[39:10] Stone she came there and and of course
[39:13] she was ashamed of
[39:18] herself trying to cover
[39:25] herself
[39:27] but she said
