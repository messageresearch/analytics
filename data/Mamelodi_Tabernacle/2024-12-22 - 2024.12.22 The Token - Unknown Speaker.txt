therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house amen and give me a true token amen we can be seated amen we thank God for the scriptures which were written some thousands of years ago which were L some thousands years ago yeah okay hallelujah amen God bless you my brothers amen yeah can you can you hear me no it's fine now we can okay so these scriptures were written a thousand years ago and time as time goes on and the Revelation comes clearer it becomes better book amen amen hallelujah hallelujah uh those of you of you who are in the [Music] universities whether you're studying medicine or engineering or whatever you're studying go take a book which was WR in 1960s you find has got it's not useful anymore as time goes on it becomes useless the things of Earth the things of Earth as time goes they become useless amen amen hallelujah amen as I was coming here uh um brother a brother was driving me I saw a toota 1992 was the car today is just a match box the only thing you can do better with it is to make buckets out of it but yet in 1992 my brother my sister tell you when 3 lit came out people were thinking that they had the the car but today is nothing so as we are men we should know our achievements one day somebody call them nothing only God's achievements when they come time they become better and better and better hallelujah amen because everything which God made you think that it's a super it's a super thing I saw a picture one [Music] day of a Falon of a FAL somebody was trying to take the picture of the and he wanted to realize that the way the f is moded the most expensive now which is a B2 bomber exactly as if it's a FAL the most expensive plane is like a which God created millions of years ago and look at the wings of the new PL going towards the wings of of an eego so man will always improve himself God is always perfect word isect today the token has been given to us amen amen so how did the people get a token uh thank you very much for those of you who are good artists a lot of artists especially the those of the Adventist calling they are very good artists when they p a picture of a token they they paint a very good picture they put a door and then they put a ready paint there that's a token all of us say that is that's a token oh my brother that's not a token amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen there are just a few of us here who have ever killed a cow how many have ever killed a God bless you my brother God bless you my brother God bless you my brother God bless you my brother amen my brother if you have k the cow and you take the blood and put it on a tree will it look clean no all the FES will come and be on the there hallelujah amen so what they do they remove the fers and put it blood there no no no the there as well amen amen when Abraham Abraham killed AB the the sacrifice for God AB he was busy chasing the CR chasing the what never came until he stopped and all the crows came to eat all the VES came to eat that's when God came those green things of yours God doesn't like them the token has never been acceptable has never been clean before that's why the Egyptians didn't apply it because they saw it it was dirty that's why your people today are not applying it because it was dirty the token has always been a dirty place and smart people can't be there that's why the smart people are not in here to doesn't good you look de when you in a token token they don't like your skirts they don't like your hair they don't like token the toen will not be acceptable until the uh the Bishops will put in their houses put to because the token doesn't look good to the Egyptians they refused it because it was horrible it was shameful the token is never universally accept toen amen hallelujah amen when God is going to pick people for his service and you find the whole world is looking is accepting them stand again sorry check your stand again those who are talken are not acceptable amen amen amen if was if I was preaching token and each and every Church wants me to preach to them whate ofk because the token is repulsive if I was going to preach a token there should be people who Hur you for nothing token they hated Jesus they hated John the Baptist why are they liking you it is a token token when it's a token token you be a Target go and try to to tell the people the message at your office you see the Muslims and the Dutch and the word they will be on one side and you'll be alone they will forget their differences they say you you think you are the only one we know you but in there there will be Pentecostal whatever Church you think just just try to share the message you see how people buch together the token hallelujah amen amen amen no was it attractive no the only one everybody refus to be they they call it all the names oh like this like that amen amen amen amen when you talk about the the the uh the the only house which they could be accomodated on was the house ofab all the mions were closed they wouldn't even take them in the token token yes my brother they had the token they couldn't be accepted in the mions accepted by the Bishops accepted by everyone a little woman of bad reputation is the only one who accepted them the token token so where the token is an attractive place it's a place which everybody else refuses to go from the beginning has never wanted a talken to be attractive the token is supposed to be believed by revelation and you can see when entain God's people who told her to look for a token Revelation it was only by level realize amen amen learn how to ask for a token in the same job which they condemning her because in her job she was looking for a token in the same job which people were condemning there was a revelation which was a tree of life because been other woman she would not have asked for a true token Hallelujah am so talk about the woman of the amen amen amen amen so the token token how do you receive a token if you're going to receive a token it be the same in the beginning what happened Israel had to First accept a prophet Moses Moses gave them a token had to First receive the messengers it was The Messengers gave the token token so first of all you have to receive the messenger the messenger tell you how to apply token amen amen Ruth how to accept Naomi first a woman who has lost her husband children lost everything and you a girl you want to hang around that woman I'm very sure that one was not a South [Laughter] African that notth afri no I'm very sure I'm very sure and also was not a malan because we malawians we don't like hanging around poor people we don't don't I don't want to cheat you I don't wants in if you poor they going to after you we don't like that but now look where the token is brother and sister look where the token is God does not visit those flash FL things God is hidden God's red gift comes in a clothes that's how God gift comes it doesn't come in a a jacket bought from bat or or whatever God's Gift comes wed ining clothes that's how the token comes amen Beau so God's gift when God wants to give you a gift careful because uh in Malawi um there's a wedding so they bring a a plastic a cup like this one which is plastic they will in a leaf so when they coming hey you think that bringing very nice thing when you open find a plastic made in China the Chinese are not very busy what they're making they're not very busy there amen but that's what how God's gift is like careful with God's Gift always Beed in things which are not acceptable and only people with a revelation will be able to catch up to that hallelujah amen amen amen so what happened when John yeah if you go to uh first chapter of John 45 John chapter 45 yes h no no first John 1 vers 45 ver5 amen yes verse 45 so Philip find naani and said unto him we have found him of whom Moses and the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth nazare the son of Joseph yourself amen amen well Nathaniel said whatever he wanted to say but these people they already were discussing about this person they were already in tune waiting for God's gift to alive when Nathaniel comes to Jesus as soon as he's aling Jesus says behold an Israelite amen amen in whom there's no but when Jesus is with the Pharisees they calling him names did he prophesy on them no no if if you can be calling your pastor names can he pray for you to get healed no from the begin for you receive the blessing first of all you have to receive the One S Philip phip and nathel received Jesus even before they saw Jesus that's why as soon as they coming inment breaks for Hallelujah when he came he went to when Andrew Andrew on 1 John 4:41 vers 41 the same one just go to 41 41 amen yes when he find his own brother Simon he said to him we have found him look these people are not talking about whatever the Pharisees were talking about Jesus are talking good things Jesus chist they are dead but this is the Messiah it's only when they were very sure that this gift is a gift of a messiah that's where the gift of the Messiah operated on them that's why brother say Do you believe I am his Prophet oh oh sorry sorry sorry h a prophet is a like uh a prophet is like just know that is an unbeliever when he meets somebody who believes he just says do you believe I'm God's Prophet well he never struggled to explain to that person the message when comes to says you believe on God's prophet he start explaining to you you are an unbeliever nothing is going to happen as soon as he arrived at you and he says do you believe on God's Prophet you have a hard trouble he didn't even to tell him that I've seen you are a Believer AC but those who refused you start telling them how what is the prophet Propet messenger for them amen amen amen go and P and drink part of it and see with you good well why do you want the message to be diluted until you understand it you have to take the whole taet amen amen until your pastor should explain to you you know if I am your pastor then I can pray for you and you can be all right if you can accept me as your pastor you never get amen amen because somebody who get wants to get well he will come running amen amen amen amen so when Jesus saw Simon coming IM said thou Simon son of from now your name be changed you'll be called immediately he didn't even ask him would you like you me to change your you call him Peter today Peter the Lord changed his name Simon to Peter is Peter in English who changed his name am he said here amen thou shall be called hallelujah amen what if uh uh he was an unbeliever that would have been a struggle you know this name it was given to me by my uncle and let me apply to the government if they can change the name immediately Peter caught up to the Revelation this is a messiah what he calls me that I will be amen amen so he was exposing look here Jesus never tried to expose anything about this Messiah being him being a messiah to people who didn't believe him amen that's why when when Philip was calling Philip knowing that is a Believer he told him one thing wait my brother just come and see as soon as he came he didn't need Phil to tell him again about that because him was a believer he CAU up with the Revelation this is the Messiah amen amen and he declared himself he said Rabbi thou are the king of [Music] Israel after just being the message he didn't have those uh things which we people are talking about you you'll be wondering are we in the message or in a political party we are supposed to be Believers a Believer shall be known by the signs and wonders not not about the way he looks like which gives advantage to somebody who looks like me look are nothing my brother you know it's a word amen say Amen everybody amen amen God does not go into looks God goes for the inside you can see outside God is looking the inside the believer inside you can condemn the outside but the inside is what God is looking at in the inside is a part of him hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen how do you know that inside of you there is God amen amen amen amen let me start again how do you know that inside of you there is God what was inside you theen there was theop hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what is the word body body amen the word body subject amen amen amen regardless of whatever anybody tells you my sister my brother if you are subject to the word you are going to heaven regardless whatever everyone tells you but you are not subject to the way there's a danger there because what we lost what Adam lost was the the Adam of genesis: 126 the one which the one who came from Heaven the one which was Adam that time was from the soil [Music] amen amen so you know soils each soil behaves the way it is amen because those of you who are agriculturist here you know before you plant anything in the soil you have to test it so South African soil even in South Africa here there are so many soils different they behave differently according to according to the which you took it from so the which God said you are going to return to the soil is a the of Genesis 2 but the one of genesis6 return back to God now what is the theop now the it's a body is what type of body subject it's a word body subject to the word amen so if our body was going to come from Heaven what will come from Heaven the word the F that's why when the Seven Seals came call them they titled because now the word in in is being restored back to man amen the F in F is the word of God in F being restored back amen amen and the Bible says behold the Tabernacle of God is with men amen now God is dwelling in men amen amen what was the sign when God visited when when when when God Vis you find brother Bram says one day he was

Believer if you are a Believer my brother if you are a Believer God will give you a s the Lord himself amen amen so what what was the sign when he came to Moses it was a burning bush Daniel was the angel Gabriel when he came to Abraham they came to give him a Paul the P of fire uh Peter thouas Nathaniel behold an Israelite there's no right am hallelujah amen hallelujah so you can see the Lord is
