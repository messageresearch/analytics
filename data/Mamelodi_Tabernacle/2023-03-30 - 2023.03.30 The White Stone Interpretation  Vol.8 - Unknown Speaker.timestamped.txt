[1:43:12] same
[1:43:16] place

[1:43:28] now we were reading together with the
[1:43:31] brothers
[1:43:35] looking an important
[1:43:38] thing of the time that we living in we
[1:43:42] are going to read such
[1:43:45] things where the servant of God shows us
[1:43:49] that that the time we are living in the
[1:43:53] book of the
[1:43:59] Revelation seven
[1:44:02] SE the seven seal or the
[1:44:09] seals have ended the New
[1:44:14] Testament Testament actually have closed
[1:44:17] the New Testament amen now I will
[1:44:19] announce to you
[1:44:21] that the
[1:44:23] Testament according to the word of the
[1:44:30] Prophet amen
[1:44:32] amen um I'm not
[1:44:35] saying you should not read the New
[1:44:39] Testament every time you read it it will
[1:44:43] still drive
[1:44:45] you
[1:44:49] to there is no place
[1:44:51] there for a son or a
[1:44:58] daughter
[1:45:00] yes you read it your place is no longer
[1:45:07] there you say he says come
[1:45:11] up and I will show you I can't show you
[1:45:16] from where you
[1:45:20] are all right amen
[1:45:27] now Revelation
[1:45:32] 21 there he also says ration
[1:45:36] 21
[1:45:38] john9 and there came unto me one of the
[1:45:41] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[1:45:44] full of the seven last plagues and
[1:45:47] talked with me saying come hither I will
[1:45:50] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:45:53] amen that's right
[1:45:57] amen uh meaning you can see the bread of
[1:46:03] Christ from a
[1:46:05] church no but he says
[1:46:10] come then I will show
[1:46:13] you because the prophet says the bride
[1:46:18] is Al and
[1:46:21] Omega amen amen now the
[1:46:26] bride he says the bride is just like the
[1:46:33] husband now you can't see the
[1:46:37] husband while failing to see the
[1:46:43] bride before you can tell me about the
[1:46:47] husband tell me about his
[1:46:51] wife so
[1:46:53] before you tell me about
[1:46:57] God H we want to
[1:46:59] know that's why it
[1:47:01] says come
[1:47:04] up brother just read that that that part
[1:47:07] there
[1:47:09] please uh you know that the scripture
[1:47:12] Revelation chapter
[1:47:14] 4 oh yeah after this I looked and behold
[1:47:19] a door was opened in heaven and the
[1:47:22] first voice which I heard was as it were
[1:47:25] of the trumpet talking with me which
[1:47:27] said come up hither and I will show the
[1:47:31] things which must be herea amen amen
[1:47:35] amen
[1:47:36] okay the door was
[1:47:40] open in
[1:47:43] heaven and the word
[1:47:45] said come
[1:47:47] up and I will show
[1:47:51] you amen amen
[1:47:55] meaning if he does not come
[1:47:58] up he will not see that
[1:48:00] thing amen that's
[1:48:03] why uh seven Church
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:08] ages talks about
[1:48:15] time shows you time now that's
[1:48:20] why say come up
[1:48:26] because when you come to
[1:48:32] seven now
[1:48:37] are meaning some people
[1:48:40] come they end up being in the
[1:48:45] seventh and that which is
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:49] time all right amen now time
[1:48:54] won't show you the seventh
[1:48:57] seene it is not that you need to be in a
[1:49:00] certain
[1:49:03] place where it is your
[1:49:08] theop
[1:49:12] active because today we have the
[1:49:16] church the message
[1:49:20] churches but there's
[1:49:23] there's also the bride of
[1:49:27] Christ Now The Message
[1:49:30] Church uh we have so many of
[1:49:34] them and they
[1:49:36] differ some say it is R
[1:49:41] some some say this and some say because
[1:49:45] they are the
[1:49:49] message but then the
[1:49:51] bride
[1:49:54] this it is God who speaks through the
[1:50:00] bride amen amen that that's the
[1:50:04] difference so I told them even somewhere
[1:50:08] in
[1:50:09] Africa that we don't belong to a message
[1:50:15] church we are the bride of
[1:50:20] Christ Alpha and Omega
[1:50:24] if the prophet of God
[1:50:27] says if he is alha
[1:50:30] and their wife is
[1:50:34] also if it is not so they are going
[1:50:40] to if the husband and the
[1:50:43] wife don't see things or one sees it
[1:50:47] like this and the other one sees it like
[1:50:51] this well they are mer
[1:50:55] naturally but they are not
[1:50:59] one talking about
[1:51:02] one that means it's one
[1:51:05] voice one
[1:51:07] Revelation that is
[1:51:09] one but one like I said one cannot
[1:51:15] divorce
[1:51:18] itself if they are they are one
[1:51:23] how can one divorce
[1:51:27] itself that means it is impossible for
[1:51:33] divorce they
[1:51:36] are if you are one with
[1:51:39] Christ there is no
[1:51:41] place of you falling
[1:51:47] away you are
[1:51:49] one and your marriage they didn't your
[1:51:53] your marriage with
[1:51:55] Christ they didn't start on the fourth
[1:51:57] of
[1:52:00] April
[1:52:02] no h it started back
[1:52:06] then you know the prophet says we'll
[1:52:10] read
[1:52:12] that like the seventh
[1:52:16] seal it started back
[1:52:20] there we'll read that the
[1:52:23] will it started back
[1:52:25] there now the people who were not
[1:52:29] there they can't understand it they
[1:52:33] can't hear
[1:52:34] it amen because it started back
[1:52:38] there that's why he comes and say you
[1:52:42] have from
[1:52:45] your because the has no
[1:52:49] beginning it came from the seven colors
[1:52:52] of the
[1:52:57] and he
[1:53:01] says is a body subject to the
[1:53:06] way am amen amen meaning a child of
[1:53:12] God cannot do
[1:53:15] anything without hearing from God
[1:53:18] first amen it say theop is subject is a
[1:53:24] body
[1:53:26] subject
[1:53:28] to
[1:53:30] the when the word
[1:53:34] speaks it speaks in
[1:53:39] you
[1:53:41] like the the prophet said
[1:53:45] this that that
[1:53:49] woman when brother Bram spoke to that
[1:53:52] woman
[1:53:56] and about
[1:53:58] squirrels and that woman said
[1:54:02] brother this is nothing but the
[1:54:06] truth and brother Bram
[1:54:10] says it is because she didn't say it
[1:54:14] from
[1:54:15] here amen
[1:54:18] listen the woman believes that brother
[1:54:24] Bram H God has created
[1:54:29] squ when brother
[1:54:32] spoke and God said how many you
[1:54:36] want amen you know the
[1:54:39] partners just like Adam and
[1:54:44] God God would create something and sent
[1:54:48] it down to
[1:54:49] Adam amen amen amen and there is
[1:54:53] not when it was the way from God to
[1:54:59] Adam no one could correct the other
[1:55:04] one they spoke with one
[1:55:09] way amen amen amen if God created
[1:55:13] creates something and he brings it to
[1:55:17] Adam amen amen Adam Adam will exactly
[1:55:22] say what God has already
[1:55:30] in you see
[1:55:33] amen now when that woman when she said
[1:55:39] brother what you have said is nothing
[1:55:42] but the
[1:55:44] truth now brother says it is because she
[1:55:48] didn't say it from
[1:55:51] here
[1:55:52] amen you know the pre the
[1:55:55] gospel which should be preached by the
[1:55:59] bride not preach from
[1:56:03] here because if it is from here then you
[1:56:07] have H
[1:56:08] somebody preing
[1:56:11] that but it should be your
[1:56:15] husband God to the
[1:56:19] bride all right amen h

[2:16:25] subject preached by my
[2:16:28] Prophet brother B brother amen amen amen

[2:16:45] amen the
[2:16:47] more I hate that
[2:16:51] the more I spoke the name of the prophet
[2:16:55] of
[2:16:59] God I spoke about
[2:17:01] it so for the people to know
[2:17:04] that as I was speaking to a certain
[2:17:09] brother no it's a
[2:17:12] sister she was at my house there that
[2:17:17] you will never come right with God
[2:17:22] we were talking about a thing in this
[2:17:28] way when God
[2:17:32] speaks even right now as we are here
[2:17:36] together some will hear
[2:17:40] God then they will leave this place
[2:17:43] without any
[2:17:45] question
[2:17:48] blessed why because the word has found
[2:17:53] its
[2:17:56] [Applause]
[2:17:57] place the
[2:17:59] word if the word that you are listening
[2:18:05] to if it goes to the
[2:18:09] Head then you have not had God
[2:18:16] speak the word of
[2:18:18] God don't come to the Head
[2:18:24] the the word of
[2:18:26] God is from
[2:18:30] the we'll read that as I'm closing
[2:18:34] here it's true that you have heard what
[2:18:38] you hear is what you have
[2:18:42] he what you see what we have have
[2:18:48] seen it's nothing new to you
[2:18:53] you will you can only
[2:18:56] receive a predestinated
[2:18:59] person can only receive what he has
[2:19:08] his amen that's
[2:19:12] why Here
[2:19:14] Comes
[2:19:16] um
[2:19:19] disciples
[2:19:21] they follow the lord Jesus
[2:19:25] Christ until he said
[2:19:30] something and they
[2:19:32] said it's hard to hear
[2:19:49] this
[2:19:52] now there's two people
[2:19:56] here this
[2:20:00] one he
[2:20:02] hears with his ears this one this
[2:20:06] one he
[2:20:09] from we read
[2:20:11] it
[2:20:14] will uh your your your your hearing
[2:20:19] faculty
[2:20:23] if you are
[2:20:25] predestinated it's
[2:20:29] your amen
[2:20:32] amen as we are seated like this one is
[2:20:36] listening
[2:20:38] with the other one with
[2:20:42] this now these people are not
[2:20:46] together but they are listening
[2:20:49] both the other
[2:20:52] one is by
[2:20:54] the Now by
[2:20:56] theop he is listening to something he
[2:20:59] has had
[2:21:03] already because it says
[2:21:08] so that's why the prophet says that
[2:21:15] woman she said
[2:21:19] mesiah right let me
[2:21:21] repeat I
[2:21:24] know the first
[2:21:27] thing she didn't say I was at the church
[2:21:33] and the pastor preached about the coming
[2:21:43] Messiah know that person that's a person
[2:21:47] who has H from her feel
[2:21:56] because you hear this one
[2:22:00] saying baptism is in the name of the
[2:22:03] Lord Jesus
[2:22:06] Christ you go
[2:22:08] to the next
[2:22:15] person he says hey I don't understand
[2:22:17] this
[2:22:19] baptism pastor says when you bapti you
[2:22:22] baptized name of the father name of the
[2:22:25] son of the Holy Ghost I was talking
[2:22:29] to asking about
[2:22:32] it all right then he goes to a a church
[2:22:36] set
[2:22:39] Church uh they
[2:22:42] say uh the Bible
[2:22:45] says you are
[2:22:47] baptized be baptized in the name of the
[2:22:51] Lord Jesus
[2:22:54] Christ then there two things
[2:22:58] now if it is from the
[2:23:02] the then you are you will be baptized in
[2:23:05] the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:23:08] Christ if it is from a
[2:23:11] denomination which it is from the Bible
[2:23:15] School you will be
[2:23:17] baptized not in Christ
[2:23:21] amen amen in in the
[2:23:24] name which we don't know that
[2:23:27] name amen the name of the father Son and
[2:23:31] Holy
[2:23:32] Ghost is not the
[2:23:36] names is the
[2:23:39] name now father that's his
[2:23:43] office as he
[2:23:45] came
[2:23:47] father son he came to die for
[2:23:52] us he took the form of
[2:23:55] man he was called
[2:23:58] son God am and the Holy Ghost
[2:24:03] also when after he finished his course
[2:24:06] with the
[2:24:09] disciples he went back to
[2:24:12] heaven in order to come as the
[2:24:17] holy but the same
[2:24:21] the same
[2:24:24] person now that's why it says baptize
[2:24:31] them now I was talking to a
[2:24:36] sister I
[2:24:38] said it is in the
[2:24:41] name the

[2:29:19] to
[2:29:21] he say only God
[2:29:25] knows now later he comes and
[2:29:28] say this Rapture is
[2:29:31] close without the seven
[2:29:38] seal how can the Rapture comes without
[2:29:41] the seven
[2:29:43] seed look at
[2:29:45] those now that's
[2:29:48] why uh
[2:29:51] what I have
[2:29:53] received I cannot exchange for something
[2:29:59] else
[2:30:01] Revelation the ministry that comes by
[2:30:04] Revelation is rolling
[2:30:09] on but there's a
[2:30:13] Ministry from another Canal
[2:30:18] head
[2:30:22] all right
[2:30:24] amen now it's two different things
[2:30:28] here if it is because brother
[2:30:32] says he speaks of the new
[2:30:39] Soul uh we'll read it it is in the
[2:30:45] C the new
[2:30:48] Soul this
[2:30:51] for you to receive the seven seventh
[2:30:59] seal you're going to realize
[2:31:04] that you are not getting it from an old
[2:31:09] old school or
[2:31:13] so the prophet
[2:31:16] say you receive a New Soul
[2:31:25] because the seventh
[2:31:27] SE that's when
[2:31:30] God
[2:31:32] brings now not
[2:31:34] new to
[2:31:38] you God is not sending you an old
[2:31:45] thing
[2:31:47] no if it says the new one
[2:31:51] that's when it is now that
[2:31:55] revelation of what you have
[2:31:58] heard amen amen am because every
[2:32:03] age we are receiving what we have
[2:32:08] he if if you didn't hear
[2:32:11] that and you you are receiving something
[2:32:14] you didn't
[2:32:18] receive amen amen that won't work for
[2:32:21] you
[2:32:22] because we are talking about
[2:32:28] eternity now if you are
[2:32:32] Eternal you live by by by this Eternal
[2:32:37] Word of
[2:32:38] [Music]
[2:32:40] God Eternal Word canot even be
[2:32:45] corrected it is
[2:32:48] eternal and one once you have received
[2:32:51] eternal
[2:32:52] life nothing can change
[2:32:56] you you don't join a
[2:32:59] church because you have you got eternal
[2:33:03] [Applause]
[2:33:04] life it's just
[2:33:08] Eternal that's why when those those I
[2:33:11] met those Brothers G and
[2:33:15] so I said to them to him you are my
[2:33:23] Heil
[2:33:26] away but yet we are
[2:33:29] one now what makes us
[2:33:33] one this new
[2:33:35] Commission
[2:33:37] because we'll see it you should be in
[2:33:40] the
[2:33:43] pyramid the white stone was in the
[2:33:48] pyramid not in the church
[2:33:50] and brother bam that's why he was put
[2:33:53] into the
[2:33:55] pyramid that's where the white
[2:34:00] stone what is the white
[2:34:03] St all right amen we look
[2:34:07] at you two have the right a white
[2:34:12] stone in
[2:34:16] you because you don't have any faculty
[2:34:21] but we are going to look into
[2:34:24] that where the Prophet
[2:34:28] said H you see now we are here to
[2:34:33] worship
[2:34:38] God when I was still at the with the
[2:34:40] Assemblies of
[2:34:44] God we were sometimes invited by
[2:34:48] some from
[2:34:50] the other
[2:34:52] denominations and to go at this time
[2:34:55] like this time of the what you call this
[2:34:59] time
[2:35:03] eers some people they decide to go to
[2:35:13] swim go to this
[2:35:16] beach
[2:35:18] amen
[2:35:23] we're talking about the prophet when he
[2:35:24] says
[2:35:28] Sunday we Sunday are again the first day
[2:35:31] the first
[2:35:33] day that is
[2:35:36] Sunday
[2:35:39] Sunday you don't go get
[2:35:43] engaged in any
[2:35:48] other first
[2:35:52] day you hear one
[2:35:58] says this Sunday we are actually paying
[2:36:03] out according to the word of
[2:36:07] the that
[2:36:11] person has
[2:36:13] disrespected the first
[2:36:16] day all
[2:36:18] right hey
[2:36:21] I can hear
[2:36:23] it first day the first
[2:36:28] day cour is kicked
[2:36:31] out then then the marriage comes
[2:36:34] in why
[2:36:38] sometimes that's why fall apart
[2:36:44] because the Resurrection
[2:36:48] Day our
[2:36:53] now I also listen from my
[2:36:57] Prophet the first day Mary
[2:37:01] Magdalene didn't go
[2:37:03] for she
[2:37:06] because the
[2:37:10] Christ
[2:37:13] already
[2:37:18] enteru enter
[2:37:21] when when did Christ come into you
[2:37:27] before he was there all the
[2:37:29] time but when the time
[2:37:32] arrived then he came
[2:37:35] in but you you always
[2:37:42] was being his
[2:37:45] child before it could even be visible
[2:37:49] amen before you were
[2:37:51] born amen amen he knew you he saw
[2:37:57] you that's why the prophet says WR woman
[2:38:01] was waiting for that
[2:38:03] way to be made
[2:38:06] flesh mean all this
[2:38:09] time before there was
[2:38:11] time she was in the
[2:38:14] message the message was
[2:38:18] in
[2:38:20] amen then that's why the prophet
[2:38:22] says she knew about it she was waiting
[2:38:26] for it to be made
[2:38:30] flesh so as now to
[2:38:35] speak she has known
[2:38:37] about
[2:38:39] Mah and when he he has come he
[2:38:44] will because she has seen that
[2:38:47] already she was waiting for for the
[2:38:50] Messiah to come and
[2:38:53] manifest the thing that she
[2:38:56] has why the seven
