to be amongst the children of god here in this house [Music] [Music] it's so wonderful to come together us to come and give he planted us here who is richer but we are in a threefold emperor do you know that that's why the devil has tried all what he could try and they could not do anything because we are threefold even yesterday when we were coming this way we were battling regularly we were fighting can i tell you something um so we were fighting even yesterday [Music] [Music] foreign that i'm going to open a scripture just for uh you know when we arrive at the hotel there's always starters we also have some statuses but the whole thing that matters that we have arrived in this time it is a time that started before and it will end up that's right if we were to reverse because the bible says [Music] daughters of god transfiguration i am going to comply to take the time as it is given to me okay don't [Music] the first thing we have i want to read two scriptures and it came to pass about an eight days after these things he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his remnant was white and lester and behold they talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and speak of his disease which he should accomplish at amen when you [Music] after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up heather and i will show their things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne [Music] foreign god bless you essay let me ask our just a way of prayer our most gracious heavenly father we like to thank you lord this afternoon the bible says father you used to come fro from the caring of eden lord to check your son and the father one day you'll find him that he was no longer father in the place father we'd like to thank you that lord there is a way the sword that his lord is taking us back and the father as the pastor is standing there lord you will have to pray for him this is the way to my father that was there before lord if you have said father that the pride is coming twice because we are alpha in america and the father thank you lord for leading us lord he's leading us to that a new jerusalem blessing my father is standing lord behind the pulpit he's the angel of this hour and the father we pray for him lord nothing by enemies that shall hate him because my father he is coming is coming from thee and the lord is gonna come go back to thee father we like to thank you lord that father you will work we will talk with your word father and we are here listening lord and we adhere to your weight give you the glory and honor in the most wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen amen i wonder if our pastors were introduced you know brother branham says pastor will see you through how we cannot vote respect your pastor [Applause] you may be seated for a while i have been given time and i'm going to respect and do according to the time given okay nothing went wrong and when god comes to a man he comes to his heart [Music] because if we go to mount transfiguration when moses elijah and the lord jesus christ said of how we will be re-introduced to the messiah and because they were blinded who weren't available but the they will preach to them brother branham says they will preach the same message that we preach and they will be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ as i read until that hour the message is dealing was now dealing with the seventh church age malaysia is it is not here with me the brother will get it from you if you can get me the book of the rapture i have it in my back there in my books no brother says is that is my prophet says he speaks of i don't know is the brother back here if he can the book is there are you there my brother it is somewhere or in the back it is there or otherwise it is somewhere right around here but i've got it i mean it is there [Music] um to your book it is marked yes let me write in this book forgive [Music] there is something here unless the same way okay all right god bless you this one says he starts by asking is he didn't i'll keep on watching that book data [Music] oh of life of life um by god watch them from mount transfiguration until they appear down there as the eunuchs is nations elijah off of the gentiles so it will make it elijah it is the spirit of elijah the spirit let me come down to this now here i was talking about this book he said what did you believe after he died and resurrected is so now here is it i was i was still with this book now this is the gentiles uh you don't rejoice when somebody tells you that their seals are open when you see them when he was no longer a mediator we made you'll see the ministry what we are going to talk about after he has left the intercessory box that's he will be fighting at that time [Music] what it says yes that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life to preach the message from the spoken that which you have not come here [Music] that's why there's no confusion you're confused you don't start today which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the weight of life amen brother branham says he will hear from your father those because he knows [Music] [Applause] that's why yes about too far that's why now you who have fought we're not only there and they have one will continue to win [Applause] [Music] i [Music] when you are preaching let me read to you this the regular valencia so remind me quarter past five is it quarter first contact is containing right this book every time where i go i take this book with me okay that is the day of your redemption it is not revealed to everybody it is revealed to those who were with him before the foundation of the world fell about [Applause] the beloved prophet speaks here [Music] is your name is already there do you know how the shitty little foul he doesn't look at you he looks wet brother i will look upon is he sees you in christ oh wonderful wonderful that represented that predestination or redemption but brother is it still am i still on time god bless you but the first thing here is the first thing this is the name that had been slain of the world to his seventh ancient messenger and then so if you are in there hold the phone you open up when the book is open instead of being confusing twice send [Applause] [Music] the seven angels came for god all the angels came and took me [Music] um [Applause] is [Music] and he calls that angel the angel with the seventh scene if the rapture don't take me tonight tomorrow foreign that's why it is called the garden of the country called [Music] drove them out of the east gate because [Music] [Music] you remember they ate from the tree of knowledge these two trees [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] revelation what does she tell me to do amen you know if you you god will never accept you but he will accept you [Applause] fruits imperfections again sent to god take it don't leave it that's the way i wash it the last one here says i finished it [Music] you see what happened i'm repeating this thing for a course he said it's it's [Music] [Music] the answer [Applause] because that's where the name is [Music] if
