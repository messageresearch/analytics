paid our conference fee hallelujah hallelujah we have paid deposit for the accommodation and Catering this year we are not going to allow people coming during the conference with money to enlist for catering we tried it last year it didn't work for us so we advise everybody to pay the deposit for catering we also realized that inside the premises of the conference there is no place where they sell food so in case you want to buy food you have to go outside the premises of the conference and that is also risky because you may be targeted by criminals we had a number of incident incidences last year so we advise Believers to avoid saying during the break to avoid during the break to go and say they going to buy food some they want to walk to the garage and they being targeted so we advise everyone to enlist for catering hallelujah hallelujah at the moment I'm sure we are all preparing to finalize our payment God bless you just to remind the Believers about parking parking H we have requested about two elderly men [Music] to watch over the car outsite so avoid the criminals targeting our cars so the little that we give for parking we give those elderly men outside just to say Thank you so we humbly ask you to pay for the parking H we prefer that you bring the cash to pay to pay for the parking some say they deposited into the bank but the preference is for you to come and pay for the parking every Sunday I hope it's clear may the Lord richly bless you can we just say shalom to those that are streaming Shalom amen amen H we have a message from our Elder Reed Gabriel

that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands

from verse let's read from verse 16 then uh to verse [Music] 18 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words let's read again methew 3 verse 13 17 from verse 13 to to 17 amen then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbet him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and come as thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lightning upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased let's close our eyes dear heavenly father thank you for this time you privileged US with it be with us be with with your children be with me and my brother here use our voice Lord we pray to convey your message to your children we pray and ask in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen as I also greet my pastor you may take your seats I believe he is with us listening I'm also happy to preach to him I didn't think I will preach to him I refused when he was asking me to preach perhaps it was that L him to be sick so that they can come and preach because I would um as we have said last about the second coming of the lord The Rapture and then we have spoken about it that we have got the first we have got three comings we have uh the first coming was for him to come and redeem us and the second coming is for him to come and take us home which is Rapture and the thirth coming is when he when he will be coming with us which is Revelation chapter 19 coming with us into [Music] Millennium you see people mix this comings because they don't understand the Rapture they believe that the Rapture is when we go people go to judgment and we also had the three raptures we had three raptures in the Old Testament the first one was that of Enoch and the second was that of Elijah and the third was of Jesus Christ it was three raptures in the Old Testament then we have got we will have three raptures in the new test then we have got already two we have got already one the one of those old Saints who resurrected when Jesus resurrected and the Bible says they were they have been seen by people and they were raptured with him he rul with him when he was rising up and when he rise up to heaven and they rose up with him it was the first [Music] first in the New Testament and the second one will be the Rapture for us that will the second in the New Testament and the third one will be Revelation chapter 11 of those two witnesses that one will be the third [Music] Rapture now we are talking about the our Rapture which is called the second coming of the Lord and we have said to understand the second coming you must first understand his first coming and we have said prophets prophesied about his first his first coming until the last prophet Malachi prophesied about that first coming prophesying about the God sending his Messenger to prepare the way before him and prophesying about him coming to his Temple we have said you see it was it was very difficult for people to believe to understand what type of a temple was it because God has already commanded Moses to build a temple because he wanted to dwell with them it was the Commandment of God for Moses to build the temple and Moses built the temple when the prophet Malachi says when he says God is coming to his Temple they believe that the only Temple that God would come to it was that Temple which was built by Moses because it was the Commandment of God they were there in the temple Waiting for God to come in but God was coming into a different temp Bible says that coming was was a press it wasn't just a coming because while they were waiting and singing in the temple Vision made the angel we have talked about that then there there was the the meeting of the Angel and the vision and there was pregnancy and there was B there was growth then until we get to methew chapter 3 methew chapter 3 it was John there and John was his forun when he was there baptizing people the temple came which was Jesus when the temple came there then John was looking at the temple and he refused he said I'm not with to baptize you you must baptize me that was the meeting let me just read for you some he says that was the reason when Jesus walked in the water John looked over and he seen that dve coming down he said Behold the Lamb of God there he is he is come he is the one that will take away the sin of the world Jesus walked right straight into the water to him them two eyes of John made the two eyes of Jesus they were second cousins by flesh they were second [Music] cousins Mary and Elizabeth were first cousin their eyes met one another there was God than his prophet amen standing there and his Prophet who can believe that a man come into the water they say it's there was a man in the water Bing people they say he was the prophet of John said I have need to be baptized of [Music] thee why Come Thou to me Jesus said suffer it to be to be so now but remember thus it behoved us to fulfill all righteousness why did John do it because he was the sacrifice John was a prophet he knew that the sacrifices going to be swashed before it is [Music] presented he suffered him and he baptized him when he had when he had the heaven open oh my that D come down upon him a voice said this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in go the God himself saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in God and man becoming one [Music] God coming into his Temple through seven Church ages he was there preparing his Temple his second coming must be a process also because here it was the Fulfillment of Mal chter 3 it was God who was spoken by Malachi who who promised in Malachi that he will come to his temper now he was coming to his temp it was his first coming you see it was a process even now it his second coming it must be a processen it mustn't it must just be like that a proes but people won't agree or see [Music] it but it must be a process he says now you see the seals when he was in historial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book we know through seven church he was imediator we know when he was immediated there in each Church age there was m m and women who were part of this artion because in each age God send a messenger because to believe him to be his child is when you could recognize in your age the one God has sent then you become his child there this is the Simplicity of the word of God because people would go to the mountain even in Jesus time they asked him what can we do to do your work he said to do my work is when you believe the one he has sent but they couldn't understand they want to believe Jehovah that is how people are doing even now people they want to believe Jesus they want to be the children of Jesus they want to be one with Jesus but they don't know what God say in each age God has one who he has sent and he want people to recognize if the people have recognize the one he has sent those who have recognized they what we call Total [Applause] settlement those who have recognized the one who has sent even in Esther's time those Visions failed because after they've been taught that they are going to meet the king and they must get into that house to get something to put on they thought they will use their own minds there there was a man there called her guy who was the the king seven who knows the king if you want to please the king you must take all what this man told you in age there was a messenger there those who believe that messenger those who have recognized that messenger and believe the message of that messenger they were part of this group they were part of the group of the Rapture Hallelujah let me say my brother they part of us amen they believe their message their message was enough for them that was the evidence that they have got the spirit of God Joshua and Kaleb they had a they had another spirit so they could believe the one God but there was go and that and there respectable man but they couldn't see the one God they sent they know this man is Moses because they like that spirit let me when he was in his medori work back there during seven Church redeeming someday he comes forth to get this book that he has red all that is in this book will be him for that is the that is the believer the words in the book and the word is him all that is in that he come forth for this book for Redemption whose names are written on that book the condition of the world when he was SL as 10 we see the lamb take has taken the boook now because it has done its medial work through seven Church ages in each age there was part of the Rapture then we call them the sleeping bride the sleeping they were there and they will wake up we shall read them when we go off then at the end this L took that book because All Through the Ages he was doing that Redemption but when the ages has come to an end then we see 10 you see the lamb coming down with the book in his [Music] hand are you together with us with one foot on the land and one foot on the sea coming down now listen this angel came down from heaven the the other seven angels of the seven Church AG Messengers this Angel all the message is finished this seven Angel WS up the whole thing this Angel comes down not to the Earth he is he is he isn't a man from the earth as The Messengers to the church ages this is this is finished in other words the seven Church ages are finished but this Angel brings the next announcement an angel means a messenger he comes down from heaven clothed in that pillar of light CL the Clown with a rainbow over his head and a rainbow is a covenant this Angel was Christ with one food on the land and one food on the so that time will be no more where are we at brothers and what is all what is all of this about the other Angels were messengers of the Earth by this Angel to he said to the angel of the Church [Music] of messengers of the earth men Messengers and so forth to the churches this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the Mysteries is all finished when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more seven Thunders through their voices what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapture fa when this one is coming down with a boo in his there was another one on earth here and we read Revelation 10 we read verse 7 there when 1 verse4 comes down 10:7 was on Earth but let me read here are you together with me let me read he says here in this book preach when the seals are broke mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming 10: 1 to4 when is's coming down this one 10: when this one of 10 ver1 to4 vers 1 to 4 1 to when he is coming down this one of 10 ver7 was on Amen are you together with me the prophet says so just he said just as John was giving his message the same time the Messiah come in these days John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him are you together with us John was a forun when this one come he was for running his first coming what what did the angel said to brother BR what did the angel say to brother BR the angel said as John has forun my message will forun my second that's why the prophet says this one because he was a for he was here on Earth when this one this one was bring another announcement because those ones were over because the seven Church Ages were over because there was a stone now and Stone was [Applause] theone he said he's bring another announcement this is it was his second coming because it is a process he he prophesied because Paul was a prophet in second in first Thessalonians Paul was prophesying what was happening in our time it was a process then now we are at the end of that process are you together with us because now he said the Lord himself shall ascend from heaven with a shout voice [Music] and he is doing all these three when he is [Music] descending shout a message going forth F bringing forth the bright is the message those who died before they are waiting for us he says here the messenger bringing the message because the shout is a message you can't have a message without the messenger the shout is a message the shout is a message then there is a messenger and if there is a messenger a messeng of someone is caring a message and if he's caring a message he's caring a message to somebody and this message is not the his is taking the message from someone and bring it to someone amen he is important this messenger is important when he is carrying the message when he has dropped the message he is no more important what is important now the message he has brought and all the attention now is in the messenger not the messenger because he has brought the message just like was a he was bringing re he brought Rea to Isaac when he brought re to Isaac his work was over now all things now were now looking at Rebeca because he was the one who was brought now all eyes now are in the bride because the prophet said here let me read it for you he says one night I was seeking the lot the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and right as I I grabs my pent right the spirit his Spirit gave me a message for the church I wanted to bring it to you it has to do with the we and the Bri but I want to read something in the middle of the message you must he said go told him take your p and write this message is to the bride he said now here is the secret of this who was saying this it was the spirit of God telling the prophet he say here is the here is the secret of this the weight is in the bread as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants to be done with the way she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus say the Lord then the weight is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and water it comes to full harest saving his purpose this is what the prophet said he said now the word is in the bre this is what is happening now the shout is is a message calling the bride together for the Rapture because the Rapture is only for the bride the message is for the it's not for everybody as the Rapture is not for every the Rapture is for the bride now the Rapture is only this Rapture that we are talking about is only for the bride remember the Bible said and the rest of the Dead lived not for Thousand Years this great Rapture if there is no Rapture friends where are we at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be it will be only for the elected the elected lady the bride in the day that the Bri in this day that is pulled out the church and the Very Way Church means the called out on the bride the Rapture is for the bride if you are not the member of the Bride forget he's Gathering them together at a place gather together in the place and that is called the bright [Music] age because we have said we after when this one comes down is bring another announcement because these Church ages are finished there must be another age about this age where the announcement of this one is coming to that amen not everybody will understand he says here now with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that is Promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age it for tells us the author has before done this we wait to see him do it again what the time is it that we are living in what time is it that we are living like a calendar you look at the calendar to find what day or the year you are living and you look at God's Bible to see what age we are living in we are not living in the midle AG Baptist age we are living in the bright age the calling and bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised he promised to do it we are living in a we are we are not living in a Pentecost we are living in age we are not living in the Methodist age we are not living we are living in another age we are living up on here to the bright age the calling out of the church the shout the calling out of the church getting it together for the rapture that is the age that we are living in now so my honest opinion that is the truth this where we are living the Bible says where the ccass is the will GA that is the place where the the bride is Ging because the cus is the way and if the way the Cass is the way it's not only the way it's the weight of the hour it's the weight of your hour in each Church age it was there was the car and the sced there even in this age where the carus is the Engish will get are you together with us if you know that you are a blessed one let me read something here amen God willing let me read if I can read it if I don't see it pass because perhaps we shall come back God willing because this is a process he say it be so close it will deceive the very elect it is possible this not what I want to read but me let me read something here all right it says here where the carass is there the Eagles will gather where the carass killing is will gather the fresh meat the weight of the season the Eagles will gather there but when it is rotten the VES will swam to e not the Eagles the Eagles will gather where the carass is where the C is where the man the mans fresh will together that is the manner for the day amen amen that is the place where eagles meet the bride is gathered and is feeding on the B of the son of man the carass are you together the carass is The Bu of the son of man let me read for it here let me run amen what was is said notice the very day when the messenger I not what I want to read here let me read something here all right here is it I want to know I want I want you to be sure let me read in the middle he says here it wasn't me the seventh angel it wasn't me the seventh it was the manifestation of the son of man it it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that unfolded it is not the man is God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the he is the one that you are feeding you are not feeding on a man a man and his way will F the shout is calling the bread together so that they can come and eat so that they can have energy to fly because we are ready to fly at any time we must have food which we eat will enable us to F he said he said yeah he is the one that you are feeding on you are not feeding on a man man and his weight will fil but are feeding on unfailing weight of the son of man if you have if you haven't faed fly on every word of God to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these things to fly you must feed that is the reason the shout when he descending he the sh together the giggles together so that they can feed and be ready all right amen it says here let me read something here the same way he deal with Abraham he is dealing with Abraham City the last time Abraham saw it was a man it was God stand in a form of a man then after that Abraham's body changed Abram's body changed how let me just read something here The change was Jewel it was it was from it was within and upside are you together with because sah was buried he couldn't hold the seat in her womb her womb was not fit for receiving seed God had to change her from inside so that he can be a different from so that when can receive a SE after God has changed the hair from inside then he also change ha from outside that is that is how our change will be it will be from inside and outside what must change you from inside let me pass this one let me run to this one first this one I want to read it here it says the word you are receiving it is it must do something in you he said we cannot receive the promised son that is promised us today in this that you are living in [Music] bodies are the same it is this outside see tast feel smell here it's just is subject to die and will die but the inside part of you down in there inside that is the person that cannot die that that person that is where the New Life Starts [Music] from the new builds another person in the image of the person you are you must be changed from within you must be born again from within if you are changed from within then you will be changed outside I must be a new inside so that they can be changed outside and be a young man okay if I'm a young man outside but inside I'm still sinful that want help me I must be changed in when I am changed the inside then I can change the outside here that's why he says he says the word let me read it here again he says so potentially it is in here what it is we promised before the foundation of the world around there the only this only reflect the negative that will reflect the positive the weight and the same thing is the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the way that is in you the body will materialize around that and the same thing did by S [Music] she was changed from then then from within then it goes outside you are the word the word of God is the way that transforms you from within God send this way through the prophet so that it can you can receive it when you receive the weight inside that weight will transform you from the inside that is the cus that is the b word of the Son of God it is the way that is forming us that is the way that is the word upon the word it is giving us another Power so that we can fly are you together with me the change is going on right now is we are changing I believe the prophet says I I I I I believe let me read what the prophet says so that I can tell you what I believe amen the prophet says he says um I believe you are seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the I believe you are seeing it but I say I believe we we have seen the prophet says I believe you are seen now I say I believe we have seen the last thing to happen to this church before the rapture we have seen it they shouted The Voice the trumpets all these things are here with the bride the resurrection will take place then the when the resurrection takes place we we meet one another first the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep they will be Awakening they will be Awakening time those which are asleep in the dust now those that are asleep in sin not those are asleep in sin not those are sleep because they sleep right on don't awake for another thousand years but those who are asleep in dust in in the dust will be awakened F they will this corruption this corruptable body will put on incorruption and the Rapture the rapturing grace of in the rapturing grace of the lord we will all get together and when they begin to get then when we begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed they will rise first and we see them then when they have rised then we shall also we shall change these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there will be like a sweep over us you are changed you return back like Abraham was it be a s after a while you will be traveling like a thought you can see those them that are already dead resurrected what an hour then we will gather with them then we'll CAU up with them to meet the Lord in the air they are dead in the sea they shall rise from there those are dead those who were destroyed in the arena and eat up by those Lions those are thrown in the firey F and not even the bones will be left or dust they shall still rise whether they was in Rome or in the arena at Rome whether they were in the Tropic jungles of Africa in the Frozen regions of North they will rise from the dead and be changed and brought up Hallelujah and and the living shall be changed they will rise up when they rise up the the prophet says from China India everywhere they will rise up yes the church will be together but after Resurrection The Rapture will be set in they will rise up wherever they are we will we will get because you'll be tring like you'll be in China you will be in America be Africa at the same time we will be gathering together will be a gathering time because the voice is in [Applause] US am there is nothing left everything is is ready he says here one someone will be going to the pastor's house he will be gone he will be gone won't be seen anymore two will be in the field one will be taken one will remain after a while the church when it can when it can stay in that place every seat has been brought to each spot will be they they will be gone they won't know what happened to them one will be going one way one will be going over to the pastor's house and one will be going here there the first thing you know are not there for Enoch which was the type of of God which was the type which was the type God took him and he was found know come down to this this flying sources they they're coming down to investigate one will be going down there and he will be gone and he will never be seen anymore are you together with me let me read something here for the last here let me pass other books there and read this one let me say it is the last one it says here I wonder if this ministry climbs out the same way in the last days as it was as as the father sent me so I send you The Works that they do shall you do also but what I want to read for you here I wonder if this ministry climbs out the same way because Jesus last minister is when he's preaching to the he says I I don't know if this ministry is not driving the same way if this ministry is not preaching to the those who are lost this why people are against this are against this ministry because it is the third pool because the third pool is the ministry of Jesus Christ of this time when he is all right let me let me go on he says here they all right now is there any question first pool he healed the sick that's right the Cong says amen his second Ministry he was prophesying his thir Ministry was preaching to the Eternal laws Ministry all Ministries the same way not preached that is exactly right he went into the ark when he went into the ark there were seven days that nothing happened he was in the AR seven days nothing happened his testimony preached to the amen we shall come back God bless you amen let's lose our eyes as we pray our heavly father thank you we are living in a terrible time but a good time for the bride amen because they can see their time is over they can feel that they no more belong here they belong to another place they are living here with other people just like when Mary was living with them not knowing what was inside Mary that's like Sarah when he go to with Abraham to that country where the king wanted to marry Sarah not knowing what happened to her that this what people are not knowing what is happening this is another Ministry amen people go on preaching thinking they're getting people saved but it is over amen am help us Lord because this time this food is only for the bride is not for The Outsiders help us to understand to see and to accept what we are I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you [Music] so [Music] [Music]
