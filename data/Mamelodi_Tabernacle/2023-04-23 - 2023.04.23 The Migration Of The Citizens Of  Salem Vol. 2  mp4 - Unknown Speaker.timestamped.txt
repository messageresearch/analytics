[29:13] yeah yeah
[29:17] I think okay concerning the Easter
[29:20] Conference I hope to Tender my apologies
[29:23] as coordinator for misinformation in the
[29:25] final day which prevented the pastor
[29:27] with the mandate to preach for our
[29:29] inadequate in ADI Queens
[29:33] which ensued whichever angle they came
[29:36] kindly forgive us we love you and honor
[29:38] your blessing Ministry
[29:41] I've been taught by my pastor shija that
[29:44] the one you invite to preach has the
[29:46] jurisdiction to appoint whoever he feels
[29:48] can be of help to his ministry not under
[29:50] the influence of the postparts unless as
[29:53] so by the main speaker so what happened
[29:55] was contrary to what I am taught
[30:00] and
[30:03] including the deacons and a few pastors
[30:05] who participated in prayer a night
[30:07] before Sunday 9 April kindly tell pastor
[30:11] oh I think
[30:14] this one is our secret yeah
[30:19] amen yes God bless you God bless you

[30:31] before we look at the final end of the
[30:36] attributions
[30:40] we have our
[30:43] brothers and sisters
[30:46] I I think itching and every person
[30:51] uh
[30:52] baptized in this church
[30:56] the church should know about the the
[31:00] person
[31:04] somewhere even introduced this morning
[31:06] and
[31:10] some
[31:11] from Davidson
[31:14] were baptized last Sunday
[31:19] foreign
[31:25] it was because God used
[31:29] uh brother
[31:32] ushuma and their families
[31:39] and God was so good to
[31:42] to enter the family
[31:48] their beloved neighbors
[31:53] I think all that happened to them
[31:59] God know about it
[32:03] and then he will heal them completely
[32:08] I will even heal their house
[32:19] I think your brother introduced them I
[32:23] don't know I know

[58:22] bless your children and hear the sick
[58:26] and arrest the spirit
[58:29] God is trying to come
[58:32] trying to compare itself with the spirit
[58:35] of God Amen and even there's even Satan

[1:00:05] God
[1:00:08] all right
[1:00:10] sometimes you you will say you can think
[1:00:13] that we have read this last song
[1:00:17] only to find that
[1:00:19] it has not found the places
[1:00:25] I will still read to you
[1:00:27] when the prophet said
[1:00:32] something in me
[1:00:39] and
[1:00:41] it's so difficult
[1:00:46] for men to digest
[1:00:49] what is that something
[1:00:54] something in him
[1:01:00] amen amen
[1:01:02] sometimes we just end up saying hey
[1:01:08] meaning that it passes
[1:01:13] amen amen
[1:01:15] our amen should be amen because we see
[1:01:19] who have seen it

[1:02:32] when he died
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:37] the devil was rejoicing
[1:02:40] but remember Revelation chapter one
[1:02:45] when John met him
[1:02:48] he said
[1:02:50] foreign
[1:03:18] he came for that
[1:03:21] he knew that
[1:03:24] for him to uh
[1:03:27] get the keys

[1:03:36] amen amen
[1:03:38] then but there's a party
[1:03:40] even if I don't have the book yes
[1:03:44] where it says
[1:03:52] when he died
[1:03:54] there was celebration
[1:04:00] it is Jesus who
[1:04:03] when he was Tried by pilots
[1:04:09] Pilate

[1:07:32] falsely accused
[1:07:33] [Laughter]
[1:07:36] then
[1:07:38] being falsely accused
[1:07:40] the Bible says he never mumbles
[1:07:46] knowing that it was written
[1:07:51] that it will go that way foreign
[1:08:17] Nancy
[1:08:23] I read this party
[1:08:26] then when he died
[1:08:29] the book of Peter says
[1:08:32] you know his soul went down
[1:08:36] because this is
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:45] he is the Redeemer yeah

[1:08:51] he is
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:08] [Music]

[1:10:41] went down into the very lowest deaths of
[1:10:45] the lowest hair
[1:10:50] you know the Bible says he went down
[1:10:53] down
[1:10:55] and after the resurrection
[1:11:01] if he goes down he really goes down
[1:11:06] sometimes we have pride in order

[1:11:15] um sometimes
[1:11:17] if we are not of his nature
[1:11:24] amen amen but not Jesus
