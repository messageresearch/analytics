[33:43] [Music]
[33:51] uh-huh
[33:58] from the King's Men familiar

[34:52] Revelation chapter 4 from verse 1
[34:57] after this I looked and behold a door
[35:00] was open in heaven and the first voice
[35:03] which I had was s idler of a trumpet
[35:06] talking with me which said
[35:09] and I will show these things which must
[35:12] be here after
[35:14] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[35:16] behold a throne was open in heaven and
[35:19] one sat on the throne
[35:22] okay
[35:24] come up here
[35:26] and I will show you now minutes
[35:30] all right son
[35:32] because you can see it from where you
[35:35] are
[35:39] Ibrahim
[35:59] look from the place
[36:02] amen amen so he was supposed to look
[36:07] from a certain place
[36:10] and you know the Bible says
[36:13] the two uh who were with Christ
[36:20] the two who came
[36:23] and the one that remained with Abraham
[36:29] the two went on downtown
[36:33] now the Bible says
[36:37] Abraham stood with the Lord
[36:46] for the Lord spoke to him about what is
[36:50] going he was going on
[36:53] for God said about Abraham
[36:56] shall I hide from Abraham the things
[37:06] so God will tell Abraham everything
[37:10] now the Bible says
[37:13] the next morning
[37:16] Abraham went and stood to where he stood
[37:20] with them
[37:40] amen now John in the spirit that does
[37:44] Scripture
[37:46] standing up here in heaven
[37:49] is just being lifted up now from the
[37:54] church ages
[38:07] and I will show you things
[38:12] amen amen that's where our ministry is
[38:17] not not in the church
[38:21] we are not a church age
[38:29] join in the spirit standing up here in
[38:32] heaven
[38:35] he has just been lifted up now from the
[38:39] church age
[38:42] saw the church ages
[38:44] and then he was taken out
[38:47] in the fourth chapter he said come up
[38:51] here
[38:53] either
[38:55] I'm going to show you things that will
[38:58] come yes
[39:02] you can't see them from there
[39:06] you must come out
[39:10] then I will show you
[39:13] did you know that the bride is now out
[39:16] of the church
[39:22] and he saw one sitting on a throne
[39:31] has changed
[39:39] and he saw one sitting upon the throne
[40:40] you know that's why we are are called
[40:43] the right hand side people no matter
[40:45] tonight
[40:46] the book of redemptions
[40:51] and it was coming down from their right
[40:54] hand
[40:55] corner
[40:57] who stood on the right hands
[41:01] so we see that in the book of seals
[41:07] he was even put
[41:10] within the pyramid pyramid of the Angels
[41:14] amen
[41:19] amen
[41:21] [Applause]
[41:23] he speaks of an angel with the seventh
[41:27] seal
[41:28] um
[41:32] he saw this angel with the seventh seals
[41:39] and at the end of each all now like
[41:47] and he called that's and that angel the
[41:51] seventh seal now
[41:57] then you'll understand why the people
[41:59] say the seven seed is not a review
[42:08] today because if it is not revealed
[42:11] we don't have the title
[42:16] amen
[42:21] amen amen because she is of the his
