Description:
Title: The benefits of a relevant Ministry 
Preached By Elder Peter Skosana  at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 02 June 2024.

The Elder read the following scriptures:

John 1:18; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:6; John 17:1-3; John 8:37; John 10:30-35; Romans 8:16; 1Corinthians 15:45

The purpose of the sermon was to show the people about the benefits of a relevant Ministry.

In the Bible there is always a dispensation, and if you do not follow those dispensations you miss the relevant Ministry. 

In the time that we are living in, there is a relevant Ministry and that is the relevant one and if you can ignore that, you will enjoy the Bible but missing the strength of the relevance because God has different dispensation. 

God gave Moses a ministry to Moses to go and take out the Children of Israel , that was the relevant Ministry at that time. 

The relevant ministry will benefit us. 
During the time of Paul that was the only ministry that everybody has to align with. Any other ministry would not benefit anyone.

Each and every Church Age was connected to the eternal promise.  Each Church Age has its own ministry and promise. If you miss the promise you miss your inheritance. 
If you miss your ministry of your time then you go to the judgement then you will be saved by the judgement, because you missed the ministry of your time.

You cannot worship God not knowing what’s your promise and your inheritance, otherwise you will be a church goer. 

Our promise today is that He will grant us to seat with Him in his throne,that is our relevant Ministry, it is the Seventh Seal and that is why we are given the power of the Third Pull.  
You cannot be an overcomer if you haven’t fought the battle that is placed in front of you. 

The ministry should be relevant and when it is a relevant ministry there is power in it. When you pray having the relevant ministry God is duty bound to hear you. The relevant ministry makes you the Son of God, it makes you the revealed Word , when you ...

[Music] I greet you Saints in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ yeah I think many of you are surprise [Music] today okay so we were expecting Pastor so when we possibly we missed some wordss I was supposed to be in Le so he said no we agreed that I should be here but it's just a misunder understanding amen amen so that's what brought me here amen amen amen oh it's quite some time Zaki and the other thing is that now I was communing with the pastor uh so is's just relaxing at home according to the doctor's regulations but is very [Music] fine so we we communicate every day actually yeah some of you maybe think that know we have buried [Music] [Laughter] him if it was that then wouldn't be here yeah the pastor is fine just taking taking doctor's regulations he'll be coming to continue with the white stone amen amen amen as for today I'm just standing in the Gap we will do exactly what the pastor do uh we'll start by greeting those that are live streaming before you sit down I I will let we are done sorry we are done oh or they've done that amen okay fine then amen okay in that case then let's just go straight to the [Music] way let's read from uh the book of uh John 1 verse 18 1 verse 18 uh so brother [Music] harest it become easier when you John 1 verse 18 no man have seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him okay let's bow our heads gracious Lord this morning again Lord we are gathered here as your servants Lord and here is your sheep Lord Almighty with their hearts Open Lord to hear from thee father we always always say that our prayer is sufficient and our presence here is also sufficient Lord we left our homes Lord Almighty to come and commune with the and assemble all of us Lord Almighty with one spirit so to hear from thee and we believe Lord Almighty there never was a day where we come before thee and not here Lord Almighty from eternity amen so we pray Lord Almighty that as we have read just one uh verse in this Bible that you will uh increase it Lord Almighty so that gracious Heavenly Father we find satisfaction in your way amen thank you Father bless each and everyone that is here and father may you perform Lord Almighty yourself so that Lord Almighty when we depart from this place amen we W be hearing a man will be hearing you Lord through your anointing I ano I anoint each and every one of us here Lord gracious Lord thank you Father thank you my God that we pray calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen okay you may be seated [Music] yeah we've just read one uh verse uh that says uh no man has ever seen God you've seen it uh then it says no man has ever seen God at any time it's only the son it's only the begotten son which is in the bosom of the Father the Son is declared him okay amen right my TI will be the benefit of the relevant [Music] Ministry you know what a Ministry is you know what is the relevant Ministry is so now here in the Bible there's always dispensations and then those dis dispensation if you don't follow them you miss the relevant [Applause] ministry right in the time that you are living in there is a Ministry and that Ministry is the relevant one now if you can ignore that you'll enjoy the Bible but missing the strength of the relevance because God has different dispensations I always give an example about Moses that now when God said to Moses uh go to far to far and take my children out now there was a Ministry that he gave Moses and each and everyon of Moses has to do with taking them out now that was a relevant Ministry at that time there was no other Salon that Moses could preach that could shake the children of Israel and Shake far apart from that one the other one you can preach but it will never reach the mark and it won't let Fara release children of Israel so so now the relevant ministry will benefit us that's that's that's what I want us to to to share about okay I can give you an example about the different uh uh uh Church ages now during the time of of Paul that was the only Ministry every body should align with any other Ministry wouldn't benefit anybody and that's why each and every Church age was connected to the Eternal promise because on the first church age God said I I will give to each of the tree of life you see now where is the tree of life it's in eternity so the promise was the Eternal one now here God was speaking to the Overcomers see those Overcomers I will let them eat out of the tree of life there's no Ministry that can make you to eat out of the two of life during that era apart from Ministry of Paul now coming to irus the Overcomers he said they shall not be hurt by the second death see now if they won't be Hur by the second death you know what is the second test second is the Judgment which means they won't be going to any judgment and those that W go to the judgment will be the Overcomers during their era during their dispensation so you miss your ministry in your dispensation then you go to the judgment then you go to the you'll be saved by the Judgment because you missed the ministry of your age the ministry of your dispensation amen that isus now to Mar the Overcomers there he said he give them a white stone that's the one the Pastor said you will continue see now each and every Church age then after Mar comes col he says they will inherit all things I will be his God I will be their God and they shall be my son you see every Ministry has got a promise so even the one that we are going to [Music] now the one that I'll be telling you about has got a promise and if you miss your promise you miss your inheritance because the in each and every promise there is your inheritance look the thing that makes you to come here is because you want to inherit something now you will never inherit it if you don't know your promise you inherit according to your promise you cannot worship God not knowing what is your [Music] inheritance and what is your promise in that case you'll be just a church goer are together and then he he went on and says to the Overcomers on the fifth Church age says I'll give power over the Nations you see now those that will have power over all nations be in the New Jerusalem and All Nations will be out of the city they will come in but those that have power the one that are in the not that the other ones don't have power but the city is the main important one you know the prophet says he says uh he will be in a a certain street name in the New Jerusalem huj he himself he said I will be in the avenue called hallelujah hallelujah next to the worshiping team woring look to those angels so when you are worshiping you must know your your position in ET because the prophet claim to be that she will be next to you and hearing are we to to so on and on let's go to the sixth Church age I'll will make a pillar in the temple of God p in the in the temple of God each and every one of us who are Overcomers we know our dispensation now coming to us now what is our promise he says I will grant you is referring to us to sit with me in my Throne you see now is Grant to sit with us in his [Applause] throne that's what will benefit that is our Rel Ministry so now our relevant Ministry is the seventh SE that's why we given a power of the third pool are we together no now the Bible says uh you no no it's not the Bible it's a saying says you won't go to heaven on a rocking chair that is why they say uh yeah you won't go to heaven on a rocking chair that's why they say you are an overcomer you you cannot be an overcomer if you haven't [Music] fought there's a battle that is said before you you have to fight and win that battle each and every one of us because after the opening uh if you read uh Revelation 5 verse 9 my brother so that is the importance of the seventh seal what is so important about the seventh City now in verse 9 verse in Revelation chapter 5 and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation you remember that John wept when there was no one found that could take the book and open it and then the Bible said it was said to John weep not the lion of the tribe of Judah right now after the lion of the tribe of Judah then they started singing a new song after it was PR but I want you to notice one thing it is said the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed but if you read Revelation 5 Verse 6 verse can you read it my brother and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now the lion of the tribe of Jud has prevailed and here we see the lamb and when the seals were open we see brother Brenham coming from the westward to open now which is which the Bible says the lion of the tribe of Judah that is the prophecy but though when the manifestation comes we see the lamb taking the book but when we go to Revelation chapter 10 we see the angel with an open book and then the promise is but in the days of the voice because when John was about to write said John stop that will be revealed in the days of the voice of the seven angel but the prophecy said the lamb I mean it says the lion has prevailed we saw the lamb and then we see now Revelation 107 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin all Mysteries should be that's why now brother B comes in okay we will talk about those things right so let's continue so now we are here saying the ministry should be relevant and if the ministry is relevant there is power because if you you you you you you are you you are aligned with what God wants during that time we are pleasing God and God is Duty bound to hear [Music] you and God is Duty bound to answer you because you are doing what he wants you to do at that specific time it's relevant there's no way that you can miss a point when you have the relevant Ministry When you pray having the relevant Ministry isy bound to hear you because the relevant Ministry makes you the Son of God the relevant Ministry makes you the revealed [Applause] way now if you are the revealed way it will be God speaking to God there's no way that you can you can miss it are we together God speaking to God the Son of God speaking to God that is why one day in John chapter uh 17 oh Lord Jesus Christ let's open it you claim it because when you are right when you are right with God you have to claim what is yours can you read the first verse my brother these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also May glorify you see now he's claing he says the words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and say father the hour has come right amen glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify you see the right min he was definitely sure that he has glorified the father there's no point that the father could not glorify him amen look what he says verse two listen as thou given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him so now he has to give eternal life once he says and thou has given him power that they might Know Thee sorry sorry verse two thou has given him Power Over All Flesh it's like when he says uh when he speaks about the the joshuas will come to that it's God that says Pentecostal has failed and God with the Holy Ghost will raise Joshua that will give us our inheritance it's the word that comes from the prophet and the word that comes from the prophet of God when the prophet speaks it's God speaking now if the promise is that God will raise Joshua that will give us our inheritance then if there's any Joshua a soal Joshua that cannot give us inheritance then he's in an irrelevant Ministry because if the ministry is relevant I must have my inheritance you must have inhance because it's the promise are we together that is why now here he says thou has given him power he's claiming father you have given me power and with that power over All Flesh that I should give hear what he says he says you've given me power to give them eternal life right now that he has given them power to give them eternal life as many as thou has given him am amen amen verse three he says and this is life eternal that they might Know Thee you see if you do the right thing there's nobody that will miss it as long as you have given me the power and I gave them the word there's not even a single one that will miss as long there's a promise of the seventh seed and there's a Joshua who will give you inheritance there's no way that you'll miss it it's the promise it's the word of God look when the angel came to Mary what is important was not the angel what is important was the word that the angel carried you see amen the angel said You shall conceive you see and Mary believe that the angel carried the word from eternity there's no way that that word can miss a point are we together it's like uh this quotation that is on the seventh seal when the prophet spoke about the angel that flew right to him it's on this book The Seven SE in paragraph 4077 then listen to what the prophet now the angel was to my left will be will will really be the last or the seventh angel if we count them from left to right now you hear what he says he says now will be will really be the last or the seventh angel right amen now the seventh angel communicate with the seventh minister the Bible speaks about the seventh angel but in the days of the voice are we together now let me put it this way each and every one of us when we were born we were born in sin amen and then when we were born in sin we had our uh like uh we have our national life we didn't have divine nature we had nature we had our nature of our nation but after hearing the word of God and then the W was now implanted in us and the W germinated in us until we reach the St of a perfect man and when we reach the St of a perfect man and then God said this is my beloved Son and then he anointed us then that is when you receive your Eternal uh body which we call your theop now that theop is your angel there is your physical you and the supernatural you now the supernatural you goes according to the revelation of the way okay we'll come to that now it says now the angel okay fine he he was on my left then me looking to him towards the West him coming towards the east will be on the left so that would be the last Angel message and then he says very notable you know if they say something is notable is very important and very interesting if it's notable usually notable people are very powerful people it's not people remember how I said he had his he got his uh he had he got his back I mean his head back it was flying angel and his great sh Wings how he flew right into me he flew right to me okay there is this saying I've got Jesus in my heart now if you say you've got Jesus in your heart do you mean there's another man that entered into your bodyes no yes through the W of God when the word is revealed unto you changes your your your your natural life into the Divine Life I always say we are human beings we are born and bred on this Earth but we supposed to go to heaven now uh in the olden days we we thought that God is very far that's why we say our heavenly father to but are you aware that he has potentially descended hallu he has potentially descended into your heart through the revealed way amen now when he flew to him he was descending into his heart I'll explain that because he speaks about how he flew right to me and it's it's like some people might think that maybe he he got through the mouth or maybe open his mouth and got into his mouth let me give you an example if you read another book uh this book uh I'll I'll quote it for you it says here notice after the battle was over is this book uh I think it's a exposition of the seven Church ages of the church ages some they haven't got the paragraphs oh no this is who is thisis who is this paragraph 105 paragraph 105 notice after the battle was over M served his Victorious child communion that that is Abraham after the battle then he gave him communion okay the pastor Tau us the difference between the communion and lot there's a bread and wine and washing of feet and there's communion now communion is when God commune with now Abraham was standing here MC was standing there but in Abraham in the heart of abrah you know the Bible says Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent he saw three men coming to brother Bram says uh Abraham Abraham saw him while he was still in the pillar of fire before he get into that body so when he sees that man he knows that now this is not a normal there's a supernatural in that body so when they start communicating so Prophet says notice after the battle was over MCC served his Victorious child not Bread and Wine only no but even communion he communicated with him now the prophet says think of that part of himself so when they were communicating uh the prophet says he was giving off himself it's it's like when the pastor stand year behind this cool and you are sitting down there there's an anointing in him that is it's not the pastor communic it's it's what is in him am and you are not receiving him as a human being you receive the word through your heart so whenever you come to the service you you you you you see be beyond the person that is on the PO pit because he's communicating with your soul are we together so now he says notice after the battle was over MC served his Victorious yeah then he goes on and think of that part of himself now we want we want to see here in type here in view the communion you see amen the type in view the communion is not touching any bread talking about commun you see the power of the relevant Ministry at the time what gave Abraham that power knew what to expect at that time and and what is his promise at that you'll never miss a point when you know the promise of your time then he continues after the battle he gave off himself that is why you take all the church ages and The [Music] Messengers most of their of their Ministry uh you see them at the diling point you see Paul when he bring his ministry now when he was about to go so his ministry will Dil with that one ofus brother Brenham brother the Bible says he will turn their heart of the children to their fathers in other words now that is restoration but after restoration God gave him now a new commission now there are people that stop there at the restoration restored Paul set up a foundation Paul was a prophet and brother Bram was a prophet so for our father's support then he took the ministry I mean he took us back and then thereafter when we are okay then there comes now a new Commission Now that new commission is what we call the seventh seat that new Commission what we call the third pool what is the seventh SE what is the third pool okay we'll go to the so you see it now at the end of his ministry when brother Brenham was about to die the ministry changes now it's another dispensation of the same person then with Moses and and and and and Joshua it was Moses that moved out and reach the Red Sea it was another dispensation it was a Ministry now after crossing over and then it's another dispensation and the ministry changes are we together when they reach Kadesh the River Jordan then the ministry of Moses was finished and then he took his way and he went up the mountain and Joshua took over now Joshua Joshua had to give them their inheritance it's it's now the relevant Ministry at that [Applause] time it has nothing to do with the desert or the Red Sea or egpt now there is the captain of The Host [Applause] now he says I am the captain of the host now the seven SE it's like that when now the new commission start the captain of the host Tak over but you don't see anybody you see Joshua fighting the battle that was fought it was fought by Joshua but the captain said I am the captain of right the battle that is fought here now you see the pastor fighting the B but there's a captain of the [Applause] H do you understand when the man stands here there's a captain behind you are are you together and you remember Caleb said there was a time when Moses sent Caleb and Joshua to spy the land and Moses promise cbon and now what was in hebon they canites the Canaanites were not uh human to to that extent they they they were tall Giants there had six fingers on each hand six toes yeah you know golad is that type and their cities were fortified you couldn't go there but look at Caleb he said to Joshua that's my place that's the one Moses promised me because it's Caleb and Joshua that said we will eat them are we together right there it is now what we need to know you must have faith and believe that there's a captain of [Applause] the we together you could never have a revelation without faith the Bible says without faith you can't please God because what God do he hides himself in a man and then you need to have that faith that God has hidden himself in that Elohim El hided himself in the body ofc was a man but Moses had that faith that is why we are called the children of of Abraham Abraham was a Hebrew we are Zulus and and how can we be the Seed of Abraham through faith we the very same Faith Abraham had the very same faith that so we are the Seed of Abraham right are we together so now that's that's how now he flew right to brother and through faith brother Brenham knew that now it's in me read youre after the battle he gave off himself after the battle you have to fight until he gave off himself you know Jacob F and hold tight the angel until the angel gave off himself the whole night are we together huah until the angel said [Applause] isra now we want to see here that's what he says in Ty in view of the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ you hear what he says the communion is part of Christ when Christ communicate with you he gave off himself there's a part of him that's why you are called Christian that's why you are called the Son and Daughter of God you are part of God because you have received of God the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God now when you receive that receive part of God Amen after the struggle is over and after you've done got yourself wiped out then it's when you partake of now here is the important part says become part of this being that being is capital B [Music] you become part of this being who is this [Applause] being you get it now that is the power of the manifestation of the ministry you know the changing of the world situation and even the structures uh affect the manifestation of the prophets when when the prophet the prophecy is manifested there should be some shaking the prophet says God will present Christ with a beloved bride let's read that one the first son the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God you he what he says was a spoken seed word he was given the bride to produce himself the first Adam was given a bride so that he should produce himself the ch right Amen to produce another Son of God but she fell the bride right she fell by high bation then she caused him to Die the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bright like Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the we and die she doubted she left the we she died right amen now we speaking about the Pentecostals now from a little group of the true seed of the way that should be [Applause] you because Jesus was given a spoken seed word of God and that was given to a bride just like like Adam but she fell and then he says from a little group of the true seed of w of the word of God now God will present Christ a beloved bride she is a virgin of his weight when he says she is the virgin of his weight it means that she takes the the weight under no circumstances there's no hybrid takes the word as it is she doesn't doubt the word look we speak about The Throne uh we said now the promise to us uh the bride he said I will grant to sit with me in my Throne where is his throne is in our heart said now he will sit with us in his throne and if now he sits with us in his throne you receive him by faith see what makes you the bride is the word that you believe if you read in John uh 8:37 remember the Pharisees and the sagues uh were doubting him and they said they are the Abra they they Abraham seed now Abraham had faith in the word of God believed in God now Jesus said I know that you are Abraham seed now he means physical because Abraham was their father he bir to Isaac Jacob and the tribe of Israel that's why he says I know that that you are Abraham seed but after I said Abraham seed there's a call on there you see those two dots it joins the other sentence but you seek to kill it's continuation because my word had no place see that's how it is now when when the word uh comes from the mouth of God it must find a place now when he says from a little group of the true seed of the weight God will present Christ with a beloved bride when when he says she is a virgin of his word it means now there is uh the word finds a place in their heart now the word find place in your heart when the word find place in your heart it germinates that's what we call bride the bride is the terminated weight that's why when she is a virgin because she knows no man she knows no men's [Music] Creed or dogmas that's what you are amen you don't know any Creeds and dogmas I the the you you know the word that is relevant to you to the time that you living to your dispensation and apart from that there's nothing else that amen and then he continues and says by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God you hear what he says by and through the members of the Bride who are the members of the Bride he says from the group of the true seed of God then he will fulfill all that was promised you need to be very very happy when God want to manifest himself he manifest himself through you am when God want to show off show of through [Applause] you there was a time when God showed off he said what do you say about my son job you see he knew that job will never fail never regardless of what circumstances and you that once the word has find creep in your heart you will never fail never eternity is your home you see amen there's nothing that will divert you from because you [Applause] predestinated so now by and through the members of the bright will be fulfilled all that was promis of God to be manifested in the vision are together amen the word promise came to the Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise was he amen he himself to be made manifest when Jesus was going around here he was manifesting the way he was the Word of Promise when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he was talking about him so he was moving around manifesting that when when when the prophet speaks about the bride about you when you move around you are manifesting that there's nobody else that can manifest that way it's only you that can man that is why the Bible says no man had seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him you know what is to declare is to announce and affirm right amen you announce publicly or officially you area you CLA him God was manifest he himself at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that brought the message but the Angel's message was the W of God are we together the angel brought the we but the message you know but the Angel's message was the word of God now that is why now by the the events we we we could identify our uh dispensation because each and every dispensation have got a scope now what is happening during that dispensation you identify your position you'll be able to spot your mark and be balanced between the past and the future amen while you are in present when you are here you are able to see the past and see the future when you are in your dispensation in your ministry your ministry will show you the path show you the present show you the the future so we are covered you know that when you live here what's following from here on what following from your on What's following you are balanced are we together unlike beaing around the bush going up the mountain and pray and fast and do all those things while you are in the same place you know what you want now the prophet says the evils of this age fit is fitting to the prophecy for this evil age this book God of this evil in paragraph 29 he says the God of this evil age the God of this evil age as we have read in the scriptures the God of this world this evil age all all of us knows that this age is evil [Music] each and everyone when I go maybe to the mall I would say to myself I just want to see if I could see a welled woman I will look around I couldn't find even a single one you won't find even a single one unless maybe I meet some of the sisters but ordinarily you you see this age is evil is Wroten to the [Applause] call you see now he says now this now this message points out the evils of this age and it is is fitting to prophesy for this evil [Music] age you see this message is a prophecy this evil AG prophesying now notice CL I'm reading paragraph 31 31 now notice closely now as we study the word the God of this evil age that we are now living may seem strange a very strange thing in this age of Grace when God is taking people for his name sake that is his bride in this evil age that should be called the age of evil when we say this is evil age God rais up his bride to prophesy against the very age that is that God is calling a people for his name sake by grace and is called an evil age now we prove by the Bible that this is the age that he was speaking off very strange thing to think that age like this that God will be calling his you see now the challenge is the world has got its own thing the bride is condemning the world now you cannot be enticed by the worldly life that's is why your work is to prophesy against just your your your appearance it's a prophecy your appearance is a condemnation [Applause] to now he continues and say now listen for Satan is not I mean now listen for Satan is not spoke of as a god of another age but this age now when Satan is the God of this age then we should have a bride which represent our God and the bride will combat that s because he says he's the God of this age now the prophet says Satan was not the god of the age of Noah Satan was not a god of the time of Moses Satan was not a God in the time of elij this evil age he is he says don't meet you he is the God of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions and of people and they don't know it it is you look at now even young girls young boys they are dressed in ritual attire you go to any River you see them doing rituals go to any D you'll see them doing rituals go to any sea and any stream you go to any school they're doing rituals that's why he says he is the God of this evil age worship by millions and billions of people and they don't know [Music] it even at school if a child got an attack you pray for that child they put you behind bars they not supposed to he's speaking to his ancestors don't dist that's why they say you don't have to pray for because when you do that you are casting away the demon and they said that demon is the ancestors he's got the right he's got the right to communicate with they are his ancestors you see now he has Creed in even in all nations right when you see the actions of the people maybe going to church and hear the bells ringing now he says now they will they will give you the the the the you you can have an answer on what they doing that now they are going to church and knowingly where the truth is our Lord's Ministry was questioned about the past that was set by Moses and the power of the relevancy in his ministry what is what I'm saying here that when our Lord Jesus Christ was here on Earth the Pharisees the SES the scribes we're questioning our Lord Jesus Christ about the ministry of Moses and the power now the power of the relevancy was uh defeating the the the the people they had the ministry of Moses now when he comes it's another dispensation that explain exactly what Moses was doing are we together that yes Moses did a good thing the time that we are living in that Ministry is irrelevant the relevant Ministry is this of our Lord Jesus Christ Isaiah Moses and everybody was speaking about him and then when he comes now it's another Ministry that is relevant that is why say our Lord's our Lord's Ministry was questioned about the past that was uh said by Moses and the power of the relevancy in his in the Christ Ministry corrected the past and even set a mark for the future it correct the past and set the mar yes Moses said so but it was not so so correcting the p setting a mark together right he says you were there in his attributes you don't remember it who can remember he says you were there and you don't remember you cannot remember it with your mind when you were there you were a theop you were Supernatural That's why it says you were there in his attribute you don't remember it because you just part of his life you are part of God when you become a son or a daughter of right amen then the attribute was first God that the pastor always teaches us about the then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed see without being expressed then when he expressed secondary he became the way and then the word was made flesh and dwell Among Us are we together then when he dwell among us then it shows that you were the attribute of his bride is himself [Music] revealed the word is the bride when he says the word is now in the bride is himself revealed now he's giving an example about the wise and foolish virgin says the bride went in there's a whole difference between the church and the bride I'm I'm reading from this spoken with the breach paragraph 265 it says the bride went in there's a whole difference between the church and the bride yes sir am went into the wedding Ser the seals were broke broke while in the last Church age to reveal those truth the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his CH in order to collect his subject for his kingdom the Bri he broke the SS in order to collect his subject his own subject for his kingdom his subject is his bride his bride is the revealed way how would you get now when he speaks about the difference between the church he's speaking about the word and the revealed word the bride is the word that is revealed the mystery of God is when God and Men combine and be one thing that is the mystery when God and man combine and one that is the mystery he says before they could be a creation in your heart there has to be a creator that create that creation are we together so you see how important the relevancy of the ministry the ministry of your time and the ministry of your time makes you a god with with with a small G that's scripture on John chapter 10 brother har John 10 uh John 10 you start from verse 30 I and my father Are One MH then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him Jesus answered them many good works have I show you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone the not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself God Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods yeah just stop there it says it's written in your law that ye are Gods can you see that g it's not a cap you are God continue if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came stop if you call them God small je unto whom the word of God capital G came and the scripture cannot be broken you see now you are a god with a small G so now when the word is in you it makes you God that worship God a god with a small G it's like it's like when the word comes unto you you find you you've got a spirit the scripture we have in uh Romans 8:1 16 ver 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit yeah now it's speaking about two Spirits it says the spirit Capital as you see that is called Spirit be witness with our spirit small as you see that we are the children of God it's when now the prophet says that is the anointing Christ is the anointing the spirit comes upon the word that quickens the word when you read the word then there should be a spirit that comes and quickens you see so that you should understand to make it live when you read it you are reading it but apart from go if God does not Quicken it that word is not alive you are just reading so there is no Revelation but God must Quicken it it quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart then you believe it's like if you read First Corinthians chapter uh uh 15 Corinthians verse 45 I think I'm closing now now the ministry of your time is is an anointing like brother Bram when he was speaking to Sister he got an anointing and when he went when he he received the the the the the the third pool Ministry he went to hunt squirrel and then God said to him do you want squirrels says how many he says three then he says under that anointing it was in me saying that it was God saying there even when he was speaking to Sister he says it was God speaking same God that was in him in sister when sister said The Souls of my two boys then it was God saying because nobody who is very very poor who is hungry who has got no clothes can call a soul he's going to speak about food in the house and things like that he going to speak about the problems that he's facing we together yeah now it says God now anoints the we that one let's close amen First Corinthians chapter 15 vers 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last was made a quickening spirit Now who is the last Adam Jesus he was a quickening spirit the first Adam was made a living Soul that's what the Bible says man was made a soul that is alive somebody that has God soul in himself but with Jesus Christ he was a quickening spirit any word that comes out of your mouth was quicking was changing you the last scripture John 6 joh 6 62 62 and 63 63 I'm closing my Bible what and if he shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before just stop there amen you see now it was our Lord Jesus Christ saying what and if you see the son of man Ascend to where he was you know that the seventh seal takes you to where you was [Applause] before it takes you to your original position then continue it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh profiteth nothing yeah the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you see the words spoken to us they are spirit and they are alive may the Lord bless you God bless you I will ask prak to pray for us at what point at what time are we to be here you gave us a prophet you gave us a pastor amen you gave us Elders yes we are in your heart oh God hallu and this is your ministry amen we are getting closer this is just the manifestation of
