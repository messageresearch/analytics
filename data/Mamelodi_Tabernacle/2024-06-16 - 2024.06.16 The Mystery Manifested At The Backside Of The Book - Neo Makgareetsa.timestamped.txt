[1:22:45] 12:4 but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[1:22:48] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:22:52] of the end many shall run to and fr and
[1:22:56] knowledge shall be increased
[1:22:59] am amen amen you may be
[1:23:02] seated may God richly bless
[1:23:05] you I've got two spoken word here in
[1:23:08] hard
[1:23:10] copies when you see me start reading
[1:23:14] them then you know I'm about to
[1:23:17] close because they have answers for the
[1:23:21] day the unveiling of God
[1:23:25] and the Mighty God unveil before
[1:23:31] us amen amen but for now we read the
[1:23:36] scripture and we many things many many
[1:23:42] think many people
[1:23:44] think that the Bible is got answers for
[1:23:50] everything but you will realize
[1:23:53] that does not not have answers for
[1:23:57] everything but we became the answer for
[1:24:03] everything where we read we see
[1:24:08] Daniel uh you know getting the message
[1:24:10] from
[1:24:11] God or from the angel from
[1:24:14] God revealing
[1:24:18] him revealing him a lot of
[1:24:21] things then he was about to write
[1:24:26] and then the angel said to
[1:24:27] him shut up the
[1:24:30] we and seal the book even to the time of
[1:24:34] the
[1:24:35] end many shall
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:39] run
[1:24:40] to and
[1:24:42] knowledge shall be
[1:24:46] increased amen amen is this the
[1:24:49] answer it's not the answer but is a
[1:24:53] mystery that was shut
[1:24:56] up so we don't have an answer for
[1:24:59] this and Daniel was in the Old
[1:25:02] Testament many years passed by that
[1:25:05] secret was still
[1:25:09] SE amen and you know before this
[1:25:12] scripture when you read Daniel chapter
[1:25:15] 10 this message come from the presence
[1:25:18] of
[1:25:20] God and Lucifer fought for 2 one
[1:25:26] days for Daniel not to get the
[1:25:30] message but after Daniel got the
[1:25:33] message God said to him shut that
[1:25:38] message at the right time it shall be
[1:25:44] revealed amen amen so my message this
[1:25:48] morning is about the mystery
[1:25:52] manifested the mystery man
[1:25:57] at the back side of the
[1:26:01] Bible because you will read the Bible
[1:26:05] from the book of Genesis until the Book
[1:26:07] of Revelation but brother says is still
[1:26:11] a
[1:26:12] Myster as a Clos book but the answer for
[1:26:16] this is right at the back of
[1:26:20] the who are at the back side of the
[1:26:22] Bible
[1:26:25] it's
[1:26:26] you you you you have the answer for the
[1:26:29] Bible you have the answer for the
[1:26:33] world so you are the
[1:26:35] answer so you know
[1:26:38] brother in the message called seeing or
[1:26:41] looking at the
[1:26:44] Unseen he said that message is for the
[1:26:48] individual there are many people that
[1:26:52] see what others cannot
[1:26:56] see that he what others cannot
[1:27:02] hear and is the individual
[1:27:07] message like when you read in the book
[1:27:09] of Exodus
[1:27:13] 3 from verse 1 to 5 verse 1 to 5 the
[1:27:17] Bible says Moses was a
[1:27:20] shepherd and God pulled him out
[1:27:24] and take him to the backside of the
[1:27:29] Des he remove it from the
[1:27:33] people and make him to be
[1:27:36] alone so that he can talk to
[1:27:39] him when God want to talk to
[1:27:42] you remove you from the
[1:27:45] people so that you can meet him
[1:27:57] face as long as you have this here
[1:28:01] says you are not sure you haven't meet
[1:28:04] him you are not even allowed to
[1:28:07] talk you are allowed to talk when we
[1:28:11] have that
[1:28:12] experience of the back side of the
[1:28:17] Des where you meet
[1:28:19] him face to face so Daniel saw something
[1:28:24] he had something he wanted to give it to
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:29] people but the heaven says
[1:28:31] no you
[1:28:33] know you just seal the thing
[1:28:36] and it's not a public
[1:28:40] thing
[1:28:42] individual it's not even supposed to be
[1:28:44] head in
[1:28:46] Israel because with
[1:28:49] Israel as a nation but God deals with a
[1:28:52] gentile as an
[1:28:56] individual that means this message of
[1:28:59] Daniel was for the
[1:29:02] Gentile was for the
[1:29:05] individual we are individual this
[1:29:08] morning and this
[1:29:10] morning and this morning there are
[1:29:13] others that are looking at the and
[1:29:18] see others cannot
[1:29:21] see it's natural
[1:29:26] a it's
[1:29:28] undeniable you cannot argue it it's like
[1:29:33] that it was always like
[1:29:36] [Music]
[1:29:38] that amen when Steven saw heaven
[1:29:43] open it was him seeing it the others
[1:29:46] were there but you didn't see
[1:29:50] it and when you see
[1:29:53] such fanatic to
[1:29:57] others exactly this
[1:29:59] morning when you see something and the
[1:30:03] person next to you do not see that you
[1:30:07] become
[1:30:11] fanatic amen amen we see Paul
[1:30:15] experiencing the same
[1:30:17] thing when he said to the people it's 14
[1:30:21] years
[1:30:22] now I kept this
[1:30:25] secret he saw something when the heaven
[1:30:28] open but he couldn't preach it he he
[1:30:33] could even not say to the next
[1:30:36] person because some of the things when
[1:30:39] you see them and look at the people the
[1:30:43] way they disbelieve the word of God you
[1:30:46] can't even tell
[1:30:49] them you just keep it for
[1:30:51] yourself but the years pass by
[1:30:54] the years PP the 10th year
[1:30:58] PP keeping that
[1:31:00] secret but one of the
[1:31:02] days 14th year he
[1:31:09] just happens these people I tell
[1:31:13] them it happens
[1:31:16] today if I see something you don't see I
[1:31:19] will just say if you see you will see
[1:31:23] you don't see it's not for me to let you
[1:31:27] see but when you go at the back side of
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:31] desert where you meet him face to
[1:31:34] face you might see what I
[1:31:36] see
[1:31:40] because with
[1:31:42] you amen amen am then Paul say I saw a
[1:31:48] man in
[1:31:50] Christ amen amen only few
[1:31:55] but who that man he
[1:31:58] so I'm saying today we we mustn't have
[1:32:03] all those
[1:32:05] Mysteries as
[1:32:08] Mysteries but we must have those
[1:32:11] Mysteries having the
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:18] answers if he stay with us he will not
[1:32:22] hide anything for us he will reveal
[1:32:25] everything to us we will have answers
[1:32:28] for every
[1:32:29] question if you still have
[1:32:32] questions meet him at the back side
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:35] of it's an
[1:32:38] individual it's not a group
[1:32:41] thing because in the
[1:32:43] group amen one was saying um sorry a
[1:32:48] little
[1:32:49] bit like in
[1:32:52] politics our you know ruling
[1:32:55] government they were together in the
[1:32:58] Exile they were you know in good heart
[1:33:02] they were fighting the enemy and one of
[1:33:05] the days they conquer the enemy and then
[1:33:08] they take the government now the very
[1:33:10] same people that fought the enemy won
[1:33:13] the enemy they are fighting among
[1:33:18] themselves it's a group thing here in
[1:33:21] the message is not political
[1:33:24] it's not a group thing
[1:33:27] individual W
[1:33:30] like amen amen so Paul alone saw that
[1:33:36] wanted to share with the
[1:33:38] people others could catch others
[1:33:41] couldn't catch and Paul had the highest
[1:33:45] office in that time the office of an
[1:33:49] apostle and Paul was the messenger of
[1:33:54] the first church age
[1:33:56] Ephesus but he was scared to
[1:34:00] such knowing the heart of the
[1:34:06] people amen even our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:10] when he was preaching others could not
[1:34:13] catch but a few will go to he further
[1:34:20] explanation in the word of God we don't
[1:34:23] worship with
[1:34:28] groups not because we are friends not
[1:34:31] because we are colleagues not because we
[1:34:33] are family member not because we are in
[1:34:36] the same
[1:34:37] church
[1:34:42] individual brother if I don't see what
[1:34:44] you
[1:34:45] see you don't see what I see what can I
[1:34:51] do go back at the B side of the
[1:34:55] desert because these Min Mysteries are
[1:34:59] revealed at the backside of the
[1:35:05] Bible amen amen let's read the
[1:35:08] scripture Revelation
[1:35:11] chapter 10 verse 7 the common scripture
[1:35:17] because I want to show you something if
[1:35:20] we is the scripture giving us the answer
[1:35:26] re
[1:35:27] ver but in the days of the voice of the
[1:35:30] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:35:33] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:35:36] finished as he had declared to his
[1:35:39] servants the prophets amen do you have
[1:35:42] the
[1:35:44] answer isn't Revelation the book of the
[1:35:47] last book in the
[1:35:49] Bible but the more you read it is the
[1:35:53] more you
[1:35:55] confused I thought when we read
[1:36:00] already everything but it doesn't close
[1:36:03] everything because you will get many
[1:36:07] interpretation out of the same
[1:36:09] script amen amen in the days of the
[1:36:12] voice of the seventh
[1:36:14] angel when he shall begin to
[1:36:17] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:36:20] finished as he declared to his the
[1:36:25] John is trying to tell you I don't have
[1:36:28] to
[1:36:30] there I'm not obliged to tell
[1:36:33] you because God said to him as well John
[1:36:38] seal the
[1:36:40] thing Daniel seal
[1:36:44] the
[1:36:45] Steven you can tell them if they don't
[1:36:49] see what you see it's none of your
[1:36:52] business so the whole
[1:36:54] Bible becomes a
[1:36:59] mystery the only
[1:37:02] moment where we can find the answer is
[1:37:05] when we go at the back side of
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:10] the I'm telling you when you look at the
[1:37:14] Old
[1:37:15] Testament going towards the new it's
[1:37:18] like when you are in the New Testament
[1:37:20] you get the answer for what happened in
[1:37:22] the Old Testament
[1:37:24] and when you get to the New Testament
[1:37:27] you get more un
[1:37:29] confused but now it's like the answer
[1:37:33] for the New Testament must be
[1:37:38] somewhere
[1:37:39] amen we have the
[1:37:43] answer get out of History a little
[1:37:47] bit be
[1:37:49] realistic live in a real world

[1:37:55] living know your

[1:48:12] man he met the
[1:48:15] supernatural he scared of no
[1:48:17] one because he has seen him when you
[1:48:21] have seen God when you have had God face
[1:48:25] to face with him when you come back you
[1:48:28] are no longer the
[1:48:32] same you know Moses was an
[1:48:35] ordinary like anyone you can even rebuke
[1:48:39] him but when he met
[1:48:42] God you better listen to
[1:48:45] him you better listen to
[1:48:48] him because he's no longer the same
[1:48:51] because one of the
[1:48:53] they came to him you are not the only
[1:48:57] one who God is talking to he can talk to
[1:49:01] God as well and God said to Moses it's
[1:49:05] okay let them
[1:49:07] prepare I will come and talk to them
[1:49:11] when God descend they say we don't want
[1:49:13] to see you please send
[1:49:18] Moses and talk to them amen amen there
[1:49:22] are other people by Nature they just
[1:49:25] belittling other
[1:49:29] people
[1:49:31] respective you have what God has in
[1:49:37] you just be
[1:49:40] little we had a meeting at work the
[1:49:42] other
[1:49:43] day you know in in in the work we don't
[1:49:47] have you know we are not at the same
[1:49:50] position when we are not in the same
[1:49:52] position
[1:49:53] we got Senior
[1:49:55] Management managing director was there
[1:49:57] as well and general man was there as
[1:50:00] well and we have construction crew
[1:50:04] General work we've got
[1:50:07] Artisan got surveying and all those kind
[1:50:09] of things then there was this value that
[1:50:13] we
[1:50:14] call you know
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] respect then you started to learn that
[1:50:23] when the management
[1:50:26] talk about respect they about it for the
[1:50:32] sake of a company Val or company polic
[1:50:38] but who that one called General
[1:50:41] workers they are getting
[1:50:44] disrespected because of their position
[1:50:47] then I stood up and say I think when
[1:50:51] whoever
[1:50:53] made that value of
[1:50:57] respect God must have visited him
[1:51:00] because respect is not because of my
[1:51:04] position in the
[1:51:05] company but
[1:51:08] respect it's a soul to soul
[1:51:16] relation if you can respect that
[1:51:20] Soul you have respected God
[1:51:24] respective I'm anying
[1:51:26] peanuts you are having F Che F check
[1:51:31] doesn't
[1:51:33] matter respect me yes I will respect
[1:51:36] [Applause]
[1:51:41] you that's what is happen in
[1:51:43] life the spoken
[1:51:46] we it is I so when
[1:51:51] Moses when back to
[1:51:53] Egypt he was no longer the
[1:51:56] same because he
[1:51:59] met
[1:52:04] God I'm telling you today there are
[1:52:08] people who are meeting God face to
[1:52:15] face while you are still
[1:52:17] arguing is you arguing but there are
[1:52:20] people who meet God
[1:52:23] face to
[1:52:28] face if that is not the case why are we
[1:52:31] reading Bible what are we learning from
[1:52:33] the Bible who are
[1:52:39] we I don't know the height of
[1:52:44] Moses but the way you are strong maybe
[1:52:47] he was tall I'm not sure but the Bible
[1:52:51] says you know uh Jesus Christ when he
[1:52:55] was amongst them you could not even
[1:52:59] identify because he was just like that
[1:53:02] it's not about the structure
[1:53:06] of but is what he
[1:53:10] was you you will realize how powerful he
[1:53:18] was now God knows that
[1:53:23] in the end of the
[1:53:26] world go people's going to rise
[1:53:30] up great schols and
[1:53:33] intellect and explain all the Bible
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] away and no
[1:53:41] man has a right behind the
[1:53:45] pit and no man has a right behind the P
[1:53:51] pit and no man has a right to call
[1:53:55] himself a
[1:53:58] Christian until he once got back
[1:54:03] there until he once got
[1:54:08] back there on the back side
[1:54:12] of under
[1:54:20] those God fa
[1:54:24] he had
[1:54:26] experience amen you cannot call yourself
[1:54:29] a
[1:54:30] Christian if you haven't
[1:54:36] met you might be longing the message you
[1:54:40] can break about that that I was baptized

[1:54:44] so but if you met him face to
[1:54:49] face sing
[1:54:58] your do you

[1:57:19] the people the
[1:57:20] mathematics when he was teach them
[1:57:22] mathematics he could teach them some of
[1:57:25] the things because he was to
[1:57:28] them if I teach you all you will
[1:57:32] outshine me you must get this little so
[1:57:35] that I can be
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:41] remaining now that teacher is late now
[1:57:44] the people are with limited
[1:57:48] [Applause]
[1:57:52] not our God not our Prophet not our
[1:57:56] pastor when we get taught we really get
[1:58:00] taught something that will sustain us
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:09] until
[1:58:11] am amen amenu standing in the capap the
[1:58:15] message well it
[1:58:18] happened to be at least one man
[1:58:22] in present this morning who was standing
[1:58:26] there when it happened that is brother
[1:58:30] and some other things honestly they are
[1:58:33] not easy to
[1:58:37] utter I saw brother Bram as
[1:58:39] well going there going there try to
[1:58:43] check if ever what I'm trying to
[1:58:47] cheat will have place in the heart of
[1:58:50] the Saints
[1:58:55] it actually shook the rock off of the
[1:58:59] mountain and now we found out that
[1:59:03] during that time I saw seven angels in a
[1:59:07] form of a pyramid that St down and
[1:59:12] picked me up and I was brought
[1:59:14] East to open the seals for
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:20] God Amen
[1:59:24] it was not an easy
[1:59:26] thing for brother
[1:59:28] say yeah let me read for you where he
[1:59:32] said it God's power to
[1:59:35] transform he said now it's hard to say
[1:59:40] this it's very hard because speaking to
[1:59:44] people who feel the same way I
[1:59:50] do the way I been for many
[1:59:53] years but since the opening of those
[1:59:58] seals of the Angels just behind the
[2:00:01] mountain
[2:00:03] Yonder this has become a new
[2:00:09] book is the things that been
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:14] he is been
[2:00:16] revealed as God promised in the
[2:00:19] Revelation chapter 10
[2:00:22] that he will do it and we are
[2:00:28] privileged we are privileged
[2:00:31] people that God have
[2:00:35] chosen of this Earth that we might
[2:00:39] see and understand this
[2:00:42] things which is not some
[2:00:46] mythical fleshly
[2:00:50] Mind of a person trying to make it
[2:00:53] up is the word of God made
[2:00:58] manifest proven that's
[2:01:02] right PA hold this secret for 14
[2:01:06] years brother to say
[2:01:09] this it was not
[2:01:12] easy because it was talking about
[2:01:18] [Applause]
[2:01:20] him there was never a
[2:01:22] time where Jesus Christ says I am God
[2:01:27] the creator of
[2:01:29] Heaven said but when the people look at
[2:01:33] him they crucify
[2:01:36] him saying you being a
[2:01:39] man you make yourself
[2:01:42] God he never said I'm God but they
[2:01:45] crucify him for that
[2:01:47] reason because they read the Bible the
[2:01:50] scroll
[2:01:52] and they've seen how God does
[2:01:55] things when they see God doing things
[2:01:59] and they look at Jesus Christ they see
[2:02:02] the characteristics of God in
[2:02:05] him and they just need to be
[2:02:10] assassinated because he's a man the son
[2:02:14] of Mary and Joseph but he make himself
[2:02:22] some other things you cannot
[2:02:24] hide the more you hide the more you get
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:02:32] exposed even people with evil Hearts
[2:02:36] when they try
[2:02:37] to the more they get exposed that they
[2:02:40] have hearts that are
[2:02:42] [Applause]
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:45] evil You Can't Hide
[2:02:48] yourself amen amen question and
[2:02:52] answers and now the opening of the
[2:02:56] seals that was given by the Holy
[2:02:59] Spirit the Seven Seals was only to make
[2:03:04] known you see the reason why what had
[2:03:08] been
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:12] left of in the
[2:03:15] dispensation behind
[2:03:20] us the dispensation behind
[2:03:23] us are a
[2:03:26] dispensation in the
[2:03:28] Bible they are behind us the reason why
[2:03:32] the seven seal
[2:03:34] open is for us to make
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:44] know we cannot continue talking about
[2:03:48] Bible as the one
[2:03:54] just read no sometimes somewhere somehow
[2:04:00] you need to hit the
[2:04:03] [Applause]
[2:04:04] call if you haven't hit the
[2:04:08] call says you are not yet a
[2:04:15] worshiper the children of Israel in the
[2:04:18] journey those was that one came out of
[2:04:21] Egypt
[2:04:22] they didn't reach
[2:04:23] Canan because of their hard and
[2:04:27] heart those that one were born on the
[2:04:34] way and God did that
[2:04:37] deliver same thing
[2:04:42] today since the open of those
[2:04:45] seals it's a
[2:04:48] Harding amen amen didn't know how to put
[2:04:54] it but because he's a prophet he have to
[2:04:58] put it for the
[2:05:01] beneficiary the
[2:05:04] [Applause]
[2:05:07] Bri he
[2:05:09] said
[2:05:11] angels in the form of a
[2:05:14] pyramid sh me
[2:05:16] down pick me up those seven
[2:05:20] angels pick him
[2:05:22] up put him in the
[2:05:25] middle and take him to go and open
[2:05:32] the now tell me didn't the Bible
[2:05:36] said only the
[2:05:39] lamb should open the
[2:05:44] L now the Bible read
[2:05:47] us we will look at this and said to
[2:05:50] brother
[2:05:52] what are you trying to tell
[2:05:53] [Music]
[2:05:55] us the Bible says the lamb that was
[2:05:59] slain before the of the world and the
[2:06:02] Bloody lamb is the one that is worthy to
[2:06:06] open the seal but today you open the
[2:06:09] seeds for
[2:06:13] [Applause]
[2:06:15] God service after the service there will
[2:06:18] be a
[2:06:19] meeting I don't know the
[2:06:23] elders friendship and so for and say

[2:06:35] heard him yourself he says he opens
[2:06:39] the now is it him or is it the L then
[2:06:43] you agree AG that it is actually now
[2:06:48] what is this man talking about
[2:06:54] there you go because it's two
[2:06:58] contradiction you must
[2:07:00] choose the lamb you must choose brother
[2:07:05] or brother is the
[2:07:12] Lamb Brothers our own
[2:07:17] understanding will not make it in the
[2:07:19] word of

[2:19:23] now God is building his
[2:19:26] church amen
[2:19:29] amen
[2:19:31] always all the
[2:19:33] years the man of God says the men of God
[2:19:38] in the old and the New
[2:19:40] Testament they had one
[2:19:43] thing
[2:19:45] common to see
[2:19:49] God Amen
[2:19:51] because God was just talking to them
[2:19:55] they were just seeing Miracle but the
[2:19:57] same what is
[2:19:59] happening that is why others resulted in
[2:20:03] ancestral
[2:20:06] wor because they didn't have the answer
[2:20:09] but listen here page
[2:20:14] say had
[2:20:16] job but his desire job
[2:20:21] was to see
[2:20:23] God you know job was the son of God but
[2:20:26] he haven't seen God he wanted to see
[2:20:31] him and he was made known to
[2:20:35] God through will
[2:20:39] wind yet he did not exactly see
[2:20:43] him but God was
[2:20:47] veiled inwind
[2:20:50] [Applause]
[2:20:51] saying we found Down in
[2:20:55] Africa South Africa they use the
[2:21:00] word which
[2:21:02] means an unseen
[2:21:09] Force you just pray you just close your
[2:21:12] eyes and pray and God give you the
[2:21:15] answer father who is this
[2:21:18] God Amen and this unseen
[2:21:22] force in the will wind had an audiable
[2:21:29] voice that was job wanted to see God and
[2:21:33] Moses as well wanted to see God and God
[2:21:37] gave me an opportunity and he saw the
[2:21:39] back part of a
[2:21:43] man which means the
[2:21:46] Unseen was made visible
[2:21:51] God to whom I worship God to whom I
[2:21:54] worship is now in a man I saw the back
[2:21:58] part
[2:22:01] of and he was happy but
[2:22:08] like then life goes on as you today you
[2:22:12] are in the message but really you are
[2:22:14] still
[2:22:19] probing amen whether you are on the
[2:22:22] right track or what whether you have
[2:22:24] seen him or not who is this God yes is
[2:22:28] with us but the Bible says is now in us
[2:22:34] because God whom you
[2:22:37] worship
[2:22:39] himself in aen can I tell you that is
[2:22:43] the seven SE
[2:22:49] [Applause]
[2:22:54] page
[2:22:55] 15 you will hear what the prophet
[2:22:58] says amen he said there's a word in
[2:23:02] Greek that uses
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:05] kenos he emptied himself
[2:23:09] out and
[2:23:12] mor he changed from what he
[2:23:15] was to what he is he never Chang his
[2:23:18] nature
[2:23:21] but on the day of the
[2:23:23] Pentecost he changed
[2:23:25] from being the son of man to the Son of
[2:23:29] God he came not with the people he came
[2:23:35] in
[2:23:38] the the same God to carry his ministry
[2:23:43] on through in this great
[2:23:48] age amen amen so now he
[2:23:53] himself made
[2:23:55] himself known to us and indwell
[2:24:01] himself in
[2:24:04] us until when you walk it's not you
[2:24:08] walking it's not walking when you speak
[2:24:12] it's not you
[2:24:13] speaking speaking using your
[2:24:17] body today God is using
[2:24:23] [Applause]
[2:24:28] when the seven seal was open there was
[2:24:31] silence in heaven about space of an half
[2:24:35] an
[2:24:36] hour and then God leave the throne when
[2:24:41] he leave the throne he came down when he
[2:24:44] come down the angels in heaven those
[2:24:48] that were saying holy holy to the Lord
[2:24:52] they stop because you cannot holy holy
[2:24:56] the empty
[2:24:59] SE when God comes down the Angels were
[2:25:03] looking at him and they see God
[2:25:06] incarnate himself in a human flesh and
[2:25:11] the angels leave Heaven as well follow
[2:25:15] that one they are saying holy holy when
[2:25:18] he incarnate himself
[2:25:21] in a human fles they keep on saying holy
[2:25:24] holy they keep on saying You Are Holy
[2:25:30] One
[2:25:31] amen that's what brother B was trying to
[2:25:36] tell when God comes down he give him all
[2:25:40] the
[2:25:42] authority amen born of a
[2:25:46] woman and a man open the seals
[2:25:51] for God when we say the only worthy one
[2:25:56] was the Lord Jesus Christ blood lamb but
[2:25:59] we see brother say today this morning in
[2:26:05] front of this
[2:26:06] pit opening
[2:26:09] [Applause]
[2:26:13] the if you can find out you might
[2:26:17] realize that half of the church that day
[2:26:21] never came back the
[2:26:25] next as I'm saying we need to be
[2:26:29] realistic the pastor stand behind the
[2:26:32] and say we are going to the
[2:26:35] uttermost to save the
[2:26:38] people after
[2:26:40] service many went
[2:26:45] [Applause]
[2:26:48] back God can cannot start his journey
[2:26:52] with his man and along the way just
[2:26:55] leave
[2:26:56] him that is not God that was something
[2:27:00] else but if God started a journey with
[2:27:03] you he will make sure you will finish
[2:27:07] [Applause]
[2:27:13] that I remember one day I preached here
[2:27:18] behind this ppit about
[2:27:20] the deliberate way of God for downsizing
[2:27:25] the
[2:27:28] people if this church is overflowing and
[2:27:33] God wanted to
[2:27:34] downsize he will do it those that do not
[2:27:37] belong here they will go out and never
[2:27:40] come
[2:27:43] back if brother did it and Jesus did it
[2:27:48] who are we will give the message in
[2:27:52] front of this P that will make ours
[2:27:56] others to go and not come
[2:27:59] back not our duty it's God Judy because
[2:28:04] this p is blessed by God himself it's
[2:28:08] God talking behind this addressing you
[2:28:12] even now if someone decided de God bless
[2:28:16] you
[2:28:20] this is the time we are living in where
[2:28:23] we cannot hide ourselves where we need
[2:28:26] to pursue what God has put in our heart
[2:28:31] for Judas for Judas to be long in the
[2:28:35] message and be with Jesus does not make
[2:28:38] him a Christian does not take him to
[2:28:41] heaven but one of the days Jesus will
[2:28:45] turn around and said to
[2:28:48] me this cut is
[2:28:51] [Applause]
[2:28:55] do that which is in your heart we have
[2:28:57] things in our heart we are hiding them
[2:29:00] because of some other reason but one of
[2:29:03] the days that will
[2:29:06] best and will see your true
[2:29:10] colors the people have colors but one
[2:29:13] day you will see the true
[2:29:18] color the true color
[2:29:20] when you take a decision and the one you
[2:29:25] worship visited you you know Pharaoh I
[2:29:29] was reading the history of pharaoh not
[2:29:32] not in the Bible but as Egypt somewhere
[2:29:35] in the library I was checking how
[2:29:38] Pharaoh was good and I was convinced at
[2:29:43] well I was convinced as well Pharaoh was
[2:29:46] a good
[2:29:48] man as good as he was
[2:29:50] but he was
[2:29:52] ordained for
[2:29:54] dnation when that moment come he won't
[2:29:58] hide
[2:29:59] it Pharaoh Even Called Moses Moses pray
[2:30:04] for me Moses prayed for Pharaoh so that
[2:30:08] all those plates can
[2:30:12] stop amen amen but God said there should
[2:30:16] be 10 you you pray when Moses you will
[2:30:21] pray for Pharaoh but the plagues before
[2:30:24] God are 10 if he come eight or n they
[2:30:30] are not enough they should be 10 then
[2:30:33] phara will call
[2:30:36] Moses Moses you know me I know you were
[2:30:41] eating together but now you punishing me
[2:30:44] to your for
[2:30:47] me will put hands on him and that hands
[2:30:51] that's not going to stop the plague that
[2:30:54] God has for
[2:30:55] [Applause]
[2:30:58] Pharaoh then the last play
[2:31:01] came and God said
[2:31:03] Moses enough is enough I am the one
[2:31:07] who's doing this you don't have to worry
[2:31:10] I do
[2:31:16] them we are not an exemption to that
[2:31:23] amen amen same thing will happen
[2:31:26] today as many as we
[2:31:29] are other people have their own
[2:31:32] agenda you won't know it until it's
[2:31:35] visible and what I know about this
[2:31:40] message the more you come to church the
[2:31:43] more you follow sheep the more you are
[2:31:45] like Pharaoh one of the days you will be
[2:31:48] exposed
[2:31:49] [Applause]
[2:31:59] I hope I tell you that you must stream
[2:32:00] as
[2:32:01] well I hope I told you you must live
[2:32:05] stream especially on Wednesday because
[2:32:10] 56 hits on a Wednesday
[2:32:14] streaming while we are more than
[2:32:17] 2,000 come on what will you
[2:32:21] [Music]
[2:32:25] doing because I learned from that I was
[2:32:29] not in Congo when the pastor was
[2:32:31] preaching but they captured it it's now
[2:32:34] here my own benefit because when I was
[2:32:37] listening when the pastor was saying
[2:32:40] something in me has met me I will
[2:32:45] [Music]
[2:32:47] say I will do like because I need to be
[2:32:51] a follower and a very good
[2:32:56] follower while you are denying
[2:33:00] that I'm
[2:33:03] benefiting amen am unveiling of God
[2:33:07] unveiling God amen amen
[2:33:11] unveiling that means something that was
[2:33:13] Veil and when he unveil when I read this
[2:33:17] book as I'm closing when I read this
[2:33:20] book away go and read it the more God is
[2:33:26] unveiled when you read fa in a man when
[2:33:29] you read a in a man you end up saying
[2:33:33] then God is a
[2:33:35] man the other day he said as he was
[2:33:38] walking a certain Minister came to him
[2:33:41] and
[2:33:42] said the people are making God out of
[2:33:46] you that means you can write another
[2:33:48] Bible brother Bram could take the spirit
[2:33:52] in him but he came very
[2:33:55] nice then brother Bram says I mustn't
[2:33:58] add or subract from the Bible but what
[2:34:02] the people say about me is not far from
[2:34:04] the
[2:34:07] [Applause]
[2:34:12] truth now brother is God then I listen
[2:34:16] to the P he said we are
[2:34:20] God the god whom we cannot worship but
[2:34:24] if you individualize him as what say and
[2:34:29] attack it you miss the mark because our
[2:34:33] pastor should be the waving
[2:34:36] sheep you know you know what is a waving
[2:34:39] sheep something will P up there and look
[2:34:44] up to it and be like it what he says is
[2:34:49] what he have
[2:34:55] remember
[2:34:56] say and uh yes some other things I take
[2:35:00] them to
[2:35:02] task with other friends of mine not to
[2:35:06] everybody others were saying you worship
[2:35:09] your pastor but I said to him you know
[2:35:13] what I didn't know
[2:35:16] Jesus when I went to church that's when
[2:35:19] I went to
[2:35:21] I didn't
[2:35:22] know but if this man has showed me
[2:35:26] brother follow
[2:35:30] him and when I follow him one of the
[2:35:34] days what
[2:35:36] he
[2:35:42] will that is the seven when you see God
[2:35:46] in a man and follow that man that cause
[2:35:51] in that man will end up being
[2:35:57] you well if that is the case and the
[2:36:01] pastor started preaching it will be
[2:36:04] amen amen amen to
[2:36:10] amen
