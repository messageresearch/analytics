[0:31] Because uh we we have seen in the book
[0:34] here.
[0:38] Um, a man that can turn on the light.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; I think it's page 32.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Page 32.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Uh, h it speaks of east and west here.
[0:57] Uh when you are born,
[1:01] &gt;&gt; life itself when you are bo I mean when
[1:04] you are born is like the sun.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; You go right onto the setting of the
[1:11] sun.
[1:15] From your birth to the setting of the
[1:17] sun. From your birth
[1:21] to the setting of the sun. having
[1:26] &gt;&gt; men.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:32] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:34] Setting of the sun.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Man has traveled westward always.
[1:47] The oldest civilization we have is China
[1:50] in the east countries.
[1:57] Jerusalem.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; And she keeps traveling westward
[2:04] as it goes
[2:07] and uh on and on to the west.
[2:13] You saw
[2:15] I'm trying to pick up one page here
[2:21] where it says
[2:24] when the when Junior Jackson
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson
[2:28] &gt;&gt; in his vision or or dream.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Uh now the prophet coming interpreting
[2:35] the dream because he saw a vision.
[2:43] Now Junior Jackson saw the prophet
[2:45] chopping off the top of the pyramid.
[2:53] I don't know if they have fixed that.
[2:56] What's name of mine where I
[3:00] ask for last time
[3:06] because I ran away when the thing was
[3:08] not ready and I had asked for it.
[3:17] Amen. Amen. But let me read to you these
[3:20] things.
[3:23] You'll forgive me. I have some plenty of
[3:25] this and that.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; Now is east.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; You know the major has met the prophet
[3:39] and they said you won't be successful in
[3:42] the east.
[3:48] Uh
[3:49] &gt;&gt; because
[3:52] truly he is not successful in the EAST
[3:58] &gt;&gt; because in the east now
[4:02] &gt;&gt; was another
[4:04] is another dispensation.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when the young man, the
[4:13] young prophet appeared in Jerusalem,
[4:20] uh he was so he he he seemed like a
[4:25] successful man
[4:29] healing the sick.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he found favor with men.
[4:40] But then
[4:42] &gt;&gt; when the time arrived
[4:46] &gt;&gt; for uh manifestation,
[4:52] &gt;&gt; he was not successful.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Even in the at the cross there were only
[5:00] FEW
[5:07] the resurrection day,
[5:12] &gt;&gt; a a lone woman,
[5:16] she came running with a message, the
[5:19] message that he is risen.
[5:26] Amen. Amen. So if you look now
[5:31] the the magi,
[5:33] you read in your book says is this the
[5:35] time
[5:37] is
[5:37] &gt;&gt; the magi met him
[5:41] and they said you were born under a
[5:43] sign.
[5:48] Now the prophet says
[5:51] you have a sign
[5:54] and a commission.
[5:58] Now he says the the people believe a
[6:00] SIGN
[6:03] as the Lord Jesus said also
[6:06] does this generation
[6:10] come this generation want to see a sign.
[6:16] Now the prophet of God say
[6:21] it's a sign
[6:24] but he says a sign
[6:26] &gt;&gt; it's like when you are standing on top
[6:29] of the mountain
[6:33] looking to the other side
[6:38] and you see a city.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. then then you will you will start
[6:48] off now for the city.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Now he says
[6:57] &gt;&gt; um if you come
[7:00] against um a SIGNPOST
[7:05] and then it tells you JOHANNESBURG
[7:10] JOHANNESBURG.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Now the signpost signpost.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Uh, it's not your absolute.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; It's pointing. It's pointing you to
[7:23] &gt;&gt; a destination.
[7:28] Amen.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; You only have a destiny. Now you need a
[7:32] to reach
[7:34] &gt;&gt; the destination.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; So now he says now a signpost
[7:43] is pointing you to the place where you
[7:45] should be.
[7:51] Now you don't rally and worship around a
[7:53] signpost
[7:59] is pointing you out to something.
[8:04] And that's why John
[8:07] a signpost
[8:09] pointed them to Jesus.
[8:15] Amen.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4,
[8:18] &gt;&gt; a signpost.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; He came and said, "I am not him."
[8:27] &gt;&gt; He pointed the bride.
[8:35] Behold,
[8:38] &gt;&gt; now the prophet says,
[8:41] "It's time to leave the signpost for the
[8:44] city."
[8:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[8:51] AMEN.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Now people rallied around John
[8:58] and John said, "I am not him.
[9:03] Amen.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; He was before me
[9:07] and he's coming after me.
[9:10] Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is a sign.
[9:16] But the prophet says
[9:18] it is from the sign to the commission.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet has sent us a
[9:28] God has sent us a prophet.
[9:32] That is good.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; For what?
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Just to is it just to pull out of
[9:44] denomination?
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Then after pulling out what?
[9:52] Get baptized in the name of the Lord
[9:54] Jesus Christ.
[9:57] Then after the baptism, what?
[10:03] They came. They saw John.
[10:06] They admired the ministry of John.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; And what?
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; So, so it's the same thing even today.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; They they they they delighted at the
[10:25] sight of the signpost.
[10:30] but not the commission.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; So that's why your book says is this the
[10:36] time
[10:39] &gt;&gt; speaks of the new commission.
[10:46] He says the angel
[10:49] after the the the book that is written
[10:52] within is closed
[10:57] then that angel sees us
[11:02] and then he says it's now time for the
[11:04] seven thunders m ministry.
[11:12] So you have two sides of the same
[11:15] messenger.
[11:21] One side as a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:23] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:23] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:23] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:24] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:24] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:24] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:24] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:24] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[11:25] a a a a a a a a a a was what's name? One
[11:26] side as a church as as a start to the
[11:29] church
[11:34] and then let me show you another side.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Now the people can come to this side of
[11:41] the prophet
[11:45] and he missed the other side
[11:49] because the the announcement of the
[11:51] angel says
[11:54] the time shall be no more.
[11:58] So he chose two things there.
[12:02] Time is church ages
[12:06] and another the announcement also
[12:10] skips to the time shall be no more.
[12:17] Now you come through the seven churches
[12:21] to the seven seals. Seven seals.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the seven church ages
[12:27] &gt;&gt; seven church ages
[12:28] &gt;&gt; is men.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; The seven seals
[12:31] &gt;&gt; seven
[12:32] &gt;&gt; is an angel.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; So I have my angel.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; I have my angel.
[12:44] You you have your angel.
[12:49] And the prophet says
[12:51] that angel
[12:53] comes to you.
[12:55] And he says
[12:57] &gt;&gt; that is eternity.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Now, now you must look in your Bible.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; In your Bible,
[13:10] I'll take Galatians,
[13:13] &gt;&gt; the book of Galatians, chapter 3.
[13:16] Chapter
[13:17] &gt;&gt; 3.
[13:20] I'm looking at this. Uh uh. Is that
[13:23] Galatians? Yes. Yes. Yes.
[13:27] Pardon me.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; My my thin uh
[13:35] pages. Chapter 3.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Chapter 3.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 19.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 19.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Wherefore then the law, it was added
[13:44] because of transgressions
[13:46] till the seed should come to whom the
[13:49] promise was made. And it was ordained by
[13:53] angels
[13:54] in the hand of the mediator.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Verse 19.
[14:13] Amen.
[14:22] Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:26] Now,
[14:30] till the seed should come to whom the
[14:32] promise was made
[14:37] and it was ordained
[14:42] by angels.
[14:45] Now part of the seven churches
[14:50] John John said says I heard the voice
[14:54] and I tend
[14:58] to see the voice
[15:01] and he says now in the midst of the
[15:03] seven lampstands
[15:07] he saw the one who had seven stars IN
[15:11] HIS HAND.
[15:16] AND THE interpretation of the stars is
[15:19] the seven angels to the seven churches.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Now in the midst of the seven lampstands
[15:33] he saw him
[15:35] with seven stars.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; So now the seven stars in his right hand
[15:47] was a mystery.
[15:53] Amen.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Then he when it was disclosed to John
[15:59] said this is the angels of the seven
[16:02] church ages.
[16:06] Seven church ages. Now here it says
[16:11] &gt;&gt; till the seed should come to whom the
[16:14] promise was made
[16:21] and it was ordained by angels.
[16:29] Amen. Now at the end of the seven church
[16:32] ages
[16:34] ages,
[16:34] &gt;&gt; we see the ordination of angels.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; And now these seven angels,
[16:45] &gt;&gt; there was one angel
[16:49] to the seven.
[16:55] Uh you are looking at one angel
[16:59] but they were seven angels.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; They were seven angels.
[17:08] But the prophet
[17:10] ended up looking at one angel
[17:15] which is
[17:17] the angel with the seventh seal.
[17:25] the angel with the seven seal.
[17:33] Amen. Um now
[17:40] east
[17:42] before beforeh
[17:48] because you have seven days
[17:53] &gt;&gt; and um h that's why the Bible says
[17:58] in the book of Mark
[18:03] uh on the Sabbath day, the end of the
[18:05] seventh day.
[18:10] Then Mary Magdalene
[18:13] at the end of the
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Sabbath
[18:18] because Sabbath is the seventh day.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll find it here, but I
[18:27] think it's Marks Mark 16.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Mark 16.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] And when the Sabbath, that's verse one,
[18:36] Mark 16.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; And when the Sabbath was passed,
[18:41] which Sabbath speaks of seven church
[18:43] ages,
[18:45] seven church ages. When the Sabbath was
[18:48] passed,
[18:50] &gt;&gt; when the seven days were passed,
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
[18:58] James and Saleom had bought sweet spices
[19:02] that they might come and anoint him.
[19:14] Amen. Amen. Now that was from the end of
[19:18] the seventh day
[19:22] to the first to the first day.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Now they traveled from the end of the
[19:30] seventh day
[19:34] and they couldn't see him until the
[19:37] first day.
[19:42] Amen. He was only seen on the first day
[19:48] which the prophet says
[19:52] which was
[19:55] Sunday morning
[19:59] which the prophet again says
[20:02] it is again the eighth day.
[20:08] Amen. the the first day
[20:11] is also the eighth day.
[20:16] That's why the Bible speaks of the holy
[20:18] CONVOCATION
[20:21] on the eighth day
[20:24] and the first day.
[20:27] So you have the first day
[20:30] which is the holy convocation
[20:33] you have it as the the eighth day.
[20:39] Now, now with the Jews
[20:42] &gt;&gt; as we saw it in in Kinasa,
[20:46] &gt;&gt; the Jews
[20:48] because they they refused him.
[20:52] Now their ministry was from Sabbath to
[20:55] Sabbath.
[21:02] They couldn't go further.
[21:06] They will start a Sabbath
[21:09] to the end of Sabbath
[21:12] and start another Sabbath.
[21:15] But Mary Magdalene
[21:18] traveled from the Sabbath to the first
[21:20] day
[21:25] and never to celebrate Sabbath again.
[21:31] That was after the end of the Sabbath.
[21:38] Now the Jews,
[21:41] they failed to see him after the
[21:44] Sabbath.
[21:47] And Mary Magdalene
[21:50] saw him after the Sabbath
[21:55] which was the first day
[21:59] which was the eighth day
[22:03] which speaks of eternity.
[22:07] That's why the people today, THE PEOPLE
[22:10] TODAY, they are traveling from a church
[22:13] age to church age. Church age to church,
[22:17] &gt;&gt; never to the seven seals.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's church AGE TO CHURCH AGE.
[22:25] CHURCH. When they hit the seventh church
[22:28] age,
[22:30] &gt;&gt; they go back to the first church age
[22:31] again
[22:33] and and they they speak of miracles and
[22:36] and wonders and all those things.
[22:41] Not they never reach the third pool
[22:46] where the Lord said I will meet you in
[22:48] there.
[22:52] So that means they have never met the
[22:55] Lord.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; But Mary Magdalene
[23:02] after the Sabbath,
[23:04] she traveled to the first day
[23:07] where she met the Lord.
[23:11] You see, not Sabbath to Sabbath,
[23:16] but Sabbath to a holy convocation.
[23:24] Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[23:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Last thing here.
[23:35] Uh
[23:37] now why the reason
[23:40] &gt;&gt; the question is the reason
[23:45] &gt;&gt; and
[23:47] and that's why the people
[23:52] &gt;&gt; they just failed to see the seven sins
[23:58] &gt;&gt; because
[24:00] no man
[24:03] &gt;&gt; was worthy.
[24:07] Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:10] As we read,
[24:13] &gt;&gt; I won't go back to Thursday, but
[24:18] the prophet says
[24:21] &gt;&gt; man was separated from his theophony
[24:29] and he just came down as a spirit
[24:34] &gt;&gt; because
[24:36] a body of the word.
[24:40] So he bypassed the word.
[24:46] This is the spot where the prophet used
[24:48] to say h that eternal a spot of
[24:51] eternity.
[24:58] A brand name saw a brand name.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; And he calls that one spot of eternity.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; It's not only a brand name and a brand.
[25:21] It's you and
[25:24] &gt;&gt; and you
[25:29] &gt;&gt; now as men bypassed
[25:34] &gt;&gt; the theophony
[25:38] which in that theophony he is worthy.
[25:49] A man bypassed that part.
[25:54] That's that's the reason he was not
[25:56] worthy
[26:02] to open the book.
[26:06] What made him so is he bypassed the
[26:09] theophony.
[26:14] Now for him to be worthy
[26:18] he must connect back to the
[26:27] &gt;&gt; then this makes him a 100% being
[26:33] and this makes him worthy
[26:41] &gt;&gt; because he's he's now part of God.
[26:45] And God brought things before Adam
[26:50] and Adam could name them.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; But after sin.
[26:59] Now this part
[27:01] which comes through the seven church
[27:03] ages
[27:05] churches
[27:05] &gt;&gt; was found not worthy
[27:10] &gt;&gt; to open the seals because the seals
[27:15] is something beyond time.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; But only theophony is beyond time.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Now that's why if you you read in the
[27:31] Bible
[27:33] Paul says
[27:35] &gt;&gt; when this one shall dissolve,
[27:39] &gt;&gt; we have another
[27:43] We we have another
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Paul tells you that
[27:53] &gt;&gt; this one
[27:55] &gt;&gt; is is just uh
[27:58] it's something that will that will
[28:01] vanish or or or what do you call now?
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Something that will die.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; This body
[28:12] Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; But he says,
[28:15] &gt;&gt; but when this one shall dissolve,
[28:18] &gt;&gt; when this one is dissolved,
[28:22] &gt;&gt; then we have
[28:25] &gt;&gt; and I'll show what the prophet says
[28:26] here.
[28:30] Now here it says just maybe five
[28:33] minutes.
[28:35] Uh look at this now.
[28:38] Now that's why now we have uh we we went
[28:42] through this that that that's why we
[28:43] have two parts of things
[28:48] &gt;&gt; two forms of one body
[28:54] and I find myself wanting uh in this
[28:58] part.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh now brother Brenham
[29:09] &gt;&gt; after he had seen the thunders blast
[29:15] because he even says I went west for a
[29:18] blast.
[29:23] Now after seeing h
[29:26] hearing the blast
[29:30] then he says he saw something
[29:34] but he says I didn't understand
[29:40] then I look for interpretation
[29:45] now that part
[29:48] could not interpret the white stone
[29:54] this part.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; So he started to look for
[29:58] interpretation.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Now that is the reason.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Then he was taken he he went west.
[30:13] Now the the interpretation
[30:17] &gt;&gt; came when he connected the angel's
[30:20] message.
[30:25] He says, "I stood there looking into
[30:29] ETERNITY
[30:33] and he saw the angels coming now not
[30:35] from the church ages but from eternity.
[30:45] So that is beyond time.
[30:50] So his subconscious
[30:54] &gt;&gt; picked up the picture.
[30:58] Then he says
[31:01] and counting from left when the uh the
[31:04] angels in a constellation
[31:08] &gt;&gt; came down.
[31:10] and they count him from left
[31:13] &gt;&gt; to right to the one that picked him up.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; He says that is the seventh.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Now here's the seventh angel messenger
[31:30] &gt;&gt; and he's counting
[31:34] &gt;&gt; and the seventh
[31:36] &gt;&gt; is the seventh angel. Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody spiritual.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Here's the seventh angel messenger.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Seven angel messenger.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; A messenger to the church ages
[31:51] agency.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; A part that could that was not worthy to
[31:55] open the sins.
[32:00] Then as the angels lowered THEMSELVES
[32:06] from eternity
[32:08] which is another part.
[32:12] Then he started counting in the
[32:14] CONSTELLATION
[32:18] and he looked at this seventh one
[32:22] that it was notable.
[32:29] And he says the others were
[32:32] &gt;&gt; ordinary
[32:37] &gt;&gt; because all the ANGELS
[32:41] of all the angels one was the spokes
[32:45] angel.
[32:51] You know it it is like how they lead the
[32:54] the lampstands
[32:58] the lambs.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; That's how they lit the first one.
[33:06] Then they took that one,
[33:09] lit the second one and put that one back
[33:12] in its place and take the second one and
[33:15] lit the third one and put this one in
[33:17] its place and take the third one and
[33:19] lead that one and put it in its place.
[33:23] Amen.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; It was not like they lead this one and
[33:27] this one.
[33:29] No, it's one light
[33:33] from the first from the first lamp
[33:37] to the seventh.
[33:41] The other six,
[33:44] they receive their light from the first.
[33:50] So, one angel open up
[33:55] and the thing runs through the seven.
[34:03] That's why I can show you in the Bible
[34:05] that you are a sevenfold being yourself
[34:13] because the revelation must run down
[34:15] through the seven.
[34:21] Amen. When God comes to you,
[34:24] he must come through the the the seven
[34:28] down the seven.
[34:31] And the Bible says if you don't have
[34:33] seven vuh
[34:39] even you are blind, you can't see a far
[34:42] off.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; If you don't have
[34:54] That means
[34:56] &gt;&gt; the faculty for seeing
[35:00] &gt;&gt; is seven s
[35:04] things.
[35:06] If you lack seven things,
[35:10] the Bible says you can't see a far.
[35:16] If you see 56
[35:23] then you have a blare vision.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] But if you can see seven
[35:39] then if you come to to to the seventh
[35:42] SPOT
[35:45] &gt;&gt; then you can you can see beyond
[35:51] &gt;&gt; that's why after the seven
[35:54] &gt;&gt; the Bible says
[35:57] revelation chapter 4
[35:58] &gt;&gt; revelation 4
[36:00] &gt;&gt; the word says John
[36:02] &gt;&gt; come forth
[36:05] and I will show you
[36:09] &gt;&gt; things that will be here after.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; And uh John was summoned up the mountain
[36:19] again
[36:21] by the seventh angel
[36:25] by the seventh angel a seventh angel
[36:30] and said, "Come up higher.
[36:33] And he says he took me to the highest
[36:35] mountain,
[36:40] &gt;&gt; not to the first pool,
[36:43] &gt;&gt; to the highest mountain.
[36:47] And then he says, "Then I saw the new
[36:50] Jerusalem."
[36:55] Now he stood on an earthly mountain.
[37:02] to see a supernatural Jerusalem.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says you hit seven,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; then where are you going?
[37:19] &gt;&gt; If you are not taken in into the king's
[37:22] chamber,
[37:25] &gt;&gt; you are going back.
[37:30] Amen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; That's why today
[37:33] we have the people who don't believe in
[37:36] the five-fold ministerfold
[37:41] minister.
[37:43] They won't even bother to come to the
[37:45] service because to them a pastor is
[37:47] nothing. They also have a ministry.
[37:57] Do you know we have such people
[38:04] they don't care
[38:07] &gt;&gt; come Sunday
[38:10] they are thinking of preaching somewhere
[38:18] they don't care
[38:20] they they don't believe in fivefold
[38:24] ministry.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Fivefold ministry.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; They make their own callers.
[38:37] I've seen I've seen many ships with
[38:39] colors now wearing colors.
[38:43] I've seen many ships
[38:47] wearing collars.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; I even know their names.
[38:59] Now
[39:01] &gt;&gt; how I how we know them?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; It is because every time they make a
[39:06] sound, it goes me.
[39:16] Have you ever heard a a a shepherd
[39:22] giving out such a sound.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Me has no interpretation.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; They asked the brother,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; they asked him,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; they asked the brother last uh se last
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Easter
[39:53] How was the conference?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Now this new pastor was preaching
[40:01] &gt;&gt; to me is a sheep.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Now as he was preaching
[40:09] now our deacon asked the brother how was
[40:12] the meeting?
[40:16] He says
[40:18] you know he was just talking
[40:25] And people enjoy man.
[40:34] Let me promise here.
[40:38] You get what I mean?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; You know you as in the Lord, you must
[40:42] grow to a stage
[40:46] to a point where you can distinguish
[40:49] be between the sheep and the shepherd.
[40:58] There's some sheeps
[41:02] sometimes,
[41:03] another sheep
[41:05] can just buy a caller.
[41:09] I mean spiritual caller
[41:12] because you have the natural and the
[41:14] spiritual callers.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Now you can just get a caller.
[41:20] wear it
[41:23] and the other ships will follow you
[41:30] again.
[41:33] It's a very strange you know
[41:39] you've been doing me together
[41:46] &gt;&gt; only another sheep
[41:50] uh
[41:52] he starts to make a sophisticated man.
[42:00] Then you follow him.
[42:03] But the Bible says my sheep, the Lord
[42:05] says my sheep know my voice.
[42:15] a new color sheep they won't follow
[42:23] &gt;&gt; because they know
[42:26] &gt;&gt; the voice
[42:28] &gt;&gt; the voice is a spiritual signitual
[42:34] sign.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I can hear the voice of the
[42:38] prophet.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; I can hear the voice of the prophet.
[42:45] That's why I have these books here.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; To indicate that
[42:55] I have a prophet
[42:59] &gt;&gt; and I I I've heard the voice.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Now I'm here for a manifestation.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Man has traveled Can I take five?
[43:16] Man has traveled eastward always.
[43:22] But now coming back
[43:25] to east again.
[43:27] Then this is the evening light.
[43:33] That is a man that can turn on the
[43:35] light.
[43:38] A man that can turn on the light.
[43:43] Page 33.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Page 33.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Right. And then it says,
[43:49] &gt;&gt; "Just like the sun,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; just like the sun,
[43:54] &gt;&gt; the s u n su n
[43:57] &gt;&gt; has traveled like the s o n.
[44:03] The church has come to the same from
[44:06] seven church ages.
[44:10] forth civilization moved right on to the
[44:14] WEST
[44:17] and the church has moved right onto the
[44:19] west.
[44:22] And now if we go any further
[44:26] then where are we now?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; We come back east again.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So you leave the WEST COAST
[44:35] COAST
[44:35] &gt;&gt; go right back into China
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Japan. right back again
[44:43] &gt;&gt; to the east again.
[44:45] So east and west has met.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Now it's a complete thing,
[44:56] a a complete lied.
[45:01] And the reason I went west
[45:06] to I had to go west to connect with the
[45:09] angel's message. This angel's MESSAGE
[45:16] NOW DON'T forget that the seven seal me
[45:19] message is is the angel's message.
[45:26] I went to connect with the angel's
[45:28] message
[45:31] to come back here
[45:34] east
[45:36] to reveal it to the church.
[45:40] Oh, I think you understand. You won't
[45:42] try to take your car and go east.
[45:46] We are talking about supernatural
[45:47] things.
[45:51] We are talking about spiritual things.
[45:56] So God showed it naturally
[45:59] when he placed men eastward
[46:03] and he shows it spiritually.
[46:07] And this east place, east gate
[46:12] That's where Abel and
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Cain worshiped.
[46:20] And that's where God placed the cherubim
[46:22] with a sword
[46:26] to guard the way of the tree of life
[46:31] which the prophet says that Satan don't
[46:34] understand it.
[46:37] He understands the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.
[46:42] BUT NOT THE tree of life.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So the the the prophet open UP
[46:51] so he went west
[46:54] as he said
[46:57] Junior Jackson says after he chopped the
[46:59] top
[47:01] after he saw the prophet chopping the
[47:04] top
[47:06] he said look down in
[47:10] And he said, "Stay here
[47:13] until I return."
[47:17] Amen.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; But when he returned,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; he found only few.
[47:26] The rest had gone on
[47:29] because the major said,
[47:32] "You shall not be successful IN THE
[47:35] EAST.
[47:39] That's why
[47:41] there is only few now
[47:48] &gt;&gt; in the sales dispensation.
[47:53] So I came back to reveal it.
[47:58] I came back to reveal it
[48:02] to the church.
[48:07] And the angel who flew to me
[48:14] &gt;&gt; was the seventh seal angel.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And now
[48:26] &gt;&gt; that's why when they when he opened the
[48:29] seven, it was silent. Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; The angels stopped
[48:40] &gt;&gt; because they were used to something.
[48:46] They had seen God the Almighty.
[48:51] They had seen men
[48:55] made lower.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] to to be tested and so forth.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Now when the thing connected back again
[49:08] together,
[49:12] then the angel stopped.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[49:24] I
[49:25] love him
[49:28] because
[49:31] he faced
[49:35] me
[49:37] and
[49:40] chased my
[49:44] salvation.
[49:50] All
[50:13] right.
