[9:51] all the St of a
[9:54] man the St of a man is in three
[10:04] [Music]
[10:08] preservation we should
[10:10] preserve the body preserved The Body
[10:13] Spirit and the Soul
[10:18] preserved until the day
[10:21] of until he
[10:23] comes amen amen now that's why you'll
[10:28] wonder at something
[10:30] I will read it to you I will be able to
[10:33] read all these things but I can read few
[10:36] of
[10:37] them now it says
[10:40] here uh now you are in a cycle of
[10:47] three amen it's a cycle like
[10:51] this a cycle of
[10:54] three oh maybe white amen a Cy like this
[11:02] but like
[11:06] this like this amen like this yes amen
[11:11] amen and uh it's a cycle of
[11:15] three but it's a
[11:18] cycle it says so here you are one person
[11:23] like Father Son and Holy Ghost a cycle
[11:26] of three
[11:29] but one
[11:32] person so God dwells in a St of a
[11:37] man that is a cycle of
[11:40] three but it's one
[11:43] person the body the spirit the soul but
[11:48] it's one
[11:50] thing all right am just like he says at
[11:54] that day you shall know that I'm in the
[11:56] father and you in me and I in you it's a
[12:01] cycle of
[12:03] three so the whole thing is one
[12:07] thing is God but in this God uh he says
[12:12] you shall know that I am in my father
[12:16] and you in me and I in you now I in you
[12:21] comes the
[12:24] last
[12:26] because that is the destination of God
[12:31] the now he dwells in a St now the St is
[12:36] in
[12:40] a amen amen that's
[12:50] why then it's
[12:54] a now is not a stage it's only in the
[12:58] mind it's not
[12:59] is the first stage of
[13:01] it because it is it must come in a
[13:05] threefold
[13:08] man now the
[13:11] only now the dwelling place of
[13:15] God is
[13:19] threefold now listen what he says
[13:22] here uhuh you know you know you can't
[13:25] keep God in one thing
[13:30] no God dwells in a
[13:32] St that's why the prophet speaks of H
[13:36] the threefold
[13:40] Revelation but let me run it quickly
[13:43] here oh here it says where is
[13:46] it you are in a cycle of
[13:50] three
[13:52] what but one
[13:55] person three attributes of one person
[14:00] like just three offices of
[14:02] God fatherhood sunship and Holy
[14:07] Ghost amen amen
[14:10] now if you dwell in God you dwell in a
[14:18] threefold a cycle of
[14:20] three which makes him
[14:23] God Father Son and Holy
[14:26] Ghost which makes makes him God
[14:30] amen amen because the Bible says now you
[14:34] dwell in a cycle of
[14:36] three Liv in God you are in a cycle of
[14:41] three at that day you shall know that I
[14:44] am in
[14:46] the and you in me and I in you so you
[14:50] are in a cycle of
[14:54] three now the dwelling place of
[14:57] God is a cycle
[15:02] of God can dwell in your
[15:06] head then you become a
[15:10] theologian he has
[15:12] to come
[15:15] into the
[15:18] C of
[15:20] three don't try to read I I will read
[15:23] you some but you can try if you
[15:26] can I'll read you first second Epistles
[15:30] Second
[15:32] Epistle uh verse
[15:37] 9 ver nine nine that is second
[15:44] at whosoever
[15:47] transgresses and abideth not in the
[15:49] doctrine of Christ hath not
[15:53] God he that abideth in the doctrine of
[15:56] of Christ he has both the father
[16:08] and you see C of
[16:11] three it's you the Father the Son is
[16:17] you it's a cycle of
[16:20] three so that's why it says God dwells
[16:24] in the in the St of a man am he
[16:31] occupies the
[16:36] threefold of a man threefold yeah
[16:40] threefold of a
[16:43] man man in his three-fold
[16:46] manner that's where God
[16:50] dwells I was reading something here you
[16:52] listen to it the spirit can come out of
[16:56] here and anoint you
[17:00] and do certain
[17:02] things and uh anoint you to do a certain
[17:09] thing but that don't mean you are
[17:14] safe because is just a part
[17:18] of it's not
[17:21] God God can say do this and you do that
[17:25] thing but we are not talking about that
[17:28] we are talking about who you
[17:34] are you get what I mean amen and then
[17:38] because the last thing that will
[17:42] happen is when it shall be revealed that
[17:47] who I am and who you
[17:50] are not what you
[17:53] are who you
[17:56] are and you won't be
[18:00] surprised if I read this thing here that
[18:04] at the end of it all the whole thing is
[18:07] is called
[18:10] Christ amen amen amen a man would be
[18:14] able to say I am
[18:20] Christ okay
[18:24] amen it will scare off a luan
[18:36] [Music]
[18:38] radi
[18:42] says I always check what they
[18:46] saying and Jesus also check and what
[18:49] does the people
[18:52] say what is Da talking about
[18:56] me he wanted to hear what the people
[18:59] were
[19:01] say they said
[19:04] no prophet and you are
[19:08] that say you heard what now you what are
[19:12] you
[19:13] saying
[19:15] amen what do you say all right amen
[19:21] now now I was
[19:23] listening this man is
[19:25] asking say tell us
[19:29] here is the
[19:31] matter it
[19:33] says you cannot go straight to
[19:38] God you must start with the dead
[19:43] ones but is it possible for a person to
[19:46] go straight to
[19:48] God and one old man
[19:51] said he says I am so and
[19:54] so I say
[19:57] no it's not posible for a person to go
[19:59] straight to
[20:00] God he says God is so
[20:04] great everyone is scared of him he is
[20:08] great amen amen the only
[20:11] way to reach him is to speak to your
[20:18] ancestors because they are
[20:21] closer amen amen then they'll make for
[20:24] you an appointment for
[20:26] you with God
[20:29] then in God will speak to
[20:32] them then they will bring back the
[20:34] message to
[20:36] you and this one say
[20:39] okay so it's not
[20:41] possible he says it is not
[20:44] possible God is very very far amen
[20:50] amen now if you want to talk to him just
[20:53] go to your people people under your
[20:56] people under

[22:55] God I don't like this thing
[22:59] many
[23:02] times when people say

[23:09] because I hate the fact
[23:12] that not finding where you are going and
[23:15] who you
[23:16] are and not
[23:18] knowing do I worship
[23:21] God or am I
[23:24] compromising I don't like that thing
[23:26] that's why
[23:28] it that's why it is impossible for
[23:30] me that's why even at
[23:33] work many things I do them
[23:37] myself I want that when I work that I do
[23:41] this thing and finish it and not do it
[23:45] half so that when I don't work I don't
[23:48] work when I work let me work amen
[23:53] amen and if someone tries to work with
[23:56] me my my grandchilden
[23:59] I told them if you can't do this leave
[24:02] it because you don't have to do it

[25:39] live that's why Satanism that's why even
[25:43] Satanism they use the

[25:49] soul because with the
[25:52] soul a child can
[25:54] sit with eyes wide open not see
[25:58] anything being very very
[26:02] far because it is the soul that travels
[26:05] not the body
[26:09] not know

[26:18] far is the thing that is inside not the
[26:21] one that is
[26:24] outside now we are going toor
[26:29] one can go there very
[26:32] fast thinking that he's going very far
[26:34] he must go and
[26:36] sleep at the end of the
[26:40] day Statics if they can take statistics
[26:44] the soul
[26:46] soul it travels fast or more than
[26:49] you amen even your
[26:53] mind amen
[26:58] the soul works in the spiritual
[27:00] things your
[27:03] mind travels faster or more than your
[27:06] body and yeah he's
[27:12] faster because you're all
[27:14] here everyone can see his or house can
[27:19] you see your
[27:19] house all right amen when you
[27:23] here if you can't see your house while
[27:26] you here then you're going to get lost
[27:27] from here
[27:30] you be asking everyone I am so and so
[27:33] amen
[27:36] amen if you have the vision of your
[27:38] house inside you just go straight to
[27:41] your
[27:42] house it's your
[27:44] mind which is traveling more and faster
[27:47] than your he know where you're
[27:51] going your mind is already there but you
[27:53] are here
[27:56] [Music]
[28:03] now the one I have not been to his

[28:20] navigator I will need you as a navigator
[28:24] amen amen now
[28:26] Navigator the TR
[28:29] Navigator is here inside
[28:34] you now you see this one in the car hey
[28:38] we've got lost many
[28:40] times the certain woman saying 10
[28:52] left the
[28:53] other found himself standing in front of
[28:56] a school without anywhere woman
[28:58] directing her to
[29:01] go it is the Navigator inside is better
[29:06] all right
[29:11] amen
[29:13] amen if the soul hasn't come from
[29:17] God it it can make all the
[29:22] impersonations it cannot be real
[29:28] what I'm trying to say
[29:36] is
[29:38] uh yeah
[29:41] then spirit Spirit
[29:45] [Music]
[29:47] spirit
[29:53] amen so amen now God dwells
[29:58] in the
[30:00] St of a
[30:02] man all
[30:05] right brother says if your
[30:09] soul is not from
[30:17] God you can try all things and try to
[30:19] testify about the Holy Ghost it won't be
[30:25] real what I'm trying to say to you
[30:29] uh God cannot only be pleased to act in
[30:34] one
[30:39] place it has to be the cycle of
[30:44] three because he became himself became
[30:50] body spirit Spirit Soul amen as Jesus
[30:59] now that's why he says you can be
[31:02] anointed and do things
[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] but the one who believe the has both the
[31:15] father and the
[31:18] son it's not talking of two
[31:22] people the cycle of three it talks about
[31:25] the cycle which is how many
[31:29] one one
[31:30] amen you right amen that's
[31:33] why that day you shall know that I am in
[31:36] the father father in me and I in
[31:41] you how
[31:43] many all
[31:49] right that's why now if God dwells in a
[31:55] threefold manner
[32:00] when he comes to a
[32:02] man he dwells in that threefold
[32:05] man secret
[32:09] amen he will not dwell only in one part
[32:12] either is
[32:15] God or it's not
[32:18] God amen amen and because you don't just
[32:22] be become an
[32:24] influence no you become that way
[32:28] amen you see now that's
[32:33] why listen to what okay amen now we are
[32:38] trying to
[32:39] say that's when we can call
[32:43] ourselves minor
[32:48] Gods God operates in all the
[32:54] compartments your
[32:56] mind Mind Of
[32:59] God you see the Bible says let the mind
[33:04] which was
[33:12] in I can read it quickly that mind which
[33:16] was in
[33:18] Christ amen the mind that was in Christ
[33:22] Jes is in every believer
[33:28] amen then there is the
[33:38] soul continue with it the mind that was
[33:42] in
[33:45] Christ because
[33:49] today mind is a manifestation is no
[33:52] longer the mind is the
[33:55] manifestation amen amen it was one's
[34:00] mind today it's a
[34:02] manifestation because it says
[34:07] so if I can read it quickly it was a
[34:12] mind look what was once God's Great
[34:19] Secret in his mind is now putting the
[34:23] hearts of the believer
[34:29] amen
[34:31] Min it makes you to be a minor
[34:35] God the mind that was in
[34:38] God God's Great
[34:41] secret great mysterious
[34:44] Secret in his mind is now putting the
[34:47] hearts of the
[34:50] belever you know God makes came down and
[34:56] made himself man
[34:59] amen so that God and
[35:02] men can
[35:05] be
[35:07] equal equal in the
[35:11] form you as a Son of
[35:13] God you are in
[35:16] God worshiping
[35:20] God amen
[35:23] amen but your equalness with God
[35:28] because he is the word and he has made
[35:35] you so it's equal but in this manner
[35:40] that he is you I can't worship you you
[35:45] can't worship
[35:47] me no we are minor
[35:51] Gods amen amen
[35:54] but the center
[35:56] point is the
[35:59] Almighty which he is worshiped by the
[36:01] Min of
[36:03] God only a three-fold
[36:11] person because it
[36:13] says every knee shall
[36:16] bow in heaven on Earth and
[36:22] under so that's why the people don't
[36:25] believe the teaching that God has given
[36:28] us of the
[36:30] under because they are only
[36:37] twofold now if you are twofold you can't
[36:41] see the
[36:44] thing and God dwells in
[36:48] the brother
[36:52] says they say another brother was
[36:54] standing and saying
[36:58] they said there was there's no man who
[36:59] ever went
[37:00] down Jesus
[37:04] only now I can read for him it says
[37:08] brother says I was
[37:14] privileged to go up and
[37:17] [Applause]
[37:19] under
[37:23] listen the Bible
[37:25] says when he died we died with
[37:32] him you can say there's no one who
[37:35] died
[37:37] Jesus he says I died with you so I died
[37:41] with
[37:42] you when he resurrected I resurrected
[37:46] with
[37:47] him the Bible says
[37:50] so now if
[37:55] someone Jesus says we have resurrected
[37:58] with
[37:59] him he
[38:01] says now we are in Heavenly
[38:04] places with
[38:06] him it
[38:08] means when he left he said I'm going to
[38:11] prepare place
[38:12] for so that why and I am you two should
[38:18] be where I
[38:20] am that means if I'm in heaven you are
[38:24] also in
[38:25] heaven if I am on you are on if I'm
[38:30] under
[38:33] world see amen that's where I
[38:38] am you two should
[38:41] be you get what I mean
