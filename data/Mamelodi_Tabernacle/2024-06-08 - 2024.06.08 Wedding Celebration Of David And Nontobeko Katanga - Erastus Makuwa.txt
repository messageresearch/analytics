Title: The Marriage Manual
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Batter Boys Montana Pretoria on 
08-06-2024

Matthew 19: 1-8 | Ephesians 5: 30-33 | Genesis 1: 26-27 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the marriage manual.

Every manufacture when they produce their product they release it with the manual. Every manufacturer will have man who are trained to service the product they produced.

God is the manufacturer of marriage. Marriage is the product of God and He brought it with the manual. God trained man to service this marriage product and these are the pastors.

The manual says marriage is the oldest institution in the world. The Pharisees tempted Jesus about the product of marriage and Jesus referred them to the manual about how God made them in the beginning.

According to the manual, man alone is not the complete image of God. Because at the beginning God created them male and female. Marriage must be honourable.

Man, his wife and God were one, because they had the nature of God that made them to have one nature. 

When Jesus was walking on earth, His wife was in Him and God made Him to sleep at Calvary so He can take out His from Him. During seven church ages God was building His wife and bringing her to visibility. At the end of the seventh church age that is when the head come. 

After the manufacture manufactured this product of marriage it fell and broke. But because He is the manufacture he picked up the pieces and made it afresh.

Moses at some time also tried to service the product but it was not according to the manual.

When the product fell God took it back. Before one can marry they must be connected to their manufacture. After the fall of a man he became like an animal.

Marriage belongs to God because He is the only manufacture. The oneness in marriage is brought by God. 

Man will be the head if he is connected to his maker. Because Christ must first be the head.

you know me I'm not a long speaker I'm just going to be I'm just going to officiate but before I officiate going to read two scriptures the first scripture is Matthew Chapter 19 Verse 1 to8 verse 1 okay should I read Matthew Chapter 19 Verse 1 to8 and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Saints he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall CLE to his wife and they Tain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God have joined together let no man put a they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen amen Ephesians 5 verse 30 verse 22- 3323 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let their wives be to their own husband in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for that he might sent ify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself at glorious church not having sport or Wrangle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever had hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let everyone of you in particular so love his his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband don't have anything to them and we know you are the only one can come here and present something to them we submit ourself unto thy hand so that you can use me and my brother we pray and ask in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seat I want also to appreciate pastors who are here I'm really happy for their support I'm just going to be talk about something here um the marriage manual you see each and every manufacturer when he manufacture his product also produces a manual he can't let his product out before he can also have a manual when you buy that product you buy it with his manual if you buy a car you buy the car with the manual for you for your car to last you must always check the manual when you see the light on the dashboard you check the manual the manual will tell you what is that light what is the message but if you just go on even if there is a light on the dashboard you likely damage your car if you don't want to damage your look at the man and when the manufacturer produces his prod he also teaches people those who will service his there must be man men who will be taught how to service you will never take Nan to Toyota because there are men and Toyota there who were taught to toyot God is the manufacturer and is the manufacturer of marriage my Prophet said in the book invisible you know he said marriage is the old institution in the world I'm quoting from the manual because when he brought his product because marriage is his he brought also the manual and he trained me I am one of them who are train to service this product I'm one of them when you have a problem of your car take it to the service to the service because at the there are men who are trained to God now I'm going to quote his manual he said marriage is the old institution in the world marriage was performed first was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden I can't say anything I must call the manual because I'm trained to to check the manual if I I come with a problem in this institution in this product I check the manual that is what the manual say let's go back to Genesis because here where we Afra the Bible says this is the manual this manual says people were trying to ATT Jesus those were the Pharisees trying to tell Jesus about this product which is marriage Jesus refer them to the manual he said have you not manual that he who made them in the beginning made them man and male and female he was quoting the man I must quote where he quot where he quoted is Genesis chter 1 Genesis 1: 2626 he says God in the beginning God created man in his own [Music] image and likeness he he created male and female and called them Adam in the day they were created male and F to call them that is the man and in Genesis chapter 2 says let me go another manual see what the prophet is saying what was if and Adam were the same they were called the Adam and they were Spirit when he formed man the first time he made him in his own image and God is a spirit in the image of God created him male and female created he them and them still there was no men to te the soil then God formed Men Out of the Dust of the earth and put and put this Jew Spirit into him and that was the first Adam in other words according to the manual a man alone man alone is not the image of God it's not a complete image of God because the manual in the beginning he created them male and female then when he when a man is alone is not the complete there must be someone the female that's why Paul when come he said marriage is Honorable and it must must be kept it must be honored B must not be defiled marriage is Honorable he formed man in the from the dust of the ground he put his Creation in into his formation and Adam was lonely because one part of him was still invisible and God said it is not good when a man is alone because he's not complete then I must made him a helm in other words this manufacturer he said this is not complete I must bring another P so that this thing must be compl then he he he he he put men to a deep sleep and out of and he took one of his R and made for him a woman and he made him to wake up when he wake up it was revealed to this man that this is part of him he was not told that this is part of you but it was revealed to him man and his wife and what were one when man and his wife and God were one why were they one because they both have the nature the nature of God that nature of God made them to be one with God because they were in his mind they came from the mind of the manufacturer before the manufacturer can manufacture the product he had to have the product in his mind and he must brought that product into the invisible he must bring it to the manifestation then God brought his thought down here it was male and female they have got the the nature of God in that nature make them to be one with God then when when Jesus was moving here on Earth his wife was in him and God put him to a deep sleep on Calvary Day that he could take his his wife out of him and he took him out and during seven Church ages God was building his wife he was bringing his wife to visibility and at the end of the seven churchurch because the Bible says man is the head of the woman then end of the seven Church age where the head came down that's why Jesus brought the head of the body at the end of the seven Church age there was a man there who brought this headship because in R chapter 10 we see a the the great angel coming down with the open door where did this get this book he took it from 5 there because there was someone sitting on the throne because after the manufacturer after the manufactur manufactur the his product of marri it fell down because it was his he took it so that he can make create a fresh when it has been broken we come to this scripture here where we see Moses to service this prod but it was not according to them manufacturer that's why when the manufacturer came he referred these people to the manual after the fall this product marriage become a monster before you can get to this product you must go back to be one with the manufacturer because we have fallen when this product fell back he said I must have this I must restore it when he restored it when he was studing to restore it but let me say this before a young man and a young woman before they can be married because this product has fallen now it it is a monster because men and women Fallen then before one can marry they must be connected they must be connected to their manufactur before before they can think about they must go back be connected and connected with their manufactur otherwise if they try to marry when they are not connected because after after the fall of a man men become animal then an animal cannot marry if you marry in that position you see we have got our children who are born out of us they found us praying they joined us in prayer they seem as if they also have have received what you have received but in fact they've received nothing there because by birth you are born a sinner and you are shaped in iniquity and coming to the wor speaking Al Li it doesn't matter whether you are the daughter or the the daughter or the son of or the son or the daughter of but you are born a sinner sh iniquity coming to the W speak you come to the well being an animal and having a a nature of an animal even you are more you are better than an animal animal even is better than you an animal does not fight with his f the animal is better than this Fallen generation unless you unless you go back and be connected with the Creator you must not marry if you marry if you are not connected with your creator [Applause] that marriage will be hell on Earth no one will ever be able to sa his SE a girl must come back to the manufacturer and be connected the master here he said to them because of the hardness of your heart Moses allowed you to divorce he gave you divorce letters because this product of has fallen when the government came it said no I will build a house here this will be married house a married house they trained men there to stand to sit in that house when people get there they found men and women there called marriage officers trying to marry because the product has turned into a monster and they can't they can't do otherwise they said there is another house there after you have mared Mar you go in that one to divorce because the one who is marrying you here he has already dived he is Maring you being being already a divorced man they try they try to educate people to make them marriage counselors and they are the the worst people because they have married twice or thce but they are marriage C marriage belongs to God Amen he is the only manufacturer of marriage and he made me to be the marriage [Music] officer I not [Applause] and I won't be one when you get in that house when when people come to marriage they meet some getting out some are trying some are trying to get in what is the problem Jesus said is because of the hardness of they have not connected there is no Oneness in marriage without God amen the Oneness in marriage must be brought by God there because if you are back to God you are the child you are man of oath and your yes is yes and your no is no because you have received the way of oath you are oath yourself I'm going to let this to take an oath in fact when you let the two to take an oath you are just saying them to stay where they are already because there are people people of O if if they are connected with theallu after the marriage God tried to restore the family his family he took the marriage held there that's why when we read there we find the book the book was in the hand of manufacturer there was announcement who can take that book because if you don't take it nothing will be correct because in that book there is Mystery then it was there was an answer that the L the lion has conquered but when John look he saw the lamb taking the book and when John was looking looking after d he saw the lamp opening the book and coming down with the book and when John was looking because it was said it it took the book from the one sitting on the throne and he went to his own Throne because he want to R R the secret of the book inside his own Throne he must sit inside his own thr when he was inside his own Throne he will reveal the Mysteries inside [Applause] that when he come down in the there was a man there because that man is the one who brought the headstone to the church because he Jesus said I'm going to build my church I'm going to build my wife at the end of the seven Church ages this man received the book when he received that book he received in a form of a s that that was saying we have reached the gate then we now the the man and the woman were restored those who have fallen they are being restored now they can go back hand to hand back to the garden with with the book with the S now the S is taking us back all right let's let's come here before you can think about marriage I said you must be connected connected with your maker he said here because of the hardness of your heart but eel said before God can come back into his place in the human heart he must take that one of and give man the heart of Flesh and in that heart of Flesh because in that man who has got a stone heart there is the spirit of nature there then God said I must take this Stone take this old nature and give you another spirit then after I give you another spirit I will put my spirit because you have fallen you are fallen in TS even your heart is a stone heart cannot come nearer to that kind of heart kind of heart cannot listen to the word of God God must take that heart first and give you a soft heart the heart which can at least be able to [Music] listen after listening then God will put a new hard he put a new spirit there then after putting a new spirit he will put his spirit amen when when when this product has become like that then it is now connected back with God that's why Jesus said he who made them in the beginning made them male and and he said no one should separate the the one God has put together no one should put those put together if you marry under this condition the condition of being brought back if the man is brought back and is connected with his makeup the woman is brought back the maker then the man God can wake up the man and when the man wake up when he look he will see one like him he will say this is the bone of my bone because God will open his eyes so that he could see the one who was with him in the begin because of sin this man was born at his house and his family because of sin this woman is born G but when when they receive the way because before they can receive the way there must be a man like [Applause] who will teach them how to serve because how to serve the power because he served he he served the power the power which carried to her master you should have served the power and that power will take you to your master let us say this marriage is from God a man in this situation is a driver of this prodct he must always check the when he see something that he must go to the service man so that they can check the manual what is If he if he can go on like that with the light it means this gu is not J because if this car is yours will never go on you will never go on with if there is a problem in the marriage there is something you don't understand go to the marriage officer so that you can so that you can check the manual because the here we have read the Bible say wives submit yourself unto your own husband wives you see the wife who is connected with this makup this thing is his foot is her [Music] foot now a woman is not meant to have Anon disposition she is according to the Holy Spirit to be submissive to the m this woman I'm talking about here is the one who is connected back he supposed to be submissive to the m that is commanded of woman who is truly a female all female will be of that disposition but not no real male makes a female a d I'm good in the man but she will want to be under Authority if she is connected back she will want to be to be under author if she is brought back that is the manual for but she will want to be under Authority not the rule over the the one who is connected she will this the Bible says women submit yourself the if this manual is this manual is direct to the those who are connected but those are not connected this manual is not they want equality with me because they Fallen Fallen they don't know who they are they are male fale they don't know their position a fallen somebody doesn't know his a fallen man doesn't know whether he is a man or a woman she's always afraid she will want to be under Authority not to rule over the M for he is the head for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted any male that let the woman to take authority has also broken that image he is perverted when you come to the house find that there is sble there it seems there is no ha here you see this is my head it controls the whole the booty cannot have pain my leg cannot have P without my head knowing and my head will see to pain must be taken care man will be the head if he is connected with his maker because Christ must be the head first amen they you together with here a woman is the body man is the head when you are in the family you must know your position if you don't know your position that that thing is not their family is a family is where there is a a man there is a woman there are children each and everyone is taking his position a a child is a child woman is a woman man is a man that is the family God controls everything because he is Christ is our head and he he directs the church and the church the church is directed by him it's not Direct by somebody the Church of God always follows the manual when they place a pastor they look at the man they cannot just place a pastor without looking at the manual that church is not a church the church the pastor was placed without looking at the manual that church is not the church things must come from the manual when we do something we look at the manual then we follow the manual the word of God is the manual of marriage if you look at the manual because when you come to me being a man I've the problem at I will say you are the problem what is the manual say will go back to the manual this is the marriage manual these are the marriage man no which is not connected with God that will never be the right a man who is fallen from his position of leadership you see I was a teacher if you do something in this F they drive you away there is another company called they give you the certificate which allows you to be teacher while while you have been train you must join gives you permission certificate as a teer got another that you are in the field of teaching then when they drive you away from your position from your place where you are teaching say drive you away from your position let me I say they drive you away from your place but say drive you away from your position you have got a place and a position you are you have got you have got a position as a man you have got a place at home Hallelujah when you fall from your PL in the family God take you from your position you are no more a man you when people look at you they say you they think you are a man what has taken [Music] from then you must go back say as forgiveness you cannot go to your place before you go back to go back to God can you pick this and take it down there [Applause] when this thing is going down I would like the two to stand up am [Music] [Applause] and i' would like those who brings them to bring them here [Music] go J Lord [Music] [Music] Lord good [Music] microphone [Music] [Applause] G
