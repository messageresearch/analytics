your gift [Music] amen we are in the garden of God so there's a variety of things amen so that we had a pastor here and he comes with something and another Pastor comes with something a [Music] thank God as we stand up for theing of the word and we we will just go back to Genesis 3: 20 and also 14 verse shall we pray Heavenly Father we are so thankful that we are again back and you have never disappointed every time we come together you are also in the midst thank you for your minister that came before us and and we are just about to to follow in the steps just to accomplish what you you

take a citizenship in lashi so I don't know if you will welcome [Music] me yeah brother says the message will reach the jungles of [Music] Africa and one Pastor said to us if you go to America from Africa with a continent of animals mountains and H trees and since natural types the spiritual also blessed us with the spiritual things as we tell to Revelation 3: 20 just to to continue today we shall give it another title H the contact center revelation 3yp for and John chapter 3 14 verse [Music] you may be seated okay Genesis Genesis 3 20 years and Adam called his wife name Eve Eve that's correct all right well it's in line with what we talking about Christ in the [Music] church so Christ also called gave the wife the name [Music] Christ now let's go back to the contact center now we read yesterday of the three Thrones the first one being in heaven the second one in chist the third one in all three together and that we have seen how he came down to the third throne and now we will look into the subject because man is God's Center Point Hallelujah CER Point that's yeah contact center the contact center of God okay okay we read in the Bible how God made the things and brought them to Adam and Adam gave them names so every time God makes a thing he brings it to [Music] men because men is the other part contact part of God man holds the other contract now he is contracted to God that's why when he was coming to Abraham in investigation [Music] of so he said I I shall not hide from Abraham the that [Music] IAM Moses and the other prophets they they saw things own they could see the four quarters God could do nothing without first making a [Music] contact when he is coming to us he has to make a contact with a [Music] man when he was going to destroy the worldall with fls he made a contact with a man so if you read down the Bible you realize that God makes a [Music] contact okay now H let's take to this again and um I'm going to read some few things again now today we read this scripture where it says at that day you shall know that I am in the father and the father and you in me and I in you all right now I will read it here in the book Christ is the mystery of God revealed Page 6 refering to that scripture that day you shall so that's we know today because he says you shall know because if you don't no the Bible say God said my people because of the of knowled because if you don't know you depend on something else whether it's right that is right or wrong because you don't know but the day you know you don't need somebody to inter you what you know the scure that day and he continues to say that is this at day youing to the [Music] Jews to feel and and so forth that day you shall know and the prophet says it is this day amen amen amen and when the Revelation is made [Music] known you will know when the Revelation is made known and he says and then you are see that is the threefold manifestation now the threefold [Music] manifestation he was talking about this he was talking about this I'll do it the way I did it one day so we have a three [Music] manifestation at that day you shall know that I am in the father we are learning French now from South Africa yeah yeah then and again he says and that day you shall know that then you [Music] in right you in me and the third now we are 1 2 3 the third is I in [Music] you okay in the father you you in [Music] me and I in you so it's one thing amen and because the Bible says the all and [Music] all so the prophet calls it a threefold when the Revelation comes forth then I in you that's now what it means in the beginning was the word and the word in God the word was with God so the word was a mind in God then he came like we've seen yesterday that God is a spirit then he came down into the form of the [Music] Lo okay come down anden Hallelujah so so it gives you the third as the [Music] center when he is in you a that is destination all this time God was coming to men even in theard of Eden the Bible says they had his voice walking in the garden because all this time he was coming to his place and I will read again [Music] uh we thank God for the prophet now today we have seen we have heard and we have seen amen now I will read one part again when he say the only way you will know him God the only way you the only way you know him is the only way you'll get [Music] aold because in the book future home [Music] God comes to you in three stages father son Holy Ghost that's how he comes to you now the holy ghost is now the Third and now uh as we read [Music] again in the same book and now I I'm getting to page um 33 okay now look is Christ in you makes him the center of [Music] life makes that CER only when he is in you before that he not he is still coming to the center okay Christ in you made him the center of life of the reation he is amen amen not in heaven not in the church [Music] you then he makes him amen continue Christ life in you makes him the center of the Reel and the prophet Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete Revelation heue Christ in you makes you the complete Revelation maybe somebody will say Amen to know that Christ in you Christ in you makes you amen amen are [Music] youu Revelation means god is there in if you say I got Revelation from God Revelation is that word in flesh Revelation is the word in a man that is ration as we said yesterday [Music] reation Revelation is not just it's not in the book Revelation is in a man living Revelation it makes you a revelation you can't separate it no Christ in you makes you the complete revelation he says this is what God is trying to do to show you amen now H we look at another one again as now he makes you a revelation I will read page 64 again as we are just going for few minutes to continue where we left yesterday now I'm going back to that scripture God and man was one there and God and man is one [Music] here amen you see that that's why standing in the Gap we need to ask our [Music] question because it was God andam and Adam left his post so he [Music] left no okay now all right I will say I will use the same CLE okay we looking at God [Music] [Music] and again when he left the place and God said where are you because he left again so because it was a between and God now when because of sin left Place God came out where are you because he was not in place then it cost God to become the second in order to bring [Music] back again that is what we call [Music] restoration said came with a message standing in the because he is the seventh [Music] angel now the seventh angel messenger is the last [Music] Messenger as we look at John the Baptist as a forun he stood in the G between the old and the New Testament to introduce the Messiah to the Jews the Old Testament and now we are in the New [Music] Testament between the church ages and the the Bible the New Testament amen or Time and [Music] Eternity amen because say God came down the G he took the body of time so he shed his blood to redeem this [Music] G so that he can bring back man to his original [Music] post amen and he did that with brother coming to now in Eden with Adam [Music] wasat God and his son and the Book of Luke chapter 3 I don't know 38 it tell you that Adam was the son of [Music] God Amen okay let me read for you Adam was the son of God so he didn't need a [Music] mediator there was nothing between [Music] and but after the sin then God brought in a mediator until the end of [Music] redemption right so I'm trying to read to you uh Luke 3: 38 coming down of theology now here it says who was the son of Enos verse 38 Luke 3: 38 who was the son of Enos son son son of God soam was the son of not a not a son the Son of God hallelujah then he fall he left the poost amen so that's why God came down the seven steps he established seven steps for us okay now let let's come here again now the prophet says God and man is now one [Music] here then he says he God don't just change it's God in that's his manifestation you can't call it manifestation until it is God that's then when it is manifestation you can't call it a revelation until God is in say it's you can't call it a fulfillment until that way is made flesh that's when it's called fulfillment before that it's not fulfillment because it's not yet in [Music] flesh all now I'll read something here now when you reach the heart amen because we were looking yesterday of how the seventh seal open open the [Music] seals that's why it was Sil because it's the one that open the SE amen now we let's go down this way now I will read from the book the unity of one God in the one church because it also tells me that H when God comes to man he comes [Music] their now we have two things here we have what we call men and we have what we call the [Music] heart separates them he says your soul in your heart another man so we read that yesterday the throne the third Throne is in your soul it has got nothing to do with this this is controlled [Music] by says Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom [Music] of say there is another man and he says that man went to the third heaven and brother tells that that was that Paul the inward part of Paul went to the [Music] third this one is natural he has only five senses that's why I can say to you I live in South Africa I live in South Africa my house is there but will you believe me if I say to you I can see my house right while standing here you don't believe and if if you don't have a vision of your house afraid you are going to get lost when you leave because your house is programmed in you am am now am you must take me to your house because it's not programmed in me if it's my first time to go to your house I need somebody to me there noted in [Music] me somebody can go to your house because programmed in him that's how we are going to heaven you are going to go something that ised in you you know when Jesus was coming to John the Bible says John saw Jesus comingto him because that thing was programmed [Music] she said to Jesus I believe you are a [Music] prophet and she to tell the people J
