TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] for you to see what is in the first you should be standing on the mountain on the seventh you've got to see it when you are upon the mountain you can start from beneath the mountain coming up amen amen because you don't start there you start here when you are here let me show you something in the Bible just read Revelation chapter [Music] 21y apyp one of the seven angels which had the seven VES full of the seven last plages and talk with me saying come hither I'll show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and carry on and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and show me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God amen amen he said come up here yeah because you must be somewhere the prophet speaks of the three Maj they have seen his in the east from the position where they were standing then he continues to say you should be in the the right the Bible says Abraham woke up in the morning and went to the place where he stood before the Lord when he were when he approached the place he saw Sodom burning for him to see Sodom B he had to return to that place where he stood before the Lord because from that place he could see down to Sodom and he knew that morning to see it he has to go abroad you've got to move you some things you can't see in the denominations you can't see them to move higher you've got to find the right spot amen amen when you can view and review amen you've got to be in the right place now elishah knew he started just as a follower passing through some ages Church ages it was a journey he would come to Ephesus Church he had not yet come he followed all the churches until to Jordan which means amen amen then he followed until he crossed over now it was two types of Believers the ones on this side of Jordan and the one the other side of Jordan for he followed that Spirit he needed to be baptized with the spirit where a formal church member would just say amen God send us Elijah the prophet and that's far he can go Elijah has sent us Elijah the prophet God has sent us Elijah the prophet but not Elijah elishah was not a stationary [Music] believer every time moving to perfection he knew that something must happen to him and that thing is with Elijah that's why he cried out where is the god of Elijah and we need a people today who will cry out and say where is the god of brother not the people not the people only know how to code amen but the people who want to grasp life and brother says El wanted to be like Elijah because Elijah has set a standard now he knew that for me to say I'm in the message I must reach that standard you know God will always put up a standard that's why Mal 3 Mal 4 10 not that God has said everything below that is below the standard the seven SE all right Elijah followed and followed and followed amen amen and he couldn't change churches because he he has seen it in Elijah he couldn't join up with any other [Music] Organization no there was a pool coming from Elijah so he just followed until on the other side and once on the other side was the only Soul member that was the size of the church on the other side you see the size of the church on the other side of the seven Church ages it is in the minority the church on the other side [Music] one time Jesus had a big crowd and he blessed bread and fed thousands a big Crow crowd there believing that he's the prophet of God the Bible says they even wanted to make him a king a king that could multiply bread and fish amen amen they thought if we can make this man our King there won't be any hunger it will be a like a Communist Party amen amen every morning we just go with a boy with a fish and say Lord this is what do we have then multipli MP amen amen even the fishermen will stop bothering the doing fishing because then after that he moved on to the other side he took a ship to the other side the Bible says that big crowd they were back the next morning no one was late amen amen came with their families that God has sent us a prophet amen amen you can say bye-bye to hunger okay when they AR at the very same spot yesterday's spot amen you know the word of God keeps on moving on all right yesterday's spot they came there the Bible says he was not there so they look for for him even they didn't mind to pay for CR to the other side actually they they wanted to bring him back they would didn't allow him to be a prophet in another place they wanted when they arrive from the other side they realized that he has changed the message amen amen he has changed the message amen amen and said to them except you drink you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you they walked away they walked away from him and the Bible says they never never again followed [Music] him because it went now into another pH or or a the next stage now the people don't want the next stage they want to remain in yesterday stage amen all right now it says here look at it uh the bride of Christ uh by the holy ghost baptized into the body now first let's look this is this body before we just close here why is the body of Christ I sometimes he the people talking about the founders the founders but the founders that I know they are in the Bible it's when Philip said to Nathaniel we have found him he didn't said we have started a church he says we have found not we have found his books we have found his quotations no it was beyond that because Moses did write of him prophets prophesied of him now he was no longer a scripture or prophecy and they said we have found him amen amen it's not a scripture now it's not a prophecy it's a fulfillment they spoke about him but now he is here let me read to you something here uh the bride of Christ the church only came into view once you know at Pentecost it came once the church but the bride came in twice okay you know as we are in the second round not the first the first that's at Pentecost okay now here we go but the the Bride come in twice uh the seed fell in the ground at nasia Rome that was the original seed and she's come through the process of this denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days for the Lord said I will restore the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time before the n and all others never appeared no more they come once and they are gone they went out never to come back again to come back doesn't mean to come back to church we are talking of the supernatural you know there was war in heaven and the Bible says like it says there was a woman Revelation 12 let me cut it short a bit it says the Dragon that stood before the woman she drew a third part of he of the stars of Heaven down and cast them down to earth now uh verse seven there was war in heaven Satan and his angels fought and Michael and his angels so Satan Was Defeated did you know that although some people worship Him He Was Defeated he is now only armed with lies he is equipped with lies he has lost the key he has lost the power amen amen now somebody says he has power yes to his Believers to us he has no power he's a fallen angel Isaiah saw him limping when he hit the ground and even to today he is on a wheelchair from that day from that day he was confirmed to confined to a wheelchair [Music] but there's some people who go and worship [Music] him okay now the Bible says they were cast out Down cast down and their place was no longer found in heaven now if a man is cornered in a corner and there's no more place for him he will start tricks and lies and you know if you worship Satan you worship a street kid he has no home no place when God separated water from water you know Satan he went with the flats that went to one side and establish himself under the sea I know you don't believe it in the end time it says the Beast shall come out of [Music] there I'll read to you the things that are in the sea okay amen that's why Revelation chapter 21 speaks of new Heaven and Earth without the sea amen because the sea became The Hiding [Music] Place amen amen so God is going to get rid of the SE in the new Heaven and Earth God bless you let me finish this all others now we are talking about the Holy Spirit bride of Christ a building fly joined together that is the spirit of God Ephesian Church the spirit of God up the spirit of God uhhuh now because it's a spirit of God you can join it you are baptized into it because the material is Spirit now you are baptized into it by the spirit amen amen all right all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega amen you see his body he is Alpha and Omega his body is Alpha and Omega he cannot marry any any other thing amen amen if he is the word B says the bride should be the word he can't marry a cre or Dogma he has to marry his own wife and his own wife should come from him Adam did not go around the PS and churches looking for a woman already she was in him now the Lord Jesus doesn't run short of the church no because it was in [Music] him all right so now he only came to reveal her because when he is revealed the whole body is revealed he came to reveal the woman in him the wife amen amen not just a woman just but the wife the Queen the queen okay I've seen some people calling themselves Queen queens of the underworld queens of the queens of the ocean with some plastic crowns I'm sorry you are going to lose that Crown there's only one Queen to the crown that is M Jesus any que is BAS let's [Music] read here it says for she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a a masterpiece amen amen now we are thankful for that but let us get the right thing the last thing here as the church is the spirit of God so the body should be the spirit of God amen amen can I read it to you all right I will find it here in the word brother bam says uh the church is the is the individuals yeah the Bible says so it is the individuals baptized with the Holy Ghost they make the bride H forgive me while I'm trying to read here okay now as in the individuals these VES and things you know seven VES as Peter has put it to you you have seven virtues because he says the man who lth this seven cannot see a far off amen amen so you you need seven Vil that builds you because because God said be ye therefore perfect the Lord Jesus be therefore as your father in Heaven is okay that's the standard if God is perfect he says be ye therefore perfect now for God to come into us it will only be through the spirit as he said to them the spirit dwells with you it was not in them he dwelt with them and he said then it shall be in you I don't know maybe right now you are dwelling with the spirit but it should be in you amen for I will read you something here while I'm I'm watching my RO watching when God made things he was working on a pattern because what he wanted to achieve was a man in his own image he couldn't have a man here on Earth who is [Music] lesser that's why today you are here to hear the word of God do you see God there uhhuh so he made man to be his bookes man he made man as a vessel to indwell now if you are predestinated you will look for the men God said let us make men in our image and the people working here on Earth they cannot stop I can't worship until I find that man not from the bible school but from God amen amen and the thing that will put me together with my own kind is the Holy Ghost be ye therefore holy you are baptized into the body lastly there's something here when God was working on a pattern upon the earth a Perfection this is your Masterpiece and that was a man finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection when God was creating that was a man then he could see in that man that it looked like him in another book he says when he approached that man he stopped because coming down he looked at the tree he looked at the animals he went on he could create the tree and carry on but when he after he created the man then he stopped there because when he looked at that man it looked like him if you can walk on the street and Sunday come against somebody who looks like you that's why we couldn't stop anywhere until the seals were open is then we said this is indeed him he is the seals that were revealed he saw in that man that it looked like him when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted he wanted amen In His Image this is your your your your your your last thing here when he says amen amen H in the individual this VES which is seven VES when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together meaning that if you have some vges you need the Holy Ghost to cement it together it's so vital there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen amen it is attracted by the VES that are in you amen when Peter found those men with vges natural vges as the um Prophet puts it then he laid hands upon them because Peter has seen that the ground was ready for the Holy Ghost he didn't pray just for anybody but he prayed for those in whom he could see that the ground was ready for the Holy Ghost that's why he couldn't go to hospital and pray lay hands of the people and going on the street saying come come receive the Holy Ghost even the Lord Jesus he couldn't just pour out the Holy Ghost but he he said go and wait to that group the people he has made activated in order for to be prepared for the Holy Ghost because the plant the the seed is planted first and the watering comes after as we have seen it you plant the seed then you water the seed but it says the Capstone is the holy spirit there is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it is so short today because people they don't they cannot differentiate between a sensation and the and he the Holy Ghost amen amen if he can roll three times he say yesterday I have received the Holy Ghost how brother I have rolled I I work with with a certain young man he said to me hey isra is yesterday his father-in-law is a pastor inor yesterday I received the Holy Ghost now let me tell you he was saying this to me a cigarette in his hand yesterday I I received the Holy Ghost father-in-law prayed for me so I wondered said I saw sure Billy he said sure sure I I spoke in Tong amen amen so I didn't know didn't understand whether it's a holy cigarette or what so that's why the spirit comes and seal these things in you that is the Holy Ghost that's why he said go and wait for the comfor when he has come he will guide you amen elishah knew he must receive the spirit otherwise he would receive with history God has sent us a prophet hallelujah hallelujah thank God for the prophet but yet motionless because the spirit keeps you God bless you as I hand over to our pastor [Applause] amen am thank you Lord God bless you amen God bless you Pastor [Music] [Music] he m
