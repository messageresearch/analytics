[20:24] the son of Israel
[20:26] right
[20:31] naughty Mama we are eating the American
[20:34] the child
[20:36] um

[23:04] now the Seed of Abraham is Christ or
[23:08] Christ
[23:11] if they start
[23:12] um to manifest
[23:18] they should reflect Christ
[23:21] The Seed of Abraham that's why God came
[23:26] to the house of abrahamas
[23:30] to bring forth a child
[23:33] when they were stricken
