[27:32] will I didn't fail Ure
[27:35] no one can persuade them differently
[27:42] [Music]
[27:47] or they keep still
[27:50] meaning even the ministry they have
[27:55] what the Lord says
[28:25] you may take your seats
[28:29] all right
[28:35] we will continue there
[28:39] with that
[28:43] paper
[28:45] the third through yeah this is the third
[28:48] Throne Ministry
[28:53] okay
[28:56] actually how about you it's not
[29:00] preaching to the people who knows
[29:07] last we were looking at something here
[29:15] I will not be
[29:17] preaching to the people
[29:22] because we are looking at the
[29:24] the seals are being opened
[29:29] and
[29:32] everything is
[29:34] in his place amen
[29:41] I'm going to start
[29:44] with this
[29:47] foreign
[30:03] I've been reading it for
[30:06] you know for ages
[30:11] I just wonder if it has found a place
[30:16] in somebody else
[30:18] um
[30:21] now the prophet
[30:23] uh
[30:25] puts this to us and
[30:31] about I'm still just putting things
[30:34] together and
[30:39] they wait Linda
[30:42] in the bread yeah
[30:47] now you realize
[30:50] it seems like we've been bringing things
[30:53] in pieces
[30:57] touch there and leave
[31:02] amen amen while we were last time we
[31:06] were looking at the
[31:09] evidence
[31:18] so the first one I think
[31:22] you have noticed you have seen these
[31:24] things
[31:27] we were looking at Abraham
[31:30] when he
[31:33] looked from the place
[31:37] he saw Sodom burning ah bonuses
[31:47] and then we came to build a brand name
[31:53] at the the seventh sign
[31:58] he also saw a similar things
[32:02] and
[32:09] then as I said last time
[32:13] I was also trying to
[32:16] get into
[32:18] a tribulation tribulation
[32:23] tribulation but I couldn't because
[32:29] we are waiting for
[32:32] a takeoff here
[32:37] I teaching trying to teach
[32:45] well you you'll see where we are
[32:49] and uh
[32:51] so we can't get into some other things
[33:02] it's the time of the tribulation
[33:07] we are just waiting
[33:11] but it's like that so
[33:15] but that's why I read this is
[33:29] will be looking at that
[33:32] yes said
[33:34] through the ministry
[33:36] is there now
[33:38] not preaching to the people
[33:41] no yeah it's over but it is just in
[33:46] their heart you know my fella mobile
[33:48] amen
[33:50] of those that are to be raptured
[33:57] usually
[34:00] I will read some I've got something here
[34:03] okay
[34:06] I'm going to remind you of something
[34:10] because according to
[34:12] this church ages
[34:17] Christ is outside
[34:21] if you read everyone that is standing in
[34:27] because the prophet says
[34:30] what happened
[34:32] he is not in he is not in the church
[34:37] he's outside okay but knocking at
[34:41] individuals
[34:44] we are individuals
[34:50] and you don't know who's who here but we
[34:54] are individuals
[34:58] there's some people that are living
[35:02] they will be taken up in the river
[35:09] [Applause]
[35:10] party
[35:22] did you know that
[35:24] they know but it's already potentially
[35:28] it is
[35:35] I wonder if you you've known it yeah
[35:41] [Applause]
[35:45] that's why we you will realize
[35:48] we are not free last week
[35:55] is
[36:01] somebody yeah
[36:07] and even some I don't know who's this
[36:11] young man
[36:13] who brought their cell phones
[36:18] gave them to brother
[36:21] to barbella
[36:25] yeah
[36:29] amen amen and then
[36:33] she's not the only person with their
[36:36] cell phones
[36:39] there's some people here with cell
[36:41] phones
[36:43] and they've got things
[36:54] right they are not ready
[36:58] for the Rapture anything I'm talking
[37:01] about the bride of Christ
[37:05] the bride of Christ the people who are
[37:08] ready
[37:11] a mysterious part of it is
[37:28] is that
[37:30] potential
[37:32] the Rapture is in them
[37:37] I'm sorry I'm talking to the people
[37:40] who
[37:42] uh
[37:43] who are ready
[37:45] to be taken up
[37:48] already in them
[37:53] okay amen
[37:56] now we will reach you things
[38:00] and I won't prolonged things
[38:04] and now
[38:07] another thing maybe you'll wonder at
[38:11] this
[38:13] seems that we are taking things in
[38:15] pieces
[38:19] like I had
[38:21] another page last characters
[38:26] and that we
[38:31] it speaks of also the seventh
[38:38] yeah this one yes
[38:42] speaks of the men of sin
[38:46] all right hey
[38:49] he says
[38:52] hey I love
[38:53] I I love the
[38:56] the man of God
[39:01] does this mean of sins
[39:03] that is
[39:05] second Thessalonians
[39:08] chapter four I think
[39:14] chapter 2 chapter 2 it speaks of this
[39:17] man of sinbi
[39:20] who will be revealed in his time
[39:26] at the breaking of that scene
[39:33] okay amen and I want to
[39:37] foreign
[39:52] opened to us
[39:57] now if I ask you
[40:00] what is open to us
[40:13] you see
[40:15] but
[40:17] I will reach and now you know
[40:22] what withholded that he might be
[40:26] revealed in his time
[40:35] because that time is already arrived
[40:42] for the men of sin to be revealed
[40:48] but it says in his
[40:52] Monaco in his time
[40:55] at the breaking
[40:58] of that
[41:03] so you know the breaking of that scene
[41:08] I
[41:09] read
[41:13] out of the book here
[41:16] let me read you something yeah
[41:19] where where
[41:20] we are more brilliant okay amen
[41:26] um
[41:30] like last week
[41:31] it's not a
[41:34] a thing of calling the people and say I
[41:37] said
[41:38] Surrender Your
[41:43] cell phone surrendered
[41:47] it's already
[41:49] in their heart
[41:54] amen
[41:56] he who's keeping his he's keeping it in
[41:59] his house
[42:12] you will listen to something
[42:14] the first word was that uh
[42:31] and so
[42:33] in his time
[42:35] let me look in his time
[42:40] at the breaking
[42:43] of that
[42:46] Layla
[42:48] now that we have six seal here
[42:52] and uh
[42:57] you know why
[42:58] brother Larry memes here say yes

[43:14] and the full operations
[43:20] that means you are caught up
[43:26] yeah
[43:28] not not prayer life
[43:32] then it says
[43:39] the opening of the servants
[43:45] yeah of which
[43:47] the people are still saying
[43:50] it is
[43:53] but it says to the public
[43:59] because if we were to go back yeah
[44:08] now the threefold mystery yes
[44:13] if you are part of that
[44:18] if it it is opened
