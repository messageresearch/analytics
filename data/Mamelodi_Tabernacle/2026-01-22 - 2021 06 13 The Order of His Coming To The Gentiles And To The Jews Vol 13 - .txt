Remember that song is for the past. So let's wait for him to come. Amen. H a pastor read an invitation to DRC. I believe it was last week. Pastor Salm says if there's anyone that is going to accompany the pastor is welcome but then you need to send me the names so that they can prepare the invitation specifically tailored accordingly. Hallelujah. Amen. Now just to inform you uh in DRC before you travel to DRC you need to take a COVID test here in South Africa and on arrival in DRC you are going to pay $50 for the COVID test. So you do it here in South Africa. You do it on arrival and also there's charges for airport tax about $100 that you need to pay. So if you're going to accompany the pastor, you need to know that you need to have about $200. $100 is for airport tax. $50 is for COVID test in entering DRC. Another $50 for COVID test to exit DRC. And they also need a yellow card. May the Lord richly bless you. Amen. Amen. H another song as we wait for the pastor. God bless you. Uh Maybe just one stanza before the pastor comes in and on arrival we will sing a special song for the past. God bless you. God is Tless. to you. over. But in the days of the voice of the second when he begins to sound strings of the should be finished as he has declared to his serants and prophets. And he shall turn the heart of the children to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers. Lest I come. Bless thy God and smile the earth with the in the days of the voice of the when He shout to sound the street of God should be finished as he has declared to the heavens the prophet and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Lest I come. Lest I come and smile the earth with a kiss. Welcome. Welcome. Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; holy ghost we will come with power. Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; holy ghost we will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like we are in heaven? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know just I I think it has been three weeks now thinking of visiting the the the singers here to introduce to them this song behold I'll send you Elijah so that for them to arrange it But God had me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the days, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I'm living in the days &gt;&gt; of that manifested voice of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's why when we sing these songs to me, it's not just a song. &gt;&gt; It's a manifestation of &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Carry on doing that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now our welcome welcome has changed. &gt;&gt; Welcome. &gt;&gt; It has taken another form now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, we are here to worship God. &gt;&gt; Your hatred won't work. All those who are here are here to worship. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "Forgive one another and worship God. If you want to go there &gt;&gt; today at the end of the service, You stand right here. &gt;&gt; And repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Uh for being the Let me read you some things before I sit down. There is something here. I will tell you why we worship in the way we worship. &gt;&gt; Shall I read it to you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You forgive me. Sometimes I will pick up a book and try to read and because of my uh my my mind fast. My mind is so fast. Sometimes I try to read something and I will miss it. &gt;&gt; And yet it is in the book. Amen. But still I will miss it &gt;&gt; because of my mind running too fast. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But be just before we sit down. &gt;&gt; Uh I will read you something here. &gt;&gt; Um the prophet speaks here. He says, &gt;&gt; "The reason I don't believe this is something we missed last time." &gt;&gt; You could see I was running through the book trying to read this same thing I'm reading to you right now because I owe you. I'm I'm reading it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason that is smile smiling church age page 210. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I don't believe that there is an eternal hell. There cannot be an eternal hell. Cuz if there ever was an eternal hell, then there always was an eternal hell. Because there is only one form of eternal life and that's what we all striving for. Amen. That's why I'm not striving uh for like a thing of striving for the people to love me or to walk with me. I'm striving for eternal life. Amen. Amen. And uh there's only one form of eternal life. That's what we all are striving for because it's either eternal life or a hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, how can I be waiting for things that I know they will come to the end? They will pass away. Okay, think deep. &gt;&gt; Can you work for something that you know exactly that it's not eternal and it it it will pass away. Even the Bible says heaven and earth shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. And John say I saw new heaven and a new earth. Therefore because the former one has passed away. Now we are living here in the former one which shall pass away. When you if even if you can say to me, I give you 10 billion randsion, &gt;&gt; but they shall pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think I will enjoy them? &gt;&gt; Because I'm looking at the end of of that 10 billion. If you are looking at a man, you are actually looking at the body of a man. You are actually looking at the end because this body shall rot in the grave. You are just looking at the end of that person. He can be rich and boast and be whatever but you are looking at the end of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I can't embrace the things of this world. Because every time I pick up this thing, I'm picking up the thing at its last breath. Okay. Amen. And but there's the wonder of it all. While I'm saying this, somebody still holding to something that is slipping out of his hand because that thing shall pass away and the world shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Demons shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Riches shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Your mind shall pass away. &gt;&gt; That's why I can't rely on my mind because I'm looking at these things. I'm looking at the things that are passing away. Heaven and earth shall pass away. and says, &gt;&gt; "Behold, &gt;&gt; I make all things new, the book of Revelation." Okay, but I was saying this, this is a thing that last I was trying to read to you and it just slipped off my mind. Um, it says &gt;&gt; now there's no burning hell. &gt;&gt; You can't have eternal hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't rejoice and say the prophet says don't go there. You've seen terrible things, but don't go to hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have seen terrible and terrible things, &gt;&gt; but then don't go to the tribulation period. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he says hell can be there even for millions of years or so forth, but it will eventually pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it can be around for eternal eternity. Now let me finish. Hell was created. &gt;&gt; That's why it has no eternal life. And if it's created, it is in eternal. Anything that's eternal never was created. I I believe somebody's listening. Amen. Then one can stand up and say I was created by God. Anything that's eternal never was created. That's why my soul was not created. Amen. &gt;&gt; It always was. It's eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says hell was created for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; Hell was created. It is in eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we can read on and on and on and on. &gt;&gt; But that's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are going to read the scripture of today and I believe God will be with us and for for this moment Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before we ask one of our brothers to or my son is here to just for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to as we bow our heads in him there is no failure. In him there is no ine. There is no faith. &gt;&gt; In him there is no favor. There is no faith. There is no there is no so. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Blessed and gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; once again this morning, we thank you for this opportunity you've given us together in your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Standing upon the promises of your word that if we gather in this name, you will be in our midst. &gt;&gt; And oh father, you are our special guest this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one we want to welcome the most this morning, oh God. &gt;&gt; That you come here, Father, take your position. &gt;&gt; And we know where your position is, heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because heavenly father, when you come, you don't just hang in the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; Lord.

Oh, may that heavenly channel be opened to us all once again this morning. &gt;&gt; Even those, Father, that are joining us through the the streaming service. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Father, may we all be consecrated this morning &gt;&gt; to receive your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the reading of your word. Bless the service, Father, as we commit and yield everything to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our King. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hey. &gt;&gt; Yes.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When this name is called &gt;&gt; Underworld, &gt;&gt; underworld &gt;&gt; has to bow. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know why you don't love this songs. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care who has a I'm not counting on the a writer of the song. You know brother one time I I sang a song. What is that song again? Tell me. Remind me. who are shall Holy corn. Who's shall amen Jesus is always here. Amen. Now, one said it's song. &gt;&gt; I said no. It doesn't say it says Jesus is always present. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know the composers of all these songs. We only know the song. Let's turn our Bibles to our Bibles. Let us just read today. Let me read two books. Revelation chapter 12 verse 4. 12:4. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll start with that one and we'll turn to we are still just around the throne room. Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't want to start because it will be a a concert. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Around the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. dance around. &gt;&gt; So that's why I want to read about the song and after this we are still going uh to look at some things because for us to arrive at the throne is after overcoming. Then we'll take you back to show how we arrived where we are because we are beyond the seven church ages. Verse 20 says chapter 20 verse4 &gt;&gt; and I saw thrones. Now it's not now this time is not throne but thrones. And they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them. I and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads for in their hand or in their hands. and they lived and reign with Christ a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you identify them? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord said, "You shall sit on how many thrones?" Oh, we were reading yesterday, brother harvest. You read it yesterday. Amen. read it. &gt;&gt; The church don't know about those thrones. &gt;&gt; Okay. Otherwise, 12 thrones. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are reading it last night, I think. &gt;&gt; Have you forgotten? &gt;&gt; Yes. 27 &gt;&gt; chapter &gt;&gt; 19th chapter &gt;&gt; Matthews &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; then teacher and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed me what shall we have therefore and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that he which shall follow me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory. He also shall sit upon 12 tribes of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will come to that throne. The Jewish. &gt;&gt; The Jews will be judged by the Jews. The Gentiles shall be judged by the Gentiles. Amen. Amen. The Jews shall be judged by the Jews. The Gentiles shall be judged by the Gentiles. It is in your Bible. But let's follow these things because it is the end of the whole thing. Okay. Amen. Now we have here again. Now this is for the Gentiles. Verse 11. Verse 11. &gt;&gt; And I saw a great white throne. Now, not thrones. &gt;&gt; Because for the Jews, it says on on how many thrones? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; And he shall judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because even the gates there 12 12. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that is Jewish because the prophet says the roots &gt;&gt; is Jewish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Bible Ephesians says &gt;&gt; for for we are built upon &gt;&gt; the foundation &gt;&gt; the foundation of the &gt;&gt; prophets &gt;&gt; and apostles. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why if you go to the new Jerusalem, you'll realize Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Have you prophesied that I'm getting I'm bending here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, this is not part of preaching. But if the month is June or July, it doesn't mean that even if the sun is out and burning, but because it's winter, you should switch on the game &gt;&gt; because some go to sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't sleep, my friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Around the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from &gt;&gt; Now you can see the difference. &gt;&gt; You see the difference because that one is thrones 12. &gt;&gt; This one is throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I want us to you you may take your seat. Now I want to go back again a bit uh something uh so wonderful here and I want us to read it. I don't know if these things were packed together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now I've got to look around. I don't know how the brother packed them here. And then okay, hold on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm still It is the brother who packed these things for me last night, &gt;&gt; but it seems as if not packed away. I would have loved them to be packed &gt;&gt; otherwise. Amen. We have read the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my look at this. Uh and the brother is not here. But let me not give in or give up. &gt;&gt; Let us I will start here again. Now this part that we are going to read uh all the things scriptures that are being read here they are it's an they are indicating to us that we are on our way back home. We're not talking about we are not talking about the past here. We are talking about the things that are coming. Why? Because they are coming immediately. Uh we are already in &gt;&gt; those that are in are going shall be taken in the rapture. They are already in that zone. &gt;&gt; And I told a brother &gt;&gt; that you see this lockdown has &gt;&gt; shown us a a church goer and a predestinated son or daughter of God. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until some people said mocking mockingly, they said, "Oh, these days, you know, go to fellowship in the Bible said they shall come &gt;&gt; and they shall mock us." &gt;&gt; All right. They mocked the Lord Jesus Christ even when he was on the cross. They continued to mock him. Now we are who who are we? If they mocked your masterly they will mock you. If you they mock your master and said you you are trying to be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are they not going to do the same thing to us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not offended if you say to me, brother, you are trying to be God. Why? God came and became us. Amen. And it is God who said, "Let us make men in our image, now a person who was made in the image of God has that desire always to be like him because he was made in his." &gt;&gt; What is the bride of Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay sister, worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are made in the image of God, &gt;&gt; there is a desire in you to be like him. Amen. Amen. And the prophet came the seventh angel messenger. You read blasphemous names. He says, "The sons of God will be God's." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How that's how it is with God. Then again in your book adoption, then he says, &gt;&gt; "You you know the scripture I mean the quotation that we read it time and again it's killing one and giving life to one because if I say to you brother uh you are an amasha god if you are you say amen that's what you are amen Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's leave it there. That's why &gt;&gt; it's Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen to the word of God because this is who you are. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel said, &gt;&gt; "Oh, Jacob, but that's what you are. But Israel &gt;&gt; is who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there's difference be between what you are and who you are. Amen. You are the word of God. That's who you are. Amen. Do you know that? Now let's take this. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, This thing is wonderful. &gt;&gt; You know these days I love this book. Future home of the future of what is it? Future home. &gt;&gt; Where is it brother? &gt;&gt; You know sometimes when I do things I peg them them myself because I pick him for somebody next time he finds that brother. We were in Switzerland then he said look at that wife now. one shoe. This I find one shoe here. It's not pale &gt;&gt; and that the socks also mixed up here. I I I said brother you pack your things for yourself otherwise you'll find because she knows to pack her things but not yours brothers I'm not messing things up for you that you know you sometimes ask mama please do it for I I pull my trolley and pack things for myself so that when I arrive in Congo or Switzerland, &gt;&gt; I won't blame somebody. &gt;&gt; It's not a good thing. Do it yourself. You know, I thought we The Bible says she is your help. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. In in which way &gt;&gt; in taking for you? &gt;&gt; What I today? Let's leave it today. &gt;&gt; We'll bring it. Now listen. Last week we were on something very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of God &gt;&gt; is with men. You know, you must watch these things. When brother Brennham was preaching there and he said, "I went back to the tabernacle." &gt;&gt; Was it to the tabernacle? &gt;&gt; Amen. I came back to the earth &gt;&gt; to reveal &gt;&gt; these things. &gt;&gt; And you remember &gt;&gt; it's not tabernacle &gt;&gt; but the the tabernacle he went back to reveal the things to was the body. Amen. It is the bride of Christ because when he came back from meeting the angels message, he came to the bride. Amen. Amen. Not &gt;&gt; to the bride of Christ. That's why sometimes the people would rush to Brenham. and saying, "Brother Brennham said, I came back to reveal them." Not knowing that to reveal them to the tabernacle, the bride of Christ. That's why this morning we are enjoying these things. We are the tabernacle. Amen. and the whole parts of this tabernacle everywhere you go to California, you go to Zambia, you go to Tanzania, you go to Malawi, they all in one voice. Ah, amen. That is the tabernacle of God. entire tabernacle of God. It's it's Malawi, South Africa. Hallelujah. As I'm preaching here, I'm greeting also Tanzania. &gt;&gt; I'm greeting Malawi. &gt;&gt; I'm greeting California. &gt;&gt; That's the tabernacle of God. Now, let's look at it a bit. All right. Um uh um if I were preaching to mommy I it would be different. &gt;&gt; But if I'm preaching to the board the entire body of God you'll hear that &gt;&gt; it will be different &gt;&gt; from just taking upon mood. maybe uh there it's two people you never know. Now if you intend to preaching to mommy Lord you maybe you are preaching to two people or one or three. Now the message is not the mood message is the message to the entire body of God.

But God bless you for for coming with your books, notebooks. It shows that you are so much concerned with the word of God. You want to put it in your heart and also in your booklets. Unless a person who comes without a Bible. Have you ever a soldier going to war, without a gun? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like this going to war and and the enemy is coming with the guns and what what what do you call that? the machine guns and the bombs and &gt;&gt; this thing of Russia.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; maybe next week we'll say the pastor is shouting at us saying we must bring our Bibles. &gt;&gt; That still won't work. &gt;&gt; It should not be the pastor push you to carry your Bible. It should be your heart, your soul, not if it is the pastor, then you'll just come and put it in front of you. It says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth that's chapter 21 He is in his body. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the tabernacle of God is with men. That means Jesus is in a body working with men. That is what is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we come and meet him here in the tabernacle spiritually. Amen. To worship and honor him. But we are going to meet him in his body. And when we shall let us go to heaven. The heaven that we are going to is immov. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; And is is short coming &gt;&gt; and every breath every second. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To meet like a clock because he is coming very very soon. Amen. If you are a child of God, if you are predestinated, you can even hear within yourself that he is coming very soon. So he is even so close to us in his body. Now look at the difference. Today he is with us and we are a body. He is spiritually with us. But that day that is coming, he will be with us. Amen. Amen. He will be in a body. While I'm in a body, the body that is to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why they sing. It's going to be wonderful. It's going to be wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. In heaven. And &gt;&gt; when we meet and the holy saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not I'm talking about this. &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice. out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me, &gt;&gt; and he will dwell with &gt;&gt; with them." Amen. &gt;&gt; Even now we say that he is walking with us. &gt;&gt; This is spiritually. But now when he the tabernacle God will will be with us and he will dwell &gt;&gt; with with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there's difference between he will dwell in us and he will dwell with us. Right now he is in us. as he said that day you shall know that I am in you but from being in us then it says now he will dwell with us he also being in a body and we right now he's not in a body he is in a body his wife but he will come when he is in his individual body and we also in the bodies. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking at him, his face. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you'll recognize him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why now we are striving &gt;&gt; not to be known of men, not to get millions, but to see him. Amen. That &gt;&gt; that's in our heart because if you are predestinated, you were born to meet him. You are born to see him. You are born to love him. You are born to serve him because you are predestinated to see him, to love him. Amen. Amen. To be indwelled by him. He says, "Yes, Jesus." Amen. Dwell in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's blessed. Amen. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people and God himself, not the Holy Ghost now, God himself." &gt;&gt; Amen. When we shall see him, look at him and God himself shall be with them and be with their God. The Bible here is trying to emphasize on these things that that's when God and men shall meet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's really &gt;&gt; putting that in us &gt;&gt; to our comfort. &gt;&gt; Verse four. &gt;&gt; Verse four. &gt;&gt; And God shall wipe away their tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, bye-bye death, neither sorrow nor crying. Never shall there be any more pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the You can say to the chemist, bye-bye. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to the pharmacy. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to hospital. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to ambulance. &gt;&gt; Ambulance. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the land of ambulances. &gt;&gt; That's not the land of pain. No sorrow. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we are going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it says they look back to the world they used to be. Amen. They have seen a better country. Can you keep the old one if you have seen the new one? Amen. You buy new shoes and you do away with the old ones. You receive Jesus. You do away with the religions of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; The old stuff. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put on the new man. He says, Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put off the old man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he says &gt;&gt; the old water shall pass away. &gt;&gt; He will put it off. Amen. And shall bring forth the new one. for the new people, for the new bodies, for the new mind, for the new souls. &gt;&gt; For brother Brennham says &gt;&gt; speaks of the new soul. &gt;&gt; Now this new soul is the word of God to you. &gt;&gt; It's new soul. the old things have passed away. He told me one time saying, "If you haven't married a good wife, did you hear the prophet say or if you haven't found a good one, you'll find one?" Because he says, "I make all things new. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Comfort in somebody. If I want to comfort somebody who comes and say, "Hey, my wife, brother, she's like problem, you know, I can't even sleep." I said, "Don't worry, brother. Follow the prophet." He says if you you haven't got a good one, &gt;&gt; you will you are still going to get a good one. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say drop this one. Leave it like that. &gt;&gt; I told a brother what what must I do now? You know, even every time I knock off my duty, thinking of going back to that woman, brother, &gt;&gt; don't you worry, go to your house. Amen. Amen. Remain with your family. He said, "What must I do?" I said, "What you should do? is to live &gt;&gt; and let live leave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is greater than your wife to your life, your life. If you love even your mother more than your him, &gt;&gt; what did he say? He comes first. &gt;&gt; He's the first in everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know today, every time a child maybe comes to age, we will take the Bible and put it there and sit down and say, "Mama, come let us plan for the future of this child. And the Bible says you never say tomorrow I will do this and that is God. &gt;&gt; But naturally today the people will say let us plan for the future of this child. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; One says I want her to be this the other want to be that. But I will always say I want her or him to be a Christian. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this and that and that you will fail. &gt;&gt; But in Christ come a &gt;&gt; he will survive. He will still be in the hands of the Almighty. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put yourself your your child &gt;&gt; in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not inst. What do you say? What is that? Astra &gt;&gt; astral projection. &gt;&gt; This children make they don't know it when I'm asking brotherh. &gt;&gt; Let me find somebody. You call it astral &gt;&gt; projection. &gt;&gt; What is this where they are afraid of saying because they in there? Mhm. putting your child in there, your marriage in there. &gt;&gt; Only if you knew, &gt;&gt; you would be listening. &gt;&gt; I should you should put your marriage in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there can be a show &gt;&gt; and they put Christ here, they put Instagram here, &gt;&gt; name them, Facebook and say, "All right, all right." &gt;&gt; The married people, &gt;&gt; where would you love to put your marriage? &gt;&gt; Surely I will say in Jesus. Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; The name I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got the whole world in his hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; They took the rod of Aaron, put it in the holiest and it blossomed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Not because he watered it, he done this, but because it was in the holiest, you can put anything in the holiest, it will bloom. Put your child in the holiest, she will blossom. Amen. Amen. Put her in the Instagram, she will die. Amen. Because Satan, &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; knows where to pluck a tree called in Instagram. What what name them Instagram, Facebook almost the whole world is in whether they are in the message or they are in there. Don't put me there please. I belong to Jesus. If you want to bless me, put me in Christ because I know there &gt;&gt; I shall bloom. Amen spiritually &gt;&gt; for my attire natural attire. &gt;&gt; I don't go to Instagram &gt;&gt; or to whatever &gt;&gt; to see I just go to shop &gt;&gt; to wear because I can't walk naked. They had problems of standing before a mirror as you've got today. We've got the problems standing before the mirror because in my in our mind we want the people to see us not God. Have you seen that before the mirror doing this? How do I appear? How shall I appear before the people? I want to appear before God. And the Bible says we shall all appear before him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't I know that when we appear before him, &gt;&gt; he never said, &gt;&gt; "I give you 60 points." &gt;&gt; 60 points. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. When we appear, as Paul says, &gt;&gt; we shall all appear before him. If I appear before the Instagram and in a way that I may dressed up, &gt;&gt; they give me maybe 100 &gt;&gt; points. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I get puffed up &gt;&gt; to make it 200 points. 200 points. But we want to appear before him. &gt;&gt; And when we appear, &gt;&gt; he will say, "You are the same with me." &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Oh, I I I think I I don't Do I have the book? &gt;&gt; We are We are blessed today." Here's the book here. Listen, &gt;&gt; although I was going to read something out of it for something, &gt;&gt; but it reminds me here when God was creating, I'm coming back to you again. &gt;&gt; Maybe this time we will catch up with it. &gt;&gt; When God was creating, you know, in creating, &gt;&gt; God didn't look at something and say, "Yeah, let let me make this one like that one." No, he looked to himself. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He looked to himself and said, "Let us make men in our image." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. We today we can't dress unless we look at somebody first and say nice then I'm going to dress like this one but not with God we don't look at another object he looks at himself even brother Brennham says God don't look at you. He even says God look don't look at me bren I quote &gt;&gt; he says he looks at Christ &gt;&gt; because Christ the mystery of God that is Christ. &gt;&gt; So the only way I can appease God that's when I look like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; you know at beauty contest, &gt;&gt; beauty contest, &gt;&gt; you need a blind man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They stand there with glasses, adjusting the glasses. I I figure when passing there you know we find that he is burning &gt;&gt; because they are half naked don't burn. So a judge bing also Tomorrow he leaves his wife in here that he bent that way when he was busy. &gt;&gt; Okay, brothers and sisters, these things are true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is Hallelujah? Amen. All right, let us leave the what? What do you call it? What do you call it? &gt;&gt; Instagram shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Instagram. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But he will remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if I can say to you, &gt;&gt; look at this glass. I said, &gt;&gt; and I said, look at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You keep looking as the minutes go, &gt;&gt; you get tired. &gt;&gt; You can't look at this last forever. Amen. Oh, the pastor is making me watch. But if I can say look at Jesus. Amen. Amen. The more you are looking at him, the more you look at him is the more you have the desire to look at him. Amen. Amen.

Peter looked at him once. and said the words of eternal life are with you since that day follow Jesus even today. Amen. Amen. The Samaritan woman came there were fishes and all hairs and what but when she saw Jesus not Instagram when she saw Jesus Amen. Amen. She took off the tattered garments and said I perceive &gt;&gt; you are the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And from that day She followed Jesus and the prophet comes and say it is because she was predestinated. A person that is predestinated, he has seen him &gt;&gt; or she has seen him &gt;&gt; and when he shall appear, &gt;&gt; she will see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let the name of Jesus be praised. &gt;&gt; Let's pass here. &gt;&gt; How shall he when we shall be with him and the saints? You can imagine New Jerusalem for all this time. &gt;&gt; He went there to prepare it. God won't surprise us as brother Brenham spoke that he's been there preparing that city. Amen. What a city. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine how it looks like? Then he comes and say when maybe you are thinking of flying saucer or sa he says when you are there you'll travel like in a thought meaning that you'd be where you want to be. Amen. But before we lose it, we still going &gt;&gt; until we wind up back again and show that this battle of Armageddon and we are going to turn like this. This battle of Armageddon is not the battle against Israel. is the battle against the coming of the Lord. That's why the rapture &gt;&gt; is for the people that are really God has uh let me say empty them or with all the powers of heaven. He is the most powerful. He has the whole world in on a tip of his finger like this. Satan, you are playing. As I said, what if God while we are breaking and saying things, God can stop the right in the middle of the day.
