Description:
Title: We Shall See Him As He Is Vol.2 
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 21 January 2024

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 8:1.  I Ephesians 4:30

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience that When he shall appear we shall be like him and see Him as he is.

The people that are going to the rapture they are changing their bodies. After the rapture we shall put on the new body.
During the time of Lot, the fire could not touch the anointed of God. We are at the end of Noah’s time.
We have an appointment with the Lord, just as he had an appointment with Abraham.

Some people want to see themselves, while others want to see Jesus. When he appears we shall be like him, as we were made in his shape, the supernatural shape. For him to identify us, is because he made us in his image, our identity is Christ,

For one to be perfect, it is when they have the eternal life. This is the time where everyone knows themselves. 
Reading doesn’t put you anywhere closer to God, but it is by Revelation. The bride on earth comes in a form of pyramid.

The people in the church are not in the same realm. We have a pull in us and that pull is the one that define where we are going. We are the bloodline child.

The bride of Christ is blessed today because she had a seed of God. A seed of Abraham is the doer of the word , not a church goer. If you can keep the word, then that word will keep the devil away from you. We have now moved on into the supernatural.

The prophet went to the west to pick up the angelic sermon and brought it back to the church.

There are people who are on the runway and sin will never catch up with them.

things you can't explain let's let's turn to the same scripture Revelation 8 verse1 and just that scripture Revelation 8 ver1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour right amen let's bow it our heavenly father we come to thee again this morning amen is the place of worship yes where your children who were preach destinated and were in your mind even before the foundation of the world Amen they are here to worship the that's right because they were born to worship that's right so glad that the Lord today he is with us in this house to bless each and every brother and sister to heal the sick amen to answer to those who have requests amen father we are so glad we know you are here to talk with with to us especially in this last days it's so wonderful to hear from you father we are waiting for that moment when in a twinkling of an eye we shall be taken up it can happen any time the signs are there so we are so glad bless us this morning Lord while we are waiting I'm so glad am that you have put this in my soul am that I I'm looking not at anything amen nothing is coming to me but the Lord Jesus Christ and there's nothing else that I see coming bless your children am bless the word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may remain seated for for a while we we went back to the same scripture here but we still going back back to uh like the white stone and that is the message now the notable one because we are coming closer to a time we shall change already we are changing if you can notice the people that are going in the changing already amen amen have you noticed that well last night yesterday we we had a a sister you know her but it's not the right time to identify her and then she said I think in the presence of some of the brothers uh she's as doing her rounds SE fire fire and but she was sent to look for a key and the brothers were there when she sat on the sofa and she start searching and uh she said I'm looking for a key it was here uh pointing to the site of s and uh then she explained to us that when asked what key is you talking about actually she says a key she says it is to open up because there's some demons that are locked in amen now they are looking for that key but they send the sister to come ask for that key the very same sister she came uh years back looking for a [Music] key which I want identify which key but if memories can serve brother he was with me when the same sister said I'm sent to you for the key amen amen and uh it was all over the place even they they found one in they are all talking about that key all right so meaning the key H they identify somebody as the holder of that all right so but you'll see him by God's grace she kept on talking about it is the end it is the it is it is the signs are there Lan Church age the end of ludian church age just like you know the Lord Jesus when asked about his coming the end of time he told them about the the time of lot the time of lot it was fire amen right amen when these things started that we see today of flats what have you seen before the flat thank you sisters there were fires all over especially starting from californ one day we will be able to tell you about this California as the prophet has narrated to us but it was fire all over that is lot after that then started that is Noah right amen now we are always uh on the brink yes we are at the end of Noah's time but in all all of these things Abraham was not involved fire couldn't touch the anointed of God and even today Satan will do nothing Amen to the anointed of God because uh they are going in the even if he knows that they are going in the rupture but he has no power to stop that all right amen let's we have ready so I'm going to go back to this a bit and we will go back we we are just in that region of the supernatural um while we in the church they are a people I call them the T dwellers amen amen they haven't yet seen the time that we are we are living in and of course if you don't pass to the other side you remain in darkness you don't even see that the Lord is coming you keep on doing your own things that's why it say the day shall come as a thief in the night a thief don't make appointments amen amen but to his we have an appointment Jes and we that we have an appointment with him amen amen as he had appointment with Abraham and at the appointed time he said shall I hide from Abraham this thing that I do that was before those angels went to amen am when the Angels before they started off he said shall I hide from Abraham shall he hide amen amen now the bride of Christ uh to say his wife she won't hide anything to his wife so we we we have read the scripture uh it says when he opened the now seven that's that [Music] number on the seventh day what did God do amen am so he did nothing on the so seven is a special number in the Bible okay that's why we have seven Church ages but we are on the tip the last Church [Music] age before the ruption amen amen amen but we are going to read for few minutes and uh now in this age he has opened our spiritual eyes so wide you even can be able to see those that that are and those that are not going still clinging to the things of the world because they don't see him all right amen uh that sister yesterday Brothers have had she said the she was talking of the rupture but saying only few you know when we were there the conference that brother also we said somewhere with my brother here in the message that we it's time time is over but he was also saying uh this brother of mine uh referring to one of us here saying he has some people and uh he's going together with those he he call them hey people so I was not surprised when this sister also said you are going with only a few and the brother also said that and the prophet confirmed that only few uh the church churches are full the people but undecided people they don't know where they are going now a person who is on a journey who is about to start off it's not by he's not like in the mood of somebody who is just relaxing and he's going nowhere amen amen can you identify this things there are people that are amen amen and checking of the things of the world knowing that they are going but they are those uh they will carry on with their own things all right amen while one wants to see himself or herself the other one wants to see Jesus because that's where he came from you know if you are from him the desire you have is to be like him amen amen what do you call [Music] that yeah you know identity when you some people want to to be like him I want to thank some sisters brothers those who realize that the time has arrived now because he keeps on changing the Lord changing us amen amen that's why he said when he shall appear we shall be like him amen amen it never said I shall be like myself amen if there's a good camera then God has one we were made in his shape the supernatural all right now let let us look at this and uh because um I reach some something here sometimes we look at the day of redemption sometimes back and if you can remember uh we I read from a [Music] place that says the day of redemption is the day the book is open that is the day of so meaning that like Paul says these things we preach to the perfect now in that book message book of Hebrews B I find this place where it says what is perfection what is to be perfect he says that's when you have eternal life nothing can be perfect unless eternal if it is not Eternal it is not perfect amen that's why you see the people that are not Eternal they can be perfect okay amen because you know you still remember that let us look at this all right we are all coming together Sundays conferences singing together amen but are we going together now because Paul says that's why we are going to have you seen that we have passed the [Music] church amen that means after passing the church it's a walk with God as it says you know walked with [Applause] God is there somebody who can understand that to walk with [Music] God meaning that your mind you are so mindful of God amen amen with God the Bible says how he pleased God he with God God was so pleased that he took it amen amen even now he's coming for those we like en the seventh man from and this is the seventh Church [Music] age from Paul the first church age now you see the Paul he went to the thir third heaven what a testimony amen then you count from Paul you come to S Elijah the prophet he was also taken to the six Dimension because as the forerunners must go before and come back you see amen so that's it amen but you can see that Enoch the seven the Bible very much interested in saying he is the seventh just like this seven Church age there's no other Church age that is coming is finished okay let us read this part here and uh we will is there some brethren to be baptized may the Lord bless them I was talking about the brothers even yesterday that but not to call any name this mama said to me some years back he said H there is some people they told her that we are waiting here for the pastor to come and take fures and then now she told me that and one day can I say it one day we were baptizing there was a baptism service then here appear some m I uh they they just they were in a in line like this almost the same age and when I look at them I couldn't make any difference to me they appeared to be in the same and uh I asked if brother can recall I asked him who are this m and he said I don't know then I was just thinking not knowing why I was concerned it's because they look to me somehow and what right is then I remember that that mama told me that there's some women they said we are waiting for the pastor to come in then I thought this should be those M then after that there was another service also in the two I do you still remember brother no that was a a group of boys young men also I question who are these people now people come and be baptized many times but I was concerned with and asking a question who are they then I think the brother will remind me if if I did ask him the same question where is this children from all right am okay now that's just that mm when he shall appear we shall be say we shall be like him furthermore it says and we shall see him as he [Music] is not not according to the description but you see him as you know to identify him it's not after somebody gives you a photo because you are like him amen amen so when you see him you'll be looking at yourself you know God made it so special and said let us make men in our image amen amen so for him to identify us he made us in his amen so when he looks at you he sees himself all right amen Pastor okay you know I like what brother Bram said one time have you seen that uh Rabbi you know there have been some uh people saying this calling this message calling it what some were even saying bram's cult then this Rabbi I I we have seen it he said I even asked a brother to make a cutting of that he said he said some something about brother and he said who will ever say something against that Prophet God will never forgive you all right because we take the scriptures now reading doesn't put you anywhere closer to God but Revelation that's the one that that I did identifies you amen amen and it gives you a divine nature you don't look at God like as you look at your photo amen you know I can look at my photo this is amen amen but still I will put it aside I want my real identity what is your real identity if you can say brother identify yourself I'll bring Christ amen [Applause] I'll tell you about Christ that's my identity I don't want to know about myself I want to know about him and identify myself we'll talk about it one day you know I have this book Christ is the mystery of God revealed H it tells me of my identity and this is the time for each and every one of us to know who he is where are you from where are you going amen amen that's why they say this world is not my [Music] home so I'm not here to build ation for me you know the reason why the Lord promised me ation and said we were in Cape Town one time and uh maybe you can go to New York New York York and see the buildings and all that beautiful places amen amen but you can Mees them with the city the city to come it is in the form of a pyramiden and the bride also here on Earth comes in the form of a [Applause] pyramid you remember that migration all right will come I was supposed to bring something here where it speaks of something but I think uh God would not let us touch that subject until you know the Bible says it SE to be with Sarah take it further according to the manner of women according to the manner of women but we'll come to that now today it ceas to be with the man to to the bride you know woman speaking about church it CE to be with sah according to the man of all right amen what does that mean I was trying to read it but it will take me out of my we are we are coming got it with I was trying to but then God wants us this morning just to look at this right you know Sarah sah they hey I had something here special wor if it's not here we will still have but that's where it says some will know Sarah sah Abraham and Sarah abrah the Lord God changed their body now you have another body amen but there's a h somebody in you that's going to occupy that body that's the one that's causing that deep hunger in you for wanting to leave this body your your your inner man is already choosing a new body because after the Rapture you are not in this body of Flesh amen amen you get into a new body that's why he says we shall Church and put off immortality to put on the moral amen amen so I don't know is there somebody here who has a desire to leave this body sure is there oh then we are in the right path the people I know now that are going in the Rapture they have a long a desire to change Amen to leave this body and go into their body amen it's not something that uh will'll be carried somebody to no it is that nature in you div the divine nature in you because that divine nature knows the time and so because this is the seventh Church ages amen amen now that nature um just like you reading the Bible it says in the beginning God created heaven and earth if you starta God created heaven and the Earth then comes another scripture Heaven and Earth shall pass away then where are [Music] you okay maybe somebody caught up with God created Heaven and the earth and the people shout hallel then comes another word says but Heaven and Earth shall pass away then comes another scripture where he says behold I make all things new amen all right amen so where are you now now there's somebody in You When Heaven and Earth shall pass away this is what that person in you is waiting for he's waiting for the newness of things amen and say my home is far away okay amen yeah I'm just uh passing through on Earth they say can you come and join us said no no no no I'm passing Abraham couldn't join l amen SE it's separation the people in the church they are not in the same real no some are passing on some are just worshipers a worshiper that is passing on and another worshiper who just enjoy to worship okay now let's finish this H I'm looking at my rest watch here and I believe we are looking for the last time at our rest watches where is that place again watch here before we go back to our Stone and one amen amen because what is pulling you what does that son say my is what is pulling did the song say so yes where's my brother yes I feel the pool is he here yes wa no brother yes he's here there is oh you you are going already okay what is pulling you theop yes my theop is pulling it's a secret you when the time arrives you are not going we are not trying to jump and is pulling you amen amen and when the the starts to pull this Earthly man start to sing but actually not this man but the inside starts to sing things like that amen oh wonderfully how wonderfully is our Lord amen now I we we we we we are looking at the Revelation 8 when he opened Heaven remain quiet right amen you know if you go back God used to create and present them to Adam and to see what Adam would say look at this now God creat something and he says Adam I have created this and the Bible says and Adam would give it a name if God presents something before Adam Adam says Thou Art a lion and God says [Applause] amen that's how it was like amen amen now if you are you have a pool that divine nature that was in Adam is in you pulling you I don't have something pulling me for the Instagram what is pulling me because I was made in the image not of Instagram but in the image of God that's the thing that is pulling me I don't want to see myself but I want to see Christ because according to the word we are [Applause] Christlike because God don't pick me from the Instagram because I am where in him all right now let's L this read this and close um you know Revelation 5 that scripture is wonderful it speaks of the book M of which Sons Daughters of God they know that book amen all right amen it's a great [Music] Association SE they know about that book and I'll bring you that part of it where it says the day of redemption is the day that book is open amen and you come because you have heard your your name was written in the book The LS Book of Life hallu stemed Through the blood of the Lord Jesus now you are a bline child that's why the king man when he saw you in a fallen stage he came knowing that only his blood bring you back you are kman hey brother you know if one day can you sit down you don't need to drink beer a bit be in your mind and uh read the Bible and see how God became your Kingman you are saved by the blood of the king's man now his death was not just death no when that's why when Mary uh the pregnant of Mary was was something else because she knew no man but an angel came and put Joseph aside because God wanted to plant his own SE that's why he said Mary you are blessed why blessed you are going to receive seed from God the bride of Christ today is blessed because she has received SE from God the Seven Seals and Mary could not deny [Music] it an angel came with the seed of God to Mary and said you are blessed the churches and gave her now the word now not just a scripture but the seed word we can read the same book but to the to others it's a SE to one person is just reading M amen but to the other one it is seed that's why somebody can come here and worship next time he decides to leave he didn't receive seed but someone came and he can never leave because this one has received seed that's the difference Lord make me a doer of amen not the church go okay amen do you listen not the church go but the doer of the way but let me tell you secret the Doer you can't do or let me bring the meaning of the doer of the it is because like if you are Seed of Abraham you are a [Music] doer of the way not a church member amen Lord was a church member of the but Abraham was the doer that was the difference between Abraham and Lord Abraham Abraham Lord oh L could hear Abraham saying the Lord says he could even say to his family I hear my brother here our pastor say saying that the Lord said to him but me also while praying I saw s yeah I was so blessed fertile well amen but Abraham did not see that Abraham saw the promised land now that one is not promised amen it is Lord the Lord who promised that they I'll be able to do agriculture yeah the saying amen right now we are here do we have the same [Music] vision no that young man worshiped his cell phone young people are the worshipers of but those that are in Christ amen [Music] amen they they have something Divine in them they worship God Amen now let me show you the difference there's some worshippers of the cell phone you know how it started uh it was a it came from being a lap oh what laptop laptop right now it came up to this now what do you call it you can't say laptop from the laptop when I was a young man we knew about gram you could put it flat on the floor there and wi change needles and that and that then things started to change till now today we we've got things mhm amen now it's Le Amen in even small children the first thing family mama or a daddy would like love to introduce to to his child he will offer the child a without even knowing how to talk already she's crying for a cell phone amen but you can't even talk I saw one even when I was flying we were flying I didn't know crying for and now I was watching the mama gave the child there was a talk show in the radio when somebody said today parents are ruled by their children amen you see a girl in this world working in the meest not me I don't know if you say how mama your child in this time of the Wolves walking the [Music] street and we are trying to display your child to the Wolves she say she's crying for it now you are controlled by this child now who is your parent and of course some parents they want to display their children and a demon what did that demon say about he said you hang your people I preach you know I preached but you were praying for that particular person but what did the de with okay uh but why why why why your mic is so fine who is there I mean why did the demon say you listen put well it had said that when people are using their cell phone or whatsoever and their pictures are there that's where the devil is getting them from there okay if is after I said something concerning that that the people they hang their children Satan to come and them that was that but the demon confirmed that all right okay Brothers now let's take our real picture here now and close H when he opened this is what we were waiting for the people who were fashioned in His image were waiting for that day when they shall see themselves in Christ as he says when he shall appear we shall be like amen all right when when not when the screen is switched on yeah that's another screen now it's calling you home when that screen opens up that person in you leaves the [Applause] natural uh did you hear that it is like you are working in the natural body like this pains TR this and that that's why every day we have there prayer requests because we are have you ever heard of any prayer request in heaven no there won't be a prayer request but here because we are still in this body we come and ask for prayers it's a good thing to ask for prayer for God will answer you if sincerely you know that God answers prayer amen all right amen that uh sister yesterday where I think brothers were there already she said that I feel pain here the side of my body were you there Baba yes and what I did the brother will say amen I took her hand like this and I said put your hand where the pain she did that and immediately she said it's no longer there amen amen amen because if you are a child of God you can transfer [Applause] why we are singing there is power power Samson knew that he had power in him amen and uh every time you would leave home to go [Music] somewhere you you've never seen him with Dum balls the Bible says she had a Nazarite vow now the power was not in the head the secret was not was not in the head but the secret was in the heart but God said unless he keeps the The Naz until you you you must keep it the na amen amen if Satan comes he doesn't look at you he looks at what's in you then he can pick it up that there's nothing in there there's doubt en Satan knows that when it comes to those things he becomes a commander as long as they existing you the devil is delighted all right amen now even the Philistines they didn't know the power of sson they only saw the logs but the power was not in the L was in the heart of as long as Samson kept the logs the power as long as you keep the virtues the power remains with as long as you can keep the word of God in you is with not because you lift up because of the secret that is in then the power because sin is like a rat sin destroys [Music] like a red in your kitchen all right amen you find yourself becoming weak and and you pray but if you pray God says go and do my [Music] will if you do the will of the Lord then God performs he's a great performer but only if you can keep his way because God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God let me close with this I it goes with this the Bible says brother that scripture grieve not Ephesians grieve not the Holy Spirit what it says Ephesians 4:3 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed and until the day of redemption amen just keep keep it there you are sealed unto day of the word redeem meaning to take something back to his original if it is back if you are back in your original please they say you are redeemed why because Satan couldn't beat you or to overcome Satan could overc butson Satan will never overcome you but as long long as you keep the word of God now you can keep the L but if you don't keep the way the can shave amen it is a naite v no razor shall [Music] if you can keep the way then it will keep Satan at Bay all right now that's that is the thing lastly why we are struggling so much and you read the Bible says if you believe him all things are possible and the people they say I believe but nothing is possible does that mean he's a liar no there's something wrong if you believe there at the conference confence I was with the brothers a sister with my husband they came to my office there I was with the brothers and then she said I feel something in me like in my body running to like and then uh I think we were with Pastor Edgar Ed now I said put your hand where the thing is she did that then I touch her hand right knowing that she believes that I'm her her pastor when I did that she said it's no longer there now there are some people it is hard for them to believe God they believe that there was a sister from I don't know whether the sister still exist around the she couldn't walk and this and that then we prayed for her and uh she got healed then one day she came to me uh if she is here uh you don't know you don't know her I won't identify her it's just a testimony and she came uh one day said uh I went to see a doctor I said yes okay then she said now uh she spoke something about like having received the medication now I said were you sick she said no I just went for a checkup are you still trying to confirm that God has healed but I didn't say this no in my heart I said that that means the sister is not sure she's not sure of her healing amen amen because you know God just said let there be light [Music] and and there was light because even nature obeyed the word of God because the son it's natural but nature obeyed God now I said sister God has healed you but it looks like you doubt the word of God power of God you still go and say doctor examine me amen amen instead of going around singing amen amen the great phys now is [Music] here amen ah now from the sympathizing Jesus you went to medical doctor after you were [Music] healed I'm not saying you should not see the doctor I'm not saying that I'm talking about the sister got healed after the healing he went for a check I said what for because I wanted to make sure do you want to make sure that God Is A Healer sister tell me you want to make sure that God Is A Healer oh no answer all right I'm closing with this the lamb we have read the scripture but we haven't touched it when he opened the the seventh there are so many books but when he open the seven it was all the seventh now you read about the seventh day the seventh Church age seven and the prophet says seven seven is a completion and there is always a mystery amen how would that's why at this seven Church age you have some Churches but there is a there is a SE there is the Seed of Abraham that's God's mystery hated by the real real seven because all these ages at the end you want to see the shape that the seven Church ages brought now can read about the first but the real real real thing go to the seventh it's a reflection of all these others because you count one to seven is the end we we we have read that in the book where it says when you hit seven where are you going when you come to seven that's why uh seven the weddding that's why we against that wedding on the seventh day you've seen the previous week we started with service service service which is the [Applause] resurrection amen amen and because it just happened like that but we will always encourage the children of God that Sunday is reserved as the day of Resurrection amen amen in the day of Resurrection they were not dancing and waiting that's when the graves open and came came forth the mighty [Music] warrior he has overcome death for you and me all right amen and he carries with him the power of [Applause] Resurrection when there was a shout okay let me say to you I'm closing these books that power came down from heaven okay and what happened when he it arrived in Jerusalem they were gathered together in a room or was it a tabernacle or a room amen amen the power came in them then they started to speak in tongues so it was the opening of the church service there were tongues and so forth okay amen the opening and that very power went to the graves and what happened when it arrived there the graves opened up it is the power that will take you in the Rapture amen amen amen it went to the graves and the graves [Applause] opened now what you call ancestors is the people who did resurrect now you've got to follow them to the graves we are here we are your children the then what happens you say h I tell you last night I saw my grandmother coming to me and she was buried what you have seen is [Music] demon if you worship a dead person there's a demon that represents that person if he was not a Christian he died being not a Christian and you you you you call upon that that's why ancestral worship is of the [Applause] Demons it's a demon that will come to represent somebody else go grandmother because she's calling upon the dead but not the angel of the Lord no a demon comes and say and the person comes tomorrow and say I tell you the truth I have seen my mother in-law last night she came and she was mother-in-law as I know but that is a demon representing because you want to talk to the dead now a demon comes to represent your dead [Music] relative I've got my brother and my sister here they came for somewhere a girl was [Music] buried but they keep on [Music] seeing image home amen I won't talk about it now but I said by God's grace we'll go to see the family he comes and greet sit there but what they know okay we know something about witchcraft that's why today wichcraft today let me close I'll come back even musicians today most of them they start their career after they have they are soul did you know that there there are some people working this Earth without [Music] Souls do you know that because they want fame just like the people who want to be seen hey they can go to extremes just to appear to people amen amen you find them on the screen because they want to be popular oh man what is a man they want to be popular want to be known for what we used to [Music] sing amen amen it is the goodness of knowing him amen amen do you know him sister do you know him brother because if you don't know him you cannot worship Him in spirit because he says the true worshipers God in spirit and not just a spirit if you come in the spirit then the people with Revelation they are not taken up like that amen they they look whether it is from God there was a certain mama he knew something about a certain preacher a certain denomination and that man he he he he came saying to the people I went to pray up in that mountain for God to give me power amen amen then this mama knew about this man if when she said I went there to pray for power the people close to that se close to
