[0:00] watch great mystery of Love expressed
[0:08] that God and Men became one
[0:12] um
[0:15] amen amen
[0:18] now we can stand therefore therefore
[0:21] ages
[0:23] God and Men became
[0:25] one
[0:29] amen
[0:31] um
[0:32] some people
[0:36] as I discovered that the enough
[0:41] once said
[0:45] maybe I can use this name godima one
[0:47] certain kodima thinks that he is god
[0:50] um
[0:56] and I said
[0:58] but
[1:00] and I said
[1:02] um
[1:04] God himself said
[1:07] let us make men in our image
[1:14] amen now if you say somebody is making
[1:18] himself god
[1:20] um
[1:23] it is because you can never hate God
[1:26] when he said let us make men in our
[1:28] image
[1:38] that means
[1:41] if you want to see a genuine man
[1:50] that is in the image who is in the image
[1:53] of God
[1:56] [Applause]
[1:58] let's look at the original things now
[2:02] because it says
[2:04] amen and
[2:08] the whole thing is God and Men
[2:16] let's look at it now
[2:21] is
[2:26] amen that is the whole thing
[2:30] foreign God
[2:33] and Men amen
[2:37] because men
[2:39] is the destination of God
[2:42] [Music]
[2:43] um
[2:49] all right amen you see we we have today
[2:52] some prophets and what was coming in and
[2:55] out now I'm saying is
[3:00] until they they are sailing now what
[3:03] they call the blood of Jesus and
[3:06] all those things we
[3:17] of the
[3:20] Supernatural
[3:24] we are not looking at water oil and all
[3:27] those things
[3:30] because the ministry now
[3:33] is producing
[3:35] the original things
[3:41] the Bible never said in the beginning
[3:43] was water and oil and what if I feel
[3:46] like
[3:51] now it's
[3:53] easy the whole thing is Golden man
[3:57] God and man was one who taken home
[4:05] so if God and man was one
[4:13] in the beginning
[4:19] what do we expect at the end you don't
[4:23] understand
[4:25] Amen in the beginning was the word
[4:29] it has to end up as the wage amen
[4:35] otherwise it hasn't reached the
[4:38] destination
[4:40] it is still in the processary
[4:47] amen
[4:48] amen amen
[4:53] and person if if you preach the message
[4:57] we were in the denominations
[5:01] then they say and he took the book from
[5:05] the one set on the throne
[5:07] [Music]
[5:15] you took the book
[5:18] from the one
[5:21] only also on the throne
[5:24] um
[5:26] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[5:30] that's not it's not there's no message
[5:32] there
[5:35] amen
[5:37] after he took the book what happened
[5:42] the ministry the message can't just say
[5:45] he took the book from the one who sat on
[5:48] the throne
[5:51] and then
[5:55] amen after that they call for prayer
[5:58] life
[6:01] received their message
[6:04] amen
[6:06] they end up we've been prayed foreign
[6:34] whatever
[6:46] it's much on prayer life
[6:49] because out of that they can make Fame
[6:52] they can get famous
[6:55] and the money amen amen prayer line ends
[7:00] up as a business
[7:04] all right
[7:06] brother Branham also prayed for the
[7:08] people no brother
[7:10] but what was supernaturally
[7:14] your book perfect faith
[7:19] perfect face perfect it says if you have
[7:22] perfect Faith
[7:24] what do you need in the prayer
[7:32] amen
[7:34] and he says
[7:36] oti
[7:37] if you
[7:39] administered don't believe or don't have
[7:42] faith for uh you know you know you know
[7:46] um faith is the Sixth Sense
[7:48] foreign
[8:22] why
[8:26] he can use oil
[8:37] those things were bringing how the
[8:40] prophet speaking about the prayer and
[8:42] oil and Faith okay
[8:49] one was trying to explain to the people
[8:51] also saying um
[8:54] it was by saying that Jesus also used
[8:58] mud at one time 82 years now
[9:06] boost up their thing of selling a whale
[9:10] what and what else is
[9:16] now now I said in in
[9:21] Swaziland that they again when I was
[9:25] talking to the people there in a
[9:27] tentative
[9:30] have you ever seen Jesus going around
[9:33] with some bottles of mud
[9:35] maybe labeled an ended matches
[9:49] it was for a certain peoples that the
[9:52] Lord Jesus
[9:54] said to that blind man
[9:56] how
[10:10] um
[10:12] and right ask them also a question
[10:16] If a person comes counters and
[10:22] he is given water they don't they buy
[10:25] this water from the ministers
[10:29] now they always tell you that the pastor
[10:34] prayed for the water
[10:38] now my question is is it the water that
[10:42] is sick or the person
[10:45] um
[10:48] because the Bible say pray for the sick
[10:51] not for the water
[10:53] I am
[10:55] okay let's let's get let's come back
[10:59] here amen God and men who are sworn
[11:03] there and God and Men is one year
[11:14] God cannot change
[11:17] is God in men
[11:21] that's his manifestation
[11:26] manifesting manifestation means
[11:30] God is in
[11:34] I know it's called Brothers wake up a
[11:38] manifestation means
[11:40] God is in a man
[11:48] God was manifested
[11:52] in flesh
[11:54] so God was manifested that that's when
[11:58] God is in a man is a manifestation
[12:04] amen amen amen okay now
[12:09] let's take it from there
[12:14] another thing is no
[12:19] it says God and
[12:24] you come to men
[12:28] okay
[12:30] amen
[12:32] so now
[12:37] the word was made
[12:40] foreign
[13:10] as attributes
[13:12] we were one with God
[13:17] because we were in his mind
[13:22] God I knew you before
[13:26] now this is only the figures
[13:30] which is the ability
[13:33] but we we are not these bodies
[13:42] the man is inside
[13:47] as man was inside of God
[13:51] God is inside of the man
[13:55] he started with God in a man in God
[14:00] now it ends up with God man God in it
[14:04] started with man in God
[14:07] now it's God in a man
[14:11] amen okay amen now we we are trying to
[14:16] pave a way for the seven seal what is
[14:18] the seventh seal
[14:25] now
[14:27] brother Branham says
[14:30] the servant seal if you understand
[14:35] started back there amen
[14:41] in this form
[14:44] I want us to
[14:47] I don't know what is the time I don't
[14:50] trust this watch unless amen
[14:55] okay but let me read one something here
[14:59] because
[15:02] amen you are going to see something
[15:06] you know if you can hear the prophet of
[15:09] God
[15:12] I was even reading it right now before I
[15:15] started for this place
[15:19] but I'm going to make sure that I read
[15:21] it before we we leave this place this is
[15:27] God is behind your skin
[15:37] you know
[15:38] they mystery today in the secret the
[15:41] Deep secret is where God is
[15:45] against
[15:49] amen foreign
[16:05] [Music]
[16:17] spiritual
[16:37] Moya
[16:40] as the Bible says
[16:43] they said is properly identified
[16:50] we know
[16:51] where it is
[16:56] amen we we he says we know amen
[17:03] amen
[17:05] let's get into a serious thing now yeah
[17:10] for the Bible says you you shall know
[17:15] you know the thing is if the people
[17:18] don't know yeah
[17:24] in a very tricky situation but when the
[17:28] wind where there is no knowledge
[17:31] foreign
[17:51] he is he becomes vulnerable
[17:56] to any kind of teaching now
[17:58] because he doesn't
[18:03] amen amen amen amen
[18:07] if a student
[18:10] doesn't know the first man who
[18:13] discovered diamond in diamond in South
[18:16] Africa
[18:18] South Africa is vulnerable
[18:24] because somebody can come in and say it
[18:27] was foreign
[19:06] if she doesn't know
[19:10] [Music]
[19:11] anybody can come and teach anything
[19:16] now Goku
[19:20] has stated okay now here I've got
[19:23] brother brand name here
[19:26] and then he says
[19:29] uh
[19:31] secret that I must
[19:33] I must say much about it is
[19:38] and as he told me in the beginning
[19:44] this is nothing of it
[19:47] so
[19:56] and uh
[19:58] um
[19:59] it speaks for itself
[20:02] why okay amen amen
[20:09] don't say anything
[20:12] it's for it it speaks for itself why
[20:18] amen
[20:19] Hallelujah the Lord Jesus said
[20:24] Peter
[20:25] Peter
[20:27] Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to
[20:29] you
[20:33] after Peter he said thou and the Christ
[20:35] son of the Living God
[20:40] because in the
[20:42] name
[20:43] it was an offense to say Jesus is the
[20:46] Christ
[20:47] [Music]
[20:49] talk
[20:53] because
[20:55] and because it was a revelation
[20:59] to say Jesus is the Christo
[21:04] amen
[21:07] so when Peter said Thou Art
[21:10] the Christ
[21:13] Jesus says Flesh and Blood oh yes
[21:19] that means it didn't come through
[21:21] theology is
[21:28] are not taught of any man
[21:32] but it is my father
[21:37] Thou Art blessed
[21:40] because my father
[21:42] spoke through you
[21:45] amen I am the Christ
[21:49] son it speaks for itself
[22:00] [Music]
[22:01] you know listening to somebody speaking
[22:09] make it out whether he is speaking or
[22:13] something is speaking
[22:15] um
[22:19] I don't have the book but let me quote
[22:22] to you another brother says
[22:40] nothing but the truth why
[22:47] this she has said
[22:51] from
[22:53] God
[22:55] this learner she never said this from
[22:59] that from from the
[23:02] from here
[23:09] when she said brother Branham that is
[23:12] the truth
[23:19] God spoke through him
[23:25] foreign
[23:41] [Music]
[23:47] [Music]
[24:03] I
[24:09] am the son of man am the Christ
[24:16] because it must speak for itself amen
[24:21] [Applause]
[24:24] because
[24:35] it was the father who answers
[24:39] amen
[24:44] amen yeah it was God in the sunship
[24:52] now in the cycle
[24:54] unfortunately
[24:57] when he speaks something
[25:00] it comes through is now he himself
[25:06] spoke of himself as the Christ
[25:12] was supposed to be confirmed here
[25:19] you know you God has put you as somebody
[25:23] as a a room he should confirm his word
[25:37] are we together amen
[25:42] you are a person yes
[25:53] not to say anything foreign
[26:27] [Music]
[26:29] my brother amen I will read it in the
[26:32] Bible here what's my Bible I don't know
[26:35] okay amen
[26:37] DJ where's my Bible
[26:42] amen all right amen okay let me read
[26:46] that in the Bible amen
[26:54] what is the time here and what time I
[26:57] should be
[26:59] wrapping up
[27:01] if you can put it on a note because
[27:04] sometimes I forget what
[27:09] a man
[27:13] I I I I I want to use this so to read
[27:17] a bit
[27:21] fast
[27:22] I will let's go to the first book of
[27:26] John John
[27:31] amen
[27:33] now we we
[27:36] are wondering what we we are trying to
[27:40] fight what is the seventh seal this is
[27:46] why why the prophet says God said
[27:50] nothing
[27:54] amen because God is worshiped in seven
[27:57] yeah
[28:01] I said
[28:02] brother masito was there when we were in
[28:06] Gabon in Congo I repeated the same thing
[28:08] that
[28:09] yeah
[28:12] the revelation of the
[28:15] children
[28:18] okay
[28:19] now if you find somebody
[28:21] if you find somebody
[28:24] with this book
[28:27] the revelation of the seventh seals
[28:30] saying to you the servant is not
[28:33] revealed
[28:36] take that book from him
[28:43] tell him to produce his the revelation
[28:47] of six sins because this one is say
[28:50] seven amen
[28:58] food
[29:09] amen then why don't you say
[29:12] that your book says the revelation of
[29:16] the Seven Seals
[29:21] amen
[29:23] amen
[29:26] okay amen
[29:29] with this book in your hand
[29:32] somebody saying to you
[29:35] is not revealed
[29:38] but the book says the revelation of the
[29:42] Seven Seals
[29:47] it
[29:55] so I can't say Amen to somebody saying
[29:57] it is not revealed
[30:00] if it is
[30:03] the number of men not of God you stand
[30:06] out
[30:13] hey six is the number of men seven is
[30:16] the number of God
[30:19] foreign
[30:47] the bride of one
[30:50] talking about the bread group I'm
[30:54] my wife my husband says
[30:59] amen you better take it from the wife
[31:03] um
[31:08] if you want to know about the man
[31:10] daughter
[31:14] ask
[31:16] foreign
[31:32] now if you want to know anything
[31:35] about God
[31:37] you should ask the the bright
[31:43] amen
[31:46] when God the prophet says
[31:50] God was a
[31:53] sin as the seven colors
[32:01] uh-huh
[32:06] no
[32:07] amen
[32:09] and brother Brandon says
[32:14] condescended into logos
[32:20] amen we are coming to the men
[32:24] now the logos
[32:26] is still this seven yeah
[32:30] he says all these seven what's the
[32:33] strongest condescended into
[32:55] because the whole thing
[32:58] one condescended was seven downwards oh
[33:05] you as a man
[33:07] if you are in the image of God
[33:13] because now that's why you can contain
[33:17] seven you alone
[33:27] it will take a Seven Fold container to
[33:31] contain
[33:32] standard
[33:49] six seals container cannot contain seven
[33:56] days
[33:57] are still over
[34:00] this is
[34:01] okay
[34:02] all right
[34:04] now
[34:06] as we've got it like this the logos
[34:10] is the weight it is amen the logos is
[34:16] Christ who Christ amen according to the
[34:21] Prophet
[34:23] non-profit God condescended
[34:36] um
[34:44] God has no beginning but the beginning
[34:47] of the unfolding
[34:50] God
[34:57] a God was me the way it was made
[35:05] Among Us
[35:08] and we saw his glory amen
[35:15] it was made flesh when it was made flesh
[35:20] then we saw his glory
[35:24] amen
[35:25] all right amen
[35:27] now
[35:29] yeah
[35:33] when he opened the seventh
[35:38] time
[35:40] it was all
[35:42] the Bible says silence
[35:46] okay amen now Kobo I I said to a brother
[35:51] if you could catch this I will buy him
[35:54] Coke
[36:04] the first man here I can say
[36:11] let's let's put this one now as Adam the
[36:14] first man then
[36:17] now the prophet says
[36:20] Adam or Adam
[36:22] was not the destination
[36:26] Adam is the spirit that came from God
[36:32] came into Adam the nature
[36:38] station
[36:41] made of
[36:43] foreign
[37:15] Jesus was part of the
[37:22] is
[37:24] it yes
[37:27] it's very important to put it here amen
[37:30] so the Adam this was it the part of the
[37:35] Earth
[37:36] God
[37:43] breath into Adam
[37:46] Breath of Life
[37:50] which was the prophet says this the man
[37:54] Adam Who Came From God
[37:58] God process process is the attribute
[38:05] the attribute
[38:09] and but as he says with Adam my past
[38:17] so the Spirit came into the body so um
[38:23] they became a living souls
[38:27] he bypassed this
[38:31] which is also funny
[38:37] it is logos
[38:44] it's a thing that you can't see
[38:55] foreign
[39:37] to be put in a body
[39:40] he could not die as a theophone
[39:44] he had to come into a body that could
[39:47] die
[39:49] a body that came through a woman
[39:53] um
[39:55] because a man born of a woman has but
[39:59] few days
[40:03] now here we
[40:04] we start with Adam
[40:07] God molded things in heaven
[40:10] now you have here heaven
[40:13] and you have
[40:16] the yes
[40:19] okay amen we're trying to make things
[40:22] easier
[40:27] things in heaven
[40:35] things and sent them down too
[40:40] amen
[40:47] okay right amen
[40:51] just to confirm all right here we have
[40:54] this
[40:57] here we have this
[41:00] God moved things in heaven
[41:07] and said nothing
[41:14] foreign
[41:51] foreign
[42:06] amen
[42:08] okay
[42:10] right amen
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] God said something
[42:19] amen Genesis chapter 2 from verse 19 and
[42:23] 20. okay next chapter 2 verse 19 yes and
[42:28] out of the ground of
[42:30] and out of the ground the Lord God
[42:33] formed every beast of the field and
[42:35] every fowl of the air and brought them
[42:37] unto Adam to see what he will call them
[42:41] and what to see to see
[42:45] what he will call them right
[42:49] and whatsoever Adam called
[42:53] every living creature that was the name
[42:56] thereof
[42:58] and God said amen
[43:05] after 2 verse 19 yeah yeah
[43:19] um
[43:31] because
[43:36] God is the god of the universe
[43:39] Adam was the god of the Earth
[43:49] was the other contract
[43:52] the other side of the contract
[43:56] with God
[43:59] they were one
[44:03] foreign
[44:17] foreign
[44:56] [Music]
[45:17] but you and me and you again
[45:26] who cannot be worshiped foreign
[46:11] amen he made he made such to worship Him
[46:15] I mean
[46:16] God made some little Gods to worship him
[46:22] and he gave them Authority
[46:26] as gods and say pray for the sick what
[46:30] baptize them
[46:32] give them the way
[46:35] you are responsible
[46:38] I put responsibility upon you
[46:41] I am God
[46:44] you are God of the Earth
[46:53] you must name them
[47:01] nothing then here is God Of Heaven god
[47:03] of the universe
[47:10] he sends it down to Adam
[47:14] to see yeah he never said Adam that is a
[47:19] lion
[47:20] you send them without saying anything
[47:24] then for Adam to name them
[47:30] after Adam has named them everything
[47:38] amen
[47:43] God bolded things in heaven
[47:47] and kept quiet watula
[47:50] amen God opened the seven seal we took
[47:53] off
[47:56] amen
[47:58] because brother Branham says
[48:07] amen
[48:09] amen
[48:12] amen
[48:15] did you see it in the seven syllables
[48:19] I'll read it to you next time
[48:22] the secret yeah
[48:26] is beneath the seventh sea amen
[48:32] amen showing that
[48:35] if God says something
[48:37] foreign
