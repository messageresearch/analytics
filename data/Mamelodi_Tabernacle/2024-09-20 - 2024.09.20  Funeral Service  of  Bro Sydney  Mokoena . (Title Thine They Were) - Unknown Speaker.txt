just continue talking as they are fixing the mic hello amen why are we using English fellow they are live streaming trying to accommodate some other people that inland and some are even in another part of of the count different countries so that is the reason we are using English so we would like to create the family and the their neighbors too and and everybody that is here we are here just to have some few words of [Music] fellowship before maybe we go to the cemetery may the Lord bless you we will always read on the scriptures because that's where the life is especially in moments like this I would like to read John chapter 17 and then I will read verse 6 and S John 17 John chapter 17 I'll read only verse 6 and S okay it says here in English I have manifested thy name unto the man which thou has givest me uh out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them to me and they have kept my word Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee shall we bow our heads and and have our [Music] dimension for may be seated okay we are gathered here just to have some uh few words of consolation to the family the family of which we fellowship with them so now there's nobody that can uh have uh good words of condolences except God man comes from God and then he will go back to God so we have read here verse six it's our Lord here he said I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou has given me so he was here to manifest said now I have manifested thy name to the men which thou Gest me out of the world th uh they were that's what I want to speak about that the title will be D they [Music] were in other words in other words he says these people are yours mine was just to come and manif your way now if these people are God's people and he come just to manifest his name then they will never lose a direction because he says my sheep hear my voice they will always keep the direction so now our lord Jesus when he was here on Earth was not here to show off that he is Jesus but there was a prophecy about him the prophet says a virgin shall conceive and bear a son now he was he was here to manifest those words the son that was spoken about it's himself but he didn't say the son that was spoken about is my son now he manifested the word of God because Gabriel the angel of God came to Mary and said to Mary thou shall you will bear a child and you and then when she when when he said thou sht bear a child started by saying thou shall conceive and bear a child now those are the words that come from the angel now where did the angel get those words the angel got those wordss from God himself in other words those were the words of God that Mary you will con and bear a son now the son came now to manifest those words that were spoken by the angel are we together now here he says those people are yours says they are thine now I am here to manifest those words in other words he cannot manifest the words that were not spoken by God it's God that says these people are yours and then it's his son that says father I came to manifest your weight that is why now when we are here on the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 in verse four he says we were in him are we together amen our life does not start here in our lives has got no beginning are we together amen we were not created no we we were processed from his mind are we together now we were processed from his mind that's why he said now my my my sheep will hear my voice that's why when he says let us make men in our image he was communicating he was talking to us in him himself there was nobody here on Earth the Bible says in the beginning God created heaven and earth before the before everything was there now in in in first in in Ephesians 1 verse 4 says we were in him before the foundation of the world now if we were in him before the foundation of the world now before the foundation of the world there was nobody it was God all by himself and his mind so we were with together with him there now if we were together with him there then we will never lose a direction we are his children the Bible says nobody no no one knows the father except the son so the son manifest the son that is the one that is manifesting because he was the one that was in the bosom of the father when you say when the Bible say he was in the bosom of the father it means he was in his father and then his father is the one that processed him now we were together with him that's why now the words of consolation is that one day this is the body of the man that surrender his soul to his creator I always remind people that they have souls lot and number of people are not aware that they are not what they are like I'm sending here I Amana but I know that I'm not are we together Scana is this flesh which is born out of my parents but within me there is a soul then that Soul does not come from my parents that Soul come from my Creator now that I was not created then I was processed then that Soul should be H in line coordinates with the one that has processed me remember God gave us a heart and in that heart there is what we call Soul are we together and when God speaks to us he speaks to us through that Soul remember that we've got a mind the Mind controls the body and when the devil speaks to us he speaks through our mind in the Garden of Eden the the serpent went to to to to Eve and Ted his mind he went to the mind of God mind I mean the mind of of of of Eve and tested the Mind mind is there for argument mind is there for reasoning when we want to reason when we want to argue argue through our minds we argue through our intelligence but God does not come to your intelligence come to your mind God goes right to your heart that's where life is that's who you are you are the soul and that's why God after creating a man he took his soul and put it in that man so that he can communicate when God communicate with you communicates with your mind with your heart thank you my brother are we together but then if God seek your soul and could not find you then we are not his remember there are those that are condemned there are those that are let me put it this way the Bible says there are angels that kept not their first are we together they did not keep their first estate as you are your first estate is the mind of God [Music] the mind of God God gave you an estate and the estate of has to do with the kingdom of God can I repeat myself there are people that are ordained for condemnation you read it in the book of Jude in verse six the the angels that kept not their First Estate they condemned they ordained for condemnation there are those you read it in the book of Acts 13:47 it says there are those that are ordained for eternal life now those that are are ordained for eternal life they are his they will never miss a point they will never miss their creator when their creator calls they could hear that my father is talking but there are those that will never hear his voice they don't even care about his voice they will never care about his voice are we together now the consolation to the family is that the man syney had the voice and surrendered his life now when we console the family we console them through those words that he repented repentance is to give your life over to God and then God have got his own way of directing you how to live and if you don't give your life to God then God cannot direct you God want to have a touch with you god want to have a contact with you god want to speak to you want to you to respond and the response is thisi my Lord and when you say here am I my Lord then you surrender the Bible says he that believe then he should repent and be baptized in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ he that heard the word of God then he repents and be baptized now repentance is to turn around and say now I am not living this type of life now I change now now he's the one that will take care of you God can never take care of you if you are not his own he take care of his own he says my sheep hear my voice when my sheep hear my voice I take care of them that is why now when he was here he said father I have manifested thy name he was yet to manifest thy name unto the man which thou has given out of was given me out of the world you hear what he's saying amen he says I am manifesting only to those men that you have given me right amen thine you have given me those people because they were yours that's why he says dying they were are we together amen and you gave them to me and I then they have kept thy weight there is no way that you can worship god without keeping his way because he's the one that pulls you he's he pulls you towards himself you are not doing a favor it's your life you don't worship God because you want to do him a favor there is no other way that we can do there is no other life that we can live are we together so now he says now in verse S verse now they have known that all thing whatsoever thou has given me are of Thee so all things that God has given you you must know that belongs to him there's nothing that you have except that God gives you right I want to go on with this until verse but before I go there I want to go to verse 39 in in in chapter 6 6 ver9 I would like us to know that now uh man does not die yesterday evening I was showing I I was saying talking about the departure if somebody departs like our brother here has Departed then which means then he must come back he must return He has departed but the dead person is the one that will never see God again maybe to put you in the picture is like this we are here on and if the H arrives just tell me I'm looking at the watching we are here on this planet Earth there is also the world in this planet we in this planet Earth there is the world in this earth now uh if there is a world in this earth there are people of the world the world is controlling this planet and you'll find that most of the world is contrary to the word of God now why are we waiting for the coming of the Lord there are people that are so ignorant they don't I was also like that then they are not aware actually where we are right now the only thing that they know uh is of the world is that maybe Putin is is fighting with another country there's this thing that's happening in America there's this thing that's happening they they are concerned about their life they are environment which is good you must know what's going on in in the world but there are a physical part of life there are spiritual part of life now the spiritual part is not seen by a naked eye now most people are ignorant of the spiritual part [Music] now let me just now now educate you spiritually we are living on this planet they've got two forces here there's one force that will drag you to eternal life to the kingdom of God there's another force that will drag you to another kingdom King the kingdom of this world we've got two uh forces now in teing them we say another force is draging you to its own kingdom now there are people then who are ignorant who are not aware of that who doesn't even care they don't even pray they didn't even try to contact God they just wake up and go to work and come back wake up go to school come back they don't have any contact with the spirit there is the spirit of God that really contacts you that you need to communicate with on daily basis on hourly basis on every minute a spirit that you need to contact you because one day look when God created you he God has created You Out of the Dust of the earth he formed Men Out of the Dust of the the body itself it is useless there's nothing worth of this body when when when when you are dead they cannot sell you and say this you worth nothing your body worth nothing are we together if you've got the gold teeth take it out because at least it worth something your ring they will take it out it worth something but your body worth nothing are you together now what happens what makes the body worth something is the spirit that God breathe into that body God breathe a spirit into that and then that spirit is to keep that body alive when that Spirit goes out of that body the body there's nothing that you can do you can clap it and do whatever you want it won't rise up it needs a spirit that will raise it up are we together now what happens now that spirit is out of the body now that spirit is to keep the body alive and then when God want to speak to that individual he gives it the soul and the Soul gave you a nature are you together when you were born you were born with your family nature but now your family nature is not of God it's of your family are we together now in your family you will say in our family we don't allow this and this and this that is your family but now one day you will have to change your nature your nature now become Divine and then when it's divine your nature changes now it's no more your family nature you will have two Natures now Paul says I have two of them my physical nature draws me to my family but now the supernatural one which is deep within me is calling me towards called so now you have to balance the two Natures while I am a being belonging toana yet Within Me there is a soul which belongs to God are we together when the word comes it goes to my soul when my father comes comes to my human nature he speak me as my father in human nature but God comes also as a father now I'll be having two fathers my biological father when he speaks to me he speak to me as my biological father my Supernatural Father which is my Divine father he comes to me and speak me as my Divine father I have to balance my this is my my my my biological father and this is my spiritual father but who is bigger higher stronger the two father the two fathers where does my father come from he was formed by God where does my spiritual father come from which is God himself No Beginning No End no beginning of Life no ending of life which is the better father not that your biologic is not good he raised you up good taking you to school he's done everything wonderful father what you have done is good we still respect you but there is no one but there's one that has got no beginning there no end so rather I will go for this one because I don't want to end because I don't have a beginning to now the inner man which is my soul has got no beginning has got no end because it's that father are you are we together who okay Mary gave birth to their son Jesus whose father was Jesus because the angel came and said thou shall conceive conceive what and bear a son the Bible says Joseph wanted to get rid of Mary right am because she has [Music] conceived now Mary meet Gabriel then Gabriel said you you will conceive and then Mary says I don't have any man and the Gabriel says the spirit of the Lord will overshadow you right amen the spirit will overshadow you and you will bear a son and then what did Mary say Mary said Let It Be according to your word just those words that's the one that conceived him and conceived her she conceived of the word are we together and then she bear a child of the how can you conceived of a we now isia conceived of the word the word was Spen was spoken to [Music] him there is God that has created you or that is God that has processed you now you must repent and recognize that God just by those words then you conceive you conceive the word of God now when we say we are waiting for the coming of the Lord coming for what what is he going to do to come and take his word that is in you are we together his word is in you you have conceived the word and that word has formed a person and that person is what you were before you become what you are before you becomes you the way are we together now God follows it and planted it in yourself in your heart and that germinate formed a man and that man is not the man of the world that is why he says those that you have given me they were [Applause] yours now he's coming to make them recognize that they are not of the world together so now I said uh uh John 6 did we read it okay fine let's read it it's 10 to now uh I think we are moving out here 8:00 now if you can read John 6 uh my brother let's read verse 39 John chapter 6:39 okay let's let's start from verse 36 up to 39 John chapter 6 verse 36 [Music] now listen what what he says here but I say unto you you you also have seen me and believe not it's like people that hear the word and believe it not to the Jews he came as Jesus they believed him not now what did he do he jumped over [Music] to when he came the first time it was not for theas the P the shans the Germans we he was not for the Gentiles only to the Jews when he sent his disciples will always says go to the house of Israel they rejected him then from there on crossed over to the and the Gentiles let me put it that way right but I say unto you that you also have seen me and believe not now to us he came as the we can I repeat that the word that is written in this Bible he came through it you read this word it it becomes very difficult for you to understand it but you go to the university you get a very big book written by fer you will read it and even graduate graduate but when you read this one you won't understand it you need a spirit that will guide you to understand that's where the mystery is because it's written by God himself through the inspiration now when you read it you read you need that inspiration that's why now then he continues and say all that the father have given me verse 37 shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will know CH so you go you you you become a believer of the word of God not because you want to no it's something that is in you otherwise if one can change change the hearts of people I can change you all if I had that power but it's God do that are we together even now I'm I'm preaching here but there are those that can hear me there are those that cannot hear me there are those that hear this man is saying the word of God there are those that say no we it's because come from different direction now very that's why in verse 37 says that the father given me shall shall come to me all that the father has given him shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will know why is cast out you hear what he says now verse 38 ver 38 for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me you hear what he says there's somebody that has sent him make me aware when the H has arrived is it okay oh sorry sorry sorry okay let me just wind up I've got about four minutes now he says for I come down from heaven not to do my own will the will of him that sent me the last verse says and this is the Father's will which yeah he has sent me that all which he had given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day so now what is happening is that now when somebody dies the spirit comes out goes back where it come from the soul go and wait somewhere else the body goes to the Grave so is the separation everything takes this direction the day you depart also your spirit will be taken and your soul will be taken out your body will buried now it depends on where does your spirit go you don't serve God it can't go to God and if your your soul was not occupied by the word of God it can go to God that's why now we have that's what we have what we call hell we we've got what we've got heaven got another dimension where the soul weighs we have this body here on Earth but when we die we wear another body but when we go to heaven it's another body we've got this terrestial body we've got when we come out of this one we wear a Celestial body and when we go to heaven we wear a glorified that is not just a saying thank you may the Lord bless you all may the family be comforted [Applause] that now he will rise another the spirit of him is in the hands of God but the soul is in the sixth Dimension and the body we are going to take it to the Grave one day that spirit will move from Heaven Come and collect the soul and come into this body he will res so that is your consolation sister Rebecca our brother you will still be with him together you'll be with him in the Millennium but you'll be Angels then are together may the Lord bless you can we bow our heads Mighty God Eternal Father your grace is sufficient for us we are consoled by Your Word nothing else Lord you loved us and you shed your blood at Mount Calvary that we should be alive you defeated death Lord you even went back we went deep down to Hell and wrestled with the devil and took the keys Lord and you came back and say I was dead now I am alive I've got the keys of death and Hell gracious Lord we fear nothing Lord here is the family father may you be with them Lord as we are in a process Lord to go to the graveyard just to bury the the remains of our brother knowing that one day brother father there will be a resurrection thank you Lord may you take control of all things Lord in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] Hallelujah and then one of [Music] [Music] Happ um direction we just go straight okay sister [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] by [Music] [Applause]
