last time [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen amen yes come into His presence you know I remember brother Brennan One Time Forest who do I say 13 then he saw an eagle and it was like working towards him then he says what and I cried like a baby you know these things we don't know but he has to listen to let us read the scriptures the pasta I can't call his name but uh foreign he brought me a gift I

which was bit of food had to continue all right so God bless you said really you made that service together with the people there a real service bless you for and before we read I will try to avoid uh praying buddy and foreign coming with already amen amen Heavenly Father one day the Apostle said there's a time where we are not going to say heavenly father our father was with us we pray my father for the word this is the man father daughter out of all the men because my father there are also men who are chosen but it is a man who's coming from you this man is standing here and the Lord is not him his mouth who always inside us father and you touching us inside ourselves foreign to 10. foreign body and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and Power which scripture is that repeat it brother for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead body which is the head of all principality and power yes yes sir you are complete Village Christ the Christ we are named after his name amen amen now we come to Melchizedek will come back to the boys under the same Christ now is you are completed him you may be seated see parents amen he is our constellation and you are complete amen in him you are completely we can close the service amen amen if you really can oh yeah see you are completely painless amen all right now I come with this part here Manchester the center of the Revelation is you know [Music] um I'm going to base these things on in this way because the prophet speaks of back to the first day um after you have run your servants and he resurrected on the hey they are defense day is it now here we have the book Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed last night it's a great subject is predestinated speak of the anointing foreign he because he is the anointed and his subjects are called Christians amen under that day anointing Japanese this book Christ is the mystery of language there is this part that says so it's Christ expressing himself to the individuals let this subject approach you again able to come not for your mommy not for your daddy not for your brother not for your sister but you see me is individuals should become the center where now amen is the day that it should be you and him I mean that day that is coming it's not you and your family or you and your friends okay it's you when you the individual there's this one part I don't know if ever I can come across it again one part says it's God in Mena that is manifestation I'm not talking about when preachers preaching the whole church is shouting hallelujah thank God I'm talking about you um foreign but we are talking about like it was Adam and God is then he would only address Adam White now it's God that is Page 64 of Christ is the mystery of God revealed maybe one day you will understand this the title itself epaper 64. um God don't look at you amen yes and brother brand name even said God don't look at me amen I think you have you've got it in your book or in your in your soul let's see because a book you can misplace you can't misplace yourself foreign I meant keep him the word says is related it's not just hearing access [Music] is God in men this this man let me hey I think we can spend the whole day have you ever seen God in amen amen from this and should you say yes I know of one um how is his conduct if you have seen God in that man um how he conducts himself because like he is coming now amen amen who are really Abba um the constellations and his coming is already in them as the prophet used to say potentially the Rapture is in you um amen because preaching the word is we you should be preaching what's in you amen all right amen now man here we are that's God in men that's his manifestation amen [Music] not that means manifestation amen you see when people look at you and your actions and how you talk how you act they should see something what is in you and he doesn't change amen Sunday to Sunday if you have found him this Sunday next Sunday yeah Asha do you want God in you as um would want God to be attentions [Music] oh no more um [Music] amen um you hear him singing a company amen now I I read this part let me come here again with something about a personal vindication foreign [Applause] foreign Abraham so he was Vindicated in Abraham okay amen foreign because to me music is not just sound um I mean I tried many times saying engineers amen you know it kills me where's somebody's just a song I've been listening to the songs [Music] go deeper foreign in trying to build that bridge certain level yeah foreign I've got a reason Guinness is hard it's a Sandy reason is it sad to figure um but there is this other man called amen you know the prophet says every Church must come up with a rock confession [Applause] you arrive at the Rock hangers you know the story I mean the readers Shabbat in his mind they were still a lord about a the The Rock Network before he started digging he had a rock before you start coming to the service that [Applause] by the time you will believe in the service got magnetized to that rock us I won't come to the service if to come to the service it were just to sing and again [Music] foreign the prophet tells us about that man who looked for the Revival when he met was it a postman or what is actually that meant to told him that emperor.com I am the Welsh Revival here in this service amen amen amen he said no you have arrived what is okay now let me say this again um his presence yeah with a personal a Vindication of himself now what did I say what we are here for to to talking about you just you you are the center yes um yeah I have been been tested by the word says found to be wealthy Saturday to bring a testimony maybe What if after this service I can say one let one stand up and testify not ask for prayers there's a time to ask for prayers just for asking for prayers it should be a testimony amen I was lost but now I am found again I was sick now I am healed amen amen amen let us hear more of the testimonies all right looking let me say this again you should look I have learned not to every time to complain to God um I have learned something for he says if you ask um believe that you alive amen amen so I have learned yeah to give more praises to Him they are than to ask amen because most of the things I'm asking for he has already given tomorrow result amen shall be added unto you amen they must be the first thing the first thing is now when you belong to that King that um amen because God in a kingdom you are yes okay amen hey it's something in the cheese seek ye first the kingdom of God um even and mentioned the things shall be given unto you because amen amen okay here we are I'm trying to say beauty before we close we are coming to that part of ours is he is yeah amen but if you believe God um in the book I think it's perfect faith and what team it says they live in What God Says amen wow what he is God says amen they live in what the word says amen okay no God believed in himself until he could just stand and say let there be light it was a god figure he believed in himself so positive yes [Music] God you should be positive because the Lord has spoken [Applause] it will just be like that watches he said amen oh you see we are born I looked at it in your book at the unveiling of God um you can say I want to preach the weight yeah it is a manifestation amen all right after he said let there be light in Vegas then he came back to say because now it's a manifestation use shine in the party is you shall work together with the water buffal OS [Music] [Music] you know he has according to the position of Christ and the bride actress know that service is going to be wonderful amen you must check first your chance then if even if you find the people Gathering praying or worshiping yes we must always make sure that is amen a sinner who comes in is himself the warmth of Salvation this is [Music] Christ and foreign [Applause] but because of the position that's why they were supposed to take their roots okay and what did happen to those Roses because God were in the holies amen now even if your number let me put it this way take everything and put it we back in the right place amen amen amen if you want your flower to germinate and Blossom and um put it in the ground amen put it in the right position [Music] hey I can go on and on and on some people sometimes because there are some people maybe a person you you pray for him in the morning these bodies are sick bodies yesterday I was with the brothers you know I was limping a bit but I was so determinedine that begin with cell I must arrive where we are going against I took control of the situation a brother said to me want you maybe rest here I said no no no no no if God is God Amen and coming back from that long walk I was just all right [Applause] amen so now Manchester always as I said sometimes I drove to Petersburg and I thought

amen amen now things started to roll over in my soul okay is Jesus amen sometimes I'm even afraid to think of it because I will something will start the will will start questioning Rolling In My Heart question is um I hope I believe there is that will in you yeah you know the angel has to start to Roar first there must be something in it is you are in your Realms who says the prophet says it means potentially amen well Elijah Elijah [Music] starting in Elijah he wouldn't have started The Chariot was in here [Music] before you come to the service the service should be in you then you can hold yourself because foreign I read it I I will take this part it's a totaling line really if you are where did I get this from this title from page 33 oh this is Christ the God does not look at you Christ amen amen from this sometimes men can think that question is that will put God in favor with him let me read to you again I can read this the whole week is okay but it depends if he says let there be light um then there was light if I read something here um then there will be a manifestation amen it's not something just to say I love that Scriptures it is just a word I can come here and
