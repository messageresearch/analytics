Description:
Title: The Rock Confession
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-November 12 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scripture:
Revelation 8:1

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the Rock Confession.

If you have hatred you are blind. The Pharisees and scribes couldn’t see God in action even when Jesus restored the ear of the young man after Peter chopped it off. Hatred has blinded the people to see the word when it is manifested.

Worshipping God is not about the style, but something that is in your heart. When we listen to music we don't listen to the style but the message.

When God send you a prophet, he send you an interpreter. For you to be here is because God interpreted the word to you and that is the calling.

When God calls you today it is through the word that was spoken. What you are is what you were.  When God says you are a Christian is because you can accommodate a holy nature, and when God says you are a sinner it is because you can accommodate a sinful nature.

The real message comes through the pyramid, and the white stone was within the pyramid. 

The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

62-1104M Blasphemous Names Par: 190-191 & 72
63-0324E  The Seventh Seal Par: 393 & 404
62-0318 The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed Par:195

seal has been opened to us amen amen now meaning that it is not just opened but it's open to somebody all right amen and we see it that's the six all right amen if we see it what it is the six is open and we see it what do we see okay the answer is one we see Moses and El all right when that se was opened amen amen but the seven then he said this one special amen and even today will he will tell us whether this one is was also revealed or not okay that one because it's Moses and Elijah it's easy to say Moses an Elijah right but I think in the time of Moses and Elijah am also will not see it at the time amen all right amen is open now we going to ask what are we see let us turn to our Bibles H for now I will read the same chapter of the eth Revelation chter 8 chter 8 verse one brother chapter 8 verse one God bless you and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let's B I also want to thank God before I start praying that uh there was some I saw something okay upon the roof of my house then I wanted to know what is that so i ph brother and said H let's get into the what is that call center and I see what what's happening on the roof was it yesterday brother yes and then we saw God showed us so we know the people we know them by names on my roof it was something to do with my study [Music] room amen amen now this is the God we we are here for to and I told the brothers when we were coming from uh where we went for a dedicational service I said you know my house I haven't yet tasted dedicated the house we were so much concerned with dedication of the [Music] otheres and forgot all about my now we I'm going to dedicate itate I'll take the brothers with me and there's a young man here and I don't know if I told the the father that we should dedicate his house because we have already received amen amen now that's why I'm here to worship the who tell us all things who shows us what the devil is doing but because we don't fear Satan and we don't fear what Satan can do that's we don't talk too much against the people and so for but we allow them to talk and talk and talk to talk but let us worship God the [Music] son they say remain with me remain with me the sun has gone as we are opening here say to Your Heart Lord like I need you the [Music] most with me the world is in flat as it was days of

pastor may you come down and talk to us and talk to our [Music] hearts amen amen God bless you as you take your [Applause] seats amen uh I don't know if you have seen this part but we are coming with brother uh our brother for the ending of the seven SE and the opening of the new day I think this was given to me yesterday now we are coming but today let's follow here I'm going to read from this part um there was Junior Jackson's dream Junior and the prophet say junior Jackson junior the Lord let me he says Jackson dream the Lord let me interpret amen amen now we it it ended up with some Visions this a a Ministry a vision can be seen of a certain class of people and uh and become so real because when God wants to say something to somebody not the public he comes with a vision to that somebody or this people when he wants to talk to somebody alone amen so that the other one would not hear all right because you can't preach a thing that you don't understand and know but then if God wants a certain class to hear a so he has chosen a class because you he must make sure it is the class that can be able to keep the secret amen amen if there's something you want to uh bring a secret you want to talk secret to some and they want the people to keep it you see Samson H who was that girl de Delila I think think many have got delas in their cell phones now Samson I'm talking about these young people not not all the young people but those who have Del line there amen amen I now the Philistines Phil and this woman she thought that the power was the logs then you know they captured Samson because you was now they thought the power is not knowing that the hair was the power was not in the head but in the heart so he revealed that to the woman the one who was not supposed to know the secret and it ca Samson amen amen okay the power was where where the secret was where in the heart not in the head that's why he ended up bringing the whole building down because they were there in that talking about it he had power but now our sister and his done as a very good job power he's no power now but the secret was there in [Music] the the hidden power all right amen even now the enemy was dealing thought they were dealing with Samson but God had to protect what he has put in Sam don't worry the people think they are fighting you no they are fighting God who is in you that's why the Bible say you pray even for your enemy when your enemy is hungry God says feed even your enemy you know people are talking about us but I'm not teaching taking it upon myself the Lord Jesus Christ when they were calling him names and calling him King of the Demons the Lord Jesus Christ then I asked myself who am I if the very the Creator was called by name they said he's a c who am I and he kept quiet what a mighty God we say the God who could have caused them to vanish in a twinkl but he said forgive them Father they don't know what they do you must learn to forgive the people who don't know what they do now let's read let's start here I'm looking at the clock here we we'll continue yes amen I hear they talking about the conference yes we will follow him we don't know that's why C time is so short and the devil don't want us to talk about it the days of Noah are here with us and only few people can see that people don't see what time no they are looking for ref future the world almost the whole world is flooded do the people see that no they don't see what is [Music] happening uh even during the night I can wake up just to check the time we are living in but what keeps me full of joy is that there's something in me that that says expect the rupture any now that's why the real bride of [Music] Christ she is rapturing amen amen it's just a matter of time when we shall all right amen but today let's look at this we have seen how H God has taken us from this to that and we are going now to take this part only for now then we'll continue last we have read something here from future home page 27 home 27 where are you going after you hit seven amen amen you know the bread have got this Runway and uh how it started uh the prophet of God says you know when when the Lord Jesus Christ I had brother I think is G he he he talked about that when the Lord Jesus Christ when he died and uh he was buried actually the body was buried because they couldn't bury God the body was killed they couldn't kill God but when he was in the uh grave or what you call he told them already on the third day destroy this Tabernacle he was referring to the body on the third day I will raise it up he didn't say mention he didn't refer to somebody to raise the body now because they didn't know the language of God hey this man we're going to kill this man but he says he will raise the they didn't understand that they could stop at the time but but let us listen to this you know when they came with torches and what and when he said as they [Music] said who are you amen amen you know he dropped them down with one sentence when he said I am but at that time they didn't they were blinded you know a blind person instead of coming together and say have you seen what has happened even when after Peter he chopped the ear he took it from the the Lord Jesus Christ and just plucked it but still they [Applause] were that's why the Bible says they were [Music] blind because they couldn't see God In Action picking up an the ear of the young man just to plug it saying I'm the Creator I created this man amen amen and this I I'm responsible for this year so I put it back again they were just still watching with hellish hate because hatred makes you blind if you have hat you are blind because because hatred blinded their eyes they could not they could not even see that this man just picked up an ear and put it back amen blindness B the prophet are when the prophet say sons of God will be God what I now you put it in the future then what about the sons of God are a God not they shall be a God Amen now what blinds you we can preach here about wonderful things of God but if you seen that hatred can see that hatred has blinded the people to see the word being manifested there was one day uh some brothers were asked a question uh Brothers this man certain men is this man not having a child with another woman outside he's God and that this qualified him disqualified to become to minister in the church even that case was not at why when they ask them don't you know the cabinet of that man they said why is it coming with hatred blinded can blind you and you'll do things against God against the word of God trying to show another person that you will not listen to him hatred it blinded the eyes of the people they couldn't see that God in action putting back hey hatred let's read now we are going to follow this now things have changed and uh he keeps on change yeah sing unto us this song [Music] I'm I'm glad to have you brothers and sisters in the Lord amen and songs a song is what yeah remember let's leave him like a song H to sing actually a song is a message that's why because of people are stylish there one healing he can hear that no that's not my style so message he can hear or listen to the message he's only looking for worshiping God as a style is not about style it's something in your heart you get what I mean that's why brother even if you don't want noise you don't like noise don't go to heaven if you don't like noise there's people that follow things according to style and there when you sing and [Music] say just say it wonderful just car [Music] one [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen sing us this songs wonderful amen amen our representative the one who died for us let me read and close the service it's page 575 575 uh he speaks about the third we will come and explain the thir the thir came from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed they picked me up that was coming back east because men was placed what was there you were to go Westward what was in the west man was placed Eastward and when men would go W what was there now that's why uh just like it said in junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret for you know if God sends you a prophet he sends you an interpreter God has spoken but for you to come around and you are here it is because God has interpreted the word it is the word you were made of but the calling it's when that word is interpreted to you is then you said is talking to me I must be baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll see even if there's somebody here to whom God interpreted his word after this service he will come forth and be it's according to the to what God has interpreted all right amen and it says [Music] uh yeah amen Junior Jackson junior Jackson came to the prophet with a [Music] dream and then the prophet interpreted that dream to Junior Jackson because Junior Jackson junior Jackson if he was just a junior Jackson Juni he could actually go to say hey I dreamed but because it was from God we to God's Prophet then he continue uh the Lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone we'll come and see why this ministry is all about p there's a reason why let me not start we'll come next time if there will be next time the Bible says don't say tomorrow do this say if you know this days I'm so careful because Rapture can come any time I read now he says there was white stone that wasn't written on you know in that pyramid that's the reason I had to go west to connect all right now I think you'll understand where we are you know uh every time we went to church we expected to hear the minister say and adulter they will not enter but now I am talking to the bride now so you can't say to the bride and and saying adulterers and drunk cannot enter now let me talk to the yeah he was talking to the bride that's the reason I had to go west to connect with this Angel's message to come back here to it to the church we are going still going to say things you are going to see if you haven't seen it you will see God giving a book to the messenger for the messenger to uh reveal this seventh angel message to reveal it to the bride amen okay Amen to reveal if I say reveal what am I talking about what am I saying if somebody tell tells you go and reveal to reveal is that you are going to a specific [Music] person who is in that position that when you come you are a prophet you've got the word sent to that you are going to the right person because he was there before the foundation of the world but as we were sealed before the foundation of the world and we come through and the what the the RO call if God calls you today it is through a word that was spoken there was something here in the book I don't know if I can find it but by Grace I can okay oh I don't find my page here uh if has somebody the spoken what is the original seat nearby if not don't worry I can quote it to you but if you got the book happy to have it the spoken it is there is the original s all right if you don't have it don't wor all right brother amen bless you siren uh I believe it will correspond amen all right don't worry we are here uh I'm let me read something here and every one of the other Sons will have the same manifestation because we are not living in those days we are living in these [Music] days and there's the word from God these days all right amen and that's the ones that was predestinated uh and that's the ones uh predestinated listen and everyone of the other Sons will have the same manifest that's why we are here having the same manifestation I believe what you believe and that's the ones that was predestinated because if I come with the way to you from the position of predestination the were the message when it reach the time it reach to you it will just manifest because it comes to a predestinated seed amen amen amen you you see the word of God brother bam says we were not made a seat amen I I want to put the way he puts it yeah he you are born [Music] again because you are a seed for you to have a field of wheat what must you do plant amen amen and now that seed uh to next time you plant that seed again it still comes as wheat you don't pray for a certain seed to become you don't fast pray and do this and that to change a seed in order to become a kind of SE no that's why there's some Revelation Seasons at a certain time God comes and plans that very same seed and next year he will take from that seed again amen and until it becomes ages that's why today we have ared at the seven but what you are it's what you [Applause] wear only that it comes ACC you know season of change did you hear in was it cap town or Elizabeth season of CH Seasons it's long time I don't hear that song the brother hasard me uh that little group every generation will come up in the resurrection amen meaning that every time at that season that very same SE now we are up here to manifest the season and that's why he says you are a seed in order to be born again hey did you hear that you say change you know this season for change from season That season to this season you are still the same seed but in another I was there you were there but today you are in another season brother says when Paul preached he was also there that's why he says I preach what Paul has now if you were there if you are here you will hear because when Paul preached you were in the church only that it comes by Seasons if this season was supposed to come to the end and comes another se you will still appear there right amen I hear many don't believe it you will come up in the resurrection even there were million Resurrection you would reappear now that's why I'm reading this part now he says uh actually one part I was looking for is that he says the word that God spoke did not find a place because you as I'm closing you are a place amen either you are a place of good or a place of evil but you are a place if they say God says you are a sinner it is because you can accommodate sinful nature amen then God says you are a sinner if God says you are a Christian it is because you can accommodate holy the holy nature no matter what the other people do you are not taken at all but by the wicked way or for someone you are a seed and every time when planted you will still remain that's why you are not you don't get baptized because mama got baptized [Music] but what I was coming to was the prophet says the word that God spoke did not find a place until it found a place in Mary that's a seed keep amen okay amen now that's why this we are going to read about things we are going to read about a thing that found a place in [Music] you uh do you accept it or [Music] not okay amen let me read where am I I end up with this on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone that was in oral we will follow that sto because why we are so interested the stone was on the inside of the pyramid you know why did you realize that the message that we preach is about pyramid pyramid pyramid pyramid pyramid why because Blasphemous names names says then Enoch page 10 Enoch completed in his day back in that day the pyramid that is the seventh man now you watch every seventh man you watch every seventh congregation because God made one thing the pyramid and we don't have another type of a pyramid everything that would come from God it will be found in the pyramid but one pyramid we talking about of which we are going to see the Pyramid of angels of a CL now we are beyond the church ages that's why I don't think will sit the whole night trying to find to preach to you about smoking amen do you smoke all right finishing here oh yeah yeah yeah the pyramid pyramid and uh uh cuz we haven't got time all right let me leave that it h it it show show how that the pyramid come up through the chambers it speaks right straight to the end time age now is now you realize that the real message comes through the pyramid pyramid amen even the white stone was in the pyramid showing that if you want to see the Church of God come to the pyramid because it comes through the pyramid the sign is the pyramid we are coming back to the angels here all right amen but it says the pyramid come up through the chambers and so forth it speaks right straight to the [Music] end this will show you why we always talk about the pyramid we even have arrived at the Pyramid of angels speaks to that there in the king's chamber by the measurements but the headstone never was put on the pyramid and to the people who are not in the pyramid they would never never know where about The Headstone because I'm coming to read to you that the head stone whether the pyramid was kept by the seven THS according to the word of the Prophet it is kept you know something that is kept is that when you look up you see the C you'll see that in the spoken the mid came a person now a person who is in the pyramid through the chambers and we have the white stone but we will come to the stone and the interpretation that brother says is a flying interpretation what does that mean because he's talking about interpretation of an angel that was flying Brothers now I must close here oh you know when the thing was getting to the top of but pray for me also the devil don't like you and he doesn't like me but God loves us amen the love of Jesus so wonderful the love of Jesus all right just we stand up let us sing like soldiers so wonderful oh wonderful love the love of Jesus is so wonderful the love of Jesus so wonderful the love of Jesus is so wonderful oh Wonder full is so high is so high you

you can't get around it oh wonderful amen amen [Applause] yes uh you know I will make some sure that you you remain closer to to your your place hereen so that when we start to sing you don't have to
