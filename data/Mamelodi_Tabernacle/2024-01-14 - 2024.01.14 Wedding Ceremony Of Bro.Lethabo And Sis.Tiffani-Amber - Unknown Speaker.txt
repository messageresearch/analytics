should be as he has deed to behold all I will sent you El the [Music] prophet that praise [Music] and [Music] and heart of their father to their children the of the children to I [Music] God [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ho Lord Holy [Music] Ghost all [Music] right you may be seated for a while as I greet you all this afternoon in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so you know uh not puzzled but I am [Music] blessed I didn't expect such a big what's let me not say is it Crow or I would say crown yeah so God bless you for your support I was trying to stop one unmarried brother because I knew that he was just leaving for uh to a place where they FR meet him so then I tried to say brother brother there's a wedding here yeah I just said amen I'm waiting for him the day he tells me that he's getting married God bless you Saints may the Lord bless you I really have never expected such a big crowd since it is afternoon I thought it would be something hectic for you to come and remain here this is what God is going to do for you and your children amen okay so it's a a wedding um you know there was one I think in England or [Music] somewhere call it they called it Royal and uh it was published World okay not saying anything against that but I believe when uh it's a marriage of children of [Music] God amen amen it's more than anything you think of we have young people unmarried here some of them after the service they were at the parking where are they are married and I agree with the prophet when he says men should marry young [Music] because you know now if the time for a young man has passed now he being a boss in the family you understand he become bossy and chasing around his sisters and so for until one of the [Music] sister okay so let us do things according to Time young man what are you waiting for can you answer what are you waiting for mm I heard one young man bragging saying I'm 22 years old I said ah you have passed you are over amen go back and get married go back all right God bless you we are so glad we wanton take more time and necessarily yes sir but we want to make this something uh to remain in your heart if you are not happy today you won't be happy even tomorrow I'm going to read just a scripture I think we introduce everything this morning right now is just straight to the word where is brother no uh the brother was corus leading you say call it corus leading or what oh you yeah you yeah didn't know you are Al you also can lead very well you too okay we see you how do you rate them brother okay so you'll play for them even at the end of this I think they two will come and sing something together all right okay brothers and sisters as I promised and but you know I can't preach long for a long time you know no man can preach for a long time you can just preach the word of God for the time that God has given now here I'm not here to preach we are going to celebrate together um marriage is a wonderful thing [Music] if it is blessed by God marriage is a wonderful thing in the Lord you know without [Music] God somebody getting married is already thinking about him because he has a lawyer lawyer the lawyer is means that if things go higher away he forms his [Music] lawyer but do we the children of God when we marry we don't need a lawyer we need Jesus I'm going to read the scripture now and then I won't be long by God's grace amen amen and I think this marriage my intention is that after this one then we are going to have some young people coming to get married oh well others are not leing but what's in person's heart amen but with me I'm looking forward to this young people getting married amen and this young women here teing marriage because all things we find in the Lord now if we have found God that means we have have found marriage let me see young men send up young men and marriage yeah how are you Brother's [Music] [Music] Day [Music] amen I will ask somebody to take photos of all you [Music] brothers that oh God bless you the brother the has already done that they are already in so I will check you time and again amen God bless you all right now I'm looking at the scripture and then uh maybe you'll wonder say the pastor is only looking at the young men what about young women no they were born waiting for [Music] Day now come young men and get married one was asking me about the rupture they concerned with the rupture saying now we that are not married are we also going in the Rapture yes amen amen now I see he's trying to do things quickly the best thing is for you to do it prayerfully don't try to do things in order to overrun the Rapture God bless you I'm going to read a scripture and I promise you I won't be long but thanks for the parents of the uh name is R family and uh God is going to bless them uh their child is my child will look after their children very well let's stand up okay it's not a preaching say no he just for I'm looking for a brother he has arranged for me a scripture here and uh uh I'm going to read that scripture and let's bow our heads we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to one how wonderful you are amen Lord this afternoon amen yesterday night I was just studing the word of God and there was something in my heart amen that came like a flood and it took away all the things I was thinking of amen and I remain thinking only about Jesus am and I there was something deep in my soul saying this Jesus I believe one day that day is coming I don't know but but in my heart there's something deeply rooted in my heart about Jesus whom I will see with my own eyes that's why the Lord is changing ohy as even our seeing is changing because very very soon we're going to meet the king it keeps me awake all the [Music] time I have gone past the things of this world I've got no future in this world there's no future for me in this world Amen that's why what's in me amen is Just to See Jesus sometimes I share with John the Baptist amen this Eagle was on the banks of the River Jordan waiting for to introduce Jesus I don't know what's in the of the people but to me this Jesus is real sry that I'm I just want to see him and touch me touch him hold him by but I know that is coming I know it would be long that I will meet him since we met when we were in his mind even before the foundation of the world this wonderful Jesus and I remember one of these days I was just reading when John stood there by the river of Jordan amen just to introduce him Amen to the people and he said behold the Lamb of God lord here is the wedding today pray for this wedding that you'll bless this brother and sister and the others to follow you'll bless their parents I pray in Jesus Christ name all things are possible in Christ amen and I will say amen and amen amen as we open the scripture uh First Corinthians chapter 11 but here it says verse 9 I mean it says uh verse 9 verse chapter 11 verse 9 chapter 11:9 that's the scripture shall we read that scripture neither was a man created for the woman but the woman for the men amen carry on verse 10 for this cause all the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God okay amen amen praise the Lord let's look at the scriptures wonderful day of the Lord marriage and for a brother and a sister now I read here uh that is the scripture Corinthians chapter 11 verse 99 let me read this scripture quickly H neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the men sorry continue for this [Music] cause or the woman to have power on her head you know because of the Angels it didn't say h it says power while the teaching is that of speaks of her hair now today is wedding we go to that power the hair you know if we look look at the Nazar s amen amen and uh the the neither was neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the men that is the scripture then so will start here there's also a another scripture Matthew 19 and we going to run it uh 19:3 to6 Matthew 19:3 to6 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall give to his wife and they turn shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more tne but one flesh what therefore God have joined together let no man put us under amen amen so before I call them H to come yes another scripture amen amen who has created for the the woman was created for man then you are blessed man brother you are blessed created wife specially speci you know the brothers were buying a car but they come like this it's not just what you Dash into the garage and say I want this no they ask you sit down they ask you questions first uh what type of a you and then then you start it there saying it should be this with this what must be connected to it and they writing down that is the kind of car you are looking for amen amen but in God he doesn't come and say brother what type of of wife do you want no it says it's ready made yes you know if it were like to be like buying a and God says what kind of your wife when will say You Know M must be educated now you can see dangerous I want an educated one and uh with a complexion should be young and you know yeah and should not go round and what now God don't work things God knows you then after that he creates for [Applause] you you don't tell him that I want this feed to my wife I want like with the car you will say I want you to fit what what what what these things of today what you call GPS GPS yeah GPS my car this and this but with God he think for you because God knows you better than you think you know yourself why why he has created you so he knows you better all right amen you need not to tell him Lord I want this type of a woman educated one we've God you don't do that no read it again who has created for whom amen neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the men amen hey what a gift are you there am it's a gift if men can create uh a car car is actually not created what do you say about the car it's is yeah there's only one Creator is God all right amen so that means the wife God looks at you and creat created her for you amen that's why the prophet says if it happens that she's not the right one then don't worry you are still going to find the right one because the one there one created for you that is that's the word of God and if there's one created for you as the the song says they that wait upon the Lord sometimes we miss it because we don't wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up like wings so let me then finish here now Matthews I'll finish with Matthew uh 19 Matthew 19 where my time 19 yes verse three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting you know what it means tempting saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause amen amen we know that is tempting and he answered because they asked God amen amen they thought he's a lawyer or so for they missed it they were not supposed to ask him such a question and he answered and said have you read that which he which made them when at the beginning there is no second hand here he who made at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother maybe today you'll understand this men came without father and mother who is the mother of Adam no mother you know I thought I'm talking to you like I'm talking to an officer let me ask a question who was the mother of AD and the father of yeah the powerful one is coming from here God bless you so he was created he was not born Adam was not born but was that's go that was God's promise to create amen right amen we were not supposed to be born we just supposed to be created because the Bible says he created men in his own amen with birth could be a different things every person parent if she's a good or he's a good Christian he will always say oh if God could give me a child like me like men men uh if he is a good man he will always think of [Music] this uh if God can bless me with a woman like me all right although there's different things here one is wife one is a [Music] woman that's why what you need as a young man is a wife not a woman because a wife is a creation that God has prepared that's a called that's why they said where is your wife they never said where is your woman all right let me close because I'm end up teaching now men shall live did did it say girlfriend that's why they getting married today so they so that they won't go along as boyfriend and girlfriend they've done a very good thing by getting married today all right amen his sister H sister she comes in after yes all right is she around but let me feelish sure that she can come and sing that song Amen and at home I have your song songs a place was prepared for me I enjoyed them very well I intend I'm looking around for some other songs for to sing let us finish then okay here's the answer and it will be over have you not read that he which made them he never spoke of their teacher no but he who made them you want to know any person go to him who has made that person then you found the right person God bless this marriage now let me just finish up now he answered them the question is the Pharisees also came tempting him you know tempting him not really wanting the truth Orting saying is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause but here the answer he said unto shall I read it again verse four four and he answered have you know it is in the scriptures go to the scriptures the scripture will tell you that he which made them at when at the beginning made them male and female and said for this CA shall a man live father and mother he didn't say ditch them no because now he is also becoming a father now going to be a father amen amen and shall C to his wife and the two shall be one [Music] flesh wherefore they are no more T but one flesh wherefore H what therefore God has joined together not some not a a wish doctor Trad yeah tradition yeah they say we should not say they called me what did they say in the radio in the yeah okay well I didn't bother to go to to the government they are breaking the law call witch and and then you said one must not call another a witch but because I'm a Child of God Amen I don't go to and TR them just leave them in the hands of and said for this CA which cause which cause at the beginning made them M and female now for this cause and said for this shall a man leave father and mother and shall cff to his wife and they turn shall be one flesh let us finish by saying wherefore they are no moreen but one flesh amen let me not get into that because yeah is just a wedding what therefore God has joined together let no man put us under okay a man and woman were quaring and the woman say even if you can say the Bible says God has brought us together and we are one say if you were one you would not be doing what you doing no matter what we are one okay amen but now we are talking about the children of God now by so doing if then it is God they will remain one Amen brother Bram that's that's why I read the spoken word because to me it's not a cult is the word of God I'm preparing for something uh where a Jewish spoke about brother have you seen [Music] that compared with many of you compar the dollar to the rent I don't look at that atend what is happening here at the end time where is the word of God I don't care about bu dollar being what because the love of money is the root of all evil that's why people have lost their souls for rituals amen I'm done the two and the Bible says if God put them together no man should put them as amen that's why we are here now to marry our brother and our sister and to look to God for continuity of their marriage amen amen and by so doing they will continue with their work in the Lorden and then as even Pastor edar edar he looking for the brother
