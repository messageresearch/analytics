Description:
Title: The things that happened before the foundation of the world.
Preached By Elder Neo Makgareetsa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 14 July 2024.

The Elder read the following scriptures:
Matthew 13:35,2-3,13,24,31,34; Matthew 25:34;Romans 9:11-15; Hebrews 4:3; Revelation 13:8; Ephesians 1:4,9-11;John 13:3

The purpose of the sermon was to show the people about the things that happened before the foundation of the world.

The Word is one but we do not understand it the same. When you come to church you must pray for God to reveal the Word to you. When you come to church with negativity you will go back with negativity. 

The Word of God needs your heart not your mind or your understanding. When people don’t understand they leave. You must  wait for God to reveal it at the right time. When God is in you, you no longer have questions, you have answers.

Looking at things through the eyes of the World and looking through the eyes of God, they will always contradict. God does things in a different way. 

Everything that God is doing, they were done before the foundation of the world. Just be a good follower and there is a benefit into that, at the end you will be a beneficiary of being a good follower. 

God has already fought for us in heaven, He come to save the Savable , and He come to redeem the redeemable. God has visited you, hence we are where we are today.The more you question the Word of God , it is the end of you. 
God respect the soul that respects Him. 
There is time for claiming and time for praying. 
You get the Holy Ghost when God decide to give it to you, because He gives you Himself. 
God chose us to finish this race, that means we are the trusted ones. 
When it comes to the things of God, you must wait upon God. The only best thing we can do at this time is not to look at the left or right but is look to God, because when you look to God you are save. 

The Elder quoted the following spoken words:
64-0802- The Future Home Of The Heavenly Bridegroom ...

we will continue with the word of God amen amen so without wasting time we will read from the scriptures and continue amen if you can open in the book of St Matthew 13: brother will pray for us before we read amen amen let us pray gracious Lord Almighty once again father we approach your throne of Mercy at this point in time Heavenly Father we have sang we have prepared our hearts we have prayed but this time father we approach this moment knowing father that this is a time where you descend and Heavenly Father hide behind the skin of a brother that we know very well well but there's one thing father that we are never used to it is that presence heavenly father when it has fully taken a b of aen heavenly father we can always say indeed God has spoken so let it be again today heavenly father that you'll really Lord Almighty open our inner eyes to see behind the veil of Flesh heavenly father and you'll just circumcise our ears so that we can hear heavenly father with our theophanies Heavenly Father we commit the speaker we commit our brother this morning before you oh God that you just use him heavenly father as we have heard even throughout the days that when the truly anointed servants are speaking that is the voice of God Amen Let It Be this morning once again father that every one of us when we leave this place we shall say God has spoken to us those who are are sick they will leave this place held heavenly father as we commit the service into your hands in Jesus name amen amen please read Matthew 13 verse 35 amen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world amen amen you may be seated uh we don't okay others have read from their Bibles so we will continue with the word of God this morning and we thank God for everything amen amen so the message for this morning we will talk about the things just just what happened before the foundation the world subtitle will be fighting from Victory amen amen the word of God on it own it's [Applause] Unique there are things that happened there are things that are happening and there are things that Willen happen as long as we are still in this body but God undertake all amen amen so we we read here looking at what Jesus was doing in his time well I'm going to read chap verse two of the same chapter it says and great multitude were gathering together unto him so that he went into the sheep and said and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in Parable saying behold asour went forth to sow amen amen so when you look at this Jesus was preaching to the multitude and deliberately with Parables and then as as time goes by you read verse 24 it says another Parable amen amen and then about the Kingdom of Heaven it was another Parable when you read verse 31 it say another parable you read verse 33 another Parable so he was preaching about The Parables and The Parables and The Parables because there were too many it says multitude you know when you have many people you have many problems because they don't think the same and they will never understand the same am amen amen you know this morning I may stand here after the service talk different [Applause] things that is why there will be always contradic because the word is one but we don't understand it the same so Jesus was trying to eliminate the number get to the number that when he speak understand as I was saying the other day one Minister was preaching about Seven Seals and then after the service the church was so happy and then forgetting Revelation then forgetting the Revelation no no whoit after after people were saying they have received the Revelation amen all right so the Revelation was oh when you were preaching we have seen the power of God revealing unto us are not s there 4 the minister was so disappointed because it's not what he when they open when the SE open dou itself then they started to see he was in the church and the other one from the same church this one that's that's what we experience on a daily basis to misinterpret what the preacher is saying you know what causes that when you come to church you must pray for God to reveal the come with negativity negative come to church stay in the church negativity go home neity you will see 14 that's what causes that problem trying to open the channel this morning that sometimes just be a good listener and listen to the weight to flow in you without imagining when the preacher preach and say he's talking about me you're going to miss the whole amen amen it's not easy to be a preacher people will misinterpret you and make conclusion on what you saying finding that is a wrong thing now Jesus here had the same experience he said to the people I preach in parables in Parables you know when I preach about something you do not understand you live and when I continue others leave and when I continue the number is at minimum then I started to talk what I wanted to talk about you will grab it it's natural that is why start school at grade A until grade 12 when you look back only see maybe two or three the one that started with you from the rest just fall off on that's why you have people that left school earlier say x * X is X then the next class they say prove it you fail to prove it you leave school because it's like if I fail here what more about 12 what more about University it's what is happening in life what is happening in the church when the people do not understand they leave let God make you understand not un your own understand the word of God needs your heart your mind with you now here the Bible says I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world I want you to understand that line because it's my key word keep secret from the foundation of the world that means from the foundation of the world a secret was kept even the angels do not know because it's with God then God at the right time will give it to the people whom he love not multitude but that minimum number that God has amen amen I've got few scriptures to read today and few quot from the prophet you to understand what I'm talking about because we need to fight from there if you can fight from there won't go wrong amen amen let's read another scripture that I want you to keep the key we Matthew 25 25 ver 34 Verse 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen amen from the foundation of the world were happening first of all he kept a secret second he prepared a kingom those things he prepared them before there was anything but he kept them within himself a secret was kept a kingdom was prepared then all those things at the right time will be unveiled unto you this what brother is saying so this morning I'm just going to read those few scriptures so your understanding let's read another scripture in Romans chapter 9 chter 9 we will read from verse 11 until verse 16 Romans chapter 9 from verse 11 to 16 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but alsoo have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said unto to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that will live nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy amen amen you see how God does things the children were born then he he do good to this one evil to this one because it's the election of God and this election before the children were born it was done before the foundation of the world so God is preparing his things at the right time we will just unveil and manifest and let the people know at the right time our God is a good planner he does not do things oppos now my key word here is the election of children before there was ever this world it was done there if you can fight from there you will never go wrong amen amen from where God elected you from where the kingdom was prepared for you where God kept all those secrets and they shall be known unto you amen amen when you look at things with the eyes of the world you will always mess up I was somewhere preaching then I was preaching about Abraham when he said to Sarah tell the people that we are brothers and you are my sister then we continue like that then they continue like that King mik when God come things were different look at the thing to high court to start with Abraham was wrong for telling the people that Abra Sarah is not his wife but look at the high court of Heaven condescended here to AB said to him it's my prophet's [Applause] wife looking at things through the eyes of the world and looking at things Through The Eyes Of Heaven they always contradict and then God said to you know AB you go to that man take his wife back to him even apologize and let him pray for you then he shall be blessed looking at the eyes of the World unfair how can I do wrong even apologize amen amen God do things differently and the way in his people way they were even punished by God they were sick they were baren but after he went to Abraham Abraham blessed him and pray for him things came back to noral God will always do things differently amen amen now here you will ask yourself a question again through the eyes of the world that here is Esau and Jacob but Jacob life not like the way supposed to be God said I love Jacob because I hate is Through The Eyes of the world so unfair but Through The Eyes Of God it's fair do you know the reason behind this is looking at you of what he see before him the Bible says the young one you real you behold the face of the father if you are face be hold the face of the father no matter what is happening world you are God God is looking at that brother says you redeemed soul is what makes everything like the way they are so when God was looking at the soul of Esau is not beholding his face but Jacob behold the face of the father irrespective of the condition God will protect Jacob even change his name to Israel amen amen it was always like that let's read another scripture then you will I will go to the Cotes God is doing things differ let's go to um Hebrews 4:3 Hebrews 4:3 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sown in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world I just wanted to show you this you see I'm reading the Bible always these things were done before the F Of The World God kept them and it settled everything for you to fight the devil you must know yourself you must know your position the foundation of the world if you don't see yourself there your effort will never help I'm just trying to to help you again that my key words here is the work was finished before the foundation of Amen so everything was it's like a package that has contained everything inside and you have them not sharing with anyone but waiting for the right time start unfolding and sharing to the people so everything that God is doing done before the found you read Ephesians chapter 1 we can read we are at church then I'll show you the code later verse four to 5 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself amen amen ACC according as he has chosen before the foundation of the world he chose us he predestinated us so my key words there he chosen us and predestinated us [Applause] if you can see yourself from that point you will never have problems we have problem in this world because we want to put our own thinking word of God I sometimes tell the people there just be a good follower you just full and the next thing you do following and that's it there's a benefit of [Applause] following you know we haven't done anything good to but he chose us before the foundation of the best thing we can do because he chose us we must just follow him [Applause] [Music] amen all our efforts should just be finished just follow the people don't want to follow they want position and they fight for the position know in the world motivational speakers will tell you that for you to be successful and after fighting I met this friend of mine he's a very successful man in mining then we were talking about business the other day he said to me in business you don't smile if it's need to kill then I said said no no no not literally I mean to to tend the tender killing I'm talking about but to my surprise yeah he no longer phing me because he knew he literally killed that's a motivation of the motivators from the world there in the word of God you don't fight you just follow I'm telling you the motivation I can give you this morning be a good follower a good follower at end of your journey along the line you be the beneficiary of following the the motivational speaker of the world they will mislead you because others that are successful their success they did not get it good they killed literally to get what they had that's why they don't sleep at night because they are ghosted because when the after whis when you are sleeping Dre meditating and so forth so God has made us like that when I see fighting from Victory you fight because he fought for you because he has won the war as the Bible says there was a war in heaven and we were on the side of M was fighting we were just good follower when fight lufer let's be good followers today amen amen the work was complete if the work is complete what's your effort going to do no effort because the work was complet let's read verse 9 Ephesians 1:9 to 11 11 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself wait amen you hear what God is saying here I'm just trying to make you relax heav made us known made known unto us the mystery agree in in this world we are living in we have intelligence people that can read the spoken word preach for two hours minutes intelligence yes and anal it and get it wrong you you we do not need that intelligence that you get you get 95% of mathematics in the class we need to relax in the W and made us known he must visit us and made this mystery known no effort you just relax in the way when you are relaxing in the way he wakes you up I have this [Applause] in not by praying harder not by fasting not by coming to church but in your relaxation he just give you and your question will be what have I done for you to give me this for me to call a son and a daughter of the respond haven't done anything good I just LED [Applause] you amen amen happen during that time of Peter and Paul and then we had lawyers we had doctors we had businessmen we've got accountants we've got you know text people and so forth but God decided to give his secret to Peter and he give it to Peter and said Peter I give you the keys of heaven if the accountant does not want to enter there it's up to him but I give you the keys if the physician do not want to enter there but I give you the keys I'm trying to show you this in the word of God is not about what we know from it's about what we know from inside because that is the place God chose Hallelujah am amen amen I read you previously saying mes was the Christ of his day for you to survive you must go to Moses if you're not going to Moses you know questioning his credentials you miss it the first thing they look at Peter University you attended after realizing he was just a fisherman the number come to minimum and God Did It deliberately because he saved you because you were saved to begin with Christ Jesus when he come he come to save the savable he came to redeem the redeemable when he died on the cross for [Applause] everybody we can preach it in the churches that he died on the cross for us not everybody people I hope you understand but God forbid we all all get there amen amen you see that's how were going I'm going to finish my scriptures and read the code now First Peter 1 verse 18 to 20 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 18 to 20 for as much as he know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by a tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamp without blemish and without spot who verely was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in this last time for you amen amen my key word there from verse for ordained before the foundation of the world and he manifest those things in this last time in this last time let's let's read it who very was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in this last time for you amen amen for you amen amen what have you done to deserve this he just love you and then after loving you give all those secrets you prepare a city for choosing you and on the work that is finished you know when you say the work is finished it says you don't add you don't minus you live as it is job what God did and then who who we are today is the completion of God's [Music] work he trusted you to be in this last time because when he look at his program he saw you finishing his course a he could have make you Adam or Solomon make you who you are to finish this C because [Music] after that has God doing all those things so if God is doing this if you ask yourself question if God doing this for us what more do we need to do be a good follower a job is complete what more do you want unless we are waiting for something El if we are not waiting for some else we are in the same course let's just relax and let God finish his work with his work because all those things were in him little by little unfolding brothers and sisters we've got a spoken we called Seven Seals you will read it and read it and at the end not understand whats are until you wait for God to tell you what [Applause] Isen amen amen it was always like that now I'm going to to read the last scripture then I'll go to the quotes Revelation chapter 13 then at the end of the service you will be knowing that you are a Believer or not amen sometimes when you go to church we just vers 8 18 chapter 13 uh chapter 13:8 chapter 13 Revelation verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen amen my key words here is whose name were not written and the other one is a lamp was slain from the foundation of the world those are key because how can a lamb be slain before the foundation of the world while we see Jesus on the cross and being the lamb that one was the manifestation what happened found of the world you are just manifestation of what God had for you the foundation you are not just a creature from nowhere you are a creature from the foundation of the world your name was written by God himself saw the foundation of the world and he slay the lamb for you saw the foundation of the world God look at you in 2024 being a sinner and he applied that blood from the foundation of the world when he applied that blood it was what he had well all those things the lamb that was slain the L that were WR finished foration the predestinated the choing of us the prepared Kingdom the secret that were kept were like in a basket in something in God himself then at the right time he throw this one at the right time throw that one at the right time thr that one at the last you are the Bible in John 13:3 says those that come from God will go back to God amen amen there are people that does not come from God they will never go back to God when you get baptized you don't believe that day of bapm believed the before the foundation of world you are just manifesting who you are the life you live is the life you live amen amen you were with God and he decid to send you now let's start with Co now what brother is saying all the scriptures have just said future home of the Heavenly Bri and and the brother says now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin so God come down by a process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeem your soul if your soul is redeemed it was God doing that amen amen the day you receive the message is the day you recognize who you are God who is calling you to this message not because better it's because God visited you and said to you my child this is the time and The Time Is Now show the world who you made of we are here to show the world who we made of but I want to tell you this you can't do it if you were not there with you know us as human beings if we can start exposing our mistake you will you will realize that you won't reachen none of you will reach but Heaven Must come in you when it's in you no longer in yourself in you when you talk it's God talking everything is doing so you to come to church today God Did It For You Compass thinking you know better you don't know better the moment you think you know better [Applause] the more you question the word of God is the end of you God's provided way 19547 198 Amen brother says now we can preach the preaching the we explain the we but you have to receive the we not to preach or to explain but to receive the way because the word is God himself just receive in the beginning it was the word the word at the end becomes a flesh the word was this God the was God you he chose to indwell himself in you now listen to The Prophet I'm reading he said when you receive it the Revelation that weight is the Revelation when God is in you you no longer have questions answers because it's God in you something sleep out of the Unseen World y comes rolling a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul and now I see it when God reveal something to you down it doesn't need har textbook amen amen I'm saying this because other people because they think they have this this they think they made it in life not in the word of God in the word of God we say they that wait upon shall their Str those that work hard I'm not against School my kids are in school I told them they must go to university I'm not against school and I told my kids they must go to university but sometimes when you come from there don't think you are on top of your game God does not respect such respect the soul that [Applause] respect but there are other people if they didn't go to school they start you know shouting at people that went to school there are other people that fail to uh build a double story house they will saying of the devil you know in church people a politic but come to church you will see amen the people that stay in the sh one another you go to school you build a [Music] story are we together when someone couldn't get something he started to build a complex around the thing Christianity it's not Christianity you are a failure you fail to do somethingis Christi is when you know yourself and fight from the foundation you start you know in churches when you find groups even when we go out today you will see those one going for lunch somewhere one somewhere complex complex working in Sy calling it Christianity it's Christianity it's your own problem Christianity when you allow God in you Christianity is when you have 4x4 going to the multi Place gopel 4 for the pavement there in it's not a problem but we just need to know ourselves in the economy of God your condition does not explain what Christianity come to a level where God is in you you will do the right thing I pre the other day the main aim of God was to come down come down rolling down to you as a person when you stand up you a God God was in a journey the Journey of God ends in a human being and he stopped there that human being stand up we see God standing see God talking we see God walking preaching since that time came to us and then we started to know who we are I I I know I I know what I'm talking about amen amen now I see your eyes brighten your lips that hang down straighten up and your smile and every muscle in your body seem to Rejoice something going to happen you don't need a prayer line then [Applause] it amen amen the whole Heaven is in you when you want anything just claim there's a time for prayer there's a time for claim [Music] when he praying for those that need prayer but when it comes to claim there no smile taking back what belongs to him when you claim take back what belongs to you can I tell you [Applause] today this is the claiming time put your position when every situation come your [Applause] way amen amen the Mage testimony says and so that's the way a Christian get working with God rolling together amen and it brings the Unseen forces that does Mysteries that none of us know nothing about know it's God take that away from us with dead do you understand this statement so deeper than you thought take that out of us allad but it will never happen the scripture says if it was possible it will deceive the El but we [Music] know go and read the life story of brother as a teenager had a challeng as an adult he challenge as he get older he [Music] challenges but our God always was there he said you brother the anointed one amen amen the youthful challenges you shall pass the marriage challenges the elderly challeng you shall pass let learn from the men of God not because there's something better we can do God doing it brother as a person up protected him you as a person mess up but God is protecting you because this flesh [Music] issues that's we one if you can see somebody undermining you [Applause] just because undermine another soul soul Embrace another Soul cannot say who do you think you are a soul from God [Applause] never that's I'm going to show him and I will deal with him you are still dealing with one another we see what God has for us brother here a man running from the Pres of the Lord amen amen he said God he just chose the Jews God doing it with because you can say why didn't he choose the Chinese because when God Cho now he's being accused for not choosing the others what is it that satisfies a man always have question always analy and even put his mouth oh now it's flesh but when I read what the prophet is saying here was called for chosen for God's chosen people they were chosen for a specific CA and that CA was to give them the law that's the reason why God chose them so that we may know how law operates and they could not keep it everybody failed under the law that was the reason why chose them as to why he didn't choose the Greeks I don't know God chose the jewi and he just show by that people that the law could not be kept and the law demand righteousness but there's no Grace in law to bring a man out no penalty was paid by the law but taken Grace to pay that penalty or to wear the law put us under amen amen God just take a law put it in Israel Israel became the chosen nation of God you know what the people will always say why did he choose the jeice it looks like something is not going well here the white people are there those are the people the people are hardly believe what is happening in their surrounding they are hardly believed everything that is happening a question but if God chose CH Jewish instead of just saying amen God chose the Bride inste of saying am we will question God that's a nature of a human being interrogating that's what we learn on a daily basis why not this but amen amen until when God gave Holy Ghost to Peter and all then because they didn't have they wanted to buy you know that SCP in Acts where people wanted to buy Holy Ghost because they saw Holy Ghost Mir and they don't receive they were studying how they get those things realize that all and them clo in the house they pray and then they think by getting the Holy Ghost they must pray they went and pray they didn't receive they think oh maybe by going to you know people can investigate you follow you wherever you go and they come to church they realize oh in the church this message and they follow because they wanted the Holy Ghost and at the end they concluded no it's not by praying it's not by going to church it's not by doing this let's just give them money M you know money if we give themy the business people Sayes if you have money you can turn the world around if you find some difficulties and you have money things are easy that's why people with money are arrogant because when you talk they can tell you I can buy you I'm not talking about you I was just those yes those one are the one that came to church and to buy the Holy Ghost with money because they have many but little did they know that Holy Ghost you don't get it money but you get it when God decid to give it to you because he give you [Applause] himself amen amen Faith once delivered to the Saints amen it's a spoken wayen brother Bram says if you haven't receive the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit there's a place prepared for you in God's kingdom that God wants to bring you into it and you can receive the Holy Ghost if you'll just believe it's for believers not for make Believers not for unbelievers but for believers if you believe God giv it to you and what I like about God will make you believe him because you were a believer [Applause] now it doesn't come this way or that way don't think about that wait I'm reading what the prophet is saying they wait wait till something in here you will know when it comes stay here it's a part of you is your life if you can wait upon the Lord he will make sure he reveal all the secret unto you don't go pillar to PO don't try this and as is saying but he can tell you wait you know the Prophet Elijah the other day he said to young man go there next to the see and tell me what you see then he went there and come back he said I see nothing he said go again then he came back he said I see nothing then he go and go at the seven time that's when he said I see a small Cloud there can you compare that and what is happening today it will be go first come back for the second time come back the third time you go there Rel this old men when they get old they just send even themselves they don't know what they want an old man they say he becomes a child again isn't it what we say but the old man the word of God and he knew why sent young man to go and look there the old man becoming a Young Man instruction question they learn that question everything you come ACR in life can I tell you something be a good follower even if you think the old man he talking not a sense in you just listen and do because even the Bible say that's where wisdom [Music] is you know politics in church this will analyze that end up the whole thing just be a good from there when you look there beyond the K of time when you look there where God started to form things you realize you were there you never mess up here because that thing rolling from eternity Force found the space in your heart be the same [Music] again I'm just trying this and that so that the poor not hate the rich may not hate the poor not the because in church we have those kind of people but we must embrace one another not what we have here because other people mostly in the other churches they determine their blessing of what they have in the flesh if you don't have a big car if you don't have a big house if you don't have money if you don't have education they will look at you they don't [Applause] brother we are blessed When you pray must Place midnight you will see the angel coming now you go and pray midnight you praying when you say Amen the demons are here then you start asking yourself question don't determine success and prosperity based on what you have [Applause] we are not a church of elit but we are a Church of the Living God when you look at me brother TR My Flesh can trate my flesh penetrate My Flesh when you penetrate myself you will see the real me you my me from there but if you can look at me at the Flesh and Judge Me based on them messed up you will hate me from to amen amen we worship God from there not here amen what is attraction on the mountain return home for thus says the law the seven Mysteries that's been hi in the Bible for this years denomination and everything God is going to open those Mysteries to us in the Seven Seals he's going to open to us in the but you go and read the book you do not understand you need the prophet you need the pastor you need the spirit of God give you the guidance I'm saying be a good follow you know this young man elah sent times when he came back he became the beneficiary amen amen he was like I listened to amen amen sometimes be a good listener follower somewhere along the line you will become a [Applause] beneficiary amen even in the house you you look at your kids when you look at your kids if I can give him the secret of the house I'll be messing up this one if I can give him the secret of the house my legacy will go on then you look at them when the kids do things and when they do things as a parents we just keep quiet and observe make a contu that's what God did to us us and say Adam you go first brother you'll go last you think it was just something that happened it was the plan of God God is a Goodner knew about us this morning there's nothing that hit before God amen amen even on the devil side will [Music] look the secret of the this one will be with this one I was telling a brother he was complaining in the house Mommy D they just put everything on me my brothers are there my sisters are there they not existing everything on me the parents identified you and see this one will take us f amen amen that's what is happening even in God's economy us to finish this race it means that we are the most trusted people in because the the last one who take the bait is the one that run the because those secret weam lost them Abraham couldn't receive reive Mysteries that were hidden we know them we see them if you don't know them if you don't see them it's you but we are looking at the Unseen the one that created heaven and earth we see him in US amen amen an exposition of the seven Church ages chapter 3 amen Ephesians 8am says there was one thing that lost to the scientist world we believe some of the things are right they are there but some of the things and reveal them unto us brother never went to school but God told him that between a man and a Chim there was a man called serpent L with brother with brother it was revealed God show him that link and today we are the beneficiary of all those things that were lost along the way that were not revealed to the people know them we see them that is why we know where you come from where we are know where we are going [Applause] a child of God is not a slanderer if I don't understand something I will wait for God to make me understand and he will himself come to reveal it unto me not with researches but with waiting rece that's where hopefully there's a different and gap between the world we are living in sci world world we are living in for you to know you must research and they will tell you even assignment go and research and come back but in the world above you don't research you wait for for that world above for that world above to give it to [Applause] you the world above give it to you you don't reset the word you are living inarch you don't wait when you wait they say you are lazy so you must also differentiate when we are Liv in this world we are living in you work hard support your [Music] [Applause] family and others misunderstood me they are going to be lazy and they say this is a church if the church is 2,000 people 2000 problem people thinking differently they will misunderstood you and you take your children out of school and the preacher said wait we didn't say that the kids must go to school and work hard resarch they must wait [Applause] for Spiritual matters amen amen speak to the Rock spoken with amen we know we pass over that t think all the things that Mysteries now when our eyes close and we wake him it will not be a mysterious day all great Mysteries that we do not understand will just be there when we live this wonderful amen amen believe thou this brother Bram says go on if your name is not in heaven you will go to hell too that's right only those are Nam WR in the Lamb's Book of Life by the redeemed Born Again Jesus said except a man be born again he will not enter the kingom unless a man dra by my father never enter Heaven here you can see that our efforts are finished is God in his work you are the work of God when God is in his work you everything you want to do so where's your effort where's your knowledge nowhere amen Blasphemous name amen and this lamb today that we fall known by God can you see all thisn before where are you what are you going to put as your own knowledge in of God and God called there's a redeemer no man can come to me except my father throws him and all the father has given me will come to me I think I say this thing many a times that even the people that they no longer worship you can't do you can't help it it's God chasing them out the moment when you start to think you are leaving to worship because they have offended you it was allowing them for you to go because for you to leave they must offend you God said my to is is God who did that then you sit there someone the reason being don't belong [Applause] here because God uses people God has done everything for us don't sit there blaming other people sit there blaming yourself for decision because the Bible says when that war started you you you took a stand sustaining you today can I say something we are being sustained by work by the decision we made there amen if you were a child of God that thing will sustain you here a child of the devil suain you here I was telling you the other day had a friend of mine up together when this message I was still young in the barding school then I was

need pastorship anymore because they have spoken weight they have everything and reading you must have a shepher amen amen that's what is happening in this message of the hour but everyone is taking his way amen but a lamp was provided before the foundation of the world us because God news that we will be in shape in iniquity have no direction and that was the only way us back the lamb to cleans our you know the your Bible readers again the Bible says in the olden days they used to the devil used to report the children of God this one has this brother and God said let them just kill a dove or a goat or a sheep something you know that was then but today amen amen did you read the one that used to accuse you report you in God he doesn't have access anymore the devil doesn't have access

tell meally what you understand about this Israel and the politic then I said bibl the Bible says whoever cast Israel cast whoever bless Israel he said don't go further I understood the politician that cures Israel has punished I'm talking about South Africa not to mention are those that talk good about Israel that nation of God people they bless it [Applause] Flames C the anointed one you will receive Flames irrespective how logical you can be God is looking at him because his face he behold the face of the Father God can take 10 things like this you can go to The Stadium fill up the stadium people but once you Israel when the people go to the voting po they don't vote for you because you cast Israel you shall be cast and you will even cry you don't know what hits you brothers and sisters the best thing you can do the word of God Amen some other things we just look and smile oh Jesus six spoken we the Bible said in the last days as I'm closing everything that wasn't predestinated elect now anybody and take that word and run it back your imine reading in your imine reading seeing see what it means it says the elected predestinated it will fool every one of them whose names not on the lamp's Book of Life the foundation of you know what is happening the word of God is like a double edged the the word of God from theit it gives as I'm talking now here in the church today amen amen amen that's the word of God it bring separation to amen amen it will fool everyone whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world that is the word of God it's coming from the pull pit going to the people brother says either that way bless youn you me brother after you will say now why you say it's not me blame God amen amen the anointed one at the end time brother says in the Revelation here the Antichrist that raised in the last days done SS and wonders that even the deceived that that are dwell upon the face of the Earth

strengthening you to stand FM if you are not FM strengthened by the scriptures the code throw you out the work of the go the work of God is to come and strengthen those that believe God Chase those that not belong to God is the word of God doing that preacher I even said to one brother the brother says even the PRI himself do not have a message the church that's a message chur When you pray for a certain message God will bring a preacher to answer your [Applause] question but many of times we want to assassinate a preach for saying this and that but it was just God using him was just you prayed for that message answering your question amen that is what is happening in life amen amen so now the Bible here says signs and wonders will be done to deceive the people on the face of the Earth but those on that their name were not written in of life in closing my key kept the kingom was prepared elction of the children done nothing he chose you he predestinated us and in a complete job those things were made known unto us I want to tell you today we do not have questions but we have an all a question it we are the Blessed people that God chose this race is that the case the only best thing you can do one brother sent me a message he said the only thing that we can do this time is not to look on the left not look on the right where God is calling us on the left on the right is
