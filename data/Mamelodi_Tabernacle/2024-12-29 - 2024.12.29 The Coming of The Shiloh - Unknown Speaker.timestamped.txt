[1:18:46] it, God will miss

[1:18:53] Whether under the sea, whether wherever
[1:18:56] you be, God will come looking for
[1:18:59] you, as David said in the books of

[1:20:55] Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[1:21:00] Richie. May be seated for a moment.
[1:21:09] I want to first thank
[1:21:14] God for letting me come here
[1:21:19] and uh preach for
[1:21:24] you because it's a privilege for
[1:21:28] me to be standing at this pulpit
[1:21:34] and I thank Pastor
[1:21:38] our
[1:21:40] elder as I call him
[1:21:45] my father
[1:21:50] because pastor
[1:21:54] I always say pastor is my
[1:22:00] daddy is my father not only physically
[1:22:07] But especially in the seven seas,
[1:22:16] you know you here you cannot realize how
[1:22:19] privileged you are.
[1:22:26] I know I know many of you you don't
[1:22:29] realize it.
[1:22:34] But if you go around the
[1:22:39] world, if you have the opportunity to
[1:22:42] listen to ministers in the
[1:22:48] world, how they preach this
[1:22:53] message, then you realize the value of
[1:22:57] having pastor as
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:08] I have been personally in many
[1:23:12] places and I heard many
[1:23:17] pastors
[1:23:19] but let me say
[1:23:21] something. Pastor Kodima
[1:23:25] is the only
[1:23:29] pastor not in South Africa,
[1:23:33] not even in Africa,
[1:23:36] but I mean in the world.
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:49] Now I'm I'm telling you those things
[1:23:51] from my heart.
[1:23:54] These things I say
[1:23:57] come from my heart
[1:24:01] and God knows my
[1:24:06] heart and uh I think I will speak about
[1:24:09] those things in a few
[1:24:12] minutes so that we can
[1:24:15] realize that even in South Africa
[1:24:20] if Someone
[1:24:23] has been predestinated
[1:24:27] to go into that rapture.
[1:24:30] Are you ready?
[1:24:33] He must be here.
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:43] Hallelujah.
[1:24:45] So, it's a honor for
[1:24:48] me to be standing at this pulpit.
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:24:58] Okay, let's go to the word now.
[1:25:03] As we can stand, we read the word.
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:11] You know those scriptures, we are
[1:25:13] familiar to those scriptures.
[1:25:18] We start by Revelation chapter
[1:25:21] 10 from verse one to verse 7. Verse 1 to
[1:25:25] 7. The Bible say, "And I saw another
[1:25:28] mighty angel come down from
[1:25:33] heaven clothed with a cloud,
[1:25:38] and a rainbow was upon his
[1:25:41] head, and his face was as it were the
[1:25:46] sun, and his feet as pillars of
[1:25:51] fire." And he had in his hand a little
[1:25:54] book open,
[1:25:58] And he set his right foot upon the
[1:26:03] sea and his left foot on the
[1:26:06] earth. And cried with a loud
[1:26:10] voice as when a lion
[1:26:13] roar. And when he had
[1:26:15] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[1:26:19] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[1:26:22] uttered their voices,
[1:26:26] I was about to
[1:26:28] write and I heard a voice from heaven
[1:26:31] saying unto
[1:26:34] me, "Seal up those
[1:26:38] things which the seven thunders
[1:26:41] uttered and write them
[1:26:45] not." And the angel which I
[1:26:48] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[1:26:52] earth lifted his hands to
[1:26:57] heaven and swear by him that
[1:27:02] liveth and
[1:27:03] heaven who created
[1:27:06] heaven and the things that
[1:27:09] therein and the earth and the things
[1:27:13] that therein
[1:27:14] are and the sea and the things which are
[1:27:19] therein that there should be
[1:27:23] time. But in the days of the voice of
[1:27:26] the seventh
[1:27:28] angel,
[1:27:30] when he shall begin to
[1:27:33] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:27:38] finished as he had declared to his
[1:27:41] servant the prophets.
[1:27:45] Okay, let's to another scripture in
[1:27:47] Genesis 40 49
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:53] beginning by the verse 8 up to 10 8 to
[1:27:57] 10 Genesis 40
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:02] 49 Genesis
[1:28:05] 49 verse
[1:28:11] 8 this I wait until you get there. So,
[1:28:14] because that's my main
[1:28:18] inspiration. Are you
[1:28:21] there? Okay, let's read now.
[1:28:25] Judah. Judah.
[1:28:28] Thou art he whom thy brethren shall
[1:28:36] praise. Thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:28:40] thy enemies.
[1:28:44] Thy father's children shall bow down
[1:28:48] before thee.
[1:28:52] Judah is a lion.
[1:28:56] Well, from the prey, my son, thou art
[1:29:00] gone
[1:29:03] up. He stoop
[1:29:06] down. He couches his lion.
[1:29:12] He he okay he yes and as an old lion
[1:29:20] who shall rose him up
[1:29:27] the s shall not depart from
[1:29:32] Judah nor a lawgiver from between his
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:40] feet until Shiloh
[1:29:45] came and unto him shall the gathering of
[1:29:49] the people
[1:29:54] be. Amen. Amen. Let's take the last one.
[1:29:59] Colossians
[1:30:01] chapter one.
[1:30:05] The last one. Colossians chapter 1
[1:30:09] vers 27- 28 27- 28
[1:30:15] to whom God would make known what?
[1:30:22] What is the riches of the glory of this
[1:30:28] mystery among the
[1:30:32] Gentiles which is Christ in you.
[1:30:39] The hope of
[1:30:43] glory whom we
[1:30:46] preach, warning every
[1:30:50] man and teaching every man in all
[1:30:58] wisdom that we may present every man
[1:31:01] perfect in Christ Jesus.
[1:31:09] May God bless his word. May be
[1:31:14] seated. And this morning I took my
[1:31:20] subject and it's
[1:31:23] entitled the coming of the
[1:31:29] Shiloh. Shiloh. the coming
[1:31:33] of the child.
[1:31:37] You know, it was when Jacob was blessing
[1:31:41] his
[1:31:45] sons like every father can do with his
[1:31:52] sons to bless
[1:31:55] them. And Jacob was blessing his sons.
[1:32:00] which one was coming.
[1:32:03] He started by
[1:32:05] Reuben. Then came
[1:32:07] Judah. Judah. When Jacob came to Judah,
[1:32:14] he blessed Judah.
[1:32:17] He said, Judah, you will be praised by
[1:32:20] all your brothers.
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:25] You will be a king.
[1:32:27] You will have the sector of
[1:32:31] king. It will never leave
[1:32:35] you. You
[1:32:39] reign because you remember from Judah
[1:32:42] came Jesus.
[1:32:47] So Jacob as a
[1:32:50] prophet was
[1:32:53] prophesying that from his son
[1:32:57] Judah will come a
[1:33:01] king. And that king will have the s of
[1:33:06] king and it will never
[1:33:09] leave Judah.
[1:33:12] But he had
[1:33:15] it
[1:33:17] until the Shiloh came.
[1:33:22] I know many many are read the Bible
[1:33:26] readers but many have not yet checked
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:33] word. I did. I
[1:33:37] did. And even the theologians
[1:33:42] they could not understand exactly what
[1:33:45] does it
[1:33:47] mean. They gave many meanings to that
[1:33:51] word. Some say it's
[1:33:55] messiah. Shiloh means
[1:33:58] messiah. Some of them say Shiloh means a
[1:34:02] messenger of peace.
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:06] But I took the correct
[1:34:11] interpretation. They say shallow means
[1:34:16] he to him to whom it belongs.
[1:34:23] He to
[1:34:26] whom it belongs.
[1:34:31] Judah Judah will reign.
[1:34:36] until he to whom it belongs shall come.
[1:34:46] There is
[1:34:47] someone who those things belongs
[1:34:52] to the
[1:34:54] authority, the
[1:34:57] dominion, and the reign upon the earth.
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:06] That's a man.
[1:35:11] Man
[1:35:12] is he to
[1:35:16] whom that
[1:35:18] authority that power that authority
[1:35:23] belongs.
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:28] Let's get into that.
[1:35:31] Are you ready? Now
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:36] this message,
[1:35:38] this message is a mysterious message.
[1:35:44] There is a message in the
[1:35:50] message. This message is not for the
[1:35:53] multitude of people.
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:57] This message is from
[1:36:02] eternity. This message is not of the
[1:36:06] time. But the message is a message
[1:36:11] beyond the
[1:36:13] time. A message of
[1:36:17] redemption. Which means this is
[1:36:21] something to bring you back to what you
[1:36:24] were.
[1:36:31] That's
[1:36:32] why many people don't get exactly what
[1:36:36] the message is.
[1:36:42] The prophet
[1:36:44] says in the first
[1:36:48] seal paragraph 68,
[1:36:52] the prophet
[1:36:54] says when God sent
[1:36:58] messengers during 2,000
[1:37:02] years, it was just the
[1:37:05] time the
[1:37:07] messengers came through the
[1:37:10] ages each messengers brought his own
[1:37:17] message. You know in a time in a
[1:37:22] age everything in the Bible cannot give
[1:37:25] you
[1:37:27] life. Life can only comes by the message
[1:37:31] of your
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:36] hour. And when the hour change
[1:37:40] You must
[1:37:41] follow the pillar of fire because life
[1:37:46] can only follow the message of the
[1:37:51] hour. So when you are living in an age,
[1:37:56] the first thing you must
[1:37:57] do is to
[1:38:00] recognize what is exactly the message of
[1:38:05] your age.
[1:38:10] Because in each age there is
[1:38:13] promises related to this
[1:38:17] age. Let me put it like
[1:38:19] this. All the promise in the Bible
[1:38:22] cannot give you life.
[1:38:28] Now only the promises of your age can
[1:38:33] give you salvation.
[1:38:38] can deliver you, can bless your soul,
[1:38:42] can save
[1:38:43] you. Not hold the
[1:38:45] Bible. You know those
[1:38:48] denominations, they have the same Bible.
[1:38:51] They read the Bible. They believe in
[1:38:54] Jesus. But why are not they going to the
[1:38:59] rapture? They believe in Jesus. They
[1:39:03] believe in baptism. Some of them don't
[1:39:05] drink. They live cleanly. But why they
[1:39:09] don't go to the
[1:39:11] rapture? Ask yourself that
[1:39:13] question. Because they miss
[1:39:17] something. And we when we come
[1:39:20] here, we must preach what they miss.
[1:39:26] If you come here and you continue to
[1:39:30] listen to the very same
[1:39:32] things, that means there is something
[1:39:34] wrong somewhere.
[1:39:39] The prophet
[1:39:40] says until it comes to that last
[1:39:46] angel. You all know who is the last
[1:39:48] angel.
[1:39:51] That's the prophet. our
[1:39:55] prophets. And the prophet says, "Now
[1:39:59] when that last angel
[1:40:01] came, he has no certain mystery."
[1:40:06] He has no certain
[1:40:10] mystery, but he gathers up all that's
[1:40:13] been lost in the all the ages.
[1:40:18] all the truth that was not truly
[1:40:22] revealed. As the revelation
[1:40:25] came, then he reveals those things in
[1:40:29] his
[1:40:31] day. If you want to read it, there it
[1:40:35] is. Revelation 10 one to about
[1:40:39] four. You get it. All right. Amen. see
[1:40:44] takes the
[1:40:45] book of the
[1:40:47] seals, breaks
[1:40:49] them
[1:40:50] and shows the seven
[1:40:54] angel. Now listen, the prophecies,
[1:40:59] for this alone,
[1:41:04] the
[1:41:06] mysteries of
[1:41:08] God
[1:41:10] is the ministry
[1:41:13] of the seven
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:18] angels. What is the ministry of Brham?
[1:41:25] This this alone
[1:41:30] the mysteries
[1:41:32] is the ministry of brother.
[1:41:37] Any message
[1:41:41] church who don't preach the
[1:41:45] mysteries of
[1:41:46] God don't preach the ministry of the
[1:41:50] seven angel.
[1:41:56] You should be coming here every
[1:42:00] day. Listen only to the
[1:42:06] mysteries because the mysteries
[1:42:11] alone is the ministry of the seven
[1:42:17] nations. Amen. Are we together?
[1:42:23] Let me proceed.
[1:42:26] When God sent the prophet,
[1:42:29] the message of the prophet got
[1:42:35] twopart. It's a twofold
[1:42:40] ministry, a
[1:42:42] twofold
[1:42:45] mystery. There is an evangelical part.
[1:42:51] in the message of the
[1:42:53] prophet and there is also a prophetical
[1:42:59] part. When God sent the prophet, he say
[1:43:02] you plays the role of an
[1:43:09] evangelist. But it's not your
[1:43:13] ministry. You just
[1:43:16] start by being an evangelist.
[1:43:21] Then when come the
[1:43:24] time, I will send you as a
[1:43:29] prophet because an evangelist cannot
[1:43:33] reveal the
[1:43:39] mysteries. An
[1:43:41] evangelist is not a revealer of the
[1:43:47] mysteries. to reveal the
[1:43:50] mysteries. The part the prophet must
[1:43:53] pass from the evangelical
[1:43:56] part to the prophetic
[1:43:59] one because only a prophet is a
[1:44:06] revealer of the
[1:44:08] mysteries. Amen.
[1:44:11] But what the devil is doing
[1:44:16] now, I'm sorry to tell you
[1:44:19] that the majority of the
[1:44:24] churches who call themselves the message
[1:44:28] of the
[1:44:29] hour, they are still dealing with that
[1:44:33] evangelical
[1:44:37] pass, teaching no mysteries.
[1:44:41] No seven seas, no seven thunders,
[1:44:45] no god sheep,
[1:44:49] [Applause]
[1:44:56] but to go to the rapture,
[1:45:01] you must pass from that
[1:45:05] evangelical to the prophetic one.
[1:45:10] Because to be prepared for the rapture,
[1:45:14] you must be taught the
[1:45:17] mysteries and the mysteries
[1:45:21] alone.
[1:45:25] Amen. The mysteries
[1:45:28] only. You know what happened with the
[1:45:30] prophet?
[1:45:32] When God sent
[1:45:33] him, he was a
[1:45:36] forer that the evangelical
[1:45:39] like John the Baptist. That's what the
[1:45:41] prophet says.
[1:45:43] And let me read it for you.
[1:45:49] It's in the message. The bridge between
[1:45:51] the seven seas and the seven church
[1:45:54] ages. Let's start by the the paragraph
[1:45:57] 39.
[1:46:00] I will explain something to you so that
[1:46:01] you must not uh uh miss
[1:46:04] it because if you miss that part, you
[1:46:07] won't make it for the
[1:46:10] rapture. You are just wasting your time
[1:46:12] in the
[1:46:13] church because the prophet says the
[1:46:16] mysteries are the things that will start
[1:46:17] the rapturing
[1:46:22] faith. You cannot just be sitting here
[1:46:24] and waiting for the rapture.
[1:46:28] You must be
[1:46:30] prepared. And the thing that prepare you
[1:46:32] for the
[1:46:33] rapture is the miss of
[1:46:36] God. Who God
[1:46:41] is. Who God is.
[1:46:46] The prophet says this. He said now 39.
[1:46:50] The bridge. The bridge. He said now it
[1:46:54] wrote mysterious
[1:46:57] Because no man,
[1:46:59] nowhere knows it. You know this message,
[1:47:03] no man, nowhere, no churches know this
[1:47:08] message. The prophet said God
[1:47:12] alone. Jesus Christ is the only one who
[1:47:15] knows something about you. And when you
[1:47:18] happen to know something about those
[1:47:21] nearnesses, it means that God has came
[1:47:25] upon
[1:47:27] you. It's a choice from
[1:47:30] God to reveal himself to
[1:47:33] you. Because if God don't come to you,
[1:47:37] you cannot understand those things.
[1:47:40] There is people here in the church they
[1:47:43] will understand
[1:47:44] nothing because the name were not put on
[1:47:49] the book of
[1:47:50] life. If you understand those things,
[1:47:54] that means that before the foundation of
[1:47:57] the
[1:47:58] world, God by his
[1:48:00] mercy put your name in the book of
[1:48:04] life and no one can blot it
[1:48:10] out. God alone, let's let's stud it. God
[1:48:14] alone knows it. It's a book.
[1:48:19] The prophet say it's a mysterious
[1:48:23] book. The book sealed with seven
[1:48:28] sins. It's a mysterious
[1:48:32] book. Powerful
[1:48:35] book that can bring you back to what you
[1:48:39] were, cleanse
[1:48:41] you and make you
[1:48:44] pure. This mysterious book can take you
[1:48:48] to heaven
[1:48:50] now. Amen. There is something inside
[1:48:54] that
[1:48:55] book that every predestinated must
[1:48:59] know because the things that contain in
[1:49:02] that
[1:49:03] book, prepare you for the
[1:49:06] rapture. Mysterious
[1:49:09] book, it's it's the book. The prophet
[1:49:13] say it's the book of redemption.
[1:49:16] You know what redemption
[1:49:18] means? Redemption
[1:49:20] means go back to where you
[1:49:25] were. You cannot listen to the
[1:49:28] message. If you were not there for the
[1:49:32] beginning, only those who were there in
[1:49:36] the beginning can listen to what I'm
[1:49:39] preaching
[1:49:40] today. Those people are there in this in
[1:49:43] the room. This are they there? The
[1:49:45] people who are
[1:49:47] there are you
[1:49:49] there? Amen.
[1:49:51] Redemption
[1:49:52] means you were there for the first
[1:49:55] time. You see? Amen. It's not something
[1:49:58] you can make up or wake
[1:50:00] up something that you have to force it.
[1:50:04] It's not by
[1:50:05] might not by your own will not by
[1:50:08] prayers.
[1:50:10] It's a choice of
[1:50:12] God because before the foundation of the
[1:50:16] world, God saw you
[1:50:19] there. And since God saw you
[1:50:21] there, he must brings you back to where
[1:50:24] you
[1:50:25] were. So now the mechanics to bring you
[1:50:30] back is contained in that mysterious
[1:50:35] book. It's a book of redemption.
[1:50:43] You know when we preaching it's like we
[1:50:45] are forcing people to believe.
[1:50:49] Let me tell you we are not forcing
[1:50:53] people. Only those who were
[1:50:57] there in the beginning can receive the
[1:51:01] message and go to the
[1:51:05] [Applause]
[1:51:07] rapture. Let's go. It's it's a book of
[1:51:10] redemption.
[1:51:12] Let's let's put it there. It's easier
[1:51:13] for me. It's a book of redemption. The
[1:51:16] prophecy will get into
[1:51:19] that. Listen now. And now we know the
[1:51:23] this book of
[1:51:25] redemption, will not
[1:51:28] be
[1:51:30] understood. No, we
[1:51:32] cannot. The churches cannot understand.
[1:51:37] It's
[1:51:39] probate through six church ages ages
[1:51:43] they were
[1:51:45] presuming they were trying to
[1:51:47] understand because during the the 2,000
[1:51:50] years of
[1:51:52] churches they could not understand it
[1:51:55] because those things are beyond the
[1:51:59] time.
[1:52:02] This
[1:52:03] ministry is a ministry from beyond the
[1:52:08] time. When you are in the time in church
[1:52:11] ages, you cannot
[1:52:16] understand. The
[1:52:18] angel comes when time is
[1:52:22] over. And what you are listening
[1:52:25] today comes from
[1:52:28] eternity. Because the eternity is
[1:52:31] here. Uh I don't listen to your
[1:52:34] amen. Give me another one
[1:52:38] please. The prophet says when the seven
[1:52:42] angel
[1:52:44] came they brought
[1:52:49] eternity.
[1:52:52] Eternity came into time.
[1:52:57] And if you receive that book
[1:53:00] today,
[1:53:02] eternity will get into your
[1:53:07] soul and then you became a candidate for
[1:53:10] the
[1:53:12] [Applause]
[1:53:14] rapture. But if you are still on that
[1:53:17] path, evangelical
[1:53:21] path, you won't go nowhere.
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:27] But but you'll be a good
[1:53:29] sister, a good
[1:53:32] brother. Every every man in your
[1:53:35] neighborhood say good things about
[1:53:39] me. It's a good brother. It's a good
[1:53:43] sister. Let me tell you, I'm not
[1:53:47] good. But God lives in me. That makes me
[1:53:53] good.
[1:53:57] The prophet says the mountain was not a
[1:54:01] holy
[1:54:03] mountain. When
[1:54:07] Peter went there on the mountain, Peter
[1:54:10] says, "We were on the holy
[1:54:13] mountain." And the prophet says, "The
[1:54:16] mountain was not
[1:54:18] holy, but the holy
[1:54:20] one. When he came to the
[1:54:23] mountain, the mountain became a holy
[1:54:25] one.
[1:54:31] The problem with the
[1:54:32] people, they want to become holy by
[1:54:37] themselves. You cannot be
[1:54:41] holy. There is nothing in you can make
[1:54:45] you
[1:54:47] holy. Paul say in the
[1:54:50] Bible, that's a
[1:54:52] mystery. When Christ come in you, that's
[1:54:57] the hope of
[1:55:00] glory. Amen.
[1:55:03] A holy
[1:55:05] God living in the
[1:55:08] people makes those
[1:55:10] people holy. Brothers and
[1:55:16] [Applause]
[1:55:20] sisters, when John was baptizing,
[1:55:25] It was his
[1:55:26] age because the prophet said in the age
[1:55:30] you got
[1:55:34] seasons. You can have an
[1:55:37] age but you forget that in the age you
[1:55:41] got
[1:55:45] seasons. You must be in the
[1:55:48] air, the right
[1:55:51] end, but in the wrong
[1:55:58] season. When John was
[1:56:00] baptizing, that was the age. And he
[1:56:04] said, "Someone is coming after
[1:56:07] me." Then Jesus came. When Jesus came,
[1:56:12] John is saying, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:56:16] who takes away the sin of the world."
[1:56:22] And
[1:56:23] then two only
[1:56:26] [Applause]
[1:56:28] followed only two followed Jesus.
[1:56:33] The Bible says the next
[1:56:36] day people came back to the same place.
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:41] with John baptizing
[1:56:46] when Jesus was already
[1:56:49] there. Pay attention to
[1:56:52] that when the
[1:56:55] forana introduce the
[1:56:57] coming. You follow the one who has
[1:57:03] come. Amen.
[1:57:07] Amen. Amen. The prophet
[1:57:10] continue. That's good. The prophet says,
[1:57:14] "But at the
[1:57:15] end, when the seventh angel begins to
[1:57:19] sound his
[1:57:23] mist, the prophet calls this
[1:57:28] part as a
[1:57:31] forunner. He called this part the
[1:57:33] preparation days.
[1:57:37] He was preparing the
[1:57:39] people because the message was supposed
[1:57:43] to come
[1:57:47] after when the prophet started his
[1:57:51] ministry. That was not the
[1:57:54] message. That was a
[1:57:58] preparation of a
[1:58:00] forer. He was doing the work of an
[1:58:04] evangelist.
[1:58:10] healing
[1:58:11] vision,
[1:58:13] discerning
[1:58:15] campaigns, those words just
[1:58:20] evangelical and you know when you are in
[1:58:22] this
[1:58:24] path everyone is good for you know they
[1:58:28] like you they congratulate you you're a
[1:58:32] good man you will see the power of God
[1:58:35] But when the message
[1:58:38] came they reject
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:44] you there will be no
[1:58:49] association because now you are in the
[1:58:55] message. You are in the message
[1:58:58] now. Let them go away.
[1:59:03] When they want to go, let them
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:07] go. You stay
[1:59:10] here. Don't go
[1:59:16] nowhere. That's the
[1:59:22] message. They they are making it to
[1:59:24] become so comprehensive so that people
[1:59:27] can understand.
[1:59:31] No. Uhuh. Jesus did not do that. Jesus
[1:59:34] said, "You eat my
[1:59:38] flesh. You drink my
[1:59:41] bread." And they come to the Bible. They
[1:59:44] say, "Moses said, Moses
[1:59:47] said, don't drink the Bible." Jesus
[1:59:50] said, I
[1:59:55] say even if it's not in the Bible,
[1:59:59] it's a
[2:00:05] message. The prophet said something
[2:00:09] happened when God want to gather his
[2:00:15] group, something will happen.
[2:00:21] And God do that
[2:00:26] purposely so that those who are not
[2:00:30] predestinated will
[2:00:33] stumble and they will go
[2:00:35] away. Please
[2:00:38] deacons don't follow
[2:00:45] them. Don't follow them.
[2:00:48] If they were of
[2:00:51] God, they will understand who is
[2:00:56] [Applause]
[2:00:59] pastor. Since they don't know
[2:01:02] pastor, that means they don't
[2:01:07] know. If they don't know
[2:01:09] brother, it means they don't know Jesus.
[2:01:17] Because the
[2:01:20] mysteries is the word of
[2:01:22] God. Amen. And the word of God is Jesus
[2:01:28] [Applause]
[2:01:30] Christ. Amen. Let's
[2:01:33] go. Listen to the the prophet says at
[2:01:37] the end when the seven angel begin to
[2:01:41] sound his
[2:01:44] He winds up all of those
[2:01:55] ene fellows during the church
[2:01:59] ages like
[2:02:03] Luther. They were preaching about
[2:02:05] sanctification without knowing the true
[2:02:07] real sanctification.
[2:02:13] Even Luther was preaching justification
[2:02:16] without
[2:02:20] knowing. When the prophet came, he said
[2:02:23] justification means
[2:02:27] revelation.
[2:02:30] Justification because that's your faith.
[2:02:33] Faith means a revelation.
[2:02:38] And when you have a
[2:02:40] revelation that you are
[2:02:43] justified and to be justified
[2:02:47] means you have been forgiven a god
[2:02:50] that's
[2:02:53] forgotten. And the prophet says for God
[2:02:58] it's like you have never done
[2:03:01] it to start from the beginning. Yeah.
[2:03:04] From the beginning.
[2:03:09] And they tried to understand those
[2:03:11] things they could not but
[2:03:15] now listen and the
[2:03:18] mysteries comes down from
[2:03:23] God
[2:03:24] as the word of
[2:03:27] God. The mysteries are the word of God.
[2:03:33] If you don't preach the mystery, you
[2:03:35] don't preach the word of God. Amen.
[2:03:39] Listen to me
[2:03:41] people. If a preacher does not preach to
[2:03:44] you the
[2:03:46] message, that
[2:03:48] preacher don't preach the word of
[2:03:52] God. Because for this
[2:03:55] time, the
[2:03:57] mysteries comes down from God as the
[2:04:00] word of God.
[2:04:05] Amen. And reveals the
[2:04:10] entire revelation of
[2:04:14] God. You know now who God
[2:04:22] is. The churches know who God was.
[2:04:32] He came. He died for our
[2:04:35] sins. That was what he
[2:04:40] was. But the
[2:04:42] mystery teaches what God
[2:04:47] is in the
[2:04:50] present now in
[2:04:53] the Amen. Who God is now.
[2:04:59] That's the word of God.
[2:05:04] Amen. Amen. The prophet continues.
[2:05:10] Let me go fast.
[2:05:12] He say then the
[2:05:16] Godhead and
[2:05:18] everything is
[2:05:20] settled. Amen.
[2:05:22] The people who has been preaching the
[2:05:26] mysteries, they have the
[2:05:28] revelation of the
[2:05:31] godhead who God definitely
[2:05:35] is. The prophet say when the seven se
[2:05:39] will be
[2:05:41] opened, you will know who God
[2:05:46] is, how he
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:50] lives and his
[2:05:53] nature.
[2:05:55] God will be in a man.
[2:05:59] [Music]
[2:06:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Because God
[2:06:06] lives in a
[2:06:11] man. That's what he is,
[2:06:16] not what he
[2:06:19] was or what he will
[2:06:22] be, what saves
[2:06:24] you,
[2:06:26] revelation of who he
[2:06:29] is, amen.
[2:06:32] That's why even the prophet when he was
[2:06:34] preaching about
[2:06:38] Mechisedc the prophet didn't say who is
[2:06:44] that because knowing
[2:06:48] that cannot help
[2:06:51] you but the prophet preached
[2:06:59] mec because mechedc
[2:07:03] is keeping running along the
[2:07:10] churches. He has been changing the
[2:07:15] f because God is in more
[2:07:23] faith. People are just taking to that
[2:07:27] one form
[2:07:29] of the pictures that they
[2:07:33] know. Even the
[2:07:35] pope know that
[2:07:38] picture
[2:07:40] man. But
[2:07:42] God is in a man
[2:07:45] [Applause]
[2:07:47] today. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:52] Let me continue.
[2:07:55] The prophet says
[2:07:57] then it will be settled.
[2:08:01] Then it will be settled.
[2:08:04] Let's take breach between the 70. We are
[2:08:06] there 40. Okay.
[2:08:10] Let me think something something else
[2:08:11] and
[2:08:13] go. You know the problem
[2:08:19] is men in the beginning
[2:08:23] The prophet says this, let me take you
[2:08:26] the uncertain sound.
[2:08:29] Uncertain sound.
[2:08:34] Paragraph 34.
[2:08:38] Maybe you don't know that. You know when
[2:08:41] Jesus when Jesus
[2:08:43] came Jesus Christ
[2:08:48] is God.
[2:08:50] Amen.
[2:08:52] Amen. But he took a temple
[2:08:58] what was called Jesus.
[2:09:02] Amen.
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:05] Jesus was the temple
[2:09:08] where Jesus Christ lives.
[2:09:14] It was a temple. He himself said destroy
[2:09:18] this body.
[2:09:21] And the Bible say he was talking about
[2:09:24] the temple of his
[2:09:28] body. You
[2:09:30] see people sometimes think
[2:09:33] that
[2:09:36] Christ is a surname of Jesus.
[2:09:43] You are laughing. But many people here
[2:09:47] think that if you can s you can you can
[2:09:50] you can see the ID card of
[2:09:54] Jesus
[2:09:56] ID of Jesus. Do you see the name Jesus
[2:10:01] name
[2:10:05] Christ? Let me tell you that's not it.
[2:10:10] Christ is not the surname of
[2:10:13] Christ. The angel told Joseph and
[2:10:18] Mary before
[2:10:21] Jesus came, the angel said, "You will
[2:10:25] call that baby
[2:10:29] Jesus, not Lord Jesus Christ."
[2:10:34] That young boy when he was praying
[2:10:38] there his friend were not calling me.
[2:10:41] Hey Lord Jesus
[2:10:45] Christ. Lord Jesus Christ come and play
[2:10:48] ball with
[2:10:50] me. No, he was called Jesus.
[2:10:55] But after he
[2:10:57] died,
[2:10:59] resurrected,
[2:11:02] ascended, then at the day of Pentecost,
[2:11:06] Peter for the very first
[2:11:09] time, he say to the people, that
[2:11:14] man, not that
[2:11:17] God, that man that you
[2:11:21] killed because God cannot be killed.
[2:11:25] But Jesus
[2:11:28] died. Amen.
[2:11:33] That
[2:11:34] man that you
[2:11:36] kill God made him
[2:11:43] and
[2:11:44] Christ. Amen.
[2:11:50] Christ
[2:11:52] is a an
[2:11:54] adjective adjective to
[2:11:58] qualify someone who has been anointed.
[2:12:05] Christ means a man being anointed.
[2:12:12] When God anointed man that man becomes
[2:12:19] Christ and Christ
[2:12:22] is the
[2:12:25] mystery of God
[2:12:31] revealed. A mysterious
[2:12:35] God become known to the people.
[2:12:39] Many
[2:12:41] men walk to the
[2:12:43] people anointed with God. And when you
[2:12:47] see that man,
[2:12:49] you have seen God.
[2:12:53] Amen.
[2:12:56] That's the mystery.
[2:13:04] Glorious God.
[2:13:10] The prophecies
[2:13:14] men in the beginning. He was made a go
[2:13:20] in the beginning. When he was made,
[2:13:25] a man is a god.
[2:13:32] Oh, give me an
[2:13:33] amen. Amen. at the balcony. Give me an
[2:13:37] amen. Then
[2:13:40] touch your neighbor like this. Just like
[2:13:41] this. Say you are God.
[2:13:49] In in the
[2:13:50] beginning, you
[2:13:55] because if you say pastor say oh no you
[2:13:57] are making him go for you.
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:00] [Laughter]
[2:14:03] [Applause]
[2:14:07] Oh, you are making him
[2:14:09] God. In the
[2:14:11] beginning, each
[2:14:13] man was God.
[2:14:17] Amen. And when the seals were
[2:14:21] open, that man was brought back to what
[2:14:24] he
[2:14:27] was.
[2:14:29] God. Amen.
[2:14:32] [Applause]
[2:14:34] I'm God.
[2:14:37] Amen.
[2:14:39] Pastor is God.
[2:14:42] Pastor Amen. Brother is
[2:14:46] God. This church is a wonderful
[2:14:49] [Applause]
[2:14:54] church. You see what I'm preaching here?
[2:14:57] I can't preach it anywhere else.
[2:15:01] They will chase me out.
[2:15:09] But it's written
[2:15:10] [Applause]
[2:15:12] there. The prophet said
[2:15:14] that man in the beginning when he was
[2:15:20] made a man is a
[2:15:24] god. The prophet says he's
[2:15:28] absolutely a god.
[2:15:33] [Applause]
[2:15:39] You know those who put it on the books,
[2:15:41] they put a little G
[2:15:43] there. But the prophet didn't say
[2:15:50] that
[2:15:54] [Laughter]
[2:15:56] God was
[2:15:59] God.
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:03] Absolutely. A
[2:16:05] god. For he was made in the
[2:16:12] image of God.
[2:16:14] [Applause]
[2:16:16] Being a son of God,
[2:16:20] then he's an
[2:16:23] of all that God
[2:16:27] [Applause]
[2:16:33] is. Not only what God
[2:16:38] has, but what God
[2:16:41] is.
[2:16:45] His is stronger than
[2:16:54] because when you are
[2:16:56] being you possess
[2:17:05] everything. Amen.
[2:17:09] God can heal the sick.
[2:17:12] Men can
[2:17:14] heal. God can create.
[2:17:18] Men can
[2:17:19] create because a man was a
[2:17:26] to
[2:17:27] all that God
[2:17:34] is. Amen. Amen. Then he
[2:17:39] fell. Then he fell.
[2:17:45] The man was a boss
[2:17:50] here. The prophet says when God created
[2:17:57] me, he said I God will be the God of the
[2:18:02] universe.
[2:18:05] you you going to be the God of this
[2:18:12] earth. And when Adam was naming the
[2:18:19] creators, he did not
[2:18:22] pray to look for the will of
[2:18:25] God. What he said,
[2:18:29] God say
[2:18:30] amen. Amen.
[2:18:33] That was what you
[2:18:38] were. I I I came here to remind
[2:18:43] you from where you
[2:18:45] fell so that
[2:18:47] today you can
[2:18:54] repossess. Amen.
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:18:58] Yesterday I was I was talking with
[2:19:00] Pastor
[2:19:03] He was saying me if I have a problem I
[2:19:07] just speak to God like I speak to
[2:19:10] [Applause]
[2:19:12] you that's where you must come now you
[2:19:15] must become
[2:19:18] this
[2:19:20] Pentecostal we are not Pentecostal
[2:19:23] people making a lot of noise oh
[2:19:29] Jesus you have been Power given
[2:19:33] power. If you have a
[2:19:35] problem, don't
[2:19:38] cry.
[2:19:42] Speak. You are
[2:19:44] God.
[2:19:47] Absolutely. When the sins are
[2:19:50] broken, you are put
[2:19:53] back what you
[2:19:55] were and you were gone.
[2:19:58] Today you are
[2:20:04] God. I don't
[2:20:07] cry. I
[2:20:10] speak and the devil know who I
[2:20:14] am. I am a son of
[2:20:18] God. And the devil knows
[2:20:21] me. And the devil knows you.
[2:20:25] You are a son and daughter of God.
[2:20:29] speak.
[2:20:30] [Applause]
[2:20:35] When men fail,
[2:20:38] then Jesus came.
[2:20:42] Jesus was not a son of Adam.
[2:20:48] Adam f.
[2:20:51] We are the sons of Adam.
[2:20:55] The earth was given to Adam's son.
[2:21:01] Jesus was
[2:21:03] God. He came to rescue
[2:21:10] Adam because the law of God is to find a
[2:21:16] kingsman
[2:21:20] redeemer. God became a man.
[2:21:24] So that men who become
[2:21:32] God. Amen. And you know in the
[2:21:35] churches all of the
[2:21:37] preachers every Sunday they repeat to
[2:21:41] the people God become a man Jesus
[2:21:44] Christ. God become a man. Why they
[2:21:48] forget the very
[2:21:51] reason for God become a man? They
[2:21:56] prophesy. God become a
[2:21:59] man so that the man could become a
[2:22:05] god.
[2:22:08] Amen. Today I won't preach you the God
[2:22:12] who become a man.
[2:22:16] I come today to preach you the men who
[2:22:19] become
[2:22:23] God.
[2:22:27] Amen. That's why when Jesus came I I
[2:22:30] love this
[2:22:31] story. When Jesus came, it was just a
[2:22:36] temporary help from heaven.
[2:22:40] God become a
[2:22:43] man just for to fulfill the kinsman
[2:22:47] within the
[2:22:50] world. But he could not stay here
[2:22:55] forever. No, he came to redeem
[2:23:02] you. And when the redemption work is
[2:23:07] over, that's the interesting part. Now
[2:23:11] when the redemption work of Jesus is
[2:23:15] done,
[2:23:16] Jesus must leave that
[2:23:20] spot and take the man to
[2:23:25] bring that very moment to walk.
[2:23:33] You know there is a
[2:23:35] spot, a special
[2:23:38] spot where God meet
[2:23:43] Adam that's that's a a God given place
[2:23:47] of
[2:23:50] worship and at that place God can find
[2:23:55] Adam
[2:23:58] anytime anywhere.
[2:24:01] and he sees
[2:24:03] him when Adam
[2:24:06] fell he just it was taken out of that
[2:24:10] place that's why when God came
[2:24:14] down
[2:24:20] Adam then he came himself at that spot
[2:24:26] to pay the price of your sin
[2:24:30] because Jesus was the owner blood of
[2:24:34] God.
[2:24:37] No one could do
[2:24:38] that but God
[2:24:40] himself. And when the redemption work is
[2:24:46] over, God left that
[2:24:50] peace. The Bible, the prophet says when
[2:24:54] the seas were
[2:24:55] open, the redemption working was over
[2:25:00] and the lamb of
[2:25:01] God left to the redemption
[2:25:06] book, that
[2:25:09] box of redemption. Then he took the
[2:25:14] man, brought him back to that
[2:25:18] place. This is a Shiloh.
[2:25:21] Shiloh. Amen.
[2:25:26] He to whom it belongs.
[2:25:34] This place belongs to
[2:25:37] Adam. Adam was the son of
[2:25:41] God. Adam was absolutely God.
[2:25:49] Even God said to
[2:25:51] Adam, he said, "Reign.
[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:25:57] This is your your your
[2:26:01] domain. Do what you
[2:26:04] want. Dig the soil. Do
[2:26:07] everything. I am the God of
[2:26:11] universe. You are the
[2:26:14] Shiloh. Shiloh.
[2:26:17] to whom it
[2:26:20] belongs. But the lion of
[2:26:24] Judah will be standing at that
[2:26:28] spot until the
[2:26:34] [Applause]
[2:26:36] Shiloh Jesus. Let's read this.
[2:26:40] Let's finish this. The prophet
[2:26:42] says, "And man was given a
[2:26:49] do and the do was the earth,
[2:26:54] not South Africa. The earth is in South
[2:26:58] Africa,
[2:26:59] America, Europe, Europe,
[2:27:03] Tanzania, Australia, Canada, Canada is
[2:27:06] your domain."
[2:27:09] Say amen, please. Amen.
[2:27:15] That's why when I want to go somewhere,
[2:27:17] I just
[2:27:20] go. I always tell my
[2:27:23] church. I took it from
[2:27:26] pastor. He always told me, "You don't
[2:27:29] need money to
[2:27:31] [Applause]
[2:27:34] travel. You need faith.
[2:27:37] [Music]
[2:27:37] [Applause]
[2:27:40] If I want to go anywhere, I go.
[2:27:44] The first time I went to to America,
[2:27:47] it was on 2010 2010. We were 20 pastors.
[2:27:52] I was the only one to be given the visa.
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:28:04] All they didn't know who they were.
[2:28:10] America is a part of the
[2:28:13] earth and that's on my
[2:28:16] [Applause]
[2:28:20] do when I was going to that man that
[2:28:23] counel I don't know you call it in
[2:28:25] English that man who put the
[2:28:31] I came to him
[2:28:34] looking at him like this say where are
[2:28:37] you going I I I go to America
[2:28:40] to do what? To say I have a conference
[2:28:41] there.
[2:28:43] What city? I say Pennsylvania.
[2:28:49] [Applause]
[2:28:49] [Laughter]
[2:28:50] [Applause]
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:56] who you
[2:28:58] [Applause]
[2:29:00] are. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, I have a I
[2:29:04] want I don't have a
[2:29:06] job. I'm
[2:29:09] sick. Now, you know nowadays, you are
[2:29:12] just you you even call the pastor for
[2:29:15] tooth
[2:29:19] ache. That that's what makes him sick.
[2:29:25] Just imagine praying for your tooth
[2:29:27] ache,
[2:29:32] backachche. You are
[2:29:36] God.
[2:29:40] Speak. Amen.
[2:29:47] You are the Shiloh. Shiloh.
[2:29:51] It belongs to you.
[2:29:53] The earth belongs to
[2:29:55] you. The authority belongs to
[2:30:00] you. The
[2:30:03] prophet he said you have
[2:30:07] power over the
[2:30:10] fishes over the falls of the
[2:30:13] earth over everything.
[2:30:17] Say amen. Amen.
[2:30:21] Amen means beat unto me.
[2:30:28] Power over
[2:30:30] everything. The prophecy he could just
[2:30:34] speak
[2:30:36] and everything obeyed
[2:30:42] him.
[2:30:44] Why?
[2:30:45] Because
[2:30:47] he was
[2:30:50] God
[2:30:53] within himself.
[2:30:57] [Applause]
[2:30:59] You are
[2:31:00] God
[2:31:02] within yourself.
[2:31:04] [Applause]
[2:31:06] Everything that happened to you out
[2:31:10] here is
[2:31:12] controlled by what is being inside of
[2:31:15] you.
[2:31:17] [Applause]
[2:31:20] If you are not you're not well or okay
[2:31:23] with what is around
[2:31:27] you, speak from within
[2:31:31] yourself to change the condition and the
[2:31:36] environment because you are God inside
[2:31:41] of
[2:31:42] you. Amen. That's the difference
[2:31:45] between put it the difference
[2:31:49] between says
[2:31:52] and everything else God within himself
[2:31:55] not
[2:31:58] universal. Amen. When you say when we
[2:32:01] say that we are
[2:32:03] God that's not
[2:32:06] means the heaven and
[2:32:09] earth that's not we are
[2:32:12] saying God is still God in the
[2:32:18] universe the same God from the
[2:32:21] universe made out of you a god of the
[2:32:26] earth god of
[2:32:28] universe lives inside of
[2:32:32] you.
[2:32:34] Christ in you, the hope of
[2:32:39] [Applause]
[2:32:41] glory. That's the biggest of all the
[2:32:47] mysteries. He says because he was God
[2:32:52] within
[2:32:53] himself, not invers
[2:32:56] God, but I mean
[2:33:01] the God of heavens and the
[2:33:05] earth. But he the man was a
[2:33:12] ruler in his
[2:33:15] man. Amen. You see, you cannot rule the
[2:33:21] universe, but as long as you are
[2:33:24] here, God wants you to be the
[2:33:31] ruler. Jesus was the ruler until the
[2:33:34] Shiloh came.
[2:33:40] That's why when Jesus finished his
[2:33:43] work, he said to his
[2:33:46] disciples, "I came from
[2:33:49] God and I now return to
[2:33:53] God. It's in the
[2:33:55] Bible. I I I won't I won't be
[2:33:59] here ruling with
[2:34:02] you, but all the power that was given to
[2:34:06] me, I give to you.
[2:34:10] Oh, say amen.
[2:34:14] People who that believes in
[2:34:17] me the works that I was doing, he will
[2:34:21] you will do
[2:34:23] also it's written in your
[2:34:27] Bible because you are the
[2:34:30] sh to whom it belongs.
[2:34:35] The Bible says but he was a
[2:34:39] ruler in his
[2:34:41] domain. He was a
[2:34:43] king. Hallelujah. A king
[2:34:47] ruler. That was
[2:34:50] you. And redemption means you are back
[2:34:54] to that
[2:34:58] again. Amen.
[2:35:01] I always told I always tell my my my
[2:35:05] church I don't believe on those long
[2:35:08] night
[2:35:11] praying prayers to have to have a wake.
[2:35:16] No, if I need a word, I speak the way.
[2:35:21] I'm a ruler.
[2:35:23] [Applause]
[2:35:25] This
[2:35:26] manager manager who is there the boss
[2:35:29] there he's working on my
[2:35:33] domain he's working on my
[2:35:36] do I have the right to speak to him
[2:35:40] inside of
[2:35:42] him no talking I
[2:35:46] command from inside of me I
[2:35:51] command and in the morning I come to
[2:35:55] him and then I will be given that
[2:35:59] job because the inside of him knows who
[2:36:03] is inside of
[2:36:06] me. For him that is in
[2:36:09] me is
[2:36:11] greater. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:15] Amen.
[2:36:18] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:36:20] The prophet
[2:36:22] continues. Hallelujah. Amen. He say and
[2:36:24] even
[2:36:25] now in his fallen
[2:36:31] state man has that appearance.
[2:36:37] Even when you are
[2:36:39] fallen, you still have that
[2:36:43] appear of a king.
[2:36:47] That's why. Amen. I don't believe on
[2:36:50] people coming to church in
[2:36:56] shades. What appearance are you
[2:37:00] giving? You are a
[2:37:04] ruler. Put your suit

[2:37:36] Church I give you my example
[2:37:40] myself. I don't have money but people
[2:37:44] always think that I have money.
[2:37:50] In consequence, no one give me
[2:37:55] money. They all come asking for
[2:37:59] money. Please don't do that
[2:38:03] [Laughter]
[2:38:10] here. It's just inside of me.
[2:38:14] I came to realize
[2:38:18] I am a ruler.
[2:38:20] I am a king. I
[2:38:23] cannot lack
[2:38:27] anything. Everything comes from your
[2:38:34] inner. Amen. Amen. Hey, let me close
[2:38:37] here.
[2:38:39] Let me close here. Amen. You know where
[2:38:41] the
[2:38:45] seas were open?
[2:38:48] Let's go back to what we were reading
[2:38:52] and we stop just there. The bridge
[2:38:56] between the seven churches the bridge
[2:38:59] that is and the seven
[2:39:05] the prophet says now you see I'm just
[2:39:08] not making that up.
[2:39:12] That's what it does, say the
[2:39:18] Lord. Amen.
[2:39:20] I read to you out of the
[2:39:24] book the sounding of the seventh angel
[2:39:32] message mystery that God should
[2:39:37] be declared by
[2:39:42] his because the word you must be a
[2:39:46] [Music]
[2:39:47] prophet and
[2:39:50] in this time came to us in the form of a
[2:39:56] prophet which means the son
[2:40:00] of a son of man. You see that's the
[2:40:04] prophet who has wrote the
[2:40:08] wording of the seven
[2:40:11] churches
[2:40:14] [Music]
[2:40:31] churches you know inside that book of
[2:40:36] seals. The mystery that was
[2:40:40] inside was the mystery of who Christ
[2:40:45] is. Christ
[2:40:47] is the
[2:40:52] child because when the sins were open,
[2:40:57] Christ appeared
[2:40:59] and Christ is the man.
[2:41:04] all belong.
[2:41:12] So when you
[2:41:15] don't just You must be
[2:41:20] my do anything
[2:41:26] [Music]
[2:41:34] with the coming of the road.
[2:41:43] in
[2:41:48] your English. In English, you call those
[2:41:51] who are in that domain land load.
[2:41:57] land.
[2:42:00] You are
[2:42:05] land
[2:42:08] of a son of God is a
[2:42:15] language. Amen.
[2:42:22] He said, "And when the
[2:42:32] separ and the
[2:42:34] mystery is
[2:42:37] revealed, comes the angel."
[2:42:41] Hallelujah. Amen. The
[2:42:44] messenger. Hallelujah.
[2:42:50] The
[2:42:52] saints were holding
[2:42:57] Christ
[2:43:13] my but in
[2:43:30] Because
[2:43:34] [Music]
[2:43:36] that the mystery is revealed.
[2:43:43] We would like to see
[2:43:46] Jesus and the prophet says everyone of
[2:43:50] son of God who the name are written in
[2:43:53] the
[2:43:56] book when the book is
[2:43:59] open they become him.
[2:44:11] You are the coming of Jesus
[2:44:21] coming and the prophet
[2:44:24] said God has never left
[2:44:31] here. He said because if God leaves the
[2:44:34] earth
[2:44:36] weekends.
[2:44:39] But he's descended.
[2:44:47] Even Jesus when he was walking he said
[2:44:49] no one has descended but the unrecending
[2:44:52] the
[2:45:03] inal prophet says to
[2:45:07] descend means to change your f
[2:45:14] To be sent means changing
[2:45:19] the from the
[2:45:22] spiritual to the
[2:45:27] fleshing. When the spirit
[2:45:31] live into a human
[2:45:33] being, it's a lower condition.
[2:45:37] That means
[2:45:44] descender when it
[2:45:46] get to
[2:45:50] and the Bible say I saw Jesus coming
[2:45:53] down.
[2:46:03] That's how many people look at you.
[2:46:07] He lies to
[2:46:08] me yesterday. He lies to
[2:46:11] me. He's told me
[2:46:14] money. But he's still
[2:46:18] God. He's still
[2:46:21] God. He lied to you yesterday.
[2:46:25] God because God is the one living
[2:46:30] inside and from inside that God will
[2:46:34] tell him to go and
[2:46:42] confess
[2:46:47] right from the
[2:46:49] inside. You never need someone outside
[2:46:54] to let you know
[2:46:57] that you must obey the word of
[2:46:59] God because the word of God is inside of
[2:47:03] you.
[2:47:06] [Applause]
[2:47:09] Amen.
[2:47:11] Amen.
[2:47:13] The prophet continues and we close
[2:47:17] here and
[2:47:20] When the seas are open and the
[2:47:25] revealed, thou come the angel,
[2:47:29] the
[2:47:30] messenger Christ setting his foot upon
[2:47:34] the
[2:47:37] sea. You see, when the clouds
[2:47:40] came, the angel, seven angels,
[2:47:45] they get into the prophet.
[2:47:49] Yes. Get into the prophets.
[2:47:53] That's
[2:47:55] the most powerful
[2:47:59] gets into a man flesh and
[2:48:02] blood and that makes him
[2:48:06] be an
[2:48:09] angel. But that God of living in
[2:48:14] him. You see that?
[2:48:17] Now remember he said that angel is on
[2:48:20] earth at the time of his
[2:48:26] coming this
[2:48:30] coming. You see if you don't see him
[2:48:34] coming you won't go to meet him in the
[2:48:38] air. That's how it works. He has come to
[2:48:43] you then he will go with
[2:48:51] you to God.

[3:09:18] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[3:09:21] shall we do?" Peter said unto them,
[3:09:24] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:09:26] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:09:29] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:09:31] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
