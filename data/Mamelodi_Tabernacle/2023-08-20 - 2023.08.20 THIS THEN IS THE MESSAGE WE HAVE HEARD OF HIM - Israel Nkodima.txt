Description:
Title:This Then Is The Message Which We Have Heard Of Him.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 20-08-2023  at Gqeberha 

I John 1: 1-5
Genesis 19:27
Revelation 4:1,  21:10, 16:12 , 12:12 , and 19:11

The purpose of this sermon was to to show the audience about the messages which we have heard of Him. 

The Bride is the Word  in the Word. The Word is preached to the word.

The  Revelation is the Word not the Quotation. The message didn’t start when it was preached by Prophet Branham , it started before time.  The battle started beyond time and it will end beyond time. 

Enock pleased God to the point that God took him. In order to be Raptured you need to please God. 

The Bride  can not be separated as it is one bride of Christ. The bride is called out of the Churches and it doesn’t differ from one another. 

When you look at Jesus you will not worry about your problems. When Peter saw Jesus walking upon the water , he knew that he can do the same .

Standing in the Gap, is the Gap that was left by Adam, which was between God and Men. 

The Prophet was brought East to open  the Seventh Seals for God. 

The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

63-0302E The Seventh Seal Par 64, and 537

63-0623M Standing in the Gap par 80

my brother here brother foreign [Music] father God we just already feel that atmosphere the Heavenly atmosphere causes um you cannot hear the uh the the Revelation if you are not a revelation because our theophan is buses [Music] there is a pride of Christ there's a message where we belong this morning Father God May will come down and take control bless our pastor bless our interpreter bless your Church Father God come take control in everything that is here in Jesus name we pray amen uh we may be seated God bless you and I have my Bible please okay so glad to be here again this morning with the Saints amen amen we are all here to worship God thank you sir that which we have heard since the seventh seal was revealed as it was revealed as you know the prophet says it was revealed in a three-fold Mysteries and maybe we we all know what it means free food mystery means amen amen can we go back and foreign uh we were the pride of Christ has revealed yeah the seventh seals shall be revealed around the time the Lord Jesus Will appears this is what he says on Earth again um I'm going to read something here The Bride is the word um that's why there's no confusion with the bride of Christ because the bread of Christ foreign [Music] amen amen now because he hasn't come to start a new thing oh man he's still dealing with those beings those spirits that were with him before the foundation of the world that there's no confusion all right amen now I'm going we are going to look into the world and see what he has for us today we I want to thank him for being with us okay amen this morning I believe that we are not here to repeat things as we start from back there amen amen now in the beginning was the word now if we are going to look at that which was the new things the ministry of the pride it's not a new ministry it is it was them from the beginning that's why there's no confusion in the bride of Christ amen amen we don't have meetings to try to resolve things the meeting that we have is with him yeah and if we are receiving from him we are receiving the very same way which we have it from him from the beginning in the beginning was the way all right so I'm going to read some things I I won't belong um even if the wrist watch gives me more time here all right now yesterday we looked at that part where it speaks of like the battle of Armageddon things like this and which brother Branham says that battle started way back and Beyond Time I asked a question yesterday [Music] have you ever hit somebody talking about or preaching about the Battle foreign oh no right but is there somebody who spoke or I preached that subject but otherwise you have never heard from any other person preaching about the battle of Armageddon is uh I was asking a brother while we are repeating things we can preach the message that was preached I mean maybe to remind ourselves and so forth but things like the battle of Armageddon it seems like no one is trying to touch that I'll tell you why because brother Brendan says is [Music] he says way back Beyond time now if we were we we are going to see things that are Beyond time that would be that what that would mean the things that are Beyond time we're seen Beyond Time let me put it in the right way the battle that started I read way back Beyond time yeah so you have Beyond time and you have Beyond time let us put it in this way from Beyond Time and so now why are the two changes our in progress it was a time but this seven Church ages we are no longer in the seven churches Ministry has changed because seven churches but when you come to the seventh then you are going Beyond time now I think that is beyond time can be seen then over this this time which is which is ages maybe I'm going to let me read here the battle that started way back Beyond Time back before Before Time started or beginning and it says then it is Satan and disease and then they they came to the earth and the battle set at okay I will stop there okay now I'm saying uh I've never seen or read from somebody repeating this it was started Beyond time all right now you will understand that today there's so much confusion in the world like this threefold revelation of God the threefold is cod tells you here it is [Music] Utica the logos logos if I go back to the Cod now we've got it like this logos logos amen amen now that is that but these things are only understood amen by this threefold Revelations now why threefold God logos the men now if he says he says the 16 th did you understand that's revealed in a three-fold then he said the seventh seals was also revealed threefold now threefold meaning now if the bride is part of the threefold is part of the word of God in the third food that's why he speaks of the uh the pools um everybody's wondering what is the third pool because everything is comes in three now if you looking at these pools you'll find brother brand name is even if I read from a book here about this let's try to look into these things this is okay now if it was fought Beyond time as the prophet says even that would feel finished uh this he says now we find that the six seal once might you understand that has been opened fully well to us then if you ask what is the sixth year oh yeah that is Moses and Elijah Moses that is the sixth series now we are on is winning yeah amen amen now now the whole world is full of preachers that's the difference from just being a church that's why I'm speaking not to a child speaking to the bride because we have so many churches with different doctrines the word of God Elizabeth it is not revealed it is the word of God now so if we you come here into something without conclusion it is revealed it is now which one is amen [Music] now what we must receive okay we must see the word of God from the people you see a cities before the foundation of the world know whether it is has been opened to us we see it what what do we see Moses in the revelation of that sixth seal this is referring to the Jews in open open to us we see it amen amen and we know that fiasba these seven and not be broke to the public foreign [Applause] that is the bride of Christ amen amen and right now I'm looking at this um it is open to us we see it and we know that the seventh yeah cannot be broke to the public until that hour all right so then he continued so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore is not yet for the mystery to be known as he is referring to the seventh seal hotel that cannot be broke to the public what is the public yeah I mean you have the public and you have the price that's the difference is all the churches so to them it is then he continues when the seventh sea when when he opened the seventh sealed I mean he's been there but now opened the seventh it says eating he also omitted it again so we see that it is a complete mystery [Music] right around about the time that Jesus appears on the earth so he said it will be this mystery be known right about malunga the time that the Lord Jesus again for his for his bride appears for his brothers or whatever takes place [Music] Christ through uh Satan holds the Beast also has three and a half years we call tribulation period yes it is now what is left now that three and a half years [Applause] did you know where we are now what is coming now to the world so because the Rapture please don't take in place yet the Rapture is coming very very very soon we have seen all these signs leading to the Rapture of the price we have the three and a half years of the Lord Jesus Christ the last one is the three and a half years of Satan both Ministries then uh when is it coming when it is coming is a needy already if we look at the signs uh the people are standing up against the Lord Jesus Christ in America America some people were arrested for preaching Christ too and that's why they say America America is a [Music] um children can change [Music] foreign Genesis chapter 19 from verse 27 God bless you and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plane and beheld and low the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace up in for the Lord do you hear the scripture like us we stood before the Lord goes way back let's talk about predestination now we stood before the Lord that's why even today to see these things we have taken our positions [Music] we have seen before the foundation because the true bread of Christ is this before the foundation that's why we don't go to study in order we are receiving we have received a revelation foreign foreign it's not some new Souls of those who were with him for the foundation of the world did not send a new camera [Applause] not use a new camera no if he sent out to somebody he was sent out from the be from before the beginning because the message yesterday [Applause] it can only be scientific but there's another body within a body Chico not scientific this is the word of God so now this is what we are looking at um why because they believe that they are educated but now we don't need the ministry of an educated man it doesn't come through education it is [Applause] now we have the last we don't have the last three and we have eternal life okay now I'm going to read something here what the Bible says is that a Revelation chapter four do you know where we are now yeah all right we are not in a church age Revelation chapter four verse one day after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be here all

show Thee the bright the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem sending out of Heaven from God foreign amen you know brother Branham tells me that um is built she's she she is in the form of a pyramid pyramid a man pyramid okay now that's why now God shaped it like that okay come up here from the church ages I

are going in the rapture did you know that we asked London if you are going in the Rapture oh yeah you know who yes because brother Brennan says [Applause] okay the rapture I can say you two can say that thank you so much in US the things of the world are behind me I've taken off the things of the world in order to put on the Rapture in faith foreign uh [Music] are a child of God foreign foreign yes hated his brother foreign just because the brother was righteous now hatred comes into this way to act like he wanted to convince is he who hates his brother I remember of a brother I was told um um you know I just smile and pray for the brother to me he still remained my brother then after that I think in two weeks or three weeks after that so I saw the brother I was happy for you so then when he saw me I'm born and Caesar he was trying to go that way and I said brother come my brother he is I said God bless you brother yes I am how's the children he expected me to say why you say I've got it I wouldn't say that again I freed him from that bondage then we were talking there all day at the wedding there just in my heart there was that desire to help my brother because it is the devil who said okay now rapturing without death before we go without death it is happening with us now a rapturing yeah one day okay now rupturing without death I don't know about you and I think I was thinking about death I'm thinking about the rapture that is what is in my my heart medicine is [Music] that is with me night night when we shall meet in the air when meaning [Music] the the things are preaching it says I'll say that what we are looking at now for the world tribulations already the science of the tribulation are already with the world now there's only one two left now he is the three and a half years it is in the Bible chapter 13 of the revelations all right I mean he was given that time foreign we spoke you have heard about this the rupturing with without death okay and then no one will teach you about it is then it says it's rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age now the seventh Church age we're talking about rapturing in the other ages they were preaching the Rapture is coming but the servants [Applause] if you know what rapturing means Elijah he started knowing that is us there's a foreign uh if I move some people who are talking about the future in two years I want to take my child to England to do what what for five years I'm not saying you are doing wrong that is in you within your eyes you can see this [Music] the wife she won't allow he won't allow his wife the river um while we were looking at the river Euphrates some people don't care about these things but to us it is in the Bible that when you see the river Euphrates opening the way for the king of the East become a road now as it is drying up is becoming a way and the Bible says where do you find it in the Bible yes and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared all right amen now since this coming what we call you know what is what we call now before tribulation this coming this battle of coconut milk they interpret this in this way they say Grog like that is some interpreted in another way Prince and his and they look at the Ukraine and Russia Russia and the Ukraine but that is coming after the Rapture he must first take his wife out before this trouble I've been going around trying to talk to the people about this terrible time that is coming now to talk about tribulation did you know that we are talking about a terrible time yeah right now they go back to their River you Francis it is no more no longer a river now it is from that place now they find that there's some tunnels and what else and they hear some voices crying out some places in torments from those tunnels okay amen and because there's this demon fallen angels that way cast now let me repeat to you that tells me um these demons yes demon they killed the Jews [Applause] in the form of the Soul German soldiers amen did you understand last time we were where's the place now where we were in Congo then Satan attacked um the witnesses brother my city he was close to me and uh actually they were trying to strangle some three children you know these people of money rituals it was the money and now today in the world people want money and now they they they they go through this money rituals if you go and say you if you want money money then he will say without you get me a social child and you know there are things here before I close here there was a little girl she came to my house yes I've got witnesses to that to tell me about their stories how he said [Music] she she used to take us to the see oh you know what the sea he has a laundry The Hiding Place uh then I asked him do you know Satan then she said yes I said that how is he he said no he changes and then sometimes one leg is of a goat and the other one is so far even in his face sometimes he covers his face not trying to let me not mention some names get engaged in some meetings all right maybe you don't know about this now the people just know Satan as a spirit but these people how about you they even hold meetings I'm trying not to name anything of these things now they meet him in person so there's one with a big following one man and you know with a big following he also operates from down there now you can see that to some other people I've tried to talk to a certain man of God and he told me that there's no such a thing because he will get drowned and I said that but the Bible Revelation 13. says the Beast came out all day that that was not a lion yeah it was referring to yeah I mean and so but you said I I don't believe in those things you know we are blessed this is because we know Satan and uh know your enemies [Music] yeah uh god um has given us what's the there the knowledge even to know our enemies you know when I said money love us I think is yesterday I'm referring the people I know they are in love with money and I know the Love of Money leads to lies because the money lover is a liar oh we don't mention things as his business if we were allowed even yesterday I would but we are not allowed to point out the people okay money loversed oh my God okay now under the sea plants there's things there in the Bible everybody will talk about it one day just remind me my friends around God said to even to Moses Moses and go through there foreign and people said he will get drowned but upon the house so we just leave it like this I just say God bless you but the Beast shall come out of the City why the Beast will slow down the Bible speaks I will read to you about all those kings and so forth those who operated from the sea yes it is in the Bible he said I believe amen you know we know challenges from there when we go to sleep amen but if you are a child of God they will do you nothing they won't do anything because foreign and uh even lastly I was trying to find that girl to help it is when we come together did you know that where's London even in the Bible believe the sons of God came together Saturn would also appears yeah until God says what about you we're now turning away amen he recognized him that's why the children of God now I'm trying to say to you this river Euphrates uh they they have heard some songs coming out of them Barbies and yes it is one day will especially speak about this is one of the Great Signs of the entire world now those fallen angels demons now I will repeat again they killed the Jews during the second daughter now some people think that we do are some creatures with some horns it was in the form of the German the Germans but uh these demons anointed in the form of this story soldiers those demons don't you think that do not think that they will come with horns uniform because when the pride goes up from Satan comes down you know that yes London he's being operating the Bible says but in the Heavenly places because in heaven was cast out Revelation chapter 12 12. I'm sorry brother I'm sorry you know even I don't know when was it I continue to say Revelations and uh trying to put me was online Revelation 12.12 but you remember we spoke about this yesterday that if something like that okay you've got you can write on a paper this is revelation 12. with 0 12 yeah that would not be like to undermine if I'm a pastor it happened even in Congo recently I said that feeling and people were just looking at me you get what I mean somebody rituals uh foreign I know of the people foreign all right that's right I mean okay now I want to finish up with you God has given us that in order who goes there to fight still Soldier is trained and a soldier will undergo a training he is the are put on a training I mean to train him to know the enemy you can't fight an enemy you don't know I mean but never never take any brother sister even if he is against you he's not against you ever make her or him your enemies and that's why he says love those who hate you all right amen so that is the life we ought to live now let us finish this one the rapturing that is especially it's a seventh Church age he speaks of the rapturing yeah foreign if you are talking about the future in this world because one future is the Tribulation period one future is the hell itself which future so that's why you know with the bride of Christ in this last age because it is their seventh Church age are in the sixth Dimensions they are also waiting for us to come so we know we are going to meet is going to be a big meeting will be called out of the seven Church age see on the rapturing amen amen without death [Music] I mean without death actually we should like you know we should be now working with with him this opening of the seals amen amen uh it's like Enoch when it was open to him he started working with God right I mean then it says eating now Google it called the prophet calls it that is uh the book of The Rapture page 21 here out of a culture amen and he continues to say I'm chatting without the death will be called out of the seven Church seventh Church which we are now bearing record of that age this is the age that we are presiding in this age now in this age it is Puma so now uh he taught me that things they are suppressed by the presence of the Bride even some of the people can go their way those things are still suppressed they come up now because the Rapture is about to take place you see now these Rivers now those things that are there yes let us repeat they won't come in snakes or lions uh it will be in the form of men too even brother Branham tells you that is Satan comes down you see yeah he will come down and he says what he becomes a king it is we're going to read them these things Satan comes down yes and becomes a key yes and then that's why the Bible says you know the Bible says yeah my yeah Revelation chapter 12 from verse 12. yeah therefore Rejoice ye Heavens any that dwell in them right their brother says he is talking to the Rapture sayings that means that is after the Rapture he says Rejoice you in heaven [Music] therefore Rejoice see heavens and he that dwell in them who to the Inhibitors of the earth and of the sea right the earth and the Sea um foreign foreign for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he has but a short time right Logan when the devil OMG comes down in esperada Freedom says and becomes he is crowned a king at his time amen amen he is a cornered Satani now if his time is short he becomes more terrible even before now the Inhibitors of the Earth who are the Inhibitors of the sea okay foreign [Music] Church age brother is it not referring to you without death capturing means that's what is going to happen right now just like in the days he walked with God amen amen have you ever thought think of such a thing working with God the rapturing faith without death Elijah Elia he started to work who else yeah amen I'm in Elijah well yeah knowing that the Chariot is coming to work the people in this day knowing that the Rapture is coming we started to work yes [Music] they don't have future in this world they have already started to walk with God because [Music] they called out of the seven churches what age is that brother and we are in the sevenths [Music] we all know it now meaning that we in the seventh Church and then he

future which one LEP okay login like I said foreign [Music] [Applause] time is up already we are on the runway Festival rapturing already and then says PT we have seen God's reflection the prophet prophet he is a reflector of God's word but God This is the End Lena the but nobody according to set before a propheti because he was absolutely the word of God and he was the word in his day foreign [Music] amen you have a prophet I mean if you have the prophet then let me close the service if you have a prophet and which is the word of God in a human form too and you you have that Prophet when

divisions okay is now in US closing like this is [Applause] will change into immortality there are people right who are ready to go read this book you know there was a gap because what did he do he left forfeited and God Boutique no came to you and me but of this Prophet what he says is I preach on this but only to realize that the people can't reach this place what is standing in the game it is because foreign who who took the book from the one what happens there was this one on the throne and one came and took the book now the reason this is that the Rapture is so close I to take back the book that's why it says there was no one one who was if if you you you you have a wonderful story when there was no one need to take the book yes it is he acted in this way he he took the book write about English from the one who sat on the throne who is this one who said on the throne within himself I could be waiting now there's one on the throne no electronics no it says it is [Applause] how is that Johnny do you believe it because the first rule he showed us yes was in Missouri running [Applause] amen amen first thrown in heaven in Jesus thank God for the prophets now I know that's why you know the book was in heaven and the book was coming down do you know which book is that yeah there was the one who sat on the throne with the book in his right yeah um I think they are political I say that in Swaziland in Swaziland he says now yes it's not that in Swaziland Swaziland there was a book in the hand if only a right hands of the one that said on Earth I I read yes what what I don't
