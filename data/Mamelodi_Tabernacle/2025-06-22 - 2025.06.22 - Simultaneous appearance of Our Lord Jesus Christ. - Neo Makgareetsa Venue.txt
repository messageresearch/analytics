While we are still on the thanksgivings, we received a testimony. We have Mariah. If she can stand, she has a wonderful testimony. May the Lord richly bless you, mama. Amen.

Amen. Am I right? No, she was then. Yes. She became after the wedding. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So before that wedding, the daughter brought the matter of her mother to the attention of the pastor. And she was on a wheelchair and there was no hope that she will ever walk again. And the doctors also told her there's nothing we can do. So the pastor commissioned our elder. They visited our mother. They prayed with her and they advised her to stream to stream every service and to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will heal her and our mother can walk now. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She is a living testimony that the Lord Jesus Christ answer our prayers. Amen. Amen. Amen. And she's going to be baptized today. Amen. That's wonderful. and you'd like to have a shepherd. Amen. Just a commission from the Lord Jesus Christ to the pastor to the elder and our mother is here. Amen. Amen. And today we have others that are also going to be baptized. We have sister Mary Manala from Davidton. Marya from David. Davidton. If our sister can stand. Ah on my right. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you my sister. The baptism will be just after the service after the preaching of the word. Amen. Amen. We have visitors among us. All our visitors feel at home. Some they fellowship with us. they stream all the services but whenever they are here we just want to acknowledge them so I'm going to ask them to stand we have sister Cindiu from KZN we have brother Bongani Masoka brother and we have sister well we have seen Sister Mary already. So our brother is at the balcony there. May the Lord richly bless you. Amen. Amen. Where's our sister? Sister Cindi. Sister Cinder. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Um, every time she comes to she's always in the church. May the Lord richly bless her. Amen. Amen. We have the upcoming events. We have the wedding celebration of Sister Hana. That will be on the 2nd of August. It will be in Malawi. Malawi. We are all invited. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I believe we also have greetings from our elders. Can you read the greeting from our elder? Uh we've got from one from brother from Elder Raid Gabrielson. Good morning dear saints. God now God bless Mame Loi Church and our precious I think our precious pastor bless you today. Amen. Amen. Amen. Can we say God bless you Elder Reed? God bless you elder. And God bless you, Elder Larry Mims. And God bless you, Elder Larry. Amen. Amen. We have believers that were baptized from inang. So you can see them there. That's our brother being baptized. And that's our sister being baptized. So they are from inang. Oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. I have an announcement here and it comes from the community leader [Music] and is a complaint. [Music] It's a complaint about us especially related to the parking of cars. The pastor always say we must love our neighbors. Love the community that is accommodating us. [Music] and respect them. But unfortunately, some are not doing that. They block their gates. Some they park around the bottle store there and they block even the gates. When the delivery truck comes, they have a struggle to deliver because cars are surrounding the area. Some they have exchanged ugly words with the community. It's unfortunate. Last week when they brought the complaint they were so angry they even wanted to close the church. [Music] They wanted to block the gate with a truck saying the members of this church don't respect them. Some even said to one of the community members, I pay for parking, I can park anywhere. Those are the words that the community leaders are telling us. And you know uh they even quoted the scriptures to say believers are supposed to have the Holy Ghost. But these ones that are troubling us, are they members of your church? That is very sad and that is very bad. Can we respect the community? It will not be nice to find the truck blocking the gate after the service. It will not be nice to see them attacking one of our members. It is not going to be nice. Some that were together with the community leader were saying they want to stop this church from operating because of just few members that disrespect them. So we are requesting that we only have two places where we can park. That is inside the church on the pavement outside. If you can't find parking there, there's a ground on the other side. Just park on the ground. We have somebody that will watch the cars. Let us avoid parking along the road. And the other complaint that they brought they say most of the believers they offload while they are in the road blocking the traffic. And again they say when they are leaving They stop around the next to the bottle store. There's a spasa shop there. They leave the car in the road. They going to the spasa shop and that causing traffic delays. Can we avoid doing that with due respect? Can we say amen to that? Amen. If you know you are guilty, come. The elders will pray for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you know you are guilty, come while grace is available. The elders will advise you and will pray for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know there was a time that the prophet I was praying for someone and when the person came online, the prophet refused to pray for that person. Even the pastor has done that. Even the pastor has done that. Telling a person, I cannot pray for you. go and fix one, two, three. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So let us fix these things so that we can receive all the blessings. May the Lord richly bless you. Amen. Amen. As we stand on our feet to welcome the word of God. And this morning we are blessed. Our precious pastor has commissioned to stand in the gate. May the Lord richly bless our pastor. God bless you. Let us open our heart as we welcome the word. Amen. Amen. When he shall be [Music] to ser [Music] as he has declared to serve. [Music] Behold, I will send you the light shall proess and praise and dwell and he shall [Music] of my brothers to the children and the heart of the children to the father. [Music] Yes, I [Music] th [Music] the earth. [Music] Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost covered with power. [Music] Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. As I greet you this morning in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we want to thank him for protecting us the previous day and the previous night. It's the first day of the week where we are at the right place where we will hear from above. Amen. Amen. So we want to thank God for everything that he has done unto us. Our pastor is not here this morning has explained Lord willing. We will see him next week the Sunday. Amen. Amen. We will pray for that. Amen. So today I'm just standing in the gap to keep the wheel turning. Amen. Amen. So I've got a short message. Yeah. But uh God knows. So before we read the scripture, shall we bow our head and pray? Amen. Gracious and eternal father, our head are bowed down to the earth it came from, but our heart are looking above to thee with our humble heart and desire. We are with great expectation this morning that you should speak to us in a special way. I'm just going to be a vessel. Lord God and the other hand listening to your word as well. You are a good God. You knew the end before the beginning. We are going to read a portion of the scripture and the quote from the prophet and our pastor. So we need your guidance. Lord God, it have everything that is going to be done here should be according to thy will. Amen. Father God, I pray for the entire church. Give them the understanding of the word. Help us to focus in thy word. Lord God, heal all the diseases that may hinder the children of God to see you. I remember the previous couple of funeral I attended, they were cancerous. I remember brother Brennham once upon a time he heard from God when he say when you stay by my word nothing can stand before thee including cancer now I've experienced that the cancer is killing the people today may that disease go back to hell where it belong free the children of God those that are sick this morning can be a cancer can be any chronic condition, the feet that are sore. Heavenly Father, you know better. You have the healing. And the word of God has taught us that when we believe and repent and baptize in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, our sins shall be forgiven. And with your scars in the wound from the cross, all diseases shall be healed. You were never specific, but you said all. We claim the healing this morning Lord God so that everyone should be happy to come to church and listen to the word of God because there was a time when the prophet says the time shall be no more. Now this morning we are not saying that but we say the time is no more. We are right on the verge of rapture. Lord God help us always to align oursel with the word to straighten up our ways so that we may please thee Lord God. We want to thank you Lord God as you are going to read the portion of the scripture. Bless the Bible. Bless the listeners this morning. Bless all that are streaming this morning for you know better Lord God. We appreciate and we put everything unto your capable hand in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's read from the book of Ezekiel chapter 38 verse 1 to5. Ezekiel 38 verse 1-5. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Mog, the chief prince of Mach and Tuba, and prophesy against him, and say, Thus said the Lord God, behold, I'm against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Mach and Tuba, and I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth All and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sort of armor. Even a great company with backlass and shields. All of them handling swords. Persia, Ethopia, and Libya with them. All of them with shields and helmet. Amen. You may be seated. We will come to this scripture but let's read revelation chapter 13 only verse 11 revelation 13 11 and I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. I'm going to talk about this morning the simultaneous appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Uh we are looking at what is happening today. When we look at those things, we check in the Bible and in the spoken word because nothing has just happened. God knows everything. He's part of that things. He saw and they should happen. Be not deceived. Just relax in the word of God. Is God doing everything? Sometimes as human being we normally say let's try harder. But if you try harder but God said no, God said no. It's not about your effort. It's about what God has planned for you. Those that will go to heaven, they will go to heaven irrespective of the condition. Those that are born for damnation, they will go for damnation. There's nothing you can do, a complete job was done. Sometimes as human being, we may think we can do things this way. But God has his own way. I'm going to read the scripture where God says, "I you know God doing it." Amen. Amen. I remember in the book of Exodus, God said to Moses, I God will harden the heart of Is God doing that? So you can stand there and try to fast for him. But God said, "I will harden his heart and I will take my children out and I will bless them. I will give them what they need." God saying I will even today what is happening. God said so. Well, we read two scriptures here. I just want to go straight to this scripture here. It speaks about the land of Mog, the chief prince of Mach and Tub. It's right there in the Old Testament. More than 2,500 years ago, Jesus was born. This was prophesied by Ezekiel. Amen. Amen. Now because we are living in the time of politics that the name change from this name that name us as children of God, we can be able to trace back. We have the prophet. If there's another generation, I don't know if there's another generation, they will be surprised that one time. Do you understand? But when you speak about Amen. So now here the Bible speaks about Gog and Me and the Bible speak about me and Tuba. Those names were in the Old Testament. But where are those names now? Who are these people? Who are this land? The earth has never changed. It remain the earth. But we changed. Amen. Amen. Limpopo used to be those kind of things they changed because of politicians pushing whatever agenda they want. And I want to tell you this morning that when the Bible speaks about Mishak and Tuka, I'm listening to the prophet and looking at the historians living in the area tell you that Mishach and Tub speaks about Russia and China. The prophet said it as well. Amen. Amen. So now what is happening in Mach and Tuba meaning Russia Russia. Amen. Amen. So there were wars and even now as I speak there is war the war against Israel and Iran. Amen. Amen. Now Iran is Persia. You remember in the olden days we had Me and Pesia that invaded Babylon. It's the very same thing today. We have Iran and is those patients those people that the Bible speaks about more than 2,500. Amen. Amen. But those people of the old they are old. They are dead. Now it's new people. But the same spirit the spirit continue. That is why in the church we operate under same spirit of Lord Jesus Christ. The spirit that started with Ephesians and is the same spirit is the same Christ. You can kill the body the spirit but the soul is of God remain intact. What I'm trying to tell you again, the Bible speaks about Israel and this Mishk is is Russia. Well, I was following this warm what is happening globally. I said no. When America is speaking before I go there, we read Revelation 13 11 the Bible just speaks about that and the prophet will explain what is that scripture revelation 131 is America. So here we speak about Russia and America and Israel is right in the midst of we can have wars but once you touch anointed one it bring God's attention. Russia is fighting Ukraine. It's okay. Amen. Amen. If if if Donald Trump Donald Trump is complaining about it's okay if America is complaining about South Africa. It's okay. If America can say is a nonexisting country but the day we speak about Israel touch God. Amen. Amen. For the Bible says Israel is our timeline. If if you want to know where we are, don't look anywhere. Don't look at America or Africa but look at Israel. You will understand where we are. Why there's a war now? Israel. Israel. Amen. Amen. We will look at the spoken worden. Amen. Amen. I'm going to read from the question and answers question and answers. Question and answers was when people asking question to brother they ask the church age. The church age ending had blackout and has blackout. The bride is called We have already entered into the tribulation period. Brother answer, he said, "No, no, no." Amen. Amen. I wish that I could just have more time on that. The bride when she has taken from the church. Remember why why brother is saying that the bride taken from the church. The bride is being taken from the churches like Israel is taken from other nations. for only two things that draw the attention of God is Israel and Abraham. Amen. Then the church age will seize. The church age will come to an end goes into chaos. The bride goes to the glory and the tribulation period set in upon the sleeping vision. Three and a half years. Israel is getting its prophets. Revelation 11. Then tribulation sets in upon Israel. And then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroyed all things and then the bride returned back with the groom for a thousand years. I don't want to go there. I want to focus only on the three and a half years and that's all the white judgment millennia the new city not now I want to focus presently of one let's read chapter 39 of Ezekiel 39 we'll start with verse one going Now I just want to show you what is happening today as per the scriptures as per the codes because this day this scripture is fulfilled. Amen. Amen. Ezekiel 39. Yes. From verse one. Therefore thou son of man prophesy against Gawk and say thus say the Lord God. Behold, I am against thee, oh Gog, the chief prince of Mach and Tuba. And I will turn thee back and leave but six part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel. Amen. Amen. You see where I say God say, I will. Is God doing this? There's nothing that you can do in this world do it. He said, I will turn thee back and leave, but the sixth part of thee will cause thee to come up from the north part and will bring thee upon the mountain. Is God doing this? God, he make Russia to leave north part and I come to the mountain of Israel. For brother Brenham says the king of the north is Russia. He even say I said it several times that watch Russia king of the north. When you are a child of God you don't live just a careless life. You look at Russia. You look at Israel because something needs to happen in the mountain of because the king of Mog and Me from the north being Russia will come in the mountain of Israel. You know when war start it starts so light. I just mentioned few and then if if if I want to start war with you I will check amongst you who can stand on my side then if you realize I'm fighting you start check on your side [Music] amen you know When Russia was invading Ukraine, it was for one reason. When they hit Russia, Ukraine when they hit Russia in the Second World War, Ukraine was the base. Then this time, Russia said no more. you allow NATO in your land deal with you harshly because the the the enemy should find a place nearby to invade you. You remember America wanted to invade Zimbabwe and they wanted a base is next to Zimbabwe. That's what they do. Amen. Amen. Now, Iran being the Pesia is not going along with Israel, but there we see Russia wanting to pass through Persia wanting to pass through the river because it's right there to go to Israel so that they can invade them. But God said, "I allowed it. When I allow Russia to go to Israel, invade my people, they will never go back home." Amen. Amen. I was listening to they interviewed him. He he always quote the scripture. I was listening to Donald Trump when they interview him. He quote the scripture. Amen. Amen. They know the time we are living in. They know is the end of the world. Donald Trump was keeping on saying you are playing with fire. You take us to the world war. The third world war. But they can't control it. God say, "I will do that." Is God doing that? Amen. Amen. When we read Revelation 13:1, this one, this beast from the earth will come like a lamb but speak like a dragon. When Donald Trump is going anywhere, he say I come with peace. When he leave the place, lot of cops on the floor. America went to Iraq. You know, but they couldn't stand even today. America went to Libya. They couldn't stand today in the name of peace. Amen. Amen. When you Israel, start to invade Iran, they asked Donald Trump, "What are you saying?" I said, "Now I come with peace. I'm just I'm not going to kill anyone. I just need to negotiate." But guess what? They just bomb Iran again. And who are they? America. The men of peace. A lamp. Speak like amen. Amen. Now let's read here says God being misunderstood. Amen. Amen. They they ask him a question again. So it's question and answers. Will Ezekiel 38 and39 come to pass before the rapture 389? Brother Abraham said Ezekiel 38 and 39 deal with Gog and M which is Russia the north country and God deals with Gog and when they come down before Israel and I think that after the rapture. This is what I want to show you. Within three and a half years. Amen. Amen. This is what will happen. The rapture will take place. When the rapture takes place, we will be in the air at the wedding supp with our Lord Jesus Christ. At the same time, in that three and a half years, there will be tribulation. At the same time within 3 and 1/2 years, Revelation chapter 11, Moses and Elijah will be in Israel. Israel will be invaded by Russia. But God said, I will deal with the king. Amen. Amen. So I was looking and realized that China has got a lot of troops, more than 2 million soldiers and is the largest army in the world. America does not even go close. But it's not about the big because Russia has got two troops as well, not large as America. But brother Brennham says Russia is the tool to the head of it's not about how big you are. Go and look at the map of Iran. Look at the map of Israel. Israel goes four times in Iran. Israel challenge Iran. It's not about how many troops. It's about what God said. God allowed to provoke Iran because there's no more time when when when Israel got to attack Iran, Russia stood up. When Russia stood up, America says, "We cannot touch the anointed nation of God." Now we see re revelation 13 and 38 coming into action. Hallelujah. Amen. We don't worry much about India. The largest troops after China. You understand? Amen. The first is China. The second is India. Do you understand? Amen. and then America and then Russia, North Korea and then they have all those armies. What is happening is leading us to the third world war is everything is leading us to the war of Armageddon. The war of Armageddon is God himself sweeping the whole world. Amen. Amen. The missiles [Music] that they have will kill all of them. The war of Armageddon, there's no winner because it wiped up everything. But the second world war, Germany was up there. But Russia invaded the German and Hitler was killed. Brother when he talk about Hitler, he said he will die a mysterious death. Amen. Now the people tried to hide this and that. Say this and this. He shot himself in the in the banker. He ran away to another foreign land. Because the prophet says his death will be mystery but at the end of the war was the one took the cup. Brother Brennham says I said there is three isms trying to take a hold of the world today is fascism is nazism is communism and what I say they would all went up communism communism is Russia China can act only if Russia say help me. Those are communist country. Amen. Amen. So now America will check who stand on their side. Russia will check who stand on their side. Those two forces they will come to finish the entire world. Now as I talk Russia and America are like this they are fighting now they haven't start physically they are talking but Israel as small as it is provoked Iran that is supported by Russia at the beginning. Now I just heard you all to repeat over [Music] Keep your eyes on Russia. You remember that? Keep your eyes on Russia. She'll all wind up in communism and then it will all wind up finally in Catholism. Remember, remember it will all wind up communism and not exactly right. That's the battle of Amageddon right over here when Christ comes. Amen. Amen. The World Council of Churches are built in America but by the Romanism The Roman Romanism is the one that had the word cut of churches being the greatest in the sea. It had power to give to the power of in America to have welcome of churches will be the beast of the earth beast out of the earth is like a lamb. Amen. Amen. Now the Russian is there to shoot catalism America but they will be killed or wiped off by God himself. Amen. Amen. So God, you know, when I was following this war, I was listening to the rabbis, [Music] those that are in Jerusalem at the moment the city of Jerusalem safe, but they are hitting Tel Aiv, part of Israel, one of the big city in they are hitting there. So Israelis, they all over the world. Amen. Amen. I was checking once more how did they killed the commanders and the scientists of Iran. They prepare that evening and I was listening to one of the rabbi. He said, "We prepared this started to 2024 in September and they started to trace. But when someone want to assassinate you, it's so easy to plan. Amen. Amen. You leave your home at this time. You put full total. You get to work. You eat your breakfast and lunch. You love to be with they traced them. The Israelis traced them. That evening one time at the same time eliminated them. Amen. Amen. Because Iran is the patient and history tells us how the Iranians lived with the Israel. So the Israel know everything about. Amen. Amen. Now Iran you know hit back to Israel. When it hit back at Israel, America said, "No, you have touched untouchable. We need to act." When they want to act, Russia said, "No, we touch we act." What is that? Amen. It's the end of everything. Amen. Amen. The first seal, brother Brennham says, "What did communism raise up over here in Russia? It just make me sick in my stomach to hear so many preachers about communism and they don't even know what they're crying about. That's right. Amen. Communism ain't nothing. It's a tool in the hand of God to bring revenge upon the earth for the blood. of the saints. That's right. Amen. Amen. Amen. When you trace the life of Israel as a nation because Israel is a nation elected by God. Amen. Amen. He will take them to Egypt. Egypt is here in Africa. He will bring them to Africa. And at the right time, he will take them back to their promised land. And when he take them back, Egypt wanted them to be behind. God himself, he said, I will punish Pharaoh. It's God who's doing that. Amen. You may feel pity for them, but that is the plan of God. And when they go back, casual is behind that time. Israel did not have the troops. Amen. Amen. The only man who saw this world fail was Moses, but God took him to the desert for 40 years drained that thing up. God always wanted to show people that he is the one fighting the battle not our intelligence. You can have the strongest intelligence but when God hit me really hit hard when they crossed the Red Sea the whole troops of the Egyptian you know they all died in the sea. Israel. Israel without the troops. Amen. Amen. Then he allowed Nebuchadnezzar baby to capture them because they sinned against him. But when God hit Babylon is so hard. Amen. Amen. Now today as we are living here, the Bible speaks about Gog and Mag. It speaks about Russia. Russia having the highest intelligence. For Israel to hit them, we need not to have the intelligence. God himself sends. This is what we are living for today. Even this morning there's a lot going we thank God because we have the Bible scriptures we have the spoken word we can read and refer one day Donald Trump said to Britain can you stand against Russia alone I saw the president of Britain prime minister prime minister stubbing because he know he can't stand Russia. Amen. Amen. Because Russia or the communism was just born to be the tool in the hand. That's all. You can do whatever. Even when Trump think of Russia, you think twice. The king thought handwriting on the on the wall handwriting on the wall spoken. The king thought he was safely secure was king you know of Babylon but he didn't know all the time godless nation like Russia. Now remember the prophet was not in Med Persia. The prophet Daniel was in Babylon. The big rock and the roll was going on in Babylon where the revival was going on to where the prophet was was and the message was all time. minutes and the patient are just as godless and heartless as Russia had found a way. They had some scientists too and they had bypassed river Ephro that's why the river I was even reading about it yesterday is drying drying so that this king from the north can use the very same Israel. Amen. Amen. For them to pass through, they have to have agreement with the Iranians. Well, I was checking here. They say an ancient country called Mesopotamia was between Tris and Ephes areas like Syria and Iran. Amen. Amen. Now, Russia need to use that action. When America need to invade Iran to get a place near, Iraq, Iraq, Amen. Amen. And Iraq, Iraq, Amen, is the place where Abraham was born. You see things are just happening there in the Middle East because the Middle East has brought the attention of everybody because it's where the city of God is. Is where the garden of Eden. Now the devil know that is coming to block that. Amen. Amen. You cannot block block God. Amen. Amen. What is happening in this world is something that already God has planned. Can you bring something different? Can you live here and try to build something? that you think is absolute wasting your time. God has done a complete job. If God has done a complete job, there's nothing you can do. You must just conform to what God has done. Amen. Amen. You see now within that three and a half years what is happening the tribulation as well is there during the tribulation first seal I read here's what I want you to notice a little thing I dropped in here during the tribulation after the bride being called up and A church goes through tribulation. The 140,000 140 144,000 144,000 is called by the two witness of revelation chapter 11. Now look, they'll prophesy 1,23 score days cloth insect cloth. The sixth seal is the tribulation period. In that three and a half years, Israel get to know Messiah. The bride is there in the wedding supper. The church that disbelieve the word of God is going through. Amen. Amen. That what is happening. But I want to tell you this. Brother Brennham said, "I preached like Paul." When I preach like Paul, the message of the first church age will be like the message of the last. When the message of the last church come to an end, the bride is complete. And brother Brenam says, "The seventh seal who brought him down and at the end of the church age They are going up in the sky. No matter what is happening, we are no long in the loudian church. We are in the brightness. Now you start to think as a son and a daughter. We have passed the church. We are in the bright gate. That means time is no more at any time take place. When it takes place all what Putin and Iran what what they think about should be done. You know why some of the things are not because you are stealing. You have so much power to hold the intelligence of Russia and America. You can't do anything while you are still here. Look how poor you are. You don't have money. You don't have you don't have a job. You have nothing. But you have power. Stop all those. You are still here. Nothing will not happen. That means I'm saying we don't have to worry. They can talk and do whatever. God forbid the day we live. Amen. Amen. That lamp will show the world not what you think I position the people through the tribulation three and a half years. People will be tormented. The Bible says they will even while the stone from the mountain will fall upon them and the death will say the sixth seal. The sixth seal is the tribulation period. Amen. That's what takes place. Amen. Amen. Now the good part says the price has gone. Amen. Amen. There's no living creature. Nothing there to say it. It's just now God is dealing with the church. We God is dealing now. God is not dealing. Yes. God is not dealing with the church no more. It's been gone. He's dealing with Israel. This is the other side. This is when Israel received the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelation. Amen. Amen. Abraham says God is dealing with Israel as a nation is dealing with Gentiles as individuals. That is why when you come to a decision, you do it individually because it's between you and God. Amen. Amen. But with Israel, it's a collective. It's a nation of God. You are a bride of God. You are judges. Brother Brenham says, "When a preacher is behind the he judgment." But the children of God judge from the pullpit. You cannot be judged in the white throne church because you create everything. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. To show that you will be eternally in the new city, you must be in the rapture. Amen. Amen. You must be in the thousand years. You must be a judge in the word of God. Then you will be. Amen. Amen. Three and a half years is time. Thousand years is time. Western judgment. And make time. New Jerusalem is eternal. [Applause] So we'll go time after time. And what I like about God, he's doing this for us. Amen. Don't even try harder. No, God has done a comp brother and sisters. What is due to you? What is due to you? The conditions can come. They will never stop the plan of God. God is doing something deliberately. The war between Iran and Isra just a wake up call is just telling you that anytime from now after anything can happen. Amen. Amen. Russia is sustaining there. He won't hit you, but let the bride leave. I hit you and tear you down. Why? The mercy of God is gone. [Music] Amen. Amen. When the mercy of God is gone, the cleing of teeth is something that you cannot wish someone to do. But it's not us. It's God himself doing it because Paul the other say if it was possible. I wish this message that I preach I can preach it to my home state so that they can believe and understand who God is. But it's not in my will. I can't do nothing is the will of God. It is our wish as well to preach to the people that they can believe that is not within our right to make God himself. Let me tell you one thing. The stand, the stand you took, the stand you took according to Revelation chapter 12 is the stand that sustain you today. Amen. Amen. Those that believe the word of God, they shall believe the word of God. And God knew he put you the last age so that rapture. He could have put you during the time of Noah. He could have put you during the time of Daniel. But he decided to put you at the right time according to the plan of God. plant you just unfold you and here you are this morning. You can just sing as a mine eyes have seen the glory coming forth that that's all you can say merciful God brotherham says line between us and the unbeliever but the grace Amen. Brothers and sisters, there are more people that are intelligent than you are, but they don't see what you see. They don't understand what you understand. But you can't even write your name. You were never in the classroom. But God brought that wisdom, eternal wisdom. It's not about what a man think. What a man think limited think. Go and call all the professors. Let them sit here. I will preach here and they will go home and never come back. This was never made for them. was made for you. Wisdom, you don't have a right to boost of what you think you have. Amen. Amen. The missiles in Iran in their intelligency is now ashes. The buildings in Tel Aiv, the wisdom of a man come to an end. God is taking us somewhere. Anytime we go. Amen. I love to listen to Trump. He love the Bible. He quote the scripture and he know something's about to happen. That's why he came for president again so that he can do what he do and he realized that is God using him and that is true. [Applause] Amen. Amen. I come in the name of peace. He kills you in the name of peace. Amen. Amen. And no one can challenge it. When Ukraine Ukraine go to America, they were shaking. When France go to America, they were shaking. When UK meet, Canada, they are shaking because you can't deny America super power. Amen. Amen. They can deal with you very hard. is the lamb. You see now this Bible says the truth. When you read the Bible, reading the book of Revelation chapter 13, you read and pass. But a child of God will want to know what is this lamb and that lamb is America. Now we read about the prince of Mishak and Dub. You just read and pass. But a child of God will tell you is Russia. Amen. Amen. Now the attention is between America and Russia. Israel is in the middle. Donald Trump says if you touch Israel touch me then Russia says if you touch Iran touch me that's what is happening and what goes next goes to the third world war Russia will say China are you joining or not will say I come India will say I come India, North Korea will say then America will say UK, France, France, Iraq, Iraq and then South Africa are you still neutral going for a war because our country sometimes you don't know whether he's going forward South Africa has got about more than 60 million people but I was reading the troops in South Africa. South Africa is the land of peace. We don't have soldiers there below 20,000,000 to fight with. Do you understand? Amen. So my my grandfather fought in the World War II Europe but they were conned that they should support World War II happened getting other country and they started to fight. Now the third world war the war of Armageddon is to wipe off everything. America will never raise the flag. Will never raise the flag. China will never reach the flag. The whole world will be wiped out. Amen. Amen. Amen. Countdown. Countdown spoken word. And now the door is just about to close. at the last countdown. And the church is fixing to take its orbit above all tribulation, all everything. and saw its way to the heavens of heaven carrying the church to the bosom of God. [Music] Amen. Amen. Brother was saying the loudia at that time was about to close. But this morning I said to you the laation churches is closed. Amen. Amen. He came down to pick us up to the wedding s when the world be coming coming to an end. We will be up there looking at it. The missiles going all over. America throwing missile, Russia throwing missile, China throwing missile. You know it will be chaos. The very same weapon that they made ended up killing them. brothers and sisters and Putin knows about it. Know about it. Donald Trump knows about they know the the the weapon they have. They call it mass destruction. If they destruct the mass who will be left behind is the end of human race. We will be going from glory to glory. Taking all those steps from eternal and looking at the world when it passes into ashes. Brothers and sisters, what I'm saying this morning is a truth and it's what is happening.

Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly father, thou creator of all heavens, the earth and beneath. Father, this afternoon we have he had your word. As we are approaching this baptismal service, Father, you gave us the word. Your children are here. They've come from all walks of the world. Father, we have heard your word as your bride. Father, you spoke to us in a very special way. It was as it was in those days when Peter stood when he was telling them that the same Jesus that they've crucified God have make him Lord and Christ. And the Bible says they were pricked in their hearts. They said what shall we do? He said to them repent each and every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins. Father, we are here with the souls through the word that you spoke. They've repented, Lord. They're coming to get a new heart, a new conscience, Lord, yourself, Lord, to come into their hearts, Father. Father, this baptismal is not just washing of the body, but is to get a clean conscious your mind. Lord, one day you spoke and you said, "Let the mind that was in Christ to be in us, Father." So today they're here, Lord, to identify themselves with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. They here Lord to bury the old man and receive a new man. Father, we are here because of their predestination. By your forn knowledge, you chose them, Lord, and wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life. They've heard you, Lord, calling their names. They're here, Lord, to be baptized. And we are here, Lord, telling Satan that he does not have part because, Lord, you died for them. This is a sign that we died with you, Lord. We buried with you and we rose again. And Lord, we believe that as they are going to be baptized, Lord, it's a symbol of burial that they have been buried, Lord, with you and they are rising with you, Lord. And you'll come inside them and lead them and guide them, Lord. As we are standing here, we are eyewitnesses, Lord, of these things that you are doing in this last days. Lord, calling your children to be baptized, Lord, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of their sins, in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] We read Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom he hath crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,"repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Amen. Uh my brother just a song as they are going into the water. God bless you. [Music] [Music] [Music] Come [Music] Oh, [Music] Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] any love. They want us. [Music] There is peace and resting. [Music] They brought us [Music] high.
