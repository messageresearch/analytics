beginning the seventh Church the engine of the seventh Church okay okay I I want to live there for a while [Music] then you will see because if you you go down the scripture he comes to Heavenly verse 20. he says now the address was made by the beginning of creations that means he spoke from the original how many minutes yes that's why now when you're ready he says I stand at the door he died has assistant we help them everywhere yeah they just start assisting people yeah I don't know as an individual then he says indeed then I will come to him we will look at that because [Music] as it

ministers under you you didn't even matter tell us and then I accepted I said the pastor here wants me to lay hands on him now after that he came after some three four days to me and said first time
