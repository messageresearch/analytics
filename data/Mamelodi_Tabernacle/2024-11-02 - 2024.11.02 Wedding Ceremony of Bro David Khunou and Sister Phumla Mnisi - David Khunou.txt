with my brother and as you are here also to celebrate [Music] in the message we want to follow what our Prophet our Prophet when situation like this happens didn't just [Music] offici we follow te when he come to this situation we also try to do what but I'm going to read the scripture but I'm going to United I'm going to read The Book of Proverbs Chapter 19 Verse 14 verse 14 Proverbs Chapter 19 ver14 house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the Lord let us close our eyes as we pray our heavenly father standing I here with my brother yes in front of this company we are coming to thee approaching this holy ceremony we are besing thee humbly to come and be with us as we run this ceremony help us Lord because we don't have anything to do we don't have power the power is from you we are asking all this in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we may take our seats as as I've said I'm not going to be too long I'm going to T to but the Bible where I have read he said house and riches are the inheritance of the fathers in other words father can give you a house it is what he [Music] can and he can he can give you riches [Music] but they she must be from the he must be a gift from the Lord God is still giving people wives just from just like in the beginning it was not a ad's Choice it was God's choice is God who put Adam to a deep sleep and from he took a he produced the wife from ad not but God himself he said the man shall leave his parents and cling to his wife it was God Abraham knew this thing you knew that a wife must come from God when he wanted the wife for his son he had to choose from his household The Trusted [Music] Serv not any other seven but the trusted one because this issue it is the issue of God it's not man's issue he said I must choose the trusted and he made that seven to say he said even though I'm s you but the angel of God is the one will take direct will lead you you are not going to walk alone there because this issue is the issue of God it's not me to see but it's God who must choose that's why the Bible here says you can give your children whatever you want to give them but a Prudent Wife must be a gift from God Amen read Proverbs 18:22 18:22 who so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the Lord it's not easy to find a woman to find you must be [Music] given is it not it is not from you you cannot say i' I've managed to choose the right [Music] woman but it must be from God brother Bram says the best thing God can give to a man besid salvation is a good woman in other way a woman it must be from God you must get him from God even if the prophet says the choice is yours man has the right to choose a woman has the right to accept they got the right to say no or yes but it must be from God Amen you must get hair from God not from a magistrate not from your parents but from god a woman is just part of a man and when a man takes to himself a wife if she is correctly a God given wife are you together with it must be God not parents not friend if if she is correctly his wife a wife she will be just to him as part of him if you are given her by God because from the beginning Eve was part of Adam God gives you a wife he will give you part of you she will never give you another man's P she will give you he will give you your part because he knows which part is am amen are you together with us it must be god-given she says notice now the woman got her place she is a jewel he he said that Solomon said that a man that is found a wife has found a good thing he said a good woman is a jewel in his crown that is an honor but an unrighteous one is water in his blood is the one who you are you were given by your parent is one who you have chosen yourself is one who you is chosen by your friend it will be it will be water blood but the one who is given to you by God it will be a crown read for me my brother there Proverbs chapter 12 let's read from verse one verse one who so loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth reprove is brutish one the one who loves instruction love knowledge because they say when you approach marriage you must have been adved but if you have refused those adves you have refused the knowledge it depends where did you get [Music] ADV because you can't get advices from everybody you have got a parent is your pastor before you approach this this big thing you must V from your parent get advice then you will take a good direction but if you just go through your friends if you use your eyes sometimes your eyes will be used by a sep just like people in no their eyes were used by because what the serpent has used what found through the is UN raous woman your marriage Will Never Last it didn't last there and it never last here because it it started in a wrong fooding verse two verse two a good man obtaineth favor of the Lord but a man of wicked devices will he condemn if a sister found this type of a man in trouble her marriage will be held here on Earth verse three three a man shall not be established by wickedness but the road of the righteous shall not be moved we cannot call you Rous if the rightous one is not in you and if the Rous one is in you the sep will never get chance but if the rious one is not in you then the serpent will always take verse four verse four a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rotness in his bones m [Music] you are studying here now you are studing begin when you are studying here is nice not but everything which God starts Satan will never just leave them like that will try to test them he's going to test you sister to see if whether you are a virtuous woman you will be the one Solomon is talking about will you you will be a crown to your husband but Satan is going to test you but you will manage to pass through if the righteous one is in you if you know who you are if you know where you come from if you know who your father is but if you don't know that if you don't know that then Satan is going to win this battle Solomon says Solomon said out of 1,000 people out of 1,000 men we have got only one who is a man out of 999 they are not men that is what Solomon but he says out of thousand there is no woman this is what Solomon says the prophet says you sister you can be a crown to your husband you can be jewel to your husband if you wish that is what the prophet is saying he says you can be he says notice that that is how it is but you see woman you are a jewel if you want to be a Jew but the desire has to be by you amen amen you can be a Jew you can be water in your husband's blood it depends I'm not talking to these ones only even those are married you are what you are in your family because of your choice your situation in your family is because of your [Applause] choiceful amen a virous woman build his house foolish woman destroys in the family we have got an order let me just finish this one when you got direct Revelation from God that is your wife and the same thing that the rest of your life in other words if you have found a direct revelation that this one is mine is the one you're going to marry because you find a direct Revelation it was revealed to Adam who this one is no one told him he just said this is the bone of my the Flesh of My Flesh it was revealed to him that is what the prophet is telling me here when you got a direct Revelation from God that is your wife and the same thing that is your the rest of your life but what man joins together anybody can put apart but what God joins together no man better try to do that whoever God joined together he said let no man put a no what not some half drunken magistrate is master or something else put together or some backen picture with a bunch of gats in a book that would let them do anything in the world the word of God laying right there living the word of God I'm talking about what God joined together if you have receive a direct Revelation this is my wife nothing will separate because that is the best thing God can give to a man beside salvation it's not our Wis we can talk too much we have got 10 laws of good marriage people have placed them in the in the sleeping room by they divorce we have got marriage counselors we have got marriage officers we have got social workers they are all devor because it needs God the best thing God can give is a good woman you find a woman from God not from anybody else not Professor not not somebody do a specialized in marriage it doesn't need specializ [Applause] the family order is got man wife children that is the family order man wife children amen is a protector man should be a
