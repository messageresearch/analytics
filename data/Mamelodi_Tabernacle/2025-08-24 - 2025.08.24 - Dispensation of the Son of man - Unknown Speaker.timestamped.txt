[1:15:04] uh the book of
[1:15:08] um we start by Luke 17 verse 26-3
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; verse 26-30
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; verse 26-30
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; then we're going to read the book of
[1:15:25] John chap 1
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; verse 1-2 and verse 14 verse 1 to 3 and
[1:15:34] verse 14
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; verse one
[1:15:36] verse 14.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Let's start with Luke 17:26
[1:15:46] and Luke chapter 17 26.
[1:15:52] And as it was in the days of Noah, so
[1:15:55] shall it be also in the days of the Son
[1:15:57] of Man. They did eat, they drank, they
[1:16:02] married wives, they were given in
[1:16:04] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:16:07] into the ark, and the flood came and
[1:16:10] destroyed them all.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Likewise also, as it was in the days of
[1:16:15] Lord, they did eat, they drank, they
[1:16:19] bought, they sold, they planted, they
[1:16:22] builded. But the same day that Lord went
[1:16:25] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[1:16:28] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:16:31] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[1:16:35] when the son of man is revealed.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Let's read John
[1:16:46] 1 verse one to three and verse 14. 1 2 3
[1:16:52] and 14.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the
[1:16:59] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:17:03] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:17:06] All things were made by him and without
[1:17:09] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 14.
[1:17:15] And the word was made flesh and dwell
[1:17:18] among us. And we beheld his glory, the
[1:17:22] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:17:25] father, full of grace and truth.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes as we pray.
[1:17:33] Dear heavenly father,
[1:17:37] standing in front of your children
[1:17:41] in your place
[1:17:44] humbly
[1:17:46] coming into you
[1:17:48] into thy presence
[1:17:51] with my brother here.
[1:17:55] We are asking
[1:17:57] that you use our voice.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] to convey your message to your children.
[1:18:04] We are asking this
[1:18:06] in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:18:09] Christ. Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[1:18:18] I said going to have this topic.
[1:18:25] You know it. You are used to it.
[1:18:30] is the revelation of the son of man.
[1:18:37] Um that is a topic we are going to share
[1:18:40] with you
[1:18:44] but I would like the them to flash my
[1:18:48] sketch on the
[1:18:50] screen there.
[1:18:55] Looking at the sketch there.
[1:19:00] As the Bible has said,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; in the beginning was the word
[1:19:08] and the word was with God
[1:19:12] and the word was God.
[1:19:17] If you are reading the scripture,
[1:19:20] it seems as if it is the word am God.
[1:19:28] Because they say it was the word
[1:19:32] and the word was with God
[1:19:37] and then they said the word was God.
[1:19:43] Then
[1:19:45] when we are looking there,
[1:19:49] the prophet says
[1:19:51] and
[1:19:55] we can read it like this.
[1:19:58] He said you can say in the beginning was
[1:20:00] the logos
[1:20:04] because the word
[1:20:06] is the logos
[1:20:10] and the logos
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; is the theophony theophony.
[1:20:14] Then we can say in the beginning was
[1:20:16] theophony.
[1:20:20] Then if we want to know what is that
[1:20:23] theophony
[1:20:26] that theophony
[1:20:28] is formed,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; it is not formed out of
[1:20:38] but it is formed by
[1:20:43] Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; the seven colors.
[1:20:50] of a fountain
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; We don't say it is formed out.
[1:21:03] If you can say it is formed out
[1:21:06] mean as if it has come out.
[1:21:11] The whole all all those seven colors
[1:21:17] it it it came together
[1:21:21] when they came together
[1:21:23] they formed that locos
[1:21:28] that word
[1:21:30] that
[1:21:32] are you together with me
[1:21:34] in the beginning when we read Genesis
[1:21:39] they Hey, let's read my brother. Genesis
[1:21:41] chapter one.
[1:21:53] Genesis chapter 1
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; verse 1 to 2 only.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Verse one to two.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the heaven
[1:22:02] and the earth. And the earth was without
[1:22:05] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[1:22:08] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[1:22:11] moved upon the face of the waters.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; that spirit which was hoovering
[1:22:21] above the waters,
[1:22:24] it was the spirit of seven colors.
[1:22:29] That's why they call it a fountain.
[1:22:33] of of God
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; When you talk about the fountain,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; it's just like when you say you are
[1:22:46] going to the fountain of water
[1:22:50] is where the water is coming out of a
[1:22:52] rock of somewhere.
[1:22:56] You don't know where does that water
[1:22:58] come from.
[1:23:00] they just come.
[1:23:02] That's why we say it's a fountain
[1:23:05] because it doesn't have a beginning and
[1:23:07] ending.
[1:23:10] He's a fountain of God.
[1:23:12] It's a fountain of spirit.
[1:23:15] That's why the Bible says God is seven
[1:23:17] spirit.
[1:23:21] It doesn't mean that God has seven
[1:23:23] spirit.
[1:23:26] It means when God is using his spirit,
[1:23:31] he's used his spirit seven times.
[1:23:36] He's his spirit here
[1:23:40] and here and here until it seven
[1:23:44] then we say is seven spirit
[1:23:48] but it's one spirit.
[1:23:50] when it is used seven times
[1:23:54] that's why you call it the fountain of
[1:23:55] seven
[1:24:00] when they came together
[1:24:02] when those seven colors came together
[1:24:06] and they formed what we call the word
[1:24:11] which is a theophony
[1:24:14] which is the body
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:24:18] wanted to come to a place where he can
[1:24:21] be seen.
[1:24:26] Somewhere where we can have an idea,
[1:24:32] where we can have an idea
[1:24:35] who what God is.
[1:24:39] Let me just read something here.
[1:24:43] He says here,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; it was the the god that went out.
[1:24:51] Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; The the human form
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; that that didn't have eyes like you see
[1:25:04] a better eye.
[1:25:09] But that all this rainbow
[1:25:13] condescended into a theophony.
[1:25:20] Moses saw it when it passed through the
[1:25:23] rock.
[1:25:27] He saw the back part. He saw the back
[1:25:30] part.
[1:25:32] It looked like a man.
[1:25:35] Abraham saw him
[1:25:38] when he stepped down into flesh.
[1:25:43] But before Abraham saw him, when he
[1:25:45] stepped down into flesh, Abraham
[1:25:49] he met him
[1:25:52] and he was calling himself
[1:25:59] has no father and mothered
[1:26:02] has no beginning and ending.
[1:26:05] It was that
[1:26:08] it was that form of God.
[1:26:11] It was God.
[1:26:14] That is what Abraham meant.
[1:26:17] He met God.
[1:26:19] Then one day when he was there at at
[1:26:23] this place
[1:26:26] he saw three men coming.
[1:26:28] He first of all he saw three balls of
[1:26:31] fire came down.
[1:26:35] Out of that
[1:26:37] came three men out.
[1:26:39] That is God. God just made just took
[1:26:43] dust there
[1:26:45] and make a booty. And he said, "Gabriel,
[1:26:49] get inside."
[1:26:51] They said, "Mega, get inside that one."
[1:26:53] And he get into another one.
[1:26:55] It was God himself in flesh.
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:01] Abraham Abraham met God
[1:27:04] in flesh. If men were passing there,
[1:27:09] they would say, "We have seen Abraham
[1:27:11] there with another man talking not
[1:27:16] knowing that they have seen God there.
[1:27:20] It was God
[1:27:22] in flesh.
[1:27:25] When Abraham
[1:27:27] as mec
[1:27:29] was God in a
[1:27:32] but when God was there in the house of
[1:27:36] Abraham
[1:27:38] he was God in flesh
[1:27:41] after he after after after he had
[1:27:44] finished his talking with Abraham
[1:27:47] then he finished he went back to the
[1:27:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says here
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; in the days when the son of man will be
[1:28:03] revealed,
[1:28:05] it will be like in the days of Sodom.
[1:28:10] In other words, it will be the same.
[1:28:14] But let let me go on back to what I'm
[1:28:17] saying there.
[1:28:20] Let let's flesh our
[1:28:26] when we read John
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; it says that weight
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; which is the theophony
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; which is the logos
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; which is Christ
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; which is the angel of the covenant
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; because in Malachia
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; chapter 3 chapter three
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; it says the Lord you are looking for
[1:28:48] will suddenly come to his temple.
[1:28:52] He says that Lord is the angel of the
[1:28:54] covenant.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; That is that theophony.
[1:29:01] Then when he come the Bible says here
[1:29:06] that word that theophony
[1:29:10] that logos
[1:29:12] became flesh.
[1:29:16] Amen. In other words, it it came into a
[1:29:20] flesh.
[1:29:24] It was the fulfillment of Malachi
[1:29:26] chapter 3.
[1:29:29] That's your funny that that that the
[1:29:32] Lord they were looking for
[1:29:35] will soon come to his temple.
[1:29:38] The Lord they were looking for
[1:29:41] came into his temple
[1:29:44] and he was called Jesus.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; It was God in flesh.
[1:29:52] Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; That's why people didn't understand him.
[1:29:58] He said if you don't believe that I am
[1:30:01] him then you die in your sins.
[1:30:06] It was God
[1:30:08] in flesh.
[1:30:12] He said lady your many sins are
[1:30:14] forgiven.
[1:30:16] The Pharisees said
[1:30:22] he can forgive sins being a man. He say
[1:30:29] they don't understand. Even some of your
[1:30:31] disciples
[1:30:33] they didn't understand him. He say show
[1:30:35] us your father.
[1:30:39] He said Phillip if you know me you know
[1:30:42] my father.
[1:30:44] If you have seen me, you've seen my
[1:30:46] father. That's why people when he says
[1:30:52] when you come to you cannot come to my
[1:30:54] father
[1:30:56] except by me.
[1:30:59] They think he is here.
[1:31:02] The father is there and the son is here.
[1:31:06] Then when you come to the father, you
[1:31:09] must go to the son and the son must take
[1:31:12] you and to the father.
[1:31:16] But he said the lord you are looking for
[1:31:19] is in me.
[1:31:23] In other words because the god is in
[1:31:25] him.
[1:31:28] You cannot go to god beside going to
[1:31:31] him.
[1:31:33] When you go to God, you go to him.
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:38] That's why they didn't believe that.
[1:31:42] They couldn't comprehend it.
[1:31:45] But we know this man is the son of Mary
[1:31:49] and Jesus.
[1:31:51] We know how he was born.
[1:31:53] Why he's God man?
[1:32:02] the the the thing that that that I don't
[1:32:04] like about this man,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; he says he's God
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; when he's a man.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; They said
[1:32:21] what is this? What should they do?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work.
[1:32:30] Okay, it's
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; all right.
[1:32:36] When when we look here,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; he said he was the son of man.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; The weight in flesh
[1:32:48] is the son of man.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Did you believe that?
[1:32:57] He said, "In the beginning was the word.
[1:33:01] The word was with God
[1:33:04] and the word of the word was God."
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; I want you to believe. I I want you,
[1:33:15] you believers.
[1:33:17] But if you will just not look to me,
[1:33:22] but believe
[1:33:24] I believe that what the man said
[1:33:28] is the scripture.
[1:33:30] I don't know as we are as far as far up
[1:33:35] in the time
[1:33:38] he says we are
[1:33:41] but if it is then
[1:33:45] is got to happen.
[1:33:48] If his way are God's way
[1:33:53] then his ways will not fail.
[1:33:58] But God is God's word.
[1:34:04] Because he is the word.
[1:34:07] He says here, I believe that
[1:34:11] a man said in this scripture,
[1:34:15] if it is then
[1:34:18] if his ways are God's ways,
[1:34:22] they will never fail.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:34:29] God is the word.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; When we say he is the son of man,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; the son of man here,
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; it was the word made flesh
[1:34:47] because he said, "Who do people say I,
[1:34:51] the son of man, am?
[1:34:55] Peter said, "Thou art Christ, the son of
[1:34:59] the living God."
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Peter
[1:35:04] was given another eye
[1:35:08] which which could look beyond the flesh
[1:35:14] because the word was in flesh.
[1:35:18] Then Peter could see inside the flesh
[1:35:22] that there is God there.
[1:35:25] Then he said that thou art Christ.
[1:35:29] He said Peter it's not because of your
[1:35:32] eyes.
[1:35:34] It is another eye
[1:35:36] and this is not yours.
[1:35:38] You were given that one
[1:35:41] to see. Who am I? Is not your eyes. Your
[1:35:46] eyes cannot see that.
[1:35:50] It is another eye which we call the
[1:35:54] revelation
[1:35:57] could see through the flesh.
[1:36:00] See inside there. But this is not only a
[1:36:05] man but is the word made flesh.
[1:36:15] In other words,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; all those
[1:36:19] all those seven spirits,
[1:36:25] all those seven colors
[1:36:28] have come together
[1:36:31] and formed
[1:36:33] that theophony.
[1:36:37] Then it was God in flesh.
[1:36:42] Let me see if I can see something here
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; in this book Hebrews. Let me read
[1:36:48] something here.
[1:36:50] I read in the middle there.
[1:36:54] When I read it above there, he says he
[1:36:56] become from spirit.
[1:36:59] He became from spirit
[1:37:02] the great fountain of rainbow
[1:37:08] who had no beginning or no end.
[1:37:12] Then when I read down there the next he
[1:37:15] said next
[1:37:18] followed after that was another color
[1:37:23] to the seven perfect colors
[1:37:27] which is the seven spirits of God
[1:37:32] that went from that great fountain,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; that great diamond
[1:37:42] At the end there
[1:37:44] in that paragraph he says that whole big
[1:37:48] rainbow
[1:37:51] had become in a theophony
[1:37:57] and made in the image of man.
[1:38:02] That is what he's saying here. But let
[1:38:05] me read another one here.
[1:38:11] He says here
[1:38:14] it is the same type of a body
[1:38:18] that we receive when we die here.
[1:38:22] If this tabernacle be dissolved,
[1:38:25] we have one already waiting.
[1:38:30] That was it.
[1:38:32] That was the theophony
[1:38:35] which was the son of God.
[1:38:38] That son, that logos became flesh
[1:38:45] because we were put in flesh
[1:38:50] and theophony
[1:38:52] the logos became flesh here among us. It
[1:38:57] was it was nothing else
[1:39:02] but the dwelling place
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; for the entire fountain. Amen.
[1:39:09] Dwelt in him
[1:39:13] where in a man called Jesus.
[1:39:18] In that man dwell the whole fountain
[1:39:24] of seven colors dwell in that man. He
[1:39:28] was the son of man.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] When you see that it was the full
[1:39:36] fountain coming together
[1:39:41] and they were in that man
[1:39:44] called the son of man.
[1:39:48] The prophet says it was the full seat.
[1:39:54] Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; He said it was in the morning here.
[1:40:03] There it was in the afternoon.
[1:40:09] He says when those seven colors
[1:40:13] unfolded themselves,
[1:40:16] they formed seven church ages.
[1:40:23] Because here
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; at Pentecost,
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; the prophet says it was that same pillar
[1:40:31] of fire
[1:40:34] which divided itself
[1:40:38] into all those people who were there.
[1:40:42] If one of them receive part of it,
[1:40:47] when they are together, they form that
[1:40:50] great pillar of fire.
[1:40:54] But when here during seven church ages
[1:40:57] when it comes in the gentile times
[1:41:01] that seven that great that great body
[1:41:07] that which was formed by those seven
[1:41:09] colors
[1:41:11] those seven colors unfolded themselves
[1:41:15] don't forget they came together
[1:41:18] when they came together they formed that
[1:41:21] Theophony.
[1:41:23] But when they unfolded themselves
[1:41:26] again now, they formed seven church
[1:41:29] ages.
[1:41:32] Each church ages was parting
[1:41:37] up.
[1:41:39] Amen. And during that time,
[1:41:43] it was when he was building his own
[1:41:46] church.
[1:41:49] He said, "I will build my church.
[1:41:53] No one will build it for me."
[1:41:55] He used seven spirits
[1:41:58] in seven men
[1:42:01] in in seven men.
[1:42:04] We are called seven messengers.
[1:42:07] That's why the prophet says they were
[1:42:09] making God known
[1:42:12] to people
[1:42:14] each age. If you want to know God, you
[1:42:19] must see him.
[1:42:21] You must be introduced to him
[1:42:24] by those seven messengers.
[1:42:27] Without those seven messengers, there is
[1:42:30] no knowledge of God
[1:42:34] because they were the ones who were
[1:42:36] introducing God.
[1:42:38] They were the ones who were made making
[1:42:40] God known.
[1:42:43] They were little lights.
[1:42:47] In that age,
[1:42:50] your message
[1:42:52] was the full Holy Spirit.
[1:42:56] If you have received the message,
[1:42:58] you had the Holy Spirit.
[1:43:01] You were you were complete.
[1:43:04] Amen. You lack nothing.
[1:43:08] If you have received the message of the
[1:43:09] messenger
[1:43:13] particular age you were complete
[1:43:23] because when that's why now we living in
[1:43:26] another dispensation
[1:43:29] each dispensation
[1:43:32] God has loaded a weight
[1:43:36] for that particular dispensation
[1:43:39] because there are predestinated people
[1:43:43] who those words are loed to
[1:43:48] when that word come they receive it
[1:43:52] because it is loaded to them.
[1:43:55] It is sent to them and they will never
[1:43:58] miss it.
[1:44:01] is impossible
[1:44:03] to for them to miss it because it is for
[1:44:06] them.
[1:44:09] When God was wrote in these seven
[1:44:11] churches
[1:44:13] when God was each age has got a
[1:44:15] messenger
[1:44:18] and under that messenger there were
[1:44:21] shepherds there under those shepherds
[1:44:24] there were congregations there.
[1:44:27] They were already loed there.
[1:44:31] Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe if you are a pastor
[1:44:34] from God you wereed when the when
[1:44:38] brotherham was slaughtered
[1:44:42] you you are also there.
[1:44:45] Amen to come under that message
[1:44:49] and if you believe the message from your
[1:44:51] pastor
[1:44:53] it means you areed under that pastor.
[1:44:58] [Applause]
[1:45:00] Amen.
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; There is no sheep
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; without the shepherd.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; A sheep without a shepherd is a lost
[1:45:11] sheep.
[1:45:15] Living the Lord
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:19] is a goat with a sheep skin.
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:28] God has predestinated these things.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Is each age
[1:45:39] until you get to Martin Luther
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; because during that age that seat died
[1:45:46] there
[1:45:49] and he started to rise
[1:45:51] in the fourth church age.
[1:45:54] And in the in in the fifth church
[1:45:58] is added to germinate.
[1:46:02] Then we say
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; that message there.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; It was the the just
[1:46:10] live by faith.
[1:46:13] It was a complete mess for that age.
[1:46:18] But God was building his church.
[1:46:23] But for that age it was a complete
[1:46:26] message. Those who those who lived by
[1:46:29] faith
[1:46:31] they were complete.
[1:46:34] They will be they will together with us
[1:46:37] when we are raptured.
[1:46:40] They will be part of the rapture also.
[1:46:44] That's why they waiting for us.
[1:46:47] That is we are living in the fullness of
[1:46:49] time.
[1:46:52] We are living people in the olden days
[1:46:56] wished to live in this age.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they saw them coming.
[1:47:08] They saw these things coming
[1:47:11] and they long.
[1:47:17] But you are living in this age.
[1:47:20] and you play with this message.
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; All right, let's just go. They go on.
[1:47:30] Each age
[1:47:33] has got that particular
[1:47:36] weight
[1:47:38] for that age.
[1:47:42] But during that seven church age,
[1:47:47] the prophet says it was a dispensation
[1:47:51] of the son of God.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Because here
[1:47:56] it was a dispensation
[1:47:59] of the son of man.
[1:48:02] Amen. Then during the seven church age,
[1:48:06] it was a dispens of the son of God.
[1:48:11] It is where Zachariah says
[1:48:15] there will come a day where it will
[1:48:17] never be night or a day.
[1:48:21] It was during seven church ages.
[1:48:26] It was the Holy Ghost
[1:48:29] building his church.
[1:48:33] The Holy Ghost here. It was like a rain
[1:48:38] because there were there were seeds here
[1:48:41] which needs rain.
[1:48:44] They so that they can grow
[1:48:47] to maturity.
[1:48:51] But at the end there
[1:48:54] at the end there
[1:48:57] we we go back to a seat again.
[1:49:03] When when we have arrived
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; to the seat again,
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; we no more need the rain.
[1:49:14] Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's another dispensation
[1:49:18] because what we were looking for,
[1:49:21] we have arrived.
[1:49:24] The s
[1:49:27] has arrived to what he sowed.
[1:49:31] The seed he has sown, it has it has come
[1:49:35] back again.
[1:49:37] If it is a seed again,
[1:49:40] it means it is the son of man again.
[1:49:45] Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Because here he was a complete seed.
[1:49:52] We were all in him.
[1:49:56] All the ages were in him.
[1:50:01] All the messengers were in him.
[1:50:04] You were in him.
[1:50:07] He wanted to manifest you.
[1:50:11] Beautiful. Amen.
[1:50:13] Love it.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says he became
[1:50:16] flesh.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Because we were flesh.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; We bypassed our theophanes
[1:50:25] because of sin. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; We came to be flesh.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted to take us back
[1:50:35] to our theophies again,
[1:50:38] he must be in flesh so that he can come
[1:50:41] to us to lift us.
[1:50:45] Amen.
[1:50:48] To go back to where we were,
[1:50:53] you were there in the beginning. That's
[1:50:56] why the prophet says if you are not
[1:50:58] there, you will never be there.
[1:51:03] Amen. You will be there if you were
[1:51:06] there.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:15] Then in the evening time,
[1:51:18] let me say this,
[1:51:22] he was the Holy Spirit
[1:51:25] during seven church age
[1:51:28] at the end of the seven church age.
[1:51:35] Bible says, the prophet says the
[1:51:39] messenger
[1:51:41] of each age
[1:51:43] comes at the end of the age
[1:51:48] to call people
[1:51:50] out of this age.
[1:51:52] Amen.
[1:51:54] Amen.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; And the seventh angel messenger
[1:51:58] came at the end.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Then that's why the Bible says now
[1:52:06] he came
[1:52:08] when he came
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; to Abraham
[1:52:12] He came in a form of
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; of men
[1:52:18] being a man eating
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; with them man.
[1:52:25] And he said at the end
[1:52:28] when the son of man is revealed it will
[1:52:33] be like that.
[1:52:35] In other words,
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; it will be a man
[1:52:39] in flesh
[1:52:41] eating.
[1:52:43] Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; But there must be Abraham
[1:52:47] and Sarah
[1:52:50] because this message
[1:52:52] of this man Elohim
[1:52:57] was meant to go to Sarah.
[1:53:02] It must do something.
[1:53:06] in
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; when
[1:53:12] when it comes to there.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:53:17] in the evening time
[1:53:20] there shall be light. The prophet says,
[1:53:24] "When those at the end there, those
[1:53:27] seven colors
[1:53:30] will come together again."
[1:53:34] And when they come together again, they
[1:53:36] will form what
[1:53:38] that again.
[1:53:44] When these seven colors come together
[1:53:46] again, they form that theophony
[1:53:50] and we call it the headstone
[1:53:55] because it is formed
[1:53:59] is Christ again.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; The head stone.
[1:54:08] The prophet says, "I am not the son of
[1:54:11] man.
[1:54:14] I am a son of man.
[1:54:21] The son of man revealed himself
[1:54:26] through a man.
[1:54:28] That's why the Bible says just like in
[1:54:31] Abra no Abraham's days
[1:54:38] a man came there
[1:54:41] it
[1:54:43] amen.
[1:54:45] A man must come
[1:54:48] in this dispensation
[1:54:51] and eat.
[1:54:53] But if it's a man eating, it must be God
[1:54:57] in that man.
[1:54:59] The Bible says so.
[1:55:01] It will be like that
[1:55:04] when the son of man is revealed again.
[1:55:07] We must look for a man.
[1:55:11] But it must be God.
[1:55:15] Amen.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Well, if we don't see that,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; he says here in this book, the seed of
[1:55:24] discrepancy,
[1:55:26] let me read page 92.
[1:55:30] Now, tonight,
[1:55:32] but let me before I read this one, but
[1:55:35] let me read this one before I read this
[1:55:37] one. Because when those seven colors
[1:55:40] come together,
[1:55:42] they form that theophony. Again,
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; are you together with me?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; It says here,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; in the beginning,
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; this is CO 339.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; We'll go back to our Hebrew teaching
[1:55:57] just a a few men
[1:56:00] was this great big fountain of seven
[1:56:02] colors.
[1:56:04] How many knows that?
[1:56:06] And how many knows that God has seven
[1:56:09] spirits?
[1:56:12] Absolutely.
[1:56:13] seven spirits
[1:56:15] and there were seven eyes in the lamb
[1:56:20] and so forth
[1:56:22] all that coming together now.
[1:56:29] Amen. All those seven colors
[1:56:33] are coming together now.
[1:56:41] Now tonight in the days when we got this
[1:56:44] great discrepancy
[1:56:47] of discrepancy
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ promise in Luke
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; in the book of the trumpets.
[1:56:56] He says h Jesus was reading the same
[1:57:00] scripture
[1:57:02] Genesis chapter 18
[1:57:05] when he says when the son of man is
[1:57:07] revealed
[1:57:09] it like in the days of Sodom
[1:57:12] he was reading the same scripture
[1:57:17] he was saying it there will come a man
[1:57:22] but being God in flesh
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:27] Now tonight in the days when we got this
[1:57:30] great discrepancy,
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:35] Jesus Christ promised in Luke
[1:57:38] that in the days in the days before the
[1:57:41] coming of the Lord be like it was in the
[1:57:44] days of Saul.
[1:57:47] When the son of man would reveal himself
[1:57:51] like the son of man
[1:57:54] revealed himself to Abraham
[1:57:57] down there
[1:58:00] Elohim Elohim
[1:58:02] he will reveal himself again
[1:58:06] as in the evening time like like there
[1:58:11] Elohim
[1:58:13] that is what the prophecy
[1:58:15] God made flesh among people
[1:58:20] embedded there
[1:58:22] with Abraham and showed him and told him
[1:58:27] what Sarah was thinking
[1:58:31] in the tent.
[1:58:33] And he had never seen
[1:58:37] and called her name Sarah,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; not Sarai. Sarai.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:46] Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; In in in this here more
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; what is that thing
[1:58:58] here?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; We see the same thing.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; God
[1:59:04] coming together.
[1:59:07] That's why we say
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; here
[1:59:12] down there God revealed himself
[1:59:17] in man.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; There
[1:59:25] the word came flesh.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; But it's not the flesh like this one
[1:59:31] here.
[1:59:34] This one was born of man and woman.
[1:59:40] But God, it it pleased God
[1:59:46] to choose this man,
[1:59:49] the son of Ella and Richard Brenham.
[1:59:56] pleased God
[1:59:58] to choose this man that he is going to
[2:00:02] dwell in him.
[2:00:05] The full path, the full the fullness of
[2:00:07] God
[2:00:09] dwell in him because God himself
[2:00:13] revealed himself.
[2:00:16] All right. Amen.
[2:00:19] The prophet says, "What pl what blinded
[2:00:23] Israel back then?
[2:00:27] It was amen.
[2:00:29] Amen. And what is blending gentiles here
[2:00:34] is amen. Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; The same thing blended Israel there. The
[2:00:41] same thing is blended the Gentiles.
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:50] That's why after seven church
[2:00:55] we say no more rain
[2:00:59] is another dispensation
[2:01:03] when people say
[2:01:05] you'll forget you'll forgive me
[2:01:08] when they say come and receive the Holy
[2:01:10] Spirit
[2:01:13] we want to know what do they mean
[2:01:17] when they say come and receive the Holy
[2:01:18] Spirit
[2:01:20] Because the prophecies
[2:01:22] this time here there is is is another
[2:01:26] time the anointing there is the pillar
[2:01:30] of.
[2:01:32] Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; We are not receiving gifts.
[2:01:37] We are receiving the the giver of the
[2:01:40] gifts.
[2:01:41] [Applause]
[2:01:45] What is happening here is not happen
[2:01:49] here.
[2:01:51] Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Because here they were receiving gifts
[2:01:56] but we are not receiving gifts.
[2:01:59] We are receiving the gift
[2:02:02] of the gifts. The prophet says the
[2:02:05] anointing there
[2:02:08] is the anointing of the pillar of fire.
[2:02:12] Amen.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; That is what is happening.
[2:02:19] That's why he says when he took the
[2:02:22] book,
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; he left his editorial seat.
[2:02:30] He is no more a mediator.
[2:02:33] If you believe he has taken the book,
[2:02:37] then you believe that is nor.
[2:02:40] If you you you don't believe that
[2:02:44] he still your mediator
[2:02:50] because if if he stood up there,
[2:02:53] he took the book and we believe that he
[2:02:56] has taken the book and he opened the
[2:02:59] seats and he has given them to the seven
[2:03:02] angel messenger to reveal them and he
[2:03:06] has revealed them to us
[2:03:08] and he said this is the secret
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; just like Elohim
[2:03:17] Abraham
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; I'm coming
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; have a son
[2:03:25] this one says
[2:03:28] this is the secret the weight is in the
[2:03:32] bread
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; is a secret
[2:03:38] the living
[2:03:42] That's why when we are here we are
[2:03:46] eating.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet says.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; What what do we eating? We are feeding
[2:03:52] on the ba body weight
[2:03:56] of the son of man.
[2:03:59] He is the hidden man.
[2:04:02] He is the carcass
[2:04:05] that the eagles are feeding on.
[2:04:09] Only the eagles
[2:04:12] but not crawls and vultures.
[2:04:16] But only the eagles
[2:04:18] are feeding.
[2:04:20] Why are they feeding here? They are
[2:04:22] feeding here because they are about to
[2:04:24] fly
[2:04:26] because this cacas will give them power
[2:04:30] to fly.
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:34] [Applause]
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] May you together with me
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; when we here
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; when he sinned
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; in in the garden of
[2:04:56] he was driven out
[2:05:01] through the eastern gate.
[2:05:04] They put cherabs
[2:05:07] to guard the way the tree of life.
[2:05:12] Cherabs were there with a sword.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; 1963 1963 the prophet
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; received a sword
[2:05:23] in his hand when it is revealed to him.
[2:05:28] They say it is the way
[2:05:31] in your hand.
[2:05:33] In the place
[2:05:36] of the cherubims, there was a man there.
[2:05:41] It will never be any other man
[2:05:46] beside the son of man.
[2:05:51] Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Who must get into that gap?
[2:05:58] to close that gap
[2:06:01] because it was the place of man.
[2:06:06] It is taken by the cherubim
[2:06:10] waiting for man
[2:06:12] to come back
[2:06:14] to take his position.
[2:06:16] That's why now we are marching
[2:06:20] towards the tree of life.
[2:06:23] Amen.
[2:06:25] Because now the sword is leading us
[2:06:31] not back
[2:06:33] through.
[2:06:35] If you come here and you miss
[2:06:39] you go back
[2:06:41] then you'll wonder
[2:06:44] what happened in history.
[2:06:47] What's happening?
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You mean there is no more mediator?
[2:06:53] I know
[2:06:55] the power of God,
[2:06:59] the Holy Spirit moving
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; because
[2:07:05] you have fallen back.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Now your eyes
[2:07:13] are blinded.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; You can no more see.
[2:07:18] Even if they can preach
[2:07:21] and prove by spoken word,
[2:07:24] you will never see
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; when when they arrived here.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; We have now we have arrived at the gate,
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; the eastern gate.
[2:07:45] That's why
[2:07:47] we shall come back
[2:07:50] and talk about what is happening in
[2:07:52] Israel there
[2:07:56] because after Elohim
[2:07:59] has spoken to Abraham and Sarah.
[2:08:04] He vanished.
[2:08:06] That is what happened to us.
[2:08:09] And what is happening after that? What
[2:08:12] happened?
[2:08:14] their bodies
[2:08:16] changed.
[2:08:19] Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; But what changed their bodies?
[2:08:23] It was the word which was spoken
[2:08:27] and received.
[2:08:29] Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And when God speaks the word, if it is
[2:08:33] the purpose of God,
[2:08:36] nothing will stop it.
[2:08:38] If God says this is the cigarette, the
[2:08:42] word is in the bread. Nothing will stop
[2:08:44] that. The word is in the bread. If it is
[2:08:48] not in you, it means you are not part of
[2:08:51] it.
[2:08:57] And that weight that's why we fit
[2:09:00] we feed on the body weight.
[2:09:05] He said they said store the food.
[2:09:08] This is the commission to the prophet
[2:09:11] and he told that
[2:09:13] man will rise
[2:09:16] all these spoken words
[2:09:19] man will rise pick up the nugget
[2:09:24] out of those spoken words to feed
[2:09:28] because out of the spoken way there are
[2:09:31] hidden mana there you must pick them up
[2:09:35] and feed
[2:09:38] God bless you.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:54] [Music]
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Brother, will you stand up and
[2:10:00] pray
[2:10:03] and thank this message?
[2:10:10] and lose this service.
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Bless you.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads?
[2:10:35] and open up our hearts
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; after with great word
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; that came from eternity
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; the spoken word
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; which is the original seed Lord
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; once again
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; we have reached the capstone
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; we have reached
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; that white stone
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; the ministry of the son of man
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; when God said let us make man in our own
[2:11:04] image.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Man lost his godship
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; and cherabins were put there with a
[2:11:14] flaming sword.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; The seventh man
[2:11:19] in this last days
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; on Sabino Canyon.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; It was the footprints
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; on the sense of time.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; God once again
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; heaven and earth have come together.
[2:11:34] Father, we are so glad to be so
[2:11:37] privileged.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; To have this honor.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; That all the great men wanted to see
[2:11:43] these things.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; And to hear what we are hearing.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. to see the manifestation
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; to see the expression Lord
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; the vindication

[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; through pastor
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Makua
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; under this great ministry
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; of giving us the rapturing faith
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; of the changing of our bodies
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; as it was with the prophet Lord
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; he said it's later than we think
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; exactly Thank you, Jesus.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Because this is the time, Lord.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; We've been rounding the circles of
[2:12:23] eternity,
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; hitting the spot.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Bless our pastor.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Bless all the children, Lord.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Your children that you chose
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; and you wrote their names in the lamb's
[2:12:34] book of life
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; And today, Lord, you are demonstrating
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; this great showdown.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. that the bride has
[2:12:46] make her ready.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; The bride has make herself ready
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; because of the word of the Eliza Eliza
[2:12:54] of our day.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; And yes, I've came. Father, we thank you
[2:12:59] to be the God of Abraham,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; to see the manifestations.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You said in your word that all
[2:13:13] nature was groaning

[2:30:25] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:30:27] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
