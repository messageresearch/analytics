[Music] Uh good morning uh family uh and friends. Fore on behalf of the family um we would like to thank Thank you for taking uh the time uh to be with us today as we celebrate uh the life of Elas Moro Mul. Um it occurs to me as I'm standing here now that a couple of months ago or six to be precise uh was the last time I stood in front of family and friends to speak. Uh it was a sunny spring day and uh the occasion was quite joyous. I stand here before you today on a cold winter day and uh the occasion is not so joyous. Such is life I guess. [Music] Um we are overwhelmed and uh extremely grateful for the outpouring love and support uh that you have shown over the years and uh you continue uh to do uh up to up to this day. Uh the deceased was my father uh but was to his peers uh boy. Uh that nickname uh in those days carried with it another nickname uh which is Biza. He was boy to his peers. He was malume boy to some of you and he was also braza uh to most of you. He was one of six siblings. Uh fifth born uh one of two sons uh the rest uh uh being ladies, women. [Music] I would like to share with you. I know my some of our speakers will will come and speak at length about the attributes of of the men. Uh on my part I would like to share uh first I think a formative lesson that I learned from the men. Uh I think secondly will be an accomplishment that I thought we shared together. Uh thirdly uh is a regret that I have uh and there's a lighter part uh as as the fourth part um as a lesson uh that was metered out to me in my formative years. Um time came when like most of us I had to go fend for myself and and work after uh acquitting myself uh with school. Um at the time I was I was cashless. I needed funds for Galia, suits, ties, and all. Of course, money for transport. And I knew I had a dad. And I walked up to him and I said, "Uh, can you help him out? Can you help me out, Dad?" He said, "Of course I will." Uh, the money was provided, but he made it very clear that that money was repayable, so it was a loan. And I thought what kind of a father is this? I mean, you know, I thought he would be supportive throughout. I started work um in a few months as we had foreseen. Um it became apparent that I would have to acquire a vehicle which I needed as a tool of training to be able to progress with my uh my profession. Uh I thought I had repaid uh the first lumpsum you let me go and ask again hopefully this time I'll get away with it. So I approach him again. I say I need help. I don't have a great record. Can you help source funding for me and we'll see how it goes. He said no no banks. I will give it to you. But once more it is repayable. And so the money was advanced and I worked and I paid it back. On the third occasion when I thought I had arrived, I needed more space. I had to move away from home. I approached him again. On this occasion, I was not asking for money. He was just giving notice that I was about to take exams. traveling from Joker to David took a lot of my time. I wanted to move closer to work which was in Park Town then. So I needed a small space somewhere and he said you've got my blessings you can go and I said thank you and he said you forgot something. I said what? He said you need money again. I said no not this time I I'm okay. and and the next day he handed me a cash and he said this time it is a gift. &gt;&gt; And the lesson learned there I guess was to teach me to respect the value of money because I would have worked for it so that if I have it as a gift I treat it as well as the one that I would have earned. Um that was the lesson. Uh I see viewers laughing there. He owes me that one. Um the second uh that being the lesson, the second is an accomplishment that I thought we shared uh equally together. Uh there came a time in my life when I became curious about who my ancestors were. asked a lot of questions and he indicated that my whilst I knew where my grandfather lay uh the search was for the great grandfather and anything higher if we could find. Um he recalled taking a trip to Guazulunatal where uh they buried the our my greatgrandfather his grandfather and he expressed a longstanding wish uh to visit that place at the same time that I was curious. um together with family at some point we organized a road trip during vacations. But what we included in there was a stop uh at the place where we sought to track and trace the burial place of uh my great uh grandfather. Um, and we succeeded uh because we took a trip to a small town called Thornville uh between Peter Marisburg and Richmond uh Escortism Kizer where we found the remains of my greatgrandfather uh intact. In case you're wondering how he ended there, um he was from here but uh after the uh departure of um her first wife, he remarried uh uh uh lady from uh Escort Kis and and lived there for the rest of his life. Um that was an accomplishment that I thought we shared. uh uh together uh during that holiday. He he spoke about it a couple of times uh expressing satisfaction about the discovery. A regret that I have um is that well one step back. So my maternal grandmother and my paternal grandmother are both scoras. [Music] I have had occasions where I was invited by Kosanas which I would have thought were the one part and didn't expect the other part yet the other part turned up and it occurred to me as I became wiser that these families are are related but what I asked questions about and have not been able to establish is to trace back the common ancestor further back and I imagine my father could not provide the answers. We spoke about it a couple of times. He was keen. He meant to make arrangements with those who could know but we never managed to to resolve that uh query in my head. So a challenge to the scorers in the house. I need to know how is it that both my grandmothers are scorers. We will take this out. We'll take this offline. Lastly, as I said on the lighter side, um uh I I acquired my love for jazz uh because he was a big jazz fan. Uh the music would bellow in the house. uh on weekends and at the time I used to think uh this was madness. Little did I realize that he would leave uh with me a legacy that I have recourse to um when I need to relax and I thank him for that. [Music] Uh in conclusion, um I would like to [Music] express uh sincere gratitude to all of those who uh were supportive uh particularly after uh we lost our mother. Um [Music] I intend to single out the few people and in so doing please I do not exclude um those of you who who who were supportive and I think firstly uh I must thank my wife uh he he was very appreciative of your support. He uh Baba expressed his gratitude to me for the support that Ti gave her throughout the years. Of course, he gave her a nickname and he apparently used to call her Sui because she was nagging her with care and attention etc. But he expressly acknowledged uh in the last couple of months when I was driving home with him uh the support that you have provided. Uh Sara uh thank you very much. Baba spent the last 3 years or so of his life with Sara who who was taking care of him and he seemed uh at peace in in Sah's presence. Thank you very much. Lastly, I don't know if he's here. They call him Gadza in the neighborhood. He's the neighborhood doctor. His name is Masasi Gatani. Uh I would like to express uh my sincere thanks and gratitude uh for the endless house calls that he rendered the urgent scripts that could ask uh at all times. Uh he was responsive um and we thank him very much. Uh and yes all of you thank you once more for all the support that you gave him. Thank you. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Receive [Music] [Laughter] how when I [Music] [Music] Hurry. [Music] Are you allowing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] How to holy is holy. [Music] abusive.

Frank [Music] for [Music] God. Oh my god. [Music] [Music] [Music] Holy jealous. [Music] [Music] Holy God. Holy God. Holy God. Holy God. [Music] Baroto is Unfortunately, Fore speechech. foreign. [Music] Let's follow [Music] Enough. [Music] [Music] And I think for me has never been the same. He has never been the same. You for the rest of your life. [Music] tochech. [Music] Morocco Morocates. foreign. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so many years. But I always counted on and the entire family for for support. foreign. [Music] [Music] [Music] I do my [Music] adjust. I do [Music] 1 Corinthians 13:13. And now these three remain. Faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. And I have experienced so much love this entire week. I'm eternally grateful. It was overwhelming. It was outpouring love everywhere. I feel like reg even though papa has left but I feel there was so much love around me around the family and me. So in the week [Music] a word came up and this word was foundation and so bonus sisters and I had a lot of. So what I would do and then ready for phone and in doing that um I for whatever reason would run towards [Music] as I know him. I'm going ahead of myself. I'll come back to that story. Let me start with some memories that I remember. So, Baba [Music] very much so. Mama when I was about two I think had to leave nursing school and so papa became the primary parent and he became you know my go-to. Um, so one of my memories are um [Music] cook up. she could cook and I just walk past her because papa was my person and mama would get so hurt and in fact I I I wasn't friends with my mother. I was thinking about this for a very long time because Baba was the foundation. And um one other memory I have is um primary school. So I say this I say I this story is around foundation. So this is these are my formative years where you know I'm shaped where my personality is being molded. Um primary school So papa I'm sure he thought every Sundays we'd go to church at the time I think was in boarding school. And then again, I'd say and he wasn't going to have it. I'm sure now that I'm older, it's because And I was thinking actually I'm not I've never been a girly girl because and I've never really cared about her. But there's a quote about trauma and we talk we talked about trauma in the week that we have from our parents and there's a quote I'd like to to share. Trauma decontextualized in a person looks like personality. Trauma decontextualized in a family looks like family traits. And trauma decontextualized in a people looks like culture. So I look at myself now and I'm like in this week I've been reflecting [Music] They some of them traumatized me. One good because I was never again a girly girl ever. So whether holiday we would have to wake up was always up by so [Music] So that would mean student. So that would mean and that and I feel today I can't sleep past a certain time and because they're not allowed in the kitchen. So it's become a personality but it started off with trauma. So what I'm saying is some trauma will shape us and I think we should look at what our parents tried to do and appreciate you know they were shaping us. Okay. So let's go to the next memory. So this memory I I would hope that fathers um learn from because papa was a he was I would describe him as a silent but very present love. I do not think my father ever told me he loved me, but I completely knew it because he was constantly there. So at this time We are the choir competition and another thing about my father he was practical in the absence of my mama 6 to6u became a deputy parent and I I have a memory of and I And get strict instructions because my father was very practical. I'm the only one and I have tried. I have pleaded and he's not having it. So I I've given up. Okay, I'll be that girl. So and we were just about to leave. I think I'm in maybe [Music] [Music] I have never been with so much pride. Baba had gone and bought me a jersey because I had cried. So I think that to fathers showing up like that for your girls. I remember I was skinny. I was very skinny. But I remember walking out wearing that cardigan and feeling like I own the world with so much confidence because [Music] So that's that's one memory. The last I hope um now I'm going to bring it to my this week. What's happened this week? So in this week now I'm coming back to me running in this week. And as I ran I I don't know how I got drawn to running. And I realized when I was young, okay, I'm going to come back to what said that's another trauma actually. I hate fish. Brown bread. Everything [Music] would not have it. So, so then you'd say I would do that. I'm guilty of that. So, every so often. And then one day during the holidays, no man, this is not lost So I used to go to Los. Now I'm coming back to my memory of running there. I imagine papa was in his maybe mid-4s and so I walk in and I can imagine he was 45. I'm not allowed in there. That was the only time and that became a tradition. So because that's what my friends would say. So that was the only money I could get from my father. And in conclusion, with all of these, you know, these characters that were built um through him being really my primary care, my primary caregiver or primary parent for the formative years. Um um and I would walk. So it was I think it was 3 days that I did this. I would walk and kind of pay respect to these memories of me growing up and then I run back home these past 3 days. And then it occurred to me I have not walked to here since I was that child, that kid, that little girl. And it it made me feel so good. And then what happened in the week also is that on two occasions primary school friends of mine came and I was so excited to see them and I thought this is actually a gift of you know it took me through memory lane and so now I bring it to the present and the present being I think Since I have a journal entry that um in fact this it starts here a ginal a youth group that I belong to yoker that we've been attending for men since I was about also formative 10 11 12 and we've stayed together since and so um this season I'd say the past two years has been a season of loss for all of We've been singing this song 183 and I would I think for the first time because I heard it over and over again. I started paying attention to these words and I thought hey man I must find this one. I I need to memorize this because it was healing to me. And then I tried, you know, I I got it, you know, the Lord is my shepherd. Psalm 23. I I like I tried and I wanted to memorize it so that I keep saying it. And then in this youth group, one group something clicked. Now this is one of the psalms that you will say at school. You had to memorize. I think and something clicked and then I saw happy. And this is I diorized it in June of course cuz course now I can't find it but I think it was in the 25th of June so that I I knew it and because I had known it before it stuck [Music] and I've been saying it since then and so to my I don't know I think I was so I was so emotional when this youth group came on Wednesday but and Lind was 23 and so I've been preparing since the 25th for this day and I was so emotional if I didn't know God was here. Now I do. And I'm going to invite all of us to recite it with me. I'm going to stop. [Music] [Music] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. A round of applause for my sister. [Applause] So, she's actually taken all the weights. So, well done. You presented me very well. So I'm I'm I'm just going to try to also redeem time because I think a lot has been said. You know, I'll just say something uh also because it so happens that I'm the last one to see him before he departs. Uh it happens that on a Thursday last week Thursday he visited he came to my house uh through the help of my brother who brought him to my house and then he spent the weekend with us. So little did I know that that was the last weekend. Um but one of the things that my father was very smart um he was very observant. Uh he he he you know he could see things into details. H and when he talks it's after you know he has analyzed everything. Um so and I knew that you know through the journey of life um somewhere I had converted you know to other belief you know and um I knew that I cannot preach to him um because of certain reasons. Um but when he visited me what we would do uh during co we spent time together and I we would uh put in because we were not going to out we just put a church service in and look at the monitor h you know someone's being preached and um because he's very observant he was observing and he had comments on the sideline. But the brief of it is that one of the days he said to me, "When I depart, I want these people that you worship with to be the ones that bury me." Now not in a bad way but I don't know for what reasons but I think there are certain things that he saw in the last moments and he said this is how I would want to depart. We from we are Anglican as a family where I grew up. But his words to me was that when I depart I want you to arrange for me with the people that you worship with. So on that that is why we didn't you know go to Anglican. It was just in honor of his wishes that he he wanted. Then um to repeat, I'm going to um put it this way. He was okay from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. That's when he started to um show some signs of you know instability and he started by throwing out first and then I think he did twice thrice then after that I mixed a concussion that we call moto you know to try and replenish the fluids lost and then he drank half a cup and he felt a little bit better Now uh with my son we said no you are tired let's take you to rest he answered asked he said I'm resting where I am actually he said I'm already resting at that point I didn't it didn't register you know but because he was weak we decided to take his bed and put it where were sitting so that we could observe him. And that night I decided to sleep on a couch next to him so that if he needs to go out to the toilet or something, I'm close by, you know. And um little did I know that after that that was his last time uh to sleep. So in the morning when I woke up, he was no more. But I could tell that he departed in a peaceful way and to keep it. So on a Monday morning because I realized in the morning when my son was going to his work, he also realized that uh something is not right here. So when he was driving, he called me on his way. He said, "Dad, did you check his pulse?" I said to him, "Yes, he's no." So, there was a colleague that they travel together to work. Two two of them actually. So, one of the colleagues um lift club said to my son, "Let me put it this way." My son dropped them off. He went to his work and then later one of the people text my son to say, "Um, I heard you talking about someone who is now late. Is this man that you're talking about? Short hair, short gray hair, skinny, and his beard are like those of a goat." You know, goats have Then then the the the description was so precise that my son wondered because this person didn't know my father but he describes him exactly the way he looks. So he said I couldn't sleep from 12:00 at night. There were this man was in my dream until about 4:00 and he was always staring at me and that actually was a confirmation to me that it means my father passed on around 4:00 a.m. in the morning because he said the dream left me 4:00 a.m. but I struggled with the dream throughout the night. So that gave me comfort that uh you know he departed in a peaceful way. On that note, I'm going to ask just to redeem time erh the next speakers, not the the speakers actually the next item which is going to be the reading of rats so that they can come to the form h and then after that it will be the reading of the obituary and then I will leave the sermon for past uh so that um we can be able to go out having listened to um having listened to uh the word of God. So let me do this. Sorry before I rush to that. We've got grandchildren first. Yeah. And they can come to the And then after them h is going to be grandchildren. After the grandchildren is going to be the rhythm of life. Good morning. your potato and your friends. We're pretty much last born 1175 Dong Street. Growing up, my siblings and I were incredibly lucky. We had the rare and beautiful blessing of being raised by all four of our grandparents. And you know, each of them played a very specific powerful role in shaping who we are today. On our maternal side, there's Gabby who taught us all about style, but more importantly anchored us in spirituality and religion. And then there's our grandfather beam. He's the most calm and the most loving man you'll ever meet. He never forgets to remind us how beautiful we are. And then on the paternal side, we had the late Noisa. She was strict and fierce and she was independent. She taught us to be liberal and rethinking. And then there was Dr. Mo, the man we're here to honor today. He was the embodiment of discipline, routine, and what we call today selfcare. He taught us how to show love in our own way. And what did that look like? Okay, so one of my biggest pet peeves in life is people who don't respect time. Being on time is not a courtesy to me. It's one of my strongest traits and a strong value I live by. It's a value I learned from Dolo. For Dooo, being late was never an option. In fact, being on time is not good enough. Holo would take us to school. All you hear, hey little, whether at some point we had to take him to the appointment. Hey mining, the roads are packed. You don't know what's going on outside. That was his thing. And on the selfare element, I think alluded to this earlier. And these are the traits that we carry as adults today. And then of course as mentioned um he was a man of routine and discipline. So part of his routine was his he'd always used the same way whether [Music] it was always the same way. So much so when was still around we'd always be like he always takes the same way you know. So we used to tease that it was boring going with him because unlike Dudu, he never took detours. If he was fetching you, you knew that you're going straight home. Duaka after school and then you'd go on errands on errands on errands. It would eat into homework time. But with you knew he's going to fetch you, you're going home. So when it was exam time, you definitely wanted Damo to fetch you because there was no time to waste. Looking back now, it was just part of his steady, predictable way. The kind of consistency you could count on. For him, his love was structure, routine, and showing up consistently. That was his way of caring for us. And I can say I don't think I ever heard that say, "I love you." But like Nikki said, you would see it. uh when I was living with them in grade 8 and nine, my dad would send me an allowance and my grandparents would keep my card and I what my grandmother was doing I think she wanted me to be cognizant of how I spend money. So if I needed anything I would have to say and then she would write down all my costs. At the end of the month she'll take me to Absa so I can withdraw and pay her back what she gave me. And then I realized Hollywood would never ask me to pay him back as papa. So that's when I learned that's the guy when a sparkling water when chocolate when a magazine he bought it all for me and that is how he showed me love. You know when it was tense after we had had a fight, my grandfa my grandmother would say, "And yes, we will cry. We miss them. And yes, we always will. But we also smile because the love, the lessons, and the memories that Molo left behind, they'll stay with us forever. Dr. Molo, thank you so much for showing us discipline, pride, and routine. Thank you for loving us in your own strong, steady way. We'll carry your legacy early bathed and prioritizing routine just as you would have wanted. &gt;&gt; Rest well now. &gt;&gt; We love you. [Applause] Zoeto mat. Okay. All right. Yes. [Music] [Music] [Music] As soon as we all stand for me to [Music] get up and twer. [Music] [Music] High. [Music] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm about to start the reading of the obituary. It reads as follows. We gather today to honor and celebrate the life of Moro, affectionately known as Braziliza Elas Mulot, who passed away peacefully on the 4th of August 2025 at the age of 84. Born on the 8th of November in 1940 in Chanty Town Apex to the late Machaya Multo and Latias Kosan Moro Gaspent's elderly childhood in Chanty Town before his family was relocated to Davidton in 1950 during the forced removals of apartate. [Music] A bright and dedicated student, Morag began his schooling at St. Andrew's Missionary School. He then proceeded to study at JC Mahungala Secondary School. He received a bizarre in 1957 to study at Kilan High School where he metriculated in 1959. After metriculating, despite his desire to further his studies, he was compelled to work back his bursery by assuming employment with the town council, managing liquor outlets in Davidton with discipline and responsibility. He later served as a finance administrator at the men's host until his retirement after which he ran a school transport business with pride and dedication. &gt;&gt; Morning everyone. Um, once again, thank you for being here. Um, about my grandfather, he was a man of discipline, punctuality, and strong values. But even with those strong values, some of you are blessed to know that he couldn't resist stealing a spoon of sugar from the cupboard. However, he can rest easy now, knowing none of us will catch him. Earlier, I mentioned punctuality. Yo, papa was serious about that. He would let nothing stop him. Once he was at my house and it was the morning he was due to go back home. His transport soon arrived, but at that time I was in the shower and like I said, nothing would stop him. So soaking wet in a towel, he made sure I opened the gate for him just so he could maintain his punctuality. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye, but if it meant us having a conversation in my shower once again, I'd gladly take it. Mo was a man of discipline, punctuality, and strong values, which he instilled in this family. In 1967, he married the late Napoa, and they raised three children together. Moroka IAS Modo will be remembered for his quiet for his quiet strength, deep commitment and unwavering principles. He has survived by his sister Dia, his children, Muetsi and Naniki and his grandchildren Landumo Mli Vway and way. A mal [Music] The word of the Okay. Peter so [Music] no my simple Oh, single to [Music] my God. Oh my god. [Music] [Music] I would like to greet you all in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; My name is Peter Scosana. I was requested by our brother Lord just to come and deliver some few words of comfort to the family. Uh we fellowship together with our brother Met. So I just will bring some few words. I I always have a problem when we are in a funeral, more especially expressing ourself in English because our tradition is that now we are blacks we have to use our language but uh for the sake of time said no we can go on but if there's somebody that is not comfortable We have an interpreter who could come over and interpret. You just speak to Mete or whoever it is who's not comfortable who cannot hear English. So mine is to bring now the words of comfort of which uh it's a difficult thing to do because there's nobody that can comfort uh somebody that has lost his loved one. The only way of comforting that person is to bring that person back of which I can't resurrect him. So maybe we'll just bow our heads before we read the word. Mighty God, eternal father, creator of all things, thou who was, who is, and who will live eternally. &gt;&gt; Amen. You so loved us, Father, that you shed your blood at Mount Calvary so that we could be safe and you even gave us your word to bring the knowledge and understanding of everything that you are doing. Thank you father now that we are gathered here as I've uttered some few words that nobody can bring any comfort to anybody. You are the only one Lord. So we pray gracious heavenly father that the words that we're going to read here may they find place in our hearts and be a comfort father. Thank you father for we pray calling upon the name of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. I will read from the book of Psalms uh Psalms 27. I will read just two verses. Psalms 27 [Music] verse three says, "Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident." Verse four, one thing that I desired of the Lord, that that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. You may be seated. God bless you. Yeah. What I want to share with you here is that now David here saw he said one thing that he desired of the Lord and he seek that says now one thing that I desire and and what I seek after is that I may dwell in the house of the Lord. Let me just maybe say that will be my title. dwelling in the house of the Lord. And then he says here that uh while he dwelling in the house of the Lord not temporarily says now all the days of his life. Now how can you dwell in the house of the Lord? So all the days of your life because he's speaking about beholding the beauty of the Lord and to inquire. So now when when uh somebody has departed, there is that uh gloomy feeling uh of which you you can't control it. It just comes automatically. Though we know all of us that we have to depart but there are some things that we hear. Some says when somebody has departed has gone to heaven. Some says has gone to hell. Some says no. You just become a wind. And some says, "No, you're going to meet your ancestors. You're going to sit with them and relax there." Now, some knows the truth. Some are very innocent. They don't know the truth. I've I've lost my sister h yesterday. So I was with my niece then they said to me uncle as we are planning they said should we bring the coffin here on Friday I said okay why why so it's two boys I said tell me why do you want to bring your coffee here I don't say don't bring it just want to No. And then he says, "No, uncle, it's our culture. It's our culture." I said, "No, I am." [Music] And then our culture has got no coffee. In our culture, we dig a hole, we slaughter a cow, we cover the body with a with a with a with the skin. So now you're talking about the Okay. They said okay fine uncle should we remove the furniture and take the goles to the rooms and so that when people come they must visit and go into that room. I said, "Where did you get that?" Then they said, "It's our culture, uncle." I said, "Where did you get that culture?" All right. But now I was just teasing them. I know that when I'm saying that some are saying where does this man come from so I was just teasing them now because in life you have to go to a point where you have the knowledge and understanding about your life your life and you have to know have a knowledge and understanding that when somebody's departing Exactly. Without guessing, you should know you know that person when it departs is going to and what what is to depart. That is the separation of the soul and the spirit. Isn't it? We all know that &gt;&gt; the soul separates from the spirit. As you are alive right now, you've got your mind that controls your body. That's not scientific. It's it's just a simple thing. Your body is controlled by your mind. At times it relaxes. You go to sleep. You know that subconscious and conscious they they sort of separate and then they engage again in the morning. You stretch yourself. We are yourself. You continue. So now that's why I say some knows that you know this world is not our own. were just passes by. Uh you could see I'm gayheaded. I was once a young man was once very energetic and running but I could see that the days are numbered. &gt;&gt; So I should not pretend as though I don't see that. So you might say are those the words of comfort? No, those are the words. You know, in the olden days, we used to be afraid of a when the night comes, can't go out. Even if the parent says go and get water, you say baba, and then you've never seen it, but it's there. See, so now when it comes to the departure or the so-called death, people get into that trends. Why do they get into that trends? Because we've got uh different dimensions. Some dimensions are are scientical, some are spiritual. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scientical one, you could understand it with your mind, but the supernatural one, you have to be supernatural to understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to be spiritual to understand it. There's a body that was born by your parents, but there's another body that is not born from your parents. It comes from God. &gt;&gt; It comes into that body. When this body that is born by the parents h it had no life until the nurse spank it and then then life comes into that body and then when the life comes into that body you're saying Right. &gt;&gt; But when the when that child reaches a certain stage, he should be taught. Okay. All the time he will be taught about this kosanas, how we live, all the traditions and everything. But we should understand that now actually there is God who created heaven, who created earth, who created everything. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Right. We should not pretend as though we don't see that we know that there is God and we should know that. Now there's a time where we need to engage ourself with that God. His ways are very difficult compared to the life that we are living here. It's very difficult. But we have to now when now David here speaks about living in the house of the Lord. How can you do that? The only way of doing that is that now you take that life of God, let it be within yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. or you yourself you are you'll be in him because there will be two people sharing the life because when he's speaking about the house of the lord l the lord has when he prepares you when he created you when he formed you he created his house in you when he want to visit you there is a place in your heart where he visits you that That is why he formed a man out of the dust of the earth. That man was not alive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was not alive. He was like a no piece &gt;&gt; until he breatheth the breath of life into that into that man. Then man became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now when man became a living soul having the breath of life from God. So that man had a place when God want to visit that man he will visit him through the place that he himself himself has created in you. God cannot create you for a sweet boar roll. There is a reason why God created you. &gt;&gt; You are not here for fun. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you are here for a reason. He's got a reason with God, with you. And his reason is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Now, if his reason is supernatural, then he must create a box in you so that he must plant that supernatural to you. And that box that he has created in you is your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have a soul. And when God speaks to you, he does not speak to you through your mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No. That is your lecturer that will speak you through your mind at the university. &gt;&gt; But when God visits you, regardless of who you are, he has created a place in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then it comes to your heart and that is supernatural. And the only thing that God needs from us is nothing else but just faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he says you cannot please him without faith. &gt;&gt; And faith is a substance of thing that you cannot see. &gt;&gt; You've never seen God. Not even a single one of us have seen God personally and say that's God. We have that faith that there is God. We've never seen heaven. It's written here that New Jerusalem is shining gold in blah blah blah. We've never seen it, &gt;&gt; but we believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, we compare and contrast. We were born taught in another way and there's word of God that came. Now you have to decide actually are you engaging to this or you throw it away you engage. If you don't engage to this this there's a repercussion. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So now there is a word of God. Of course it's written here. It's a Bible. It's a paperwork. The words that are written here. Some says no. this thing comes through white people. We've got our own tradition as black people. Fine. There's no problem. But now me as a devel uh our tradition is that now we've got our ancestors. &gt;&gt; We got our ancestors. One day my uncle took me to uh ina I was sick. Then this man saw his bones and look at them said to my you see that one there is is skew which means this boy is going to suffer the rest of his life. So I was sitting there right within me I said this guy is telling lies I've got hands going to work and then he said baba baba this child of yours is denying what I'm saying I could hear my uncle chased me away and said go out you are tempering in a field that is not yours. So I I had to believe but I always wanted to challenge him and then I was not given a chance to challenge him because he will tell you it's our tradition. I said, "No, Baba, where does this tradition comes?" She said, "No, it's were born and born. We were born with that thing." Fine, but why don't we? I said, "No, now you're telling me about my great grandfather, right? Who couldn't help me with the school fees? I suffered with school fees and that was my grandfather. If you don't do that, your grandfather will squeeze your neck. So, so it's things like that and then comes the Bible now. The Bible now where does this thing come from and then our fathers will tell you know this thing is for the white ours is this way. But I said dad why is ours you know it is very cruel. You don't have to wear shoes. You don't wear this. Okay let me leave that. I'm here to tell you about how to live in the house of the Lord. To live in the house of the Lord. You you you know if if you say let us exchange life, let me be you so that you could be me. &gt;&gt; How would we do that? You know, uh Jonathan and David, they once did that. Jonathan wanted to be David. David wanted to be Jonathan. Actually, what they did, they exchanged thoughts only. But there was a time this man Abraham met God. When he met God, God gave off himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Which means then Abraham became God and God became Abraham &gt;&gt; and that became one thing. So that's was a person that was created by God in the garden of Eden. God took his life like God is a spirit. God has got no beginning. He's got no end. He's got no mother. He's got no father. He's got no relity. His God is Elohim. But in order that he should be God, he must take a form. &gt;&gt; Then that form is called the world. Still the word is invisible. You cannot see it. Then is a spirit. The spirit is also invisible. You cannot see a spirit. But then when God wants to be seen, he need to create his own body. That is why the scripture says a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. And that virgin, she conceived of God. She conceived the word of God. She does she didn't conceive a seed from a man. No. &gt;&gt; No. She met an angel. The angel said, "No, you will conceive." She said, "Never. Not me. I don't know any man. Then the angel said, "Is there anything hard for God?" Then the the woman said, "Let it be." In other words, now she receive. Let it be according to your word. What she received the seed of the word that she believe. And after she believed and then she conceived. That's why the Bible says uh the seed of God remains in you and the seed of God is the word and when that word comes into you it germinates it forms a supernatural person of which you cannot see that's why Jesus Christ was crucified because the word came into you and then he called it the father. He says, "No, the father is in me." They said, "Show us that father of yours." Said, "No, I've been with you for so long. You don't know me. I am in my father. My father is in me." That's it. Now, he dwelt in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when it dwell in the house of the Lord, it's when the word of God is in you and it germinates and forms the real you. The real Bab is not this this body that is in this what you call box. No, that's not him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I'm standing before you speaking but the real me is not this body. This body is carrying me. &gt;&gt; The real me is the man inside me. &gt;&gt; That's the one. So now all of us should know that these that's why Bible says it's the that's why the Bible says uh this body is going to deteriorate right when it deteriorate the more you receive the weight the more this one gets older and older and deteriorate. We are talking here about eternal life, not a temporary life. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right? The word of God when it comes into you, it brings your real body. &gt;&gt; That is the body of the word. That's what you were before you became what you are. &gt;&gt; But that one came in process. In process as the word is preached, you believe it. And when you believe it and then that body starts forming into you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ was crucified he was taken into a tomb and when he resurrected he resurrected with another body. That body could go anywhere. They will hide themselves. He will just go in and say peace be with you. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; With another boy. Now they will talk about him. He will go to them and say, "What are you saying?" &gt;&gt; They said, "Where do you come from?" He's in another body. That's the body that will never die. &gt;&gt; But this one dies. The other one does not. But the one that does not die has got its own dimension and it's got its own direction and got its own things. If one believe the word of God, then the body of God, the part of God, that's why you'll be called the son of God. That is part of him. The word of God is his son. Right? If the word of God is his son and it comes to you and dwells within you, you become the son of God, not this body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. the man of the wind that is in you. So now all of us you need to know actually why are we here in the world, why we are here. We are here just to demonstrate who we are. Right? &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about the new heaven and the new earth. Right? And the Bible speaks about the end of the world, which means the world will end. &gt;&gt; It doesn't speak about the end of the earth. &gt;&gt; It speaks about the end of the world. The system will end. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; So there is life after death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is life after death. The Bible says in the book of Peter, I think first Peter chapter 3 verse 9, it says, uh, after his death, he his spirit went to hell, spirit of Jesus Christ went to hell to preach to those spirits that repented, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then if you read it in Revelation 1:18, he says, "I was dead, but now I am alive." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I've got the keys of death. He's got the keys of death. So the this death has got no power because he took that. You remember he said to Peter, "Peter," and then they gave him the keys of the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then he took the keys of death from the devil. So death is the death has got no power. Now the consolation is that that now there is no power in death. So we don't respect death &gt;&gt; because it does not come from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right? So if the Bible says here Peter I mean uh David speaks about uh living or dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his livelihood. He says, "Now he behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple." I want us to read another scripture just to back this one up. It's it's it's in the book of Psalms chapter 34 verse seven. It says here, "The angel of the Lord encamped round about them that fear him and deliverth them in order to live in the house of the Lord. There should be an angel of the Lord that is encamping around you." &gt;&gt; By that does not mean there's an angel that is always going around you. No, that angel is nothing else. You see, it says now the the the angel of the Lord encamped round about them that fear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and deliver them. Now when you surrender your life to God, then you change your way of living. You take I mean your your your your your your manner of living become somebody else and that somebody else is the owner of the weight because you receive the weight. When you receive the weight, somebody comes within you in your heart and you become a changed person. Your personality and your character changes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Now when your personality and your character changes, it change and becomes what the word is. It becomes exactly you believe the word of God. That is why the Bible says he deliver them. We were born in sins all of us before our mothers delivered us there were two angels flying supernatural we don't see so immediately when we are born one angel came within you that is why you have to one day when you hear the word of god you have to take a decision to Uh-uh. No, I'm no more going that way. I want to leave this body. You see, God does not force anybody. Even in heaven, he never forced the angel of the cherubs. Said the choice is yours. &gt;&gt; It's not an opera size. He's not saying no, you take it or leave it. No, no. Just saying we are free. That's why Lucifer decided, okay, fine. I want to build my own kingdom. So fine. You could build your own kingdom but not here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So they fought. Then there's two kingdoms. This kingdom of the devil, the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So it depends on an individual. &gt;&gt; Fine. It's yours. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But here the the comforting word is to make people understand. The Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17. It says God God he he cannot just say come and worship you without assisting you. Never. It says God will give you a spirit and knowledge of understanding. He will give you &gt;&gt; a spirit of knowledge and understanding. Help you. &gt;&gt; That is why he says I'll give you a comforter. You read it in in the book of John. I'll give you a comforter who will comfort you. Who will direct you? Will direct you. But that is doing it according to the predestination. You know that there are angels when the when when when when God and and and the devil were fighting in heaven, the devil managed to persuade some of the angels, right, to fight. And those angels, the Bible says, they left their &gt;&gt; first estate. &gt;&gt; And because they left their first estate, so they took their own destination. There are those angels that says no, we are not leaving our first estate. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. That is their own predestination. So the choice is with somebody when the soul the spirit and the body separate the the body goes to the grave. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The spirit goes back to God. Not all if it comes through. You know when Jesus Christ was been baptized, heaven opened the spirit came and dwell in him came like a dove until the voice says this is my beloved son in it comes from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if one does not surrender his life, the spirit cannot go to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the soul of the people that depart goes to different direction. It depends you know I understand one somebody was saying he's got two dogs in himself one is black one is white then they ask him actually which one do you like? Says no it depends on the one that you feed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It depends on on what you like. So when you depart, you go to a place where you are working for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As we are here on earth, we're doing we're serving. It depends on who you who are you serving. If you are serving those that have done poetry, you know about that guy who sold his soul to the devil. And then when the time comes now for the devil to come and fetch that soul, then they dramatize it and give you show you an hour before the devil comes with how is the reaction and you can check it with the great people that died. They confess that no all great people some says I was a fool. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I should have taken the other direction because when death comes is where now you it's where now you take a decision and it would be too late. When you see the death comes with now let's go. The other people will never see you. It's a supernatural thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll be crying. You'll be shouting. You'll be doing this. Some will drive will go very peaceful. Some will go. We are not all going to the same direction. The Bible says, you read it the book of Acts chapter 13, I think it's verse 47. And you read it again in the book of Jude. Judas got only one chapter. You read verse six. He says that there are those that are ordained for condemnation. You can preach until you are red and you can preach until you ache. They won't take. They're predain. They are ordained for condemnation. There are those that are ordained for eternal life. Not that God is got upper gate. He says this one is is ordained for that. No, he gives you a free will. A free will. You you take your choice. Now when you depart, you go to a place where you're working for. &gt;&gt; That's that's how it is. Now, David here says, "Mine is to dwell in the house of the Lord." And to dwell in the house of the Lord is to receive the word of God. And to receive the word of God is to engage with him all the days of your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That is why when we believe, we say we are believers, we believe the word of God, we we keep on praying, we keep on reading, we keep on asking questions about this and this and this. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because we want to know exactly this thing is it the truth or not. Now we are living at the last time. The Bible says there are those that will go before there are those that won't go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What those that won't go, they will change their bodies. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God has got life in it. It's a seed. The seed has got what we call the gem of life in it. When you plant a seed, that seed has got the gem of life. It must germinate. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word of God when we say we have received the word of God we mean this the blood I mean the the the the the the cell of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken and the life you know there is life in the blood. Now that life is a spirit. You are a spirit. You read it in Romans chapter 8:E1 16. It says our spirit and his spirit must come to mesh together. So your spirit and the spirit of God must come to a point where they are one thing. And then when there are one thing then you go to John 10 verse35 it will tell you that now when the spirit of God is in you when you receive the word of God that makes you an amateur god that makes you a minor god and then when it makes you a minor god you you become a god but a minor one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when you are a minor god, look, there's nothing that God did without uh Adam knowing. There's nothing that Adam could do without God knowing. They've become one and the same thing. Even when when when when when when Adam when Adam backslided, God knew that he has backslided. He knew that he was backslid. When God is coming, he knew Adam will knew that God is coming. Then that will make you one with your creator. That will make you one with with with with with our lord. &gt;&gt; So the reason now for us whenever one has departed that's why we read a scripture and why do we read a scripture? We read a scripture when it speaks about the angel of the lord that is encumbered. is not talking about the second person. It's talking about you. It's talking about you, your angel. You were an angel before you became you came into this point in heaven. You're an angel. You read it. It says the throne of God is surrounded by angels, by cherabins, by saraphins, by 24 elders. See you are in heaven. The real you is the one that comes from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this body comes from your parents. That's right. &gt;&gt; There is a natural birth and there is a supernatural birth. &gt;&gt; Now, if you are born naturally and refuse the supernatural death, &gt;&gt; then you're taking a wrong direction because you were created by God. This world, this earth, planet and every flowers and every rivers and mountains and everything was created by God. It was not not created by our ancestors, &gt;&gt; created by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for a reason. And he wants you to line up with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he says he's going to arrange a place, he doesn't take any Tom, dick, and hairy. No. &gt;&gt; No. He doesn't that he takes those that surrendered their life unto you. That's why the Bible says he that overcomes. You must tell me when it's time. It's time now. Oh, thanks. [Laughter] Okay, fine. The the ways of comfort are those. You see now my time is fito. When you see them coming, it's like when the devil coming to fetch you, you're going to say it. I don't say they devil. So I'm not saying that song, brother. So no, thank you. Let me read the last scripture then we close. I I want to explain it. It's in the second book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8 verse 7. It says, "But we have this treasure in an earthn vessel. The excellency of the power may be of God." In this earthn vessel, we've got a treasure. Then he goes on and say, "We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. We were perplexed but not in despair. &gt;&gt; Persecuted but not forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always bearing in the b in the body the dying of our Lord Jesus. that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our may the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Okay, MC [Music] words of comfort from Kosana before Mr. Loto h my elder come just to his seal up the words of kapello and then Mr. which I will take it as we'll take uh the announcement for us. &gt;&gt; Let us go ahead and pray.
