[54:47] church in the name of our Lord Jesus
[54:50] Christ knowing Lord

[55:19] us Lord in a special way Lord father
[55:23] thank you in the name of my Lord Jesus
[55:25] Christ we pray
[55:27] amen
[55:28] amen you may be seated God bless
[55:35] [Music]
[55:38] you the title will be even so come Lord
[55:52] Jesus now why we have chosen this
[55:59] title because it has to do with the time
[56:03] that we are living
[56:08] in uh it
[56:11] link family and closely and
[56:19] strongly yeah and with full
[56:23] awareness that we like each and everyone
[56:26] to be
[56:30] aware of what is going
[56:34] on and also be
[56:40] aware of the power that is in
[56:45] him are we
[56:48] together so that that lifs us up from
[56:51] being church goers
[56:57] and then
[56:59] we become
[57:02] the
[57:07] manifestors there are
[57:11] prophecies that has to do with the time
[57:14] that you are living
[57:17] in then we have been
[57:21] chosen as the
[57:24] bride to manifest those
[57:30] there are mysterious
[57:35] things that are revealed to
[57:38] us as the
[57:41] bride so now ours is to manifest those
[57:47] things that's why we are the
[57:50] bride and that is why
[57:53] God decided to reveal the
[57:59] we that's why the prophet
[58:02] say the word is now in
[58:07] the now uh I have read
[58:11] here a
[58:13] scripture Mark
[58:17] 1534
[58:20] 154 when our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:27] uh uh was uh on the cross hanging on the
[58:33] cross let me
[58:35] see let me say when
[58:39] Jesus hanging on the
[58:43] cross Christ was not
[58:47] there because if I say our Lord Jesus
[58:52] Christ I will be saying even Christ was
[58:55] crucified
[58:58] so it was Jesus the
[59:03] body so the Bible says at the nth
[59:09] hour
[59:11] Jesus you see cried with a loud
[59:16] voice
[59:20] saying which is being interpreted my God
[59:24] my God why has Thou forsaken
[59:30] me it means then Christ was no more
[59:36] there if you go to Mark 14 verse 34 my
[59:43] brother and read that for
[59:48] us and said unto them my soul is
[59:51] exceedingly sorrowful unto death Terry
[59:55] ye here
[59:56] and watch you hear what he say he said
[59:59] his soul was exceedingly
[1:00:06] sorrowful that was before he was
[1:00:12] arrested now what what what I want to
[1:00:14] bring
[1:00:17] forth uh is that now the father was
[1:00:21] dwelling in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:27] that very same
[1:00:29] father and then it was uh at the end
[1:00:33] time during that
[1:00:36] time was about to be
[1:00:40] crucified and then when he was about to
[1:00:43] be
[1:00:46] crucified there were birth
[1:00:51] pains he was
[1:00:54] supposed to have
[1:00:58] right amen now the prophet speaks about
[1:01:02] those best
[1:01:05] pains we have read about the birth pains
[1:01:08] when he was about to be
[1:01:15] crucified that there was an
[1:01:18] angel that
[1:01:20] appeared from
[1:01:22] Heaven to strengthen him
[1:01:27] now
[1:01:28] remember the Rapture is about to take
[1:01:33] place when the rapure is about to take
[1:01:37] place there should be bir
[1:01:44] pains see amen because I'll tell you why
[1:01:50] so I just want you to to be aware of the
[1:01:53] title because the text will be the
[1:01:55] translation the
[1:02:03] bride says even so come Lord
[1:02:09] Jesus we want to
[1:02:12] show the the the sorrow that is in the
[1:02:18] world and the threats that are in the
[1:02:23] world and that nobody
[1:02:26] can ever
[1:02:31] ever to save the
[1:02:36] world that is why we have to
[1:02:41] go because the the the level in which
[1:02:45] the world is
[1:02:48] in it seems to be a an improvement and
[1:02:53] it's technology is very high everything
[1:03:02] is but the world is about to
[1:03:07] explode you hear what I'm
[1:03:09] saying I say the world don't say the
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:17] Earth is about to
[1:03:21] explode but then there's a part that was
[1:03:24] sorrowful to Jesus
[1:03:29] that we have read about but when you go
[1:03:32] to Revelation chap 1 verse
[1:03:36] 18 he says I am
[1:03:39] he that
[1:03:42] live right amen and was
[1:03:45] dead and behold I am alive for forever
[1:03:51] more that very same person who was
[1:03:54] saying Aloo
[1:04:00] so he says
[1:04:02] behold I am alive forever
[1:04:08] more and I even have the
[1:04:11] keys of hell and
[1:04:16] death when he was on the
[1:04:20] cross nobody could interpret him
[1:04:25] he was the only
[1:04:27] one that understand what is going
[1:04:31] on even even
[1:04:33] before he told his
[1:04:37] disciples that my heart is so
[1:04:41] sorrowful unto death because
[1:04:45] tonight I had to be
[1:04:47] arrested and then when he was saying
[1:04:50] that the disciples could not interpret
[1:04:53] that
[1:04:57] the only people that can interpret the
[1:04:59] world
[1:05:03] now it's you and
[1:05:08] me because we are chosen we see what is
[1:05:13] going
[1:05:15] on right the mystery of
[1:05:20] God is when men
[1:05:24] combine with God
[1:05:26] amen right amen they linked
[1:05:31] together now linking
[1:05:34] together of the
[1:05:36] bride and the groom brings about the
[1:05:42] Rapture
[1:05:44] because is the word giving birth to the
[1:05:51] word so now that is why I'm saying
[1:05:55] we should be strongly
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] convinced why we are saying even so come
[1:06:05] Lord
[1:06:08] Jesus you know our our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] used to
[1:06:12] say my father dwelt in
[1:06:16] me speaking about the father that dwelt
[1:06:19] in
[1:06:21] him okay Amen Let us then continue
[1:06:28] uh I'm going to read Revelation 3 verse
[1:06:33] 20 remember the title is even so come
[1:06:38] Lord
[1:06:42] Jesus
[1:06:45] right now if if there's an
[1:06:49] overcomer then it should be somebody
[1:06:53] that has fought a battle
[1:06:58] you cannot be
[1:07:00] overcome if you haven't
[1:07:02] fought amen together amen now can you
[1:07:06] read uh that verse my
[1:07:10] brother Revelation chapter 3:
[1:07:13] 20 behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:07:17] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:07:20] door I will come into to him and will s
[1:07:23] with him and he with me
[1:07:26] sub with him and he with
[1:07:30] him now when he says
[1:07:33] sub speaking about
[1:07:37] sa right amen now uh I didn't give the
[1:07:43] the technical team this code but they
[1:07:46] will just follow it I'm sorry about that
[1:07:48] amen there is a code in this
[1:07:51] bookan church h
[1:07:56] that one that hasn't got
[1:07:58] paragraphs now it says
[1:08:02] here now there is a great deal of
[1:08:05] confusion over the this
[1:08:12] verse that behold I stand at the door
[1:08:15] and
[1:08:17] knock and if any man hear my
[1:08:22] voice and open the door I me I will come
[1:08:27] into
[1:08:28] him and St with him now the prophet says
[1:08:32] there is a great deal confusion deal of
[1:08:38] confusion over this
[1:08:40] verse because so many people he says
[1:08:44] workers use it in personal
[1:08:53] evangelism as though Jesus was in their
[1:08:56] hearts door of every sinner
[1:09:06] knocking as though Jesus were at the
[1:09:11] doors of every sinner
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:20] knocking knocking for
[1:09:24] admission it will be then he says it
[1:09:27] will then be said that if the sinner
[1:09:31] open the
[1:09:35] door the Lord will come
[1:09:39] in but he continues but this verse is
[1:09:42] not talking in talking to individual
[1:09:51] Sinners he says this whole message has a
[1:09:57] sumission as as does every message in
[1:09:59] every Church
[1:10:08] age right amen now he said this is the
[1:10:13] condition of the Lan church is as it
[1:10:17] and near
[1:10:27] towards the end of
[1:10:29] it is the condition of
[1:10:32] it it's not a personal
[1:10:36] message to one person it's the spirit
[1:10:40] telling us where Jesus
[1:10:45] is Christ has left the
[1:10:50] church you see amen Christ has left
[1:10:53] thean church
[1:10:58] that truth is that Jesus has been
[1:11:01] steadily pushed
[1:11:07] aside until the last
[1:11:10] age he's pushed outside the
[1:11:16] CH that that's what he
[1:11:19] says but now I want us uh that that is
[1:11:24] the message to the Church of the last
[1:11:29] age they've pushed Jesus
[1:11:33] out that is why is no more in the
[1:11:37] church because the
[1:11:41] Pentecostals uh have refused
[1:11:45] him are we
[1:11:49] together now let's
[1:11:53] continue now uh let's start by uh maybe
[1:12:00] checking what is happening in the
[1:12:05] world and then from there on we'll come
[1:12:09] to ourselves as a
[1:12:12] bride does this book birth
[1:12:16] pains pains let's start from paragraph
[1:12:22] 88 the prophet says here
[1:12:26] well if the world
[1:12:28] has if the world has to give way to the
[1:12:33] B of A New
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:39] World are you
[1:12:41] aware there is a
[1:12:43] birth of the new
[1:12:47] world Amen in other words this
[1:12:51] world it's at the end
[1:12:54] [Applause]
[1:12:56] so that there there's a p
[1:13:00] pain a new world is about
[1:13:05] to and if a new world has to be
[1:13:10] born the prophet
[1:13:13] says you look at the the sequence of the
[1:13:22] pain the sequence of the bad
[1:13:28] pains he says even the
[1:13:31] doctor when the woman is going to give
[1:13:35] birth he he checks the sequence of the
[1:13:44] pain the the painful or the harder is
[1:13:47] the
[1:13:51] pain the near is the best
[1:13:56] now it says
[1:13:58] now the world is about to give
[1:14:02] birth of a new
[1:14:10] world let's just examine some of the bad
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:15] pains we are having on
[1:14:19] Earth then you will
[1:14:22] see about what day and and and and just
[1:14:25] about how far she is along in her
[1:14:34] labor paragraph 89
[1:14:37] says the first the first world
[1:14:43] war show great birth
[1:14:49] pains it shows one of the first that was
[1:14:53] the first one first B PS p Pains of
[1:14:57] going into
[1:15:03] labor because of that time for
[1:15:07] her we had brought forth the
[1:15:12] bombs machine
[1:15:15] guns poison
[1:15:19] gas that was during the first World
[1:15:23] War 194
[1:15:28] 1914 now those were the
[1:15:32] pains during that
[1:15:35] time maybe many of
[1:15:37] you cannot remember you said I was just
[1:15:40] a little boy of about 8 years
[1:15:45] old but I remember them speaking of this
[1:15:48] m
[1:15:58] and then he says how just looks like it
[1:16:01] just get started it's a pain but it's a
[1:16:03] small
[1:16:07] pain it's just a bomb machine guns
[1:16:12] poison
[1:16:13] gas chlorine gasas during that time it
[1:16:18] was a terrible
[1:16:20] thing that was the pains
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:28] paragraph
[1:16:30] 90 and we find out now we've had a
[1:16:33] second world
[1:16:37] war I'm not telling you about
[1:16:40] history compare it with the
[1:16:44] scriptures and then we know that the
[1:16:46] time that we are living
[1:16:49] in it has to do with the third
[1:16:52] pool it has to do with the revelation of
[1:16:55] the seven
[1:16:58] se but is to compare you the
[1:17:04] bride uh with what is happening in the
[1:17:06] world that you are living
[1:17:10] in together but you need to know those
[1:17:14] pains started from the first world
[1:17:20] war maybe we will continue here maybe
[1:17:23] let's have that screen I mean that uh
[1:17:28] slide that shows the the the different
[1:17:33] Idols yeah that
[1:17:37] one you you see it's about seven Church
[1:17:41] ages churches uh each and every Church
[1:17:45] age had an image
[1:17:50] chur an
[1:17:51] image uh which which which which is is
[1:17:55] an
[1:17:57] idol and they had also a
[1:18:00] temple in laia they had an image of
[1:18:07] Diana they had a
[1:18:09] temple where they worship
[1:18:14] Diana and differently you see all those
[1:18:19] images those were the idols that were
[1:18:22] woried
[1:18:25] in different
[1:18:29] cities but now
[1:18:31] God was showing that each and every
[1:18:36] age has
[1:18:38] God an
[1:18:41] idol a
[1:18:43] temple now let's go to ours the seventh
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:50] one yeah how do you pronounce that I
[1:18:53] always say Z but I understand they
[1:19:00] said yeah Z or whatever it is you know
[1:19:05] that is the Devil
[1:19:08] Himself so which means
[1:19:12] during the devil will be
[1:19:15] worshiped right now you know very
[1:19:20] well that the
[1:19:22] law is not against you worshiping the
[1:19:29] dev and then is not even against you
[1:19:32] building a
[1:19:37] temple but if you could
[1:19:39] look what is happening in
[1:19:43] laia not with the
[1:19:45] bride

[1:20:16] attracted by
[1:20:19] laisha they're dragging their
[1:20:22] feet some have already
[1:20:27] crossed last time I read you a
[1:20:31] code where the Prophet says it's for
[1:20:35] special
[1:20:39] people together now now you see now the
[1:20:43] the last Church
[1:20:45] age the king is the
[1:20:49] devil can I have that other slide
[1:20:55] just just to give you an example of of
[1:20:57] of of where we are remember now
[1:21:00] laia is the Devil
[1:21:02] Himself we waiting for the bride to
[1:21:09] go they are waiting for the bride to
[1:21:13] go so that they could do their
[1:21:16] things right the prophet
[1:21:19] here explain about the first three
[1:21:21] Church ages
[1:21:24] the first the second and the
[1:21:27] third that it was an
[1:21:31] antichrist as it
[1:21:34] continues it became the false
[1:21:38] prophet then as it
[1:21:41] continues it became a
[1:21:44] VI now in
[1:21:48] the it's a
[1:21:51] beast we are living in the time of the
[1:21:53] Beast
[1:21:55] but that piece will
[1:22:00] overl after the Rapture you will see the
[1:22:04] color of the
[1:22:06] beast but he has already
[1:22:10] here now when I'm talking about the
[1:22:13] Beast I'm not talking about

[1:23:16] because we are at the
[1:23:21] end you know when Jesus Christ
[1:23:25] said the one that will
[1:23:28] dip the bread with me
[1:23:33] here it was at the
[1:23:37] end if you don't have the spirit of
[1:23:42] resistance there will be another spirit
[1:23:45] that will take your hand and you'll

[1:26:33] must uh give
[1:26:36] birth to another
[1:26:39] world that's the reason she's so
[1:26:46] nervous we were living with
[1:26:49] people that are very
[1:26:52] nervous they are not settled
[1:26:56] they even take
[1:27:00] drugs do you know now that some of the
[1:27:03] drugs like
[1:27:06] dag has been
[1:27:13] legalized you can
[1:27:15] smoke until you are
[1:27:18] satisfied now your nerves
[1:27:24] because their nerves are are not in a
[1:27:27] stable
[1:27:28] condition he says they are so
[1:27:32] nervous they will take drugs to try and
[1:27:34] come their
[1:27:39] nerv they take they attacked by
[1:27:43] demons and then they they are given
[1:27:48] right to negotiate with the demons
[1:27:55] even at
[1:27:58] schools you cannot lay hand Upon a
[1:28:03] Child no lay hand in in terms of
[1:28:08] praying who is attacked by by an evil
[1:28:13] spirit they would say no it's an
[1:28:17] abuse that spirit is from their
[1:28:23] ancestors AB their
[1:28:28] ancestors to you is a demon you want to
[1:28:32] chase
[1:28:33] it to them it's a never
[1:28:40] system right
[1:28:43] amen it's towards the time of
[1:28:48] Deliverance
[1:28:50] remember Jesus when it was the time
[1:28:54] when now he had to
[1:29:00] deliver because the
[1:29:02] pleasure was very
[1:29:04] much was attacked left and
[1:29:07] right are we together until he
[1:29:14] said why did you leave
[1:29:17] me God will never leave
[1:29:21] you that is why there an angel from
[1:29:26] heaven that is why there is an angel
[1:29:30] from
[1:29:33] heaven are we
[1:29:35] together when when when brother Bram
[1:29:39] went
[1:29:40] to he met an
[1:29:42] angel and he would say this Angel is a
[1:29:47] human being he very
[1:29:50] nice he says I know him now speaking
[1:29:53] about Angel says I know
[1:29:57] him he's just a human
[1:29:59] being now you are waiting for a angel
[1:30:04] that will come
[1:30:07] flying that angel is the word of God
[1:30:11] that is in
[1:30:13] you but that word of God needs to be
[1:30:19] applied by a man like yourself
[1:30:27] the Bible
[1:30:28] said he became a
[1:30:31] man and then when he became a
[1:30:34] man and then that's why I said
[1:30:37] now the
[1:30:40] word will produce a
[1:30:44] weight in the end time the we give it
[1:30:48] birth to the
[1:30:52] we amen now the true word of
[1:30:56] God must be made
[1:31:00] flesh the true word of
[1:31:03] God
[1:31:05] God must become
[1:31:10] us and we must be
[1:31:16] him now within us we have a
[1:31:21] child without a human father
[1:31:25] within you there is a child without a
[1:31:30] human
[1:31:32] father you have to recognize that that
[1:31:38] child because it's the revelation of the
[1:31:40] word
[1:31:44] of that is the one that will say even
[1:31:49] so but your
[1:31:51] mind your way of living
[1:31:54] look at the
[1:31:56] world and it it will attract
[1:31:59] you but there's one within
[1:32:03] you that will see with another
[1:32:10] ey right now she knows that her time of
[1:32:14] Deliverance is at
[1:32:18] hand that's why she's so
[1:32:22] nervous FL
[1:32:27] because that there is an oxygen
[1:32:34] bomb it's no more just a
[1:32:38] bomb it's an oxygen
[1:32:42] bomb or I mean
[1:32:48] hydrogen H it's a there's
[1:32:51] misiles not machine gun I machine gun no
[1:32:56] there
[1:32:59] missiles and then there's Rockets
[1:33:04] rocket there's drones drone they don't
[1:33:08] run around with a with a gun they send a
[1:33:12] drone and control
[1:33:17] it if they want to destroy
[1:33:20] you they just a drone just an ordinary
[1:33:23] drone
[1:33:25] go through your
[1:33:28] window and
[1:33:31] explode so people are
[1:33:36] never there hydrogen bomb there
[1:33:41] missiles to destroy the
[1:33:44] world one
[1:33:46] nation is scared of the other
[1:33:51] one no matter how little it
[1:33:58] there's bomb all over you know about
[1:34:02] it they got those
[1:34:04] missiles they claim just one of them
[1:34:07] said they can direct them by the
[1:34:12] stars and drop them anywhere in the
[1:34:19] world so now
[1:34:24] in paragraph 93 he says people's science
[1:34:30] has
[1:34:31] broke into God's Great
[1:34:40] laboratory until they going to destroy
[1:34:46] themselves they want to create a human
[1:34:50] being or they want to create an animal
[1:34:55] now they are getting
[1:34:57] into God's Great
[1:35:02] laboratory they try cloning and doing
[1:35:05] all
[1:35:06] the the laboratory of
[1:35:09] God God just spoke the
[1:35:12] word and things came into
[1:35:17] existence
[1:35:20] amen now the
[1:35:22] world know knows that you must give
[1:35:26] way she knows that she must give
[1:35:30] way she cannot stand
[1:35:33] it in paragraph 95 he
[1:35:37] says so the world knows that her birth
[1:35:41] pains is so
[1:35:45] great she's going to give
[1:35:49] away there's going to be a new B
[1:35:55] at
[1:35:57] hand you see amen now if there's going
[1:36:00] to be a new BET at
[1:36:04] hand it's
[1:36:07] because the
[1:36:09] world
[1:36:13] must amen she's actually she's totally
[1:36:16] Wroten if you read paragraph
[1:36:21] 96 politics
[1:36:25] her
[1:36:28] systems the prophet says there's no
[1:36:30] sound bone in
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:36] her the world
[1:36:39] system is Wroten to the
[1:36:45] call
[1:36:47] politics religious
[1:36:50] politics that's how it is
[1:36:54] there's only one thing that can help
[1:37:00] her that's the coming of the
[1:37:06] Lord so are you together so it's only
[1:37:10] the coming of the
[1:37:13] Lord that can
[1:37:16] help now how is it going to help
[1:37:21] us is that now we
[1:37:25] have to link
[1:37:29] family and the only way to link
[1:37:33] family is to have a
[1:37:37] ministry right amen the
[1:37:40] ministry of the time that we
[1:37:44] living and that
[1:37:46] Ministry is the revelation of the seven
[1:37:50] SE and the revelation of the seven seed
[1:37:54] it's Christ
[1:37:56] himself you are the Seed of
[1:37:59] Abraham being the Seed of
[1:38:02] Abraham in faith so then if you a Seed
[1:38:07] of Abraham in
[1:38:09] faith then you need to have a rapturing
[1:38:12] faith in
[1:38:18] you that's that's what we call a mystery
[1:38:23] it's a it's it's God and man
[1:38:28] combined they become one
[1:38:31] thing so
[1:38:34] now let's go to the book of of of of
[1:38:38] John chapter 6 Johan
[1:38:41] 6 let's go to verse 35 verse
[1:38:49] 35 but before before before we go to
[1:38:52] that one
[1:38:54] I I would like us
[1:38:57] to yeah but let's go to that
[1:39:00] one John
[1:39:03] 6:35 and Jesus said unto them I am the
[1:39:06] bread of life he that cometh to me shall
[1:39:09] never hunger and he that believeth on me
[1:39:13] shall never
[1:39:14] thirst amen then uh can you read
[1:39:19] 51
[1:39:22] 51 I am the living bread which came down
[1:39:25] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[1:39:29] he shall live
[1:39:30] forever and the bread that I will give
[1:39:34] is my flesh which I will give for the
[1:39:36] life of the
[1:39:39] world now if that one you don't have to
[1:39:41] read I'll quote it if you you read you
[1:39:44] you read John
[1:39:46] 663 John 663 it says it is the spirit
[1:39:50] that quickeneth
[1:39:54] right the flesh profited
[1:39:57] nothing the words that I
[1:40:01] speak unto
[1:40:04] you they are
[1:40:06] spirit and they are love says now the
[1:40:10] words that I speak unto
[1:40:12] you they are Spirit remember there was a
[1:40:17] time where he gave them
[1:40:21] bread and say they must eat
[1:40:24] then he said that is his
[1:40:26] flesh and gave them wine said they must
[1:40:30] drink that is his
[1:40:33] Spirit after that one day he said if you
[1:40:38] don't eat my
[1:40:40] flesh and drink my
[1:40:43] blood then you are not
[1:40:47] worthy right amen and then he did not
[1:40:51] explain that
[1:40:53] you just leave that until some
[1:40:55] interpreted it
[1:41:00] wrongly okay it's not the first time
[1:41:02] that I'm telling you
[1:41:04] this the word of
[1:41:06] God when you read
[1:41:08] it the Bible says in Ephesians 1 17 it
[1:41:14] says that
[1:41:15] now God will give you a
[1:41:18] spirit and that spirit will be able to
[1:41:22] interpret what you've been reading
[1:41:28] about what what is
[1:41:31] important is that now you don't need an
[1:41:36] understanding you need a
[1:41:41] revelation now a revelation you get it
[1:41:44] from
[1:41:46] God are we together amen now when you
[1:41:50] read or when you sit down and listen to
[1:41:55] any preacher
[1:41:56] speaking there could be some other
[1:41:59] things that will go above your
[1:42:04] head that is why God gave us a
[1:42:09] spirit now that Spirit communicate with
[1:42:12] the spirit and even that verse whenever
[1:42:15] I preach I quote
[1:42:18] it in in in in in in in uh uh Romans
[1:42:22] 8:16
[1:42:24] speaking about your
[1:42:27] spirit and his
[1:42:29] Spirit linking
[1:42:33] together right amen and then when it
[1:42:35] link
[1:42:37] together and then it it comes to a
[1:42:43] point like if you read who is this
[1:42:49] MC in paragraph 54 it says
[1:42:53] then the the attribute was first God he
[1:42:57] was God
[1:42:58] himself but but you miss that one and
[1:43:02] then you miss the
[1:43:05] godhead once you miss the
[1:43:08] godhead you are excommunicating yourself
[1:43:11] from that
[1:43:13] one because when when he was is going to
[1:43:18] say I and my father
[1:43:21] one then is you want to say again in
[1:43:25] that day you shall know then you'll have
[1:43:29] a problem to
[1:43:31] know because he says in that day you
[1:43:33] shall know that I am in the
[1:43:38] father now when he was in the
[1:43:41] father he was the only one that
[1:43:43] understand that he's in the
[1:43:47] father him and the
[1:43:50] father that is why whatever was doing
[1:43:55] he could not explain
[1:43:56] them he cannot explain how he walk upon
[1:44:00] the
[1:44:03] sea he cannot explain
[1:44:06] how he multiplied the
[1:44:11] bread because it was not yet
[1:44:15] time it's not science where you could
[1:44:18] say I've taken this and mix that one
[1:44:24] then Peter saw him walking upon the
[1:44:27] sea He said Come
[1:44:30] Peter and Peter walked upon
[1:44:32] the but because it was not yet
[1:44:35] time he started
[1:44:38] sinking then there was a time where he
[1:44:41] CED the
[1:44:44] sea now he cannot sit down and say if
[1:44:47] you want to come the se you must do 1 2
[1:44:50] 3
[1:44:55] then when you receive a
[1:44:57] revelation there's no book that is
[1:45:00] written how to receive a
[1:45:05] revelation at its right time you will
[1:45:09] receive
[1:45:10] it that is why the Bible says that is
[1:45:14] your new
[1:45:16] name be known by you
[1:45:20] only now you have now a Supernatural
[1:45:26] understanding it won't be a normal
[1:45:29] one and the hidden part of it you cannot
[1:45:33] explain it to somebody
[1:45:37] else Paul went to heaven and came back
[1:45:42] and save for 14
[1:45:45] years because he could not explain it to
[1:45:50] somebody are we together brother Bram
[1:45:53] brother went beyond the C of
[1:45:57] time and in coming back when he tried to
[1:46:01] explain you you will hear you will see
[1:46:04] it in portion you could not
[1:46:08] understand because you have to be
[1:46:11] there and you you have to have the
[1:46:14] quality of going
[1:46:18] there now the
[1:46:21] revelation of the word
[1:46:23] in you it should be you that knows
[1:46:29] it God reveals it but to you why because
[1:46:35] he gave it to
[1:46:36] Adam and the devil wanted to take
[1:46:40] it so God took it back to
[1:46:44] himself when took it back to himself he
[1:46:47] brought it in a
[1:46:49] way that the devil cannot C
[1:46:53] because it must go directly to
[1:46:58] you and you must
[1:47:00] fail to explain to
[1:47:05] somebody because it has got its own
[1:47:09] channel whoever wants
[1:47:12] it must get to that
[1:47:16] channel and that channel is the seventh
[1:47:21] scene you reject
[1:47:24] because that seven SE is Christ
[1:47:28] himself the
[1:47:30] mystery it's of Christ now if you want
[1:47:33] to know it you must be
[1:47:37] Christ right and Christ must be
[1:47:41] you I that's why I always
[1:47:44] say Abraham abah became
[1:47:48] Elohim Elohim became himself
[1:47:53] brother Bram saw a notable
[1:47:56] one he became that
[1:47:59] notable that
[1:48:01] not when they say it flew into
[1:48:05] him it's not
[1:48:09] physically no he became that
[1:48:13] angel that angel became
[1:48:17] himself now how are you going to explain
[1:48:20] that if I'm going to say I became
[1:48:24] God and God became myself you going to
[1:48:28] take me
[1:48:31] to
[1:48:33] definitely because you still see
[1:48:37] God as another being you don't see him
[1:48:43] potentially that he is a man and is in
[1:48:47] you now the problem is God goes to man
[1:48:53] and the
[1:48:54] man uh
[1:48:57] Retreats because he says God is so
[1:49:02] great that is why here
[1:49:04] now
[1:49:06] Philip said show us the
[1:49:13] father when he said show us the
[1:49:18] father uh brother Bram explained that
[1:49:23] I I'll get you that that good
[1:49:25] because if you could uh read
[1:49:31] about Elijah and
[1:49:36] Elish as as they were
[1:49:40] going
[1:49:44] Elisha was gunning or he was enticed or
[1:49:49] was attracted
[1:49:53] by what was
[1:49:55] in
[1:49:58] Elijah that is why he
[1:50:01] says uh it speaks about the the
[1:50:05] S I speaking about the
[1:50:09] soul because he would say as the Lord
[1:50:14] leaveth and my soul or your
[1:50:18] soul you see he's speaking about this
[1:50:21] there's something that was
[1:50:24] attracting now he kept on
[1:50:28] following until that very same
[1:50:32] thing flew into
[1:50:35] him he became that thing when he came
[1:50:39] back he was he was now the very same
[1:50:42] thing that he was following
[1:50:46] am now how if you look at the church
[1:50:50] ages there is no
[1:50:54] period that is like this one and there
[1:50:59] will never be a
[1:51:01] period after that that will be like this
[1:51:05] one there is
[1:51:08] nobody there is no other bride that will
[1:51:11] come next
[1:51:15] time the bright is this
[1:51:19] one are you two together amen now now he
[1:51:23] is is speaking here about that we we we
[1:51:26] we are the
[1:51:29] attributes now if we are the
[1:51:34] attributes let me read you something
[1:51:36] that you you you you you already
[1:51:41] know
[1:51:43] attributes the final
[1:51:46] end when Abraham met
[1:51:50] him he was m
[1:51:54] he unfolds here what all the
[1:52:00] attributes will do in the Final
[1:52:03] End every son of
[1:52:07] Abraham every son of the
[1:52:09] faith will absolutely do the same
[1:52:15] thing right amen the church has got its
[1:52:20] last sign
[1:52:23] it says and the church has got its last
[1:52:28] sign before the whole world is going to
[1:52:31] be
[1:52:34] destroyed this Gentile
[1:52:37] Kingdom be destroyed by
[1:52:41] fire and Roth of
[1:52:44] God that's what he says but what I want
[1:52:48] to read to you
[1:52:52] is is how he processed
[1:52:57] himself of of which you know
[1:53:00] that that now there is a way in which he
[1:53:04] processed
[1:53:05] himself just looking for that book right
[1:53:08] now there is a way in which he process
[1:53:11] himself mind you we said now Christ has
[1:53:15] left the
[1:53:18] church and when Christ has left the
[1:53:21] church
[1:53:24] so the
[1:53:25] church can never be
[1:53:29] right and
[1:53:32] until uh
[1:53:36] Rapture now we got a promised son
[1:53:41] ourself I want to read you about
[1:53:44] that there's something that has been
[1:53:46] promised
[1:53:48] here it's it's your son
[1:53:53] which is your
[1:53:55] Revelation let's read the book of 1
[1:53:59] Samuel
[1:54:04] 18:1 verse one 1 Samuel 18 verse
[1:54:10] one and it came to pass when he had made
[1:54:14] an end of speaking unto Saul that the
[1:54:17] spirit the soul of Jonathan was snit
[1:54:20] with the soul of David and Jonathan
[1:54:23] loved him as his own soul amen yeah here
[1:54:26] here the Bible speaks about the two
[1:54:32] Souls the soul of
[1:54:34] David and the soul of
[1:54:38] Jonathan they they came
[1:54:41] together and became one
[1:54:44] thing now if these Souls came together
[1:54:47] I'm just giving you an
[1:54:49] example your soul and the soul of God
[1:54:53] have to come
[1:54:55] together and become one thing when we
[1:54:58] say you are a potential
[1:55:02] God we're referring to your
[1:55:05] soul
[1:55:08] is of god remember when God formed the
[1:55:15] Men Out of the Dust of the earth he gave
[1:55:18] that man Life by by by by by uh uh
[1:55:23] uh through the
[1:55:27] spirit are we together then after that
[1:55:31] God took his own
[1:55:34] soul and gave it to
[1:55:36] Adam the soul of Adam and the soul
[1:55:42] of became one thing that is why now God
[1:55:46] I
[1:55:48] mean Adam Adam was operating from that
[1:55:54] level he he can call things into
[1:55:58] existence can shift Rivers into
[1:56:01] different
[1:56:04] direction but the Bible says the evening
[1:56:08] time God will visit his
[1:56:11] son Abraham was
[1:56:14] God Adam was

[1:56:33] God took everything and gave it to his
[1:56:37] son are together amen and then Abraham
[1:56:40] could do that it's exactly what is
[1:56:45] happening with us God took
[1:56:49] everything and gave it to us
[1:56:53] in Romans
[1:56:54] 8 in verse 19 verse the Bible says
[1:56:59] speaks
[1:57:00] about the creatures that are waiting for
[1:57:04] the manifestations of the sons of
[1:57:10] God waiting for the
[1:57:14] manifestation waiting
[1:57:16] for
[1:57:19] us to receive our inheritance
[1:57:24] and what is our
[1:57:26] inheritance our inheritance is
[1:57:30] Christ and if our inheritance is of our
[1:57:33] inheritance is
[1:57:36] Christ that's what the creature is
[1:57:38] waiting
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:41] for because the present
[1:57:44] world is an operation to
[1:57:49] them right yeah
[1:57:53] he says this spoken the first
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:58] C paragraph 361 I'm I'm
[1:58:03] closing now
[1:58:06] notice at the end
[1:58:08] time at the end of the church ages
[1:58:13] now he and his
[1:58:16] children are called the Antichrist
[1:58:22] because anything that's against Christ
[1:58:28] Antichrist and
[1:58:30] anything is against the
[1:58:34] word is against
[1:58:36] Christ because Christ is called the
[1:58:41] we
[1:58:43] now paragraph 36
[1:58:47] says when Satan is cast out
[1:58:53] which is which is the
[1:58:56] accuser you want to put that down that's
[1:58:58] what he
[1:59:00] says the devil which is up there
[1:59:04] now accuser of our
[1:59:08] Brethren when the church is taken
[1:59:13] up and Satan is cast
[1:59:17] out and when the church goes up
[1:59:22] Satan comes
[1:59:24] down and Satan incarnate himself in the
[1:59:30] Antichrist which is called
[1:59:33] Beast you hear what is going
[1:59:36] on now there is a birth
[1:59:40] paint we have to change our
[1:59:45] bodies and here on Earth the angels of
[1:59:49] the
[1:59:50] devil are already already
[1:59:53] here you heard
[1:59:55] about the
[1:59:59] river and at the same
[2:00:02] time the
[2:00:04] investigating angel of
[2:00:08] God are already
[2:00:11] here together now the angels that bound
[2:00:16] on the river
[2:00:20] euphrat already
[2:00:24] started are we together now the best
[2:00:28] pains that you see in the
[2:00:31] world are not done by human
[2:00:35] beings B by the angels of the
[2:00:40] dev the Prophet The Prophet
[2:00:42] says in the second world
[2:00:46] war it was those spirits that were in
[2:00:49] the river euph
[2:00:52] were released tempor not all of
[2:00:58] them if you could see the bombs that are
[2:01:02] flying if you could see the killings
[2:01:05] that are going
[2:01:07] on see that these things are
[2:01:15] demonic it's demonic demon now it's the
[2:01:19] birth pains and now if there is the the
[2:01:22] angel of the
[2:01:25] devil absolutely they should be the
[2:01:27] angel of
[2:01:30] [Applause]
