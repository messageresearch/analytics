[31:21] [Applause]
[31:25] amen amen I'd like
[31:28] to greet Saints in the name of our Lord
[31:31] and Savior Jesus
[31:34] Christ it's been a while
[31:36] amen since I've had a mic in my
[31:42] hand I'm shaking as it
[31:48] is I had
[31:51] asked I see there's a
[31:55] scripture that I wanted to sh with the
[31:57] children of
[31:59] God it's about Joshua the high
[32:05] priest standing before the angel of the
[32:08] Lord and Satan standing at his right
[32:12] hand to resist
[32:14] [Music]
[32:19] him I was blessed that it did not end
[32:23] there but it says the angel
[32:29] rebuked Satan
[32:32] amen a few weeks ago we we sang a song
[32:35] that the Lord is coming all the time
[32:37] he's coming all the time so it really
[32:39] blessed my heart that even Joshua was
[32:43] standing there it says with filthy
[32:47] garments but God came through for him
[32:51] amen so we we know what we have done
[32:54] with our lives we went
[32:58] astray we know these things amen and he
[33:01] always comes to challenge to remind you
[33:05] that who are you who do you think you
[33:08] are to stand
[33:10] before
[33:12] sing but I thank God having listening
[33:16] to sometimes you need to
[33:19] pause and
[33:21] think about this great king of salale
[33:27] who came
[33:29] down
[33:31] as Our Redeemer amen our
[33:35] Kingsman to save us amen so from
[33:39] there I I felt the spirit of gratitude
[33:43] amen and this thought came to my mind
[33:46] that a
[33:49] worshiper is a
[33:51] Believer with a sense of
[33:55] appreciation amen
[33:58] a worshipper is a Believer with a sense
[34:01] of appreciation it's not what you have
[34:04] done but what God has done for
[34:09] us
[34:11] amen so I thought let me just worship
[34:14] God and appreciate him and
[34:17] say
[34:19] so I'm
[34:21] your
[34:24] lord

[1:54:06] hour amen you may be
[1:54:17] seated okay amen
[1:54:22] now I promised
[1:54:24] you you know in the book we realized
[1:54:31] that uh when he opened the sixth
[1:54:40] s uh we see
[1:54:43] mes and elah
[1:54:47] amen when he opened the six
[1:54:52] and very soon according to
[1:55:04] the
[1:55:07] Elijah will appear on M
[1:55:13] Transfiguration you can
[1:55:15] see what is happening
[1:55:18] today
[1:55:21] and uh those who were there before the
[1:55:25] foundation of the
[1:55:30] world maybe one can
[1:55:36] say let me answer you with Ephesians
[1:55:40] chapter 4
[1:55:45] there amen we talking into the
[1:55:53] perfect now a perfect
[1:55:57] man is a man who has eternal
[1:56:02] life and a man who has eternal
[1:56:07] life didn't appear when he was
[1:56:13] born he was there
[1:56:17] before in the mind of God
[1:56:20] amen for what did it
[1:56:23] say Ephesians 1 verse
[1:56:27] 4 according as he ha chosen Us in him
[1:56:30] before the foundation of the world do we
[1:56:33] start it there or
[1:56:36] where
[1:56:39] yes yes chapter 1
[1:56:43] verse4 apply the first
[1:56:46] GE from verse one Paul Paul an apostle
[1:56:50] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[1:56:53] the Saints which are at Ephesus grieve
[1:56:55] not oh sorry gri chter 4: 13
[1:57:03] amen grieve
[1:57:05] not amen the holy spirit amen and grief
[1:57:09] not the holy spirit of God whereby he
[1:57:12] are sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:57:15] amen right amen said unto the day
[1:57:21] of
[1:57:23] redemption you know when I read here it
[1:57:27] tells me that the day of
[1:57:30] redemption is the day the book was
[1:57:36] open because if you are
[1:57:39] redeemed your name is in the Book of
[1:57:43] Life or the Lamb's Book of
[1:57:48] Life two types here we have the Book of
[1:57:52] Life the L book of
[1:57:56] life now the Bible
[1:57:59] clearly shows
[1:58:02] that those in the Book of
[1:58:05] Life on the day of
[1:58:10] judgment they will come
[1:58:13] through judgment
[1:58:17] SE and they will be saved according to
[1:58:21] their good
[1:58:25] works but those in the Lamb's Book of
[1:58:30] Life have already passed from
[1:58:34] judgment God has already judged
[1:58:38] them and they were found to
[1:58:42] be
[1:58:45] righteous you know when he
[1:58:48] died
[1:58:50] uh he shed his own
[1:58:54] blood because no other
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:58:59] blood we are all
[1:59:02] sinners don't be
[1:59:04] deceived we were all born
[1:59:09] Sinners and we are all being
[1:59:13] called since I
[1:59:17] cannot uh
[1:59:19] get rid of my
[1:59:22] sins that's why he
[1:59:25] came to shed his own
[1:59:29] blood amen amen and then it says when he
[1:59:35] shed his
[1:59:38] blood his
[1:59:40] blood became his word in
[1:59:44] me and
[1:59:47] you without him you are not
[1:59:53] the day is coming in very
[1:59:56] near when all shall stand before
[2:00:01] him be it a king or
[2:00:04] whoever will all stand before
[2:00:08] him and the Bible says the books will be
[2:00:13] open amen amen and those whose
[2:00:18] name were found in the in the Book of
[2:00:23] Life they shall come through the
[2:00:26] judgment to be judged according to their
[2:00:30] words but those in the L's Book of
[2:00:35] Life he has judged
[2:00:39] already and they were found to
[2:00:42] be without any
[2:00:46] sin amen amen amen amen because he was
[2:00:50] found without any
[2:00:55] sin now
[2:00:57] Redemption that's why the word
[2:01:01] Redemption speaks of
[2:01:04] something to redeem
[2:01:06] it is to take it to its
[2:01:13] original if you are in
[2:01:17] him it says according as he has chosen
[2:01:22] us
[2:01:26] when before the
[2:01:30] foundation amen
[2:01:33] amen the
[2:01:35] world that's why if you are in
[2:01:38] Christ you overcome the
[2:01:43] world and the things of the
[2:01:45] world because things of the world they
[2:01:48] come and
[2:01:50] go but those who are in
[2:01:54] him have eternal
[2:01:57] life eternal life is a life that will
[2:02:01] never
[2:02:04] end well life come into
[2:02:09] pass you have life here on
[2:02:12] Earth we shall pass
[2:02:15] away amen amen that's why when I was
[2:02:20] born H the parents
[2:02:23] considered
[2:02:27] Insurance burial
[2:02:31] insurance they know
[2:02:33] that I am
[2:02:35] born in order
[2:02:39] to they know that I'm passing
[2:02:43] on when a child is born the parents know
[2:02:48] that they start to
[2:02:50] prepare for the child's
[2:02:55] death you all
[2:02:57] know amen amen because what they
[2:03:01] expect is that we are B he is born to
[2:03:07] die because that is part of the
[2:03:11] Earth all right amen that's why when a
[2:03:15] child is born the family starts to think
[2:03:18] about the future of the
[2:03:21] child some Slaughter
[2:03:24] GH and so for and but in Christ Jesus we
[2:03:33] don't need a
[2:03:35] go because we are passing
[2:03:40] on when you are born and you are
[2:03:44] predestinated you are
[2:03:47] chosen in him before the foundation of
[2:03:50] the
[2:03:52] world when you are born is just to say
[2:03:55] hello and
[2:03:57] [Applause]
[2:03:59] goodbye amen amen because you you did
[2:04:04] not
[2:04:05] originate from this
[2:04:09] country here you are a
[2:04:14] so amen amen and
[2:04:17] uh
[2:04:22] sometimes now if you are you have the
[2:04:27] mind of
[2:04:28] Christ you know that you are not here
[2:04:35] eternally now I can prove to you that
[2:04:39] when a child is
[2:04:40] born they come with
[2:04:46] predictions like this s we have said
[2:04:49] seen this
[2:04:52] before I I have learned
[2:04:56] something from the not only whites but
[2:05:00] from some
[2:05:04] parents when a child is
[2:05:07] born you know some somay come with
[2:05:12] predictions but in this manner I want
[2:05:15] this child to be like his uncle
[2:05:21] and become a a a a a medical
[2:05:25] doctor
[2:05:27] but the others they don't do it that
[2:05:32] way I was
[2:05:34] taught that
[2:05:37] they purchase
[2:05:40] some dolls and what what
[2:05:45] what you
[2:05:47] know what do you call them toys
[2:05:52] toy
[2:05:55] then
[2:05:58] like they take this
[2:06:02] choice and spread them before they are
[2:06:06] children and sit
[2:06:08] back now each and every
[2:06:12] child will show a
[2:06:15] sign that's in
[2:06:17] her
[2:06:20] you watch him playing he going to make a
[2:06:24] choice out of this Choice he will start
[2:06:27] to place use maybe use the the doctor's
[2:06:32] type
[2:06:34] of then the parents will look at
[2:06:38] you to see that this
[2:06:41] child every
[2:06:44] morning
[2:06:45] he his
[2:06:47] kind
[2:06:49] of Joy playing and
[2:06:51] all is with the
[2:06:59] doctors amen amen then they study them
[2:07:03] and they see this one loves
[2:07:06] C loves this when they grow up now they
[2:07:11] have already
[2:07:14] seen what's in this
[2:07:17] children it's a thing of saying I want
[2:07:21] him to be like his brother I want to
[2:07:25] like it must come out of the
[2:07:30] chur they must see it in
[2:07:34] him then they know
[2:07:37] that uh when they take the child to
[2:07:41] school they have already seen what is in
[2:07:44] the
[2:07:46] church amen un like
[2:07:56] us that thing is not in
[2:08:00] him or
[2:08:03] in they push him to
[2:08:06] school then he will
[2:08:09] struggle that was not in
[2:08:14] him that's why
[2:08:17] Christianity saw as he says as we were
[2:08:22] chosen in
[2:08:24] him you are in him this
[2:08:27] morning because you are chosen in
[2:08:31] him amen
[2:08:33] amen before the foundation of the
[2:08:37] world God knew all of us
[2:08:42] here and he knew that this one would go
[2:08:45] that
[2:08:47] way that
[2:08:49] way before the foundation of the world
[2:08:53] the almighty God knew that you would be
[2:08:56] here this
[2:08:59] morning and he knew about your
[2:09:04] choice amen amen that's why to be
[2:09:08] redeemed is to be taken
[2:09:13] back all right amen now we were born
[2:09:17] sinners
[2:09:19] but after
[2:09:21] that the Redemption
[2:09:25] CA Redemption took its
[2:09:30] cause you were born to serve
[2:09:37] God Amen not like your
[2:09:40] uncle but as it was
[2:09:45] written he has chosen you before the
[2:09:49] foundation of the
[2:09:52] world amen amen amen the parents have
[2:09:57] seen the knowledge that is in
[2:10:01] you before they took you to

[2:10:14] reading about the seventh

[2:10:22] se when he open
[2:10:25] it not when he preach
[2:10:30] it
[2:10:32] and it was all
[2:10:37] silent okay amen
[2:10:41] because you look at things in this
[2:10:47] way when he opened the six
[2:10:52] seal what did we
[2:10:56] see Moses and
[2:10:58] Elijah that's when he opened the
[2:11:04] six and to prove to you
[2:11:08] that we saw Moses and
[2:11:11] Elijah it is because they will
[2:11:17] reappear in they
[2:11:20] theop on the mountain
[2:11:23] there and the time is drawing towards
[2:11:31] that you know last we were
[2:11:34] reading in the days of the Lord
[2:11:39] said of the end
[2:11:41] time they ask him about the sign
[2:11:46] the AM mean am then he said as it
[2:11:50] was in the days of
[2:11:53] Lord and in the days
[2:11:57] of all right
[2:11:59] amen actually my message
[2:12:03] today was supposed to
[2:12:06] be
[2:12:09] H that little that
[2:12:12] stone in the
[2:12:15] pyramid the white stone amen all right
[2:12:19] amen but now we have some
[2:12:24] activities we'll come back with
[2:12:27] that that white stone is very very it is
[2:12:32] closing this
[2:12:33] [Music]
[2:12:35] age I
[2:12:37] I we are coming with that I was just
[2:12:41] reading this part even this
[2:12:44] morning it
[2:12:46] says uh
[2:12:49] the message of the Seven
[2:12:53] Seals in their
[2:12:58] closing that's the the message of the
[2:13:01] entire
[2:13:05] Bible all right
[2:13:08] amen do you believe the
[2:13:12] Bible okay
[2:13:15] amen we spoke to I
[2:13:19] think some
[2:13:23] students it was not at the
[2:13:28] school they were
[2:13:30] asking
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:33] about
[2:13:35] ancestors ANC ANC
[2:13:42] yes I was with the brothers they will
[2:13:46] remember now I said what is this body
[2:13:51] now what is this
[2:13:52] ancestors who has created the
[2:13:57] Earth is it is it an all
[2:14:01] right then you know what
[2:14:05] happened when
[2:14:07] Jesus
[2:14:09] died the Bible
[2:14:11] says the
[2:14:13] graves when he
[2:14:16] resurrected the graves
[2:14:18] what happened to the graves open they
[2:14:23] open because he came the first sign he
[2:14:29] gave when he died the graves were
[2:14:36] open and the dead came
[2:14:41] out
[2:14:43] now he came with
[2:14:46] them because the Bible
[2:14:49] says H when he
[2:14:52] died
[2:14:54] his
[2:14:56] Spirit you know man is a
[2:14:59] soul and
[2:15:03] what his soul went
[2:15:07] down when he
[2:15:10] died and he came back time won't allow
[2:15:15] me to
[2:15:16] say
[2:15:18] but on the resurrection
[2:15:21] day he came back with those who died
[2:15:27] before and they died in the
[2:15:32] Lord so they were
[2:15:36] under because
[2:15:38] before they were under the the blood of
[2:15:44] goat but when Jesus died
[2:15:48] and shed his
[2:15:50] blood they rose up amen amen amen and
[2:15:56] they were no
[2:15:59] long
[2:16:01] under those
[2:16:05] priest where the blood of go would be
[2:16:11] HED yeah
[2:16:16] sacrif
[2:16:19] sacrificed his own
[2:16:22] son because the blood of
[2:16:25] ghost could not redeem
[2:16:30] us
[2:16:34] amen the blood of a
[2:16:39] goat they just make you be all the
[2:16:45] time the blood of Jesus
[2:16:49] is life
[2:16:52] amen that life is the
[2:16:57] way when he got to Mary Gabriel
[2:17:01] Gabriel when he spoke to Mary and Mary
[2:17:05] according to the word of the Prophet the
[2:17:07] angel
[2:17:10] Gabriel he accepted the
[2:17:14] word of God that
[2:17:16] came
[2:17:18] amen through that
[2:17:21] angel that's why we you will see next
[2:17:25] time we touch this white
[2:17:28] stone that the
[2:17:31] ministry comes through the
[2:17:36] prophet and at the end of
[2:17:39] it we see the the very same seventh
[2:17:44] angel
[2:17:46] messenger introduced
[2:17:49] the seventh
[2:17:52] angel so we follow this
[2:17:56] things from an
[2:18:00] angel in the Earthly
[2:18:02] body now we see
[2:18:06] Angel amen amen because you pass from
[2:18:09] this unto this
[2:18:13] amen all right amen there you listen
[2:18:18] the message message of the
[2:18:21] Seven
[2:18:23] Seals in their
[2:18:27] closing that's the message of the entire
[2:18:32] Bible the Seven
[2:18:36] Seals closes the New
[2:18:43] Testament that's
[2:18:45] why under the new
[2:18:49] Testament he was
[2:18:53] AI a
[2:18:55] mediator but when the seven seal was
[2:19:00] opened it says he is no
[2:19:04] longer a
[2:19:07] mediator that's why if he is no longer a
[2:19:12] mediator he was a mediator at the
[2:19:16] altar
[2:19:18] we supposed to he was supposed to
[2:19:21] forgive
[2:19:23] us
[2:19:25] us but after
[2:19:27] that he's no longer
[2:19:31] immediate that's why you see things
[2:19:33] happening the way
[2:19:36] they is no longer
[2:19:40] immediate amen all right amen he was a
[2:19:44] mediator now uh
[2:19:48] in the time like this when he is no
[2:19:52] longer
[2:19:54] immediat you come to
[2:19:57] him amen amen because we came under the
[2:20:01] shed
[2:20:08] blood why we see these things
[2:20:12] now when the the the the the New
[2:20:16] Testament
[2:20:19] is sealed
[2:20:20] up
[2:20:23] closed that was the
[2:20:28] blood when it is closed they
[2:20:33] predestinated they go
[2:20:37] forth then that's why the pyramid is now
[2:20:40] of the
[2:20:43] Angels because the the the Old Testament
[2:20:47] I mean the new test is
[2:20:52] closed closed by the seven
[2:20:57] SE amen amen amen now something else is
[2:21:01] open
[2:21:03] up you know God said to that was
[2:21:10] John is he the one yes he someone to
[2:21:14] come
[2:21:16] up
[2:21:18] after the seven Church
[2:21:21] churches which was the New
[2:21:24] Testament the New
[2:21:26] Testament now after the seven
[2:21:32] churches what is it now it's another
[2:21:38] ministry that's
[2:21:41] why we differ so
[2:21:44] much but I don't mean we
[2:21:50] differ we we have promoted differences
[2:21:54] no no no no each and every one of us has
[2:21:58] a certain
[2:22:02] nature if it is not the nature of God
[2:22:06] then is the nature of the evil
[2:22:09] one you can have two
[2:22:14] Natures when we are born we born
[2:22:19] Sinners be it a king or
[2:22:22] what but when we are born
[2:22:27] again amen amen the Bible says we are
[2:22:32] now we are at a new
[2:22:38] creation amen born
[2:22:41] again and the Bible say he that is born
[2:22:45] of
[2:22:46] God
[2:22:47] how many were born of
[2:22:51] God if he that is born of God sin is
[2:22:58] not sin is
[2:23:01] unbelief if you don't believe God then
[2:23:05] who has created
[2:23:09] you amen amen I'm
[2:23:14] closing so that's why the word said
[2:23:20] repent all of
[2:23:24] you Peter stood up and
[2:23:27] said therefore
[2:23:31] repent and do
[2:23:34] what and be
[2:23:37] baptized then you
[2:23:39] shall
[2:23:41] receive you get amen you won't receive
[2:23:45] it if you don't repent
[2:23:50] Man Without God is a very strange
[2:23:55] creature after being
[2:23:57] created by God he denies
[2:24:04] God that is something very
[2:24:07] strange even an
[2:24:10] animal after it is born it SWS the
[2:24:16] mother
[2:24:18] it has a
[2:24:20] revelation that I came from this
[2:24:26] one it starts to follow the
[2:24:30] M you look at
[2:24:34] chickens after their
[2:24:38] mother even an animal
[2:24:42] knows that I'm I came from this
[2:24:45] one
[2:24:47] but men don't know where
[2:24:54] he if you worship the
[2:24:57] dead that means you don't know where you
[2:24:59] came
[2:25:03] [Music]
[2:25:05] from to be
[2:25:07] ancestral is a spirit that rejected
[2:25:15] God hallelujah amen amen am but the real
[2:25:19] spirit of
[2:25:21] God tell you that I've seen animals been
[2:25:26] born the first thing it start to stand
[2:25:30] up it looks for
[2:25:34] mother because that
[2:25:37] where it came
[2:25:40] from
[2:25:42] amen amen amen originally everything is
[2:25:46] from God
[2:25:50] and God brings it down to the
[2:25:54] Earth
[2:25:56] like they say you should respect your
[2:26:03] mama because she was the first
[2:26:07] person to welcome
[2:26:11] you when you come into the
[2:26:14] world that was who was that
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:26] you'll hear them saying the day you were
[2:26:29] born your father was on his way to watch
[2:26:33] K Chiefs
[2:26:37] play he just received a sale to
[2:26:41] say m she's the first one to welcome you
[2:26:49] that's why you have Mother's
[2:26:53] Day and I see Mother's
[2:26:55] Day is more popular than Father's
[2:27:00] Day
[2:27:02] amen
[2:27:08] okay closing
[2:27:11] here that it
[2:27:13] is if we can respect
[2:27:18] ourly
[2:27:21] mly
[2:27:25] father and what about
[2:27:30] God the
[2:27:32] Creator who loved you so
[2:27:38] much when you are in
[2:27:41] sin
[2:27:44] defeated amen amen he
[2:27:47] came and took your own
[2:27:53] form and walk this
[2:27:56] world and as a king
[2:27:59] man that's why they call him the
[2:28:03] kingsman
[2:28:08] Redeemer who came even
[2:28:12] now you are
[2:28:15] here but yet
[2:28:18] but I let me point to
[2:28:20] myself while I'm standing here in a
[2:28:26] suit
[2:28:29] there's a coffin for
[2:28:32] me but it's not for me for my
[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:38] body there's no cofin for
[2:28:45] your it's for this body
[2:28:50] because some people they say it in this
[2:28:54] way that you are born to
[2:29:00] die that's why I'm losing that's why
[2:29:04] when you are
[2:29:07] born
[2:29:09] uh people
[2:29:11] people they differ in some
[2:29:14] things when one is
[2:29:17] born they come
[2:29:20] together the parents and
[2:29:24] so
[2:29:27] because they
[2:29:29] fear there's so much fear in this
[2:29:32] world that you'll find even a newborn
[2:29:38] baby already with some strings
[2:29:45] and arm do some
[2:29:51] ancest can a dead person
[2:29:59] help tell me that's why the world is
[2:30:02] like
[2:30:05] this the children are
[2:30:09] born KN not who created
[2:30:15] them
[2:30:17] all right let's look at this there's
[2:30:20] fear
[2:30:23] here that's why when we buy a
[2:30:29] car what comes in
[2:30:31] there insurance insurance insurance what
[2:30:36] else
[2:30:40] amen and
[2:30:45] yourself showing
[2:30:48] that you are born in a world that is not
[2:30:56] safe now the Rapture is
[2:31:00] coming after we have being
[2:31:04] ruptured we will
[2:31:07] arrive in
[2:31:09] that amen Heaven of
[2:31:14] Heavens that you don't need sexual
[2:31:22] I love the prophet when he
[2:31:24] says even traveling
[2:31:27] there you will travel like in your
[2:31:32] thought because in your
[2:31:37] thought you don't know where I come
[2:31:42] from but as I'm standing here I I see my
[2:31:49] house my
[2:31:51] everything my study room while standing
[2:31:56] you if I don't have that in my mind I
[2:32:01] will get lost when I leave
[2:32:08] this am but you for you to come to my
[2:32:14] house I'm a
[2:32:16] you must get air from me the direction
[2:32:20] GPS GPS
[2:32:22] location because you don't
[2:32:26] know that's why the Lord said the Jews
[2:32:30] day
[2:32:32] thees you don't know where I come
[2:32:36] from that's why you don't know where I'm
[2:32:41] going amen
[2:32:43] amen but to just uh
[2:32:47] disciples to his own he said where I go
[2:32:53] you
[2:32:57] know you
[2:33:02] see
[2:33:05] GPS
[2:33:08] one there was one driving
[2:33:13] us and was this
[2:33:17] woman saying after
[2:33:22] one left after
[2:33:27] this now the next
[2:33:30] thing he said after this 10
[2:33:36] right and we were driving straight
[2:33:40] into Bottle
[2:33:45] Store
[2:33:49] and I said yes it's not God
[2:33:54] guiding
[2:33:55] amen am but he said to
[2:34:00] his you know where I come
[2:34:04] from that's why they served him because
[2:34:08] they knew where he came
[2:34:11] [Applause]
[2:34:12] from and he said and you know where I am
[2:34:18] going that's why they followed
[2:34:21] him and Peter said where shall we
[2:34:26] go for the of
[2:34:30] Eternal are with
[2:34:34] you the weight
[2:34:37] of you know the weight of
[2:34:40] men can
[2:34:44] change amen and any
[2:34:46] time men can promise you
[2:34:50] something and tomorrow because
[2:34:56] you even forget I'm not
[2:35:00] buy I'm not buying that that is
[2:35:03] man but now with God it comes by
[2:35:09] predestination he has already
[2:35:13] done he came only to apply
[2:35:17] [Music]
[2:35:18] he said I knew
[2:35:20] you when before you were in your

[2:35:26] wom amen amen God didn't wait for your
[2:35:32] birth knew you
