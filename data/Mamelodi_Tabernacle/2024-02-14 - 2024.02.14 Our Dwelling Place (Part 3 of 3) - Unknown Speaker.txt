TRANSCRIPT
========================================
come she should make a contact and we are not just message believer we had something in us when the seven SE is opened we shall make a contact it's not a matter of hearing being a of iive am that's she a Conta is because the Lord Jesus had one part of [Music] it and the woman had another part you areed to you one with one part so that at the end of time he comes with that one part you know how how the prophet taugh us that one has one part and the other one has one part now it's one thing was T like this so you remain with one part and the thing is no other piece of paper can mat this so now he says well when he met keep your P when he met the woman that's when the two parts connected you know it was coming like this where is your husband and when Touch One you are a proph coming with one part seven Church ages the Lord coming with the Seven Seals amen am and when they connected I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here that's come wonderful you know Elijah Elijah had one part and because he touched elah El had another you know the Bible says El passed by El and touch then El he went and S his livestock he he s his came then he came to elij since that day he touch me and El his following amen amen and would say just remain here the Lord has sent me to Beth now El knowing that there's no way he could match that part amen so so he followed Jord after they Cross Jordan am so he cried out when El left and he said the Chariot of Israel amen he was calling out knowing that there's no way he could match that part that's why if the people come and say things I don't have a problem I just it with amen so now I'm told that now when a died they had the m and there was no one to match this this is the of el then it was wor by elishah anybody here who can elishah is is dead is there anyone that can match you see there was no one that's why brother knew that when he goes God has the toes God bless you amen so today you only have another part if you are predestinated time the pastor comes with the word comes to you amen amen the word don't come to the building word comes to you and when God comes to you you he comes to the heart so something must match that correspond Glory hallelu because there isres amen amen oh the Bible says the people don't know us the world don't know us because never knew him now I want to say today which we will leave it for the next day but come TOS with this says Christ is now made known in the church very well know you know one day I was preaching about light in the light and I said to the church inor that there's something in me but only that sometimes the people don't understand because as the pastors there is something in us apart from us amen and I will say to you that's why I cannot preach unless that other person is activated don't pre I can and today you will never hear the word of God unless you pick it [Music] up it's with your is the center point to pick up from God now let's close with this thing you listen here the it's now something that picked up the the up the church ages a word to a church Age The Seven Seals is the word I read the scripture here the Bible says Luke 3 the Bible says the word of God came to John now maybe we've got a little time we can look at it chapter 3 Book of John [Music] one it in Luke 3 okay I will read read inish okay now uh in the 15 year of the reign of tiia Cesar being governor of Judah and her being of gilee and his brother pH ofip and of the region of that's right trtic yeah and and the of ab I'm reading all right [Music] phas [Music] was addressed to John son of Zacharia in the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness now listen in the synagogue the services went on they preached their sermons it says the of God came to they preach their sermons in the syue there was the high Prest the word of God came to joh what did these others preach okay all right you see now and the word of God came to John in the wilderness just as the word of God came to brother was preaching you can name them stilling of God you understand so there were some great things [Music] movements worldwide but the word of God came now you see the now the bride of Christ received the word of God now those who heard John preaching heard the word of God because a couldn't take men to [Music] Jesus you know what when Jesus was walking the streets there in Jerusalem you pass by a synagogue amen and you'll hear them singing in the synagogue amen am Messiah is coming amen but the word of God the street you know understand what I mean people are singing Jesus is coming is coming amen amen then you pass by another syue sing all those things word of [Applause] God the word of God now the people the pastors now we have few genuine pastors few true pastors the ministry of the seventh angel message they are little El the mle of the Prophet amen because the prophet word theor must car the word amen am nothing else until the sons of the Prophet they said look the spirit of Elijah is upon El so I think it's time that the people should be able to see that was us amen because now not just to refer to brother but it's like this on the day of Pentecost Peter stood up and said these people are not drunk It's a prophecy [Music] proph what you see today noer a prophecy be in the so what the people are looking for of and he say know what to do with the that is the of Christ say the Lord ful it's not the prophet came and said this and that and that that's good and what as we said last I think ining I think it was I don't know the lamb took the book from him that said now he walked away with the book now you go to denominations they say hallelujah huj the book took the book and and and walked away amen so the has to know they just the Hallelujah the next thing is pray L but the bride saw the lamb when he took the book and they saw him coming amen because he took the book from theone of God which was in him and he was coming down to [Applause] another until they their am the secret is the took the book and I've got that book [Applause] now the that book because he took the book and restor it back to men again because it belong to men to Adam now the restoration the has to bring back the and praise God for the seven now I have and you know that people are still waiting for the L to to take the book we have the boie right in you have all right now what are you the Earthly Angel he preached the seven Church ages and the lamb open the now God said in the dispensation of time I will bring together that which is in heaven and brother was coming the angel also was coming of the Cen with a r the rainbow is a token of the Covenant so coming down with the rainbow there is no more immed the rainbow look you see every time you see the rainbow is in a half so but if you read Revelation chapter there you see a full rainbow the other part not come but when he come that means god the form of Christ is coming to meet God and Men [Music] met and when God and Men met messenger received the sword and he came to us and that way and after that he said now the [Music] is after he brought the word he says the Bri is prant that that is his [Music] way now can I read this last you listen Okay Okay the prophet now here I will read this book this will just be the last things we will continue now in this book here page words is Faith expressed he say you are a aun being now he says Insight which the prophet says the Insight of the Insight is the soul has one thing that's where you live amen amen so you live inside of you and that's where God dwells that is the place of God it say if you live that is where you live that's where the predestinated live in the soul why Satan can do nothing amen amen because he's Insight of the insight and God lives there so Satan can do nothing says the bride will be like Christ even even death cannot touch him forget about Sin talking about death before he can touch him must touch the husband you know one day sorry just 3 minutes one day a brother was visiting me so we put them in a bedroom now I was chatting with the brother I was talking with the and the wife was talking with my wife so she decided to go and sleep the wife of the brother now not knowing that the wife of the brother was in the bedroom already I I said to the brother let me show you where to sleep I was leading the brother to the bedroom and known to me that the brother knew that the wife was already asleep in the bedroom now as I tried to open the doors saying to him this will be your bedroom the brother just rush and said it's okay it's okay I want to show [Music] you then I realized after that the brother protected the bride was inside there with the of Christ have you seen how a pregnant woman she become so [Music] special she's well pried and she will start to you know to eat this and not this and that just like the bre of Christ you know we have started to be she has started to be [Music] selective you know she doesn't eat things like fishes from World she's a special because she's carrying a baby so she's very careful in walking and in doing things you will never see her with like this she's very careful I'm talking about the bride of Christ she's very careful she's not confused amen she loves her husband she's always with her husband because says in that condition become so sweet that's why the of Christ is so sweet because the Rapture the Rapture is about to take place that's that's that's where you live that is in your soul and the last thing again he says the same thing is where you live and in the book of the Rapture page he [Music] says down in the soul that's what you are you are what you are and who you are in the soul amen so we thank the Lord that is that place is the soul of man which is God's place and he says in that soul that and and the of God in the human form it didn't have I like you you see but a better vis a better a better if didn't have ears like you here amen am so and he says all that condescended in one thing and brother says he says now you see with the eyes of God you can see with the eyes of God because we looked at things not from [Applause] here but he says we stand on the the whole church and we were looking because no man has seen God at any time he says when we looked we saw that h of light that of Life something beond time right this is what joh saw to recognize Jesus a of this is what Abraham saw to see to recognize Elohim it was a of was watching it was watching saw stepped into human form it's wonderful and when it was in the human form Abraham sah bring bread and milk and honey isn't it wonderful the first thing saw and he was watching it coming and he was coming then into a man then he say sah prepare is a [Music] Manus said so shall it be amen as it into an ordinary man amen you can eat with that man can drink with him but you can at the same time recognize elim I saw the word of God so I recogniz that came down and that's when was coming to me and and said this because he was now here not not Jesus now Jesus is time a new priesthood the seven are under new priesthood and the prophet said is this and took him away amen Shalom to God shom God bless [Music] you
