[50:13] [Music]
[50:17] himself so because they should be unism
[50:21] they should unite these two
[50:28] the
[50:29] bride and the
[50:32] groom
[50:34] now the the unism or the harmony that is
[50:39] within
[50:42] them it's called the
[50:46] marriage you see
[50:50] naturally we have a
[50:53] marriage and then after marriage we have
[50:56] a
[50:59] ceremony so whatever we do here it types
[51:02] the Real
[51:04] [Music]
[51:08] Marriage now in in each and every
[51:13] marriage uh there is a
[51:16] proposal proposal propos proposal yeah
[51:21] the the two started proposing each other
[51:25] or or the bride proposed
[51:27] I mean the the groom proposed the
[51:33] bride then there's a agreement of the
[51:38] two now if there's that agreement of the
[51:43] two and then there's a time where now
[51:46] they they they unite and become
[51:52] one that that's what we call marriage

[52:37] understanding of actually what are you
[52:42] doing and then you become part of what
[52:45] is
[52:48] happening and then you
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] also have an understanding of the events
[52:57] that are
[53:02] happening because you are in a
[53:06] process from
[53:09] eternity to New
[53:12] Jerusalem now while you are in this
[53:17] journey you should know exactly where
[53:20] are
[53:22] you at this
[53:25] moment and and what speed are you
[53:27] traveling
[53:30] at and how far are
[53:35] you to reach your
[53:39] destination you see always the pastor
[53:45] types give give a type about the the
[53:49] flights
[53:53] of there's a time when it take
[53:58] off there's a certain speed that it
[54:01] [Music]
[54:05] takes and the
[54:08] force and then there's a time where now
[54:11] it's C
[54:16] cruising there's a cruising speed
[54:21] also and when it's going to land
[54:28] and okay there will be the disturbance
[54:31] of the velocity of the
[54:36] Winds but the
[54:40] pilot is not disturbed
[54:43] [Music]
[54:43] [Applause]
[54:44] about then as he's going to
[54:51] land there is some other things that
[54:53] will be happening
[54:56] the
[54:57] speed and the
[54:59] force and
[55:02] everything now we are a
[55:05] bride not the
[55:08] church now I'll will show you the
[55:12] difference so now what I want us to
[55:15] Fellowship
[55:19] about is this
[55:23] marriage this coordination between us
[55:26] and our
[55:30] God when we say this is a
[55:35] marriage actually what is
[55:39] it how how do
[55:41] we get
[55:44] together us and
[55:47] God are we
[55:50] together now there should be some events
[55:56] that will be leading to the final
[56:02] day uh that unites the two
[56:07] together the bride and the
[56:12] [Music]
[56:13] groom there
[56:15] are some prophetic
[56:20] visions that brother Bram had you know
[56:23] them
[56:26] we had seven of
[56:30] them it was
[56:34] mol when he invaded Ethiopia you know
[56:39] about that was the first one the second
[56:42] one is ADF
[56:45] Hitler now these are prophetic
[56:52] Visions the prophet saw them
[56:57] that it will be like this
[56:59] and before they happen
[57:02] those
[57:03] [Music]
[57:04] so
[57:08] in are taking
[57:12] Ethiopia then you saw ADF
[57:17] Hitler on the second world war you know
[57:21] that then he spoke about the fascism
[57:27] nism and
[57:33] communism so the first one was
[57:37] fascism the second one was
[57:41] Nazism and the third one is
[57:44] communism that's why we had
[57:47] fascist we had
[57:51] communist I mean I mean I mean and the
[57:54] naist
[57:58] so that that is the third
[58:00] one the fourth one was science you know
[58:02] about
[58:05] it
[58:10] science now we spoke about uh the cars
[58:16] that that science will
[58:23] improve in such a way that
[58:27] they will build
[58:30] cars that you don't have to drive
[58:35] it you just give it an
[58:39] information I understand there is such
[58:45] car there is a car of which when you go
[58:49] to the
[58:50] mall you don't look for a
[58:54] parking you just get out and tell that
[58:58] car to look for
[59:00] parking and then you go
[59:03] in then it will go and look for a
[59:07] par it is there there somebody that has
[59:11] got that car here in
[59:12] this the church I just don't want to
[59:14] call his
[59:21] name right the prophet saw
[59:24] that yeah as
[59:29] before and then his the fifth one is the
[59:34] moral
[59:35] [Music]
[59:39] Decay then said the olden
[59:44] days the way uh women
[59:51] dressed it was a shame
[59:56] to see just a p
[1:00:02] cot a
[1:00:06] garment just by
[1:00:10] mistake that woman can cry the whole
[1:00:15] week so in the olden days they they
[1:00:19] dressed in a in in a very nice
[1:00:24] way now the prophet saw it before the
[1:00:29] Min skate
[1:00:33] came and the jeans came
[1:00:37] yes now if you dress in a proper
[1:00:43] way you become the most stupid
[1:00:49] woman that you you you are behind
[1:00:54] time the remember
[1:00:57] that that was the fifth
[1:01:00] one the sixth one was a powerful
[1:01:05] woman he says there will be a
[1:01:09] woman a woman
[1:01:12] one that will be so
[1:01:15] powerful and it will be voted by
[1:01:21] women so he said it could either be a
[1:01:24] church
[1:01:27] because a woman types A
[1:01:32] church
[1:01:34] or a a woman rising in great power in
[1:01:42] America due to a popular vote by by
[1:01:50] women some are guessing whether this
[1:01:55] vice president is it not the
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:02] one when I Was preparing this
[1:02:05] message busy checking who voted for this
[1:02:10] woman I find that is women
[1:02:13] that you know what who I'm
[1:02:17] talking very
[1:02:19] powerful now he's taking Trump left and
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:29] right now the last
[1:02:31] one is the destruction of
[1:02:35] America now where are we
[1:02:38] now we are on the sixth one because the
[1:02:42] destruction of
[1:02:44] America W happen
[1:02:47] during won happen during our
[1:02:51] time because it had to do with missiles
[1:02:57] and then once Russia can throw a
[1:03:05] misile that's the end of the
[1:03:08] world because they say that missile is
[1:03:12] like a
[1:03:15] rocket when it
[1:03:18] explode and then it explodes into
[1:03:22] different missiles
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] and those missiles they exploit
[1:03:29] also that's explo
[1:03:32] also and then we have uh
[1:03:37] gases gas yeah on on on this planet
[1:03:40] Earth
[1:03:42] planet so those gases will also
[1:03:47] explode we have
[1:03:50] fuels we've got
[1:03:54] pipes where we've got oils and things
[1:03:57] like
[1:03:58] that so the whole the whole planet will
[1:04:03] explode that's why it says now it will
[1:04:06] shake the
[1:04:08] Earth back to its
[1:04:11] position because the Earth is in an
[1:04:16] angle because during the time of
[1:04:20] Noah H there was a lot of
[1:04:23] water and then it cost even the tilting
[1:04:26] of
[1:04:29] the how
[1:04:31] am so
[1:04:33] then which means that the up to one to
[1:04:37] moral you know the women now you know
[1:04:40] it's it's only
[1:04:43] you when we talk about women we are
[1:04:46] talking about
[1:04:47] you the sisters
[1:04:50] here
[1:04:52] otherwise I always I told you
[1:04:56] when I go to any mall I just check
[1:05:00] whether I will meet a
[1:05:04] sister just a woman that dressed in in a
[1:05:08] in a right
[1:05:12] way I'll will get one or
[1:05:15] two but they will not be that
[1:05:20] perfect according to the we but they'll
[1:05:23] be better
[1:05:27] okay fine so now let's know where we
[1:05:32] are we now it's a time for that powerful
[1:05:37] woman because the six
[1:05:40] Vision says there will there will arose
[1:05:43] up in America a most beautiful but cruel
[1:05:52] woman she held the people in her
[1:05:55] complete complete
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:57] power that's it amen so now we are we we
[1:06:02] are uh we are going we are almost we are
[1:06:06] almost
[1:06:09] there but now what what is going on
[1:06:13] now is
[1:06:16] you where is your
[1:06:19] position remember we are waiting for the
[1:06:22] coming of the Lord
[1:06:25] that has to do with the changing of our
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:29] body now what's going to change your
[1:06:33] body we're waiting for the the
[1:06:38] groom we are the
[1:06:40] bride and the groom is coming to fetch
[1:06:46] us so Jesus came three
[1:06:51] times three times he first came
[1:06:56] to redeem his
[1:06:58] church then he came the second
[1:07:01] time to receive the church he he will
[1:07:05] come and receive the
[1:07:08] church we are
[1:07:10] waiting for him to come and receive
[1:07:15] us then he'll come for the third
[1:07:18] time with his
[1:07:23] church and the other thing
[1:07:26] we have to know his
[1:07:30] throne his first Throne was in
[1:07:34] heaven that was in judgment
[1:07:37] seat then his second Throne was in
[1:07:42] Christ now the the third
[1:07:45] room is in the
[1:07:48] bride amen that you should know amen you
[1:07:52] should
[1:07:54] know that the that
[1:07:57] Throne is in your
[1:08:01] heart whenever you do a wrong
[1:08:05] thing you must know that now he's not in
[1:08:09] the
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:12] throne
[1:08:14] because if God is in his
[1:08:18] throne then god is
[1:08:22] perfect then he expect perfection
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:28] when you are
[1:08:30] angry just know that God is not
[1:08:34] angry
[1:08:36] you and when you are
[1:08:40] lying must know God is not in
[1:08:44] you because he supposed to be his
[1:08:48] throne supposed to be
[1:08:54] God supposed to be a potential
[1:09:01] God you don't control
[1:09:04] yourself the the god that is in
[1:09:07] you is doing his
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:13] thing are we
[1:09:16] together so now uh the
[1:09:21] bride let me just uh introduce nicely
[1:09:25] this
[1:09:27] thing what is
[1:09:32] marriage now or what is the
[1:09:35] stage of being
[1:09:40] married in our
[1:09:42] case is the
[1:09:44] bright and the
[1:09:46] we not only the weight they revealed
[1:09:51] it can I repeat myself
[1:09:55] our
[1:09:56] case I will tell you why are you called
[1:09:59] The Bride but not the
[1:10:06] church the the the prophet says when we
[1:10:10] meet
[1:10:11] here we are not in an
[1:10:15] arena
[1:10:17] no no we said no the church is not an
[1:10:22] arena it's it's a it's a meeting place
[1:10:26] of
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:30] Believers it's a mystical Body of
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] Christ right now the the most
[1:10:42] Saints and
[1:10:46] Maas they when they worship
[1:10:50] God they worshiped him in different
[1:10:53] dispensations
[1:10:59] now each and every one of
[1:11:02] us has got a strong
[1:11:08] Zeal to meet
[1:11:10] God you know
[1:11:13] Moses saw a burning
[1:11:17] bush Bible says so and say God spoke out
[1:11:22] of that burning
[1:11:26] and the angel of the Lord spoke also
[1:11:32] out so
[1:11:34] Moses was communing with
[1:11:38] God like we are communing with
[1:11:42] God whenever we
[1:11:45] meet communication
[1:11:48] with and whenever we
[1:11:51] pray we communicate with our father
[1:11:57] but we have that
[1:12:00] Zeal that we want to meet him
[1:12:05] one now Moses had that
[1:12:09] Zeal I want to meet him but he was with
[1:12:12] him day in and day
[1:12:15] out speaking with God day in
[1:12:19] and but he wanted to meet
[1:12:22] him until he said I want to meet
[1:12:26] now we was talking to him he says I want
[1:12:29] to see
[1:12:30] you you see amen it's like maybe a young
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:37] man who want to get
[1:12:41] married he will always dream about what
[1:12:45] type of woman am I going to
[1:12:50] have or meditate about the type of
[1:12:57] now we meditate about our
[1:13:03] God I was I was I was speaking to the
[1:13:08] pastor the Pastor
[1:13:11] said I saw New
[1:13:16] Jerusalem
[1:13:18] amen then I said
[1:13:21] pastor that thing you have to tell me
[1:13:23] but don't tell other people
[1:13:27] they won't believe
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:30] you because if you can go to heaven
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:35] now and come
[1:13:38] back and tell people that you were in
[1:13:42] heaven they're going to give you a
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:48] displine I said to the
[1:13:50] pastor
[1:13:53] God cannot make you
[1:13:57] preach about a
[1:13:59] place and don't show you that
[1:14:06] place
[1:14:08] so
[1:14:11] Paul preached about the different
[1:14:18] bodies celestial bodies
[1:14:22] C and glorified bodies
[1:14:27] God took him to Third
[1:14:31] Heaven he saw what he was
[1:14:35] preaching when he came
[1:14:38] back he was you know he cross
[1:14:43] Dimensions he said I know a
[1:14:46] man in that
[1:14:49] heaven I don't know whether I was in
[1:14:51] this
[1:14:52] body or out of this body
[1:14:55] but I saw
[1:14:57] that and then where is that
[1:15:03] heaven see now brother bam
[1:15:08] brother
[1:15:10] preached about different
[1:15:14] dimensions and then God made it a
[1:15:18] point that he visits that
[1:15:22] place now now what happens is this
[1:15:27] you cannot visit New
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:31] Jerusalem in this
[1:15:34] body and then you can never visit New
[1:15:40] Jerusalem uh without you being that
[1:15:47] Jerusalem because you you must be
[1:15:51] it then that is the visitation
[1:15:55] and then when you
[1:15:57] are telling
[1:16:01] somebody you must take
[1:16:04] him and he must be that
[1:16:07] Jerusalem and the two of
[1:16:09] you we meeting that Dimension
[1:16:14] now and then when you are through you
[1:16:17] come back
[1:16:18] here and come and and talk to
[1:16:22] us that is why John
[1:16:25] saw
[1:16:26] it and he was with somebody
[1:16:30] else and then he wanted to
[1:16:35] kneel and that man said no I'm one of
[1:16:40] you I'm not
[1:16:42] God because he knew nobody can go there
[1:16:47] unless he's
[1:16:51] God that is why the prophet says we are
[1:16:57] potentially you
[1:16:59] see the revealed word makes you a
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:08] potential so there are
[1:17:11] events that will make
[1:17:13] you to cross
[1:17:18] over you cross
[1:17:21] over so remember that now we have what
[1:17:25] we call
[1:17:29] dispensations you must always
[1:17:32] know in which dispensation are you right
[1:17:37] now then in that
[1:17:41] dispensation
[1:17:43] then there is a
[1:17:45] Ministry you should know your
[1:17:50] dispensation and the
[1:17:53] ministry because
[1:17:55] if you miss the right
[1:17:59] dispensation you'll have a wrong
[1:18:04] minist and if you got the wrong
[1:18:08] Ministry then your faith will be
[1:18:13] diverted your anointing will be the
[1:18:15] first one I the false
[1:18:19] one because you are in a wrong
[1:18:23] place amen
[1:18:25] are we together I always give you this
[1:18:29] example about
[1:18:31] Moses that now
[1:18:35] Moses uh he was taking the children of
[1:18:41] Israel to the promised
[1:18:44] land he never was in the promised
[1:18:47] land it's Abraham that knows the
[1:18:52] promis but now God cannot say take
[1:18:56] them without showing you
[1:19:00] that that is why I said to
[1:19:03] Moses come and stand here look that's
[1:19:08] the place you
[1:19:09] see and Moses saw
[1:19:11] it then God said you won't enter into
[1:19:15] but Moses saw
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:18] it you see now God cannot promise you
[1:19:25] eternal life without showing you that
[1:19:29] eternal
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:34] life that's where now we speak about the
[1:19:39] Revelation you know the prophet
[1:19:42] says when you
[1:19:44] dream and then when that dream is
[1:19:50] interpreted then it becomes uh it's no
[1:19:54] more a dream
[1:19:56] now because it has been
[1:20:02] interpreted uh it becomes now a
[1:20:08] vision once your
[1:20:11] dream has been
[1:20:14] interpreted then it's no more dream it's
[1:20:17] a vision you seen
[1:20:20] something then
[1:20:22] interpretation brings that something
[1:20:25] then it's a vision
[1:20:27] now that is why when you have a
[1:20:30] dream wait for the
[1:20:35] interpretation
[1:20:37] okay now the Bible
[1:20:40] says the
[1:20:42] spirit and the
[1:20:45] bride say
[1:20:49] come what is the
[1:20:51] bride what is the difference between the
[1:20:54] the spirit and the
[1:20:58] bride okay the
[1:21:02] bride okay we you know the Bible speak
[1:21:06] speaks
[1:21:08] about the Son of
[1:21:13] God
[1:21:15] and
[1:21:16] uh no it speaks about
[1:21:19] the the Son of
[1:21:22] God and then it speaks
[1:21:25] again about the son of
[1:21:28] man are we together the Son of God and
[1:21:32] the son of man when we are
[1:21:36] born we are
[1:21:38] born in the
[1:21:40] we as a Son of
[1:21:44] God now when Jesus
[1:21:48] Christ came to the
[1:21:52] Gentiles he came as the son of of
[1:21:57] God I'm talking about the the
[1:22:01] Gentiles to the Jews he came as a son of
[1:22:05] man he was coming to
[1:22:09] cap the Pyramid of the
[1:22:13] Jews he came as the son of
[1:22:16] man son of man is God in a
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] man God himself coming as a man
[1:22:27] now he came to the
[1:22:28] Jews and they rejected
[1:22:31] him and then he came to
[1:22:34] us as the Holy
[1:22:37] Spirit the Son of
[1:22:40] God now we are going to where we
[1:22:43] are the Son of God the son the Holy

[1:24:41] heart of as the
[1:24:44] children to our
[1:24:48] fathers

[1:27:55] that you should know that you are
[1:27:58] married just read that scripture I
[1:28:01] said 2 Corinthians chap
[1:28:04] 11 11 verse 2 verse 2 for I am jealous
[1:28:10] over you with Godly jealous that's
[1:28:13] Paul he what he says he says I am
[1:28:16] jealous over
[1:28:20] you but with Godly jealous Godly jealous
[1:28:25] continue my my brother for I have
[1:28:27] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:28:31] present you as a chased virgin to Christ
[1:28:34] now here he says he says now I am I have
[1:28:38] espoused
[1:28:41] you so you are you have been
[1:28:47] espoused to one
[1:28:50] husband so that I must present you as a
[1:28:53] chest Chas uh a chased virgin to
[1:29:02] Christ now a chased
[1:29:07] virgin it means then it's it's
[1:29:12] undefiled and now the Bible
[1:29:16] continues why it says where he says I
[1:29:19] will receive you that's
[1:29:24] unto
[1:29:27] myself Paul says I have espoused
[1:29:32] you are we
[1:29:35] together now the Bible continues and
[1:29:40] says I will receive you unto
[1:29:46] myself right
[1:29:49] amen that's what the Bible say
[1:29:54] now verse chapter 19 chapter 19
[1:29:59] uh if you read verse
[1:30:03] 7 Revelation sorry
[1:30:08] 19 S verse seven we can we can read that
[1:30:12] one now we we we we we we we are we have
[1:30:18] United with our husband
[1:30:24] it's just to make you
[1:30:26] aware otherwise
[1:30:29] if you don't have
[1:30:32] that then uh you miss the rapturing
[1:30:40] Fai because you're waiting for the
[1:30:44] Rapture what is the
[1:30:47] rapture the Rapture is the quickening
[1:30:50] power
[1:30:54] quickening
[1:30:56] power is the changing of the
[1:31:00] body now you don't leave the body
[1:31:03] here and be taken by a
[1:31:06] RT and look at your body and say there's
[1:31:09] my
[1:31:10] body no your body is
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:15] quickened the Bible
[1:31:17] says the second
[1:31:21] Adam is a quickening spirit
[1:31:26] your body must
[1:31:28] change now what will make your body
[1:31:32] change if you don't
[1:31:35] know that now your body needs to
[1:31:40] change then you don't
[1:31:42] have the rapturing
[1:31:46] faith because the rapturing
[1:31:49] faith the Bible says with the same
[1:31:52] spirit
[1:31:54] that he rose Jesus from the
[1:31:57] dead he was going to do
[1:32:00] that so now you must
[1:32:02] have that same
[1:32:05] spirit that same
[1:32:08] power that can Quicken
[1:32:13] you our Lord Jesus
[1:32:16] Christ when he
[1:32:19] resurrected there was nothing in the
[1:32:21] Tomb there was nothing in the Tomb
[1:32:28] brother bam speaks
[1:32:31] about the first
[1:32:34] resurrection now the first resurrection
[1:32:39] says uh when
[1:32:42] you
[1:32:45] receive the word of
[1:32:48] God then he shows about he speaks about
[1:32:52] the the 10 visions
[1:32:56] five were
[1:32:58] wise five were foolish but they were
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:05] visions and they were
[1:33:08] waiting and they all
[1:33:15] slept the the the
[1:33:18] foolish slept with their
[1:33:21] foolishness the wise slept with the
[1:33:28] wisdom right but when the word
[1:33:32] came the wise
[1:33:35] Vision light out their
[1:33:38] LS that is called the first
[1:33:42] resurrection they resurrected to the
[1:33:46] eternal
[1:33:49] life they cross over they don't go to
[1:33:51] any judgment
[1:33:56] they
[1:33:57] resurrected but now the second
[1:34:01] Resurrection will be in the
[1:34:05] Judgment the foolish
[1:34:08] virgin are going to the
[1:34:11] Judgment then they will
[1:34:13] Resurrect The
[1:34:17] judgment are we
[1:34:19] together
[1:34:21] so now
[1:34:25] with with with with the first
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:30] resurrection it's
[1:34:33] ET so now the
[1:34:35] bride has got the first
[1:34:39] resurrection the bride will never go to
[1:34:42] any
[1:34:43] judgment he has resurrected to
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:49] Eternity and the bride must know that
[1:34:54] that he's got the first
[1:34:58] resurrection that is why at at
[1:35:01] times we should not be disturbed by the
[1:35:05] worldly
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] things they are there you've got the
[1:35:12] power to overcome
[1:35:16] them
[1:35:19] right
[1:35:21] now it says revelation
[1:35:26] 197 uh it says let us be glad and
[1:35:30] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:35:34] marriage of the Lamb is
[1:35:36] come and his wife has made herself
[1:35:42] ready now the the the the
[1:35:48] Readiness of uniting the two it's it's
[1:35:52] when the two
[1:35:57] United
[1:35:59] together because you must be a witness
[1:36:03] to
[1:36:05] that you know our Lord Jesus Christ when
[1:36:08] he was
[1:36:10] here while we are opening the book of
[1:36:14] Romans I mean John 8 John
[1:36:20] 8:18 last time I told you that now
[1:36:25] you must be witness of
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:31] yourself you must be the witness of
[1:36:38] yourself now Verse 18 read it my
[1:36:43] brother I am one that bear witness of
[1:36:46] myself and the father that sent me
[1:36:49] beareth witness of me now what happens
[1:36:52] is
[1:36:55] God as I've said cannot make you a
[1:37:00] bright and while you
[1:37:04] yourself you are not witness of
[1:37:09] yourself look if you are
[1:37:14] sick and then you come to brother
[1:37:19] here to pray for
[1:37:22] you and you without
[1:37:26] him he will never be
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:32] healed because you must be witness of
[1:37:37] yourself that this man will pray for me
[1:37:42] and I'm going to be
[1:37:45] healed you see you are the he he is not
[1:37:48] a
[1:37:50] Healer no he's just executing the duty
[1:37:55] the
[1:37:57] gift but but the person that must
[1:38:01] receive the
[1:38:03] healing he must receive it before he's
[1:38:06] prayed
[1:38:10] for he must know that I'm in a right
[1:38:14] man I'm before the man of
[1:38:17] God then he will lay hands upon me I'm
[1:38:20] going to get
[1:38:22] healed that is why
[1:38:25] they rushed to
[1:38:28] Jesus some will touch the H of the
[1:38:32] government knowing that if this man can
[1:38:36] just ATT a
[1:38:37] away I'm going to be
[1:38:41] healed are we together so
[1:38:45] now they said to to to our Lord Jesus
[1:38:48] Christ you keep on
[1:38:51] saying the son of God God at times you
[1:38:55] are God you don't even have witness of
[1:38:58] the you yourself you don't have
[1:39:02] witness he said no I bear witness of
[1:39:09] myself now that was not the man Jesus
[1:39:14] speaking no it was not man Jesus it was
[1:39:17] God
[1:39:19] himself he says I bear witness of my
[1:39:23] who can be the witness of
[1:39:27] God because when he
[1:39:29] saw about
[1:39:33] himself he's the witness of
[1:39:36] himself now they say to God you don't
[1:39:40] have a
[1:39:42] witness he can easily
[1:39:45] say where were you when I created heaven
[1:39:51] and because I was by
[1:39:54] myself my witness was my
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:39:59] mind and in my
[1:40:01] mind was a
[1:40:03] bride because it processed from my
[1:40:08] mind but he said I'm I'm a witness of
[1:40:15] myself now brother Bren in this uh
[1:40:19] spoken
[1:40:21] with Revelation chter 4
[1:40:24] part one in in in in in paragraph
[1:40:28] 8787 says so there's going to be a
[1:40:31] meeting in the
[1:40:35] air that is
[1:40:37] eruption says one of these
[1:40:40] days but there cannot be a
[1:40:44] meeting without a
[1:40:48] marriage amen are we together
[1:40:52] amen and then he keeps on say he says NE
[1:40:56] PGE your heart from all evil
[1:41:03] thinking and then he says have faith in
[1:41:07] God no matter how dark it
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:15] looks and how many laughes and makes fun
[1:41:18] and says you made a mistake
[1:41:26] says keep right on living a holy and
[1:41:30] living for
[1:41:35] God he
[1:41:37] says just keep moving on the hour will
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:47] arrive let me read a very long uh uh
[1:41:50] quote here
[1:41:54] he says
[1:41:55] now in this uh book
[1:41:58] here proving his weight proving his word
[1:42:02] I'll start from paragraph 236 here
[1:42:05] paragraph 236 now remember that was not
[1:42:09] Jesus talking to
[1:42:14] Abraham
[1:42:15] no that could desend the
[1:42:19] thoughts in Sarah's mind
[1:42:24] behind him that was not
[1:42:28] Jesus he had not he had not yet been
[1:42:35] born but it was a man in human
[1:42:41] flesh don't miss that now during
[1:42:45] Abraham's time it was a man in human
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:53] right amen remember the Bible says so
[1:42:56] shall it
[1:42:59] be the days of
[1:43:03] Sodom there will be
[1:43:05] God in human
[1:43:07] flesh we will come to
[1:43:10] that but it was a man in human
[1:43:15] flesh of which Abraham called
[1:43:20] Elohim and it was the days of s
[1:43:26] now he says now watch
[1:43:33] clo uh and Jesus
[1:43:36] said as it was in the days of
[1:43:42] sod so will it be at the coming of the
[1:43:46] son of
[1:43:50] man I said
[1:43:53] there is a Son of
[1:43:55] God and there's a son of
[1:43:59] man the Son of God is the seven Church
[1:44:05] ages when you cross over to the
[1:44:09] seals then is a son of
[1:44:12] man now is the time that you are living
[1:44:15] in the time of the son of
[1:44:19] men so will it be at the coming of the
[1:44:23] son
[1:44:25] of right
[1:44:27] amen now
[1:44:29] remember that the coming of the
[1:44:33] Lord is a
[1:44:37] process there are those that slept
[1:44:39] during the first church
[1:44:42] Age The Bride during Paul's
[1:44:46] time and during IR
[1:44:49] time during Martin's time
[1:44:53] Luther Wesley and even in our time there
[1:44:57] were those that slept
[1:45:01] before you see but now the
[1:45:06] Capstone is the son of
[1:45:09] man we will go to
[1:45:12] that when the son of man is being
[1:45:19] revealed right then not no more as a
[1:45:28] church
[1:45:30] no then he says he says see not noral
[1:45:34] you know
[1:45:37] English
[1:45:40] yeah uh not no more the bride is called
[1:45:44] see it says now it's no more a
[1:45:48] church it becomes now the
[1:45:50] bride when the son of man is
[1:45:55] is revealed to
[1:45:58] them right not the
[1:46:02] church church is
[1:46:06] ages that's why it says Church ages is
[1:46:10] time but once you cross cross
[1:46:14] over it's another
[1:46:17] dispensation I said we should
[1:46:20] know the different dispensation
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] once the dispensation
[1:46:27] changes the ministry
[1:46:31] changes the Revelation
[1:46:34] changes the faith
[1:46:38] changes the inspiration
[1:46:40] changes it's another
[1:46:44] dispensation of not of the

[1:52:25] call and he will come right through
[1:52:29] this what we have said the
[1:52:33] marriage we come to this when the son of
[1:52:36] man will come
[1:52:38] down and come in human
[1:52:42] flesh to unite the two together I'm not
[1:52:46] talking about when he coming to rapture
[1:52:52] no when it
[1:52:53] comes to
[1:52:56] unite the two
[1:53:00] together the angel of the Lord or the
[1:53:03] seven
[1:53:05] angels
[1:53:07] descended what
[1:53:09] for they came and pick him
[1:53:14] up and after picking him up what
[1:53:18] happened came from the West going
[1:53:21] Eastward
[1:53:24] what
[1:53:25] for to open up the SE to R to reveal the
[1:53:30] SE then that
[1:53:32] changes that's a new new
[1:53:35] ministry it it changes that's a new
[1:53:39] commission that's another
[1:53:43] dispensation I would like to repeat
[1:53:48] myself when I read

[1:53:55] down and come in human
[1:54:00] flesh to to unite the two
[1:54:04] together he comes in human
[1:54:09] flesh to unite the two
[1:54:14] together right amen and then once you
[1:54:17] unite the two
[1:54:19] together then it makes you a potential
[1:54:22] go
[1:54:24] who
[1:54:25] came in human
[1:54:27] flesh having a
[1:54:30] book that carries our
[1:54:34] name look the Bible
[1:54:38] says he that
[1:54:41] overcometh I'll give him to
[1:54:46] eat the hidden man
[1:54:52] there's a man that was
[1:54:56] hidden it will only be given I'll read
[1:54:59] you the code the prophet says it's for
[1:55:03] specific
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:08] people you see if you don't have a white
[1:55:13] stone you won't you won't know your
[1:55:16] name because he says I will give him
[1:55:18] even a white
[1:55:20] stone and his name will be written
[1:55:23] there and he will know his
[1:55:29] [Applause]
[1:55:30] name so you will know your your new
[1:55:35] name because it's written in the Lamb's
[1:55:40] Book of
[1:55:45] Life the church has to be the
[1:55:49] weight he is the weight and the two
[1:55:52] unites
[1:55:54] together right and to do that it it
[1:55:57] takes the
[1:56:00] manifestation of the reveal of the
[1:56:02] revelation of the son
[1:56:05] of are we
[1:56:08] together Jesus Christ will come down in
[1:56:12] human flesh among
[1:56:16] us to unite us he says he will

[1:56:33] where is it okay fine it's not here yeah
[1:56:37] that
[1:56:38] one now when it says he will come down

[1:56:50] Rapture in rapture ing us we going to
[1:56:54] change our body going to meet him here
[1:56:58] he's not coming here
[1:57:01] no we're going to change and meet

[1:57:12] be the
[1:57:14] we because

[2:00:49] must be soldiers
[2:00:53] not just fresh
[2:00:57] recruits you are aged soldiers
[2:01:06] now and been trained to
[2:01:11] fight and the Satan will come among
[2:01:16] you cause you to dispute with one
[2:01:19] another
[2:01:22] turn him
[2:01:24] down just
[2:01:27] immediately
[2:01:30] immediately you are
[2:01:32] Brethren and he's the
[2:01:35] enemy and we are
[2:01:37] here to hold the
[2:01:42] standard
[2:01:45] the when the world is
[2:01:48] dark we are the light
[2:01:54] all
[2:01:55] together when you
[2:01:57] fight don't use the wrong
[2:02:02] weapon right now they use
[2:02:05] missiles and
[2:02:07] Rocket there no time for Bo o
[2:02:16] room no they're using rocket
[2:02:23] don't fight with a wrong
[2:02:28] weapon and your
[2:02:31] weapon you must hold it with your right
[2:02:36] hand and you must swing it to the right
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:42] direction otherwise it will never find a
[2:02:47] Target and it will never destroy your
[2:02:49] enemy
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:52] when you have your
[2:02:54] weapon you must know that you have the
[2:02:56] right
[2:02:58] weapon and when you direct it it must
[2:03:02] reach the right
[2:03:06] place uh I understand I don't know I've
[2:03:10] never joined an
[2:03:14] army but the the the the the the
[2:03:19] basic strategy in the army
[2:03:25] the first they they teach you to
[2:03:29] unite must be one thing and you must be
[2:03:33] orderly and you must be
[2:03:37] disciplined you must unite be one thing
[2:03:41] when you're going to the Army you're
[2:03:43] going to fight you must not be
[2:03:47] enemies and you must have
[2:03:50] order and you must be
[2:03:58] disciplined uh years
[2:04:00] back I saw
[2:04:03] a a battle between America and
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:09] Japan and then Japanese are very
[2:04:16] short then they will take uh the
[2:04:19] branches
[2:04:22] and even
[2:04:23] stems and hide with them as
[2:04:26] though lot of you think it's a
[2:04:30] bush it's human beings and then they
[2:04:33] will move a little
[2:04:35] bit and then one
[2:04:38] soldier saw that these trees are
[2:04:43] moving then he went to the send say such
[2:04:48] the trees are
[2:04:50] moving then the s said I know now he was
[2:04:55] shivering he he wanted to
[2:04:58] shoot but the
[2:05:00] sergeant and the cap knew that they
[2:05:04] won't reach the
[2:05:06] target he want them to come
[2:05:09] closer and this one is
[2:05:12] J and in the
[2:05:14] Army you don't shoot until they tell you
[2:05:17] to
[2:05:20] shoot so the captain of the
[2:05:24] ship when he's in the
[2:05:26] ship he's not disturbed by The Roaring
[2:05:31] waves he's got an
[2:05:33] experience he is the captain of
[2:05:36] that he knows that it will never
[2:05:39] sing he's been traveling in that sea for
[2:05:43] years he's been trained on
[2:05:46] that you'll never be disturbed by that
[2:05:50] or the velocity of the
[2:05:54] and he knows that his
[2:05:58] crew has been
[2:06:01] trained now that's a season
[2:06:05] Soldier he knows when to
[2:06:08] shoot doesn't waste his
[2:06:12] bullet shooting in the
[2:06:14] air no he shoot for the
[2:06:20] Target now his first
[2:06:23] enemy is
[2:06:27] fear as a
[2:06:29] soldier your first
[2:06:32] enemy should be
[2:06:36] fear now what causes fear that is why
[2:06:40] Jesus Christ says fear
[2:06:44] not that's why the angel of the Lord
[2:06:46] when he
[2:06:47] comes Daniel throws himself down
[2:06:51] says fear
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:55] not when the
[2:06:57] prophet was in the
[2:06:59] cave reading and
[2:07:01] praying he saw a light the logos coming
[2:07:06] and then it dropped yet it became a man
[2:07:10] he said fear
[2:07:11] not the first
[2:07:13] thing fear
[2:07:17] not a
[2:07:19] captain hates a fearful Soldier
[2:07:25] you know that in the Army you can be
[2:07:27] caught
[2:07:31] Marsh because because of
[2:07:35] fear they armed you with Necessary
[2:07:38] Things
[2:07:40] weapons they gave you
[2:07:42] generals they studied that
[2:07:46] war and everything you've got everything
[2:07:49] you have your country
[2:07:52] behind you you have everything
[2:07:55] there so when you go there you go there
[2:07:58] knowing that I am representing my
[2:08:02] country now when you are a bride you
[2:08:06] know that now you got a better place
[2:08:08] than this
[2:08:11] one it's an eternal
[2:08:14] one don't fear and fear
[2:08:18] not that is why he said tell no
[2:08:22] one because that thing is
[2:08:25] yours it should be revealed in
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:32] you so
[2:08:34] now
[2:08:36] we as a chest
[2:08:42] virsion uh the
[2:08:45] word unite
[2:08:48] us with our groom
[2:08:55] when the word here unites with a
[2:09:02] person the we combines with a
[2:09:07] person and the two become
[2:09:11] one when the we combine with a
[2:09:15] person who is a
[2:09:19] person a person
[2:09:22] is when the word germinates into your
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:27] heart and then when it germinates into
[2:09:30] your
[2:09:31] heart it brings your self which is your
[2:09:38] theop when it comes to
[2:09:41] Perfection it becomes your
[2:09:43] theop when the we
[2:09:46] here
[2:09:48] unites with the person that
[2:09:52] person is your
[2:09:54] soul you see the soul is the nature of
[2:09:59] your
[2:10:03] spirit when you are
[2:10:07] born
[2:10:08] naturally we are born in your
[2:10:13] nationality but when you are
[2:10:16] born
[2:10:18] spiritually H you receive
[2:10:21] divine
[2:10:22] nature your nature
[2:10:26] changes then it becomes a divine
[2:10:29] nature and then now when you
[2:10:34] are a
[2:10:37] perfect person then we say you are
[2:10:41] Divine when the
[2:10:45] word when the word has
[2:10:48] created a being in you
[2:10:54] that being is
[2:10:55] called
[2:10:58] yourself you see amen okay let

[2:18:37] commission is is is when now the word is
[2:18:43] revealed unto you he came with a
[2:18:47] book and then that book had your name
[2:18:51] now in if the name is in the L book of
[2:18:55] life there are some
[2:18:59] things that now uh you know in the book
[2:19:03] of Philip we come back chter 4:9
[2:19:07] 4:9 I want you to see this now it says
[2:19:11] that you have the material on earth now

[2:19:26] Harmony Philippians 4:9 Philippians 4:9
[2:19:31] those things which he have both learned
[2:19:34] and received and heard and seen in me do
[2:19:39] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[2:19:41] amen now it says now those things which
[2:19:44] you have
[2:19:48] leared have leared
[2:19:52] and what after you learn what do you do
[2:19:55] reive you
[2:19:57] receive because you have
[2:20:00] heard and
[2:20:02] seen you have
[2:20:05] heard you have seen you have
[2:20:08] learned you have
[2:20:11] received
[2:20:13] right right remember that the Throne of
[2:20:17] God is in the heart of men
[2:20:22] and the greatest
[2:20:24] battle is in the
[2:20:28] mind now what was in the mind of
[2:20:32] Abraham when he
[2:20:34] met what was Abraham
[2:20:38] thinking when he was
[2:20:42] communing with with with with with
[2:20:45] M or what was in the mind of brother
[2:20:51] because the Bible says we should have
[2:20:53] the mind
[2:20:55] of
[2:20:57] Christ mind of Christ amen now brother
[2:21:00] Brenham brother Bram when he calls the
[2:21:04] squirrels into
[2:21:08] existence what was in his
[2:21:10] mind because you know he said he said I
[2:21:14] didn't hear any
[2:21:16] voice no he didn't hear any
[2:21:19] voice no
[2:21:21] but he just
[2:21:22] decided and call those
[2:21:26] squ and then it was said to him God said
[2:21:30] that is your third fool you
[2:21:33] created squirrels into
[2:21:38] existence and what was in the mind of
[2:21:41] sister
[2:21:43] Ed when he said nothing but the truth
[2:21:47] brother
[2:21:50] right amen and what was in the mind of
[2:21:55] Paul when he speaks about the the the
[2:21:58] Battle of two
[2:22:02] Natures he says now I'm a human being
[2:22:05] I've got two natures and those Natures
[2:22:08] are are
[2:22:12] fighting so
[2:22:15] now these things they start from your
[2:22:19] heart and go to your
[2:22:21] spirit and go to your
[2:22:25] mind now if there's no word in your
[2:22:33] heart then there's nothing in your
[2:22:37] spirit then there's zero in your
[2:22:42] mind your
[2:22:46] thinking will always be zero
[2:22:50] in terms of the word of
[2:22:52] God your
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:56] reasoning will always be
[2:22:59] zero now what what what makes
[2:23:03] men to see
[2:23:06] visions that is
[2:23:08] because his everyday
[2:23:11] life is a
[2:23:14] song it's a scripture it's a
[2:23:18] verse he's thinking
[2:23:22] it's about the word of
[2:23:23] God and when you think about the word of
[2:23:26] God it takes you what you thinking about
[2:23:31] it takes you to that
[2:23:33] [Applause]
[2:23:36] place and when you
[2:23:38] pray you you don't pray a God that you
[2:23:41] don't
[2:23:43] know you pray God that you could see his
[2:23:49] vision you've never seen
[2:23:51] him
[2:23:53] personally but when you speak you speak
[2:23:57] like somebody speaking to his
[2:23:59] father your father is standing here with
[2:24:06] him
[2:24:07] right that's why it no
[2:24:10] man can come to
[2:24:13] me except the
[2:24:16] father then the the the prophet says
[2:24:21] the word
[2:24:23] manifest when the word is
[2:24:26] Manifest you see the
[2:24:29] father when the word you see it
[2:24:34] manifested then you see the
[2:24:36] father let me let me uh uh uh read you
[2:24:42] another quote
[2:24:43] here you can take a wheat and plant it
[2:24:50] in a different kind of
[2:24:54] soil it will never
[2:24:57] grow but what's good to have a certain
[2:25:00] fertilizer in that
[2:25:04] ground to raise
[2:25:07] wheat and there is no fertilizer and and
[2:25:10] if there's no fertilizer on that
[2:25:16] ground the wheat will not germinate
[2:25:23] it will never grow so no matter where
[2:25:26] the word
[2:25:30] Falls it doesn't fall in the right kind
[2:25:32] of
[2:25:35] heart you hear what he
[2:25:37] says it says now if the word of
[2:25:42] God doesn't find the right kind of
[2:25:48] heart it cannot germinate
[2:25:52] you can water
[2:25:55] read day and
[2:25:58] night the sun can
[2:26:00] come it will never pick up the life
[2:26:06] from because it landed in a wrong
[2:26:12] heart but he says yes in paragraph
[2:26:16] 261 unveiling of God it says and when
[2:26:20] you see the word made
[2:26:25] manifest you see the
[2:26:28] Father the
[2:26:31] manifestation of the word brings the
[2:26:36] father okay we uh we we read the
[2:26:42] scripture that says the spirit and the
[2:26:47] blood says come
[2:26:51] amen now the spirit and the bride say
[2:26:57] come Lord
[2:26:59] Jesus how many people do you see
[2:27:03] there one because the Bible
[2:27:07] says God is a
[2:27:10] spirit they that worship
[2:27:13] him they shall worship Him in spirit
[2:27:20] in truth and in
[2:27:22] spirit right now if if the word is a
[2:27:28] spirit I mean
[2:27:30] if God is a
[2:27:33] spirit so now the Bible says is the
[2:27:38] bride and the spirit now that
[2:27:43] spirit is the we in the beginning was
[2:27:46] the we the we was the we was called that
[2:27:50] that is the seat of God you know the
[2:27:52] scripture that I love in what you call
[2:27:55] we don't read it I'll just quote it you
[2:27:57] know it uh 1 John 3:9 it says John 3:9
[2:28:03] John the Son of God does not
[2:28:09] sin because the seed remains in
[2:28:16] him because he's born of
[2:28:19] God
[2:28:21] amen right now it speaks about the seed
[2:28:24] of God
[2:28:27] know that one says whosoever is born of
[2:28:29] God does not commit
[2:28:31] sin yes it's right for his
[2:28:35] seed remain in
[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:39] him now the Bible continues and
[2:28:43] says greater is
[2:28:46] he that is in US
[2:28:50] so which means is the seed that is in
[2:28:54] us now how does now that seed
[2:29:00] germinate in uh The Book of John
[2:29:05] 16 in verse 12 verse 12 it
[2:29:09] says Uh there's quite a lot of things
[2:29:13] that I will teach
[2:29:15] you you won't be able to cross
[2:29:21] right but I will send you a
[2:29:26] comforter and then the comforter will
[2:29:28] take from
[2:29:31] me and bring to
[2:29:33] you you so it says you cannot B them
[2:29:38] now what I'm trying to
[2:29:41] say is to take the
[2:29:44] word the word is
[2:29:47] God and combine it
[2:29:50] with you who is the
[2:29:53] you the you is the soul that
[2:29:56] [Applause]
[2:29:57] is and now when once that
[2:30:01] word finds a place in your soul remember
[2:30:06] you were born in
[2:30:08] sin see now the word must come right
[2:30:13] into your
[2:30:15] heart and then you remember I I always
[2:30:18] called Romans 86 is speaking about your
[2:30:23] spirit and the spirit of
[2:30:29] God that they should be one they combine
[2:30:32] in one now I'm trying to bring the
[2:30:37] weight how does it come into your
[2:30:40] heart and when it is
[2:30:43] your the spirit
[2:30:45] itself be witness with our spirit
[2:30:51] that we are the children of God right so
[2:30:54] the two spirit one with the capital S
[2:30:57] the one with the
[2:31:01] small they come to a place where they
[2:31:03] become
[2:31:04] one and then from there on that spirit
[2:31:09] is watering the
[2:31:12] seed what is the seed the seat is when
[2:31:15] you read the word of
[2:31:18] God but you don't need the natural
[2:31:25] understanding that word brings it Waters
[2:31:29] the
[2:31:32] we and then it forms another
[2:31:37] man a supernatural man in
[2:31:42] you now that's a
[2:31:45] marriage between you and the w
[2:31:51] now when now you are fully
[2:31:58] married and what will make you to be to
[2:32:03] receive the words of marriage what will
[2:32:06] make what will make you to say I
[2:32:12] do what will make you to do that it's
[2:32:16] firstly it's predestination
[2:32:20] now after
[2:32:22] predestination then it's the right
[2:32:27] dispensation now when is the right
[2:32:30] dispensation then it should be the right
[2:32:34] Ministry now
[2:32:36] Ministry plays a very important
[2:32:41] role because it's a
[2:32:44] seed that comes to their
[2:32:46] heart now if
[2:32:50] that
[2:32:52] seed comes to a wrong
[2:32:55] heart it will not
[2:32:58] germinate what what is the
[2:33:00] difference between you and the
[2:33:04] Pentecost Pentecostal they chase the the
[2:33:08] demons they pray demon will
[2:33:12] run but the difference between you and
[2:33:16] them is that after the demon goes away
[2:33:21] the Bible says they come and
[2:33:28] check what are you
[2:33:32] eating see and you find that now you
[2:33:36] don't eat the right
[2:33:40] food then they go and call another
[2:33:46] seven then you've got a problem now with
[2:33:49] that person
[2:33:51] that's why you differ because you you
[2:33:54] chase away a
[2:33:56] demon but you put the
[2:33:59] weight and when the demon comes remember
[2:34:03] that the
[2:34:04] demon he's not afraid of
[2:34:07] you he's afraid of the
[2:34:11] weight now you become the
[2:34:15] we then when you are the word it cannot
[2:34:18] penetrate that
[2:34:23] and you are not fearful
[2:34:25] now you are a season Soldier
[2:34:28] now how are we together now that makes
[2:34:32] you
[2:34:33] now a
[2:34:35] bright now that is the
[2:34:38] ministry of the son of
[2:34:42] man now if you go to
[2:34:45] Romans chapter
[2:34:48] 8 and think is verse 19 ver it's the
[2:34:52] same supportive
[2:34:55] [Music]
[2:34:57] Scriptures it says for the earnest
[2:34:59] expectation of the creatures waited for
[2:35:02] the manifestations of the sons of
[2:35:11] God when the Son of God is
[2:35:16] manifested is when he recognized
[2:35:20] the
[2:35:23] groom and is
[2:35:26] married now when you are married to the
[2:35:29] groom there's no
[2:35:32] demon because it must face your
[2:35:38] husband because now we are married
[2:35:41] now
[2:35:43] now that is the
[2:35:46] manifestation of the
[2:35:48] sons of
[2:35:50] God are we
[2:35:52] together in
[2:35:54] closing there was one
[2:35:57] brother who came to me
[2:36:04] and you are talking about underw brother
[2:36:08] Brenham here speaks about seven
[2:36:15] dimensions uh that is meta the Met
[2:36:21] time time whatever you call
[2:36:23] it science science Fifth Dimension Souls
[2:36:28] under the altar I mean Souls under lost
[2:36:31] souls lost souls and souls under the
[2:36:34] altar the seven
[2:36:37] Dimension now where is
[2:36:41] your uh
[2:36:44] under where do you place it
[2:36:49] then I
[2:36:50] said the prophet
[2:36:53] says there are
[2:36:56] levels in
[2:36:59] heaven and there are
[2:37:01] levels in
[2:37:04] Hell there is a
[2:37:07] level where the devil is there is a
[2:37:18] level there's a a level where
[2:37:21] the his angels
[2:37:26] are there's also a
[2:37:28] level where the demons are and there's a
[2:37:32] level where the lost souls
[2:37:35] [Music]
[2:37:36] are so in
[2:37:39] explaining I said the Bible says the
[2:37:43] devil is bound in
[2:37:46] Chains he says those
[2:37:50] that kept not their first
[2:37:55] estate then they were Bound in
[2:37:59] Chains then I said to
[2:38:02] him
[2:38:04] job I mean when God called his
[2:38:09] children the devil was there the Bible
[2:38:12] says he Bound in
[2:38:15] change and is in darkness how did it go
[2:38:19] how did he go
[2:38:22] to so
[2:38:24] now when we speak about
[2:38:28] levels we speak about a
[2:38:31] demon incarnating a
[2:38:35] person and then
[2:38:38] remember God uses your
[2:38:42] heart the devil uses your
[2:38:46] mind but you must know that now
[2:38:49] God and the devil they want
[2:38:53] you you is not your
[2:38:56] mind you is not only your heart but is
[2:39:00] the soul
[2:39:02] that and the Soul
[2:39:07] travels your soul can
[2:39:11] move your soul can
[2:39:14] [Applause]
[2:39:16] fight look you can
[2:39:21] enclosing we have
[2:39:24] dogs we have
[2:39:26] guns we have B
[2:39:30] proofs we have everything we lock our
[2:39:36] places but how does a witch come
[2:39:42] in why don't you shoot that
[2:39:45] person it's because he's in another Di
[2:39:51] the only
[2:39:52] person that can shoot that one is your
[2:39:56] soul because your your soul does not
[2:40:01] [Applause]
[2:40:02] sleep it's your mind that controls your
[2:40:07] body and then that mind is the one that
[2:40:10] sleeps that is why they come at night
[2:40:13] when you are
[2:40:15] asleep and do whatever they
[2:40:18] do are we together
[2:40:22] now they always want an an an an
[2:40:27] immature
[2:40:31] mind that's why they go for
[2:40:35] children because they are still growing
[2:40:39] not that their souls are
[2:40:40] growing their minds are
[2:40:44] growing are we together so now I said to
[2:40:48] the brother said brother there are
[2:40:51] levels there are things that you can see
[2:40:53] with your
[2:40:54] naked that were you you you you are a
[2:40:58] black
[2:41:00] man when you grow up you knew that I
[2:41:04] mean you know that they were
[2:41:08] witches where do they stay these witches
[2:41:11] how do they CL the broom why don't they
[2:41:17] fall how can you
[2:41:19] what you call a
[2:41:22] monkey and and and and dive with that
[2:41:26] monkey it's it's it's a thing that
[2:41:28] happens to another
[2:41:32] dimension but now they are all in the
[2:41:35] sixth
[2:41:37] Dimension but you are alive
[2:41:41] here you are not dead then they can take
[2:41:45] your
[2:41:47] soul we still alive because what keeps
[2:41:50] your body
[2:41:52] alive is your
[2:41:54] spirit so you'll be alive and then they
[2:41:57] can replace that
[2:42:01] spirit with a
[2:42:04] demon so you are a human being that has
[2:42:07] got a
[2:42:10] demon now that is why they come here in
[2:42:13] the service and even attack
[2:42:17] somebody you w
[2:42:20] you see somebody
[2:42:22] screaming you see somebody taken up
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:27] by you just
[2:42:30] say but it's a being supernatural being
[2:42:34] and come and squeeze him and squeeze
[2:42:39] him how are we together it's it's in
[2:42:42] another
[2:42:43] dimension and in another
[2:42:47] level and comes he comes as your
[2:42:50] grandfather okay let me leave that now
[2:42:54] but now what I want you to
[2:42:57] see is that now the
[2:43:01] power that are in you is the revealed
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:07] weight that is the
[2:43:10] marriage may the Lord bless
