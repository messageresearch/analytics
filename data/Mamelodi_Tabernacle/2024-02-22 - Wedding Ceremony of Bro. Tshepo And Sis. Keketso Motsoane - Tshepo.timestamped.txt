[15:28] I believe that we have everything here
[15:33] firstly I will read a scripture
[15:36] preach
[15:39] but to talk to you
[15:45] about the the occasion here
[15:50] because it is from God
[15:55] that's why we should just be happy
[15:58] and accept the condition that God has
[16:02] put us in
[16:05] then you know
[16:10] who is getting married
[16:12] is that you brother yes yeah I see that
[16:17] you are already in a good mood

[16:33] that we've been hanging in there for a
[16:37] long time
[16:40] but then I'm glad to come and see such a
[16:43] good spirit
[16:48] the song saysit
[16:50] upon the Lord
[16:52] [Music]
[16:53] not wait upon the pastor
[16:56] upon the Lord
[16:59] they shall
[17:02] God bless you I'm going to look at the
[17:04] scripture
[17:06] in our days
[17:09] things like marriage and
[17:13] uh it is something that even the people
[17:16] fear
[17:20] some people fear to marry
[17:24] because they reading the papers
[17:27] about the things that are happening in
[17:30] the marriage
[17:33] amen amen but then if you come to the
[17:35] Lord
[17:37] you come without any fear
[17:41] because you shall not fail
[17:45] amen amen and uh
[17:48] I'm going to read a scripture
[17:52] uh in
[17:53] let me say that is Matthews 19 Matthew
[17:57] 19 and
[17:59] since it's not
[18:02] I'm not going to prolong the service
[18:06] because it's marriage
[18:09] amen amen
[18:13] you know I
[18:17] I didn't go to school that much
[18:21] it's just by God's grace that because
[18:25] the the greatest language
[18:29] is the word of God
[18:32] the word is a great teacher
[18:37] Jesus to behave and to
[18:42] amen
[18:44] that's a great teacher
[18:47] and we are going to look into this
[18:49] scripture
[18:51] s Matthew
[18:54] Matthew and chapter 19 more chapter 19
[18:59] vers 3 to6
[19:02] bless the reading
[19:04] [Music]
[19:07] I wonder if
[19:09] H our elders here and their families
[19:13] were introduced
[19:19] so that
[19:22] you know if somebody comes to your home
[19:27] to show that day you you accept that as
[19:32] somebody
[19:36] and you are happy that that that
[19:39] somebody
[19:41] has come you will first start by
[19:45] announcing
[19:50] amen amen but otherwise uh since let us
[19:54] just
[19:57] read the scripture
[19:59] chapter 19 Matthew 19 ver 3 to6 vers 3 6
[20:05] the Pharisees also came unto him
[20:08] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[20:11] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[20:13] for every CA and he answered and said
[20:16] unto them have you not read that he
[20:19] which made them
[20:21] at the beginning made them male and
[20:24] female and said for this cause shall a
[20:27] man live five father and mother and
[20:29] shall C to his wife and they twain shall
[20:32] be one flesh wherefore they are no more
[20:35] Twain but one flesh what therefore God
[20:39] have joined together let no man put aand
[20:43] amen amen
[20:45] you may be seated God bless you
[20:49] all right all right because of time let
[20:52] me just say
[20:56] welcome to you all
[20:59] may the Lord bless you
[21:02] amen amen
[21:05] now this is marriage
[21:09] and from God
[21:13] because
[21:15] everything
[21:17] that we do
[21:20] and believe
[21:22] is from God
[21:24] okay amen sometimes
[21:28] we look at our young people today
[21:32] and
[21:34] we
[21:36] pray in my heart
[21:39] that
[21:41] in the last days
[21:45] and my prayer is that this young people
[21:49] roaming the streets
[21:53] amen some come back with children

[22:01] set your ministry
[22:04] to help them marriage is a great thing
[22:08] before God
[22:10] it brings the people together
[22:14] amen amen and
[22:17] man was made in the image of God
[22:21] now we are so thankful
[22:24] at this point in time to have young man
[22:28] and a woman
[22:32] amen amen to have them coming before the
[22:37] altar of God
[22:40] for their marriage
[22:43] it's a wonderful thing because all
[22:46] things started there
[22:49] you know there's no other starting point
[22:53] the starting point
[22:56] God himself because made us in his own
[23:01] now every being
[23:04] of God com back to God
[23:09] amen amen now that's why my brother Here

[24:19] sister
[24:24] now I will just read and officiate
[24:28] not the preaching
[24:31] but I read here the Pharisees also came
[24:37] tempting him
[24:39] saying unto him is it lawful for a man
[24:44] to and not to put his wife away
[24:54] and
[24:55] he answered and said unto them
[24:58] [Music]
[24:59] have you not read
[25:02] that he who made them
[25:06] at the beginning
[25:09] made them male and female
[25:13] [Music]
[25:15] amen amen
[25:18] I believe that a question of this nature
[25:23] is being asked even today
[25:27] because we have divorce
[25:31] [Music]
[25:36] now this is another Court here
[25:39] of God A Wedding Marriage
[25:44] amen Amen brother thank you your parents
[25:46] are also here
[25:49] amen amen chose that it is genuine
[25:55] when we see the parents
[25:57] a blessing I remember the word of the
[26:00] Prophet
[26:03] when he said
[26:06] children
[26:07] respect it was a Mother's Day
[26:11] and he said children respect your mama
[26:16] she was the first one to see you
[26:20] when you AR
[26:23] amen amen so that's a good thing
[26:27] and all of the young people
[26:30] let me finish here the Willing
[26:34] now they ask a question
[26:38] it was concerning
[26:40] divorce
[26:43] and but the answer
[26:47] comes in this way
[26:50] have you not read
[26:53] that he who made them at the beginning
[26:57] you know it goes back to the beginning
[27:02] that's where the starting point
[27:05] if you want to get your thing right
[27:09] to the beginning
[27:11] the foundation of
[27:14] you get it right
[27:16] amen amen
[27:19] some men were sent
[27:22] that of vend
[27:25] there was a tree to be uproot
[27:30] because it was causing AOC
[27:35] then they approach me that such and such
[27:39] a family
[27:41] has asked them us to go and
[27:46] to upro the tree
[27:49] I said but did you understand them
[27:54] they didn't say to cut the tree
[27:58] [Music]
[27:59] to OT
[28:02] amen that means you are going to kill it
[28:06] because once it is uprooted
[28:10] it has lost life
[28:15] if you see a tree there
[28:18] and
[28:20] with blue leaves and so for
[28:24] and uh but if it yes the roots are still
[28:29] there
[28:31] when you see this tree you see the life
[28:34] there
[28:36] you know that benath
[28:40] there's something a life supporting
[28:48] amen amen you know if if you see us like
[28:51] this and with our children growing up to
[28:56] uh special age
[29:01] H because when the time of your wedding
[29:04] arrives
[29:08] that is your special AG
[29:13] amen so you come into terms
[29:17] with life
[29:21] beyond youth
[29:25] okay I now I finished
[29:28] yeah
[29:30] now the Lord answered
[29:34] he didn't say
[29:37] man can leave his wife
[29:41] allow it
[29:43] no listen how he answered
[29:46] have you not read
[29:49] that because if you ask a person
[29:53] another man today
[29:56] say if your wife is troublesome
[30:01] is it lawful that you can teach her
[30:06] for another
[30:13] the door put out yeah but now this is
[30:16] Jesus
[30:19] he can answer in that way
[30:22] he can't say drop
[30:25] because he is the author of it
[30:30] he will bring you back
[30:32] to where it started
[30:36] amen because he say
[30:43] he will T his own plan
[30:49] our God God of restoration
[30:53] he's a great builder of peace
[30:59] so here we are
[31:02] marriage
[31:04] is not something you should be terrified
[31:07] of
[31:08] find God first
[31:11] then if you find God that's where you
[31:14] will find your marriage
[31:17] actually without Christ
[31:20] you cannot
[31:23] find right thing I'm not talking about
[31:26] the woman
[31:29] even your marriage
[31:31] should be directed by him
[31:36] amen if you marry
[31:39] that's why people after getting married
[31:44] [Music]
[31:48] they are not sure of that
[31:51] no that is not from God
[31:54] but aing from God
[31:56] go to the Bible
[31:59] because that where it came from
[32:02] now before we we read
[32:05] and we finished the work here
[32:09] I was just reading this part here
[32:13] listen he says you not not read that he
[32:19] which made them
[32:23] at the beginning
[32:26] made them male and female
[32:31] he made them way
[32:34] in the beginning
[32:37] so that's why we need to go to the
[32:39] beginning
[32:42] if you come
[32:46] it is like when
[32:49] I was buying a second hand
[32:54] then they will tell you
[32:57] uh there's one they call St
[33:04] that one because they say even just
[33:07] after
[33:09] driven out of the gate
[33:12] of that G
[33:14] and should maybe it give you problem
[33:19] you return to
[33:25] [Music]
[33:27] but it's not like that in God
[33:32] God partnership the his creation
[33:39] because that's why he says have you not
[33:44] he which made them
[33:48] when
[33:50] at the beginning
[33:53] you know made them M and and female
[33:59] where it is coming
[34:01] from the beginning
[34:06] and it says and said for this cause
[34:11] shall a man
[34:15] leave father and mother
[34:18] and shall give to his wife
[34:24] say girlfriend no his wife
[34:27] to his wife
[34:30] meaning that God partnership you
[34:38] all right amen now let's have it this
[34:41] way
[34:43] for this cause shall a man
[34:47] leave father and mother
[34:52] brother you are a gr now
[34:55] doesn't say and mother no
[35:00] father and mother
[35:02] and they cling to his
[35:05] all right wife now people Mis interpret
[35:09] this
[35:10] they think
[35:13] teach them
[35:16] okay now according to the word of God if
[35:20] we read we realize that Adam had no
[35:25] father
[35:27] and no mother
[35:29] he was a creation
[35:31] [Music]
[35:32] created
[35:34] by
[35:37] that now this
[35:40] system
[35:43] of father and mother
[35:46] came after
[35:50] from the beginning
[35:53] it was not so
[35:55] can somebody tell us about
[35:59] mother's
[36:03] father
[36:04] no they were he was created
[36:10] and
[36:11] okay now let's finish by saying
[36:19] the Lord said challenge them
[36:23] Pharisees
[36:26] this were the people who to come to
[36:28] Jesus
[36:29] every time just to cause problems
[36:33] now it says and said for this cause
[36:39] which cause have you not read
[36:43] made them
[36:45] at the
[36:50] made them
[36:52] M and female
[36:55] now for this cause
[36:58] that they were made
[37:04] beginning
[37:07] shall
[37:09] uh a man
[37:13] oh where where am I
[37:17] verse five yes all right let me start
[37:20] here and said for this cause
[37:24] shall a man
[37:26] leave father and mother
[37:30] shall
[37:32] to his wife
[37:36] amen amen was it so from the beginning
[37:39] amen
[37:42] okay amen yeah my brother here he looked
[37:47] first in this book
[37:50] and uh he understood it that
[37:55] he should go back to the
[37:59] amen you know and knowing that
[38:03] with a wife from the beginning
[38:08] he's going to start life
[38:11] together with his wife
[38:15] you know the beginning brother
[38:19] we were Bor Sinners
[38:22] after the fall of Adam
[38:26] but
[38:28] God still make it clear to us
[38:34] if we accept Jesus Christ
[38:37] as our savior
[38:39] that means that we are starting from the
[38:42] beginning
[38:44] because he is the beginning
[38:52] we wouldn't have anywhere to go begin
[38:55] regarding the beginning
[38:57] but what he did he knew that it is the
[39:01] blood that caused the problem
[39:04] and he came to die
[39:07] to take away our sin
[39:11] so that to be regarded
[39:15] as the beginning
[39:19] and to have a wife from the beginning in
[39:22] Jesus Christ
[39:26] amen hey my brother you know our
[39:28] beginning
[39:31] accept Christ as your sa
[39:34] you are receiving the beginning
[39:37] amen all things have passed away
[39:41] and God said behold I make all things
[39:45] new
[39:48] we haven't lost that beginning
[39:51] we should only know that is beginning
[39:54] today
[39:55] [Music]
[39:57] and if we accept him
[40:01] then we'll be going back to the
[40:03] beginning
