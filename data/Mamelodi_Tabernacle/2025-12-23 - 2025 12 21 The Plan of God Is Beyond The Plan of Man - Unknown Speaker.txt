Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing the greetings from Zambia. I just I was telling the elders that I I don't want to when I get there I don't just want to say we have a live streaming and streaming I will fish around to look for the children of God that we can fellowship with and I will give them live streaming material. and I did that. Amen. So I met the children of God in the area and the pastor there is pastor Tombo. I spoke to him yesterday saying I must greet the children of God. So we spent time together. uh how I met him. When I get there, I phonet him from Malawi. &gt;&gt; He gave me the number to the pastor of the area by the name of Kalaza Muanza. He's a friend to our elder masid. &gt;&gt; So they met in Tanzania. And then he said to me he will meet me but we haven't met as yet where I'm staying where he's staying with a gap of 200 kilometers. He said there's a pastor around there. You can meet him. He gave me the number and then I met him. We fellowship together say about the word of God had a good time even when I come. I said I'm going back home. He said may God richly bless you as my regards to the church. We will meet again. We had a good time. Amen. So when we were sharing knowing that I come from here in South Africa then when we buried the pastor he said go well and we will talk when you come here. He said to me, "I don't know pastor. I never met him. But I want to tell you one thing here in Africa can be Congo, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, anywhere. When message believer come from South Africa, we listen to them because that's where the prophet was. You start to tell me that your pastor departed at the age of 81. Tells me of something. Then I listened to him. He said the prophet &gt;&gt; must have given him the bait. Amen. If brother &gt;&gt; departed at the age of 55 or 56 and he preached more than 50 years. I never met that old man but I believe that then I said hey if you say that I will take as it is amen so I'm trying to tell you that we are enjoying up there children of God are children of God the spirit is so nice there's nothing you can blame things are just going smooth. So by so saying I'm saying shalom shalom and may God richly bless you as we are going to continue this morning with the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this morning we will read from the Bible. Let's start with Genesis chapter 37. We will read verse 1 to5. Genesis 37 1-5. And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. And the late was with the son of Ba and with the sons of Zera, his father's wives. And Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a coat of many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceibly unto him. And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more &gt;&gt; as we bow it harvest you can lead us in prayer. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father Lord God Almighty here we are this morning we approach your throne of mercy with thanksgiving in our hearts. &gt;&gt; We came Lord Almighty this morning having an expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; To come and hear from you, &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty, what we know and what we have seen throughout ages is that Lord Almighty, &gt;&gt; you always come and speak to us behind the vessel. &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning we pray for our elder Maria standing here behind this blessed pullpit. And father we pray the same anointing that always descend behind this pullpit &gt;&gt; to be in him oh God &gt;&gt; to fill him for him Lord almighty to come and deliver your word which will bless your children and which will take us from one step to another &gt;&gt; which will take us from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty we came Lord Almighty with the same anointing. We say Lord Almighty, let it be the divine and supernatural anointings blending together this morning. Let it be an address from your throne to our thrones. Oh God, we pray, Father, committing the church into your hands, committing the preacher into your hands in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I don't know if uh Brahms from Gani has arrived but he was calling me that is on the way. But I believe Oh, God bless you. &gt;&gt; He's with Elder from uh if he's around, he can raise up his hand. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, thank God for everything. &gt;&gt; Our elder there He's the one that groomed us. &gt;&gt; When I say us, &gt;&gt; those that were in SJ, we they if they are there, they know what I'm talking about. It's a boarding school boarding school where we got the message. He stayed there with his family. on on weekends we will get up together about 20 brothers and then go to his house. He will share the word of God with us. We will do his garden and you know he will cook for the sister will cook cook for us. Mama be he's late now. We we had a good time. I'm just honoring him this morning. Yes. That's we are here. We are because of his teaching. We thank God for everything. May God richly bless you. Amen. And amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone of you this morning. &gt;&gt; So this morning I want to share with you about this title. The plan of God is beyond the plan of a man. You know this morning, everyone of us has plans and even about tomorrow. You have a plan wish to do in life. You have wishes, but that's your plan. And then there's a plan of God that will go beyond your plan. But your plan aligned with the plan of God. You are more than a conqueror. But if your plan is against the plan of God, you'll have a problem in life. So our plan should align plan of God. If it can be like that, you won't have a problem because someone was saying, &gt;&gt; you see the peak, &gt;&gt; it will just get fat. Even if they hate it, &gt;&gt; it doesn't care. When they say those in Maria hate it, &gt;&gt; you will just find it working as f as it can be. It's its nature. &gt;&gt; But the children of God, &gt;&gt; you hate them. God, here we just read. Joseph was hated by his own brother. But at the end, God has made him something. Well, where I want to start to start is from the book of Genesis &gt;&gt; where brother Brennham says in this message faith that was once delivered to the saints. Brother Brennham says Cain &gt;&gt; show he was religious just as religious as the other ones was and religious is a covering Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden when they found out they were naked they made themselves a religion find out just as soon as Adam found out he was separated from God in the state of trying to find God. He tried to hide from God. That's the nature of a man today. It's still his nature instead of coming down confessing saying I've been a church member for 10 years. I know nothing about God and try to hide behind the name of a church. Now, I want you to notice instead of coming out and it ought to have been Adam running through the garden, hollering. Father, father, where are you? Father, father. But it was the father running through the gardening Adam where can you see that? But I want to tell you this morning that was the plan of God. Adam &gt;&gt; never intended to do what he did. Eve never intended to do what she did, but the plan of God allowed them for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. They just became the keys of life, the keys of the plan of God. that should start with them because God in his plan wanted to be a savior to be a redeemer to be a comfort to be our father and to be the bridegroom. That was the plan of God. And for the plan of God to be achieved, if must fall because God planned this thing before the foundation of the world. When this happened, it was the manifestation of what God has planned. I'm saying this because many people that cannot clearly see they say if if never did this, if Adam never did this, we could have been saved with God. Brothers and sisters, it's not like that. The plan of God was them be in that situation for God to be the savior. to be the redeemer so that we can be the bride of the Lord. If this has never happened, we wouldn't have been here this morning. We wouldn't have been the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. But for the bride of Jesus Christ, Eve and Adam must be in that situation. And from that time, a man was running from the presence of God. And from that time, God was calling upon the man. God himself would take them out of the garden of Eden with the flaming sword on the edge of the gate bringing them back and the salt is the word of God. Amen. So it happens like that. Now let's continue to our scripture and the quote that I'm going to read. Israel and the church. Now watch. Now watch. When everything heaped up in Joseph, what a perfect man. The the one who was born of his father, loved of his father, hated of his brother. Loved of his father. hated of his brothers. The Lord Jesus watch acting out every character in there. Look at Joseph the perfect one. This is natural as well. You see, if a man can have many kids, one or two he will love more than the others. And if the others realize that they will hate him, there was never even a man who say I love my kids the same. Never. But you will say, "I love my kids." And tell the people that I love my kids. But in your heart, you say, "I will love this one the most." And this other one must not know and other people must not know. But there are certain things you cannot hide because Jacob being Israel, he did everything for them. But with Joseph, he did what is in his heart. And they have realized that this is loved by the father. They hated him. Why they hate him? &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, for no reason. As I read, watch how it was portrayed in Jesus. His father loved him. His brothers, hated him without a cross. He was spiritual, could foretell things, could interpret dreams. He couldn't help being that. You know, brothers and sisters, who we are, &gt;&gt; it's not what we choose, it's what God has given us, but others will hate you for what God has gave you. And at the end as an individual you you don't know what to do because maybe Joseph was praying because he was spiritual and saying God Lord God I pray that you help me for my brothers not to hate me. This thing that makes me hated by them. let them go away because I want my brothers and myself to embrace one another. And God was listening to his but after that he gave him a dream. When he give him a dream, the dream was we were in the field and we have sheep and yours, your sheep fell before mine. And a dream is something you cannot control. A vision is something that you cannot convey. If God shows vu visions, it will come like that. If God shows you a dream, you are unconscious but it happen in your subconscious. It just come you never ask there amongst you who can tell you that what you're going to dream tonight when you are sleeping. Is there anyone who can tell me that? No, you don't know. But at night, you will have a dream and you do not have a control over that dream. Joseph was like that. He never had a control over his dream. But he shared a dream to his brothers and they hated him. Agreed. They started counting. 11 sheep &gt;&gt; fell before one. This one is him. 11 is others. This man is undermining us. I will show him. Then they go and plan. Hey. The people plan &gt;&gt; and they will plan about you. But the plan of man cannot outshine the plan of God. &gt;&gt; They go to the field and look after the sheep and the cow everything. When they were there, he heard them speaking bad things about their father, the one who brought them on earth. Then Joseph, because he was young, they were elders. He said, "I don't know what to do. I must just tell my dad." Then he will get home and say, "Daddy, I was with my brothers. They were talking about you and nothing good about you. They were just talking bad things about you. Do you understand? And Joseph said, "I can't take it. I don't know what to do." &gt;&gt; But that's what God has given him. &gt;&gt; One of the days he dreamed again he said, "No, this one I will never tell them because when I tell them is the more they hate me. And they don't know my brothers. They don't know. I love them so much, but they hate me. And I don't know what to do because what I have is a God-given gift. He said, "Daddy, I had a dream. I saw the sun and the moon and the 11 stars. Then they say stop there. I can see where you are going. Stop there. When the brothers hear that the Bible says they hated him yet the more if the hatred was 60%. It went to 100%. The only thing that they can do is to eliminate him &gt;&gt; so that there will be no dreams. They went and plan that is why if you go to the taxi industry you will not survive. Hey, there's people they blend. They check your movement. If they want to eliminate you, what time you wake up, what time you go to sleep, what time you go to work, what time you go to shopping, how many people you, they will trace you, the day they hit you, it's just once. Now, Joseph's brothers, I had a meeting and plan about Joseph that this man want to kill him. One of the days they saw him coming. They say they also thank the Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; you brought him right. &gt;&gt; There he come. &gt;&gt; This must be the will of God. We are going to kill him today. That that is the plan of man. But we'll never outshine the plan of God. He was happy having food for them, having greetings from the parents from embracing them. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, greeting them with the holy kiss. They were cleing their teeth that today repeat itself. challenge. Joseph comes &gt;&gt; they take the food they don't deny the food they take them and they eat thinking of how do we approach to murder him I don't know maybe they had drivers graves enjoying but when the time arrives we execute you know the blood of men cannot outshine the plan of God. Go and plan and your plan must align with the plan of God. If not the plan of God, brothers and sisters, we better stop. Then he come they us &gt;&gt; they even plan lies we're going to kill him and tell they at home that the animals or everything hey people can plant &gt;&gt; they even planted by &gt;&gt; but there was an elder amongst He said to them, "Brothers, the person you are talking about is one of our people is our father's son. How can we do s you understand? Then they started to hear this one is working against us." They went, &gt;&gt; you understand? and to try to kill him. But once safe, we'd rather kill an animal, put the blood in his clothes, go home so that we can so we can find money, we're going to sell him. So at least the plan of selling him worked very well and they sold him to the Ishmalites. But they don't know that is the plan of God. You know when Joseph was born, God saw him as the prime minister in Egypt. But when you saw him, you saw him as somebody who is dead. You say he's dead. God is the prime minister. Which one is going to pass? Here is the plan of God. Here is the plan of God. Children of God, walk upon the will and the plan of God. wrong. They sold him. They were happy. No more dreams. No more spiritualists. No more person that is reporting us to the father. No more this. But the only one that remain is Benjamin. &gt;&gt; A little brother of Joseph. Ah, but this one is a toothless lion. &gt;&gt; A shy boy. He doesn't dream. He doesn't say anything. We don't have a problem. But that one we sold to him. But the dream will stay. The vision will stay. You can try to cover it, try to kill it. It will stay. because that's the plan of God. They sold him and when they get to Egypt, he worked in Egypt as a slave. Then he dreamed in Egypt. The dreams in Egypt uplifted Egypt and the the king of Egypt said, "This young man, I need him." Remember his own brothers don't need him but Egypt needed him. He stayed there. He grew up there and one of the days he was uplifted to be the prime minister in Egypt. You know the plan of God. So those that were enjoying grapes and beldons there, having those meetings there. &gt;&gt; You know the plan of God will put you in a squeeze until the person you hate, you will go and bo. That is the plan of God. And their father said, "Come here. You can see we no longer have food here. Go and hunt around." The only place that they knew had food was Egypt they were going 10 of them. 10 of them because Benjamin was still young. &gt;&gt; They went there. When they get there, they asked for food. They were given go back home. But Joseph said to them, "You are not all the one that is remaining at home. Bring him." They went back home, "But no, no, we won't go back there. That man is not good. We will not bring this one." But go back there. Send them back again. &gt;&gt; They had to bring Benjamin. When they get there, you know the story. Joseph, you know, revealed himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am Joseph, your brother." &gt;&gt; Now, the sun and the moon and the stars bow before him and they started to realize that the 11 sheep was them. &gt;&gt; Joseph still standing. &gt;&gt; They bow before him. Why it was the plan of God? I'm always saying one brother called me and say brother relaxation because I say relax in the word of God. Let God do the work. Don't sweat like this and death. You will fail and die of heart attack. &gt;&gt; But if you can be like Joseph when they sell him, you say, "Lord God, you know better." If they accuse him, you say, "Lord God, you know better." If he's in the jail in Egypt, he said, "Lord God, you know better." Until God himself sended him. &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning? &gt;&gt; A child of God is someone who does things soberly. But I want to tell you when you see the people are in group they are dangerous you know what they doing &gt;&gt; they are lying one to another &gt;&gt; we'll tell him &gt;&gt; there's nothing like that let me advise you listen to your conscience that's where God stay and God will give you the guidance. You know, God will never leave us astray. Then the brothers of Joseph started to realize this man has defeated us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we thought we can kill him. We failed. We thought we can sell him. We failed. Today we bow before him. This is the work of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm wondering when I was preparing this message, it's always 10 against two. Always. It was brothers of Joseph against him and Benjamin because Jacob being Israel loved &gt;&gt; Joseph &gt;&gt; and Benjamin &gt;&gt; because the Bible says he got them at his old age and he loved them. But the 10 there were problem. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; How many spies did Moses send? &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; 12. How many came with a good report? How many came with a bad report? There's a problem with 10. He sent 12 10k. Then they said to Moses, "But we are in the church in the service." &gt;&gt; Let's read that scripture again. Numbers chapter 13. &gt;&gt; You You will read from verse one. &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 13 from verse one. And the Lord spoke spake unto Moses, saying, Send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers shall he send a man, everyone a ruler among them. And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the wilderness of Pon. All those men were heads of the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were heads. in the &gt;&gt; Yes. You see? Amen. &gt;&gt; He choose the head and he say you go if you read verse four going down those are the names. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now they went there and they must give the report. Can we read the report? Verse 26. 26 &gt;&gt; going to 28. And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Pon to Kadesh, and brought back word unto them, and unto the unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him and said, We came unto the land whether thou sendest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are world, and every great, and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they went there, &gt;&gt; they were singing a song saying in the what are we going to sing in &gt;&gt; 12 of them understand saying Lord &gt;&gt; it's you leading us Lord it's you leading us and the Lord when they get there the status change maybe They were walking spying the land. &gt;&gt; Joshua was with Caleb. &gt;&gt; This one was this one. With this one, maybe he was taking a corner or maybe behind a tree somewhere. Then he saw a man with six fingers. This is a man with six fingers. When he look at himself, that man was double his size. &gt;&gt; Then he took notes. &gt;&gt; Agree. They must give the report. &gt;&gt; They must give a report. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They took notes. Then when they get there to Moses and Aaron, &gt;&gt; they give the report. &gt;&gt; Grapes. &gt;&gt; They came with the grapes. &gt;&gt; Milk and honey. the fruits, the fruit of the land and everything. They said that land is very much good, is very much rich. Nevertheless, those people are strong. Stronger than who? Stronger than the Lord? No, they cannot be stronger than now. They come with evil report to the ch. They said to the children of Israel to the can we read it, you know, um just like they could say 26. So let's read verse 26. And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel. Moses and all the congregation. &gt;&gt; So they give the congregation and Moses and Aaron the report. They say we won't make it. Those people are more powerful than us. And that is true. They were more powerful than them, but they are not powerful to God. Golad was more powerful than David, but he was not powerful than God. Should we rely on ourselves, on our effort in the plan of God? Amen. If you read verse one, it says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses." So God had a plan. Had a saying that he give to Moses. He give to Moses and Moses to the 12 spies. And the 12 spies to the congregation. And the congregation must accept the report because those people were not ordinary where they hat amongst their tribe but they came &gt;&gt; with the wrong report. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like verse 30. &gt;&gt; Read it for us. And Caleb still the steilled the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it." &gt;&gt; That's Caleb. &gt;&gt; Caleb said right there in the congregation, let us go up. He killed the people. He comfored them. He told them that in Israel there is God because the report came saying we are crers before that. But Caleb says we will eat them last contrary to the report of 10 men. Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; listen to your conscience. &gt;&gt; Read verse 32 for us. &gt;&gt; Verse 32. But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness. &gt;&gt; Uh 32. Is it true? &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eatth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. &gt;&gt; 33 &gt;&gt; And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anch, which come which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When he he he he become &gt;&gt; the 10 spies &gt;&gt; became the spokesperson &gt;&gt; of the devil. &gt;&gt; The spokesperson of those people. &gt;&gt; They are going to eat us. We are like grasshoppers today. So he speak for them, but they never said so. &gt;&gt; But wait until chapter 14 of the same uh uh Bible verse 24. &gt;&gt; Verse 24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land where into we went, and his seed shall possess it. &gt;&gt; This is what we need. &gt;&gt; We need people like Caleb. &gt;&gt; We need people like Joshua who had another spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can have the spirit of God. We can all believe in God. But we need someone who had another spirit to see that. Those are the ones that we need. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to be in the message. It's not enough to worship in Mommy Lord. It's enough to have another spirit. &gt;&gt; A pastor, our pastor has told me a lot of things. But one of the thing he told me is a brother right there in our church in Modi. Few will be raptured. I like pastor what are you saying? &gt;&gt; He said because God has made me to start that church and I know how it ends. He started to tell me in the early '7s &gt;&gt; when he received the spoken word and he tells me I will go to an end. He said will be in the rapture. I'm sorry about that. Others will not like it but I have to say it. I'm sorry about that. 10 against two 10 brothers of Joseph against him and Benjamin this 10 against Joshua and Caleb it's not about the number it's about what you have if you have another spirit that's what God wants Jesus How many disciples? &gt;&gt; 12. So it's 12. Get 12. &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; How many stood by the side of Jesus? You are quiet because you don't know. I will give you an answer. too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we read a scripture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because in the Bible, &gt;&gt; how many disciples who said to who said that who said Jesus loved them the most over the others? Let me help you &gt;&gt; with the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um Mark chapter 10 35. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 10:35. And James and John the son of Zebedee come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou should us do for us whatsoever we shall desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go further until 38. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, what would ye that I shall do for you? They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in thy glory. But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what he ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read what brother says. &gt;&gt; You know, one time The mother &gt;&gt; of James and John, we won't have time to read it, but the mother of James and John came and asked for a place. You know that remember that the L Lord let my sons said on one side on the other side there's a mother desire for her son. Now the Bible says Jesus had 12 disciples. Having 12 disciples, there were two that he loved the most is John and James. He loved John so much until he led him in Patmos. The vision. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; John and James &gt;&gt; against her. &gt;&gt; He was loved by Jesus. &gt;&gt; Even the Bible says, &gt;&gt; let's read it in Matthew chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Read verse 1 then we'll read 5-9. &gt;&gt; Matthews chapter 10 verse 1 then 5-9. And when he had called unto him his 12 disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Verse five. &gt;&gt; Yes. To &gt;&gt; these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles and into the city of the Samaritans. Enter ye not, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, rise the dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your pes. &gt;&gt; He called them &gt;&gt; 12. That means his love &gt;&gt; amongst them was not equal. &gt;&gt; He will say to Peter, &gt;&gt; the day you transform, you the day you repent, the day you transform, strengthen your brothers. But he will say to Thomas because you do not believe come and check I was crucified. You know that time when he's talking there John the revelator he's sleeping at Jesus bos while he was sleeping there the others looking at him they started to hate him. Yeah, this man &gt;&gt; loved us, &gt;&gt; but he loved that one &gt;&gt; the most. That's what the Bible says. That's what the brother says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was always like that. Jesus knowing their heart, he continued saying, read verse 34. Verse 34. &gt;&gt; Think not that I am come to send peace on earth. And &gt;&gt; 35 &gt;&gt; I came not to send peace, but I but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. &gt;&gt; Is the same chapter &gt;&gt; that I was reading. It was Jesus Christ addressing them. When you say peace, peace, peace, then destruction will come. He said, I bring the sword. What is the sword? The sword is the word of God. Brother Brenam received the sword and that sword tend to be the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not me, but the pastor in Zambia said to me, I believe that sword, brother fell in the hand of your pastor. He's listening. He's streaming. &gt;&gt; That is the plan of God. Can we outshine the plan of God? Can we? Who are we? We can't. &gt;&gt; The devil has failed. &gt;&gt; The the children of Israel failed. &gt;&gt; The spies failed. The disciples of Jesus Christ failed. Today, we will fail to be against the plan of God. You can. That is why here in the word of God. You just walk and walk one of the day it will be the last walk. And the Bible says Enoch walk and walk and walk. One day he was no more. I don't have a record &gt;&gt; of Enoch having troubles doing a lot of things. &gt;&gt; The Bible just say he walked with God. Can you just walk with God and get into the people are busy left right center our sweat in the will of God at nothing doesn't adv us say something. Hey, the children of God are special people are special breed. The one that God has made the word of God. You don't have to worry, church. Things &gt;&gt; are in control. God has never made a mistake. &gt;&gt; I repeat, God has never made a mistake. &gt;&gt; So when the disciples of Jesus Christ given power for healing, for casting out demons, it was not enough for them. They they wanted something again because if God gives this man this, that man, that one, then this one will love to be this one. This one will love to be that one, that one will want that one because a human being has never get satisfied. But in the word of God, we live to be satisfied of what God has given us. They hated John the Revelator for nothing. For nothing and what John had is what God has given him. If I hate you for what God has given you, you will be hurt myself because the plan of God cannot be outshined. Brothers and sisters, go home with that word. The word and the plan of God cannot be outshined by the plan of man. That is why I have told myself and you must tell yourself that I must just walk on the plan of God. I want to tell you this. God, do you still believe in God has prepared everything before the foundation? What is happening today is the manifestation of what God has planned. You cannot come here this morning and change what God did before the foundation of the world. Why? Are you worried? He has done it all. Those that are need healing, he has done it all. those that need job. He has done it all. Wait for the day of manifestation. &gt;&gt; If you don't find the time, &gt;&gt; wait for the time. &gt;&gt; It's not that. Amen. Yeah, left, right, center, right? &gt;&gt; Looking for something that you cannot get, &gt;&gt; but God has placed you somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm trying to tell the to tell the children of God again relaxing the word &gt;&gt; he he has done it all. &gt;&gt; One young man was telling me the sisters are rejecting me. I have tried and tried. &gt;&gt; You know why? They were not yours. Yours is the one that you have today. God has never made a mistake. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you that. &gt;&gt; Do not complain. Just say he has done it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus, &gt;&gt; he's answering John and James. &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you need?" &gt;&gt; Let's read it in verse 36. &gt;&gt; Verse 36. &gt;&gt; Yes. Mark Mark 10. Yeah. Mark 10. &gt;&gt; Chapter 10:36. And he said unto them, "What would ye that I should do for you?" Then said unto him, "Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand, and the other on the left hand in thy glory." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Ye know not what you ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with?" Now you read verse 40 and 41. &gt;&gt; But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whom it is prepared. &gt;&gt; For whom it is prepared. &gt;&gt; For whom who it is. &gt;&gt; Prepared. That means God has done the preparation. When he has prepared you and prepared for you, you will be given not your effort. Verse 41. &gt;&gt; And when the 10 heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. when said the Bible said the 10 of it were much displeased with John and James. I was surprised as well that when all these 12 will be right 10 10 12 right 12 wrong here 10 wrong two right amongst those 10 was had 12 disciples. &gt;&gt; The one that he loved &gt;&gt; is John and James. The remaining 10, Peter is there. Thomas is there. Mark is there. Barthome is there. Those 10 were displeased of the request of John and James. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the word of God, &gt;&gt; it's not about a huge number what the people say this and this, but it's about those that stood for the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what matters. That is why the words of the pastor are still hollering in my ear. Pastor said when I start few when it come to an end there will be few go and plan but let your plan be the plan of God if is the plan of you without God I'm not I wanted to tell you about the journey of Peter uh Paulo &gt;&gt; Apollo &gt;&gt; but is for other day but with this 10 today my message is about the plan that will go beyond the plan of men and when I preparing the message just give me 10 and two 10 and two and 10 and two. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; History. &gt;&gt; Repeat itself. &gt;&gt; You can kill the body and the spirit, but my soul is in Christ. If your soul is in Christ, that's what matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't toy against the word of God, &gt;&gt; but I will align with the word of God. And if someone is going to hell, brothers and sisters, God has planned that can change it. Unfortunately, there are creatures. They are creatures of hell in the church. Be careful of what you hear. Be careful what you speak. Listen to your conscience. I want to tell you this. I want to tell you this. You see there are time of talking. There are time of telling the truth. If you can find that person will just say no they are just making me do this. &gt;&gt; Listen it &gt;&gt; to your conscience. &gt;&gt; That's where God &gt;&gt; speak to you. This woman is talking about a mother to John and James said to Jesus, "I want my son to be on your left." That request, it was aligned with the plan of God. It happened exactly like that. When you go to the city to come, you find them there at the right place that was said while they were here on earth. God has never made a mistake. When you go to the city to come, you will find 12 patriarchs 12 disciples. When you go in, you will find us, &gt;&gt; the bride. Brother Brenham, &gt;&gt; Brother &gt;&gt; when he depart, &gt;&gt; he was about to preach the message the trail of the serpent. Now I've read many people message believers complaining complaining why it was not preached why it was not preached wanted to hear that brothers and sisters the pastor has preached about it &gt;&gt; I've heard some believers saying pastor could have been here and Tell us about the white stone interpretation. Hey, wake up. You are the white throne interpretation. Because when you go in the new city, you find yourself in the pyramid, being the bride of Jesus Christ. You know what people think. They don't allow God to go with his plan. They go with their own thinking in the word of God. That is why we fail. &gt;&gt; God has never made a mistake to take our pastor. If you don't know, he told me, he said, "Bra, I'm going." And he's gone because God has planned it. What was the plan of God? At the right time, the appointed time to take a man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I haven't seen &gt;&gt; God making a mistake. No many wise that we have we have the answers I'm going to stop my message here this morning but I just want to tell the church I'll speak something but in front of the church there's many things but I just want to thank Omar Omar I was in the hospital with the pastor until he depart. Then something came to me that when brother Brenham did things still did not was not going well and God said to him, "Your wife is disrespectful. I'm going to kill her." Brother Brandham said to God, "You will never kill my wife because this woman is looking after me. He's looking after my kids. He's looking after my diet. He's looking after everything. He's supporting this ministry." And God, I want to tell church this morning, you're just looking at the pastor, but you are not looking at the woman behind the pastor who was looking after the diet of the pastor. When the pastor was dressing well, it's because of the woman. I I I'll just say in front of the church, you did a good job, mama, &gt;&gt; and may God richly bless you with what you did. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's clap hands for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, God bless you. Amen. Amen. H Let's stand on our feet. The sisters will give us a song. We have a baptismal service. So before the baptismal service, I will ask just to come forth for a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give us a song. God bless you. Oh my holy one. Oh yeah.

Lord, &gt;&gt; things that are visible and the things that are invisible. &gt;&gt; God who showed the visions and dreams and interpreted &gt;&gt; in those days in the days of Joseph &gt;&gt; and you said Joseph was anointed with the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; He was perfectly Lord &gt;&gt; and he demonstrated every word that was written about him. And in the days of our Lord Jesus, it was the same ministry Lord &gt;&gt; with the first pool, third pool and Lord in the last days again through the ministry &gt;&gt; that you gave to the prophet of our day. &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet as you have promised that spirit five times Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It happened exactly according to your word. And Lord, all along we're saying and telling the whole world that after that great ministry, there was also a man in Africa, &gt;&gt; our pastor. Lord, &gt;&gt; you put something in him, &gt;&gt; that no man can match. Father, we thank you. We are eyewitnesses of that &gt;&gt; this afternoon.

Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
