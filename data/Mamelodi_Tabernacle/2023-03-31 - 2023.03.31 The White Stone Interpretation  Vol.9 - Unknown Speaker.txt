standing here in your place hallu this is not a place of man is a place of the supernatural this is only the [Music] body the body which we are used to see and the voice which you are used to hear heavenly father I pray take over use the body amen use the eyes hallah use the ears use the mouth use the voice Lord your children in their hearts are waiting to hear their father speaking to [Applause] them heavenly father I am surrendering myself interpreter the pastor in the church unto thy hands take over lord as I pray Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we will read the same scriptures amen amen after the pastor has prayed for us and I'm looking forward to to be blessed by God if you are ready brother amen you can just read Revelation 2:1 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to to eat of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 11 to3 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Amen God bless you as you take your seat amen amen uh I will start by reading something here before we let's just commit ourselves you know a brother was asking me a question saying uh you are a stout man amen amen then I said I said to that that outside stoutness now has gone inside amen amen amen okay we are all of us all time here uh our pastor here why I want his photo to accompany my photo because we started together back [Music] there and walked together long distance in this areas as he was leading me to use a parents place still remember and we are together still still working together amen amen you start like in a physical form but when you come to the end of the natural you find your still still moving working together but now in the spiritual form showing that um the distance taken by the physical form is so short then we were many in physical numbers but at the end of it all uh we are not many in the physical [Music] numbers we have [Music] shrink Supernatural numbers we have sh back to the supernatural it was just one H mile of light then brother Bram says from that came forth because the son says this natural things the first thing was SL was the son amen amen and uh I'm reading something here H that shows where I am where we are coming from is from a single in the beginning was light amen amen now that's why the prophet taught me that it started from one thing as he he says we were chosen in before amen amen before all right amen we have no Foundation but when he started the church he spoke of the foundation of the prophets and then Apostles that's the foundation started there but you go back you wind back we find only one thing when he spoke in this book Ephesians chapter [Music] 4: just let's let's hear it amen and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption Ephesians for yes sir grieve not the holy spirit of God yes where you are SE the day now meaning that and he says the day of redemption is the day the book is open you see amen Redemption has come uh to to to those who were chosen but it says before that's why when you arrived when he arrived he said of us he said the the world hatte them and the world hated to them the reason that they are not of this [Applause] world we are we are okay now let us read this part here seven I have book Seven SE and don't even don't lose even one of them brother I had my book set ready here okay let me read that again uh from the book of is this the time amen amen and in this book says is this the time let me read it all right amen uh that is [Music] from that is page 26 I will read from this place here before we start reading amen you know brother br God spoke to him uh he was not preaching to us after he has read us a book he God spoke to [Music] us through brother he he became God's book now if you don't see it from that book you haven't heard what God has said because the first book of God is aen am amen amen so that's how we receive the message of God don't look around and like saying I want to hear what that brother would say want to know what he would say about this go straight to the book the seventh angel messenger the speaking book The Talking book amen amen you won't miss a spiritual point yeah this is in writing amen but you won't get it right until you read the speaking [Applause] book amen amen so I we we are looking here at the speaking book The Prophet has spoken amen amen now how do you keep the word of the [Music] Prophet because nobody will keep the word of the Prophet for you it should be something personal to you amen amen that's why now if God takes his prophet Lees a Shepherd the work of the me as a Shepherd is to see that the sheep have they keep on or they kept the word from the living and breathing word of of God so that's why to me brother BR uh I took him as a living [Music] speaking that's why even today I'm still with him amen amen and he has also given me a [Music] pastor now I read in the Bible here we will realize that we are being of Eternity because the prophet says everything that was created has an maybe did you hear it I think I've got the [Music] book yes if not I can just quote I don't see the other books here oh yeah CH yes sir without a an out cover almost most of my books but they are still much alive I read here page 21 2 that is the SM I can't prounce it yes Church H in every church we are told that there's tws you find twins in every Church amen meanwhile borrow me the Rapture if you've got one day now in every Church age you find that said the prophet and throughout the seven Church ages you find Twins and he says one is spiritual and the other one all right and they won go together up to the end it was and they could not go together to the end they were twins one was one was spiritual in every Church age we have said the prophet of God and the spiritual in every church amen amen so I read here and the blood test shows whether you are or whether you of God or [Music] not blood test because the prophet told us that when H Gabriel the prophet Gabriel came to Mary amen am and they spoke to Mary and Mary received the word from the angel you know there's another book here I will find it where John said to that man Prophet Angel and the angel said to [Music] John what the what did the angel say says I'm one of your fellow servants worship God yes amen because he wanted to worship that angel the was so strong in the soul of John until he he wanted to worship and that angel said don't don't because I am amen let me look at it here because we coming to that distinctive [Music] Angel right in the end time because the message now is of uh pyramid of the Angels am amen am not of bricks that one who's this brother who had a dream junior junior Jackson junior Jackson he looked at the structure there and uh he says then brother Bram brother interpreted to him that structure this structure it started with the Cornerstone now brother Sayed to the Head St now but I before we start let me read this uh firstly and the blood test shows whether you are of God or not because he says the the angel came to Mary and the angel spoke to Mary and when Mary lived what was revealed to her or told to became blood that's said the prophet God it became that's why I think so many people do not understand about this King men redeem what does Kings [Music] mean the Kings now it says the book was in the hand of Adam when Adam fuled then it went back to the original owner now this original owner came as a king's man and they were surprised when we look at that SC that [Music] scripture we were saved by the by the blood of [Applause] the the Lord Jesus is a family to to us now we couldn't be saved by any blood it should be the blood of the kingsman it makes us one with him amen amen we cannot because we are saved by the blood of our King's Men amen amen amen God wanted us to be exactly like him to be him am am amen that's what Redemption means Redeemed by the blood of the king amen amen you know once it is the blood of the kingsman then no no one will follow you with some harsh words love one another pay your ti don't you know because the blood is of the king if we are all redeemed we were Redeemed by the blood of the k then you don't even need to encourage encourage us to love one another the BL that speaks that's why he didn't come and say Adam why why why did you do this why you do this no he shed his blood you know I love that when brother says when he died and he was buried you know three days then he says because uh he took when he he comes into the gap yes standing in the Gap standing in the gap which Gap because men and God were one he tells you even in this book Christ is the mystery of God and God were and then he says men and God are one here the real Church of of God the of Christ is Al andega he is om now when Gabriel brought the word he brought the seat of God to that vir Mar Maria amen amen you'll watch later about Sarah and Abraham [Music] amen it say Sarah what happened to Sarah to be with sah yeah it ceased to be with Sarah according to the manner of women you know where it is brother it ceased to be with according to the man of okay amen so the the church the maners of the church like you know if you can look at the woman today with a woman without God and you look at the men now a church without the seventh seal you look at the man you can see that something is wrong here the Bible says ited to be with sah amen according it SE to be amen amen it was not the the manner of women you have that scripture it seed meaning that before the bright is taken away she is without the man of women meaning the manner of churches churches meaning the church has got Menace but the bride of Christ it seed the manner of the bride of Christ is not like the men of women amen where is it brother Genesis Genesis chter 18 vers 11 yes can you LIF Your Voice verse 11 now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women right amen well strien in age no manner of women hallelujah amen when the bride arrive at that position where the man is not of women you know that it is the end let us read now now I've been looking for such uh to meet such people it is like you read about madc who is thisis it is a question then while it remains as a question then the prophet says I met now if your Prophet then he came and asked a question have you met you know how we we we went through that all right because that came as a in the last days all right am then brother bam say now if you are uh the message believer if the prophet has met M he then he said you should meet amen I I I think you've seen that we went through that then he asked a question have you met M amen and of course the people wondered how the prophet is a man like you and me and if he meets me you should meet but we'll come to that amen I read this part here what was the scripture brother okay let me the man yes now I read from this book is this the that's when it rolled into the end [Music] time then he asked says is it the T then it continues to say uh you know there was a blast and uh he saw that the lightning and then coming down he says but it shook the Earth and when it did I was still looking wor now uh the first day back you realize that men was placed eward the Garden of Eden now you have east and west you know to look on your board here the direction the here this scripture in this book it introduced East and West men was placed East and that's why the prophet in order to connect with the supernatural to go [Music] west and the prophet also came they came to meet the prophet okay now I read uh it shook the earth when it did I was still looking Westward meaning he was e he was in the East and way of into eternity amen then because the angel every time you see an angel you believe that he is from eternity he's an angel amen amen now that's why we will come quickly to the H pyramid of angels where e I was reading something here where it it tells me of this year amen oh the angel you know how that man the angel came to I had it here with me brother just now ameny no that angel oh John bow down to worship an angel did you see what happened there and the angel said don't do it and you know I had the page right now here to show something the angel said don't bow to worship me me I am I am I'm am th fellow servant one of your brethren yes amen I'm one of the Brethren now brother Bram says it must have been Elijah or one of the prophets but the Bible says it was an angel H all right that's why at the end when after the church ages he speaks of the of this distinction Angel distinctive distinctive angel now he say you see I heard the page right now but you know it but the prophet of God says it must have been Elijah or why because he knows that it was a man amen amen amen and of course we do will'll come to a flying angel when he he speaks of the flying angel what happened there all right but this one he says it's a worshiper that angel said I'm also a worshiper but the Bible says it is an angel now the angel explained John that I am also one of them and brother said it must have I said amen amen amen amen amen because uh if at the end we see this Angel are coming like an angel then we know then he says we know all right I'll come to that to read it better but we know that the distinctive Angel is only one angel amen you have oneel let me read amen this is now we are entering the new [Music] Commission because the first commission was of healing of the SE the gospel preaching of the Gospel that was the old commission but the the the new Commission like if we talk about the pools the first was small B the second the second the do thir the Angels amen am so now but here I wonder my what happened to my page but you know it amen amen amen that he says that angel must have must have been Elijah or one of the prophets and I was reading alone there I said yes elah all right amen don't think of wings Wings think of an Angel because even here it introduced it said the distinctive angel on the right hand [Music] side okay the right hand [Music] side and uh a brother SC at me when I said something like people of the right hand they thought I was talking about amen am the book of H John chapter 5 what happened there brother before we start here and even finish okay amen Revelation chapter 5 yes and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven Cals yes on the on the back side I see on the right hand right hand what a book and say amen amen let leave it until we read it am he speaks also of the right hand the mysteries of God came down from the right s the book was in the right hand then when the book was on the right hand in the right hand now if you go down from the right you find the angel on the right the came from the right hand side the angel on the right hand side to the right hand people the true bride of Christ is the people that are on the right and they are not confused because they are the right hand when God dispatched something it comes down the right that's that book uh no one could handle that book only Adam because Adam was the right hand that's why we standing in the game the G was caused by the absence of Adam God and Men I'll read it to you that is in the book of Christ is the mystery of God is the Myster of God the prophet says and men were one there and God and men one here amen that's why we don't talk about churches no we are talking God and Men right there amen where we one day amen and then he says now God and man are [Music] one am don't become a church Go part of God because a church go stable that's why I've seen some people they come to church as the pastor maybe uh he stands for as the pastor's interpreter sorry he is the pastor's [Music] interpreter and taking some notes when the book of the notes is full now you can't start a church you can't start a church with quotations our quotations God is Not quotations God is a spirit they they that worship him they don't worship him through quations worship him through the spirit because God is where before he could send them he said wait in Jerusalem then I'll come to you now as a spirit because the true worshipers him in and Truth am all right amen you see that is that now I've seen some people after interpreting they become Pastors in personation brother B says impersonation is dangerous because it's not God it is you because that one said that word you are only repeating what another one has said but when the we comes from the prophet notation it's the wa from God to you reputation is dangerous if you take it from somebody who has missed a point you will also but if it is from God it comes through the prophet amen amen the prophet will never [Applause] miss amen but I've seen some people they take from another man from God impersonation it is dangerous because you can respect a man and if what if that man is not in the right place and you take from him this this is what has confused and the churches because it's impersonation everywhere look how many churches we've got today you come in one location you find this is the message Church why they can't come together this one says seals are not re this one says this and that one says amen amen amen his children H they came through impersonation but if it is from God to the prophet to the Past amen amen it is something that's of godine all right Amen Let me before includes with this uh we I haven't started but here here is something I say brother Bram asked a question the angel said the Bible says that angel let's talk about that angel don't do it don't it it but when he looks at it that's why you look at the distinctive Angel and I remember brother sometimes he shed tears some tears because when people said to him he is God Amen and yet the word says the sons of God Amen am it caused a lot of dust when we were reading from The Prophet's book the sons of [Applause] God Amen because God yeah yeah God [Music] be amen now brother bam brother bam he come straight and say sons of God are Min God because God can only give birth to a god amen okay amen how many amens [Applause] here get but only the gods we could not worship but because they are from God are God how can God trust pastor and say look after my sheep unless he is a [Applause] God God don't take that chance if you say man look after my sheep that means god has given this man a [Applause] godship amen amen that's how it goes the true pastors that's why he says you listen to your [Music] pastor it is in your book adoption I remember there was an outcry after we have read that quotation that we are because now this God minor God he brings to you the word of God amen am he's a minor God God will never say I will come myself there he sent to you because a Son of God is a god amen amen I'm me an African I'm a son of an African made as Gods B even say are PRI in Christ all right all all right all right let

brothers how we I think brother is here we were in Malawi and when I I we were in Malawi Satan knowing that never seen like sat you know knowing that the pastor then he was trying to attack child

the children's birth days are in the when uh brother was preaching brother when he was preaching he was praying for a possessed person that demon said you know the pastor is always talking preaching to you preaching to you about this because that that man was possessed while the brother was preaching praying and a demon said yes it is because uh you are not really not saying that to to this brother possessed brother a demon was saying that they are possessed we possess them we possess them because the pastor they don't take the word he will tell you one day a demon say possess them because the pastor tells them of the fourth dimension to check what they are doing they don't listen that's why we possess them through that Dimension di coming through what they say screening it appears on the screen all right amen now but brother Bram says if you pass the four dimension and they go higher higher you meet Jesus amen amen but if you come and stop there at the fourth di sat so you must go further he says then you need Jesus let us look at this before we don't worry me and my pastor we are going to talk we want to make sure that finish we will finish the work brother I had I don't know all right amen God bless amen okay amen we still have some few minutes amen let's use this few minutes okay amen we actually we are coming to something that will also help me now today the disciples they some one day they asked the lord of the end time side and he said to them uh it shall be like in the days of Amen during the time of you you know it you've watched it you know it was fire Noah during the time of Noah it was flat now have you not seen those things amen it's happening they are there happening today and Nation against Nation can you see those things amen because I was talking to a sister back that comes from God comes through a prophecy why when he was born predestinated it did not surprise the predestinated ones because God's Prophet spoke and said behold behold a child yes amen a church did he say a church a vision shall conceive a vision shall conceive amen amen amen then he says a son son is given a son is given he's born unto us amen we have has been born unto us then that's when that prophecy was fulfill this people they are not [Music] drunk they are not drunk by wine it is what the Propet Church Prophet fulfillment of a prophet it's based on the it doesn't work by saying someone say there was a brother like this it goes by prophecy the Fulfillment it is that's why fulfillment of Prophecy it tells us that there's no more time amen the signs we see we recognize them and we look back and say the Lord Jesus spoke of this when you shall see at that time of the of the flats there's something that happened there that was new [Music] and but did you see what happened that Noah said to Lord men let's separate why the Bible says Lord Abraham so each of them had his am you see the that CA the Bible say Abraham had livestock and Trel comes to church like that now what happened there uh if the pastor comes God has given him the word and I take while the pastor is preaching oh I didn't know about this I put it down like this amen amen now I leave I go to place the ones that have not heard the pastor when I got there I said bre now having B God spoke to me you're lying you heard the pastor preaching just say I thank God of my pastor amen amen amen I did know now when he I found this and then I want to share that with you it came through my [Applause] [Music] pastor yeah now he says I thank God by his grace I was there bowing down there then he came down and spoke to me all right I I I I'm trying to it is like my mother told me of something the two now both they had a problem Oh call it sa just say one of the two girls it says and the other one says all of them they are missing it and they it became a big fight and this one was say no no it's that is what is happening today and so forth if Moses God told Moses to use that Rod again you see what happened because it is God who told Moses then he called the Bible calls it the road of God it doesn't say the RO of no the of Amen then if he comes to the Sea and SM Thea and the Sea open amen there was another man I've got the book at he he also came I can't say that he had a stick amen amen they had to cross the the river there were lot of ring that time now he came also he say just like Moses as he Smite the waters I have my stick here amen amen then he Smite the Watchers will The Watcher depart no it is not God who said that now now after his might there they just say a little bit now he just went in [Applause] there now they had to search and look for him with a boat Moses used a stick given to him by God God blessed that called the road of Moses the road of God God Amen Let me close with this until we we we we we we come and finish it up I was I was here actually at the the beginning of the new commission will even come to a place the prophet says he was no longer [Music] a a what a mediator a mediator when there seals the seven seal no amen uh we'll come we'll read it out of the that is the word of God when the seventh was open he is of all the other seals he says and when it was revealed Revelation 8 it says speaks of the which but it says it speaks of the opening because all the seals under the seven amen amen now H for God to open unto us there all all the seals because all all this time he kept on saying they are not revealed they are not re amen amen he mentioned only the six because the sixes and but the seven hallu now while passing there the six Moses elah amen amen and what about Moses and Elijah because it's a seal to the Jews all right am and you know about Transfiguration when they appeared in their we are still and then one of them that was Moses amen amen now the book says this Elijah to the Jews was an Elijah of did you hear him talking about it of the Gentile am amen amen but this one then he comes and say let's follow standing in the Gap the Gap amen amen we haven't yet come to the White Stone come I don't have a problem I've got a pastor amen amen right the Elijah Spirit of from the it can be a different man the spirit is of amen amen amen now we realize that this Elijah Moses and Elijah that was that is for the Jews it is coming we know about we see what is happening in Jerusalem is happening with the Jews all the we are looking at what is happening with Russia all this you know the real church is based on the revealed and fulfilled prophecy is that right you read the newspapers and some people just read the newspaper but they the prde of Christ they know because these things the spoke said when you shall see this when you shall see the flood are we not seeing the FL all right some see them but they say is what climate clate church today is not a fulfillment to them amen to us is the Fulfillment the you see the difference if they see these things they say climate church we say What the Lord Has that's the difference but those of the wisdom of the world call it climate change those who have received it from God you know that is a prophecy the Lord Jesus has spoken is that right now you take Abraham abah and Lord Abraham Abraham was uh of the promises of God lord was just an person now the Bible says Lord had his own use that word substance substance and Abraham now when the time arrived Abraham said Lord will do this because the the Shepherds of Abraham and Lord they were against one another now he said now you watch Abraham said now if you take this way I will take this then he say Tru Abraham knew that Lord will never choose the right place because the only person who to choose the right place is the person that God spoke to he said now the Bible says he started now to look around then he was attracted when he saw Sodom and showed to his friend to say amen amen think amen what do you think of look at those fields we can build they say amen amen then the Bible says now Lord Lord chose before it was Destro can you hear he chose before it was destroyed amen amen because his choice was not the choice that was not I mean was not of God but before even now I'm closing but you have to make your choice before this world is judged let me we are still coming with that the signs that are here what are they saying to you I realiz that the people don't see this am amen just like Lord that's why Abraham the Bible says Abraham early in the morning he woke up and walked to the place where he stood before maybe we are not getting something God spoke to Abraham about what was coming and when that prophecy was about to be fulfilled the Bible says early in the morning he went where he stood before the Lord that's how the word comes to us he puts us we stood where we stood with him he take us back to that position there reason why the Bible says early in the morning he walked where he stood before the Lord why because it was by Revelation that he should come to the place and look from that place as even he told him back there he said look when he he he was looking look from this place amen amen you know why I'm here with you while we are here he has placed us in a place where we can see all those things you know before God can deal with you he has to put you in the right [Applause] place all right amen where the right place the message will be the right message [Music] you will meet with the right people that's why he said early in the morning now he knew that his binoc is Jesus Is God amen amen what do you call the one you use for telescope telescope telescope amen telescope you see look far away now Abraham was his telesc that's why as maybe that night he was thinking of the things that God has told him but Revelation in the morning took him to that place before God can show you he has to put you on the right place before you can see these things God has to put you in the right place first before you can see the right place you should worship under the right p a pastor who is under the guidance of God amen amen before you start worshiping you must find the right place God don't just speak amen amen that's why Abraham knew that for me now to see the Fulfillment I've got to find the right [Music] because we will come to that where brother says the seventh was [Music] opened we have back in Genesis back in Genesis now the people who can see the opening of The Seven it says that that Revelation is from that's why he say you have seen from your now your theop was in the mind of God back there when he started to set up things watching that's why today he you have heard now if youve somebody comes and say the this this it's not a problem amen God has given it to you before am all right amen so when it is open it is open to those who have heard [Applause] it okay they are not looking for it because uh if God has given you something you don't go around looking for amen am because already was told told when the time comes then she go she went around I knowah how do you know because the Bishops in the church the prophets they don't know [Music] abouts I know am one says hey I read in the Bible here this this will happen but the other one comes and say I know meaning that she has heard from her amen she was not waiting for somebody and say it Abraham knew for me to see that I must go to him and from that position to know about so he woke up in the morning to go to the right place and from that place you saw now you must find the right place before you can see you got to get to know the right find the right place then from there you will see that's why we can see Sodom what is now happening it must be from the right place that's why he said look from the look from here that you see shall be gred look you know that scripture brother you know the scripture all right amen you hear the scripture amen then then I'm closing here I'm going to talk to my pastor we we will come for the me and the past amen what it says Genesis 13:14 yes and the Lord said unto Abraham after that Lord was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art Eastward and Southward and Eastward and Westward amen for all the land which thou seest to thee will I grant it and to thy seed forever amen am amen hallelujah which L the L that you know I because there something that I have seen amen because something can shine just now oh it's like when they open a new denomination I can take you by emotions and then and you think that you're not predestinated if you are not predestinated oh actually if you're not predestinated be taken up amen am but the Bible says look from thou amen there must be a place now let us go and find out if whether we are in the right place when he looked from that place he saw what did he that's right amen and for himself God showed him the pr our God is so fair with his a [Music] subjects a true worshiper don't just worship singing and dancing he knows where he is a true worshiper will never worship until he's in the place of of worship true worship knows when when he is right with God or not that's why we found so many prayer lines today you find the people who still hate a person who hates his brother amen we can differ but hatred is of [Applause] theil but we can don't but now the people hate one another and they believe that they are Christians amen that's a Christian but if there's still that nature in says that is the nature of God bless you amen uh pray for me also I have just said this I I I spoke a lot of things here the white stone new commission amen amen then I'm going to to speak to my pastor then we will come and continue with these things that we have mentioned quite must talk about what about the white St to the end but I think God wanted us to take it this way [Music] amen AS stand [Music] up he love me and [Applause] Chas on Brethren amen you know God sometimes I seen in the Bible sometimes the place is here but God takes you this way that is the mind of God Amen even now that's why say I speak to my pastor because God took us this way and we will come to the White Stone and the other things here God wants us to maybe some some people are still coming where is brother hey I was listening was leading and was so blessed just before we I leave the place for our pastor one of
