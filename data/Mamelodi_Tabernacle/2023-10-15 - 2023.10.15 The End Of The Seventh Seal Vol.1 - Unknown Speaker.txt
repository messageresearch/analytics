Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal 
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-October 15 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Rev 8: 1  Rev 12:12
The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the end of The Seventh Seal.
Every man wants to know his origin. You can worship in spirit and truth after my origin is revealed. We as the son and daughters of Salem we are working for our home in Salem.
Put off the old man and his deeds and put on the new man. The new man comes with the new faith the new virtue. The old man can't keep the faith.
A person who can't hear the word of God is of a strange nature. If you are a Christian you can be traced back to your theophany and back to God where came from.
God has send seven messengers, and a true believer will check if his worship falls within the seven messengers. But the Bride of Christ is no longer in the pyramid of stones but she is in the pyramid of Angels. God can only serve you if you are moving together with the program.
The messenger had to go west to connect with the angels' message. If God changed his messenger, he must also change the audience. 
The Pastor Read the following quotations:

64-0802 The Future Home Par 205
63-0623M Standing In The Gap Par 82
62-1230E Is This The Sign Of The End Sir?  Par 207
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 78, 231, 233.

The interpretation of the seventh seal comes by the angels from eternity.

the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour uh do we have vacular amen amen you may be seated God bless you all right our subject is still the end [Music] time okay amen amen when it is broken and it is revealed it shows things that were in his mind it opens up the revelation of the Revelation amen it takes you back amen amen you know every man wants to know his [Music] origin amen amen I can worship in spirit and Truth after my origin is revealed to me I I I know it is impossible for me to go back to sin because our Salvation was dealt with before there was sin amen sin has found us amen being his being the and that's why uh even this morning it is impossible for a predestinated man or woman amen it is very very impossible amen amen if such a person could fall then the people would look at God and say you have failed if God the Lord Jesus is eternal then how about the [Music] subject amen that's why king of Salem H God considered this King because he has ordained this king king of of Salem that's why we always I love to ju you as the citizens D and the Bible says our citizenship is in In Heaven There are some people coming from some other countries and they will tell I just work for my home amen I I work only for my home so we uh sons and citizens Daughters of for home this world is not my home amen amen uh you know once a person can realize that this is not my hope then he start working towards his I tried say in the house of the in the Royal house then when I realize the people H don't sing with me me that song and [Music] s [Music] Amen to [Music] me people our home is far away now I was in so one time and uh I don't know we were there for something visiting there and there were people uh they drew a a big crowd of people around them with their music so I walk there from the house I was visiting then foreign language I heard them singing in a foreign language and but there were some women around then I ask one who are these people because their music is unique amen and then he told me are not from I said that's why I understand amen amen they are not from now they are singing songs from their country amen just like when we are singing what is our saying even so come Lord Jesus healing power comes from the blood until then until then and so forth no amen others they don't know them they don't sing this we are foreigners enous now the life that we live another cannot live this life but the citizens of Salem they sing this songs I am not surprised when others are not seeing it that's when I remember that in I heard the foreigners singing yes amen that's why now some we can rather go and buy some recordings out there but he can't sing healing power com from the blood you see amen now you can identify that's this one is a for amen amen okay amen h of all the seals of which [Music] SE me I know them all just say it and then you just ask him how do you know them he says no there a White Horse and you only know the the seven [Music] se you only know about horses okay now we are affected not withes no amen the seventh SE of which now that's why let me look first here um I don't know if this future home will correspond with my do you have different all right let read you might say this to me page 27 I just feel somebody might say this to me brother Bram brother what are you going to do now you have run out of your complete servant you know we we don't just run amen amen we have a message with distances so that we can communicate every now he says uh what he says brother bam what are you going to do now you have run out of your complete [Music] servants the owner of this book has indicated here that he has a gone through this amen you are going to like you this morning where are you going amen you know uh the most miserable person it's a person who doesn't know where he or she is coming from where he's going amen am you know we were in the world that's why we used to take some things drinks and smoke things and we didn't know where we were going now long suffering has no peace has no [Music] joy he prefers to get drunk when you ask him why he says I just want to forget the problems of the world he can bring till he actually FS I just want to forget everything I have problems children are drinking and all you know so that's why I will take something just in trying to forget but you can't forget nature all right all right let let me read this what are you going to do now brother bam you have run out of your complete servant why are you going to do now after you have [Music] run completed your Serv what are you going to do now that's the question today we are here we are in the service but it will leave me again it uh with not a question but a thought that Lord where to now amen you know you need to make God your friend so that you can inquire you know uh they talk about inquiry inquir okay amen we have one you know there a there's a fly here the owner of it doesn't love this it's not the first time if you love it retrieve amen I'll tell you something you know we as a child of God uh you know we we used to [Music] sing uh I'm in the bus in the bus of God amen amen say it how it starts you desp us oh you may despise us in the bus in the bus of God amen amen somebody who is in business buiness I remember I used to work for the account accountant every time even uh there were two managers the first thing as they enter the office there's a a body there I don't know what do you call that notice okay that's the first one you see yes for today's program where do I start today before he sits down he must look at the program then as no after sitting bring me that file that's when he says can I have that file amen amen but after he has look at the of the day all right amen now that's why we also as the children of God uh we have our inner program do I go from here like they say where do I go uh from here you know if you can have that program where do I go from here amen amen then I read oh where are you going brother B where brother B where are you going to do now after you are uh a dispensationalist he say so you are then brother says which I am I believe that God is too is a dispensation amen amen you run out of a dispensation dispensation dispensation for if you are going to do something beyond that seven now how are you going to get it where are you going now amen all right amen uh even now well you see the the things that are happening in the world have you seen them have you seen the flats have you seen what is going on exactly what he has said You shall see floods Nation against Nation amen amen uh hey let me stop there are so many unfolding now it is now the end all right amen you are banking I am banking but not for the future because I don't have any future here mhm this banking appears to be a problem where are you going to do now after s your s and then saw that's why he says you are a dispensationalist which I am says brother BR I believe that God is too you've run out of your dispensation [Music] types if you are going to put something beyond that seven actually it says beyond that seventh day how are you going to get it where are you going to now now the man of God says if you put something beyond that seven if you hit seven then where are you going that's why we have the revelation of the seventh SE amen amen then I'll check for you here uh what he says of this things all right the question stands because he says uh seven deals with the that H was alloted to if now you sp you take seven it says it speaks of the old creation but eight speaks of the new creation you know we have old creation and the new creation that's why the Bible now says to you about the old creation take off take of whom the old man and put on the new man he doesn't say paint the old man or renovate the old man no take and put because the new one comes with its Faith VES everything is new the faith the virtues but the old one you cannot have faith in that old man there's a body that can contain Faith but the old body can't keep Faith amen amen all right when the people maybe after they got some money now they want to renovate their house extend pain did you notice that they also want to change the furniture as God said I make all things he can't give you an old body and put the new furniture in there the new man comes with the new man the old man you can pray and do whatever you do but long the nature is still that one you are going nowhere what must be changed is the nature that's why Peter says he has given us divine nature amen now divine nature uh people are known in this way you can you can be happy with him but be careful now there's somewhere where something not okay when okay but if he can get angry be careful all right the nature of a person it's like I'm tying it's like a person when she is a [Music] witch you've never heard me say so and so is a witch you know this person he can't even sleep he's busy busy in the business in bu but he is not striving to do a good thing he's not striving to go to heaven but he's busy man when the Sun goes down he's already busy with his broom amen amen because you see now he can come and sit here when you preach he doesn't hear you he is of another nature a person who can hear the word of God is of a strange nature because the B says children have you even seen uh When the Children don't listen to him even if he is even if he the parent is a drun amen amen when the children are not goinging even when he's say my children come here he wants to discipline them and give them order amen even though he cannot stand thing in him is a parent now now he is practicing for his children to do things in order but today's children cell phone they are friends with cell phone okay now let's cross this after seven I now and where are you going now let us pick up some things here from the book firstly I will read to you this the blood test blood test amen amen there's things like this uh sometimes you take anybody be be it a child or a an elder psychologist or psychist you know these ones they work in this they operate they operate in this way if you say this child is doing this and this and that well others they just give them pill amen amen if you say this child amen amen respect no respect they say no no we do give him this headache once but psych you go to a psychiatrist he traces back amen amen so he traces for back there is there no one in the family who was doing this you can say yes the aunt or the uncle was doing this that's the problem [Music] says it comes from there you see amen that's why now if you are a Christian you are you can only be traced back to your the back to God where you came from that's why you are like your father you are doing the same thing because God is your father now you are like your father you Shan everything that is of the world to take his word because his word shall be forever now let me look at this H I'm going to read some few things before uh we can say we have worship okay our day there was this part of seven now after those seven we have read if if I've got the book here otherwise I will just quote you know says is this the time after the seven angels as we I mean seven Messengers and uh brother call them the Earthly Angels because they are Seven Stars mhm M amen now a true worshiper would check that his worship within this seven does it fall under this seven or not if God has given us seven angels we were looking at the one inside there with the brothers the notable Angel which has confused many people right am now I want to look at this the seventh seal the reason they say it is not revealed you'll see it here in the book and yet the seventh when is it going to be revealed if it is not revealed then where are you going okay and again the thing is confusion comes in this way was seven Messengers amen Amen brother B will tell you and we have seven angels from Paul say from eternity now you come from this seven then comes this now you can take seven Messengers amen but it's not complete because after seven there is seven everything comes with the natural the supernatural uh let me find this sometimes uh uh sometimes I I look for some things M all right unless you give me says is this the time page 26 then I will read you something out of there but otherwise while the brother has it he will bring it page 27 I didn't know I would come this way but this page 27 uh 26 26 26 it tells you the prophet was looking right into eternity as he said says you know you don't you won't go to the New Jerusalem unless you have seen it I'll tell you something everything comes like this before you see something uh you've got to see it it comes in forms different form we have Jerusalem and we have the New Jerusalem but we will we are going there to where Moses and [Music] Elijah will come to Jerusalem and the time of the Gentiles when it is finished and it is will come to that what's next on the program is for Moses and Elijah is the [Music] rapture the church should be ruptured no force can stop that amen amen it will be ruptured very soon then after that according to his word Moses and Elijah they will come to to the Jews which is the Sixth Seal The Sixth Seal is Moses and Elijah it was opened there and they are coming to Jerusalem that's why the prophet of God says the six is the Tribulation seal because it brings Moses and Elijah to Jerusalem Jerusalem amen brothera they are dead brothera no they were seen on M Transfiguration in their the now that's why you see it's shaking now we I'm following the events in Jerusalem right amen instead of checking on the television how and Dollar on the television how the dollar and the performs performs yeah there are people every morning they check if they buy papers he wants to know how performs R and yeah dollar R dollar shall pass away did you hear the message Heaven and Earth shall pass away and he says behold I create new heaven I make new Heaven and if you are told that this will pass away you start to work for the one that is coming in if the seven this seven will pass away then the Sons and Daughters of God are looking at the next seven because this seven is meain but the next seven is the angels from eternity amen is that right now I read here if if you knew what eternity is do you know what is all right I can prepare for future do we have future in this world which one if you have one which one because you can't sell that to a Christian a Christian knows that the future is God himself so he serves or she serves God knowing that that's where she or he is going okay now let me read this uh there are angels you know there Seven Stars and we have angels from Heaven because before we touch I ask for S is this the time now it says H this seven Earthly angels for the for the seven church [Music] agels that's for the ages but then the bride of Christ now she is no longer there amen she is in this seven which is a pyramid of angels now you watch this pyramid you have the pyramids of stone and you have the Pyramid of angels amen okay amen the very same Prophet was introduced to the pyramid where he was put the pyramid in that constellation but we realize then after that it was another servant which is now a pyramid of angels he was put also in that pyramid now he can save you only if you are moving together with the program okay amen seven Church do we have seven churches no they have passed away now it's seven angels I can read just one small part the Angels lowered themselves from Heaven standing in the G page 21 to bring the message so you only know the message of this seven Messengers amen amen but the message don't end there you go further now it says uh page 21 standing in the Gap the Angels lower themselves from Heaven to bring the message amen now he says these ones they came from eternity Eastward Eastward East West as Adam the prophet of God says I had to go Eastward in Eden the the Garden of Eden was put what now if brother Bram says I went West where if there East and Men was placed East now there was West now to meet the angel he to go west so that's why after brother Bram says east and west all right amen placed East he had to go to w to meet with the Angel's [Music] message West after that he returned East because man was pleased East with the Angel's message he met he met that angel then he came back if now this Prophet as an angel he had to go for the message for opening of the seventh seal she had to meet an angel not a messeng now an angel from eternity right then if you come with an angel's message uh where will you preach that message unless you meet the same type if God changed his H messenger he must change the audience amen what if the messenger is changed but the audience is not changed because this thing has to go together amen that's why he says this part the Angels lower themselves but I find it here also it is in this is this the I don't know if uh the pages are the same says watching Eastward and right and I'm I'm trying to locate all right it's this one doesn't correspond with let me reach from here because I'm looking at the one talking about the new the new amen amen all right but it should let me try here but it shook the read from here and when he did I was still looking Westward [Music] you know you go back there that's East West man is pleased West but to meet the angel he speaks of he was placed East all right am I I believe is is it still the same yes quotation yes okay I could see those angels i p i i c coming he saw angels He says from amen amen so now I just this seven Messengers MERS but from there is the [Music] angels I read I could see those angels those shaped back Wings traveling faster than sound travel you know if you can see something that is traveling faster than that that means you are in that or you say constellation they come from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eyes not enough to bet your eyes just a twinkle they were there I didn't have time to count you see you are talking about being whisked away in the twinkling of an [Music] eye even Satan will wonder because that is in a twinkling those people are no more amen you can even find him I don't know what happened to those people now sometimes you say really he's actually trou than you and when he is or he wrongs me tell you what is it that that so [Music] much I say Revelation chapter 12 and you watch what is it that makes him to do this Revelation chapter 12:2 therefore Rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them right uh let me repeat this there he's talking to those who are they the raptured those who were already in heaven okay amen therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them amen wo to the Inhibitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he but a short time right amen what makes him like that he knows something short time what makes the Sons and Daughters of God to act it is because they know they've got eternal life amen amen amen that is the thing that pulls them that Eternal Force amen amen they they they they they as Paul says let us run the race they are running a race because they know where they are going a person who knows where he is going will sh did you know that I'll tell you something uh if a person is predestinated he comes to church just to shout amen hallelujah glory to Jesus he is a pilgrim this world is not or their home when he or she comes she comes to L God because she's on the way to the promised [Music] land you tell yeah you see me my husband then I will say but who has promised you who do you worship your husband or or the one who promised you because he's more than my husband he's greater more than my wife that's why job said you speak like fo when the wife said ciss this God and die and she said watch your mouth only a fool can say that I I read yeah this the first is seven Messengers for the seven Church ages but now we are no longer in that con the bride is now in another conell that makes the difference and the language of those in that conation from the language of these that are in the angels conation amen amen they are not speaking the same if you meet somebody in the in this we are coming to that the Pyramid of angels now if you find somebody from the Pyramid of in the Pyramid of the Ang you'll realize that Ministry is not like the one who is still in that P because that is [Music] ages but this one it's a pyramid of angels coming from eternity now the prophet says and they put him in that pyramid we are we are coming to where you'll see where it says they put me in the Pyramid of themselves are you aware of that if now the prophet is in the Pyramid of angels you are claiming to be the follower amen amen can you correspond the the the the prophet is in the Angels PID and can you remain in another pyramid but we'll come to that we'll look at it what we are talking about amen am another Ministry amen amen and you'll see down there you we are going to that white stone only are starting here we come to that white stone that was within the pyramid and the Angels Came to interpret now the interpretation of the seven seal amen is the interpretation by the angels and you'll see the reason why people say it is not revealed we'll find it here okay amen now do you know of this pyramids we have the pyramid here and it's Earthly is The Messengers Messengers all right then after we have run through that [Music] seven no there's another pyramid now if you remain in with that one that's why you say the seventh is not re now you will realize when we come to these books that the seventh is Reve but then that will be the ministry coming from the new pyramid I mean the p PID of amen and you listen to the message of the Prophet when he is now in the Pyramid [Music] of you see now in the Pyramid of angels He cannot speak to natural men if it is of the Angels it has to do with my theop amen all right amen tell me if I talk about the seven SE it's not like a student have you seen a student when things are tough he uses the pen to crack said amen amen then you realize that in you there is nothing impossible because ours is not education it is spiritual now if it is spiritual nothing impossible because it's not you it is him says no i' brought you to I forgot to yeah to tell brother about this no no amen you are part of him amen when he was a a spirit you were a spirit and Prophet says then he was the word you know you are coming together with the threefold of which he tells you that this seal is not revealed to the [Music] public you see that we going back to that threefold not the public because it doesn't it is not sent to the head but it is a revelation okay am now the thing is we are going to look at the Pyramid of angels we had Paul elah the prophet now we are coming to the angel I read here uh it says as he was looking deep into eternity he saw this sign Angels coming amen you are right brother B we are witnesses to that he saw this Angels coming and the prophet stood there seeing those angels then God said these are the seven angels coming to give you your new commission amen now that's why the bride is under the new Commission Now the new commission is of the Pyramid of [Music] angels amen the new commission commission amen amen that's where you find the seventh seal because the white stone was in theid this pyramid of Angels the white stone we will come to the White Stone you know I was in Malawi and looking at the we came we were walking alongside uh the lake when I we came to some big boulders then I was looking at one I said to the brother who was with me [Music] H amen well we were brothers but there was this one walking close close to I said you see this St uh it carries history history amen well I'm not saying America went to the moon or what there's disputes on this thing so for but what I'm want to say when one of the astronauts they required from him about because coming back they say I'm not saying to you they went to the moon I want to type to you something on their return there this H they came with a stone they they call that stone gen Genesis stone stone amen amen why because a stone carries history the stone has some [Music] layers if you go science they will tell you that this stone is so so so years old how do you know scientist I have uh studied the layers in the stone that's why they call him Rock of Ages because he said Upon This Rock I will build my church so the layers in the Rock it's of Ages amen now that's why seven Church ages when he said of the church he said I will build my church Upon This Rock and the Gates of Hell shall never never Prevail over it Hallelujah all right amen that's him the Eternal one somebody was saying can men kill God now they look at the Lord Jesus Christ and they see a man who suffered and they was even crucified so they can't accept him because to them he a man who came he ate he suffered and so forth that's how they present him to themselves in that form okay but the Insiders they knew that in Jesus was life a life that could not die when they kill they killed the flesh but not him because he said destroy this Temple he never said destroy me destroy this Temple he was referring to the body and I will raise it up in and in the on the third day it happened he came into that body again and they call it Resurrection he came back now you see we are waiting for him we'll meet him in the air we shall change in a twinkling of an eye oh I'm waiting for that moment when we shall change that's why we say goodbye [Music] world the things of the world if you are a citizen okay amen we are we are not yet here but we are going today we were laying here sort of a foundation then we'll come there after that I will ask whether the seventh was revealed to you or [Music] not like this part all the way back from Genesis this seventh SE is spoken of from the very beginning of Genesis you see this seventh seal now how can you know this seventh seal uh it is revealed to a being that was [Music] there Revelation actually that's why we say the as he when he opened the seven it was silent in heaven amen amen amen not when he preached that's why people have lost it because they are waiting for the preaching of the seventh but it never said he will preach the seven but it says he will open [Music] it when he opened H amen amen what is revelation Revelation I'm not talking about preaching we are talking about re what God reveals to you now that's why you can preach revelation and say I preached Revelation now they have received Revelation no we'll come to that that's why the the seals you can't preach the seventh seal and especially it was opened by whom amen when he opened it was Sil where and the prophet says they were all by it in heaven they were looking at that that's what we'll come to where the Bible says what is men amen amen he opened you know this body is the body of Flesh if you want to put something in my Souls you've got to open all right amen which is like this if a preacher preaches we are listening like if you ask somebody what is the title I heard him say something like that means you are not there amen amen now if you were not there you heard him saying something like that M amen but it was not open you were not there saying the preacher saying we going to talk about the works of the works of the spirit you didn't hear him is that right amen did you know that many a Time the people don't know the tile you can say it but they didn't hear it okay I'll tell you something why I say this now all the way from not from the first church no from amen this seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis the
