TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I've seen it happening in the church there sorry if you have a question then you'll come to the service you realize the pastor will answer that okay um I've seen it happening many a time I've seen it happening assistant brother would come to me Pastor I had a problem with this and this and this pastor episode now when you're preaching this morning I have received the answer then I said I say brother Brendan says the other part of the trans God contracts contract yeah that's that's why we have pastors here yeah part of the contract is then if he loses the contract the whole church will lose the contract [Music] because as a pastor Joseph you are a Shepherd contracted you are receiving from God yes you respect your pastor here I will encourage you to respect your pasta because he is the shepherd here foreign okay let us read why the people say the seventh is not revealed and ask when will it be revered because the days are coming are going um and uh is the rapture coming to find us still waiting for their servants to be revealed is look at it why [Applause] all right Hallelujah I asked a brother when is it going to be revealed because since I received the message Nini until today they are quiet about it now I read out here Tanga says now I want you to notice tonight in The Sixth Seal Kachina bilimbo there was a three peoples in the sixth sale Katina six so page five seven three foreign [Music] it is also a threefold mystery now if you say that the servant is not revealed that means you have reduced reduced it to a twofold is now you'll remain with two forms which the number of life is the number of life foreign that's when we are still looking for life amen and the Perfection two is not the number of perfection that's why it says it is revealed in a free food and we were looking at the threefolds that in the book of uh uh uh Genesis puts it as God and logos and the men and the men yeah Moto okay okay that's why he says you know when he came to the Jews he said to them I and my father are one he never mentioned the third at that time I and my father but when the gentle Church comes in because amen because three is the number of Perfections amen amen the Third without the third because the third is a complete now listen to this year do you notice do you noticeable yeah on the opening of the seventh seal natango is also in a three-fold mystery amen it can be in there too and it is not opened now he says on the opening of the seventh seal it's also in a three-fold now the threefold if I go back to Genesis it is a a threefold in this manner God the logos that's how he puts it but men got lost and when he came to Israel Israel he spoke of the twofold of it yeah because men being the partner of the contract was out but after the Pentecostal blessing because then they went back to Father Son and Holy Ghost they started to count three again but before that he said to the Jews I and my father Tata is now let me read something here let brother Brennan put it to us Christ is the mystery of God revealed Crystal Christian I've got this book here looking let's start with the church let's start with the changes he Reveals His change because the church is a revealed the bride is the revealed Church where the Mercedes the money Sami is not just a church and raising it up by the same weight it is part of his threefold is do we believe that escape episode and logos logos then the man the bride is not made of the readers foreign sorry the battle that was fought you know we have the battle of Armageddon I mean Beyond time he says it was fought Beyond time and it will be finished Beyond Time that's right okay and with the seals also were there Beyond time they were revealed Beyond Time their time had not yet arrived because the third one was not yet there the third one yes God is completed he is perfect in three zombies but you are part of the third pool of the threefold now I will I will close by saying this uh remember [Music] he opened the seals and stopped at their seats and that's why they say it is not revealed when he was coming in his um uh creation somewhere and stopped uh and the man who resembled him after he created every time he gives a revelation [Music] let me read it again here let me just take this part at that day Christ is the mystery of God revealed catching at Crystal which day when the Revelation is made known the Revelation the revelation of God is made known in a freefold as this as I have read then that is also in a three-fold if we are not part of the threefold would come with a different Ministry [Music] but we are part of the threefold foreign that's why we preach what he preaches amen he doesn't even wait for the pastor to read the first brother Brennan did not receive Revelation by reading foreign God has already put in him you too the thing that I do yes God wouldn't do a thing without Abraham knowing because the Bible says Jesus himself is the Seed of Abraham yes you look at the Lord and Abraham one was Lord one was the Bible says why it says because Lord has his and Abraham had his Lord has okay yes and all that each and every one of them had his own amen like in the church here if we I start to have my own Revelation and I'm a sheep that would mean the Pastor has a revelation to feed the sheep and the Sheep also has their own Revelation Revelation yeah [Applause] that was the problem with lots the rest will see amen the servants is revealed is ATO [Music] will continue me a new brother but listen to this Jesus said yes do we know now [Applause] but I believe that there's a day when we can testify that now we know amen [Applause] in the denomination and the minister will say then open the book amen foreign that is open the book and what is [Music] now uh okay and water okay but when I arrived here in the message foreign the books were opened and there was there's one called The Book of Life says are the books of sinners those were accustomed to the Lake of Fire but those in in the book of life will be judged according to their works but the bride is not in that in those books book of life in the Lamb's Book of Life going to judgment you are not going to stand before the judge foreign [Applause] [Music] it is here in the Bible [Music] we should know who we are [Applause] and we should know where we are going we should know where we are going this is we should know where we come from we should know who we are Nani so we are part of the threefold revelation of God we will see this other part tokomona eternity the Lord willing to more if there will be a tomorrow [Applause] [Music] before we close the book he says Jesus said yes then are you listening closely brother then he says this day at that time it was that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the uh I am in the father and the father in me and I in you revelation of God that's why even the seventh seal yeah it is only known to those that are part of the threefold ah is [Applause] because pretty it was God it was God it is then the man dropped off the falling away of the man caused the blood of God [Applause] to bring the men back again because [Applause] ready to go [Music]
