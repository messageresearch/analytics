Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation vol.3
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 03 March 2024.

Text:The pyramid of the white rock

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17
Ephesians 4:30
The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the White stone interpretation.

When the name is in the stone, it means it has always been there. The people that you can talk to them about the Rapture are the people who are in the Rapture. When something is quoted and If your life, your beliefs is in that thing you wont believe it. But the person who is not in that thing he will believe it. 
When the door is closed, those who are filthy will continue to be filthy. If you continue to do something you are a prisoner of it. 

When you are going into the rapture it is easy to recognise the person who is also  going. 

Satan doesn’t know what love is, he who hate his brother or sister is like Cain. 

The white Stone is given to the overcomers. The new commission was of the Angels.

The new name is only known by the owner not by any other person. What is revealed in you is the new name. 
When the prophet started going westward, others got lost in the process. 

A true believer this morning is somebody who can open the heart for Him to come inside.
A doer of the word is a person with the nature of God. It is only God who has changed our nature for divine nature. Divine Nature is not your nature it is God nature in you. You can’t live without this nature. You don’t need any other church , you need him. The nature in you will always put you where you belong . If it is the nature of God it will put you in God. If it is the nature of the world it will put you in the things of the world. And the things of the world will pass away. 


The original church is called the bride. God through predestination comes and fulfils his Word in you.
If there is no restoration it means the Lord has failed. What God redeems it is something that was in his...

says brother blessed would you please ask Pastor gima a question for me in junior Jackson's dream brother bham told the people to look in that mountain on the White Rock but many left some remained to L and asbr Goda spoke of how they saw their own reflection in them in Revelation 2:1 17 the pagamos church 8 it speaks of being given a white stone with a new name written which only he that receiv received knows that he does he see a connection between these two it has to be a revelation to see the name on The Stone as only he that receives it knows it amen hallelujah amen that's brother gabri brother gab we are going to read his scripture to continue and uh given a white stone with a new [Music] name written which only he that receives it receives knows amen meaning that when that time then each and every one of us has seen his name the name [Music] only only amen amen okay amen but now okay amen uh we'll bow our heads and hey how are you young up there yeah how is is it up there okay don't move away remain there invite the others of your age there is a place up up there [Music] amen where the righteous The Young Ones amen Amen brother just say a prayer for we going to read just for reading the word of God Amen here your scure behold God is with man Baba that Tabernacle is with us today deliver the white stone that white stone is in our hearts each and every year spiritual May shut down all open the channel of Heaven everybody who is here to connect with you so father God that joy since the singing of this morning were bubbling in our heart to continue bubbling am you may be going to reading Revelation 2 verse 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the Spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden Manner and will give him a white stone amen and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen God blesses he that overc he that overcometh oh he that overcome yes all right amen continue he that overcome he that to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen okay amen amen you hear speak in it it doesn't say onone the stone but it says in the St amen okay it means that this name amen has always been there because because all right amen uh I don't know Rapture they saying that Rapture they actually saying it is happening this year now I haven't mentioned anyone talking about this met amen amen you know the reason why yeah let's because as it says in the stone okay amen now Rapture Le is like a a rock a stone no the people that you can talk to about the rapt it is the people that are in the Rapture amen all right amen so we thank [Music] God we are going helping us amen that when you come then you will be here because it's not because we will be fast we sleep early in the morning and wake up still early amen amen so this Stone we are going back to the stone as our precious brother gabri requested so we are together we are together now I just want to quote a few things just to keep time and the white stone interpretation then so many things to come with this Stone there's many things that's why my brother was concerned let's look at the stone because because if your name is in the Rock and then and you read it in the Bible you must be concerned they were singing and they were saying and mine is there my name is there my name is there so we realize that the only message you can actually believe theity message there's there's a certain message that majority don't believe it amen amen like instam when I talk about Instagram don't believe it why but those those whose names are not found in there something when we Cote something if your life your belief but the person who is not in that thing he's the only one that will believe it is that right amen now that's why when the Bible says let him that is filthy do you know the scure it is read that scripture because because this is the time we are living in I heard the prophet when he was quoting it the one who is what he is let him continue that way amen it means that it's a point of no return you can't change him you can't change him Revelation 2 verse 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still amen did you hear the prophet when he talks about this this scripture Sor yes yes all right sorry okay sir 11 11 11 says did you hear it it says actually in everyone's heart he says I I'm continue the way right amen have you heard the prophet talking about that's when the door is [Music] closed it means that there is no more it's closed amen with our brother here let's look here together with our brother is this the time this the time because every recording or every is a special name it is actually imprinted on a Stone like the message the seals like the message of the seals message specially if you say this the seventh Seal white stone it is imprinted on a white stone amen so Mal one time we were talking in Malawi one time [Music] closer to the lake okay we getting we walking Closer by the lake and then now there's big rocks there now I ask brother now I said now this rocks by the time the Lord Jesus Christ was preaching here on Earth were they always there the brother said when Wasing were there he said yes am showing Jesus as The Rock Amen of for me let me hide not in a new rock no there this one of Ages because if I hide myself in this one of Ages then that mean with him amen amen it's a Rock of Ages that's why for some few [Music] minutes now as I was reading find out this if we take the book is this the time say the time I find something that is very known to you amen amen that is Page 15 that the brother there's a time when the brother spoke to brother Bram about this Stone how he he that is brother Junior Jackson brother Junior Jackson uh part of it says um and on the inside he says where do I start here that is Junior Jackson telling the dream appear somewhere like in Indiana there was a a great uh grassy Hill and the water had washed all the soil off the top and it became Rock like amen amen and the mountain and on the mountain then in this rock there was a funny writing Exodus you find it on the ex page 42 inter interpretation the outside amen amen amen because this he saw this white stone interpretation but there is an interpretation the outside interpretation all right amen because it says it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on amen amen amen now you realize that it talks about in the book ofs amen all right amen now Juni Jun he's the one that came to brother BR his dream and but there is an interpretation this Stone I mean this dream that he was given we will read it also we are just bringing them together all right amen but the White Rock or white stone was within all right amen now let's take it from yeah then you'll realize what is that white St and I'm so glad that that is where I have seen this seventh seal amen it's a mystery of Ages hidden in White Stone and those beings who were also part of it and we can see them today when that white stone is revealed [Music] amen it is so much that this message can show you the people that are going in the rupture all right amen they are here already visible okay amen now let's start here he that is filth let him continue being filthy that's only when the door is closed amen and the Mystery of it is he that is filthy it it shows as if he does not see himself and he that is or he that is righteous amen amen now continue you know that it is happening right now as I'm standing here there's one that is filthy is still contining he that is Unholy continues but yet still Pro coming as a Believer but yet is a Believer who is on the outside not inside now if a person is unrighteous and the word of God is preached to him he doesn't change at all when the door is cled that's why the message comes to that person he that is filthy anyhow let him continue because the door is closed it's over whether tomorrow he can say down bow down and say pray for me still it won't work amen amen amen that's why you never say your heart one day I will repent one day I'll do this understand that you won't do it one day you know they've been talking many times about this now I want to leave it you are not going to leave it amen amen because if I read souls in prison I come to a place where the prophet of God said the door is closed now if if that door is closed means that the people that are outside uh they can say yeah one day I'm going to repent one day I'm going to do this but not understanding that and knowing that the door is already all right amen that means it's over he that is this let him continue all right amen that's why we have reached a point of no return amen we have arrived like me as a preacher I Won't Go Back To those things I won't you'll never hear me again talking about those things things like you are appearing on this one what you call them social media WhatsApp WhatsApp what else what else I have finished amen amen he that let continue because the door is closed I will get it one day I read it to you it is I'll bring it in in this book SS in prison if you continue doing something you are a prisoner now that's why the prophet say Inon who will never never any time repent the work of the word of God don't work for them amen amen they are lovers of themselves all right amen now that's why the Rapture is coming but those who are going in the rupture um you can even see them you can recognize them how but you can recognize them the people that are going if you are going it's easy to recognize somebody who is going [Music] but let me read here and we close because it says just do what you are doing and carry on now the white sto H here in this book is this the time I quote to you this where brother Junior's dream he said to brother BR struck the top of the mountain uh ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off it was in the shape of a pyramid uh I will read to you there's so many pyramids you go to Egypt there's pyramids it is going to tell us about the Pyramid of the White Rock amen amen now he's speaking to brother you Str top of that mountain that's according to his dream and RI it around and lifted the cap of it was in the shape of a pyramid amen now that was month and month and month before before the pyramid message was preached and he said beneath that was a white Stone Granite Granite amen amen the Sun or the light has never shined on it before that's why there's a time all along the Seven Seals the seventh seal was not revealed amen okay amen but today did you know that to the bride of Christ it is revealed amen amen but to others it is still not revealed you'll know the reason because you have the church and the bride the church is something else the bride is something that's why you wonder sometimes you find the people in a church with with such hatred and you wonder how can you Worship in such a condition can a person who hates his brother what did the Bible says about he who hates his brother maybe you don't know don't know what is hatred amen amen you just hear talking about it but you don't know you know like Satan he doesn't know what love is amen he's a fallen being now a fallen being doesn't know when you talk about what are you referring to the nature in him what love is doesn't know what is love okay amen now let's look at this the white stone amen amen given to over an overcomer amen all right Amen Let us here beneath that was White Stone Granite the Sun or light has never shine on it before look in on this watch and let me continue with something okay I come to this light has never come upon it before when all of them got up I told them that's the prophet now to watch and all of them came according to brother Jackson all them came up to look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of his ey and watched me I slipped off to one side and started going west towards W that's the prophet because you know of these two places the Garden of Eden was on which side yes amen E Yeah amen and that's why for him to connect the angel he had to go amen right amen now if you can look at it even right now we have a coming this is the church that has been coming to connect with the angels message amen you can't see angels with your eyes all right amen but you know uh there was first commission healing the seek and all that things that the people like but there was the a new Commission Now this new Commission it was of the Angels not that the seven churches ministers no but it says God said to him this is a new your new commission and it was of the angel now since then H the bride of Christ it is for the bride of Christ it was a church and some people will remain as the message [Music] church but under the new commission is the bread of Christ no not the church because the new commission speaks of angels it speaks of the seventh angel with the seven seal angels angels angels [Music] angels amen it's not seven Messengers seven Messengers no I see the seven MERS seven messenger but seven angels if under the new amen commission amen then he himself says I was [Music] put pyramid pyramid of angels now from that pyramid it's now the Pyramid of amen amen amen now he was put in that of Amen now only the bride of Christ can see that now let's look there will be impation on that now somebody who impersonates he will wait till the bride says something then he comes after and say I've got a message from God but they call it in personation now we're talking about the people uh with a stone the white their names what about the stone the name written in the name a new name written amen yeah say brother what about the stone amen I will give him amen amen the other person doesn't know that name it's only the who knows it amen amen I believe that do you know your name I'm talking about the new the white stone name you will hear that it's talking about the the seventh seal the Seven Seals now why the people are still crying out the seven seal is not revealed amen of course if that is not your name it is not revealed to you what is revealed to you name amen amen so it makes difference if it is in you will you still be waiting because it is already in you okay let let's read and finish it it continues it's a it's a great that amen and he started going west you know when you see the prophet going west you you know of the connection he's going I went wward he says to connect with the angel message then when they brought the message to him he always says they came from amen coming to him for the for the message now I read here he went West towards the setting of the sun come up a hill going down a hill and so for getting smaller am and you know as he was getting small have lost him amen amen yes sir when he started and now the bride comes up you can see the bride now after he return with a message from from the West some they just saw him going but they have never seen him again now the saw him going then he returned [Applause] with a new message amen that's why we we read that we we we can come and read it again as he says I went wward to connect with the Angel's message and came back to preach so the whole thing has changed amen is the message from the west back east then he says to preach it after that Angelic connection now if coming back and he never preached to some other people who could believe what he preached but he preached to Those whom God has changed they they could hear the new message the Angelic one when he you see the difference now even now uh maybe you hear me maybe you don't uh there or standing in the Gap first here and page 16 back to Junior Jackson's dream it says and on the inside he says he speaks of that mountain we used to sing [Music] chorus it speaks of the rock I will remember it I will sing it for you rock coming from the mountain who's that k [Music] The Rock from the mountain he saw it rolling down MH amen okay amen now here it says and on the inside was White Rock not just a rock white you see in your heart as member of the Bride what is the color there amen the original color not mixed with the things of the world just pure white it's a place where God dwells all right amen a true true a True Believer this morning is somebody who can open his [Music] heart for God's Dwelling Place all right amen what is in your heart every morning whatever we are doing you open your heart either for Satan to come and do his things or you open your heart for God to come it depends what's in your heart but you have open your heart for somebody now there's two different natures one is of God one is of the enemy Satan which nature do you enjoy what is in your heart what are you thinking about all right amen not a church go but a jeer of your way amen amen not the church member but a doer of [Music] your not just a singer but AER you see is the doer of the way now the doer of the way is somebody with nature of God because the word is God God is a doer of his own way now if in you God he is a doer of his own way amen amen if there's another nature in you it will defy the nature of God so in you what nature is in you which nature is it of the white stone I will read it to you here this white stone was introduced amen but no man can himself put nature in himself so it is only God who can change how does God change somebody that's when he gives him a white stone amen amen and this person he knows [Music] himself who he is amen I can tell you that uh if I I were to ask this young people because most of them are the worshippers of the cell phone cell phone in their souls day and night they are worshippers of the cell phone you can talk the way you like change because it is only God who has changed our nature amen a divine nature as Peter says he has given us divine nature now you must thank God for that divine nature in amen amen because you don't receive it through a prayer it is God by predestination God has predestinated you to come and live in you nature in you is not your own nature divine nature is God's nature in you amen amen amen so that's why let me read this and on the inside of it was White Rock This is SS I mean standing in the Gap standing in the Gap M amen one of the things that really people cannot understand standing in there you know you ask which G because when man fuled his position God God will never change his plan if it should be a man in the if it is a man who should keep the book If this man fori God has to restore it again otherwise it would mean that God has failed all right amen uh that's why the bright is the original [Music] Church the original church is called the bride of Christ and because it is original if every time like it is God who came who comes to this bride to fulfill his word you must remember that I cannot fulfill the word of God through predestination comes and fulfill his way in you because he has predestinated you know he's responsible for that when Adam left his place because originally it was given from God God has close but how it should be men again he brings men back to the Gap if not that would mean God has failed if there is no restoration that would mean God has fa that's why there's a law of to restore amen amen after Satan has caused a damage the Lord God came back to redeem to redeem take it back again because if it is not taken back that means God has lost amen amen so we were in him for the foundation of the world Amen that's why the S seal has brought a restoration that that's this sister she was in God predestinated of God but born a sinner amen but God came and redeem him that is the work of God we can't redeem ourselves but what God redeems something that was in his mind amen amen he came to find in order to redeem you amen back again that's why you are in Fellowship as it was so shall it be amen now right now uh outside Redemption nothing is changing amen you hear me saying the cell phone worshippers after the service he still [Music] continue he can quit because there's only it's either his divine nature or Fallen nature all right amen they shoot a man for robbing people then after that if if he is taken to hospital then when he recovers from the wounds do you think he has repented no he's going back again that is his nature the nature that is in him amen you can preach he who hates his brother but do you think you'll find somebody who has changed no for to change that's when God takes his position in you meaning that originally you were in him now to change that's when he redeems you back to where you were that is redemp amen he doesn't make you something better makes you [Applause] himself because you are in his mind amen amen and God shall never lose all those attributes who in his mind that's why today he has come for the attributes these attributes are now in the Pyramid of theone of the Angels these attributes were in his mind now should God lose the attributes mean has lost his mind all right [Music] am that's why you will remain God's [Music] child because he says he has chosen you [Music] before there the the world came second when he created the world you were already in that's why they you an overcomer all right amen and an overcome is an attribute that was in the mind of God that's why John is it John 17 he says he speaks of you that he says they are not of this amen world the system mhm amen that's why the prophet says if you if you are coming to God maybe we'll understand a person called by God he will come passing all these other things until he is in the hands of God because death will do nothing to that person amen and the Lord God himself came in the form of men to prove that and he said destroy this and come on the third day and check you still find am now your body here on uh born of a woman it says a man born over a woman has few days that's why sin is in the body have you ever seen the people of today the Bible calls them the lovers of themselves who lovers of themselves want to be seen everything they do amen if he can buy a new hat want to be seen on it with it nature of somebody who has no God in his we want God to be SE we are preachers of the way preaching to the people in order for them to see God not to see themselves H in closing you see that thing yeah because we are we are we we are preaching for the Rapture now amen amen we are going to even if you could live another 100 Years by the time you hit the 100 You' be finished amen amen you know when a person is still young he'll do things but then he's aging then they tell you this man was a footballer this was was but the Bible says he is the god who is now if you are in God you are a brother or a sister who is amen because he is amen now you are in him you are a brother who is who is because I see you now even in one million years I still amen amen no years no age you know after this life there's no age now the person in you is Ageless amen that's why he worshiped God because God is ageless now the Ageless person in you ageless God says the world shall pass away is it not passing away the world is old that's why you see things every day what is happening today in this world it's aging but I am waiting for the ruption because this world is not my home you are waiting for the rapt because the world is not your home Jesus says they are not of this world we are not of this world he said so when he he told the enemy that we are not that's why the world hates if you see somebody who hates you he is the world Amen amen amen yes sir hey yeah this white sto amen and on the inside was a White Rock something on the order of granite something on the side some White Rock at that time it wasn't written it was just white the original color amen amen the time had not yet arrived but it continues to say and I said the prophet said to the Breen stay here look on this and while they were all looking I slipped out from among them and started going wor and uh so that is how it went now lastly uh I continue on this is this the time the time amen the same thing here he said look upon this light has never come upon it before when all of them got up I told them to watch that then came up to look in you know look look in H you are looking at me right now if you are looking at me but if you are not if you are the Child of Light you'll see what is in me otherwise You' go and say he can't be my pastor amen amen but you remain because if you can see what's in me you won't leave this place why what keeps you is because what's In Me Is reflecting in you amen you are together with with me you believe the message I preach so we are all one thing only one has to stand up and say and [Music] preach one has to stand up and to preach is just to say h to tell to tell you about the thing that is in you amen amen right now if I can start doing something else doing something else which is not in line with the word of God many people will just just leave and go amen amen amen why because they can no longer see that light because the true worshipers shall worship God in spirit and Truth Amen in spirit means what I preach to you amen amen it's what you expected me to preach to [Music] you you know there were some people you come here with expectation something in you is expecting that's why you come here because the thing I preach is in you amen now you come to say yes Lord is [Applause] like you see amen if I preach something contrary to that divine nature in you stop coming here and I can't stop preaching if some people are offended and they say I preach no I'm not I'm not I'm no preaching no but if there's some Souls Eternal Soul I'll continue to preach oh okay amen because there's a reflection Souls that will come here and say preach [Applause] iten why because they are predestinated they are expecting God to talk amen now inclusing Listen to I read this part when we we still got some things on the White Stone today we are just opening when he started West one it says he slipped off to one side started going towards the West towards the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down amen amen and uh but it's something here going down the hill up down but leaving the people behind them now he couldn't just say to them wait for me here no but he said to them keep looking watch the white stone kept them waiting there you see we are closing now going home but you still remain because there's a white stone you are looking at the white stone you will come back again [Music] here because there's something that is going on you are not just a church go because the word is a living wind it keeps on rolling and the Rapture something already new that says come as he coming there are people that are saying come meaning they are in contact can a person who love the world and the things of the world say come it's only those of his divine nature they are longing to meet him they say how long how long long amen amen they are just waiting for a reunion Revelation 21 amen amen says behold the Tabernacle of God is with men Tabernacle is not talking about the building is talking about God in his body say the Tabernacle of God is no long the Holy Ghost no he that [Music] [Applause] time that's why he says now the Tabernacle of God is with me at that time because now he will be body amen the amen amen you know I've got there at home a photo of how my Prophet saw him and they said yeah exactly like this I've got that photo at home you know sometimes I just look at it yeah and you know the spirit says the spirit and the bride says amen amen amen that is the spirit and the say come if your journey is finished amen amen what do you say come say the spirit and the Bride come even the one who hears he says come come now if you love this world you can't say come because I'm closing do you hear it the lovers of the world and the things of the world can never say come because he will disturb them like some body know some several people they come here some came here then another one is a sister you know I love that church wonderful people but the L now we wondered which because yeah we do not live by any law but we have a nature [Applause] and I can live without this amen nature amen what I mean is what I am receiving here I can live without it amen that's why you can't survive in any other church because you don't need a church him amen so that's why your nature puts you you belong the nature in you will always put you where you belong the nature of God will put you in God it is of the world will put you in the things of the world and they will pass away the things of the world they come but they will pass away but the person without divine nature amen amen he is also saying if the things that I'm doing will pass away I rather pass away I'll pass away with them there's people who can live without the word of God and there are some people who cannot live without doing what they are amen but their life is so [Music] short all right amen a sister asked me sister said let me put this we we come for the for the St a sister asked me one time she said to [Music] me uh what is that cycle of darkness and I said which one said down there cycle [Music] hug then I said do you know about the bottomless pit amen you know people like Judas are still rolling for you know what de said about Judas it is better let me hear again Jesus it was better if such a man was not born that's terrible if the Lord Jesus says that himself it was better that that's meaning that is that means his judgment is terrible it is better if the man was for the Lord to say that now I said to the sister do you know about the the bottomless pit you just keep on rolling she said no and uh uh she will come I can ask her to come and take the mic and tell you about it she promised that to come and see me then I I said do you know about the bottomless pit she said no I said why don't you ask them down there what is this she said no we are not allowed to ask unless they decide to tell you now then one day I was walking passing over the bridge down here in M when I looked down because I was walking I saw a cycle of Darkness after she told me the C of then I spoke to a brother about it is then I realized that she operated there but after she told me about that I saw that a [Music] cycle down there only to realize that she's operating there and I remember she took us with some brothers to the same place when we were asking her about some amen amen and uh she asked one day many a time is is God going to judge me like I W elaborate but she said is God going to judge you he mentioned somebody like that and then we said if you don't repent yes he's going to judge you but if you can repent then God is merciful then we went to the same place where I've seen that Cy because she told me about the cycle a huge one now when I went there I saw a cycle and I was told that she operates here and there one she came here when I talked about what is it what was it was it yeah think so yes just after that somebody arrived here with a container only to realize you know brother we realize that she wanted to come to the pool because when we were talking here she was at then while we were talking she started coming because their plans were stopped God that day when we were told that there's Judas here he has come to kill amen amen then when she arrived she was from that place coming here she wanted water that's why I said to the brothers clean the pool because something happened and they cleans the pool and we told the people you cannot baptize the people there because we have may the Lord of lords even be with you amen amen the Bible said fear not he said
