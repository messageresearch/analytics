all brothers and sisters in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I am the MC of the day before maybe we could start with our program let me just point out some few hints the the regulations in different places are not the same this place here is a plot being applaud now before we start with our preparations for this event we had to go around the neighbors making them aware that we will be having uh a day like this where will be dedicating this plot so you know we've got some different nationalities you know what's going on then we had to go to the police station also to inform them that we'll be having this because at the moment we don't have a permit that we can have an event in this place before you could have an event you must have a payment so now because we want to dedicate this place we just went around so the neighbors were very very kind to me and they supported us 100 percent and they even threw our guards here and brother knowledge they know them and they trust them so they even assured me that they will put me on their WhatsApp group so then the only thing that we need to be careful about is to make unnecessary noise because they said no everybody up to seeing everybody have to make noise some time but it should not be uh a continuous noise whereby at a certain time when they want to relax they should be disturbance but they are good neighbors okay that's all so now we are about to start with our program in our program we have some few items before we call the pasta uh let's start with the musical item sister pumla [Music] pradamus is not here I said I will take the place and then they they refused the your group said no you can't lie is here okay let's give a chance to our sister just to give us that solo I don't know where they solo you know how you've done it God bless you the sister let's just step ahead [Applause] honey [Music] you come home [Music] I mean [Music] [Music] yes [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] your eyes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you my sister We are continuing so our neighbors are not here but they just gave me a message that I must tell the pastor that you know they are engaged somewhere actually they gave me some books sadness is a present for the pastor so I have them in my car to show that that they are giving us a support and then in in introducing our visitors here we don't have any visitor apart from our pasta foreign this is our pastor from Leo Fountain amen okay he is accompanied by the deacon brother masaila can you rise and then they are also accompanied always is always with our longtime friend and that day uh can you just rise my brother thank you very much and so we you know that there is this regulations that we need to follow I believe we've all registered and we've taken our temperatures and we're keeping a distance and we have a sanitized isn't it so thank you very much let's go on to our next item that was Sister pumblr now we have here a speaker on behalf of their neighbors since their neighbors are not here the neighbors that were very really active is their neighbor that site it's a sister Pam we were with her yesterday so she also says thumb up then what she said she said now we need a church next to us and we need a pastor that will always go to him and let him pray for our problems because there's a lot of burglary in this place so that was a thumper up and then our other neighbors that site is Magda so he's the one she's the one that gave me books then she said no she's very happy about what is going to happen it's just that now she cannot be with us but she's supporting us 100 percent and she's a very supporting neighbor actually brother Victoria is Among Us he knows that he will always if there's any noise maybe dogs are barking she will call me right around 12 midnight to midnight if the alarm is on she will call it night and then we call the the security people so and then even giving guidance of how to handle the dogs how to feed the dogs and if a dog is sick she'll be the one that will notice that that dog is sick take it to the vet so we've got very supportive uh neighbors here so that's what I can say about them and then our next item it says the introduction of the steering committee let's just welcome him by taping our hands [Applause] God bless you my brother yes foreign greetings to you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank God for everything that is doing for us and as I normally say under the leadership of our pastor Israel in kodima we just see something's happening amen our God is good all the time my duty here is just to introduce the steering committee the steering committee is the brothers or the elders that the pastor has nominated together with our chief decoratories to run this project this is a project and then by the advice of the elders a certain expertise were elected to run it for our pastor amen so in the steering committee we have a chairperson I'm going to ask him to stand up so that you can see is our precious brother tagani Pilla he is the chairperson of this project he's a planner as well because he normally knows how to run the project so he is assisting Us big time for this project to be a success amen and then we have products is not amongst us today I believe so yes he is our scribes he's the one who normally when we have the meeting he will take the minutes and then he will advise as well because he's a financial specialist of how to run the finances of this place so that things could go smoothly amen as he's not here and then we have brother Franz Maja may he stand up he is our planner as well on the architectural side he knows very well how the buildings goes and so forth so he's advising that imagine may you raise the children of God can see you and the cameras amen Hallelujah we we have brother Ruben morave he is not amongst us today as well he's got some commitment so he normally advise us on environmental matters he is an environmental aspect how things should be run in this project you know environmentally foreign may God bless him as well amen and then we've got myself brother Naomi carreza I specialize in health and safety so to make sure our health is okay we are safe here everybody has sanitized everybody has tended to take to take the temperature and it will leave this place safely not always my knowledge but with the help of God we are a church amen we've got our elder brother August maruleka if he may stand I saw him at the back somewhere there or maybe he deal with geography you know the area we are we are situated it needs some body who knows how the governments run like we've got the bylaws we've got the national laws so it is very much good with that he is communicating with them municipality he knows what's going on here in Pretoria and Johannesburg or maybe Houghton as a whole so he's our advisor and is doing a good job when you see us end up being here little by little it is because of the initiatives he he took amen may God richly bless him he is our financial advisor how to run the finances for the project then so that things could go smooth as well our precious brother where is he chy bless you then this way the expect in those fields that I mentioned for the project but above all we've got deacons that are in the steering committee as the guider EXO official members of of the steering committee we've got our Elder that is kosana is normally in every meeting May you stand daily I know you are emcee the camera must in Hallelujah in in every meeting we make sure he is there to advise on all angles and then at the end amen because he is the CEO amen the last member that we have on the understanding committee is Prada Denmark City May you stand my brother [Music] he is our Deacon in mamelodi when the project is complete completed you will be a dick on this you know new church so he normally works with the discosana to oversee the expect in the steering committee is it clear so when you see the program I mean the the project going on and gone and going smooth and things happening very well this steering committee is the one that is taking the lead and then the church will help with prayers shallow [Applause] [Music] thank you breneo I made a previous mistake until brother Monday came and showed me that I have jumped a very very important item um [Laughter] I overlooked he was supposed to give us a welcome speech [Music] will you will forgive me for that come my brother God bless you amen foreign I would like to greet the pride of Christ in the most wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ I like to create faster makua in our midst and also create our Joshua of this hour of this age Hallelujah we are happy to have him Barcelona with us because every time when he preaches I always feel my spirit that he is getting it directly from God Amen so I just want to say something just few words as I've been requested Hallelujah to bring that dedication ceremony speech or a welcoming speech rather but before maybe I can start I just want to say this that I remember the day when our pastor came to my house to dedicate my house amen we were having enemies but we didn't know that we had enemies until after the dedication that's when we realized because because whatever the devil was hiding it came up now you know the Bible says you you need to know that you are not fighting against the Flesh and Blood Allelujah but we are fighting against the spiritual spirits so when we find out about that and then I knew in my prayer that how am I gonna pray because the Bible says we need to love them amen if they do you wrong you must do them right Hallelujah amen so now as we are in this ceremony where our pastor will be dedication dedicating this land in my spirit there was this uh scripture normally the pastor would like to quote when Moses were crossing the Red Sea it was such a hard thing to them Farah was coming behind them in front of them there was a sea that they need to cross but there's something that God said to them that go forward Hallelujah so where we are I know that every time when God gives something the devil will try to bring tactics will try to stand against it but there's one thing that I know that the Egyptians that you saw you shall see them no more Hallelujah so that's where we are now the Lord shall fight for us hallelujah but for us we shall just hold our peace Hallelujah the fight is not ours even the fighting that we are facing is not yours because when you fight back we are opening doors for the devil to come in Hallelujah in the Bible says we mustn't give the devil any Place Hallelujah because it will be hard to take him out because already he's got a place amen now this is a welcoming speech I've just saw some quotes from our prophet that I would like to quote them while I'm doing the welcoming speech in this Baza one I'm welcoming each and every one of us Hallelujah and also the spirit of God who is within us we'd like to thank God that we are not alone but we are going together with our seven seal Hallelujah in the third pool amen now Prada pranam is saying here when we in fellowship with God we don't have to worry about anything Hallelujah God will care and provide all we need for this journey so we don't have to worry about anything Hallelujah God is our provider already as I've said that what happened in my house I can imagine what will happen in this place Hallelujah because as the pastor will come and dedicate there are things that are going to happen Hallelujah I'm talking about spiritual things because when things sometimes are not working out you don't have to look them in a physical side but you need to understand that this is a spiritual world Hallelujah and when things are not going right physically you need to understand there's something wrong spiritually so what you need to do you need to fix spiritually then the download will come into your physical Hallelujah so now there is a verse that I want to read just to read it blesses me so much and I believe that it also gonna bless you as I welcome everybody Amen in the Book of Psalms 92 12 to 15 it says because now as we are here hallelujah this is going to be a land we are going to build in the Tabernacle of God Amen and also there are people there's a pride of God that will be there but this is what David is saying in the Book of Psalms the Russians shall flourish like the palm tree they shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon in other words when we are here hallelujah and we are righteous something short is going to happen spiritually those that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the court of our God now this one it blesses me so much it says they shall still bring forth fruits in their old age Hallelujah when I see our old age who are with us you could see that probably they are aging physically but spiritually Hallelujah they are bringing forth fresh fruits [Music] I remember the other day when he had his birthday he said that he sometimes surprised when he come to maybe a stop when he's driving maybe the police will come to him and they will say to him an old man he would like to see him like say what do they mean that I'm all men because I can still do everything Hallelujah now God is giving us bazalwani the power to do everything even in our age so the Bible says that they shall bring fruits we can see that in our pasta we can see that in Bible School can say to everybody that there is new man a fresh manna that is coming Hallelujah from uh the old age amen now the the last verse says this is to show that the Lord is upright he is our Rock and there is no and rashes in him Hallelujah so with these few words Barcelona I just want to welcome every one of us that he let us continue and celebrate because the victories is ours God bless you amen foreign [Music] okay let's continue our next item it's the chairman of the steering committee he will come just to brief us about where did they start and how far are they now and explain everything the chairman of the steering committee committee is our brother tsakane Pila let's welcome him by tapping our hands [Applause] foreign to the bride of Christ Hallelujah I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen are we happy [Music] let us let us let us give God a handling [Applause] this is the days that the Lord God has made let us rejoice and be glad in it amen so ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters beloved of the Lord Sons and Daughters of the most high God I greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen [Music] it is an owner it's a privilege for me to stand before you this afternoon as the chairman of the steering committee amen my a my purpose is to give you a brief a report on the processes since we started or from the time we embarked on the process up until today amen so before I continue I just want to make an addition to what Dr Maharaja was doing when he was introducing the members of the committee he forgot to mention brother and I'm going to request him to stand pratava where are you ah man may God richly bless you he is he's a member of our committee amen he is on the technology side and your contribution batavo is always appreciated amen before I brief you before I go on I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge God amen who has made this day a possibility amen you know I want us to salute God Amen the pastor always we must salute him amen We Salute him this afternoon we say Lord we thank you thank you for making it possible hey there is none like thee we give you all the Adoration all the praise belongs unto you and we want to thank you for the leadership that you've given us that is standing before us this afternoon amen this Church of God is being led Hallelujah as much as we have God leading us we are acknowledging him we saluting him but he said in his way I will give you lead us specifically he said I will give you pastors Hallelujah so this church was alone is being led by an experienced General amen [Applause] let's have a good time [Applause] this is the day the Lord has made for us let's make it a pleasant day to be a day we can remember hallelujah amen amen just turn to the person next to you and say God bless you God bless you God bless you amen amen amen we we are led by an experienced General a veteran I call him an able minister amen those that know him from long they call him the old man but if you find him in the presence of the youth you can call him a young man amen I just called him master and others calling him Kulu others call him brother but what is amazing about him is that he fits in all those roles you call him amen [Applause] one thing that I must mention the very smart dresser Hallelujah an he dresses smart he always look good in his suits I wish I can always go shopping with him because he's got a good eye and he pays attention to details Hallelujah you know even when he buys perfume perfume because when he buys a perfume it must be a perfect one rather I know enough until he get another one but when he gets another one he makes sure he gets a good one amen a I always say when I tease him when he is with the elders I would say you know how makachi if a stranger will come and ask hurry past tacky man it's gonna be obvious or who's the past Hallelujah this one is the pasta I mean the way he walks the way he dresses the way he talks you know with those hands in his Hallelujah he's foreign [Applause] [Music] we salute you man of God we thank you for all the prayers you've given this committee and we say may God richly bless you Amen Let me thank the bot of the Church of mamelodi for the support given to us and we say may God actually bless you Hallelujah and and also the steering committee members I want to say God bless you all for all the time the hard work the dedication you've given in all the tasks that you were given may God bless you amen I'm here to update you on the status of things from the time we started up until now the reason I'm doing this it is because I want everyone in this place amen to know where we are to know where we're coming from to know where we are going amen I want us to close the gap I want us to close any vacuum amen I want you to be the people who will represent the committee I don't want anyone when it is asked and now everyone will just throw hands in the air and say I don't know what they're doing I'm here to tell you as the chairperson where we are where we're coming from and where we are going amen so that we all are in the same place amen same place same baptism single understanding same Faith all same amen when the committee was appointed by the body and the pastor we are all very much excited excited by the Mandate given to us because already we could Envision a church standing in this place Hallelujah this was the time when you were coming from Birchwood when we would have conferences and we would have like lots of um spend lots of money on on on Beachwood amen so we actually was looking forward to to to having our own Birchwood amen and that was the vibe at that time to say we need to have our own Birchwood amen so maybe even before let me start by saying just to tell you about this place a little bit is that this place was found by that area found this place and approached the pastor and approached the board to say hey there is a place that I have found and I think it could be a good place for the church and the pastor and the boat looked at it and they saw that it was actually a good place amen so I just want you to not to forget that it was entitled who introduced this place to us as the church and the board and the pastor at large amen so he is with us he is listening in the dimension may God bless you masalani so we then impact as the committee I told you we were excited we embarked on a process which I call it a consultation process where we consulted certain members of the church to try and come up with a wish list a wish is to say in a church the pastor always complains about the cables that the cables must run under a tunnel there must be this there must be this so that you know we get our chest to be a perfect church so we compiled a wish list Hallelujah it is that wish list that we were going to use to consult with the architects so that we tell the Architects to say Architects this is what we want and therefore you must come to our plot so that you can see what we want and then give us a plan a design but this is our wish list amen but then the process started we call the Architects we believe them on what we're looking for and they were quantity surveyors that came here to physically see what is on the ground so that they can come up with desired designs and we received beautiful designs masalani and beautiful quotations to build a church amen that almost every member had some form of input in it amen and it was as I indicated it was very exciting but this is what I want to tell you about navigation we in fact saw ourselves as more of a committee that was going to assist in fundraising efforts to get this church built our our our understanding of the Mandate was that we were going to come bring our expertise and look at ways wherein we can actually get this church to be built by looking at fundraising and all that but there came a turning point in our committee where we had to do a 360 degree about 10. and start the process of getting this place rezoned for worship because all along the narrative was the place was a was already zoned so we were only coming in to assist in making sure that we get the building erected and getting but we got a shock of Our Lives when we learned in the process and when we get the rezoning certificate that this place this beautiful place has not been rezoned so now we had to like make a 10 about a 362 360 Degrees to start the process of rezoning this place all of us we did not have the experience of rezoning especially for a church of this magnitude so now we had to pause a bit on the architectural side of things and start to chase the rezoning process because that one cannot do before this one amen so we started to engage with the city of China I was going with the the way and then they actually encouraged us to appoint a consulting firm that will help us with the processes because these are the companies that does this all the time and they know the ins and outs then we appointed a company called Gap developments as the Consultants or as our Consultants amen so after several engagements with gap developments back and forth we were able to launch an application to get this place resolved in 2018. amen now as we did that to an responded to our application and then they said we needed to do investigations we need to do that to do studies that should accompany the application amen so there has to be an investigation on the roads and stormwater there has to be investigation on the flat line so the drawings that you do must not be on the flat line the flat line must even the parking must not be on the flat line so it means a surveyors must come here and make a drawing that actually fits into those so that when you do your investigation your report sticks to to the parameters that the city requires amen the topographical survey a traffic impact assessment report bulk services that is the water the section 7 report how trans GLS report mahalis Water Report amen all these studies as we're doing them they needed to be paid so all along the trust is when this report was required the trustees would pay when this report was required the trustees would pay and thanks to you trustees because it will not be have been possible if it was not through do your support amen now the period you're with me again so that when I tell you we are here and then this is where we are going so that we are all together amen now the period it takes for a report like for example if there is a traffic impact study there has to be people that come here and look at the cars that passes at various times or various peak times to to to to to look at the impact or the impact of the flow on the flow of traffic this establishment would do so there is all so and all these reports they go to various divisions within the city and they don't go to a single individual they go to this one and they go to this one and those people they need to respond with comments and those comments must go to the consult the consultant so that they can adapt the application to suit the comments that they are making amen now if there's one report that I want to particularly bring your attention to is the traffic impact assessment report now that is the report I just told you about now when this report was done the city of tshwanee was very happy with our report amen but because this traffic or the road this road is not the rotia city it's the road here the Department of Transport so the city must take the report to the city to the gauten traffic Road and transport to make a determination as well now here we found a big challenge because we waited for almost almost a year because we would send emails we would do this nothing happens and it came last I think towards the uh at the beginning of 2020 that's when we got a respond from the roads and traffic department and they also had comments amen I'm happy to report to you that all the reports the investigation has been done to date and the only thing that is left for us is to get together zoning is to comply with the comments that delayed and that came through the roads Department amen now I want to take you through the comments by the Department of Roads they are saying as you can see this main road it's a it's a busy road they're actually saying we need to have a big traffic second erected on that road okay and then have another a traffic circle that comes through the gate here that is the recommendation and that is the condition before we result before they give a a a a because and it hopefully it comes from the the their impact assessment studies now they also say this route it's called bergroot if I'm correct this bear fruit is too narrow yeah so we need to expand it so now it means we need to go to the neighborhood which we have done and the neighbor has agreed to give us a space and then when we were busy with with with with the neighbor so that we can now register a servitude when you do that you must have the servitude registered in other level you will understand that that process you'll you need to have a Solitude registered in favor so that when that person sells that Solitude will remain for everyone that is using this road amen now as we were busy with the Solitude registration we got a challenge we got a challenge there was a hold or there was a they call it a covet or moratorium on the on the plot next door to say nothing must happen to that plot and now it was a hold at this office and therefore it will we had that challenge so we actually started with that process we we spoke to miss Fender Miss Fender that's the lady Pam uh was talking about she was very supportive and we continued with the lawyers and we managed you know I don't want to bore you with with all the the the you know the integrities of of of of of what we had to go through but let me just tell you that in that process we actually it took a bit of time it was almost a challenge for us but by the grace of God the other day I took in the Disco Center we went and saw the lady the lawyer who was helping us and then the lady went to the Deeds office and then he had to get a an order from the high court and now as we speak about two weeks or three weeks ago the high court gave an order to remove the hold now there is no more a hold therefore means we can go ahead with our arrangement with the lady now as we speak the lady has got the agreement which she must sign that this Persona gave it to her because we can or or a few days back the lady has to sign that agreement so that we can register a Savage route once the service shoot is registered it means now we have met all the conditions of reasoni Hallelujah and then from there on then we need to do the work we need to do the construction of the traffic second we need to do a traffic circle here we need to do the widening of the road as per the conditions they have put and there's a few with regards to the park services here because there'll be more people so it means even the services has to be enlarged a bit Hallelujah so where we are we are now at the pro or at the point where we are Consulting so that we can get an estimation an exact estimation of what is going to cost us to do this and all that and everything here to get this place or to meet all those conditions so that we can then go in and say now we're starting to put the first prick or go back to uh this process that we had started with initial and when that happens or after we have this estimate and everything as the committee we will go and meet the pastor will go and meet with the board and tell them what we have found what are the costs and what and then therefore a determination will be made when we have that amen foreign you I think I've just finalized a lot uh I must I Just Want to Thank You Believers for for being with us we understand that you you were looking for a place of worship that you you were already also in self to be here I just wanted to explain to you that it's actually not very easy as we were busy with the process we found a challenge but God has been with us because we've been able to I believe we've been able to overcome all the challenges that we that we have come across amen now we will engage with the city of tshwanee once we have got estimate to see what is it that they can do to assist us or lend a hand because that road will not be used by US only it will be used by the the the the community the site and so those are the steps that we will that we will do so we also want to promise you that will give the church a report maybe twice in a year just to tell you how far we are so that you are not left in the dark not knowing what we are busy with and I was saying we want to thank you bazarani for your continued support we need your prayers and you have continued to pay your building fund even when you were not getting reports from us and uh and and for that we want to thank you and we want to encourage you I mean we we come too far to look back hallelujah amen so let us continue to contribute we and we will be coming in to brief you more about about where we are and things like that and feel free to ask us if this question but I want to believe that from now everybody understand where we are and everybody who knows what is left so when you meet me you will be asking me how far are you with this thing not that hey nothing is happening what is happening because what is happening you all know you'll just be specifically asking me how far are you with regards to this because I have told you amen now uh I believe within the next three months we'll be done with the costing of what it will actually cost us to do all this thing and we will have a A Way Forward on that so thank you for uh your support and I just want to say thank you there is brothers that that has kept this place the way it is and and we want to want to thank them I mean the surveillance I want to acknowledge you in the in the presence of the pastor and the church for the contributions that you have made to get this place to be where it is uh that is um I don't know the pastor will maybe the pastor will say but I'm not sure if you Lord it is within but maybe I can say if you look at the fence here I know man you know some things must be told and we should not hide them if you when you look at this fence the brothers the family the sugola family has contributed to make it the way it is and for me it just shows that there's the will in this church has is able and we just need that time when they say we are starting you'll see wonders there a lot of things is going to happen amen so as well as Buddhism and uh
