We know that this seventh se cannot be opened or broke to the public. Now realize that there is public and queen the price. He says until that hour this seal being open to us and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. It's a special one. It's not for the public. Okay. Amen. Then I come to this. We have in the complexion here now by the grace of God all the mysteries of the six seals that's been sealed up. We understand it. And now they that they that okay now here that the seventh seal is not known to the public. So the sixth it is also open to the bride. The bride knows about the s but the servant is only known by the bride [Applause] not not by the church by the by the bride. Okay. Now then you will know that when we speak or talk about the seventh, we are only talking to the bride, not to everybody. Because everybody it says there is this the public and the bride. Now what is revealed to the bride is not known to the public. Just as we are like this this morning, you are member of the bride then you are blessed. [Applause] Amen. So I read is the prophet talking here and 103 seals. 103 seals. I don't know if I have it quickly here with me. Amen. 103. If somebody has it, if somebody has it 103 103 paragraph 255. Paragraph 255. Amen. Yes, I have it here. All right. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Yeah. It says again, "But now he comes from here at this last seat. He is no more a mediator." Yeah. Stop a bit there. Amen. You know what is a mediator? Somebody standing for you. And should you lose a mediator, there's no one to stand for you. So this is what it says here. Amen. Amen. He is no more a mediator. A mediator. When? Now. Read it. It says, "But now he comes from here at this last se, the seventh seal. Right. He is no more a mediator. He is king." Now when he hits the seven, he is no more. Amen. I I have heard many people saying the seventh seal is not revealed. Meaning they don't have a meaning. Amen. Amen. Read that, brother. It says, "But now he comes from here at this last sea, the seventh." Mhm. He is no more a mediator. Right. Amen. He is no more. He is now. He is now a king now. Right. Amen. There's many uh scriptures talking about the same thing. is no longer a mediator. He is now to to those seven seal is not revealed. He is not their king. He he is a king to which ones the bride to to whom the seven seal is revealed. this he is a king. Now as you we you are the sons of Abraham Abraham. What did that scripture say about Abraham? It says, "And Mechisedc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God, and he blessed him and said, blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth." Right? Amen. Meaning he came to Abraham, not at that time is not to the world, it's to Abraham. Abraham. Amen. As a king. [Music] Okay. Amen. Now, one part the same uh page here 574 574 paragraph 397. Paragraph 397. Now that the seventh seal is not to the public, it's not known to the public. Now it is telling you that there is a public and the bride. The bride. Now there's special message for the bride which is not to the public. The public can sit together with the bride and they are unable to know what the bride is receiving. Amen. Amen. If the if the bride received him as a king, they can't. Hallelujah. All right. Amen. Amen. We are talking about something. And now here that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public. You have the bride and the puppet. But when he reveals the seventh seal, it's only to the bride. How many times have you have you heard some people saying the seven seal is not revealed? That is the public. Amen. It depends. If you you you are saying to us the seventh is not revealed you are. Amen. I think now you understand. Uh now page 574 574 paragraph 3 93. uh paragraph 393 uh it says the sixth seal has been opened to us. We see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. Amen. Until that hour arrive. Okay. Amen. We know it. The six seal is no is open to us. Yeah. Say it again, brother. The sixth seal has been opened to us, right? We see it. Yes. And we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. That's right. Amen. It's us and the public. Now, we know he says it is open to us. And we know because if it is not open to you, God says you are a public. Now you should know from today and you want to engage yourself in a public and a bright arguments arguments. If somebody says the seventh is not revealed then you say I hear you [Applause] public. Amen. Now uh page two2 where it says he is no more a mediator maybe read it from the book. uh 122 paragraph 51 51 it says he was a mediator between that but when the real revelation happens on the se as they begin to break the lamp is coming forth from the sanctuary it's according to the word we read it we read it last night he come from there out of the midst of the book and took the book. So he is no more a mediator because even they call him a lion. Thus the king he is not a mediator then. Okay. Amen. I think you are we are together here. Amen. This is an announcement to you that he is no more a me. He is a king. A king when now this morning. He is a king. All right. Amen. He was a mediator before. Uhhuh. Amen. at the altar, but now he is no more a mediator. All right. And the prophet says, when now u the bride of Christ arrived where he is now a king, he says they rejoice. Amen. Amen. Amen. He was a mediator to them, but now he is a king. The king to the bride. King Jesus. Amen. Amen. Now the time of mediation has passed. You know. Amen. At the altar, as the prophet says, he used to be a mediator, but not now. I mean, to the bride, he's not a mediator. Okay. Amen. Abraham, Abraham met the king, the king, not mediator. Amen. You see now the bra the bride also now when the sea seven seal was opened he received a king. Amen. Okay. Amen. And here here again 574 page 574 574 paragraph 3 93 93 Did we read that that yes now let's pass to this one uh2 paragraph 51 51 Amen. Okay. says he come from there out of the mist and took the book. So he is no more a mediator because even they call him a lion and that's that's the king and he is not a mediator then because he has the book he took the book but what did he do with the book? He came down with the book. He came down to the book with the book and now the book according to the word of the prophet is with the bride. Amen. Amen. Amen. So when the son fated the book which was Adam, it went back to the [Applause] original. Amen. Amen. Because when it was in the hands of Adam, Satan came. Now to keep it, the Lord took it back. Then you know we can come with that uh one next time. how that the book was given back to the son to Adam. Adam. Amen. Now those to whom to whom the book was given, they know themselves. They've got a book. Their names are in that book. They know who they are. Amen. Amen. That's why they don't get engaged in arguments. Some saying it is another one is not the bride is not in that argument because they know who they are. That's right. And then now you know there was I was this morning I was looking at something you know even uh I was with the brother and uh we were reading you know to the bride the word is so patable. Why? Because the it is the book of the bride. Uhhuh. Amen. The husband offer the wife this certificate of eternal life. Amen. Amen. You know if a person has a a certificate of eternal life, you'll see him always reading that certificate. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because to her, he is not a mediator. He was a mediator. But now the bride, he is a king. Not a mediator. All right. Amen. Uh I was sharing with the brother that this message you know it tells you of who you are. Amen. Let me read something for you here which we will come to that next time. We have the pyramid pyramid number one. Which pyramid? Pyramid number of Enoy. Now that was the that was the pyramid of a stone. But the prophet says found these stones shaped already for the pyramid. [Applause] He was not chopping chopping. No, they were prepared already for him. [Applause] All right. Amen. And if I come here, it ends. We We still have to come to the pyramid of angels. Amen. Okay. Amen. Amen. Don't worry if you don't hear but worry worry. Amen. Because today you are saved only when you are in the pyramid. Hallelujah. If you are not in the pyramid you the seventh seal is not. Amen. Amen. You are outside. maybe peeping through the window but you are not in because the prophet speaks of [Applause] the ministry is only understood by the inside of what of the pyramid and we are not talking about something we that is only readable. But these are now if I say you are in the pyramid. If you say amen, that would mean you are in the [Applause] pyramid because you can't say amen to something you don't know. But amen, I am in the pyramid. me. Amen. Uh I'm just afraid to There's a man that man offends a lot of people. Amen. Amen. This man, there's a a witness here. every Sunday. I understand. He live streams every Sunday. Amen. But let me rather not tell you about him. But there's a witness here. [Music] The rapturing lights. lights. He knows about these things and I understand he is with us even on Sundays and there is another one but let me not rather let me okay now let's look at this You know if the message we are preaching, we are preaching it's you'll rejoice every time [Applause] we because to enjoy the message you should be the message otherwise amen you'll be griefed. every time. If I can tell you that like the Lord said to Peter, Peter and upon this rock some were grieved. And should Peter say, the Lord himself said, I am Peter. Amen. Amen. Men You hear him now? He's trying to make himself something. If the Lord says you have eternal life, you are not making yourself something yours is to rejoice. Amen. Amen. Because you have eternal. Amen. Amen. You will sing unto the Lord for you didn't gave yourself eternal life. It is the Lord Jesus Christ. Look, he said, who do men say I son of man, son of man, and Peter said, thou art the Christ. And he didn't look around and say, "What can I say? It's a hard question." No, the answer was in Peter. That's why he didn't go around. What can the answer be? No. Peter just said, "Thou art the Christ. Son of the living God. That was all. And the Lord said, "Thou art Peter, thou art Peter." So it was not all to eat. And upon this rock, Amen. When he said to them, when he said to him, "Thou art Peter," everybody could say, "Yeah, yeah." But when he said, "Upon this rock," some were [Applause] griefed. Upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hedges shall never prevail. Amen. Amen. Even this morning, the gates of hell never prevail. Amen. Okay. Amen. You know, he was Jesus, son of the living God. You can he got some items and items. But that day He wanted to share with a man. He is the rock of ages. But he said to Peter, "Thou art." And he came in the form of a man to build his church upon a form of a man. So he wanted somebody with the name little stone because Peter means little stone. Little stone. So among those he has chosen he was looking for somebody with this name. Little stone. Little stone. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Then when he found Peter, he said upon this rock because you know even the pyramid pyramid there's a stone, white stone. We are not through with that. The white throne. the white root stone in the pyramid we we will still come with that even here there's part of it here where it says the third that means the third came from the west Um do you know that scripture in Genesis 2? It says verse 8 I think you know or just read it a bit Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed. Right. Amen. Man was put east what? Eastward. Then later this the Lord Jesus said it it says he went west men was eastward eastward but to connect with the angels he went eastward westward. You know we have read it many time. Amen. Amen. To connect with the angels message. Then he came back. Yes. Amen. We'll talk about east and west. Amen. Man was east. Eastward. and you go west, it's angels, you'll see it even here when when he met with the angels. Amen. He said, I met he met the angels, flying angels. Amen. I can I can let me look at something here. Amen. you know, uh, page 576, 576, he speaks of a notable angel. The angel was very notable to me. Then he says, the rest of them just seemed ordinary. But this angel, he's talking about the notable one was noted angel. He was to my left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid. So these are angels. Now you have a you have a pyramidal pyramid of stone. Tell me about this pyramids. Another pyramids. Pyramid of stones. There's a time when it is a pyramid of stone and the next thing is a pyramid of angels. Angels. Lord. Another time is the other time is the bed. Amen. Things like this. He typed these things. Now he speaks of an angel that was notable to him. The rest of them just seemed ordinary. But this one as Peter had a stone you also there's something in you. Amen. Amen. The message you have received it is something in you like with brother here. What was it? the engine. All right, let me let me read. Yes. Amen. Then sometimes he refers to him as the angel with the seventh seal. That's where now the people need an esproad. Yes. Yeah, you know to us it it it is in the heart because if it is not in the heart and uh it happen to be in the head then that's where you find a denomination the way if it is in the head it's a denomination. Amen. All right. Amen. But if brother Brennham says I went westward because man was placed west east. Yes. Now to go west it says Genesis 2 chapter 2 verse 8. Okay. Uh uh uh yeah. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed. Amen. Where? Eastward. Eastward. So that's why he says I went westward to connect with the angel's message because men was pleased. Now to meet the angel he says I went west to meet with the angel even it is like that we'll see it where he talks about east to west and the prophet says east and west [Applause] that's why Now the east the angel you know that's why the message you have let me finish it here the angel another thing I want you to notice that's taken place and if you are listen to the tables says what it You will notice that the angel was notable to me. I'll tell you that you know yourself. You know that there is something with you which is not human. Uhhuh. Amen. And uh you know I was talking with the brother he's uh we were looking reading about the what's taking place now. Uh God is talking to us from before the creation. [Applause] Amen. Amen. And he is even showing until it comes to the rings. And it shows back there coming rings after rings and so forth until Jerusalem the city coming up like that. Now he showed the rings showing that it is the end. There is a new city coming. Now that's why God wants me to say bye-bye to because there's coming a new Jerusalem. Now this new Jerusalem, there's a king. All right. Amen. And now it is a king and subject subject. Now the bride of Christ is the subject of the king. All right. Amen. Now a subject was taught led by God and a subject knows the king and they know a subject knows the law. Amen. Amen. All right. We'll come to that. Let's let's look at this. Uh notice that one angel was very notable to me. The rest of them just was seemed ordinary. Amen. H there is this one notable to us. The rest of them, rest of the pastors, rest of the churches, ordinary. Now that's why you can't go and worship in an ordinary church. Peter knew the notable one. But only Peter knew and the Lord Jesus Christ also Peter was notable to the Lord. That's why among all of them he said who do men say I the son of man am you see they said some say that Some say this, some just like today. Then he said, "And now who do you say that I, the son of son of man am?" Now you can say, "I know you are the son of man." And you will say, "Whoa, do you say that I the son of man am? Amen. Amen. So they just look around like that and Peter said, "Thou art son of the living God." I don't know if the Lord Jesus had. Amen. Amen. And Peter knew something. He He couldn't just call him anything, but he says, "Thou art the Christ." The Christ. He didn't say, "Thou art Jesus." Amen. Amen. You You must read between the lines. Who do men say that I am? Some say, some say, some say he was called by many type of types of names. Now he was looking for one who knew him. The one who say the right thing, who called the right name, who do men? Amen. Amen. And Pet is it Peter? Yes. Who said some say this, some say that? Amen. Amen. Amen. and until he said, "Who do you say?" Who believes that the seventh seal is revealed. And what do people say? It's not allowed. But you say it is revealed. Right. Amen. Now you that say it is revealed. Amen. Uh you can you are you are not an answer to the one who says it is not allowed to do. Amen. Amen. Don't you say don't say that I will keep on praying for him until it is revealed to me. No, thou art Peter. It was not through a prayer. It is through predestination. [Applause] The Lord never said and Peter never said, "Lord, let me pray first so that I can give you the answer that I know." But who do you say I the son of man am? There was not no meeting held. maybe coming together saying what what can we say? He wants the answer. He wants an answer. It came straight from Peter before he was born. Amen. be before he was in the human body, the answer came thou art the Christ because Christ is something that is not visible. Amen. Amen. Now because Peter predestinated by God that name was in Peter. The message that you you believe you came with that message. That message was already in you. And when it was preached to you, you said amen. It's not from Bible school. It is with you from before the foundation of God. Amen. Amen. And Christ knew that I am standing with the people who came from where I came. They should know me. [Applause] Amen. Now he didn't say who do Balana say that I am the Pentecostal sing the church the church. He said, "Who do you Are you listening as I'm closing? Who who do you?" He was talking to a being that was there with him. He could not know him here after his birth. No. Amen. That's why he started saying who do men. Amen. Amen. Some said now in his mind he had some people I mean in his heart. Amen. But the question was to the public. I mean it reach even the public who do men say yes. He didn't say what does the bread say I am. No it can it cannot come that way. But who do men now Peter you know the stone the the message always is coming from the stone. Amen. Who do men say I the son of man. Amen. Now, Peter didn't say it from here. No. If then he ever tried to say it from here, it wouldn't work. Amen. The Lord Jesus asked this question knowing that the the answer is here. [Applause] Peter is here. He is the answer. So that's why he says, but who do you say? The people say who do you say that I am? The same question. We have questions here. But one question will come from heaven. [Music] But an answer from the world, it will always be contrary. If the question is asked by the one who came from heaven, it will only answered by the one who came. [Music] [Applause] Not just a man born here in 1936. No coming to the end here. Now we read this is very important. Uh let's read maybe the last one here that is uh page 122. Page 122. It is the same about the mediator. Yes. Paragraph 51. He come from out of the midst and took the book. So he is no more a mediator. Pardon sir. Pardon me, sir. [Music] Uh, okay. Yes, you are right. Yes. Read please. Is this page 122? Yes. Paragraph 51. Amen. Okay. He come from out of the midst and took the book. So he is no more a mediator because because even they call him a lion. That's the king. And he is not a mediator there. M amen. Now this book was returned to men. You know that and because there was a Peter among them meaning Peter what little stone little stone. Yes. Amen. The Lord made sure that when he was calling them one by one there should be a sto that's why Peter was the one chosen amongst them. pyramid. Pyramid. There was a stone in the pyramid. Now man is also made like a pyramid. Amen. If there's nothing in you, there won't be anything. Because as I'm closing here, there was a stone in the pyramid and a stone in a man. Now in order to occupy a pyramid, Peter had a stone. That's why the Lord said upon this stone, I'll build my church. Amen. Amen. He he he he he has chosen the right material upon this stone upon this rock I will build my church because I am the rock of Amen. Amen. Rock upon rock. That's why it is impossible to h for us to fail. Amen. Are you are you falling? If you are built upon a stone, then that means you are a a rock of ages. As I said, I was talking to a brother in Malawi. We were walking alongside the lake lake and there was a a b what do you call it? Boulders live a huge rock. Now I said to the young man who was talking my friend. Do you see this boulder here? You see this rock? He says yes. Can you tell me how old is this rock? He says, "No, I said now before this rock existed, there was supposed to be a rock of ages." Amen. Amen. That's why we sing Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages left for me. You know at left meaning come rain come what you are under the cliff of the rock. How many times have you like had a dream that maybe one day if maybe turmoil come or no no no no. We are not talking about the coming turmoil. We are talking about the coming eternal one. If then what you are waiting or waiting for is eternal that that means you are eternal. Amen. Because even being eternal, your mind is eternal. Your your your the spirit in you is all right. Amen. Now, that's why there's nothing I can choose beside the one who is eternal. Now if I am not eternal, I cannot choose an eternal one. Are you there? Sometimes you hear they say so and so so and so is no longer coming to church. Why? No, he is griefed. Somebody said this this about he is not eternal. You can never grieve an eternal [Applause] soul. He is eternal. The Lord Jesus was crucified, done everything. Amen. Amen. But he remained eternal. A person who has eternal life, you can never grieve him forever and rever and why? Because he is looking not he doesn't dream of failing. Amen. I say I don't know. I'll just see where God leads me. He has already told me in God. I don't say to me. Amen. Amen. I was a sinner. Now he saved me. He didn't push me back again. Amen. We are going in Jesus is no failure. Amen. Amen. You become who he is. Amen. Amen. He is coming. You are coming. [Applause] Let me read just the last thing. We still need to come to the angels, the pyramid of angels. But let me just read it and close here what we going to uh talk about. The angel was very notable to me. The rest of them just seemed but this one was notable. But this angel was a noted angel just like the message that we have believed is notable to us. Amen. Amen. How can you tell me something different from what I have already received? That's why I cannot say rock of aes for me if things go well. But if something wrong happens, then he's not of ages. Let me finish. And I'm the angel was notable to me. The rest of them just was seemed ordinary. You know when we were coming we were coming this way. There's so many church buildings but they're just ordinary. Amen. Amen. We were looking for the notable Amen. The rest of them. Amen. Amen. We say Jesus, they also say Jesus. You say God, they amen. Amen. But they are not notable. Amen. But there's difference uh between the Jesus and the notable one. All right. Amen. Amen. I promised that this is the last. But the angel was a noted angel. He was to my left in the constellation. in the form of a pyramid. You know, they all come in the form of a pyramid. You'll see even Jerusalem. The prophet tells me in the form of pyramid, the angel of the the pyramid of angels in the form of pyramid Jerusalem in the form of the pyramid. So all is in the form of okay. Amen. Yeah. It was in the pyramid where the mysterious white stone was not written. [Music] took me into that pyramid of themselves. I know this is not a church material. No, the mystery of God known only to them. The things that we have received, they are known only to us. [Applause] Amen. That's right. Then was the messengers had come to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of these seven seals which lays within the pyramid pyramid. [Applause] If somebody tells you no it is not revealed it that's when he is he he's actually saying to you I am not in the pyramid you know the white stone was where in the pyramid in the pyramid now somebody says I don't believe that yes because we are not in the pyramid. [Applause] which lays within the the seven seals, not six, which lays with inside the [Applause] pyramid. The angel was to my left would really be the last or the seventh. Amen. That's why somebody says I don't even believe you say yes because you are not in the pyramid. Amen. If we would count them from left to right, he was on my left. Me looking to him, looking towards worse. Amen. That's why he says I went westward to connect. Amen. Amen. And those to whom the seven seal was revealed they means they went westward. [Applause] westward. Him coming, we'll talk about east and west. Him coming towards the east will be on the left side. That would be the last angel's message. Very notable. Remember how I said is God his head back? his great sharp wings and how he flew right to me. Hallelujah. Each one has an angel. The angel he says flew right to me. Then we are still we we are still going to look who's this angel. And then but now it it says h the secret of this seven seals. How many seals which lays within the pyramid? Anything that is without the pyramid is six and six is the number of men. That's why the the the the seals of the s of a man they end up where six if somebody says I don't believe the seven because you are six cannot believe seven. Amen. Now the angel was to my left would be the last or seventh angel. I don't want to say you don't understand what that what I'm reading about but we are getting to uh where you will understand if we would count them from the left to to right. He was on my left me looking to him. Amen. But no, don't open the the head, open the heart. Yeah. Amen. Because if you open the head, the thing that you are listening to will end up in the head. He was on my me looking to him towards west him. I'm reading this so that next time I can say you remember that him here he is here. Amen. Amen. Amen. Me looking to him towards west coming towards the east would be on the left. Amen. That would be the last angel's message. You know the message that you believe is the message that you are looking at. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Very notable because he is looking at it. He's very notable. How I said he had his you know right in the chair I am not looking at somebody like sometimes if I'm looking at a a man that man can say drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God when arrive home with the family. They are no longer returning to that church. Is there a person who can drink the people they drink? Even the pastors blame somebody. Brother, have you come to church for to blame somebody or for to worship God? So if you worship God, how can you leave God for God? Because you are not a Christian. a Christian doesn't go around blaming people saying when he was saying he was referring to me then you are not a [Applause] Christian to blame somebody he comes to church to worship [Applause] I can't come and sit here only to listen and see. You will hear you will talk about it. You'll hear you are not a Christian. A Christian has come to worship. That's all. He hasn't come to hear what somebody says about you. No. No. No. No, no, no. Let's talk about Jesus. Lastly, he says, that angel, he says he flew right to me. You can also say he flew right to me. You know, a prophet, an angel can come to you in the form of a prophet. Amen. But being an angel coming to you. That's why in closing, have we come to church to listen to who says what about you or who says what about Jesus? Have you heard me say coming to church, you don't come like to listen to somebody? brother smoking talking about me. We haven't come for such jokes if I have done something wrong. I'll be happy to ask for [Applause] mercy. Amen. Somebody finds you with a girlfriend there. And somebody after hearing that he tells somebody that I I I'm afraid to call names because maybe somebody I will call name somebody else I'm not referring to him. Amen. Amen. So brothers in closing I have come here to worship if I have done wrong I don't blame any person I bow down ask for mercy yes amen I don't go around saying no that's not Christianity Christianity. Somebody who fights himself in the wrong bows before God. That is Christianity. We are we don't go around in the church asking for some for for the names of the people who perhaps have said something about me. No, I'm not here for that. I'm here to worship. If I have done anything wrong. Should you come to me and say brother I saw you this this I will say my brother start praying for me. [Applause] I also want to enter. Amen. The Bible says he who hides his sin. What about the person? The Bible is a fool. Yes. We ask to hide yourself. It is like to hide a snake in your [Applause] [Music] pocket. This is the seventh brothers and sisters to be continued the Lord. Amen. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
