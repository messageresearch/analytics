Let me greet everyone in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Let us thank the Lord again this morning for having kept us and gave us an opportunity to come together. It's not everyone who had this opportunity. We will not have this opportunity forever because the prophet has taught us &gt;&gt; that time will come to an end. Amen. We greet you saints. &gt;&gt; Today I'm the local pastor. I'm going to introduce our visitors mainly from Ptoria &gt;&gt; mainly the ones are coming from Ptoria. &gt;&gt; We'll start with &gt;&gt; We have our pastor here. &gt;&gt; Pastor Mua. [applause] We are thankful [cough] &gt;&gt; he's [clears throat] not alone. &gt;&gt; He came together with the elders of the church. &gt;&gt; We have our elder. [applause] We have our elder. [applause] Amen. Now they have also their deacon brother. Brother Murani. [applause] Now just feel free be at home &gt;&gt; and everywhere it praises the more it goes higher the more can see better down here. We also know that &gt;&gt; coming here &gt;&gt; you were brought here by a call. &gt;&gt; The call which is within you. If you have a call within you, there is another call somewhere. That is why you responded to the other call. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say you cannot come unless you have been called. We are thankful. This morning we have two services. This is the first one that has already started &gt;&gt; and [snorts] the second service will start at 14 &gt;&gt; 30. &gt;&gt; Unless unless the elders decide otherwise if they have decided in a different way they will make means to inform us. Now we have come to the point of the word of God. We have our elder &gt;&gt; from Ptorian. &gt;&gt; Elders. [applause] He's the one who's going to minister the word to us so they can give us a worshiing song. to welcome our elder. &gt;&gt; Let me not leave this part out. Our brother here was sister. &gt;&gt; Sister Ma. uh uh brother American Ma &gt;&gt; she's requesting on behalf of brother American Ma whose wife is sick. &gt;&gt; So they are requesting prayers for her. We have [snorts] our elders here who just ask our elder [snorts] to commit this prayer request to the Lord. We have been promised that if you ask you'll be given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; As the pastor said, remind us of the scripture said [clears throat] What we know God the prayer has got no boundaries. Father God is got no border gates when we call upon the name of the Lord. Amen. medication. Oh &gt;&gt; pastor, our pastor Kima has taught us that we have to cast out the generator that is generating that sickness which is the demon that is inside that person. That is why even we are standing here with the authority that God has given unto us you Satan and your devils. We command you in the name of Jesus. We are not here to beg you or to ask you, but we are here as the sons and daughters of God to to chase you out, get out of that body of our sister in the name of Jesus. Father God, we claim the healing of our sister. And we believe, Father God, that our sister, she's been healed. And we thank you Lord for healing her in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; We are thankful. Give us that woriing song as we welcome you. &gt;&gt; We believe that they say we should come to the church having an expectation &gt;&gt; and we receive according to our expectations. If you have a bigger container, you will leave your container being full. If it's a small container, it will also be full to that capacity because God answers [snorts] according to what you requested. That is why you say, ask enough [snorts] so that God can please you. &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the [music] [singing] Let me [music and singing] of God of God should [music] be [singing] [singing] a [music] prophet. Oh, I [singing] sent you [music] [singing] before [music and singing] [singing] he [music] shall The heart [singing] [music] of God [singing] in the heart [singing] of [music] your father.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you all saints in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are all happy. And then we thank the Lord for being with us. &gt;&gt; And then all the way from where we come from from our different places for these services here. May the Lord bless you all. And uh I would also like to thank pastor Maka for uh inviting me &gt;&gt; to to be with him here in this ser in these services. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I've seen Pastor Multo also. May the Lord bless them. and uh for supporting these services too. &gt;&gt; And and our elders from Modi &gt;&gt; and some believers also from Modi who supported Pastor Mua here. May May the Lord bless them. Okay. We will uh pun let's read our scripture on revelation chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Let's read verse uh 1 to 4. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Let's read from verse one up to 4. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look there on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Real speedy. Yes. Let us close our eyes &gt;&gt; and ask to lead us in prayer. forch. Director M. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Uh, pastor has taught me taught taught me that I shouldn't be very long. But I should be precise and to the point before you get tired. And whenever I am here, &gt;&gt; I make sure that I do what Romans do. &gt;&gt; And then actually I've elevated that to uh home. Whenever I preach, I try to be precise and to the point. and then we finish up and close it. So here we usually preach an hour but at times I drink it at times not that I'm going to drink it. I'm still I'm still teaching myself &gt;&gt; to pack everything within that hour. Okay. Fine. Okay. My title here is inheritance and possession and I've got a text. The tax key beware of the delaying process. I'm aware that here is part of I'll be very slow so that our brother must spring the right weight. Beware of the delaying process. &gt;&gt; That is the text. Why am I having the inherit inheritance and and possession and the text of beware of the delaying process? It is because when you are uh about to receive your inheritance, the devil will always try to the delaying tactics so that you could not reach your inheritance. and and possess it. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now, what is an inheritance in our case? Okay. What I'm going to do, sorry, bro. What I'm going to do, I will be in the Old Testament, showing the inheritance. We've got two services today. And then in the in the afternoon, I'll be in the New Testament and show you the relevancy because we have a ministry that is relevant to the time that you are living in. Amen. Okay, we've got the ministry that is relevant to the time that we're living in. And if we ignore that ministry, we will be beating about the bush. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then instead of going to the point, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. We have a ministry that has got an inher inheritance and then we must be able to identify that ministry and stick to that ministry because that is the one that will give us a rapturing faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Last time when I was preaching here I said &gt;&gt; a ser someone can be very nice. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that someone but uh find that now you cannot reach your destination without someone. Uh it's like there's some other food say it's a snack. You won't reach where you are going. You won't you won't be filled. It's a snack. You're waiting for food. Now a a sermon &gt;&gt; that is not relevant. Uh you don't get full because of it. It's a sermon is good. There's nothing wrong with it. But you won't reach your destiny. Amen. &gt;&gt; As believers, &gt;&gt; we are on journey &gt;&gt; we have crossed the river Jordan. &gt;&gt; The Joshua's here has given us inheritance. Now that we have our inheritance, what are we doing with it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that our inheritance is the revelation of the seventh sea. Amen. Now if our inheritance is the revelation of the seven. Now the seventh seal have been revealed when it's revealed. So what? How does it benefit you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to talk about. You've got your inheritance. I was checking the word inheritance. It says inheritance is to receive your asset. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our title is inheritance and possession. Now, inheritance is to receive the asset and possession possession. It's an it's an act of controlling, &gt;&gt; holding, enjoying those assets. If your father gives you a bicycle &gt;&gt; says this is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; That bicycle &gt;&gt; is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you possess it. When you possess it, you start riding it now. You enjoy it now. It's your possession. But inheritance is when you receive it. What are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Inheritance, &gt;&gt; it's when we are positionally placed, right? Amen. And then you given that inheritance. Now we need to enjoy it. Now look at the enjoyment. If you read &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 10, verse 8, &gt;&gt; verse eight, &gt;&gt; you'll see how we enjoy our our our inheritance. Can you read it my brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." &gt;&gt; Continue. &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the book. And he said unto me, take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. &gt;&gt; You see how we're going to enjoy that book, that inheritance, but we'll come and explain that. So, let me go to the Old Testament, uh, Numbers chapter 32. I just want you to to understand what I'm going to talk about. I was just laying a foundation. &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to uh the book of numbers. &gt;&gt; Uh uh let's read verse chapter 32. &gt;&gt; Numbers 32. &gt;&gt; Let's start with verse 6. &gt;&gt; Verse six. And Moses said unto the children of God, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them. Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Gadesh Banana to see the land. &gt;&gt; And can you go to verse 13? &gt;&gt; Verse 13. &gt;&gt; And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel. And he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years until all the generations that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed. So they were from Egypt to their promised land where they need to have their uh inheritance. Amen. I understand they were supposed to take 40 days. You'll correct me. You'll correct me. But they took 40 &gt;&gt; years. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that's why my text says beware of the delaying process. On their way there were some delaying process. Whenever I I'm speaking about this Old Testament, you always transfer it to the New Testament. But but stick to the relevant ministry. Are we together? There was some delaying process and then you check on your side. What is the delaying process in the time that you are living in? Remember the Old Testament is the shadow of the New Testament. The Bible says, "And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander IN THE WILDERNESS. FOR 40 DAYS. But coming to us, it has to do with a finished work. It has to do with the lamb's book of life. It's a complete job. All those their names are found in that book. They will never be delayed. by the demonic tactics &gt;&gt; because it's it's a finished work, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. So he made them wander in the wilderness for 40 years until all the generations that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed. Now there was a a house of Gad and Reuben and Manas and the half tribe of manas actually the Bible speak it as a two and a half tribe the tribe of manas I mean the tribe of Reuben the tribe of and half of manas. &gt;&gt; They went to Moses &gt;&gt; and said to Moses, &gt;&gt; we see that place is it's there's a place they name it. I'll get you the scripture which is good for our cattle. &gt;&gt; But that place is not beyond It's not beyond Jordan. It's on this side. They were supposed to cross Jordan. And that place was very fatile. Then they went to Moses and said, "Uh, can we be on the other side of the road? We don't want to cross that side because there's a grazing place. That is why now in verse uh 6 326, &gt;&gt; Moses said unto the children of God and to the children of Reuben, &gt;&gt; shall your brethren go to war, and you shall sit here. In verse 27, it says, &gt;&gt; verse 27, &gt;&gt; "And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel, from going over into the land which the Lord has given them." The Lord has given them and you are discouraging them. Because you are a team, you need to fight as the 12 tribes of Israel. &gt;&gt; And once you don't do that, &gt;&gt; you are discouraging. Exactly. &gt;&gt; H your brothers, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. I want also also to check on numbers 33 verse 54. &gt;&gt; Verse 54. &gt;&gt; I will explain that in the afternoon. &gt;&gt; All right. Verse 54. Can you read? &gt;&gt; And he shall divide &gt;&gt; up to up to 5. Let me see. Up to 55. My prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families, and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance. Every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lord fleth. According to the tribes of your fathers, he shall inherit. But if you will not drive out the inheritance of the land from before. But if you will not drive out the inheritance of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricked in your eyes, &gt;&gt; and thorns in your sight, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 56 &gt;&gt; Moreover, it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them. &gt;&gt; Right now, &gt;&gt; slowly, let's go on. So here you you hear there's a promise that they must cross over and when they cross over they shall divide the land accordingly. The the Bible says here they shall divide the land the land by Lord. In other words, there should be no bias about it when they allocate. It must not be a bias because when they were born, their place was identified. Remember that we were in him. our place identified in him. And you should remember also that if you go to Deuteronomy 32 &gt;&gt; and verse 4, &gt;&gt; verse four, &gt;&gt; it says he is a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 18, &gt;&gt; verse 18, &gt;&gt; it says now You've got it. Just read verse 4 and 18. Listen carefully. &gt;&gt; He is the rock. His work is perfect. For all his ways are judgment. A God of truth and without iniquity. Just and right is he. &gt;&gt; He is a rock, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 18. of the rock that begat thee, thou art unmindful, and has forgotten God that formed thee. You are ducked out of that rock and now you are unmindful. Are we together? Amen. Now it doesn't work like that. If we are from that road, everybody is positioned in that role. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When uh uh um who's that brother that had a dream about the &gt;&gt; the pyramid? &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson. &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson. &gt;&gt; Brother Junior Jackson &gt;&gt; saw brother. &gt;&gt; I mean as saw the pyramid pyramid. It was a rock. He explained that. Brother explained that the dream of brother Junior Jackson, &gt;&gt; it was a rock. And if it was a rock, &gt;&gt; remember, brother Brenam, &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham speaks about the cornerstone of which the pastor also mentions. The cornerstone is down there. But that cornerstone now became now a capstone. But as it goes up, everybody is patched up positionally in all the church ages. The bride is not only in the church. No, the bride started from Ephesus. &gt;&gt; That is a stone. &gt;&gt; Another one. &gt;&gt; Ephesis, &gt;&gt; Pergamos, &gt;&gt; Philadelphia, I'm inside Philadelphia and those are little stone that builds the pyramid. Pyramid. Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is no one that will miss his position. There is not a bride that will miss the position. And when the capstone came to cap it is to adopt the whole thing. So now your inheritance you'll be allotted without being a bias allocation. Everybody will get what belongs to him and and will be satisfied about what comes uh uh h to him. That's why now it says here inheritistance is to receiving your assets while possession and possession possession is a act of actually holding controlling and enjoying those because it's a full benefit of your inheritance. So we think of inheritance as being given the deed. When you're given the deed that is your inheritance while position is being is is having is I mean is living in and and using that househance I mean inheritance you are given the deed but possession we are in and using that. Let me quote what brother Brennham says. &gt;&gt; Israel and the church paragraph 85. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 85. &gt;&gt; We are living in the last days, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are here at the end of the road. Thank God for some Calebs and Joshua's that ready to go over go over and bring back the evidence. It's a great land. bringing back two bunches of grapes and they were walking like this to try to pack it. What a ground. What a place. Thank God for people who crossed over. Amen. Right. Amen. So now crossing over is crossing over from the church ages to the to the seals crossing over from the book of life to the lamb's book of life will will will touch that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it says God will raise up a new system. I'm reading this uh book as I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; I didn't write the the paragraph. Maybe it could be paragraph 41. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will raise up a new system called interdenominational system. by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land. When you worship, when you fellowship, you must know that you are on a chain. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are we are we are moving. from one point to another. &gt;&gt; So God will raise up a new system, interdenominational system by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land. That's what we are. That's what the ministry want that we let us go. It &gt;&gt; it should not be a stagnant ministry. We need to be jealous of our ministry. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to see it that it carries what we want. And we need to feel it. We need to hear it &gt;&gt; and we need to understand it &gt;&gt; and we need to be part of it. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That will take take the church into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Organizations and denominations has messed it up. Each one after the their own theology, each one after their own way of thinking. But God will take his Holy Spirit and he will raise up his Joshua that will take the church to the promise with no denominational string ties anywhere but will take over his church. Amen. It says Moses was a lawgiver. &gt;&gt; Joshua was called of grace and he took the church on. Moses &gt;&gt; was a lawgiver, gave them the law. But when Joshua came, he took the church on He let it he let it move. He crossed over. He met a cherub with a with a sword. &gt;&gt; And then he he had an anointing of that cherub. Now the church must move until it meets the cherub. Because when they lose their inheritance, there was a cherub that was set on their state on their place was a cherub. It says so when mo when when Adam and Eve were ousted out of the garden of Eden and then there was a cherub that had a sword and now to guard the way to the tree of life. Right now, you can't go to the tree of life without having met that cherub. Remember that cherub had a sword. Are we together? When Joshua cross over, he met a cherub with a sword. When brother Brenham was praying, he received that sword. Are we together? &gt;&gt; What happened to that sword? &gt;&gt; Go and look in your wardrobe. You'll find it. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the word of God. It's like a double doubleged sword. And when when it was given to brother Brennan Brennan, &gt;&gt; it was said the sword of a king and then he said the sword of the king &gt;&gt; is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? We will come to that in the afternoon. Moses was a lawgiver. Joshua &gt;&gt; was called of grace. He took the church off. If you go to paragraph 42 in the same book, &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses, &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses, &gt;&gt; the prophet says, &gt;&gt; we find also that Joshua knowing this core mission. You must remember brother Brennham Brennham &gt;&gt; had a commission. &gt;&gt; But there was there was another time where he received a new commission, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had his own rue. It say the Bible says &gt;&gt; in uh Matthew 17 &gt;&gt; in verse 11 it says &gt;&gt; can can you read it? Matthew 17 Matthew 17 says &gt;&gt; verse verse verse 11 my prayer. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come and restore all things. &gt;&gt; Right? He shall first come Elijah &gt;&gt; and restore things. &gt;&gt; We know about all the restoration. After the restoration, the ministry changed. There was a ministry of restoration back to the foundations of the prophets and apostles. &gt;&gt; And then after restoration, then the ministry changes because it is the Holy Ghost building the church and then it was dismantled. like we've said the Pentecostals and then God sent brother Brennan &gt;&gt; to restore everything you know Elijah when Israel &gt;&gt; was mixed up with the teachings of the false prophet then he challenged them &gt;&gt; said let's make a sacrifice And then you call fire from heaven to burn the sacrifice. I will also make my own then called the fire. You know what he did? After they failed, he restored everything. many took out their their what they have made their ark and then Elijah put his own &gt;&gt; and restored everything according to order. If everything is according to order, there's no way that God could not answer it. Brother says, &gt;&gt; "If you want to corner God, corner him on his promises because he will never shift from his promises." &gt;&gt; If the ministry is in line with the word of God, &gt;&gt; you don't struggle. you got because it it is of God &gt;&gt; and even when you present it you don't even shout people and SAY no you don't you don't because they are part of that and they attracted of that you're just reminding Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, paragraph 42 says, &gt;&gt; "We find also that Joshua knowing his commission, knowing that it laid in his hand that God had called him for a duty that he must not fail. God can never call a bride that is scared of failing. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are the bride, &gt;&gt; you are the word. &gt;&gt; The word cannot fade. There's nothing that will scare you &gt;&gt; if if there is any MINISTRY &gt;&gt; that can over derail the the the right ministry then it will be contradiction. God set out the right ministry. He's duty bound to support that ministry. As long as we move with it as the baton was with Moses. Moses gave it over to Joshua. Amen. And the B and the the prophet says the Joshua &gt;&gt; knowing this commission the bride knows their commission knowing that it is laid in his hand. He is responsible. The wedge is now in the bride. [applause and cheering] That makes that makes you responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It right that laid in his hand and that God had called him for a duty that he must not fail. Look, if it's God that has given me a duty, I'd be very happy. &gt;&gt; I know that now his word can never fail. And if his word CAN NEVER FAIL AND THEN HE USES ME, I'LL BE PROUD OF my God. Amen. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; And then he says he walked softly before God. &gt;&gt; Just like Enoch walked softly before God just like Abraham. Abraham walk softly until he became God himself. He walked softly. Bible says he walked with God, communicated with God as they were communicating. They found each other. We are of the same rod. When Peter met Jesus, they started communicating. They're of the same rock, &gt;&gt; right? He is the rock. If he's a rock, little stone Peter, you come out of that rock. And when you come out of that, when you start communing with him, walking with him is communing with him. That's why brother Brandham said, "Have you met?" Because Abraham COMMUNICATED WITH GOD IN THEIR COMMUNICATION. Abraham found his position in that ROCK and all AND ALL AND ALL. HE PAUL FOUND HIS POSITION and when HE FOUND HIS POSITION there was no more turning back. HE WILL FIGHT UNTIL HE SAYS I HAVE ATTAINED. I even know myself in heaven right inside heaven. I SAW myself there. I kept quiet for 40 YEARS BECAUSE NOBODY CAN BELIEVE ME. THAT IS WHY says when the seventh seat opened it was silence. &gt;&gt; Who can believe you? If you say to him, I was in Mount Transfiguration. I saw this man which is called Jesus transformed &gt;&gt; and he was with Moses and he was with Elijah. They will say no you are out of your mind. So the best is to keep quiet. Why did brother Brennan after God has opened up the seven seal then he took to reveal them? Brother Brenham revealed them. Why did he say &gt;&gt; it is in me? Amen. &gt;&gt; He never tried to explain. &gt;&gt; No, he said I feel checked. I've explained I've explained the first pool. I've explained the second pool. This one it's my revelation. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And why did he say the word is now in the bride and the bride knows what to DO ABOUT IT? Because God thus said the Lord. You can read the book of seals especially the seventh seal. I want to understand when when we reach a point where we say yeah there it is now. There it is now. There it is. Now then you would say I think I must stop here. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because you each and every one of you have to walk with God until he finds himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua &gt;&gt; said his duty that he must not fail. That is why our pastor made sure before he departed that he must not fail. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. He was sure of him. He walked softly before God. And Joshua when he called the people together and told them that God had commissioned him, watch the request of the people. They said, "We'll follow you as we did Moses. If we can see the same thing that followed Moses, it doesn't have to be a person. It has to be the thing that that is in him. Not not a person. Now they are not looking at Joshua as such. They looking at the thing that was in Moses. They can't take any other thing. But they said to him, &gt;&gt; only be strong and courageous. You cannot do the right thing when you are scared. When you don't have courage, when you know that what you're doing is right, that that thing makes you strong, that makes you courageous because we know that you have the eternal thing. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So now what is our inheritance &gt;&gt; and uh uh how did we lost it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says here &gt;&gt; uh the bridge between the seven church ages and the seven saints. It says Adam lost his inheritance. Adam lost his inheritance. He's our father. He's our grandparent. He lost it. It is supposed to be ours. When your father has got something, know that it's your inheritance. And if he mess up with that, &gt;&gt; there's nothing that you're going to inherit because your father mess it up. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, our great great parents He says Adam lo what is that inheritance? &gt;&gt; Adam lost his inheritance. &gt;&gt; The earth the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now it passed from his hand to the one he sold to the other one. &gt;&gt; He sold out to Satan. We are the inheritance of this earth. I will explain. He sold his faith in God's Yeah. He sold his faith in God to No. No. He Yeah. Yeah. He He sold his faith in God. Now he sold it to &gt;&gt; Satan. Amen. He was supposed to have faith in God, but he sold it &gt;&gt; to the devil. Therefore, his eternal life His right to the tree of life, his right to the earth that belonged to him. And he forated every to the hands of Satan, his right to eternal life. &gt;&gt; His right to the tree of life. his right &gt;&gt; to the earth. &gt;&gt; Those things belong to him. &gt;&gt; And he forfeated every bit to the hands of the devil. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So now where where is our inheritance? Was in the hands of the devil. He passeth from his hand to the devil. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, now &gt;&gt; it has been it has sorry it has been it returned and he has been polluted &gt;&gt; and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had. That's the earth. That's the seed of Adam. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you read this book, &gt;&gt; uh, the Revelation chapter 5 part two, &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 part two, &gt;&gt; paragraph 73. Remember it's an old testament but we're going to explain that that thing now he lost everything and remember our title has to do with the inheritance and possession and at the same time our our text beware of the delaying process Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Paragraph uh where I said we're reading from Yeah. paragraph 73 says &gt;&gt; the next few weeks. All right. So right the next few weeks of teaching will be based upon redemption. That's brother saying that. It says, see, upon redemption, not upon justification, &gt;&gt; not not upon justification. It's based on redemption. Redeeming what is yours, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Not upon mediatoral. of intercession but upon redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any inheritance that was lost or for fated and has been redeemed back to us. AMEN. Has returned back to us again. and how it all come about and how God planned it before there ever was a WORLD and how secure the church is anchored. That's what he says. This shows how secured &gt;&gt; the church anchor. &gt;&gt; I think it come to a time when we got to know how we stand. Are we together? Amen. It's come a time where one have to know where we stand. &gt;&gt; And how can we do anything unless you've got faith in what you are doing where you stand there's nothing that you can do if you don't have faith on what you are doing. You got to have faith. And that's my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the believers faith, &gt;&gt; confidence on what they are standing for because it is the word of the Lord. Now if it's the word of the Lord, Now he says now must give the believers faith on what they believe and what they are standing on because that is the way this as long as through the scriptures sovereignty please it is the sovereign placed by scripture. from Genesis to Revelation, back and forth, up and down, and a way for the devil to move and not a way for the devil to move in there anywhere. Amen. He says from Genesis to Revelation up down and everything there is no way as long as it is the sovereignty of the word and that sovereignty of the word we take it by faith. There is no intervention. There is no incarnation. But the devil intervened when one has got a doubt in the word of God. That's how we lost our inheritance. The Lord said, "Let us make man in our image." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, &gt;&gt; he didn't say, "Let us make amen." &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us make men." &gt;&gt; That man that he said we should make, he must he said that man, &gt;&gt; male and female created he them. Then he said, "God will CALL HIS CHILDREN FROM THE DUST of the earth." NOW &gt;&gt; THAT is the man &gt;&gt; that he spoke about before he made man out of the dust of the earth. You know, if if if if you read the book of Ezekiel 28, you'll find him speaking about the garden of Eden in heaven. Now, everything was done in heaven. Here on earth, it's just those things that are manifested. All those things were in the mind of course but that's how it is. &gt;&gt; So then he says here what I was reading here &gt;&gt; now the for fated title deed is now in the hands of the original owner. Remember we read uh Revelation 5 verse one. We will go to that one. But but what is going on here? You have to be careful. We are talking about losing the earth and the way to the tree of life etc etc. But the title did went back to the owner. Yes, we lost it. But it was not in the dirty hands of the devil. We lost the earth. We lost the the tree of life. Going to the tree of life. But the title did. Okay, let me read that one. Amen. He says uh uh paragraph 116. &gt;&gt; He says sorry now therefore faith that titled deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God. the title did to the earth and to eternal life. When Adam forfeated it, then Satan's dirty hands could not take it. It went back to the original owner, God himself. He says, "Now, we're going to find it back in a minute. Right. Verse paragraph 117. &gt;&gt; What is it doing in the hands of God? &gt;&gt; In the hands of God, waiting for the redemption claim. Remember, I'm talking about a thing that has already happened. That's why I went back to the I mean to the Old Testament. So it says now God is waiting for the claim &gt;&gt; of which it has already done. &gt;&gt; He made a way of redemption. He made a way back in some someday the redeemer is to take it back. Remember he has already taken it back. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when when when he was saying these things, the seals were not yet open. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 1 118 says, "What is the book of redemption? This title did the abstract title did There's a title deed. There is an abstract title. Amen. A title D. We already know what is it. When you've got your title D of your house, it doesn't tell you the story, &gt;&gt; but the abstract It will tell you that house was the first owner was the second one was kosana. The third one was &gt;&gt; that is the abstract says now &gt;&gt; uh Satan's dead hand could not take it. It went back to the original. Now in 118 it says now what is the book of redemption? This title did abstract title corrects IT &gt;&gt; and he says you say abstract abstract. &gt;&gt; What does an abstract mean? It means it's such all the way back to the beginningise. like that. Like like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck the bleach, it went all the way back. And when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ, it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator. I'm about to close as I've said now I'm just laying on that one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then it's legal position to the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost. The position of that deed Are &gt;&gt; we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's redemption. And it redemption means all legal position. All that was lost by Adam. What that ought to do, you have to start by being born again. Then that gives you a legal position to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that title deed of eternal life. Imagine. Amen. Title date of eternal life. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now when we speak about Joshua's &gt;&gt; giving us our inheritance, we're getting our eternal life and then we rest assure. So it's just that now you cannot say to somebody go and peep to heaven and come back. &gt;&gt; But if you can just take somebody and say let him peep and come back will never be the same. And it it's just that now you cannot say can you just peep the other side of death then come back you'll tell us another story. I went and peeped by his grace I find that whatever is happening here it's none and void. There's nothing that is yours here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. Just by peeping and coming back. I didn't even know how to repent. Didn't know how to repent. And even when I repented, I was not sure whether I'm waiting for it. That's what now our Joshua's are restoring to us. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's nothing here on earth that belongs to us. &gt;&gt; The devil is in possession. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But our inheritance belongs to us. Let me read you that one. and our inheritance belong to us. It's your privilege to have anything that you inherited. It's your privilege. Adam forfeated the title to Satan. Now in that fall, &gt;&gt; Adam fored the title to that. &gt;&gt; He forfeated to Satan. Satan and Adam was very slothful and he did not redeem his rights for he could he could not redeem his right. Satan &gt;&gt; is the god of this earth. Go and read it. Luke chapter 4 &gt;&gt; verse 57 verse 5-7. &gt;&gt; He is the God of this earth. But ours is not this one, &gt;&gt; not this one. Read it, my brother. Luke chapter 4 verse 5. And the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, "All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me." &gt;&gt; Is delivered unto me. &gt;&gt; Who delivered it to the devil? It's Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can stand before God and challenge him. &gt;&gt; It was given to me. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. I I got it from Adam. You said, multiply, apprentice the land. He didn't believe you. Now I said you were not telling the truth. So no, he believed me instead of you. &gt;&gt; So it's given to me. &gt;&gt; He can claim it. &gt;&gt; Right? Satan is the god of this earth. &gt;&gt; But Satan does not rightfully own it. &gt;&gt; But he possesses He is the God of the earth. That's what the Bible says. Are &gt;&gt; we together? &gt;&gt; He said it's given to me. Now do you get Satan possessed that? He holds it in his hand. Death in his hand. Death in his hand. the earth in his hand. &gt;&gt; The world belongs to him. &gt;&gt; The earth and the world, you know, every nation belongs to him. He governs. He controls the whole world and everything in the world. But &gt;&gt; thank God. &gt;&gt; We are not of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't mean the church. He doesn't control the church. He controls the world. He he said they were his &gt;&gt; and he's the god of the world. &gt;&gt; You know that he said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he for Adam forfeated the title did but when he forfeated it went to God. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. So but we own it &gt;&gt; right now. Now our ministry now as you would see in the afternoon uh we our title did come back to us as a ministry as the word of God and as an assurance. That is why we are the bride. We are the one. Look, brother Brennham says &gt;&gt; Adam, our first Adam had a bride. before he could know the bride, the bride was already pregnant. The second Adam which is Jesus had a church. &gt;&gt; Before he could adopt that church, it was already pregnant with dogmas, wrong doctrine. That's why he he left it and came to you and the the the the the group that is elected for a good purpose. That's what makes you a bride. Not a church. Then he marries you. That is why he said the word is now in the bride. We are married by him. because you had faith in the word it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now in closing I am saying there is a ministry that is relevant and if that ministry is relevant any other ministry It's in vain. &gt;&gt; It's a sermon. &gt;&gt; It's a ministry. &gt;&gt; It has got its own doctrine. It has it its own anointing. But you can't reach your destination. The at the moment the ministry is of the revealed way and the revealed way is nothing else. Christ himself. And if Christ him is a revealed way, that's what will give you a rapture because it's himself that will find a place in your heart. When you find a place in your he will whisper to you as an individual. And when you whisper to you as an individual, you are the only one that will be convinced. There's nobody else that can convince him. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are the only one that will be convinced by the whispering. As I've already said that, brother Brennham said, "Have you met me?" He said I have met. That is why he says now who is this mec in other words he was say I am that mec and then you can be that who is meedced is Christed. You are Christ because in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word is God. And that word came and put on a flesh &gt;&gt; and became man. That is it. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. You can come. God bless you. Thanks. Would you see more?
