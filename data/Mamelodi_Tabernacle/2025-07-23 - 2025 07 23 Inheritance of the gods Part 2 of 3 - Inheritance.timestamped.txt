[0:03] [Music]
[0:32] Make sure that the road you have is
[0:35] God's role.
[0:41] Amen.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; That
[0:47] was a miracle worker.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Moses made sure that
[0:53] he had a rod in possession
[0:56] because that rod was responsible
[1:00] for opening of the sea.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08] Elijah knew it.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; He had the mantle.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Elisha knew it. The church.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; She had the mental
[1:24] now. She I mean church now.
[1:28] He knew that without that mental
[1:32] he would never perform.
[1:36] He will only reside.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; So
[1:45] he put his son
[1:47] &gt;&gt; Adam and bride in that headquarters.
[1:53] So Adam was in the headquarters.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59] Then what happened?
[2:02] &gt;&gt; And uh there was this man
[2:06] without the garden,
[2:11] &gt;&gt; a revivalist,
[2:17] &gt;&gt; he had his open air meeting there.
[2:24] So because now
[2:27] the the the headquarters were well
[2:29] guarded.
[2:33] So he he just walked around
[2:36] this way and that way.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; He would look at Adam.
[2:42] He was blinded because that was the
[2:46] original seat.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he would move down up there
[2:56] and checking.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he's doing that like a
[3:06] lion
[3:11] &gt;&gt; of the tribe of Cain.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Remember even when you are asleep
[3:25] &gt;&gt; the devil is just
[3:28] about
[3:34] &gt;&gt; but the pillar of light is there.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; He won't touch you.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; So
[3:48] &gt;&gt; that was the garden of Eden.
[3:51] Adam meant that place.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; He was a god there.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; So now the serpent,
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Lucifer's prophet.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; So it came there
[4:11] came there.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] and
[4:19] until
[4:22] &gt;&gt; the church
[4:24] &gt;&gt; was found being alone.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Naturally, you know that
[4:35] if a woman goes down the street alone,
[4:39] you know that whistling whistling
[4:45] hell.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; But if she happens to go down to be
[4:54] going down with her husband,
[4:57] &gt;&gt; do you hear any whistling?
[5:02] Amen.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; The serpent will always wait for a
[5:05] chance
[5:10] to find her alone.
[5:16] Don't worry, sister. You say I'm single.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; You say I'm single.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; No, you are married to Christ.
[5:27] [Applause]
[5:28] Amen.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about natural things
[5:32] outside.
[5:37] Even brother Brennham says
[5:40] you are not seeing it.
[5:43] The pastor is your husband.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; But I mean spiritually.
[5:53] [Music]
[5:55] [Applause]
[5:58] &gt;&gt; So in Christ you are not single.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; If you are not yet married,
[6:10] &gt;&gt; your marriage is coming.
[6:15] They that wait upon the Lord,
[6:19] &gt;&gt; they shall receive
[6:22] the their marriage
[6:24] and their blessings.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord.
[6:31] Waiting upon the Lord
[6:34] means gaining experience in God.
[6:40] The more you wait, the more you are
[6:42] spiritually.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; For you you you have to keep your title
[6:56] a young man, a young woman.
[7:01] I said this in Botswana. to remember
[7:05] how to be a Christian
[7:09] is to be a champion.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Now a champion
[7:19] harder than any other
[7:24] if we talk of boxing boxer
[7:28] &gt;&gt; because all the other boxers
[7:32] are they want that belt
[7:35] &gt;&gt; they are looking at the belt
[7:39] &gt;&gt; your belt
[7:40] once you are a Christian
[7:44] that means you are a champion
[7:47] of all hell and the demons
[7:52] looking at the belt
[7:58] at your belt
[8:00] now After you have won,
[8:04] then you must keep.
[8:10] Some people sometimes they score and win
[8:15] to lose it again
[8:20] and say, you know, I used to rejoice in
[8:22] the Lord. You know, I used to
[8:26] the the prophet says, God don't have
[8:28] exchildren.
[8:29] [Music]
[8:33] Once a child of God,
[8:36] you're a child of God.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; And the Bible puts it better than me.
[8:49] It says we are more than conquerors.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; That means that there's con there is
[8:58] some conquerors.
[9:00] But the Bible says we are more than
[9:02] that.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; We don't even consider that level
[9:11] for we are more than that
[9:15] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[9:21] Amen.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:22] So a champion
[9:25] [Music]
[9:27] &gt;&gt; he sweats day and night to retain
[9:35] that's a Christian
[9:39] day and night
[9:42] she or he fights to retain
[9:47] &gt;&gt; the belt is
[9:52] Let's look at these gods now.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; So now after
[10:01] Satan m the system
[10:06] the prophet now says
[10:10] then there was a gap.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Can I read that part again pastor?
[10:20] Then there was a game.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; The past partner was no longer in his
[10:28] position.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Then it caused God
[10:38] to make a plan.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Plan for what
[10:46] now? Our position
[10:50] is not just to quit smoking and
[10:55] that is nothing.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; When you were born you were not smoking.
[11:05] You are not drinking.
[11:08] So
[11:09] to quit smoking and drinking is nothing
[11:14] compared to the quality that we are made
[11:16] of.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; It is like
[11:24] maybe you are smoking
[11:27] and somebody tells you that you are a
[11:30] child of God
[11:32] you are a child of God. Then you say,
[11:34] "Oh, sorry.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; It's nothing.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; When you were born, you are not
[11:43] smoking."
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Now, if sometimes
[11:50] in the denomination,
[11:53] a person comes and quits smoking,
[11:56] then he says,
[12:00] "No, she's he's just a non-smoker.
[12:10] The devil is so cunning. He knows the
[12:12] levels.
[12:15] We are we are not nonsmokers and non
[12:18] drinkers.
[12:26] Amen.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Sometimes people take the
[12:30] word of God to be a good policy.
[12:38] Just a good policy,
[12:41] not really what it meant."
[12:46] Amen.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; The word of God came to make us God.
[12:56] But
[12:57] &gt;&gt; let me reverse this.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; The word of God
[13:05] &gt;&gt; came to confirm
[13:11] because brother Brennham says
[13:14] have eternal life
[13:16] always ahead.
[13:23] He says only
[13:25] it's like this.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe I've got the book here.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Who is this mechisedc?
[13:38] Let me read this partage 11.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Those who have tonight eternal life. No,
[13:46] no, this morning. Those who have this
[13:49] morning eternal life
[13:52] were with him
[13:55] and in his mind
[13:58] before there was an angel
[14:01] star or cherub
[14:06] that's why we are going there. When Adam
[14:09] left the place,
[14:12] &gt;&gt; the cherubim
[14:14] stood guard there
[14:19] guarding the way of the tree of
[14:24] now. We all know that the place belong
[14:28] to Adam.
[14:31] But after God drove them out,
[14:35] he put
[14:37] cherabim with a sword
[14:41] to guard the way of the tree of life.
[14:49] Now I know that this morning
[14:52] God gave back.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; God
[14:59] brought
[15:01] Amen.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; The man
[15:05] &gt;&gt; to the place
[15:07] [Music]
[15:09] says
[15:12] &gt;&gt; we have seven angels
[15:17] leading back to the garden of Eden.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Now you come to the seventh.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; He's standing there with a sword.
[15:31] Amen.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Now you are looking at this thing
[15:40] geographically.
[15:43] Leave it geographically.
[15:45] The cherubims were there.
[15:48] But today,
[15:51] God gave the end time messenger
[16:00] and said this is the sword of the king.
[16:04] Now we can say every time you see the
[16:07] source man
[16:11] you should know that behind that source
[16:12] man
[16:14] is God's mysteries.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; So he restored that.
[16:25] Let's come down this way.
[16:29] H I'm reading this part here.
[16:34] Oh yeah. Yeah. Uh who is this Melkisedc?
[16:38] &gt;&gt; The prophet says something here.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Uh he says
[16:45] &gt;&gt; look
[16:47] unless you you are a thought
[16:53] at the beginning for he says you can't
[16:56] be a word unless you were
[17:05] Then it solves our pro our problems.
[17:10] You can't be
[17:13] a word
[17:14] unless you were a thought.
[17:21] So it solves our problems.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; The people don't believe because the
[17:26] prophet says they were not there.
[17:33] they were not in his.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brenham says
[17:42] some of the things were not there
[17:48] you know how they came as plagues and
[17:50] what else
[17:54] thorns were not there
[17:57] but after sin
[17:59] thorns started to
[18:06] &gt;&gt; and he says in the garden in the field
[18:10] they so much looked alike
[18:15] some were not planted by the father
[18:20] they will be
[18:22] rooted
[18:25] they were not
[18:30] So my problem is solved today.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; I believe because I was there.
[18:39] You believe
[18:41] because you were
[18:48] [Music]
[18:50] that proves the predestinated of God.
[18:57] You can't be the word unless you are a
[18:59] thought.
[19:04] But you see, in order to stand
[19:06] temptation,
[19:09] you had to bypass the theophony.
[19:14] You had to come down here.
[19:17] Now, brother Brennham says
[19:19] &gt;&gt; this theophony
[19:22] that's where we lived before.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then God,
[19:32] he had to bring us down here
[19:36] to bypass our theophony,
[19:39] come down here in flesh
[19:42] to be tempted.
[19:49] And now
[19:51] although I don't have the papers here
[19:54] but I can say
[19:57] let me look at this.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Now he says
[20:05] let me just quote it.
[20:09] You are here in the negative
[20:14] showing that
[20:16] if there is a negative
[20:19] show that somewhere there's a positive
[20:25] this body is the negative.
[20:29] You can read it. Masterpiece page three.
[20:34] We realize that
[20:36] we are here in the negative.
[20:40] and realizing that if there's a negative
[20:44] positive
[20:48] and if you process the negative
[20:54] positive
[20:58] now this also can solve
[21:01] this solved my problem.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. For it says,
[21:09] &gt;&gt; yeah, I've got this part here,
[21:15] &gt;&gt; the negative.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; There has to be an object somewhere.
[21:22] When the light strikes that lens
[21:29] and uh so I'll take it from here. So
[21:33] when we see
[21:35] that our life here
[21:38] is in the negative
[21:41] and knowing that we are in the image of
[21:45] some life somewhere
[21:50] for the prophet says each and every one
[21:52] of us
[21:54] is influenced
[21:58] from up or from down.
[22:05] from up or from beneath.
[22:09] We are all being influenced.
[22:14] What influences you
[22:17] just to think of God and one God all the
[22:20] time?
[22:22] Something from above.
[22:27] And what influences somebody
[22:31] just to to be after sin,
[22:34] something from beneath?
[22:37] We are influenced from.
[22:42] So he says that we know that there is a
[22:46] positive somewhere
[22:50] somewhere beyond the blue
[22:54] for me. Amen. And the light has struck
[22:57] and it reflect something here
[23:02] and we are only that reflection.
[23:06] A genuine object is somewhere.
[23:11] Amen. Can we say amen to that?
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says
[23:19] &gt;&gt; after the fall,
[23:22] &gt;&gt; I asked the pastor to read this again.
[23:25] What happened after the fall?
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Then Adam left a gap.
[23:34] Now we can understand all this about
[23:36] standing in the gap.
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] Adam left a gap there.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; It cost God
[23:50] something
[23:52] &gt;&gt; because one part
[23:56] left the place.
[24:00] He had to come through the laws.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; And all these shadows and so forth.
[24:09] in order to bring it back again.
[24:14] The whole ministry
[24:18] bring Adam back to them
[24:22] where God would be
[24:25] able again
[24:28] to run his
[24:34] Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:37] If if maybe
[24:41] your radio
[24:44] maybe you don't hear from the studio
[24:49] blame the studio it's your radio
[24:59] you turn on
[25:06] And you see now you see those people
[25:07] now.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; It's not the studio. It's your radio.
[25:16] Now what you need to fix,
[25:20] &gt;&gt; the receiver here, your radio.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; So that's why God, he knew that the
[25:28] problem is not with the studio,
[25:32] &gt;&gt; but with the receiver down there.
[25:34] receiver.
[25:37] So he came back,
[25:40] fixed the receiver.
[25:43] Then after he fixed the receiver,
[25:46] he went back and started again.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; You know, he tried it there with seven
[25:55] church ages.
[26:05] And the seventh man
[26:08] &gt;&gt; received the receiver
[26:11] receiver.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; And the Lord started again.
[26:15] Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; It's working now.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; The first church age is
[26:30] Amen.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; He was receiving a response now.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; How how many are here?
[26:44] [Music]
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Now
[26:50] the the prophet says, "I've got this
[26:52] book again.
[26:56] Tomorrow I'm going to read it again.
[27:00] Now this great chain of perfection
[27:04] was broken.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; The chain of perfection.
[27:14] God on this side,
[27:16] another God on that side.
[27:18] One side was broken
[27:24] &gt;&gt; and the studio.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:30] [Music]
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Broadcast
[27:38] was still broadcasting
[27:42] and there was the receiver was quiet.
[27:52] Amen.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; All quiet there.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Where are you?
[28:06] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't hear you.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Where are you?
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Finally, he cornered him.
[28:19] And he said,
[28:22] &gt;&gt; "It's this
[28:24] woman."
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; She made me quit the post.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; And remember,
[28:38] &gt;&gt; God never made arguments with Adam.
[28:44] He said, "It's this woman.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; He made me to do it."
[28:51] &gt;&gt; And God never made an argument.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Then he said,
[28:57] &gt;&gt; "Okay, woman
[29:01] is the serpent."
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they were pointing behind them.
[29:13] Is this woman? The woman says is this
[29:17] serpent?
[29:20] And God never said anything to the
[29:22] serpent.
[29:25] He never asked him anything. He knew
[29:27] that he was going to tell lies.
[29:33] Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:41] He only ex executed judgment on him
[29:49] &gt;&gt; from today.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; The sentence is
[29:53] your legs will be chopped off.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; I won't kill you.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; I will only you.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Since that time, he's a
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; So the believers can always see him. You
[30:16] know, the the police were chasing some
[30:19] &gt;&gt; a gang ofis
[30:22] and one
[30:25] was limping.
[30:29] So the police left all these other
[30:31] spring box and they were after this
[30:34] limping one.
[30:38] because it was an easy catch. You know,
[30:43] &gt;&gt; and people don't realize that Satan is
[30:45] limping
[30:53] and the seven seal finished him off.
[31:03] One day it was the prophet Isaiah's
[31:07] when he looked up he saw him.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; He said,
[31:17] "How did you fall?"
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; You thought you would go beyond God.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] He saw him down there in a
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; So since that time he is crippling.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; He's limping. I mean he's a
[31:46] He's limping.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Now those who don't know him.
[31:55] If you arrive, you will stand still. So
[31:58] that you can see that is
[32:08] now
[32:11] this great chain of perfection
[32:15] broken
[32:20] by time space
[32:23] &gt;&gt; because of sin.
[32:26] Satan caused it.
[32:30] It dropped down to a space of time
[32:34] for the trying and the perfecting
[32:39] and for the patching of the lost.
[32:42] God by his sovereign grace
[32:46] somehow lift that little hickey.
[32:52] Amen. Back into a perfect cycle.
[32:58] for it to roll again the same.
[33:04] Now this little loop down down there,
[33:10] Jesus came from eternity,
[33:14] he stepped into the time space
[33:18] and was made flesh
[33:20] and came here in order to sanctify.
[33:25] and to put a a streak
[33:30] of blood
[33:32] across this place,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; that place of that God.
[33:42] Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to to spread
[33:47] a a a sprinkle blood there
[33:51] across that place to redeem it.
[33:55] To redeem that place of Adam
[33:59] to redeem Adam,
[34:01] the place of Adam
[34:05] to redeem the garden of Eden again
[34:09] because the Garden of Eden itself is a
[34:11] believer.
[34:15] He He redeems the man
[34:19] and his place.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; If God redeems you,
[34:30] then he redeems your position.
[34:35] Amen. Amen.
[34:37] So as a redeemed being
[34:42] occupy a redeemed position.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid that anybody can overrun
[34:53] me on that
[34:56] because my position was redeemed.
[35:12] They want to take my pastor.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, they want to take my pastorship
[35:19] because
[35:22] because his pastorship
[35:25] &gt;&gt; was not redeemed.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; And
[35:36] he he came
[35:40] &gt;&gt; stepped into time.
[35:42] He
[35:43] &gt;&gt; he came to that gap.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Stepped into time.
[35:49] Amen. Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; To bring it again.
[35:56] Now to bring it again together,
[36:01] &gt;&gt; bring Adam back to that place
[36:04] is to bring Adam.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; To bring it back again
[36:11] to bring it back again
[36:14] is to bring Adam
[36:18] &gt;&gt; to the
[36:20] gap.
[36:22] Hallelujah.
[36:24] Amen.
[36:26] Now you say Adam.
[36:29] Yeah. Adam.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Adam. The man. Adam.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; We were all Adam.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Now Adam
[36:47] &gt;&gt; was given a sword.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Brother was the redeemed Adam.
[36:58] He is the redeemed Adam.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; To repossess again.
[37:09] Now let's run it down to keep to a safe
[37:13] time.
[37:15] So blood across the place to redeem it
[37:21] back with God again.
[37:25] eternity.
[37:28] Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Now I will take the end of it here.
[37:33] For the prophet says he came with the
[37:37] other end of the road of the robe
[37:42] and he had the other end of the robe
[37:47] it together again.
[37:49] [Music]
[37:50] That's why we have the Old and the New
[37:52] Testament.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; And now the seventh man was God's answer
[38:07] for the closing of the gap.
[38:12] That's why he says, "I come standing in
[38:14] the gap."
[38:18] Now let me let's get to this one here.
[38:23] Amen. Blasphemerous names.
[38:26] Uh the prophet says here
[38:30] blasphemous names. This one is page 26.
[38:37] Blasphemous names. Amen. It says
[38:41] &gt;&gt; uh God
[38:44] &gt;&gt; specially upon Adam
[38:48] the breath of eternal life
[38:52] and he became eternal person with God
[38:58] power like God.
[39:03] Yeah.
[39:04] The brother is very careful. He had
[39:08] power like
[39:11] &gt;&gt; for God said, "Let us make man in our
[39:13] image and in our likeness."
[39:19] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a mature God.
[39:23] He was God of the earth,
[39:26] not God of a heaven.
[39:29] Amen. He was God of the earth.
[39:33] And someday
[39:35] the sons of God will again become God.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Now I always don't believe someday to be
[39:53] just another day that I don't know of
[39:59] and keep on eternally saying someday
[40:06] I believe that that day.
[40:10] Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan says,
[40:15] &gt;&gt; he said,
[40:17] &gt;&gt; "At that day you shall know that I am in
[40:19] you."
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And brother says, "It's this day."
[40:28] &gt;&gt; He he could not keep on saying at that
[40:31] day
[40:37] That day must
[40:41] [Music]
[40:43] so brother Brennham says
[40:45] now this day
[40:50] it is like
[40:52] the lamb took the book
[40:56] from the throne.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The lamb took the book from the
[40:59] throne.
[41:02] And what else?
[41:05] &gt;&gt; It can't just be the lamb took the book.
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] He left the place.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:17] He took the book and walked away.
[41:20] And the prophet says he thundered behind
[41:25] after he had left the place.
[41:29] That's why we can't preach thunders.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; What we can preach
[41:37] &gt;&gt; is the mystery of the thunders.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; What went
[41:49] we can illustrate it again.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I say every time the president would
[41:56] leave the place
[41:59] There will be some
[42:04] and they would fire some canons
[42:09] and the president is moving on.
[42:15] But there's nothing in those.
[42:19] The president is president.
[42:23] Now the eyes of the people
[42:26] are on the thunders of the president.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; If they say it revealed
[42:42] then I must see something that it is
[42:43] revealed.
[42:47] island.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; What the thunders revealed is this
[42:51] thing.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; It can't just beh
[42:59] the seals were revealed.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; They revealed something.
[43:06] It is that something that we must
[43:08] receive.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] It is like this pastor from the
[43:20] s called church of Christ.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; I was preaching at the funeral.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; I said something about uh the they ate
[43:31] from the tree of life
[43:33] from the tree of knowledge
[43:36] &gt;&gt; and that was adultery.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Now this pastor after the service
[43:46] He says, "No, I hear that you say
[43:49] um
[43:51] in the Garden of Eden
[43:54] it was adultery or what? What else?"
[43:57] I said, "Yeah, this is what the Bible
[43:59] says.
[44:02] They ate from the tree of knowledge
[44:05] and they realized that they were naked."
[44:09] &gt;&gt; So, can you interpret that they ate from
[44:13] the tree of knowledge?
[44:15] realized that they were naked.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Their eyes were open.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; You can take it to a little girl today.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; She comes up
[44:30] and uh of course we don't have sweet 16s
[44:33] today
[44:35] before.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; We used to have sweet 16.
[44:44] But it's no longer sweet because 16 has
[44:47] a child already.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] Now he says
[45:04] &gt;&gt; uh the Bible says they ate from the
[45:08] &gt;&gt; they ate from from from the uh they ate
[45:10] the fruits.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; I said no the the right interpretation
[45:16] is a fruit not fruit
[45:24] of the tree not fruits of the tree.
[45:28] That tree has one fruit.
[45:33] Now you can read between the lines.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; The tree had one fruit.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; And when their eyes were opened,
[45:47] the Bible says they saw that the tree
[45:49] was pleasant.
[45:57] Amen. Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Whistling started just there.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; They saw that the tree was
[46:08] &gt;&gt; pleasant to the eye.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] And good for food.
[46:17] Now you can go back to come back today.
[46:23] when she grows up
[46:27] &gt;&gt; and that boy.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Once they touch touch that fruit,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; they become wild.
[46:38] [Music]
[46:41] Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Every time they feel guilty
[46:49] or she feels guilty.
[46:53] Every time you call her or
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; He feels so guilty
[47:04] &gt;&gt; and they start to do this.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; It's now 4:00. Where were you?
[47:21] Okay, let me leave it like that.
[47:24] Let's let's let's finish here with the
[47:26] gods.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; God specially upon Adam breath the
[47:32] breath of life and made him an eternal
[47:36] person.
[47:41] That's why he lost the battle in nature.
[47:46] I will redeem
[47:50] because the seed is still there.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; He had power like God.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Let me talk to a brother.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; He had power
[48:12] &gt;&gt; like God.
[48:19] He was an amateur god.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; He was God of the earth.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And someday
[48:28] the sons of God
[48:31] will again become God.
[48:36] [Music]
[48:41] &gt;&gt; When is someday?
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's why
[48:46] Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; That's why I say
[48:52] &gt;&gt; he took the book,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; then he walked away.
[48:58] And the prophet says he standed where he
[49:01] left.
[49:08] [Music]
