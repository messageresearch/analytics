[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; The most difficult people to convince
[1:24:50] that you are a believer are your own
[1:24:52] children
[1:24:57] because they see when you are low, they
[1:24:59] see when you are high.

[1:25:07] They see when you're doing your
[1:25:08] businesses.

[1:35:02] message are now grayhaired. I'm
[1:35:04] wondering what's
[1:35:11] getting late
[1:35:14] my brother. You're becoming bigger now.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; You're married.
[1:35:21] God bless you. So I can dismiss you for
[1:35:23] the time being.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; We'll come later on.
[1:35:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] So today we are starting from a new sin.
[1:35:37] Hallelujah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Look at this scripture.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Can I have the scripture back?
[1:35:43] John 12 verse 20.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible is very very specific
[1:35:50] book.
[1:35:53] Very specific specific. And uh what you
[1:35:57] need to do
[1:35:58] just have a friend who can introduce to
[1:36:01] you how to read the scriptures
[1:36:05] and then from there you take over.
[1:36:08] I never read the scriptures the way I'm
[1:36:10] reading now.
[1:36:13] I met pastor
[1:36:16] and a few others of my friends who are
[1:36:18] in message
[1:36:20] showing me how to get the scriptures
[1:36:22] correct
[1:36:25] and here it is and there were Greeks
[1:36:30] now these are Greeks
[1:36:34] for you to understand what it is it's
[1:36:37] because maybe you haven't heard this
[1:36:41] but this is like
[1:36:43] These were Greeks.
[1:36:46] But verse 21 says
[1:36:48] they came to Philillip
[1:36:51] and Philip of Beth
[1:36:55] of Galilee. So that means Philip was a
[1:36:58] galon.
[1:37:01] When they say you a Galilean
[1:37:04] that means you are a less knowledgeable
[1:37:06] person.
[1:37:09] What? What you you are just like for
[1:37:14] you're from the village.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Because go to the book of acts.
[1:37:25] You hear the people were saying
[1:37:28] these people are galians.
[1:37:31] Why are they speaking English? Why are
[1:37:34] they speaking Greek?
[1:37:37] A was supposed to know any language.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; They were only supposed to know Galian
[1:37:49] because they were Galians.
[1:37:51] So these were Greeks.
[1:37:54] The Greeks at that time were the most
[1:37:58] knowledgeable people.
[1:38:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Now the Galidians
[1:38:07] they came to ask no the Greeks
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; the people who were educated
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; it's like uh maybe oh no those of you
[1:38:19] from don't get don't get offense
[1:38:23] it's like um a person from trying to
[1:38:26] teach somebody from Pritoria or
[1:38:27] Johansburg
[1:38:41] That's what is here.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; put it open.
[1:38:48] They came to Philip
[1:38:50] who was a Galilean
[1:38:53] saying
[1:38:57] we would want to see Jesus.
[1:39:02] So if you want to see Jesus,
[1:39:05] don't go for this modded preaches.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Ask a Gonal
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:25] until you put special effects in the
[1:39:27] church.
[1:39:33] For what?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You are bringing Hollywood in the
[1:39:37] church.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; We are not supposed to attract you with
[1:39:44] anything in this message except the word
[1:39:47] of the hour.
[1:39:49] [Applause]
[1:39:58] And my brother, my sister,
[1:40:01] there's no one who can worship God
[1:40:03] better than a a a man from Switzerland.
[1:40:16] Unfortunately, they were they they were
[1:40:18] tricked in Switzerland.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Sorry,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; in Swandland they were tricked
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; because instead of worshiping God, they
[1:40:27] worship a man.
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:43] You were supposed to do that for God.
[1:40:44] Please
[1:40:47] [Applause]
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; do the same for God.
[1:41:00] from the beginning. How he opened the
[1:41:03] eyes of Adam. How he opened the Red Sea.
[1:41:07] How he opened the mighty Jordan.
[1:41:10] How he was there on Mount H. How he took
[1:41:13] down Golth
[1:41:16] you were there on Mount Sunset. You were
[1:41:19] there in Canyon.
[1:41:23] Amen.
[1:41:31] Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; We are supposed to talk all the good
[1:41:35] things which God has done for us.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:41] So the Greeks came to a less
[1:41:44] knowledgeable person
[1:41:51] would see Jesus.
[1:41:53] Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; My brother, you can give me the 6 6304
[1:42:01] 0604.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 33.
[1:42:11] So the Greeks
[1:42:13] were the people of that time,
[1:42:17] the highly educated
[1:42:20] men
[1:42:22] living in the world of arts.
[1:42:28] These Greeks were people who were
[1:42:31] converted
[1:42:35] to the Jewish religion
[1:42:38] and they were also waiting for the
[1:42:40] coming of the Messiah.
[1:42:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; So there was no doubt. Yes. There my
[1:42:47] brother that the same one the 33 that
[1:42:49] one that there that.
[1:42:53] So they came for the feast.
[1:42:57] So now the Greeks were very high level
[1:43:01] talented people.
[1:43:05] They were leading the world of art.
[1:43:09] They were highly educated,
[1:43:12] great people.
[1:43:14] They were great scholars.
[1:43:16] They read many books.
[1:43:21] But there is something
[1:43:24] in a man's heart,
[1:43:27] that great thirst
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; that comes to the human heart.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; They knew
[1:43:40] they needed eternal life.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Philip
[1:43:46] took them
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; to Jesus.
[1:43:50] When they found Jesus,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; oh, they were so disappointed
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; because they saw a man.
[1:44:01] Amen.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; That is why those of you who are friends
[1:44:05] of mine who are together in the Catholic
[1:44:06] church,
[1:44:12] when they give you a picture of Jesus,
[1:44:16] they put a heart there
[1:44:19] coming out because they don't want him
[1:44:20] to be a man. They want him to be
[1:44:22] something.
[1:44:24] They don't want him to be a man.
[1:44:27] They want something,
[1:44:30] something a little bit more added up
[1:44:35] to be their knowledge of God.
[1:44:41] But God, God, doesn't work that way.
[1:44:49] Because if I came here and my eyes are
[1:44:52] there stars coming out my my mouth
[1:44:56] things coming out
[1:44:58] you people don't doesn't need to be
[1:45:00] believers to believe the word
[1:45:06] because you'll be believing the special
[1:45:09] effects.
[1:45:15] That's why you see uh some of our
[1:45:18] prophets, some of them are riding in the
[1:45:20] air, some of them are doing what?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Those things are not for believers.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You can come to Malawi. You can you can
[1:45:35] hire somebody to send a whirlwind
[1:45:37] somewhere. Those of can tell you there's
[1:45:40] a real wind for
[1:45:51] That doesn't take God.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet was in Germany.
[1:45:58] People were sending wind to him in the
[1:45:59] name of the father or the son.
[1:46:05] Special effects are not for.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; So
[1:46:19] 34 the next verse. Then when a man
[1:46:24] and then a man try to satisfy this
[1:46:27] thirst
[1:46:34] want
[1:46:40] this part
[1:46:42] this
[1:46:44] is a thirst for God.
[1:46:48] You can take anything to replace God.
[1:46:54] You will find that you are still empty.
[1:47:01] You can take drugs. You can take
[1:47:04] alcohol, you can women, you can take
[1:47:08] what? You can take money.
[1:47:11] It will never suffice.
[1:47:21] I don't know about your country
[1:47:24] but in Malawi the people who are big
[1:47:27] thieves are the people who are rich.
[1:47:34] So you'll be wondering he has money but
[1:47:37] he steals money
[1:47:43] all the big deals which are very much
[1:47:46] billion dollar deals
[1:47:49] are done by people got billions
[1:47:52] until one day I would want to ask them
[1:47:54] you had three billion and you have sold
[1:47:56] four billion what are you going to do
[1:47:57] with it?
[1:48:01] No, I just want to have it
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; because as long as it's not filled up
[1:48:07] with God
[1:48:10] space, if it's not filled with God,
[1:48:13] you will still feel empty.
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:22] So that's why the Greeks with all their
[1:48:24] knowledge,
[1:48:28] all their education,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; they they still wanted to see Jesus.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:39] We are supposed to see Jesus.
[1:48:42] Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem with many of us
[1:48:48] even in here
[1:48:50] we can talk about Jesus
[1:48:53] of the past
[1:48:57] how Jesus worked with Paul
[1:49:00] worked with Matthew
[1:49:06] until today.
[1:49:08] We are very good experts
[1:49:11] to say how Jesus worked with brother
[1:49:14] Brham.
[1:49:17] But unfortunately
[1:49:19] here we are. How many here can raise up
[1:49:22] their hands. They were alive when
[1:49:25] brother was here.
[1:49:30] No one. No. There are few of us who are
[1:49:34] here. Uh the preacher was not alive.
[1:49:36] Maybe brother was was there
[1:49:41] must have been there
[1:49:44] in 1960s.
[1:49:47] Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; But for me, brother came and went before
[1:49:50] I was born
[1:49:54] and I'm not young.
[1:50:03] So I cannot be talking about Jesus of
[1:50:06] brother Brana.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; I want my Jesus of today.
[1:50:15] I would want to see Jesus today.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want the historical Jesus.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:50:28] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:50:36] So where is this Jesus?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; First John 1 verse one.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; John 1 John 1 verse one.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Brham was on the mountain.
[1:50:54] Brother
[1:50:56] or brother stop.
[1:51:00] So that was 60 years ago.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; That's 60 years ago.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; 60 years.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's in history.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] That which was in the beginning,
[1:51:16] we have heard,
[1:51:18] we have seen our eyes,
[1:51:21] which we looked upon,
[1:51:24] our hands
[1:51:26] have handled
[1:51:28] the word of life.
[1:51:31] Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Our hands.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Is it talking about John?
[1:51:43] He talking about who
[1:51:47] our hands
[1:51:51] have handled
[1:51:53] the word of life
[1:51:56] too my brother for a life was manifested
[1:52:00] to us.
[1:52:04] A life was manifested to us.
[1:52:08] We have seen it and we bear witness.
[1:52:12] And I am standing here
[1:52:15] to show unto you that eternal life
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; which was manifested unto us.
[1:52:24] Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says tell
[1:52:28] tell this to your children.
[1:52:32] Your children should tell your children.
[1:52:35] Their children should tell their
[1:52:36] children.
[1:52:39] Hallelujah.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; So what I a life was manifested to us.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Whose life was manifested to me
[1:52:53] of brother Brham?
[1:52:55] No, I didn't see brother.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; The one who came to me was in
[1:53:02] Amen. Amen. A life was manifested to me.
[1:53:07] Now I need to manifest the same life to
[1:53:10] you.
[1:53:15] So
[1:53:18] don't look at
[1:53:20] look at me
[1:53:22] because what was in now is incodima
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:29] doesn't beat his wife.
[1:53:32] I don't beat my wife. You shouldn't beat
[1:53:35] your wife.
[1:53:37] It comes from one
[1:53:40] to another to another.
[1:53:43] So it is coming from our fathers
[1:53:47] to us. Now we are living to our
[1:53:49] children.
[1:53:52] It's a cycle which is not supposed to be
[1:53:54] broken.
[1:54:00] Amen.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; If I preach something else
[1:54:04] which I've never seen been manifested to
[1:54:06] me
[1:54:09] then I'm wrong
[1:54:11] because these things is about
[1:54:14] apprentichip
[1:54:17] in the past the message for 1,500 years
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; there was no Bible it was about people
[1:54:28] seeing Peter
[1:54:30] and the one who sees Peter,
[1:54:32] tells the people what he saw Peter
[1:54:34] doing,
[1:54:36] he goes, the other one comes, tells the
[1:54:39] people how Peter was doing.
[1:54:42] He goes, the other one comes. That's how
[1:54:46] the message is about
[1:54:48] for us to tell our children.
[1:54:51] We have to manifest these things, my
[1:54:54] brother.
[1:54:59] We have to manifest grace.
[1:55:02] Life has been manifested to us.
[1:55:06] We have to live the exactly what was
[1:55:08] manifested to us
[1:55:11] for the message of power not to lose its
[1:55:14] power.
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:20] Amen. Amen. God will give us pastors
[1:55:25] after our his heart
[1:55:28] to show us to manifest to us
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; the word of the hour.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Three, my brother.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Three.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Verse three.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Verse three.
[1:55:42] That which we have seen
[1:55:46] and heard,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; declare we unto you.
[1:55:52] You see there we see how it is being
[1:55:56] done. Then we declare to you
[1:56:00] so you also might have fellowship with
[1:56:02] us.
[1:56:05] Our fellowship is with the father
[1:56:09] son Jesus Christ.
[1:56:14] So today if I a preacher here
[1:56:19] I should come before you
[1:56:21] before you church
[1:56:23] and tell you who can bring me of sin.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hey listen
[1:56:39] I'm not saying who can
[1:56:45] No,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; me
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; the the the the student.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Because you must say I know.
[1:57:01] Yeah. Because
[1:57:03] that thing
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; is supposed to be continuously going.
[1:57:12] Now it is on brother after brother Ja
[1:57:15] then it goes to Si and
[1:57:19] from there there will be somebody else
[1:57:20] coming again
[1:57:22] should continue
[1:57:25] it's a continuum
[1:57:29] God shall never be without a witness
[1:57:33] so somebody should come and say
[1:57:36] a sin on me
[1:57:40] not me you
[1:57:43] You should go there in M west or east or
[1:57:48] south
[1:57:50] and stand
[1:57:52] among your neighbors
[1:57:54] who can blame me of sin.
[1:58:00] I'm not talking about me only. I'm
[1:58:03] talking about you.
[1:58:08] It's you
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; because
[1:58:11] if a seed abides alone,
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; it will never.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; So we every time in the past go people
[1:58:24] wanted to see God.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Uh most of the lies which you hear are
[1:58:33] happening in the world there.
[1:58:37] It's people trying to make God as if
[1:58:39] he's somewhere very far.
[1:58:45] So if you want to approach God, then you
[1:58:46] have to ask them to approach God for
[1:58:48] you.
[1:58:53] Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:58:57] you yourself
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; must see Jesus.
[1:59:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; If you want to see Jesus,
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; ask Philip
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; the he will take you there.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; One day the Israelites wanted to see
[1:59:25] Jesus wanted to see God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; So God came.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Exodus 19, brother. Exodus 19. Exodus
[1:59:34] 19, my brother.
[1:59:37] Exodus 19:8.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; 19:8.
[1:59:44] Exodus chapter 19 verse 18. Yes.
[1:59:51] And Mount Sai was altogether on smoke
[1:59:55] because the Lord descended upon it in
[1:59:57] fire. And the smoke thereof ascended as
[2:00:01] the smoke of a furnace, and the whole
[2:00:04] mount quaked greatly.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. 20
[2:00:11] And the Lord came down upon the mount
[2:00:14] upon Mount Si on on the top of the mount
[2:00:18] and the Lord called Moses up to the top
[2:00:21] of the mount and Moses went up.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; So you can see here people wanted to see
[2:00:27] God.
[2:00:28] God came, little God, the father himself
[2:00:34] came and it was thunderlings,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; it was fire,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; it was smoke and the earth was shaking.
[2:00:44] I'm telling my brother, if there was a
[2:00:47] this building starts shaking, I don't
[2:00:49] know how many of you will remain in
[2:00:50] here,
[2:00:54] but I'll be one of the first ones to go
[2:00:55] out.
[2:01:03] The earthquake
[2:01:07] with the quaking of the earth,
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; the thunderings,
[2:01:12] the lightning,
[2:01:14] the people moved a far,
[2:01:17] but Moses went up
[2:01:22] and the people came back to Moses
[2:01:25] on verse Uh
[2:01:29] uh Exodus 20,
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Exodus 20,
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; verse 18,
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; verse 18.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And all the people saw the thunderings
[2:01:41] and the lightnings and the noise of the
[2:01:43] trumpet and the mountain smoking. And
[2:01:47] when the people saw it, they removed and
[2:01:49] stood a
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; What? What? What happened?
[2:01:53] When the earth was quaking, when the
[2:01:56] thunderings were there, when the
[2:01:57] lightning was there,
[2:02:00] everybody
[2:02:02] moved a
[2:02:05] Moses
[2:02:07] went up the mountain.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; 19
[2:02:12] And they said unto Moses, "Speak thou
[2:02:14] with us, and we will hear, but let not
[2:02:17] God speak with us, lest we die."
[2:02:20] And this is where we are now.
[2:02:23] We need a man to be speaking to us.
[2:02:27] We don't see don't see God. We don't
[2:02:29] want God to speak to us anymore.
[2:02:32] If God is going to speak to us today,
[2:02:36] he will speak to us through a man.
[2:02:42] If you want to see Jesus today,
[2:02:45] we will see.
[2:02:48] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; So one day Zakius wanted to see Jesus
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; he was a sinner.
[2:03:00] He was short.
[2:03:03] He came short.
[2:03:08] So he said let me hide in a tree.
[2:03:14] Now, brother Abraham says
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; that revelation
[2:03:19] of going into a tree
[2:03:23] made Zakius
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; to look down upon Jesus.
[2:03:32] That's what says
[2:03:34] the shortest man
[2:03:36] look down upon Jesus.
[2:03:46] No wonder today
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; when Jesus is in a man
[2:03:52] look people look down upon him
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; even the short ones as well
[2:04:03] I don't say short in terms of size the
[2:04:05] short is in the spiritual shortness
[2:04:17] So when Jesus said,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; "Zakius,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; come down." You know, Jesus didn't even
[2:04:24] look up.
[2:04:26] He He just say, "Zakius, come down."
[2:04:29] The people said, "Where is Zakius?"
[2:04:32] They saw him coming down. How did he see
[2:04:35] him? God knows where you are.
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:41] You can try to hide.
[2:04:43] He know it doesn't even need to be. Come
[2:04:46] here.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; I know you know that you are a sinner.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; I know you know you not have come short.
[2:04:55] I want to go to your house.
[2:04:58] How can how can how can if he's God, how
[2:05:02] can he go to this man's house? We know
[2:05:05] this man is a sinner. A little sinner.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus loves the sinners.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; He goes to their houses
[2:05:24] because they a well man doesn't need a
[2:05:28] physician.
[2:05:30] It is a man who is sick who needs a
[2:05:33] physician.
[2:05:34] So Jesus
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; granted the desire of Zakius
[2:05:44] because Zakius had a desire
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; to see him. My brother, can you have a
[2:05:52] desire to see Jesus?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:03] One day
[2:06:04] there was a bl a blind man somewhere in
[2:06:08] uh this is my brother 50 01 0 0 disases
[2:06:13] and afflictions diseases and affliction
[2:06:16] 50.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; This is a man who was uh who was blind
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; and uh he he his mother was a very
[2:06:29] saintly old woman.
[2:06:35] So one day, brother Bham was in
[2:06:38] Arkansas.
[2:06:41] His mother came to him in a dream after
[2:06:43] he had already passed away.
[2:06:48] You see you mothers, can you be
[2:06:50] spiritual so that you can come back back
[2:06:52] to us in a dream?
[2:06:56] Good dreams.
[2:06:59] Don't chase us with pangas when you die.
[2:07:00] You people
[2:07:04] angry until you are so fiery until when
[2:07:07] we dream about you chasing us with
[2:07:09] pangas.
[2:07:20] Let's see how this man his mommy come
[2:07:23] back to him.
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:28] You you you can read about it at the
[2:07:30] beginning there. He said he saw his
[2:07:32] mother living a saintly life.
[2:07:39] Amen. Are you there my brother? Uh 501 Z
[2:07:44] and applications paragraph 145.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 145. Amen. So this mother
[2:07:50] lived a life
[2:07:53] before his child.
[2:07:56] She never told him a lie.
[2:07:59] She had been dead for 10 years.
[2:08:04] That's there it is. Person
[2:08:06] actually was moving in Arkansas. By that
[2:08:10] time there was segregation.
[2:08:15] So the black people would stand on one
[2:08:17] side.
[2:08:18] white people standing walking on the
[2:08:20] other side. So one day brother heard
[2:08:23] somebody crying mercy me.
[2:08:28] So he turned to see this man and his
[2:08:33] wife. The brothers who were with him
[2:08:37] told him, "Brother, brother, don't go
[2:08:39] there. Those are blacks.
[2:08:47] It will cause a riot."
[2:08:50] Rabb told the brothers, "I can never do
[2:08:53] that."
[2:08:55] So he went over
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; to this man who was blind and the man he
[2:09:01] said person he said my old mommy was a
[2:09:06] good religious woman.
[2:09:11] She never told me a lie all her life.
[2:09:16] She had been dead for 10 years now.
[2:09:20] I never had you in all my life.
[2:09:25] He never heard about
[2:09:29] I live about 100 miles from here.
[2:09:34] Last night
[2:09:36] I've been blind for many years.
[2:09:40] Last night I woke up
[2:09:42] standing beside my bed,
[2:09:46] stood my old mommy
[2:09:49] and she said,
[2:09:51] "Honey,
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; child, go to Elorado,
[2:09:57] Arkansas
[2:09:58] and ask for somebody
[2:10:02] by the name Bran.
[2:10:06] The Lord has given a gift
[2:10:09] of divine healing.
[2:10:12] You shall receive your sight.
[2:10:16] Oh my.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; I feel like my heart would get big.
[2:10:22] I see God speaking.
[2:10:27] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:10:29] This woman lived a sentry life
[2:10:34] before his her children.
[2:10:37] Sisters, let's live a sentry life before
[2:10:40] our children.
[2:10:45] Amen. Amen.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; And this man that day
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; received his sight.
[2:10:58] Who told him?
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; His mother
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; who had been died
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; for so many years.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Where did he find Jesus in?
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; In a man.
[2:11:18] He told him the mother said
[2:11:23] there's a man
[2:11:25] his name
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; is Branham.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; So a man,
[2:11:36] a woman,
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; a saintly woman
[2:11:40] is very very important in our midst.
[2:11:45] Especially
[2:11:50] if they rest in peace.
[2:11:55] Amen.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Some of you dream of your mothers
[2:11:58] beating you
[2:12:03] because that's the way they left you.
[2:12:04] They left you.
[2:12:12] But a good woman
[2:12:16] would do this.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says son.

[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; So if you go to the um
[2:12:35] it's already passed off. Okay, that's
[2:12:37] fine. Now
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; just believe me.
[2:12:40] I'm a friend to pastor.
[2:12:44] I wouldn't tell you anything wrong.
[2:12:48] But it's for you to be searching these
[2:12:50] scriptures.
[2:12:52] So let me not read again so that I'm on
[2:12:56] I've got 35 slides but I'm on 11 so I
[2:12:59] need to finish. I need to finish.
[2:13:03] So let me just speak. You read later on.
[2:13:07] So there was a man on the pool of
[2:13:10] besides
[2:13:13] this man
[2:13:14] was at the pool
[2:13:17] for 38 years. 38 38 years. 38 years.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Those of you who are not 38, a man had
[2:13:25] been sitting on a pool for 38 years.
[2:13:31] 38. Nobody felt for him.
[2:13:38] My brother,
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; when you are poor,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; all your relatives run away.
[2:13:50] Ask anybody who is poor here. I just
[2:13:54] when last did the their relatives come
[2:13:57] to their house?
[2:14:04] Those who actually chase the out the
[2:14:07] villagers from their home.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; You know this man,
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; it was very easy.
[2:14:19] The pool was like the way it is here.
[2:14:23] So he was paralyzed.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; So when the angel
[2:14:28] disturbs the water, it was very simple.
[2:14:32] Take him,
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; put him in the water and take him out
[2:14:38] and he will be well. No man do that for
[2:14:46] every time. When you are in trouble, my
[2:14:49] brother, you suffer alone.
[2:15:03] You know if you are using a battered car
[2:15:04] even the people asking for a lift they
[2:15:06] don't want to go into your car
[2:15:10] they want a better car to get a lift in
[2:15:13] just imagine they don't even have a car
[2:15:14] when they looking for a lift they want a
[2:15:16] better car
[2:15:24] that's the problem with people
[2:15:27] they only good only good at you
[2:15:31] in good times.
[2:15:35] People are only good to you when good
[2:15:37] times
[2:15:41] going bad times.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; So one day they found him. They say it
[2:15:52] was a it was a Sabbath.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; So they found him. He's carrying his m.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; You
[2:16:04] didn't want to celebrate with him.
[2:16:07] That's the problem with your people.
[2:16:11] Your friend has been walking
[2:16:14] for many years. He comes with a car, you
[2:16:17] want to criticize him instead of
[2:16:18] celebrating with him.
[2:16:22] So he was carrying he was celebrating
[2:16:26] Do you know the first thing I said to
[2:16:28] him? Why are you carrying a mat? Why are
[2:16:30] you carrying a mat?
[2:16:33] Instead of asking him, how did you walk?
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; He told him the man who told me to walk
[2:16:47] is the one who told me to carry the mat.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; So you want me to listen only to the
[2:16:53] walking and not carry the mat?
[2:17:01] The man
[2:17:02] who told me
[2:17:06] to walk told me to carry the mu
[2:17:13] he is wrong
[2:17:15] because today Sabbath
[2:17:18] no man who told me to walk told me to
[2:17:24] carry the
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:30] They kept asking him questions
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; and he asked them, "You're asking me too
[2:17:36] many questions.
[2:17:38] Do you want also to become his
[2:17:40] disciples?
[2:17:46] You're asking me too many questions
[2:17:47] about
[2:17:49] Do you want also to be his disciple?
[2:18:01] He was asking them all these questions.
[2:18:03] Oh, how is the pastor? How is this? How
[2:18:05] is that? He wants us to be his
[2:18:06] disciples.
[2:18:13] Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; The man who told me
[2:18:19] to carry my to to walk
[2:18:23] Brother, he was lying there for 38
[2:18:26] years.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; The water was being disturbed. There
[2:18:30] were go and read the Bible say there
[2:18:32] were many people at that at that pool.
[2:18:37] But nobody felt for him.
[2:18:39] [Music]
[2:18:40] Everybody for himself.
[2:18:45] It was a South Africa my friend.
[2:18:48] It was South Africa.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody for himself.
[2:19:00] Is it like that here?
[2:19:03] [Laughter]
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody for himself.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:13] uh in Malawi there
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; when they when when they want to the
[2:19:18] presidency
[2:19:20] they say we we are suffering we are we
[2:19:23] are this
[2:19:25] as soon as they go into the chair
[2:19:28] the only people who benefits
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; it's him and his concubines and his
[2:19:34] children
[2:19:39] but when they want our finger they want
[2:19:41] they say We
[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; So my brother, when Jesus came,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; everything changed
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; because a man came and this man he
[2:19:57] didn't even know that this was Jesus.
[2:20:02] And they asked him, "What is the name of
[2:20:04] the man who has healed you?"
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know."
[2:20:10] So until one day he met him again
[2:20:15] and that's when he he knew his name
[2:20:19] that's only the time which he
[2:20:22] but the day he was healed
[2:20:24] he never even knew the name of Jesus
[2:20:29] what is new
[2:20:31] a man
[2:20:36] a man
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; a man So we can come to Auntie Jamaima
[2:20:42] who came to her
[2:20:44] a man she didn't know his name.
[2:20:48] No but when she was praying
[2:20:52] she said I am theite woman. Where is my
[2:20:57] Elijah?
[2:21:00] How the Elijah came?
[2:21:03] She didn't care about that because your
[2:21:05] prayer is not supposed to be guided by
[2:21:09] your own thoughts.
[2:21:14] Your prayer should be a deep prayer.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you. My brother
[2:21:23] yesterday he said, "I found my wife in
[2:21:25] the deepest of
[2:21:28] sleep." Sleep.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:32] Brother,
[2:21:33] can you stop this lapid eye movement
[2:21:36] prayers?
[2:21:46] There's so much rapid eye movement
[2:21:48] prayers.
[2:21:52] That is why all the time you find that
[2:21:56] you you are doing things which are not
[2:21:58] correct
[2:22:01] because your prayers are not deep
[2:22:02] enough.
[2:22:05] Your prayer should be deep enough
[2:22:09] until God can cut off your leg.
[2:22:13] God can cut off your hand
[2:22:15] without you knowing.
[2:22:19] Amen. Amen.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; So when brother came,
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; he was he was moving from somewhere to
[2:22:28] somewhere.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; The aeroplane landed in Memphis.
[2:22:36] Today I'm lucky the theical engineer is
[2:22:39] there. He's standing actually on top of
[2:22:41] the table there.
[2:22:46] You can ask him, "How much water do you
[2:22:49] need to be in the air
[2:22:54] to give a plane a frames out?
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; An airplane can move in water,
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; but if the water is too much,
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; the engineer will tell you it will be a
[2:23:12] frames out." So
[2:23:16] frame out that means the airplane's
[2:23:18] engine are not firing anymore.
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:23] That has to be a lot of water
[2:23:26] in the skies there.
[2:23:29] But God did that because Jeremiah was
[2:23:33] praying
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; and the water barrier
[2:23:42] in the sky was so big. It was so high
[2:23:47] the plane couldn't go over it.
[2:23:50] Most of these small small storms
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; the just flies above them.
[2:23:58] small small storms
[2:24:01] the prayer just flies around them
[2:24:04] but this one's
[2:24:06] prayer
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; was for big
[2:24:11] so high
[2:24:16] your prayer my brother my sister
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; can create such a big barrier
[2:24:27] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. If we want
[2:24:32] to see Jesus,
[2:24:34] let's forget about who is around us.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:47] The biggest enemy
[2:24:50] you ever have
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; is this one.
[2:24:56] Oh,
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; my brother. Your biggest enemy.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Where is he?
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; This one.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have a bigger enemy than this
[2:25:11] one.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; The one we need to defeat,
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; it's this one.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, one day
[2:25:26] It will bust wide open
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; and I'll go far beyond the skies.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; When you are looking for your enemies,
[2:25:43] don't look outside,
[2:25:45] look inside.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:53] So God has got his own GPS.
[2:25:58] If if you if you really remember very
[2:26:00] very if you can remember very very well
[2:26:02] go and check all descendants
[2:26:05] you find brother Brham
[2:26:08] the first things you tell you
[2:26:11] is where you are coming from your house
[2:26:14] number
[2:26:15] and your name.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:23] Amen. Amen.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Go and ask them, "Who am I?" Doesn't
[2:26:26] know me.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[2:26:38] He even knows where I stay.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Because if God want to visit me, he will
[2:26:43] come to my house.
[2:26:46] [Music]
[2:26:53] Don't start bothering people who are
[2:26:54] living in Porsche areas to be in their
[2:26:56] houses. Be in your house. God will find
[2:26:58] you there.
[2:27:09] You know, people who live in big houses
[2:27:10] are very mean.
[2:27:15] Somebody has got a house which has got
[2:27:16] eight bedrooms, but he lives there with
[2:27:18] his wife. I don't know what they do with
[2:27:20] the other bedrooms, but I don't know.
[2:27:35] But my brother,
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; God can come to your ty house.
[2:27:46] He cannot go to the openheimers.
[2:27:51] He doesn't like it.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; It's just rugs to him.
[2:28:01] That open house is nothing to God.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Your house is very important to him.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; He will find you there.
[2:28:15] Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; You know you are more you are more
[2:28:20] satisfied with than themh.
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:25] [Applause]
[2:28:29] You can sleep and snow as much as you
[2:28:31] can in your small house. They don't
[2:28:32] sleep in those houses.
[2:28:42] He knows your name. He knows where
[2:28:44] dwelling.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; You remember there was a boy who was
[2:28:50] eating laba.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; So when he was eating laba,
[2:28:55] They tested him.
[2:28:58] They found that in his bones
[2:29:01] he was lacking suffer.
[2:29:06] Something was just drawing him.
[2:29:11] Why?
[2:29:13] because something inside him
[2:29:18] sto
[2:29:21] that I don't know
[2:29:24] uh do you have young women who eat soil
[2:29:28] here it happens a lot
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; ah okay okay that good I'll tell you the
[2:29:34] reason
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; yeah so um due to women being women
[2:29:42] their bodies run out of iron.
[2:29:47] So their nose
[2:29:49] it tells them
[2:29:51] the iron is in the soil.
[2:29:55] That's why they go and buy soil they
[2:29:59] when they soil they better
[2:30:02] because that ailment inside them lack of
[2:30:05] iron inside them is calling for ion.
[2:30:11] Amen.
[2:30:13] Yes sir.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; Inside you
[2:30:17] something is calling for eternal life
[2:30:23] and we are smelling where the eternal
[2:30:25] life is.
[2:30:30] Hallelujah.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; I've come all the Malawi.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; I've passed so many churches.
[2:30:41] I've smelled something here.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Something is here
[2:30:51] which I miss
[2:30:53] eternal life.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; It is here.
[2:30:58] That is why I am here.
[2:31:01] Otherwise, you know, a lot of South
[2:31:04] African people, they go to Malawi to
[2:31:05] find the prophets in Malawi.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31:17] People go to find prophets. We have our
[2:31:19] own prophets in my big ones.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; I've left those ones because something
[2:31:26] is cooking here.
[2:31:29] I smell the way the soil is tasting.
[2:31:37] My brother cannot eat soil by by any
[2:31:40] means. I can but these girls they eat
[2:31:41] soil
[2:31:45] because something inside them
[2:31:48] is calling. So if there's eternal life
[2:31:52] that's why I'm fastesting for it.
[2:31:56] That means it is there. Amen.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; So the boy was eating laba
[2:32:06] because something inside him was calling
[2:32:09] for that.
[2:32:13] So his nose was telling them
[2:32:21] he was not eating metals.
[2:32:24] He was eating exactly what the bones
[2:32:26] were telling him.
[2:32:30] that he lacked.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; You eat what you lack.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; One day Job
[2:32:44] said, "My redeemer liveth."
[2:32:48] One day in the this very same morning,
[2:32:54] I shall see my redeemer.
[2:32:57] It was thousands and thousands of years
[2:33:01] before the redeemer came.
[2:33:04] But I'm telling you to my brother, my
[2:33:05] sister, one day the redeemer came.
[2:33:12] One day the redeemer is coming.
[2:33:17] Hallelujah.
[2:33:23] Oh my brother.
[2:33:27] He has made us priests and kings.
[2:33:31] Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; We are kings.
[2:33:34] We are priests.
[2:33:38] Remember the priesthood
[2:33:40] and the kingship.
[2:33:42] were separated in Jacob
[2:33:47] because when it came to Jacob, the
[2:33:49] scepter went with Judah
[2:33:53] and the the priesthood went with Levi.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; But in Jesus we are coming back.
[2:34:03] Amen. To the priesthood and kingship.
[2:34:09] So the priesthood in me
[2:34:12] should be able to intercede for others.
[2:34:21] The best of of the best we can do for
[2:34:23] one another. My brother,
[2:34:27] if you got nothing to say about me,
[2:34:32] pray for me.
[2:34:37] Amen.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; My brother.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; People have blamed me for things which I
[2:34:43] didn't do.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; But
[2:34:49] you know, people have blamed me for
[2:34:52] looking black like this.
[2:34:58] What should I do?
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; No. Tell me. What should I do?
[2:35:07] I should start swallowing.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Who wanted me to be black?
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; As black as and beautiful the way I am.
[2:35:26] Amen.
[2:35:30] I
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; I I thought I was very beautiful until
[2:35:32] one day my sister told me says, "No, no,
[2:35:34] no, you're not."
[2:35:41] That was the first time which I realized
[2:35:42] that I wasn't that beautiful.
[2:35:45] They told me you are so black.
[2:35:50] She didn't want to hide anything. She
[2:35:51] was very straightforward,
[2:35:55] very honest. and honest.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; Even your nose are so wide open.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; I I don't know what to do for you.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; You know people can blame you for things
[2:36:16] which you are not.
[2:36:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; So God
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; has made us
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; my brother. Can you go to the revelation
[2:36:34] again? If you can find that one.

[2:43:04] than h that what I have.
[2:43:10] If you have happiness,
[2:43:12] even your children will know that you
[2:43:14] are very happy person.

[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; You know when you are a thief,
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; the first person you steal from is
[2:44:36] yourself.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; So when when you a thief,
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; the first person you steal from
[2:44:44] is yourself.
[2:44:52] If you're a fifth, the first person

[2:45:25] to another to another another because

[2:45:33] has come to demolish the devil's
[2:45:34] kingdom.
[2:45:38] My brother, my sister,
[2:45:41] there's no better way to demolish the
[2:45:44] kingdom of the devil than to tell our
[2:45:46] children to live right.
[2:45:58] this business
[2:46:02] because we're walking in the light.
[2:46:04] When you walk in the right,
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; you become the light.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can go away from earth for
[2:46:13] about a billion miles,
[2:46:18] the earth will be lying in the in the in
[2:46:20] in the sunlight
[2:46:24] and you see you see the earth as a star
[2:46:30] and the way you go very far from it,
[2:46:34] the more you tend to wonder
[2:46:37] why people divided the earth into South
[2:46:40] Africa. Zimbabwe. So you can tell your
[2:46:42] friend you know and that star there the
[2:46:44] people they've divided themselves and
[2:46:47] the others areas are zulus. Oh, there
[2:46:59] at the moment there the brundies are
[2:47:02] fighting the two somewhere there
[2:47:06] as as you're going far
[2:47:09] the problems of earth become very small
[2:47:11] for you
[2:47:14] until you tend to wonder
[2:47:17] why are they doing that?
[2:47:19] It's a small place.
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; As much as you go higher,
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; the problem of the earth becomes
[2:47:30] smaller.
[2:47:36] Amen.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um sorry brothers you forgive us.
[2:47:50] Those of us who are educated we want to
[2:47:52] talk something else. So you forgive us.
[2:48:00] Those of us who are educated
[2:48:03] we want to talk
[2:48:07] theorem.
[2:48:10] A² + b²=
[2:48:13] c².
[2:48:17] Did some of you hear that?
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; I'm from Malawi.
[2:48:24] Can you shout a square + B²=
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; C?
[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; You see you, we are speaking the same
[2:48:33] language.
[2:48:35] But this is money making
[2:48:38] yet we speak the same. I am in Malawi.
[2:48:41] You are here. We speak the same. And we
[2:48:44] agreed that it's all right.
[2:48:47] What about the word which is eternal?
[2:48:49] How much do we need to agree on it?
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling the truth,
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; it is that one's honest
[2:49:09] as long as we are on earth.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; Because if you go to the mathematics of
[2:49:13] God,
[2:49:16] He doesn't use that one.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Do you know there was a way from Israel
[2:49:21] to Egypt which was you could travel only
[2:49:22] for two days.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; That was the way for man.
[2:49:34] But God's way passes through the
[2:49:37] mountains,
[2:49:39] deep waters,
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; dry deserts,
[2:49:44] snakes,
[2:49:49] &gt;&gt; bitter waters.
[2:49:52] They went to where there was the water
[2:49:54] was bitter.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; The way of God passes through all those
[2:50:02] things.
[2:50:05] Hallelujah.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; But God told Moses,
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; tell the people to move.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; So God is the same.
[2:50:25] He is the same because remember the
[2:50:28] bright morning star
[2:50:31] the brightest star
[2:50:34] is also the evening star
[2:50:38] is the same star.
[2:50:41] The morning star and the evening star
[2:50:43] are the same star
[2:50:46] because he's the same yesterday, today
[2:50:48] and forever.
[2:50:50] [Applause]
[2:50:53] [Music]
[2:50:55] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; The eastern star
[2:50:59] and the western star
[2:51:01] is one star.
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; They are not two different stars
[2:51:07] and they don't give their own light.
[2:51:11] They get light to the original.
[2:51:15] So you can ask them
[2:51:20] morning sir.
[2:51:22] Why are you shining?
[2:51:24] It will tell you it's not me who is
[2:51:27] shining.
[2:51:30] [Music]
[2:51:32] Morning sir. Why are you pretty?
[2:51:36] You say no it's not me.
[2:51:41] I am walking in the sun
[2:51:45] and the sun is shining upon me.
[2:51:51] Amen.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; So stars don't have their own light.
[2:52:00] They reflect light.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; When do when do stars shine the
[2:52:07] brightest?
[2:52:11] When it is the darkest.
[2:52:15] So when it is the darkest,
[2:52:18] when you are passing the biggest
[2:52:19] problem,
[2:52:21] that's when the time to the start to
[2:52:22] shine the brightest.
[2:52:34] How does the sun give light?
[2:52:39] They will tell you the sun has got
[2:52:43] enough mass
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; and has got enough speed.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; That speed creates enough gravitational
[2:52:52] force upon its core
[2:52:57] and then from there it blasts off.
[2:53:04] For those of you who got time,
[2:53:07] go and look at what the first nuclear
[2:53:09] bomb looked like.
[2:53:13] They did put so many guns around and
[2:53:16] they fired. They fired towards the core
[2:53:19] so that the can explode.
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; They It fired in inwards.
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; Fire inwards.
[2:53:34] Fire at the core
[2:53:37] until you start giving light.
[2:53:42] It squeezes itself so hard.
[2:53:46] It spins so hard
[2:53:50] about who gave it fuel. That one is not
[2:53:52] my question
[2:53:57] because you hear that there are so many
[2:54:00] dark matter outside there.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; We don't see it but we see the sun
[2:54:07] because God
[2:54:11] gave it fuel
[2:54:14] the Holy Ghost to give light.
[2:54:18] [Music]
[2:54:19] But to give light, it has to spin
[2:54:22] itself.
[2:54:24] It has to squeeze itself.
[2:54:28] Amen.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; That squeezing
[2:54:34] that spinning
[2:54:37] it squeezes itself
[2:54:41] to give life.
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; When you come to the earth,
[2:54:50] the earth. That's why the earth is
[2:54:52] spinning
[2:54:55] because once the earth
[2:54:57] stops spinning,
[2:55:00] it will lose its temperature.
[2:55:05] It maintains its temperature
[2:55:09] moving.
[2:55:11] Don't stop. Move.
[2:55:14] Move on, brother.
[2:55:16] you're going to lose your temperature.
[2:55:21] [Music]
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; So the earth keeps on squeezing itself
[2:55:27] by moving fast
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; so that it makes it cold temperature.
[2:55:39] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; the Bible is there in the skies.
[2:55:46] The whole skies is just a Bible
[2:55:52] because God in the beginning
[2:55:55] wrote everything in the skies.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; So today
[2:56:04] watch and pray.
[2:56:08] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:56:17] One day,
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; one day.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Mark 4:38, my brother.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; Mark 4:38.
[2:56:27] &gt;&gt; One day.
[2:56:32] They were on the sea.
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; Are you there, my brother?
[2:56:39] Oh, he's not here. Okay, I'll read.
[2:56:43] Yes. And he was in in the hinder part
[2:56:47] of the ship asleep on the pillow.
[2:56:51] And they awake him
[2:56:54] say, "Be
[2:56:56] careless thou not that we perish."
[2:57:02] And he allows
[2:57:05] and rebuked the wind
[2:57:09] and say, "Peace,
[2:57:12] be still."
[2:57:15] And the wind ceased.
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; And there was a great calm.
[2:57:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. Go wake Jesus.
[2:57:27] No. Go and wake Jesus.
[2:57:31] Thank you. Where is this Jesus? You're
[2:57:33] going to wake up.
[2:57:37] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; He was with them.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; He was there in the sea in the in the
[2:57:42] ship.
[2:57:44] When everything was all right,
[2:57:47] they forgot Jesus was was asleep.
[2:57:53] Only when the storms came.
[2:58:00] Wake up our Lord.
[2:58:05] Because when there was no problem, they
[2:58:07] didn't need him.
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; They were just dancing.
[2:58:14] [Music]
[2:58:16] But when they started rocking,
[2:58:25] they did the right thing.
[2:58:29] Because whenever there's a storm,
[2:58:34] let your Jesus rise up.
[2:58:38] Go wake him.
[2:58:40] Brother preach a message. Go wake Jesus.
[2:58:50] Amen.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't didn't tell preach the
[2:58:54] message. Go run away.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; Go wake up Jesus.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes,
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; what did he say?
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[2:59:11] [Music]
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; Shalom. Hallelujah.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:59:19] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; Because that's what it is. He is
[2:59:27] &gt;&gt; He's a king of peace.
[2:59:33] &gt;&gt; 41 41
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; And the people exed and feared.
[2:59:41] What man of man is this?
[2:59:45] that even a wind
[2:59:48] obey him.

[3:00:26] &gt;&gt; He is within the ship.
[3:00:29] He's within the vessel.
[3:00:33] Who is the vessel today?
[3:00:36] Where's the vessel today?
[3:00:39] Where's the ship?

[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[3:01:19] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[3:01:22] is with me."
[3:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they
[3:01:26] shall be his people, and God himself
[3:01:29] shall be with them, and be their God.

[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; God is with us.
[3:02:19] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of God is with us.
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; He is dwelling in us.

[3:02:32] Are you reading with me? Are you are you
[3:02:34] reading there? Which people he's talking
[3:02:37] about
[3:02:41] us.
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; And God himself
[3:02:48] shall be with them

[3:02:59] We are his people.
[3:03:01] Today if I wanted to tell somebody,
[3:03:05] somebody wanted to say, "Sir, we would
[3:03:09] see Jesus, I need to take him to you."
[3:03:17] &gt;&gt; You are the one.
[3:03:20] That is why
[3:03:22] brother Brham
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; Brother would say would tell the people
[3:03:27] all of you stand still
[3:03:31] be still
[3:03:32] before he start praying for people. He
[3:03:34] said everybody stop moving.
[3:03:39] He wouldn't pray for people
[3:03:42] until all movement has stopped.
[3:03:48] Water stands for people.
[3:03:52] Water stands for people.
[3:03:55] After the people are still
[3:03:59] then he would say now I take control of
[3:04:03] each and every spit in here
[3:04:08] and after that he will start telling you
[3:04:12] where do you come from? What is your
[3:04:14] problem? What is your house number?
[3:04:19] He knows your name.
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[3:04:48] church.
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:53] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you find the preacher
[3:04:54] can preach for more than two hours.

[3:05:04] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,

[3:05:14] Amen.
[3:05:20] We thank God for these young people.
[3:05:24] They make our lives seem easy
[3:05:28] is very difficult.
[3:05:32] Yes. there. Now
[3:05:35] &gt;&gt; to my text,
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; the text which I left to say all this,
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; he is the same
[3:05:44] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever.
[3:05:48] If men,
[3:05:50] these men was desirous to see him,
[3:05:55] God would made a way
[3:05:58] that their anticipation would be
[3:06:00] satisfied.
[3:06:06] If you were desirous,
[3:06:09] you see God,
[3:06:11] God will make a way
[3:06:14] for you to see.
[3:06:18] Amen.
[3:06:21] He made a way
[3:06:23] that they could see him
[3:06:26] by one of his servants.
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't have four servants to show
[3:06:38] them Jesus.
[3:06:44] He told only Philip was enough.
[3:06:50] to show them Jesus.
[3:06:53] [Music]
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; Only one was enough.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; So, and we have the same sincere desire
[3:07:05] to see him today.
[3:07:09] If we had,
[3:07:11] isn't he
[3:07:14] obligated
[3:07:16] to show himself among us?
[3:07:23] &gt;&gt; If you were desirous to see him,
[3:07:26] if you are the same desire as the
[3:07:28] Greeks,
[3:07:30] we see him. Isn't he obligated to show
[3:07:33] you Jesus today?
[3:07:38] Amen.
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a great big statement.
[3:07:48] &gt;&gt; It's there. It's not me.
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; Go and check there. It's there.
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; I can't see it. Where is it? There.
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; Now,
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; now
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; that's a great big statement.
[3:08:07] statement. If you were desirous,
[3:08:13] if you if you came here
[3:08:16] looking for Jesus,
[3:08:18] &gt;&gt; he is obligated
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; to show you himself.
[3:08:25] He did to job. He did auntie.
[3:08:30] He did. He did to a man. The man at the
[3:08:33] pool
[3:08:35] was desirous to see a man help him.
[3:08:40] One day a man came to him.
[3:08:45] Do you want to walk says yes, but I
[3:08:47] don't have a man to put me there.
[3:08:52] Pick up your mat.
[3:08:55] He didn't.
[3:08:56] He just rolls up.
[3:08:58] [Music]
[3:09:02] &gt;&gt; My brother just lies up
[3:09:06] and pick your mat.
[3:09:08] [Applause]
[3:09:10] Amen.
[3:09:13] &gt;&gt; One day there was a man who was lucky
[3:09:15] enough that he had a a mine on the
[3:09:19] church on the you know in Malaw your
[3:09:24] position where you earn money as a
[3:09:25] mineh.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; Like we say we allow one person once one
[3:09:31] one one beggar to be at the door there.
[3:09:34] He will tell his friends I found a mine.
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3:09:39] So everybody coming in here will give
[3:09:42] them whatever small they have
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; and they keep the rest to themselves.
[3:09:51] Not change the rest.
[3:09:55] You know if a man has got 20 million in
[3:09:57] his account
[3:10:00] if he wants to give you money
[3:10:02] he'll give you 10
[3:10:13] money man
[3:10:18] &gt;&gt; so when we go around in the city in
[3:10:20] Malawi
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; you got you got 100 million in your
[3:10:26] When you meet a beggar,
[3:10:30] you don't give him 1 million.
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; No, you give him 10.
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; Man's help
[3:10:43] will never help you.
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; Stop looking for help from men.
[3:10:56] Men are very mean.
[3:11:04] Their friend is there. He's sick. He's
[3:11:06] looking for money.
[3:11:09] They are billionaires.
[3:11:10] But when they give, sorry, when they
[3:11:13] give, they give in sense.
[3:11:17] That's why he was perpetually there.
[3:11:20] Yeah. In year out
[3:11:23] in year out if you are looking for help
[3:11:26] from men my brother you be a slave
[3:11:32] because you need daily help
[3:11:37] but one day a man came
[3:11:42] and God have I none
[3:11:44] but in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:11:50] From that day, he never wanted anybody
[3:11:53] to help him anymore.
[3:11:57] [Applause]
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; Don't look for help from men.
[3:12:13] went around the NC campaigning
[3:12:16] to be president
[3:12:19] me to be president.
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; So when he became president
[3:12:24] there were about 50 people which he
[3:12:26] needed to give positions in the
[3:12:27] government
[3:12:31] until
[3:12:33] tells him, "Hey, Mr. President, what
[3:12:35] type of cabinet is this?
[3:12:41] What are the use of all those people
[3:12:42] which you have there?"
[3:12:44] [Music]
[3:12:45] Because he was looking for man.
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; Man wants when you he helps you,
[3:12:53] &gt;&gt; you should help him
[3:12:55] &gt;&gt; back.
[3:12:56] [Applause]
[3:12:58] [Music]
[3:13:01] Be careful of man.
[3:13:05] Be careful of man.
[3:13:10] That is why when we're going out of here
[3:13:16] him would invite a person of his stature
[3:13:19] to his house
[3:13:24] so that whenever he is also need his a
[3:13:27] person of his teacher can invite you
[3:13:30] know these things
[3:13:33] we don't invite people who cannot invite
[3:13:36] you
[3:13:44] We are people.
[3:13:48] &gt;&gt; So he was there at the door.
[3:13:50] Help me. Help me. I'm telling the truth.
[3:13:55] They were not helping him because if
[3:13:58] they helped him the next day should have
[3:14:01] stopped begging.
[3:14:06] Because when a man came
[3:14:10] to help him,
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; he didn't need to be on the door again
[3:14:14] the whole of his life.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; So what what type of help was this one?
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; That was enslavement.
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; So they can punish him with questions.
[3:14:32] Hey, what what what is the use of deputy
[3:14:35] minister?
[3:14:36] &gt;&gt; I know
[3:14:40] they don't have they don't even have a
[3:14:41] job description. They don't have but
[3:14:43] they just have to sit in the cabinet
[3:14:45] there so that they can also eat from
[3:14:47] what they helped.
[3:14:59] man will always be selfish.
[3:15:09] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came,
[3:15:11] &gt;&gt; he said, "Walk."
[3:15:15] That was the end. All your problems are
[3:15:18] finished.
[3:15:19] &gt;&gt; You have walked.
[3:15:21] &gt;&gt; You are independent.
[3:15:23] You depend upon your own strength
[3:15:26] given by God.
[3:15:30] Hey, walk my brother. Walk my brother.
[3:15:34] Amen.
[3:15:36] In we go
[3:15:38] brother
[3:15:40] sister. This is a moving day.
[3:15:44] Walk.
[3:15:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Walk.
[3:15:53] &gt;&gt; You've been begging too much.
[3:16:03] Whoever helps you when you are begging
[3:16:05] will never help you enough.
[3:16:14] Let Jesus come.
[3:16:16] Oh s you just fly. Start flying.
[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; They asked him.
[3:16:25] You know whenever something good happens
[3:16:30] some people celebrate some people don't
[3:16:31] celebrate. I don't know for whatever
[3:16:33] reason.
[3:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:40] &gt;&gt; When when something good happens to our
[3:16:41] brother or sister let's celebrate with
[3:16:43] them.
[3:16:48] &gt;&gt; You mean you their friend was sick for
[3:16:50] 38 years. They couldn't even imagine
[3:16:53] that he has walked. They should
[3:16:54] celebrate what what they wanted was to
[3:16:56] find 408.
[3:17:03] They should have said where where is the
[3:17:06] man who has made you walk.
[3:17:10] We want also to go and see him.
[3:17:15] Hallelujah.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that man will only come
[3:17:21] to those who are looking for him.
[3:17:27] &gt;&gt; Uh 92 my brother
[3:17:29] &gt;&gt; 92
[3:17:33] the same message 92.
[3:17:44] Now
[3:17:45] &gt;&gt; we know
[3:17:47] &gt;&gt; he only comes
[3:17:49] &gt;&gt; and identifies himself
[3:17:52] &gt;&gt; to those
[3:17:54] who are looking for him.
[3:17:59] Amen.
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; He doesn't go to those who are not
[3:18:01] looking for him. My brother,
[3:18:05] that's the way it will be. At his second
[3:18:08] coming,
[3:18:12] the world will know nothing about him.
[3:18:16] He will just come take his church and be
[3:18:19] born
[3:18:21] and those who are not looking for him
[3:18:24] will be left behind.
[3:18:31] &gt;&gt; He is only coming
[3:18:33] to those who are looking for him.
[3:18:37] Amen.
[3:18:39] &gt;&gt; Look for him my brother.
[3:18:41] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[3:18:43] &gt;&gt; He is working inside this church.
[3:18:48] People in this church are becoming
[3:18:51] eternal.
[3:18:54] So much peace within
[3:19:00] until the whole of South Africa is
[3:19:01] passing by without them noticing.
[3:19:07] because they are focused.
[3:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:13] &gt;&gt; If you wanted to see Jesus today,
[3:19:17] what will he be
[3:19:21] 79? My brother,
[3:19:24] if we wanted Jesus to see Jesus today,
[3:19:29] he wouldn't be having a certain
[3:19:31] education.
[3:19:34] He wouldn't. We have no record of him
[3:19:37] going to school.
[3:19:41] He wouldn't be an eloquent speaker
[3:19:46] because his language is so poor.
[3:19:51] The common people had him gladly.
[3:19:58] So
[3:19:59] he would just be a man.
[3:20:02] mood.
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; He would be
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; just a man.
[3:20:12] &gt;&gt; You not be having something flying off
[3:20:14] the nose, something
[3:20:16] hanging in the air.
[3:20:20] [Music]
[3:20:22] He would be
[3:20:25] just a man.
[3:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20:27] &gt;&gt; S would see Jesus.
[3:20:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sir.
[3:20:32] [Applause]
[3:20:39] Amen.
[3:20:41] We would want to see Jesus
[3:20:43] in you.
[3:20:48] &gt;&gt; Your wife when she sees you,
[3:20:51] &gt;&gt; she should see Jesus.
[3:20:59] &gt;&gt; Your children When they see you,
[3:21:03] &gt;&gt; they should see Jesus,
[3:21:10] &gt;&gt; the world
[3:21:12] &gt;&gt; should see Jesus.
[3:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we have song like that?
