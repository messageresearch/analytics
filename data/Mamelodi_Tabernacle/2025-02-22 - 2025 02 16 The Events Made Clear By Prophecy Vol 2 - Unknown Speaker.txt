to thank you all your prayers and our pastor as well um just standing in the Gap this morning he will come and see us next time so as you know I'm just keeping the whe turning amen amen maybe I can ask you to sit for a few seconds amen because I want to give you a report given you the report of already because when we were there we baptized 17 people but what what what amazes me that day Saturdays when we start preaching men and women come to the church and then we baptize people Sunday when we went again to preach the people that got baptized were [Music] me and then the sister or the the wife to those men said he we will see next time amen but we baptized men and their sons so we will go again the Lord willing I hope we will baptize those sisters was something that we not used to normally when you get to the place the sisters are the one that received Mage but something vice versa it was in a place called the highest place ever where we normally snow is in that area so keep on praying for this Miss and then God will bless you amen amen before I read the scripture I just want to give you my personal testimony what I've seen God did in my life well I'm Waking my head office is here Inon now in 2021 November they sent me to liting back in the mind to run safety in the project is the most difficult job inject but when I left my house I spoke to the pastor spoke to and then the bo here home to be with us in prayer since we started until this is the fourth year something amazing happen those that run the project here person I used to talk about it normally is he knows what I'm talking about in our experience there was never a project that can go beyond two years without injuries something must happen and we are used to that I saw God did a good thing or an amazing thing in the fourth year since I was there in the mind there was no in amen not even a first AG oh the people safety managers of other project came to me because they had many injuries but my team never when they come to me they said to me how did you do it because there's something that you see something that you know something that you do for things go intact because when they check an annual safety record they saw us being the lead and they gave us the trophy and this one came to me and said next year the trophy will be then I just said to him I was smiling said as long as I'm in this project I will take all the trophies then he said so 2024 the Mind gave us another truth then he look at me he said there must be a secret then there was a meeting because when they asked me in the meeting everybody was there then I answered I said to them I I I don't have anything to tell you that I can say you need to do this and that because that's what you are expecting that you must Shout at the people do the assessment you must be hands on I said to them I've done none but what I do when I left my house I said to God be with me and the team that is the first them the second thing the second thing every day when I go to work I call upon his name and before I sleep I call upon his name and then that is the only secret and they say if that is the case it's not for us then I said to them true is not for you but it's for me because it's my way of life that why God is even showing you that when you are in his way will be the result I just want to thank for to see God protecting us in premises so last week the Mind manager asked me to pray in the management meeting in my prayer I said normally they complain about gbv then I said that can be conquered only if you the manager said in the prayer only you the Mind manager you call us any more colleagues but through this prayer we must call each other brothers and sisters so last week Wednesday they ask volunteer to pray no no one is going to pray I need that guy who said we must be brothers and sisters he must for us because I for one I saw it working amen amen so our our impact out there brothers and sisters it's very huge don't look down to ourself sorry don't look down to our so when I walk there no I really walk feel like I'm working amen am because the people has seen God Amen we even baptize people in that area because of distance they are streaming but we meet I always give the report to so wherever you are Shine Your Light amen amen so you will see God doing wonders God Bless you that's what I want to tell you this morning we must experence as we stand to our feet and sing a worshiping song for to to to read amen amen thank you for my soul you Lord for me I want to thank you Lord for to me gra than you amen amen as we go ahead lead us in prayer for the word of [Music] God let us make man in our image we've got only one thing in our hearts oh God just to manifest you father [Music] it is my prayer this morning [Music] amen as we open in the Book of Daniel chapter 34 to35 amen amen Daniel chapter 2 from verse 34-35 this images this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which SM the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing flows and the winds carry them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smed the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen amen for [Music] amen amen you may be seated amen as you read 43 to 453 mixed with Merit L they shall mingle themselves with a seed of men but they shall not live one to another even as iron is not mixed with L and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever [Music] amen amen amen verse 45 amen verse 45 amen may God bless you I'm bringing the part two of the message I promised previously about events made clear by prophecies where Daniel had a dream or the king had a dream nebz had a dream Daniel had to interpret the dream but before he interpreted dream he has to tell the king what he dreamed about until all the people of Babylon said to the king no man from this world can tell you that dream explain it and explain it only God alone so goded upon Daniel gave him the dream the interpretation there amen so last time we spoke until to the is because we had Babylon and we've got Greece we've got met we've got Rome that was the kingdom of iron that's where we stopped and today we will leave those one behind and talk about clay and ir and about the clay and iron we will focus on the stone the stone that was cut out without hands and hit the image on theot amen amen so we'll talk about that stone today amen amen looking at the spoken with what brother say I remember previously we were looking at the prophecies that brother prophesied we saw all of them being fulfilled nothing is Left Behind I remember Pastor when was behind the pit last week he was saying the people used to reject brother B but today looking at what America is saying Russia is saying what is happening in californ to check why these things are happening and when they start to realize that there was a man by the name of William who spoke about this thing and now they are precise when you go to the YouTube Google anywhere is the voice of the Prophet because they've started to realiz this man only him said these things and happened amen amen it tells you that the time is no more anytime the Rapture can take but before the Rapture can take the CL and the iron should show as their colors the kingdom that should stand eternity should start because theend of this time it should be the beginning of ET well uh let me read what brother says on the 1th week of Daniel for you to understand what this rock is amen amen he said now notice in here at the end of this age now Daniel in the 2 chapter 34 and 35 [Applause] he watched this image with great consideration and he watched until a stone was cut out of the mountain without [Music] hands and it rolls down and smoke the image in the feet and broke it it never hit it on the head now hit it on the feet that was the end time them 10 to amen before Jesus Christ was born there were kingdoms the kingdom of Babylon of M and pers of the G and when Jesus was born was born during the time of the ruling of [Music] Rome during the time of ir during the hardship of worship he was born during that time died during that time ascended during that now the iron is stronger than all the previous amen was ruling the entire world to the world to the end of the world somehow somewhere it get compromised we see the CL covering the eye the iron is still there but the CL is on top you no longer see it with the naked eye did you notice exactly here just before Mr went out the the last Protestant of America in the Pres in the president which I doubt ever be another one but when just to show that just if people would wake up when he met the last meeting he met with Russia there were five eastern communistic count represented five Western countries Mr CRF was the head of the Eastern [Music] country Mr was the head of the western count and CRF as I understand and Been Told that in Russia the language means CL and means IR English there's your iron and cl will not mix and he pulled off his shoe and beat it the stand with it and everything else it won't miss but it's in the last days of this Empire that The Rock sto that was healed out of the mountain without hand SM the image in the feet amen amen amen well in the olden days even South Africa we were colonized by British amen amen and they were fighting with the buas amen amen there were time of Germany there were time of friends and Etc but since the CL is there and the IR is there they stand because it's scriptural Germany will come and pass France will come and F Great Britain will come and but Rome will stand until God himself amen amen it happened there withen andf it's now here with Donald Trump Donald Trump andir pu amen amen I think last week they were talking about the war in Ukraine they want to stop it Donald Trump Donal TR give Putin the condition Putin give Donald Trump condition and their condition does not come to a common ground because iron and Clay will never meet America and Russia will never agree two forces two Powers but Russia is the hand of God Russia is the one that will destroy the Rome and America Amica is the hand of God like nebz the of God punish Israel the last Kingdom of the CL is the hand of God to punish this Kingdom as brother Bram say the first messenger was Paul the last messenger myself we are the hands of God open the church ages I close the church ages When I close the church ages there's no other church is the life eternal is the wedding serer is the Millennium is the Eternal new jerusem amen amen so today don't be fooled what America is saying what Russia is saying go back the scriptures go back to the spoken way and hear what the prophet say that's where your answer is amen amen the word of God says when they say oh yeah thank you when they say peace peace and peace then destruction will come there is no other peace amen I remember when we were coming from we were talking in the Bible in the car then we were talking about how things are what brother say he said even America if can find the best of the best president nothing will change it had hit the point of no return like those men those soldiers when they pierce our Lord Jesus Christ on the when they turn back look at him they said to the people indeed he was the son of but that utterance has never changed anything has never made them Christian they said indeed he was the son of God but in their sinful life knowing him as the Lord and Savior has never Chang anything in their life like when our Lord Jesus Christ was going to the bottomless to the lost soul has never changed them the word of God is not here to change you did you know that you are not going to change no you are who you are you will remain who you are irrespective that is why you can preach a wonderful message and the entire church rejoice and say yes Lord this is the true message of the living but after service you will receive a letter that someone is going after a wonderful message can you see that Theon is not changing any people's [Applause] Liv maybe I'm talking about someone here that you are planning to leave go well the word of God is a light it's a light when it's a light the light just show you who you are it's not going to change you from a man to a babo aabon is aab and a man is a man but on the light you will see it better amen even if America can find the best president they say is Donald Trump do you follow what that man is saying if you don't better do it he's turning the world upside down but the moment he doing that that rock from the mountain is ready to hit this government when they speak about peace when they speak about democracy is when the destruction will come in everywhere he goes He Tes the image of ofala to show them encourage gism sorry gism and all those things you encourage them Donald Trump will restore the digity of America is not going to change the the stone is [Applause] ready amen don't think there will be peace that's right yeah when talking Donald Trump listening Trump talking speaking I mean listening they are taking one another that you talk and you are talking step on my that's not a peaceful agreement they have limits talk until here you go beyond here you will see who am I I grew up there in Lim next to that big church if zcc man want to beat you he says wait let me take off the bch it's time to tell you when I remove this I will deal with you once I'm done I put it back and then say and then start giving praises is and Donald Trump Donald Trump amen this is the world we are living in if you are expecting peace you are expecting [Music] nothing there's no peace amen amen so now I'm talking about this rock when this Kingdom failed the people of this world another kingdom should come in the unfailing Kingdom okay let me read from the seven Church ages brother says and the kingdom and that Kingdom in the in the days of those kings the god of Heaven cut a stone out of the mountain without hands that SM the in the fet and broke all the Gentile Kingdom on earth and the kingdom of Christ ruled grow and covered the earth and the Sea and the sky the Gentile Kingdom faded away like a thresh like the husk on the threshing floor in the summer time what a picture we are living in and that is true amen amen Lu NE amen amen lucky him when he had that dream and he found it through the man of God Daniel and he saw his kingdom and those that will come later and later and later until to the end he even soon the kingdom that is coming and will rule forever Nebuchadnezzar was a gentile but God gave an opportunity he saw that there's a kingdom that is coming and Rule forever amen now brother here says that kingdom is the kingdom of Christ will rule and Reign forever and [Applause] ever and that kingdom is the Eternal kingom God has just given us the opportunity to live in this world temporarily knowing that there's a kingdom come that will stand forever we are from that Kingdom we are that kingom now the 7 week of again the man of God says now because that they're in shape they're in shape in shape I've got this shaped here like the pyramid arising of the Saints makes the March into Glory you understand it now Christ The Headstone the rejected Stone the all seeing ey coming exactly like the Bible say and Daniel said he washed the this Gentile age until the stone come out of the mountain that wasn't C with they've never put a keepstone on the pyramid it wasn't cut by any man's hand it's God's hand that cut the you see it and what did it do it hit the IM right smoke in the and broke to Pieces ground it into powder Hallelujah am what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church to Glory at the Rapture because it ended the gentle dispensation God ended it up the coming of Amen H amen amen this Stone became the Eternal Stone am you know when you listen to what brother was saying you will ask yourself a question why this Stone you know was all over and the Bible says there was no sea or ocean did you ask yourself why there was no se if you did not thought about them but think about the two million demons that were caught in the river think of Hitler when he killed the Jewish and those demons were bound there the ocean and the rivers and the DS and the lakes is where the demon hi in the city to come the demons do not have the hiding that is the reason the demons hide there and the Bible backs you up there were demons that were bind in the river God said to Moses go to River before Pharaoh get there because Pharaoh himself is that big snake in the river he's connecting with it that is why in the city to come there's no n there's no Atlantic Ocean there's no hiding place for the demons Stone coming from the mountain hit the feet of the image turn it into p in other words the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar came to an end the kingdom of the me and the P the kingdom of the Greece the kingdom of Rome the kingdom of Russia the kingdom of America come to an end only one Kingdom that will remain eternally and the kingdom that demon does not have access to did you see the kind of kingdom we are in for the kind of Kingdom we are we are the kingom the new city I'm reading the future home the future home of the Heavenly bride the bridegroom and the Earthly bride is [Music] us then you see and the new Earth the new creation the new city on the hill with the throne it on the top okay the throne up there and the Dwellers all up and down all up and down on that mountain brother is's just talking about that mountain because that stone became the mountain but that mountain became the city that City it became our Eternal dwelling place when we are here we are going to that City soon Russia and America will fall on the knees of God wait for that manifestation Amen brother say now you now have you got it that city is the only Mountain nothing shall [Applause] [Music] hurt or destroy in my Holy Mountain said the Lord the city is not a cube it's a mountain and the width by the bread by the height are equal bre 500 Miles this way 1500 miles that way 15 1500 miles 1500 1500 so it's just a great Mountain like the pyramid is on the mountain when I was studying this I was taken the center of the world and then those that know the center of the world is right there in Palestine but when the people check they say take is like in the center and take is just next to to Israel so Israel is the perfect center of the earth brother say Abraham left his home looking for a seed when he was going up and down to and fr one of the days when he tried to make a one step he met the owner of the brother say where he met him that's where the city will not in Africa no Russia or America where Abraham met him that's where the city will come amen amen he said how many was here when I was preaching that message I said that when I was measuring the new city the New Jerusalem that will be 1500 M Square did you hear what I said brother was preaching he said how many were there when he was preaching because what of the days God gave him an opportunity and said brother there's a city to come Abraham has seen the maker I give you an opportunity to go to that seity brother Bram went to that City and take the measurement you have a man who was in the world to come [Applause] brother BR was beyond kitten of time and met the maker and the maker said

who does not protect his own wife I have a problem with you because brother you find and the mother and the sisters ganging up now the the only protector the when I hear that I really get frustrated let's talk trth the Bible says we are sinners you know saved by grace who saved us who saved us is Lord Jesus Christ in our sinful life and he made us whole He protected us to the devil irrespective of the wrongs you commit Christ Jesus protected you why if you think your wife wrong you you don't protect it you not felling some because the natural type the spiritual be like Adam When sin came into house with if you will say I will redeem it that unconditional love it mustn't go with condition because you are having a holy attitude Christ Jesus protected us you are here this morning because
