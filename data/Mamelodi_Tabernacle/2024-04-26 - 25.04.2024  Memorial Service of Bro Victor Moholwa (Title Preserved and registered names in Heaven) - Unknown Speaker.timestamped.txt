[31:54] memorial service
[32:00] it's just a
[32:02] service in in memory of uh the brother
[32:07] that has
[32:11] departed and then we just come
[32:15] together and then read the
[32:18] word and remind each
[32:22] other and then we read the word that is
[32:25] relevant
[32:29] with what has
[32:33] happened
[32:35] so as to console the the the
[32:41] family and the church at
[32:45] large and those who were used to
[32:50] him okay let me start by saying yes
[33:01] was our
[33:05] friend was a
[33:08] Believer as for myself I know him while
[33:11] he was still very
[33:15] young I used to pick him
[33:19] up section
[33:21] F take him to the service every
[33:26] SU until he got
[33:29] married and have children
[33:32] too but as brother
[33:37] says he has been very
[33:41] courageous in fighting
[33:50] this is the first
[33:53] man that led the team
[34:00] uh to fight against these evil
[34:04] spirits he will take them to the
[34:08] rivers to cut off the
[34:13] connections those that have got
[34:17] connections to the Demonic
[34:20] world now he'll go to the
[34:24] place where they were initiated
[34:29] cut off that
[34:31] connection and there was quite a number
[34:33] of them amen and there's quite a number
[34:36] of people that were were
[34:40] helped you know all brothers and sisters
[34:45] from so we're going to read the
[34:51] word uh and here and say some few uh uh
[34:57] words concerning the scriptures that we
[34:59] have
[35:04] read I would like us to read from the
[35:08] book of First
[35:10] Corinthians chapter
[35:18] 15 uh we'll start from verse 45
[35:29] First Corinthians chapter
[35:33] 15 15 starting from verse
[35:38] 45
[35:39] 45 and then up to
[35:48] 511 and so it is written the first man
[35:52] Adam was made a living Soul the last
[35:55] Adam was made a quickening spirit
[35:58] how be that was not
[36:01] first which is spiritual but that which
[36:04] is natural and afterward that which is
[36:08] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[36:12] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[36:15] Heaven as it is the earthy such are they
[36:19] also that are earthy and as is the
[36:23] Heavenly such are they also that are
[36:26] heavenly and as we have borne the image
[36:30] of the earthy we shall also bear the
[36:33] image of the Heavenly now this I say
[36:36] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[36:39] inherit the kingdom of God neither doth
[36:42] corruption inherit in
[36:44] corruption behold I show you a mystery
[36:48] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[36:51] be
[36:53] changed okay let's just bow our head we
[36:56] have our
[37:04] just
[37:05] to pray for the reading of the
[37:14] [Applause]
[37:15] word as we bow our
[37:19] head
[37:21] gracious Eternal Heavenly
[37:25] Father the almighty God Lord the
[37:40] great even tonight we are
[37:44] gathered for the memorial of our brother
[37:48] and our Elder that
[37:52] Mo and we believe that the word that has
[37:55] been read
[37:57] is ready for a
[38:00] purpose to confort the
[38:03] family to confort all the
[38:08] Beloved for the Bible is the only
[38:12] book that has ever been
[38:16] written that can tell us about where we
[38:20] come from amen Lord where we are
[38:24] going where we are going to spend it
[38:29] eternity our Elder is standing in front
[38:33] of
[38:34] us anointed of the Holy Ghost to speak
[38:38] to
[38:40] us Lord God Almighty it is our prayer
[38:43] that you
[38:45] anoint each and everyone that is in
[38:49] here for the Holy Ghost to
[38:53] flow and for all of us to hear the word
[38:58] we know the evil
[39:01] one always triy to take
[39:06] chances there was a
[39:09] time when the prophet of God was
[39:15] preaching an unbeliever was
[39:19] sent to challenge the
[39:23] preacher with the intention to hypnotize
[39:27] him
[39:28] to make him back like a
[39:32] dog but the man of God CAU that
[39:38] spirit and even so where that Spirit was
[39:42] hanging amen and he announced it to the
[39:46] church the man was paralyzed and carried
[39:52] out that is a
[39:55] warning to those that H
[39:58] spells while a man of God stand on the
[40:01] pull pit amen for this place is an
[40:05] anointed place is a holy
[40:09] Place Satan we command you to live right
[40:13] now you stand no
[40:16] chance as we
[40:19] commit this service unto the hand of the
[40:22] Lord the Almighty God for we believe
[40:26] that the way that will proceed
[40:29] here shall not return unto us
[40:33] void but it will accomplish that which
[40:36] is will please
[40:38] God father God we commit everything unto
[40:42] thee in the mighty name of our Lord and
[40:44] Savior Jesus Christ
[40:51] amen or you may be seated
[40:59] yeah we have read the
[41:03] word especially where the Bible
[41:10] says the first Adam
[41:15] was it speak speak about the first Adam
[41:19] and the second
[41:21] Adam but before I go there I would like
[41:24] to compare what I've been
[41:30] reading what what we have
[41:34] read with Luke chapter
[41:37] 10 Luke 10 we can start reading from
[41:43] verse
[41:44] 20 or can we can read only verse 20 and
[41:47] compare these
[41:49] two Luke chap 10 we read verse
[41:53] 20 not not withstanding in the this
[41:58] Rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[42:01] unto you but rather Rejoice because your
[42:04] names are written in
[42:06] heaven yeah now what happened
[42:10] here our Lord Jesus
[42:13] Christ gave his disciples
[42:18] power to go and fight the evil
[42:23] spirits they did fight the evil spirit
[42:29] the the disciples did fight the evil
[42:34] spirit and defeated
[42:37] them and they came back to him very
[42:42] happy
[42:45] so now he said to
[42:49] them uh not withstanding in this Rejoice
[42:52] Rejoice
[42:56] not that the spirits are subject unto
[43:01] you but rather
[43:04] Rejoice because your names are written
[43:07] in
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:09] heaven so my title will be uh uh the
[43:14] preserved and uh registered names in
[43:21] [Applause]
[43:24] heaven because here what he says
[43:28] it says your name are written in
[43:32] heaven now if the names are written in
[43:37] heaven then they are preserved in
[43:41] heaven and then they are registered in
[43:46] heaven so now
[43:49] death is not is nothing compared to
[43:54] that because once your name is
[43:57] [Applause]
[43:59] reserved and is
[44:02] registered nobody can do any work okay
[44:05] what we call death here on on this
[44:08] planet
[44:09] [Applause]
[44:10] Earth is just the departure of an
[44:16] individual is that
[44:19] we
[44:22] uh we had that ignorance
[44:27] we had that ignorance that when somebody
[44:30] has passed
[44:33] on we think that that somebody is
[44:38] dead but actually it's not
[44:41] dead it's just a
[44:44] departure the soul took its own
[44:50] Direction the spirit took its own
[44:54] Direction and the body took its own
[44:56] Direction
[44:59] we know very
[45:00] well that all of
[45:02] us are going to soal
[45:08] die but actually it's just a
[45:12] departure and the Bible
[45:15] says this
[45:18] Flesh and Blood shall not
[45:22] inherit the kingdom of God
[45:29] now the prophet
[45:31] says you know one day Pastor Mak
[45:35] said
[45:36] said why when we meet we've got when we
[45:40] have
[45:43] funerals why don't we preach like we
[45:46] preach every
[45:50] Sunday he says now if there is a funeral
[45:54] of the Catholics
[45:59] they do their Catholic
[46:02] thing if there's a funeral of the
[46:07] zc they will spray you with
[46:10] water you came to their
[46:13] F but we message
[46:17] Believers we sort of
[46:20] uh take
[46:24] up okay fine so now I will preach the
[46:28] way I preach every
[46:31] Sunday now I will read a certain
[46:37] portion where the Prophet
[46:39] says only those that are written in the
[46:43] Lamb's Book of
[46:46] Life by being
[46:51] redeemed right because the Bible says
[46:54] except a
[46:55] man be born
[46:58] again he will not enter into a
[47:02] kingdom now he says only
[47:05] those who are in the Lamb's Book of
[47:10] Life by being
[47:13] redeemed when when Jesus
[47:17] Christ uh came here on
[47:21] Earth he was not coming to show off
[47:25] himself
[47:28] he was here to reveal the
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:32] we now the revelation of the
[47:36] we was that people must receive that
[47:41] we and when they receive that weight
[47:44] they receive
[47:46] life because the Bible
[47:48] says who he who finds
[47:52] me find
[47:54] life now now what is happening is that
[47:58] now the word must be
[48:02] incarnated into a human
[48:06] being and then that word
[48:09] itself then gives that person
[48:13] life in in John
[48:19] 17 yeah remember here he says don't be
[48:24] happy because the demons
[48:28] runs away from
[48:30] you
[48:32] but what is important is that you must
[48:36] Rejoice because your
[48:40] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[48:46] Life After the
[48:50] resurrection he went
[48:52] up and then when he went
[48:55] up and then
[48:57] he sent the spirit
[49:00] down and then the spirit down he
[49:03] redeemed Us by that blood and the
[49:08] spirit remember one day he
[49:12] said he took a
[49:15] bread and gave his
[49:18] disciples at
[49:20] each This Is My
[49:25] Flesh and and then took
[49:29] wine and gave them and say itat this is
[49:33] my blood drink this is my
[49:36] blood so they ate his
[49:40] flesh and drank his blood but he never
[49:44] explained
[49:46] that now his
[49:49] flesh or
[49:52] bread it means the
[49:55] we the
[49:57] spirit means the blood I mean the the
[50:01] wine means the
[50:04] blood are we together so now he cleans
[50:09] his
[50:11] church by his
[50:14] blood now when he cleans his blood by
[50:17] his I mean his church by his
[50:21] blood the word that is
[50:25] preached it becomes too difficult
[50:28] for a human
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:32] mind it must go to a human
[50:37] heart and then there should be a
[50:40] spirit that come and
[50:44] interpret that word like in the book of
[50:47] First Corinthians I mean first uh I mean
[50:50] Ephesians chapter
[50:53] 1 Ephesians chapter 1
[50:58] if you read verse 17 verse 17 yes verse
[51:04] 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[51:08] the father of Glory may give unto you
[51:11] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[51:15] the knowledge of him see this he must
[51:19] give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[51:24] [Applause]
[51:26] and
[51:28] Revelation in the knowledge of him
[51:31] there's a
[51:32] spirit that will give you
[51:34] [Music]
[51:36] wisdom and the
[51:38] Revelation in the
[51:41] knowledge of him in other words you must
[51:44] have a
[51:45] knowledge of him but not through your
[51:50] mind there's a spirit that must give you
[51:53] that revelation
[51:57] together now let's go back now we are
[52:01] talking about the
[52:04] preserved and
[52:06] registered names in
[52:12] heaven if somebody
[52:15] depart we don't have to worry
[52:18] that the only worry that can
[52:22] come that we're used to him
[52:27] it it become
[52:29] difficult to accept his
[52:33] departure but as far as you know you
[52:36] need to know where you come
[52:40] from and where you
[52:42] are and where you are
[52:45] going you don't just leave you always
[52:49] look back where you come
[52:51] from and then see where you
[52:54] are then if you call
[52:57] compare from where you come
[53:00] from to where you are you will see that
[53:04] there's
[53:06] Grace God was merciful to
[53:09] you because where you come from you
[53:13] didn't know
[53:14] him and where you are now you know him
[53:19] and then that gives you now the
[53:24] forecast you know exactly where you are
[53:28] going you are you are waiting for the
[53:32] Rapture and while you waiting for the
[53:35] Rapture you
[53:37] know that now you need to have a
[53:39] rapturing
[53:42] faith right and you know how to have
[53:46] that rapturing
[53:48] Faith now when you look at back where
[53:51] you come
[53:52] from and and when you are here now I'm
[53:56] very
[53:58] happy because you have the
[54:01] Revelation and there are people who
[54:04] doesn't see what you
[54:07] see who haven't heard what we are
[54:09] hearing every
[54:11] Sunday are we together so now that is
[54:14] why he says now only those who are
[54:18] written in the Lamb's Book of
[54:21] Life by being redeemed
[54:26] right then in Revelation
[54:29] 20 I'll just quote these
[54:35] Scriptures it
[54:37] says and whosoever was not found written
[54:40] in the Book of Life was cast into the
[54:42] Lake of
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:47] Fire now that that tells you about the
[54:51] future
[54:53] now you know where you are and the Bible
[54:57] tells you
[54:58] that whosoever was not
[55:02] found written in that
[55:05] book then will be cast into the lake of
[55:09] fire then you know that now if you are
[55:12] not if you read Ephesians
[55:15] 1 verse 4 you know that the pastor
[55:18] always read that he says according as he
[55:21] had chosen Us in him
[55:26] before the foundation of the
[55:28] world that we should be
[55:31] holy and Without
[55:33] Blame before him in love now now the
[55:38] preserved and registered names in
[55:43] heaven have been
[55:46] chosen in him before the foundation of
[55:48] the
[55:49] world you you won't change
[55:53] that it's it's it's a predestination
[55:58] it's according as he has chosen Us
[56:01] in in
[56:03] himself before the foundation of the
[56:06] world that we should be
[56:10] holy and Without
[56:12] Blame before him now that thing you
[56:16] cannot make yourself
[56:19] holy it's him who has predestinated
[56:24] you now he has
[56:26] oberved and registered your
[56:30] name in heaven now now every
[56:35] Sunday the pastor reads this
[56:37] scripture in Revelation 2 R you know
[56:41] that verse 17 that he who
[56:47] overcomes now in other words you need to
[56:52] overcome then he said I will give him a
[56:56] h hidden
[56:58] man not just an ordinary
[57:02] man a hidden
[57:05] man now because you are
[57:09] preserved that Mana is preserved only
[57:11] for
[57:15] you and then you have to overcome not by
[57:21] yourself you are
[57:24] predestinated as an
[57:27] overcome right and then verse five he
[57:32] said having predestinated
[57:37] us unto the adoption of of
[57:41] children by Jesus Christ to
[57:46] himself according to the good pleasure
[57:48] of his
[57:50] will now let us understand
[57:54] that he says he do
[57:57] things he God do things according to his
[58:04] good
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:07] pleasure now he do things according his
[58:11] good
[58:14] pleasure and then what are those things
[58:17] he predestinated
[58:19] us now and he has chosen Us in
[58:24] himself now that that is why
[58:27] now we worship
[58:30] God we worship God because he himself
[58:35] has called us you know that scripture
[58:38] said he he he that he
[58:41] knew then he called them then he that
[58:44] has called them he predestinated
[58:48] them to a preserved
[58:51] life to a preserved and registered names
[58:55] in heaven
[58:58] [Applause]
[58:59] the pastor taught us about the citizens
[59:01] of
[59:03] Heaven now the citizens of heaven will
[59:08] start the citizenship here on
[59:10] [Applause]
[59:12] Earth are we
[59:14] together
[59:16] Abraham started his
[59:21] citizenship here on Earth and the bride
[59:26] his citizensh her
[59:30] citizenship here on
[59:33] Earth you remember about Revelation
[59:36] chapter
[59:38] 5 he says he took the
[59:43] book that is the book of
[59:46] redemption now that book of
[59:49] redemption our names are written in that
[59:53] book then if our names are written in
[59:58] what
[59:59] happened
[1:00:02] after he was through with the seven
[1:00:05] Church
[1:00:08] ages then he came down with the
[1:00:12] book and then he's
[1:00:15] calling people by the names that are
[1:00:20] written on that
[1:00:22] book are we together he has finished his
[1:00:25] job
[1:00:27] now he's he's having a
[1:00:29] book now he's calling
[1:00:32] people according to their
[1:00:35] preserved preserved and registered
[1:00:39] names which are in heaven so now if your
[1:00:43] name is
[1:00:45] preserved and
[1:00:47] registered in heaven there's no way that
[1:00:50] you'll miss
[1:00:51] it you you won't miss a Direction
[1:00:57] amen he said my sheep hear my
[1:01:03] voice and when they hear my voice what
[1:01:07] will they do they will follow
[1:01:10] me they will follow me so you follow him
[1:01:13] because you
[1:01:15] hear his
[1:01:18] voice right let
[1:01:21] me give you another example
[1:01:26] there's a time where our Lord Jesus
[1:01:29] Christ in Matthew chapter
[1:01:32] 25 he spoke about the wise and the
[1:01:35] foolish
[1:01:37] virgin you know about that but I'm going
[1:01:41] to read only two verses there in verse
[1:01:46] 10
[1:01:47] 25 he
[1:01:49] says it
[1:01:51] says and while they went to buy
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:01:57] the bridegroom
[1:01:59] came and they that were ready went in
[1:02:04] with
[1:02:06] him to the
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:10] marriage and the doors were shut was
[1:02:14] shut you know about the 10 foolish
[1:02:19] virgin five were wise five were
[1:02:23] finish they they were waiting for
[1:02:28] uh the the
[1:02:32] bridegroom then he says when the
[1:02:34] bridegroom
[1:02:36] comes those that don't have
[1:02:40] oil went to
[1:02:43] byy while they were
[1:02:46] out the bridegroom
[1:02:49] came that they were ready they went in
[1:02:51] with
[1:02:53] him in the marriage
[1:02:56] and the door is
[1:02:59] shut then shall the king say unto them
[1:03:02] in verse
[1:03:05] 34 on the right now is the
[1:03:10] Judgment

[1:03:15] father inherit the
[1:03:19] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:03:21] foundation of the world
[1:03:25] you see I
[1:03:29] said my my my my title is the preserved
[1:03:35] and registered names in
[1:03:39] heaven now he will
[1:03:42] say
[1:03:44] Come Ye blessed of my
[1:03:47] father now he says now inherit the
[1:03:52] Kingdom that was prepared
[1:03:55] for you when
[1:03:59] before from the foundation of the
[1:04:02] world now your
[1:04:05] kingdom was prepared for
[1:04:08] you before the foundation of the
[1:04:11] world and there's no
[1:04:14] way that you will miss the the
[1:04:16] citizenship of
[1:04:20] the are we together am and in verse 41
[1:04:24] more verse 41 and and he shall say unto
[1:04:28] them on the left
[1:04:32] hand depart from
[1:04:35] me you
[1:04:38] cast into the Everlasting
[1:04:43] fire prepared for the devil and his
[1:04:48] angels while we are
[1:04:53] worshiping we are a
[1:04:58] that there are
[1:05:01] those that will take a different
[1:05:07] direction uh if you can read with me in
[1:05:11] in
[1:05:13] Jude in the book of of
[1:05:17] Jude read I'll read only uh verse four
[1:05:21] now you see youve got two types
[1:05:26] there are
[1:05:27] those that
[1:05:30] their uh names are not preserved in
[1:05:35] heaven and you say you hear what he says
[1:05:38] he says depart from
[1:05:42] me ye cast he say they
[1:05:46] cast they are cast into Everlasting
[1:05:51] fire and the the other ones he said they
[1:05:54] are blessed of the
[1:05:56] father they inherit the
[1:05:59] Kingdom that was prepared for for from
[1:06:04] the foundation of the
[1:06:08] world right now if you go to
[1:06:13] Jude in verse 4 verse it says for there
[1:06:18] are certain
[1:06:20] men crept in Una a who were before old
[1:06:24] ordained
[1:06:26] to this
[1:06:34] condemnation you hear what it says it
[1:06:37] says they are
[1:06:40] ordained for this
[1:06:46] condemnation now you can you you might
[1:06:49] ask me a question and saying okay what
[1:06:52] what has that to do with the
[1:06:57] funeral and what has it got to do with a
[1:07:01] memorial
[1:07:04] service now I said when we started
[1:07:07] here that a memorial
[1:07:12] service has to do is to do to do with
[1:07:15] the Departed
[1:07:18] one now what we are reading
[1:07:22] here is what he used to hear
[1:07:26] now we are reading this in his
[1:07:30] memory because we used to Fellowship
[1:07:33] about these
[1:07:34] things he used to sit down and these
[1:07:37] things were were
[1:07:39] preached he knew that the is a
[1:07:43] bride and there is a
[1:07:46] church he knew that there is a a
[1:07:50] predestinated
[1:07:53] seat there is a cast
[1:07:56] people he knew that there are those who
[1:07:59] are ordained for
[1:08:03] condemnation there are those who are
[1:08:08] predestinated for a life if you go to
[1:08:11] verse six it says and the angels which
[1:08:14] kept not their first estate but left
[1:08:17] their own habitation he had reserved in
[1:08:20] Everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[1:08:25] the judge M of the great
[1:08:36] [Music]
[1:08:38] day are we still together what I'm
[1:08:42] trying to show
[1:08:44] you is that
[1:08:47] now you won't miss
[1:08:50] it if your name is
[1:08:54] preserved and if your name is in the
[1:08:56] Lamb's Book of
[1:08:59] Life so when you
[1:09:02] depart we will have a
[1:09:06] natural
[1:09:09] pain natural pain but the
[1:09:13] Comfort it should be the spiritual
[1:09:18] one I always
[1:09:21] say when somebody has lost the one that
[1:09:25] h he he or she she
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:29] loved the only way of comforting that
[1:09:34] individual is to go to the
[1:09:37] Bible and and and check the promises of
[1:09:41] God but the natural
[1:09:46] part you can't you can't you
[1:09:50] can't uh what do we say if somebody
[1:09:53] feels the pain
[1:09:57] it's not the natural pain like somebody
[1:09:59] who is
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:01] injured if somebody feels a natural
[1:10:05] pain you'll give him
[1:10:09] tablets or
[1:10:11] injection or you
[1:10:14] bandage but now the spiritual
[1:10:18] pain need a spiritual
[1:10:23] bondage and the spiritual bondage
[1:10:26] it's a
[1:10:28] supernatural you go right to where his
[1:10:31] soul
[1:10:34] is and feed that soul with the
[1:10:39] truth look you got a soul a body and
[1:10:43] Body Soul and
[1:10:44] Spirit once once the
[1:10:47] soul gets the
[1:10:49] truth and then that's the the the the
[1:10:52] greatest bondage ever
[1:10:57] because that's where you
[1:10:59] are that's that's who you
[1:11:03] are are are we together yeah because the
[1:11:08] prophet says the bride is himself
[1:11:14] revealed see so we're talking about
[1:11:18] those that uh
[1:11:22] uh took the wrong direction
[1:11:26] and those that took the right
[1:11:27] direction and then he says the rest was
[1:11:30] left for tribulation
[1:11:34] period whipping and wailing and nashing
[1:11:39] of and then he says that's the church
[1:11:41] not the
[1:11:44] bride let me tell you what's the
[1:11:46] difference between the church and the
[1:11:49] bride our Lord Jesus
[1:11:53] Christ came the were first phes they
[1:11:56] were
[1:11:57] SES and they were they were
[1:12:00] scribes now the S
[1:12:04] thees did not believe in the
[1:12:09] resurrection no they were they did not
[1:12:11] believe in the
[1:12:13] resurrection they say when you are dead
[1:12:16] we are
[1:12:18] dead you
[1:12:19] see and then that does those Paul called
[1:12:24] them uh
[1:12:29] fools the scripture that we just read in
[1:12:32] in in in in in First
[1:12:36] Corinthian Paul
[1:12:40] says when you when you plant a
[1:12:43] seed that seed must
[1:12:47] die so that it could give
[1:12:50] life so says now you fools
[1:12:55] you don't have an
[1:12:58] understanding okay fine what he's trying
[1:13:00] to say is that now there should be a
[1:13:04] seed in
[1:13:07] you the seed which is the weed in
[1:13:11] you and that
[1:13:14] seed uh must spare of its
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:22] own let me read it so that you could
[1:13:25] understand it uh let's read John
[1:13:30] 17 I mean John 17 yes John chapter
[1:13:37] 17 the difference uh uh between the the
[1:13:44] bride and the
[1:13:53] church uh brother
[1:14:05] okay chapter 17
[1:14:08] verse1 it these words spake Jesus and
[1:14:12] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[1:14:16] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[1:14:20] that thy son Also may glorify thee
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:39] now
[1:14:41] glorify he says now father the hour has
[1:14:44] come to glorify thy
[1:14:49] son that thy son Also may glorify thee
[1:14:55] now our Lord Jesus
[1:14:57] Christ was here on
[1:15:00] Earth so that the words that he
[1:15:05] speak should find a
[1:15:08] place you remember in
[1:15:11] John 8 verse 37 he
[1:15:16] says you say you he says John 8:37 you
[1:15:20] don't have to read it uh he says you
[1:15:23] want to kill me
[1:15:28] but you say you are the Seed of
[1:15:33] Abraham of okay says you want to kill
[1:15:38] me and yet you say you are
[1:15:42] defeated it is
[1:15:45] because my weight could not find a place
[1:15:49] in your
[1:15:51] heart see now he he he was bringing the
[1:15:55] word to the
[1:15:58] people and once that
[1:16:01] word get a place in the heart of the
[1:16:06] people then that we
[1:16:09] germinate and then when it
[1:16:11] germinate it becomes
[1:16:15] Christ now the difference
[1:16:18] now between the
[1:16:20] church and the
[1:16:22] bride the church enjoy the
[1:16:27] weed are we together but that we cannot
[1:16:33] germinate and bring the I mean and
[1:16:37] germinate and be their
[1:16:39] owner because when the word
[1:16:43] germinate it makes Christ in
[1:16:46] you and when the word makes Christ in
[1:16:49] you then you become
[1:16:53] Christ you see amen now when when he
[1:16:58] says glorify
[1:17:02] me he was
[1:17:04] saying the words that I
[1:17:08] preached let it be
[1:17:11] manifested into the
[1:17:14] people so that when you speak about
[1:17:18] me he speaks about the
[1:17:21] word remember there is the physical son
[1:17:24] of
[1:17:27] God which was
[1:17:30] Jesus and there is a supernatural Son of
[1:17:36] God which is
[1:17:39] logos logos is the Son of
[1:17:42] God Jesus is the son of
[1:17:46] God you this this is
[1:17:49] Harvest he's a physical Son of God
[1:17:55] but the Revelation that is in
[1:17:58] him is also the Son of
[1:18:02] God are we together amen now
[1:18:06] Jesus wanted that now look look if as he
[1:18:10] continues verse two says as thou has
[1:18:13] given him Power Over All
[1:18:18] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[1:18:24] to as many as thou has given
[1:18:28] him so his
[1:18:31] weight when it reaches
[1:18:34] you then it the word comes from
[1:18:38] eternity in the beginning was the word
[1:18:41] the word was the word was with God the
[1:18:45] Word was
[1:18:46] God now when it comes to you it brings
[1:18:51] eternity it brings the Eternal beam it
[1:18:56] and it forms the Eternal
[1:18:59] being now it makes
[1:19:01] you the Eternal
[1:19:04] being not this
[1:19:06] flesh
[1:19:08] no it bring it goes to your
[1:19:12] heart and then when it gets into your
[1:19:16] heart that word itself like when when
[1:19:19] the prophet says the word is now in the
[1:19:23] bright
[1:19:25] it means then then that word which is in
[1:19:28] the
[1:19:29] bride makes that
[1:19:32] person an amateure
[1:19:36] God are we together amen now if it makes
[1:19:39] you an amateur God then it gives you a
[1:19:44] revelation and then when it gives you a
[1:19:46] revelation he says
[1:19:48] now H you'll know what to
[1:19:52] do with that re
[1:19:56] now our Lord Jesus Christ wanted that
[1:20:01] people should know the
[1:20:04] word that is why if you go to uh to the
[1:20:09] day he was speaking to
[1:20:13] Peter he said to
[1:20:16] Peter uh before I me he started by
[1:20:19] saying to all who do
[1:20:22] people say that the son of
[1:20:26] is you see he want just them to to to to
[1:20:30] to to have a
[1:20:33] revelation of who he
[1:20:35] was not not really
[1:20:39] Jesus but the word
[1:20:43] itself are we together that's why he
[1:20:46] when he said thou are the
[1:20:50] Christ Christ and logos and the
[1:20:55] spirit it's one and the same thing
[1:20:58] Christ is logos logos is the pillar of
[1:21:02] fire logos is still the
[1:21:05] word so when he says Thou Art Christ
[1:21:09] then he was saying this was
[1:21:11] logos this was Pillar of Fire and then
[1:21:14] it was a revelation to
[1:21:16] Peter and then if if it was a revelation
[1:21:19] to
[1:21:21] Peter uh then he
[1:21:25] finished that's why he says now glorify
[1:21:28] me my last scripture my last scripture
[1:21:33] is here in the Book of
[1:21:38] Matthew uh Matthew chapter
[1:21:47] 22 from verse 41 he says while the
[1:21:52] Pharisees were gathered together Jesus
[1:21:55] asked
[1:21:59] them
[1:22:00] saying what think ye of
[1:22:04] Christ whose son is
[1:22:08] he they say unto him the son of
[1:22:12] David I'm sure you are aware that he
[1:22:16] says what think ye of
[1:22:20] Christ he doesn't say what think ye of
[1:22:23] Jesus
[1:22:26] says what think he of
[1:22:29] Christ now he was asking the
[1:22:33] Pharisees and then he said whose son was
[1:22:38] he is
[1:22:40] he and then they said he the son of
[1:22:44] David then he said unto them how then
[1:22:48] that David in spirit call him Lord
[1:22:57] saying the Lord said unto my
[1:23:01] Lord sit thou on my right
[1:23:04] hand till I make thine enemies thy foot
[1:23:09] St if David then call him
[1:23:13] Lord how is he his
[1:23:18] son verse 46 and no man was able to
[1:23:21] answer him
[1:23:25] now this
[1:23:27] question is the very same question that
[1:23:29] he asked his
[1:23:33] disciples is the very same
[1:23:35] question so
[1:23:38] now the
[1:23:41] consolation to the
[1:23:45] moers is
[1:23:48] that your your the things that we preach
[1:23:52] here
[1:23:55] your
[1:23:57] father engaged
[1:24:01] them and when you engage
[1:24:05] them
[1:24:09] then that gives
[1:24:12] you a supernatural
[1:24:18] encouragement that there is a citizen
[1:24:22] of New Jerusalem
[1:24:27] if there's a citizen of New
[1:24:29] Jerusalem according to the
[1:24:34] predestination we will meet
[1:24:37] there and the Bible also
[1:24:41] says uh the all those that
[1:24:47] slept they will they will
[1:24:51] rise and then we will see them
[1:24:55] and then our bodies will
[1:24:58] change now this ministry that you are
[1:25:02] having the ministry of the revelation of
[1:25:06] the seventh
[1:25:08] seal which is the power of the third
[1:25:12] pool gives
[1:25:14] you uh it inspires
[1:25:19] you as his as his
[1:25:22] children that's where you get the the
[1:25:25] rapturing
[1:25:28] Fai the Bible the Bible speaks
[1:25:32] about uh in Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:25:39] 19 it speaks about the manifestations of
[1:25:42] the sons of
[1:25:45] God now the revelation of the seven
[1:25:50] SE
[1:25:52] shows the manifestations of the sons of
[1:25:56] God and then that is the
[1:26:00] consolation we we don't have to
[1:26:03] worry home is sweet home we are going
[1:26:06] home all of
[1:26:09] us if if he
[1:26:12] teres of which we know right now the
[1:26:15] time and the signs are
[1:26:20] telling everything is telling
[1:26:24] and the word also is
[1:26:26] telling there's nothing Beyond
[1:26:30] this there's nothing Beyond this
[1:26:34] ministry we cannot say we're waiting
[1:26:36] another
[1:26:38] Revelation there's no other Revelation
[1:26:41] the Revelation is that of the seventh
[1:26:44] seity beyond that is a
