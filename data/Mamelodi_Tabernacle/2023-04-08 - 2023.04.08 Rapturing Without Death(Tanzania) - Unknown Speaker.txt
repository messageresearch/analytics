before I left Pretoria will this be the last time we will still meet but the science convinced us that this is the end of time amen by the children of God we have the children of God are rejoicing because we are nearing homes is the migration the Seed of Abraham we've been longing to go home for a long time okay so we'll we have arrived we are here as we say it is a rupturing without death let me quote it here by there prophet that is the Rapture page 20. paragraph 105. um there's a brother of mine who has sent a message to another brother in the church and they said tell uh brother godima and he loves to call me the Ancient One I don't know that's the brother not me now he said tell brother that this is the last mile of the way all right let me quote the prophet now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from from Adam which was a type of the church ages all of the rest of the six men before him died foreign [Applause] the servants Church age that takes the rapture and now there's no doubt we are in the seventh Church age we all know it now is the seventh Church age that takes the rapture all of the other six six died he's talking about the church ages foreign because he was not found he was not found God took him but Enoch Rapture was a type of all the rest of them now let's take this one the end time bride will be called out then he says out off then he says the rupturing without death that's referring to as the the remaining here foreign will be will be called out the seventh Church age which we are now bearing record of that age then he says my let's dig in now real deep please yeah I love this prophet of flowers Okay so he walked with God I believe we are also now working with God [Applause] [Music] and he says meaning he walked with God that is rapturing [Applause] foreign spoke of the rupturing faith I said to the children of God one day that we realize we are on the Runway you know the flight before it takes off it has to run away now I don't know we all believe that the bride of Christ is now on a Runway [Applause] before they take their flight very soon now Enoch the seventh man and the prophet says if you count days you count seven then after counting seven he says then what you come to eight now eighties going back you count that's why he says there's the seventh man the seventh Church age he says this seventh Church age is typed with Enoch he types it with Enoch we are in the seventh churches we all know it is the seven that takes the rapture so that means we are in the seventh Church and this is the seventh that takes the rapture [Music] amen in the book of this is the future home [Music] one of the great books by our Prophet yeah [Music] a future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bridge I will look at this page and may the Lord bless you I'm looking at page 31 here and sentences the eighth cannot be countered with the week [Music] meaning cannot be counted with the seven and we lived through these types [Music] but when you hit the Earth you go into eternity some people think that eternity that's when we die and we enter eternity but the Bible says if we believe in you we have eternal life [Applause] I'm not waiting for for my death YouTube the rapture in this seventh uh Church age we we are the last year [Music] the seventh Church age now according to the prophet yes we are not waiting for death we are waiting for the rapture he says he's the Rapture rapturing without death meaning working with him with God [Music] [Applause] we will walk with God like a Enoch he walked this God and he was not [Applause] that is the love of God with God and he was not foreign [Applause] because we are already ruptured then uh here we are we we are that's page 30. we are entering into that area genuine eternity it doesn't say we are going to enter into but we we are entering where the church is called not to some station or some denomination but into eternity with their Eternal King the church is called into eternity so we're here to represent all the church ages because we are the last do you know that we are the last [Applause] after us there's no more there's no age we are closing [Applause] so it says where the church is called not to some station [Music] but into eternity Eternal King and now you've passed into eternity where you come from okay as I say I spoke to a brother from Australia is one of our brothers from Australia and he has reminded me that we are or will all meet over there he also believed our journey is finished [Applause] our past into eternity where you come from if you come from eternity then the prophet says yes you have passed into eternity where you come from foreign [Applause] that this part of Ephesians is that Ephesians chapter one I think I believe if you find Ephesians chapter one now now we are talking about yeah eternity [Music] and Ephesians this uh [Music] having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has proposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen did you hear the scripture that in the dispensations of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now I read this picture 31. foreign into that real genuine eternity [Music] as the church is not called to a denomination or to some station then he says you've passed into eternity where you come from that's your destination that's where you come from [Music] if you've got eternal life there is only one form that's God and you are an expressed attribute not just an attribute but an expressed attribute then he says then you are in eternity where you was all the time meaning you've never left eternity you have never left he says you you have all the time [Music] but you've just recognized you were made for an eternal peoples that's why you can't sin you can go back to the world because you are made for an eternal purpose is in your mind is only thinking of about eternity I mean because he was the manifestation of an attribute in God you know it was in God and then now you are a manifestation and from God from the mind of God you are attributes to manifest the mind of God amen your neighbors are depending on you because you are a manifestation of the mind yeah of God of all what God thought you will be you are foreign [Applause] God said let there be light and he says and there was no light until that weight was manifested The Light Came as a manifestation yes pastor so now you have but I I could you know then you are in eternity where you was all the time okay now if you are in eternity you will believe that you are in Italian amen [Applause] your faith will manifested as you were made for an eternal peoples meaning when I look at you I see you from the time to the end you know if you look at the Christian you are looking at an eternal being [Music] oh my god when preaching to this eternal beings you don't you don't think of saying of seeing them leaving the church or living the faith foreign [Applause] you know in the world there's some people if you look at them you can say will this one last the peace amen but if you look at a predestinated seed because you are the children you are not the children you are the Seed of Abraham [Applause] so now it says here and you that that thought of you and okay let me take it from here the manifestation of an attribute oh God expressed you know God trusts his thoughts so much he even expressed his thoughts knowing that his thoughts will never fail he expressed them and and here you are an Express the thought of God how can you expect a falling away as you are looking at an eternal being no it says he made us to to take you out all right make you he make you a human being and sin come along and perverted his way but you you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you as you remember we were Redeemed by the family Redeemed by the blood of a relative [Applause] you the express attribute not just an attribute but an expressed and also redeems this Earth by the same way his purpose rolls on purpose [Music] now I read this part here now in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10. you are putting it down it's called not a dispensation not the seventh day is called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled [Music] did you know that seven churches speaks of times seven series speaks of Italian okay when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled okay that's why we are thinking of nothing but we are our mind now ball who is flooded with some thoughts for the rapture because we are in their seventh Church age as brother Brennan says all the others are now in the sixth Dimension we are the last year [Music] Okay so I will finish this the fullness of time [Music] now when you no more the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time again as you know in the Book of Revelation it says and their time shall be no more yeah yes I know my body is time now we want now when you go into eternity after the seven Church ages have you heard this one after the seventh Church age and it is [Music] [Applause] right now sometimes we think of yeah of Eternity or getting into eternity at a certain time that is coming but according to the word we have already entered [Applause] now a person who has entered eternity okay you can even see him by his works [Music] he cannot go back he's not a person who's going back come back with him confess and next time no that is not eternity a person who has eternal life the Bible says you cannot sin because we are born of God the Bible says he that is born of God cannot see if you know the word cannot why why because God don't tame us we are born if you are born an African then you are an African if you are born of God says foreign [Applause] from the book of adoption when brother Brennan says we are a match of God and I was hammered for that says we are God in our image God wanted to make you brother brother in creation when God arrived here at the men he saw that in that man it looked like him I don't have the book to read to you now amen when he was doing his rounds when he arrived at the mail God said the prophet says then he saw that in that manner it looked like him because he said let us make men in our image [Applause] that was the purpose and then it's this now when there is no more time when you go into eternity somebody's thinking of after death no we are not talking about we are talking about when you enter into eternity after the seventh Church age [Music] is over and it is okay so that's why we are not in the church ages Luther's age is over Methodist church is over Pentecostal age is over now you tell me that no brothers but it's over there was the day of Pentecost now is I see a building amen painted Pentecostal you won't find that Pentecost [Applause] Pentecost happened back there from the upper room now what they call Pentecost today is actually it's not Pentacles it's a denomination amen with the name Pentecost you know the real Church was started by the the real church is the blood of the Lamb [Applause] God bless you my brother hey I remember I look for a quotation sometimes I was in Swaziland and one of our brothers a brother from Alabama was it from Alabama from Florida he sent me that quotation he was also in the service but been there in Florida where others one is from Alabama the others of Australia and so okay now there was once a Pentecost now today you won't find that Pentecost [Music] you know as I'm saying people come together and say we want to start a movement for God can you no you can't start a church you don't have that blood to start the church it took the blood of God to build a church foreign not human blood brother we want to start them a new movement a new change yeah it's a new church but but this is human change foreign [Applause] okay now that's why let me finish to run it here there's something Church age is over when it is over and it is Luther's age is over and so if if something is over now you are reciting in the ruins of that something maybe you didn't hear it he says if he says method this age is over [Music] it means what is left is the ruins the rain you know if you leave your house you are going to start somewhere else what remains in that house will be the beds flying [Music] and so forth is open to everything that cannot oh Lord buy a house okay now if God has left the place only Birds [Applause] it's over now he says and now you go into what eternity no more servants me no more threes amen they are in eternity where there is no such time as numbers hey hey we thank God for Malachi that's why now he says eight cannot be contacted with the weak you count seven you've got to go back you have the seventh man yeah and you couldn't be the eighth man he went back then he walked with God and he was not oh this is wonderful book here [Applause] seven days [Music] only has to do with the old creation [Applause] [Music] that's why we are no longer in the church age [Applause] what our ministry the ministry uh the prophet speaks here of Revelation chapter 4 verse 1. what it says brother again I chapter 4 verse after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up either and I will show these things which must be here up brother Brennan says uh John he left the church ages and was taken up and he said come up and I will show you things that must be year after amen amen not just the church ages then he says he saw the church ages and left the church angels even if you read about the bride revelation 21. is that day is it all about the bride okay up and then came unto me one of the seventh angel which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen you see now God had started to show you things he said come he should he said come what did he say to him [Music] come come here you can't see the bride from where you are man come here even Revelation chapter 4 says then I will show you what I will show you when you have come here you won't see it from the churches foreign [Applause] I'll be able to show you things to come then he says immediately [Applause] even the bride God displayed the bride but he says so after and I will show you the bride then can continue [Music] and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God to see the bride he carried him in the spirit highest mountain amen not to mamelodi through the highest mountain to show him the bride okay the bread is not in mamelodi it is on the highest mountain [Applause] is a natural Dwelling Place the bride members that are in mamelodi naturally [Applause] long way the bright is not in the long way yeah the pastor confirms it yeah you'll find churches there but not the pride of Christ do you want to see the bride come up here oh come up where their seals Seven Seals Revelations yeah come back where there is God's revelation then you see the pride Okay so then what happened he said come up here and he and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God hey wonderful come and see the bridge then he saw a great City because brother Branham says bright is like Jerusalem it is built like the New Jerusalem you see the pyramid form that's why uh if you follow okay of course the message you don't follow because it is in you the people who follow sometimes they trip okay now he says the pride is built like the city of Jerusalem now they take the seat of Jerusalem if you read this book it's exactly like the pyramid [Music] and the top there is light the light will stop there and the bright there is she's a queen amen now you see if you find the children of God there foreign they can't sing because on the other side she's a queen the Bride is a queen have you seen the Menace of a queen the Menace of a queen now I read this part here my brother just offered me this one that in creation I must read it he offered to me God bless you sir complete creation he says when God was waking this the Masterpiece page 10 here we were that was a complete creation God working in a pattern but finally they came forth upon the earth a perfection and that was a man okay just go and read it the master peace it will tell you that finally they came upon the earth a perfection because God said let us make men in our that's why the prophet calls it a perfection and that was a man then he could see in that man you know Adam was like God's mirror [Applause] for God wanted to see himself when he looks at you he should see himself that's why he has planned you in that way let us make men in our image so that if we wanted to see ourselves we shall look at the man because he's in our image he is our mirror that's why later when Adam has sinned god king calling out Adam Adam where are you God couldn't see himself the mirror was no longer dead so he was looking for the mirror and the mirror was not there so he asked Mira [Applause] said I have sinned I have seen then the mirror knew that after singing it can no longer reflect it [Music] dead the Creator that's why a person after your sin is running it's just running even when you meet him on the street there was one brother he has left the church there in mpumalanga side now it was no longer coming to church now every time we meet somebody from the church oh how are you my brother yeah how's the pastor you know the pastor is fine God gave me give him this twenty dollars I will come to church yeah [Music] the pastor was receiving 20 dollars ten dollars and so forth but the Pastor said no I don't want 20 dollars [Applause] okay now here it is and when and then he could see in that man now we are getting the right picture not he could see that man foreign [Applause] [Applause] God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image that is God's achievement Amen in his image God wants to see himself in you that's why he said let us make men in our image you see I think all of us here we understand that God wants to see himself in US [Applause] we are only few amazing okay let me try again God wants to see himself in US [Applause] all right it shows that we are online that is God's achievement he wanted a man in his own image this message is rich okay now we read 70s only has to do with the old creation that is page 28 future home then page 29 he continues here seven days watch which passed away eight days with the new creation not all creation Eight Days a new creation [Music] amen now before we can lose we are here rupturing without death now this is we are the last people the others are already in the sixth dimension we are the people who will be taken up in the Rapture without death amen and I don't need to count how many believe this we are the last wish [Applause] the seven as as I read that we find indoor was the servant from Noah you take brother brand name as the seventh from Paul [Music] amen now we are in the seventh Church age he said and that is the age that takes the rapture but now we believe that we are here on the runway oh yeah then I'll find this scripture here okay let's take Elijah and this other one you say is you say Elisha or Elisha Elisha or Elisha just like that amen amen he also let's let's look at is it Second Kings right chapter 2. before closing without death yeah okay if I happen to pass on or the people are what they pass on will still be saying rapturing without faith [Applause] if tomorrow I'm told that brother so and so has passed on I was even at this funeral I will be preaching that this is this age we are the last people to be raptured without death okay now here is Elisha one day Elijah also started he started on a Runway there was an Uber coming for him [Music] then he knew that there's a chariot that is coming then just as we know that there's a rapture I'm listening to the pastor Pastor seizure saying we don't know whether this is the last meeting he knows that there is rapture [Applause] we don't know when but it is just here all right now this man the Bible says it came to pass when the Lord would take Elijah into Heaven by a ruined that Elijah went with Elisha he knew that he was going to be taken away but of course he had to to start working towards that you are working towards the rapture trying to do everything right amen trying to get right with God you know that it is preparing yourself because you know that the Rapture is coming um Elijah knew it that the Chariot [Applause] now he took Elijah then and it says and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to better and Elisha said unto him as the Lord lives and as thy Soul live Elijah knew that this is God's prophet [Applause] yeah as even the prophet says that soul is the seed of God it is the Throne of God now Elisha knew that God is in this man just as we knew that God is in this man the seventh engineering to talk to us amen amen what do you know is God is in this man to talk to us [Applause] amen amen and then it says foreign meaning as the Lord is on his throne I will not live to Elation the Lord was on the throne in Elijah so they went down to Bethany in that is the bride the bride knows and the bride knew where the Lord is you know before you can worship God you need to find his throne first speaks from the throne don't just worship anywhere [Applause] that's why people worship here today tomorrow they are there is the same thing [Music] you can't run from this lion to another lion if you fear that this one will devour you do this it's like running from denomination to foreign we are still running around the same thing only thing to take a breath you leave this one to that world you are tired but this one also you live for this one mm-hmm so now now Elijah like the bride of Christ you know the secret of Elisha he knew where God was [Applause] I will not live so they they went you know together if you can't leave him then you go together with him if you can't leave God then you will go together with God nothing because you can't leave God then the Bible says now they went and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said um unto him no he knows that the Lord will take away thy master from thy hate today That's History from dying head they say from thy head they thought that he was killing the prophet in his head and he said yes I know because it's from the head to the heart then he said hold your peace and Elijah said unto him unto and like him and Elijah said unto him Alicia Terry here yeah I prayed thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord and as thy Soul live I will not leave this amen they have tried to paint brother Branham with all sorts of paints but I could not leave him so they came together and the sons of the prophets came to Elijah always they were invited no we also have got us our service here amen yeah this one is going but we've got the service here they came to Jericho they were he was invited again said unto him no is that that the Lord will take away a masterful day and he said yes I know amen because he was an inward believer [Applause] he knew that God can take this figure but not the spirit [Applause] amen God two brothers but not the message [Applause] the Believers buried the body and from there they continuously singing behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day but in the days of the voice you see so they carried on because he took the body he took his Prophet but he not the message the message was already in their pride amen then lastly here then Elijah said unto him for the Lord has sent me to Jordan you know throughout the church ages The Same Spirit coming through and now it says and they too went on until they fit everywhere they come there were people there to inviting Elisha and the 50 men of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to view they came to Jordan then they they stood afar off to view amen amen even now you know after the bride has entered now in the constellation in order to be catched away there are some viewers amen so now they were looking down Jordan and only Elijah and Elijah crossover amen and they too went on and 50 men like that stood by a stood by Jordan and that's when Elijah now now they were separated Jordan and Elijah and Elisha on the other side even today is like that the bride already is on the other side but others are viewing from time saying it is not a revealed this is not revealed that is not revealed and they were on the other side too the two who are you this morning then on the other side of Jordan after closing jobs now the only the truth and the 50 green on the other side Elisha you sure knew that when they invited him that I am invited to a church on this side but I want to get to the other side amen because he knew that on the other side that's where he would receive what he wanted [Applause] okay then he says they stood by Jordan that's when Elijah took his mental wrapped it together smoked the waters and they were divided so that they too went over day two while we went over and it came to pass when they were gone over and Elijah said now ask him what I shall do for them when they were aware on the other side you must come to the other side [Applause] that's where you will receive it then he said okay now now we are here ask and Elijah took the mental or write it together smooth the waters were divided so they too went over then you see the children of Israel they were with there were some people there the Egyptians and so forth but only Moses and the children of Israel they arrived at the Red Sea as we were talking about them last time now they bought the token the token of the uh Covenant with that talking the the the the the what do you call that River Jordan recognize them because of the token Covenant you know God if you believe God he will establish a covenant do things because if you say I'm a child of God and there's no Covenant God is just is just a God but if then he established the Covenant then he becomes your God the Bible says so he said I will establish my Covenant and they shall be my best he is your god after an established family [Applause] that's why even the sea recognize when they cross the Sharks and whatever creatures of the sea [Music] they knew that the Covenant people are crossing [Music] [Applause] they had to give way the water respected the token amen you know every time when I was told about the Brothers at the airport this and that I want elaborate on that my brother came he told me yeah then the first thing I went down on my knees I said Lord the brothers are coming with the instruments to serve God you must get established then you can ask from God anything God will do it under the Covenant you must bet the tokens of the covenants you fear nothing God will always answer [Applause] yourself in their Covenant into the Covenant with the Lord around with a token they're talking of the Covenant all right sometimes you'll wonder after you have gone this way they told you that there was a lion follow you amen now you can say I bet I bet a token God will look after you [Music] [Applause] so video we've seen it now on the other side Elijah took the mental wrapped it [Music] I mean he smoothed the water and they were different divided so so ended so that they went uh over on a dry ground you know because Pharaoh was not so wise when the children of Israel walk on the dry land well I can also do it he was not wise you know and so he he followed foreign [Applause] [Music] does he recognize children of Israel [Applause] the men of sin the man of sin will only operate after the bright is gone [Applause] that we know talking about the coming tribulation his wife okay he won't allow his wife to go through the tribulation period she goes before that and you see now the signs leading to the tribulation period the Rapture is just here because tribulation can never start to operate the brother Branham says the men of sin he cannot her words start to operate while the brightness [Applause] God bless you as I'm closing here now on the other side and it came to pass they they were when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha what I shall do before I be taken away from thee learning about possible amen amen and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me [Applause] he was an inward believer s he followed until follow the lord until what you are in need of is manifested there's no way that I can follow God or follow the word of the Lord and the Lord will fail to answer [Music] amen just keep on following then you will come to the other side of all your problems when he was on the other side he said now ask amen amen you qualified to ask you qualify now you can ask you can ask and now what did he say and Elisha said hey let me hear this and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elijah ask what I shall do for thee did you hear this man believed that God is in the in this Elijah until this Elijah said ask oh asked what I shall do for thee under the third pool he didn't say what God shall do for you what I shall do [Applause] before I am taken away from you that God was there double pushing on thy Spirit be upon me and he said we have asked a hot thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from this you know you must follow until amen you know I followed we went even to the river even to mountains yeah we follow the prophet today to Sabine with some brothers and with the at the river where he baptized yeah I collected the water there as I have said we went to Sabino Canyon collected what I could collect from where the the prophet stood people thought I'm superstitious and they saw I took them there in my house [Music] I've got the water from them River when the prophet baptized the people and I've got a bit of soil and planted from the mountain there where he stood where he received the sword yeah I'm well armed at home okay God bless you so he received what he has asked because he followed up to the end sometimes I will look around and say I have asked God for this and that and that and you think that let me just relax no it doesn't say so it says up to the end now you don't come where you make your own decision say oh well God is God is God I'll carry on with my Castle as long as I believe God no don't carry on with it yeah yeah quiet here you don't need to endure you Just Keep On Believing [Applause] like that man come on we are told you a story prayed for a blind man you all know about it
