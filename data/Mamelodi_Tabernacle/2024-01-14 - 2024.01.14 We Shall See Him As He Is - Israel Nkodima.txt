Description:
Title: We Shall See Him As He Is
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 14 January 2024

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Genesis 18: 11 - I John 3: 2

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience that When he shall appear we shall be like him and see Him as he is.

If God has made you in His own image you will be happy to look at Him always. Because when you look at Him you see yourself. I John 3 verse 2 says we shall see Him, not see ourselves. 

The prophet has been showing us about the angels, but at the end he show us the notable one, because at the end we should meet the notable one.

When you are a Pastor and God has given you some people to preach to, when he preaches he is not in fear that the people can leave. He is preaching to the people whom God gave him and it makes him glad.

You want to come where the message reveals you, were you are presented. Moses also said that” this people are not my people”.

The true shepherd always makes sure that the sheep he shepherded are not his but are of God. In the heart of a real shepherd is that God must take care and heal the people.

When Jesus was asked about the coming of the son of man, he mentioned the days of Lot where there was fire and the days of Noah where there was floods. And today we have both these signs starting with fires and then now floods.

It was only Abraham who knew about the days of Lot and the days Noah.

If you find yourself still in the fourth dimension you are not in the rapturing faith. For in the last days people shall be lovers of themselves and everything that you love you end up worshipping it.

From the first utterance he said let us make man in our own image. So Jesus won't have to enter the beauty contest, because if he was to enter it is us who will appear. 

We will see God changing the bodies of the people. The pastor has realized that God is changing the bodies of the people and he has already experienced it.

There is something in yo...

then the matter becomes corrected [Music] thank I've been struggling for that I've been struggling for that for this son of mine to see the elders well I don't know whether there was a shortage of f or what it was not moving I repeat [Music] that is according to the Bible is it not like that brother yeah where all [Music] Sinners but the blood we forgiven if you and you come back to God he forgives amen amen so this is what the brother did and then the elders treated him as a son and also the wife he has to I also regarded her as my daughter we were all forgiven of our sins and trespasses so that's why the Bible says we also should [Music] forgive one another m now after he has seen the elders and brother reported back to and I was so glad at long last what I have asked for has been done for the Bible say one of you is found to be in the wrong he goes to the elders that they pray for him this is what they did that when they pray for then the Bible says he has been

Jesus Christ's name amen all right let's read the scripture Genesis 18:1 now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it cease to be with Sarah after the manner of women you may take your seats amen you may also take your seats God bless you uh this morning uh let us look at this scriptures for some few spiritual minutes as we have come here for to worship a worshiper for the Bible says the true worshippers shall worship God in truth and in spirit amen all right amen uh you know there was a sister here a brother approached the sister talk to her about this fourth dimension things the people love so [Music] dear and I read in the book that in Jesus Christ you are far beyond the fourth [Music] dimension amen that is I have read that one time now the fourth dimension Dimension you have all this things world and if you want God you go beyond that am that's why my image not the our image is in Christ not in the four Di you all know what is in the fourth dimension voices pictures and come you don't know all right let's leave it there that's the four dimens you hear there voices pictures and images images the images okay amen but the Bible says when he shall appear we shall be [Music] like that's why we as the children of God we don't want to see ourselves we want because he is our image that's why he said let us [Music] make he never the four diens in if God has made you in His image love to look at him all the time because that's where you can see your when he shall appear we shall be amen John joh 1 John chapter 3 verse 2 just read that part beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is all right I love this we shall see him he didn't say we shall see ourselves we shall see go further we shall see him as he is as he is and when I see him as he is then I know that's what I look like because he made me in his own you know he loved you so much until he made you in his own image amen isn't that love okay amen now I'll read few things and then before you think I'm preaching I would finish now the Bible says you know Sarah and Abraham abam the only man who has made who made was Abraham sorry for breaking off a bit I think it's not yet winter now there's hot air cominging me here all right amen winter is still still coming and we will prepare prepare for it now I will read a bit here um last week or was it last week all this time we're talking about the prophet of God was talking about the angel of the Lord the angel of the the prophet has been talking about that but at the end he ended with the notable one because at the end we too should see the notable one you end up with the notable one amen amen now I I read this part uh it was at the end of their towards the end of their journey and the Lord said I will certainly unto thee said unto Abraham Abraham was a man who could walk with God he was in contact with God amen amen amen God to him was the notable one and in his journey it was God who took him to the landing we are still coming to that the city is like a [Music] pyramid and that's why before we he could sumon us he had to put us in the P where you find the white stone in the pyramid we still come there because it is for the citizens now the gospel I will tell you something in the Bible the Lord Jesus spoke about the people uh that is 17 John 17 if you are a pastor and there's a congregation these are the people God has given you is that so that's why uh when a pastor brings his message it is not in fear that the people will live because he's talking to those God has given amen now if God has some people and he gives to a pastor a amen he will F make sure that the Sheep is very well known to the shepherd and the sheer so Jesus says my Sheep amen amen that's why a shf do not fear that uh there can be an infiltration of the strange sheep amen amen why because it is God who provides now I am preaching to the people whom God has given [Applause] me it makes me so because H they are with me they are the message of of this time amen am preaching to you is saying to you you are [Music] this amen amen now if I come with the message the message that is actually revealing you would you go away you want to come to where you are being presented and it's your I'm your image you are my IM when I come here I come here because I don't come say I'm going to preach they want to tell them I I go to him first because Moses said to God these people are not my people when God said Moses they should leave that place and Moses said I won't leave here unless your presence goes with us because he said because these people are not my they are I will only leave this place if if you take your position and me I'm just a Shepherd but the people are yours you know that's why a Good Shepherd will always make sure that the Sheep he shephers are not his they are of God that's why I went to bed bed [Music] late and because dealing coming to preach I do it the Moses way Moses way saying the people I'm going to preach are not mine they are your you know in my the heart of a real Shepherd it's for God to take care of you and for to heal [Music] you that's in the heart of yeah a shepherd a true shepher amen amen believe like I believe okay now let's read something here before we break not break amen okay I'm looking for something here uh you know they say in the days of the but in the days of the in those days and the days are passing by so much that I was looking in the scripture I realized Luke chapter 17 it says as it was in the days of in the days of brother Noah yes amen okay amen you'll realize that there was two things referring to the end time side you have the days and you have the days of two days now in the days of lot it was fire in the days of Lord it was water amen hasn't it happened the same way when he was asked about his coming he referred to these scriptures as it was in the days of Lord as it was in the days of no so we have both happened today it started with fire let me talk to the people this people it started with fire every day we were told about fire C and the match about California and there's a reason why all right there's a reason why there are some places the prophet of God not visit he will just say I preach once at a certain place but not return to that place I I asked some brothers and they can't answer that question and I said you see in this world everywhere what do you see terrible floods and earthquakes and what else LS come LS L lights lens lightss are happening daily but don't you wonder that it is happening but I'm residing and I've never seen one of suching where I am haven't you ask you that question I've seen them happen amen amen but I haven't seen it happening where I am if you go to the Bible things would happen but not where Abraham [Applause] was Hallelujah Abraham God would just tell him showed him things as we have read in the scripture that lot chose the sight of Sodom because it looked it looked what amen and Abraham now that's why the Bible says Lord went there before before what okay amen now I let me read this the days of Lord was fire the days of Noah was water and the Lord mentioned both as it was in the days of Lord he said again as it was in the days of so shall it be and it happened exactly like that to those who has had him when he spoke that this is what the Lord spoken all right amen can you see the sence the days of Lord I've seen them and have passed the dayses of Noah still carrying water all right amen now before we close H now it is only Abraham who knew about the days of Lord and his own days the days of Noah only Abraham knew these signs were given to him and when he saw those things she knew that it was according to the spoken spoken is that right now before we end up here now in our day like today this morning if you are still in the fourth dimension and following those things wanting your your to see your image and the image of your baby the image of your amen you are not in the rupture in I want to see if I have a baby my my baby if I have a baby I love to play with my baby not toship my baby am have you watched that everything a person would love he ends up worshiping [Music] that if you love yourself you end up worshiping yourself are you here that is the Bible in the end time people shall be lovers all amen of themselves by T amen amen now everything that you love you end up worshiping if you love God you end up worshiping God because you [Music] love [Music] you know it goes into the into the heart the heart of the Father the love of the father they told me of a sister and she's here that a brother approach her and said sister just take your images of out of this and I understand she did that and I said is that so uh because only a daughter of God can do that all right amen have you ever seen the ALB of the Lord Jesus Christ he's God he could have made a big album but you became this is that not [Applause] so he made you to be like him amen mhm amen from the first urance what let us make men in our [Applause] [Music] image so that if he is made in the [Music] image then he will he make us in His image then he don't have to enter the beauty contest he W because if he tries to do that it's us who will appear because he made us his now if he was to enter there beauty contest who would appear when he looks at us he he he sees himself so he doesn't need any beautiful he knows that it's him who's going to appear amen don't let the mirror deceive you in Christ you rejoice because it says when he comes we shall see him as what does that mean we shall see him as he is he doesn't change beautiful if he were changing like that would every time try to see him in another image they say he's still the same even today the thing is the divine nature the divine nature there's some people here young people they've got one has four cell phones another one has three a brother one time approached me and said brother he wants us to buy him a cell phone I said don't do that why knowing that is going to hurt him further because it's not for the Divine use he's going to use it for girlse I said don't buy rather by him amen did you hear it no they say but they say my Bible my

talk about him because he made me In His Image we were I will tell you something before we close a sister she was without hair just the froner now I said sister see you don't have then I put my hand now I'll tell you something before the almighty God the hair grw instantly but I'll tell you something there were some people with me when I looked at them sort of confused one of them was sort of confused as if nothing is happening I felt the hair going through my my fingers it grew like that the sister worships here I I don't know she's here but I don't know whether she is still with that God did that to her H I don't know all right amen uh let us let me let me leave that there's this brother he said he he had a problem with legs now we when we met I touch those legs that that is a prayer then he recovered before our eyes then they pH me that the brother I think it's the brother who phoned me saying you prayed for me I got he but it seems like the same condition is back with me now because it was through through the phone I couldn't talk to him now I want to see that brother to tell him that brother there's something that is blocking it's in you if it is sin then you need to confess that thing then you I won't pray for you again just confess and that that will remain with you let us finish here okay I have something to say to [Music] you those that God has given me for a fellowship you are the only people I can fellowship with and I am glad there's something here I want to share with you uh I don't know because I was doing things until this morning okay well here more we are going to see God changing the bodies of the people amen although I I have realized that already we are changing did you know that yes amen I don't know about you God is changing my body I have experienced that and I know because the Bible says for we shall change in the twinkling of an eye but the message to change you is already here it's already in you what you are waiting for is the day of the actual change okay amen and that my friend was right when he said I see brother is in a hurry to go the winess is here and I I said that's true I mean to you know there is something in you that's pulling you you want to see Jesus why because you came from him and he has made you in His image that's why there is a pool what is a pool something in you you want to see him you want to meet him because you were made in His image if you need a mirror he's my mirror the Lord Jesus is my mirror amen amen I'm talking to you while looking for something but if I can't find it still I know I know what I'm talking about okay that's why they call it the third something is pulling from the things of the world amen amen it's not yourself but it's something in you the power of the Resurrection the power for change you know sometimes I was saying now recently a sister sister has seen one sister with high heels the highest heels after that she also bought them or I don't know she was fine all this time without those high but because she saw that then she thought ah okay oh no I'm really cheating on myself now a person who has seen Christ cannot take his eyes from Christ amen we are not searching for beauty no we want to see Jesus that's all what are you searching for Christ all right amen because if it is you are after Christ you'll be like him all right amen uh I was told talking about but I'm not talking about the name of any person today I'm told I didn't know about it a person can put on socks and you will not be able to see them they call them oh secret secret socks yeah secret socks hey there's Mysteries [Music] today okay I'm not talking about my brother woman I saw I'm not targeting any the thing if you look at the legs there you don't see any socks now I as it was my first time to see that all right amen and but you have to your your your your your trousers has to hang up and those who know about it they know that if you see us hanging up like this that means he has Secret I said hey are we that far meaning that is just in the mind of a man because you don't see those socks says it's Secret I said yeah this is the last days there are some closing here there is some here they can go in the evening to have drinks they worship now now is the you will never change them you can preach and preach they don't change you can't change because a thing that can be changed a thing that was made in the image that you can change because I can change this jacket when maybe it's dirty I can wash it back to its color amen amen the only thing I can do is to wash off because inside I know there is original color now since now it is oily I know that is not its original should I remove this then I will approach the original color if a man is a sinner but if this man or this woman is predestinated then the Lord Jesus came knowing that with his blood that man or that woman can be washed and the original color will appear the person who used to drink and swear and all that next time you find him [Music] singing amen the power the power is victory over sin and Purity Divine the power oh the power of the power of the power you wonder is that this men are used to we used to meet at a certain what has happened the Lord Jesus there is power powering Power in the preious Blood of the Lamb there is power power oh Wonder awaking Power in the preious Blood of the amen amen amen now that's why this one came and said he touched [Music] me now as we are closing he can touch you change you amen amen because they predestinated they want to be like him all right amen the people some people came here worship and later Left Right amen but not a son of God a Son of God once he is convinced he get converted that's all he is back with his creator you can't change from salvation to Salvation you can't change from God to God what in God eternally in God once the blood has washed you et you don't come to M and say I was washing the blood in M but now I'm de again then you go somewhere else to be wased again no you haven't met him once the blood it flows eternally since Jesus came into my heart Jesus came into my heart I've got joy in my soul and Jesus came uh okay you'll know one day that since Jesus came into your heart your heart what has taken place the Clouds of Joy you know I talked to to him even when I am alone I talk to him but my scripture is revelation 21 the Tabernacle of God will be with me that's my daily scripture amen amen now today I have just crossed here then I'm going back to the White Stone going further because we have crossed the Evangelical line did you know that we have passed the Evangelical we are now on the other side you you will realize why we are talking about the Angels amen amen even himself he stopped talking about himself as a prophet but he was talking about the notable and he was talking about the angel brought into the just Angels Angel have you entered that area if you enter in that area you will never go back amen amen once you are in the Pyramid of the Angels you will never hear anything outside of that you just car on wanting to hear hearing because we have crossed Evangelical line on the other side the not one and the prophet kept on looking at the not let's close to come back to those things on because you know I left a page here I don't know I'll bring that page where it speaks of uh you know he [Music] was a representative no no no mediator a mediator amen we'll come to that because it says when today when the seven seal is open he is no longer immedi I'm glad God would allow me to read it now because we are coming to that show what that's why the ministry is just Angel angels because a mediator is a mediator I'll show you something listen I won't read now but you haven't understand this the lamb took the book from within then from there you understand because it says and here he is he was imediator on the Altar for the people just a little longer then he says but now he comes from here from The Altar and the last seal he is no more a mediator that's why as a mediator that's why where where somewhere he says the took the book within himself we look at that and even the day of redemption did you know when is the day do you know that when is the you don't know when the book is open when the book is open the day of redemption the day the book now which book because you have the Lamb's Book of Life book of life now the day the book is open that is the day of redemption amen meaning this ministry now is only to the redeemed if the book was open meaning the message is for the redeemed now the redeemed what is redemption it introduced those who were there for the foundation of the world now when they are redeemed meaning that they are back where they were Al are still here are still in this bodies of Flesh inside is a redeemed person this redeemed person you will see the nature divine nature that is with this man or woman not being about the redeemed redeemed is to take back where it was that's why a person can come collect some quotes and go amen amen all right amen and one can come then later he says I have left BR what you don't need to ask question you just look at yeah see explain that you are no longer in with the message of God now because you are outside you call it a c but you'll pay for that calling the word of God you will pay for that can men mock God they have done it and they paid heav all right cult calling the word of God you will pay every price it happened even in the Bible God bless you Saints amen
