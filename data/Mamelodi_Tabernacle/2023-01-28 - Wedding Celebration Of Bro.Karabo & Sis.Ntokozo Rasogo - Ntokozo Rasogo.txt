sisters and brothers foreign I don't know anymore amen we we are just going to read the scripture and just to say some few words all right [Music] okay foreign no by yourself okay all right the family is God bless you firstly let us just stand up for the reading of the words and let's take this scripture today First Corinthians chapter 11. verse 7 to 12. we have our and I hear oh you are here bro I don't know if a chair can be arranged for you here or is it right the way you know yes yes yes okay um First Corinthians brother chapter 12 chapter 11. verse 7 to 12. I don't know whether you are going to go in two languages or one I don't know but the language the language yeah or English and so too okay all right [Music] for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the baby neither was the name of nature for this course or the woman is supposed to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless never The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the world for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by all things of God okay and then we have our Elder here just to say a word of Prayer yeah after the reading of the way fine when my father everyone about that there will find by all means to stop whatever you want to explain the father for all on behalf a lot about the king never said foreign let us take the second scripture collaborative Ephesians chapter 5 verse 30. and I will will take it from the study they're not willing okay and 233 foreign [Music] this is a great mystery but are still considering Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so that his wife even as himself and the wife's industry whether it's okay you may be seated God bless you all well thank you sir thank you now you know or officiation yeah it's not like preaching now we are not here to preach era I think the The Crickets will need them afterwards but for now God bless you you know if you can't be happy on your wedding day you will never foreign but we are here for the restoration of brother and sister dogozo yes is there a great day they are restoration day you know the last time they met foreign [Music] [Music] the law of restoration that the two separated in Eden shall be restored amen now Julie you know brother this is your answer today amen amen according to the law of God you'll never marry another woman fella the Bible says the woman was created foreign uh especially this book of Ephesians especially that we are living in the day of destruction of marriages things start with joy but they end up destruction [Music] and there's a reason why we don't do it in the God's way it ends up a destruction amen amen all right now let's go according to God's plan for the true you know when God created man says the woman was created for demand amen amen meaning that your wife is from originally from God created specially for you now I'll tell you that a person like you take uh who was that woman there Abraham said was it Rebecca Rebecca who was that woman Rebecca all right you know how Abraham send out the elders in his house [Music] and he said go and find a wife for my son Isaac massage [Music] uh actually I was not to look for a wife that was to find them now to find the meant that they that she was there already [Music] amen and then when he arrived it was at a well in the evening time the time when women came to collect water and now one other Mysteries of the whole thing when he found Rebecca what time in the evening you see amen why because in the evening time that's when she has done all her daily duties and then if if maybe she went into town dressed for going into town arriving in the evening time you know she she should not be in her business you know evening they take off that because it's time for them to do their home duties now you realize that no she was just at home evening time to do the evening duties as a young woman when she was found it was in the evening yes she was not dressed to kill me she was just dressed to be buried or to be found because what the messenger looked for was not A well-dressed woman but was a predestinated woman who's in the plains of God all right I wish that thing would still remain the same yes created wife especially for him Now you listen before [Music] that is efficients for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones amen amen do you agree with him for this course a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife you know the reason why it says he shall leave his father and mother foreign amen uh he was created not born Adam was not born but was created amen okay yes now before he could get married it says for for this course shall a man leave his father okay amen amen did Adam had a father now Adam who's his father okay but fella it was something immediately that was coming now he shall leave his father and mother because originally he had no father in mind he was created all right amen that in the plan of God man was not born came by permissive permissive will of God who after the serpent has marked the plan of God in the garden foreign but the merciful god came with the law of restoration because God cannot be defeated all right amen so the law of restoration is to restore what the devil has marked says no for few minutes the only way you can marry your wife amen otherwise you can just marry me that's why we have uh the marriage officer a marriage officer and the divorce court clearly did we need divorce Quotes no it was not so much we had only the marriage officers and the Lord Jesus says when they asked him about you all this he said Moses because of the hardness of your hearts he allowed you to live your wives and marry another one so far but because of the hardiness say so and then now but he says but it was not solved brother do you know that scripture get me that scripture it was a question start with the question what did yes [Music] he said for this question through his wife and they try to shall be one flesh wherefore they are normal training but one flesh one death of God has spent together I mean we are still here men shall live is the Lord Jesus repeats and shall shall do I mean all right amen now it was to his not his girlfriend no his wife amen because when they were created it was it was not a man and girlfriends it was men and his wife all right now they ask a question why did Moses read that one they are awake he said unto them Moses because of the happiness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was amen right amen you see yeah speaking is God himself from the beginning it was not song Amen is after the beginning then these things happened even Moses had to give out a decree a decrease all right okay now the one who came was now not Moses now it won't be a simultaneous but the Creator in the form of inner body massage all right no he came but to restore that's why the true relationship in marriage can only come under the seventh seeds under the revelation of the seventh sins it brings back the it brings them back to the original is that true amen all right uh that's why if a young man getting married without Christ his disaster do you know that anything that is done without the Creator is disasters okay [Music] because it is not original amen amen you know even when going to buy things we are always looking for Originals [Music] there is this car that you can buy cheap foreign foreign because they tell you that once is driven out of the garage next fella that's the end you can't return and say no it's doing this yes [Music] call them that's I think everybody wants a a a a new wife I think everybody would love it we all want would love to buy a new cars because we can't manage we end up buying something else [Music] you don't know about the former owner [Music] it will come with some things maybe you know sometimes people after buying a car he takes it for sure amen amen and then then the second owner um there are things contradicting because perhaps you come you are a Christian and then you buy a second which went through some things it's something very different but God wanted us always wanted us to be to get married to who to to your wife amen now let's hear this for this course shall amen Now you listen what cause we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones now for this cause of being members of his body for that course uh for this course shall a man leave his mother and father because originally he had no father and mother now for him to qualify he shall leave his father and mother foreign right what do you call it a second the seventh second Covenant the second Covenant now under the second Covenant God says now for this course uh and you shall leave your father and mother because that is not original originally you had no father it means that you are also now surely the head of your family but it doesn't say did your father we should understand but meaning that you are no longer your father and mother you are also taking the headships all right amen you also are becoming a father amen all right amen now if you are married and coming home and say my father says you'll be reported you're telling me about it you see my father says now you are beyond that now are you still in respect of your father yeah buy them but you are also now amen you have a family now looking after your family now let me finish by saying for this course shall a man live father and mother and shall he join unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh that's why can one flesh divorce itself now are you married okay can one flesh divorce itself no so that's why it says they shall be with one flesh and it will be something out of this world to hear one flesh sayings I'm going for divorce to divorce itself because it is right amen now if you and your wife you came from God Amen he has already prepared you as a husband and here as your wife amen [Music] foreign and what happened he resurrected again and gave gifts to men [Music] and you know on his Ascension Day he was lifted up in a cloud and the Bible says he went to the highest heaven and gave gifts to me I'm that's why you cannot okay s n s n and only one but it's just but but you ancestor the Lord Jesus is not your and sister ancestors yeah amen that's why you don't go to the graves amen yes and the Bible says he is in there is that right amen okay amen now we we we are going to reach in order to bless this wedding foreign I think she's ready with that song where are you where is today I think she's ready God bless this couple who married today okay amen now I'm finishing here brother it's a blessing for the two of you now to be one flesh but in Christ under the seventh seed this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church Christ and the church Christ y amen amen you know in everything God will uh compare things out of Christ he is the head of the church amen yes sir so now nevertheless let everyone of you in particular Soul love his wife now you've got how many loves you now which one is real agabo Real Love Is can be deceiving food all right I had one young man saying you know me I I I'm either going to marry uh nursing essay [Music] or a teacher how about a teacher then I said but we are in the on the wrong road the Bible says you marry your wife [Music] amen amen even a wife let me sad a true wife do not agreement when a rich person who advanced on here all this is done without Christ in Christ you marry your wife amen not because of amen because she is yours rich or poor or whatever all right amen now let's finish nevertheless let every one of you in particular um so love his wife which love is this himself uh if he loves his wife as himself now you watch right there yes I love myself why why all right he says worry he loves himself why it's harder because of what Christ made him to be amen if Jesus comes and says the Bible says he laughed us so much even he died for us that's why we love ourselves because he died for us I love what I am in Christ amen the reason you love yourself it is because you are in Christ and Christ is in you love yourself amen all right love his wife even as Godzilla himself and the wife see that yeah she referenced her husband the Bible says maybe like Sarah who's son Alyssa Godzilla she respected her husband [Music] okay I mean now here we are coming to marry the two yeah and we realized that if I'm here officiating if they were not Christians I would do this in fear because but if they are Christians then I marry them as a restoration amen that it is God who did it all right amen you can help and like saying when they come they they will call gogori uh one of their relatives a um please please behave yourself why are they ask asking her to behave what's wrong brother when buying a car from the garage we ask you ask you no allowed me to finish it now John it leaves somebody with a doubt I've hated this terminal s yes but they're giving them instructions I believe that um God instructed us fully but if we are Christians we we come from God having received all the instructions well our good parents also will continue to save myself the way we have taught you already amen you know it is like watering a tree and you know that the fruits the these three we will yield the fruits [Music] help my tree to yield fruit no it is its nature amen if my child like my son here a ball in especially in the Christian family [Music] listen how much tool and you know what happens like the film stars Elizabeth Taylor and getting married to Richard Burton Richard Burton they don't change names they don't share Elizabeth Taylor will never take the uh Elizabeth Taylor Taylor each and everyone has his own lawyers [Music] because our they are not sure of their marriage they can break anytime okay let's do
