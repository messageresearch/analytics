TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as i greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] amen is there somebody interpreting here i hear another voice oh okay okay okay all right we thank the lord for the service this morning and their service yesterday and the service before the foundation of the world paul was preaching and the service that will come in the new jerusalem you know i was talking to some young men at home i think even i mentioned it even last night i used to weigh 105. 105 kilos i'm saying i used to weigh 105 [Music] then i said i don't want to be bigger than my theophany [Applause] again because the rapture is coming so i want to fit in [Music] for the the bible says narrow is the way really everything we won't be long but although god will help us to be specific straight to the boys amen amen especially that we have now arrived at the employer [Music] amen i think the believers have had when their seventh angel may say messenger these words then he said now let us he said you are we are now let us go the kitten of time foreign uh [Music] now this one dies the third one which is called the body mainly amen no matter how we love eden [Music] i can type to you that every time you buy a new car you are thinking of insurance is that the truth now when a child is born the first thing is fear for the child in the world of the unbelievers they will start calling in younger son gomer in what word because of fear fasting babies [Music] stand up for the reading of the words we are going to look into this but it will barely benefit only the one [Music] who has come to the end it felt like it goes we've got some believers that are still thinking of the time to come recently [Music] and then we have these believers who have already arrived like when enoch arrived or in the office then he walked with god and he was not me amen god took him god took him now we are looking at elisha when the time arrives he took elisha with him [Music] [Music] amen really to be with people of your nature or calibre so looking at my wrist watching the relationship heavenly father we come to thee again this morning we are so thankful to have a god amen like you there's so many gods people who worship some kinds of gods but we are glad that we worship the god who created us the one who was before there was anything but yet you existed you are our existing our existence and we are so glad this morning further to be among these people whom we will live together with for eternity and father we are looking forward to the next thing on the supernatural event events and the as we see time is no more further as we see the world every day changes from one thing to another and further earthquakes everywhere father the world is old and the world has come to the end help those who can see it lord that the world has come to the end according to the scriptures and the prophets and the lord jesus himself has prophesied of this time and we see father that time is first spent and we are just we have just arrived and further there's no more kilometers i see as our prophet has said let us now go up past the curtain of time and we are so glad bless every brother and sister the word we are about to partake it to partake take off we ask you to bless in jesus christ's name amen and you may be seated have we read the scripture no no you may you may read them when the lord maybe we should use a soate instead of english i i don't know i will use i will read in english but the letters get issued god bless you for reading and god bless you for reading [Music] foreign then let's turn to hebrews chapter four five [Music] m [Music] okay [Music] me [Music] god will help us you know when things were going and getting tough for us the believers god helped us we managed to preach up to kali california and some places through the youtube and we are receiving from a response from these places the people uh thanking the lord for receiving the weight during the those lockdowns and look ups [Music] when the lord jesus left and then he said i shall not leave you alone miranda youtube and the supernatural we have the seventh season uh you know i think yesterday we we we did the read of script from the spoken word so there's so many people who do not even bother to read the spoken word [Music] spoken word but there's a reason why fellas [Music] then she came back but they're still sick i was with babies then i said to the sister you know you are sick because you are still in that other side of the of the sea or you are on the other side of jordan amen that's why you are in the name of the lord jesus christ of christ and the next thing she came to my house is another sister from the same place with the testimony that i told her that she should now cross over even god said to moses you've been remaining in this place [Music] that's why now they have started to protest [Music] they were remaining in the place where there was a disease they are still in the the time because once you take it a step forward you are you are leaving behind the old things and they got healed before that was their faith even illiterate and the one of them some of them they because always there's always one who start the thing while looking at the shadow of paul peterson here but she picked up something if i can touch because there was a revelation [Applause] what are you for me [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah imagine you must look at the sign of is yes sir please do it [Applause] there's no way you can go come to god and live without something i it will like a healing campaign but i will say campaign you know once she realized she received that revelation that for her to touch the helm even failed to stop so because they were told that jesus is inside [Music] jesus jesus [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i said don't go back you'll find one child you'll find a child and this happens she got she conceived me what they did then the people inside would wonder revelation was pushing them come around hashes usually openly it's so hard and then when they look down like that they realized [Music] down to who we are which is you can fight him anywhere you can find a way okay jesus hebrews a promise being left as of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it how do we find him amen a person [Music] could see the believers [Music] but because it was used by moses the bible calls it the road of muslims [Applause] is [Music] today you take a photo the people would be after you and not vote over jesus christ what do you have in your mind god made use of the thing that the people rejected and with that road [Music] because they were upfront [Music] the people who could see that they they could even say hey pharaoh is knowing the message [Music] all right now i'm trying to come through these stages quickly but [Music] now [Applause] they came out of the sea on the other side they looked back because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hated to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me foreign [Music] foreign why why i'm saying this breaking from holding people and i see lying here because somebody not not one person they always come to me with my ability to sing the bible says we should not say father to any man that's how the people read the bible without the spirits [Music] horses but let me cut it short okay paul says i am your father hold on hold on i will join you saying that to the children all right amen now wilderness those who crossed the red sea teaching the world should you say to one of them give us a testimony refer you back he will say i we were i was in egypt the very same people born they died for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them for we who have believed to enter into yes but the word was even spoken before they will let you open so others entered in his rest you see the bible says they died in the wilderness the wilderness is the type of the second pool you have stages second is the wilderness for you to continue working on um here's this main thing here for few minutes starting with saying the mystery of the bride yes [Music] can you see this the mystery of the bride see perissa the rapture i come i'm coming here it's the rupture of the supernatural bride [Music] amen okay the invisible union amen the invisible union of the bride yeah that is page they are giving you the page then yesterday we look at look from the place because for few minutes we are going into this so this will help us abraham when abraham said to god abram after that that lord was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place listen now after after you know they've been together but they came a time when they separate now after they separate [Music] separation [Music] amen amen [Music] [Applause] but then god can't speak to [Applause] that is genesis chapter 1 only this bible of mine the the the pages are so thin you never believe it listen where are we rest for jesus 14 do i have verse 14 here nah and the lord said unto abraham and after lord has separated from him lift up now dying from that place amen amen you can't see them from there you can't see them from there but come up here and i will show you me but [Music] i'm talking to the children of abraham was it 47 i think let me try 45 for 25 45 and he brought forth a sign one his god is god's sign that's why you see our sign here is the pyramid [Music] in every thing almost because that was the sign given to inaudible [Music] with this what they called the overcomers who have passed on out [Music] names and you find those who came halfway the overcomers are these who finished the course but when you get over finishing from the seventh church then you will see next week will bring them because it is the army that is going to fight it together with others as they are here [Applause] [Music] amen but you still have to be raptured now after you are raptured you become part of that together with the overcomers from each church [Applause] is yes please why um [Music] [Music] see huh his hiding place he was also given three and a half years so you have the three and a half years of christ yeah [Music] [Music] it shows us and he tells us that what god is telling us also they do quote the same scripture although they can't bring it if we're responsible for the death 16 we will bring it you'll see the king kings of the east are moving recitation recipes they are reporting about the drying up of them we don't preach youtube that's right but we will but the interpreter of these things is the seventh angel amen is look because [Music] that's [Music] [Music] that's where they thought they would come and find the pharisees the priests the thing is as they followed the stars and when they arrive in jerusalem jerusalem the star did not support them really he asked for ever support so they went in the city now where is he [Music] about it is because right now the prophet ended up being in the pyramid of angels we won't finish defeat now it says who unto the inhabitants the word who are they come on um each and every even the water will burn with fire limits revelation chapter 21 says in one area and i've seen new heaven in your head the sea will also bend with fire [Music] is the beast will come see what are you really [Music] is you [Music] [Music] all those who have fallen from heaven we'll check it the lord if god will be with us [Music] now we find here that enoch was the seventh from nowhere yesterday i said from noah because here it is noah is just it was just a slip off of the pen then it says now i was hearing six men before him died before no or before enoch died enough enoch was translated you know god is the seventh church age that takes the rapture now he was therefore now watch on the seventh step yeah have you been introduced [Music] [Music] first [Music] he came again [Music] who is this king who is this miracle now who is he no man he was in he was god he became jesus i'm a jesus he came here as a prophet amen amen hello baby jesus coming like that jesus dinner give me [Music] [Music] [Applause] his god was god jesus [Music] but when he came to the jews and said who is this god now who is this [Music] [Music] amen amen then he says he who sees me that's why it confused peter as well yes peter says lord maureen today we want you to be clear overstreet show as the father because every day he would repeat it he was seeing me my father amen imagine maybe philippe was drinking coffee but you can you can imagine that that day philippe they show us the fact that when cheaper as if he was making matters worse he says to philippe [Music] don't you know that my father is in me amen and that's where he took the book from [Music] we've been together all these times but you don't know who we are [Applause] you haven't seen the message you haven't seen the message if it was like that i would ask such a question philippe because we are losing ground reaction and we are closing let me run this man we stand up phillip philippe all right then i'm in trouble for me so okay god called the men elijah elisha because it types christ in the church elijah [Music] m i mean elijah how was earlier went with a similarly elise now here it says it represents christ in his church because you can't follow the lord from 1922 is to take you back to where you are because those who were with him before the foundation or of the world um you can't lose them who is going to worship this mighty god [Music] those who will worship this mighty god can i finish it by before all right light amen and i'll i'll take it from here since elijah is following you i wanna tell you i like you believes hemorrhage and your soul soon i shall not leave you whatever no he was an inward believer my same position in your language what is possession no position possession you don't know the gospel today is mixed up because of profession when you talk about him he's singing that is profession but you know he comes in to you and pointed himself out [Music] [Music] when john opened his mouth and said behold the lamb of god and the sons of the prophet verse five chapter two of second kings the sons of the prophets the lord will take away the master from thy master from thy head today okay because i mean the next step was a jordan hold and then and the fifth men of the sons of the prophets went out and stood and to view where from afar but they too fella live on now now the prophet said it really represents christ and his church christ [Music] as you see now the two has gone beyond the cutting of time [Music] you you have what you call a theophany analysis if your theophany can meet melchizedek no human being will see that you can say he fell away something in me [Applause] and no man can see that and even say but when fell away you can see that brother is a man like me [Applause] [Music] now if somebody would ask them are you also the [Music] they would [Music] [Music] if you read in the bible uh the church order or reject those things she rejected the end-time message [Applause] because the bride of christ christ should stick to the world he would do that to the church they should follow that this particular chip are not telling amen amen if they stop following the word they are in the message physically [Applause] he takes every weight from the prophet [Music] [Music] he doesn't inject himself with or of his own ideas he should be like a like a now these 50 men sons of the prophets you are far off and they too stood by the church and elijah took his men [Music] what is [Music] that's why he saw the helm of his garments so he acted me she acted and his actions were unique [Music] [Music] would you more ill and that is but elisha said if god is god and that is like jesus prophet to take whatever my elijah can you make me the mental yeah now then our man's a man um [Music] [Music] [Applause] and funny respect amen here is the sons of god if you are a son and daughter amen problems with amen the water is never born um and elijah took his mental illness [Music] [Music] i'm a [Music] because it worships also it respects he says no no this one's open for them they are like those ones it can see them you know when i was there heavy guillermo somebody a white young man like when he arrived there oh subway kid now we can see the uh [Applause] who is approaching nazi as we were coming jerusalem [Applause] [Music] i saw the new union [Music] they are now on this on that other side but the language is asked what i tell him to do is [Music] when then it shall happen [Music] that was not yet the fullness of the fullness of my spirituality when they still went on heaven trying to appeal it was he said you have asked a a hack thing you understand the hard thing is because you've got to take me off your head because you are depending on me if there is something you would say prophet [Music] as they still went on [Music] [Music] we appreciate [Applause] will be wiped is is [Music] [Music] see
