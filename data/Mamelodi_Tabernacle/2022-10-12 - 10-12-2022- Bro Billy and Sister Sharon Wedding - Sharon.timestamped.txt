[1:32:37] so
[1:32:40] when Jesus was asked for many years
[1:32:44] I'll quickly turn also to the book of
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:59] quickly I'll find this scripture here
[1:33:07] chapter 3 verse 3 chapter 19 yeah
[1:33:11] three the Pharisees also came unto him
[1:33:15] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[1:33:18] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:33:21] for every cause
[1:33:23] foreign
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:39] which made them at the beginning made
[1:33:42] them male and female
[1:33:54] that's the scripture that we have just
[1:33:56] read uh
[1:33:59] he made them men
[1:34:03] he he called their name Adam
[1:34:10] verse 5 and said for this causal a man
[1:34:13] live father and mother and shall cleft
[1:34:16] to his wife and they twin shall be one
[1:34:20] flesh
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:33] now uh listen to it carefully
[1:34:37] for this course shall a man live father
[1:34:40] and mother
[1:34:41] foreign
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:11] foreign it was not in God's plan for us
[1:35:16] to be born of men and women
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:24] original system of God we were created
[1:35:28] in that system of God
[1:35:37] death Beth was introduced later
[1:35:46] then the Lord said to the woman
[1:35:49] from today Thou shalt bring children in
[1:35:52] this manner
[1:35:57] but it was not so
[1:36:02] much Man was created not born
[1:36:05] um
[1:36:08] that's why if you come through birth and
[1:36:11] the Bible says You must be born again
[1:36:20] that's why we all are supposed to be
[1:36:23] born again
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:29] because of the best a child coming
[1:36:32] through birth was the premi that was not
[1:36:35] the original plan of God
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:44] it was just a permissive will I
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] am
[1:36:53] okay now we are looking at this that's
[1:36:57] why it says
[1:36:58] men shall leave his
[1:37:01] father and mother
[1:37:08] as as a restoration
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] because when he got married
[1:37:18] he had no father and mother
[1:37:25] but it is sin that caused all that
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:30] money all right now before yeah
[1:37:36] men shall live father and mother
[1:37:40] um
[1:37:45] to his wife
[1:37:51] he didn't say his girlfriend
[1:37:57] but to his wife because originally
[1:38:01] that's how they were made
[1:38:06] the same scripture
[1:38:13] God created
[1:38:16] amen amen male and female
[1:38:21] created he them
[1:38:28] okay amen
[1:38:30] now uh Savannah
[1:38:33] we are going to read this masterpiece
[1:38:36] that has closed all this uh
[1:38:40] marital problems
[1:38:52] did you know that in Christ there is no
[1:38:55] diverse
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:02] do you know that um
[1:39:04] it is not from God I see
[1:39:08] now from God
[1:39:11] he made them
[1:39:13] men and female
[1:39:19] that is
[1:39:23] now before a man can marry
[1:39:30] as we were taught even by the prophet of
[1:39:33] God the seventh angel messenger
[1:39:40] so you don't go around looking for one
[1:39:43] but you go straight to God and they pray
[1:39:47] to God for your wife that is already
[1:39:50] there amenities
[1:40:06] by predestination when you were born you
[1:40:10] your wife was also born somewhere else
[1:40:13] foreign
[1:40:42] they will come along in your heart
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] foreign
[1:41:23] the Bible says the elders in the house
[1:41:38] don't marry until you you meet eliasa
[1:41:51] wait for aliyaza Festival
[1:41:56] now this is
[1:42:02] said to him
[1:42:04] go and find a wife for my son he is
[1:42:14] he never said go go and find a
[1:42:16] girlfriend for my son
[1:42:23] but a wife
[1:42:26] for my son
[1:42:35] started and the Bible says he was the
[1:42:38] eldest in the house of Abraham
[1:42:42] Aries
[1:42:51] just like a
[1:42:54] God when
[1:42:56] he he's he sent his Elder the
[1:43:01] the seventh angel messenger is an elder
[1:43:04] in the house
[1:43:15] even for the bride of Christ
[1:43:19] to be called
[1:43:21] God has sent the elders in the house
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:31] so I said behold I will send you Elijah
[1:43:34] the prophet
[1:43:38] shall turn their hearts of the father
[1:43:41] children back to their fathers yes
[1:43:46] because if then it is back to the
[1:43:49] fathers then you are in order
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:58] and the wine because it has to come
[1:44:01] through the bloodline
[1:44:08] um
[1:44:13] he never said
[1:44:16] the the woman you are going to find for
[1:44:19] my son
[1:44:22] um
[1:44:27] would be like this or this or that um
[1:44:36] because the real person there was God
[1:44:40] himself
[1:44:47] and guys why this messenger
[1:44:51] uh when he arrived
[1:44:55] where it was at the well a finale but
[1:44:59] you see amen where women came for to
[1:45:03] collect water uh
[1:45:07] he never looked
[1:45:11] he prayed to God
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:15] and said to let it be a woman of this
[1:45:19] nature
[1:45:24] is in this amen amen and that woman
[1:45:28] started to act according to the prayer
[1:45:37] gave him water and said I will also give
[1:45:41] the camels our numbers
[1:45:47] that was the prayer of alias
[1:45:53] let
[1:45:54] her be the one
[1:45:57] who give me water and also the camels
[1:46:11] all right it was predestinated
[1:46:33] God can match things up
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:41] he matched you with your wife
[1:46:48] man man that the appointed time you
[1:46:54] are you will find your wife
[1:46:59] he was there already
[1:47:04] prepared before the foundation of the
[1:47:06] world
[1:47:12] one scripture here
[1:47:15] I won't be long here
[1:47:18] you know today we have things like
[1:47:22] marriage divorce marriage divorce
[1:47:25] foreign
[1:47:42] you go to a garage
[1:47:45] one garage is selling cars
[1:47:50] new new cars and so forth
[1:47:59] and if you go through and
[1:48:02] pass by a scrap yard
[1:48:04] um
[1:48:09] you know that that that cow of the Year
[1:48:12] so-called in the in that garage is
[1:48:14] coming to this scrapyard
[1:48:25] amen
[1:48:27] that's why some people in the world when
[1:48:30] they marry
[1:48:31] foreign
[1:48:39] you know
[1:48:43] they no they are not sure that they will
[1:48:46] go together up to the end so so
[1:48:53] you know it is like that without Christ
[1:48:59] while the people are preparing for a
[1:49:01] marriage
[1:49:07] of the same marriage
[1:49:10] they are also preparing for the end of
[1:49:13] the same marriage
[1:49:22] it's like that in the world today
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] okay but not in Christ
[1:49:32] in Christ once married
[1:49:35] always
[1:49:37] eternally married
[1:49:45] Christ now so
[1:49:47] much he says have you not read that he
[1:49:52] which made them at the beginning made
[1:49:55] them male and female
[1:50:03] because he didn't want the mail to be
[1:50:06] going around looking for the females uh
[1:50:14] and he said for this question a man live
[1:50:17] father and mother and they shall Cliff
[1:50:20] to his wife they turn shall be one flesh
[1:50:36] now
[1:50:38] um
[1:50:39] let me ask this question
[1:50:42] if the two are one
[1:50:46] can one divorce itself
[1:50:50] foreign
[1:51:18] now my question is can one divorce
[1:51:21] itself
[1:51:24] foreign
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:57] foreign
[1:52:30] that's all we can lose
[1:52:34] you're all right that's why in Christ
[1:52:37] says now wherefore they are no more time
[1:52:43] but one flesh you add it to be remorse
[1:52:47] what they forgot hath joined together
[1:52:55] let no men
[1:53:00] put us under
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:06] even if you can promise me Millions
[1:53:14] I will never be a minister that will his
[1:53:18] job will be to separate men and women
[1:53:28] [Applause]
[1:53:30] but another thing
[1:53:33] no one can separate men and women that
[1:53:37] are predestinated
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:47] because the Bible says what God has done
[1:53:50] shall stand forever and ever and ever
[1:53:52] remember
[1:53:59] if there's a separation then there was a
[1:54:02] separation
[1:54:06] [Applause]
[1:54:09] maybe you didn't hear it
[1:54:11] maybe you didn't hear
[1:54:13] um
[1:54:15] if
[1:54:16] the there is a separation
[1:54:20] that means
[1:54:22] there was a separation
[1:54:27] because what God has done shall stand
[1:54:30] forever the Bible says so forever
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:39] if it's separated then it's separated
[1:54:43] okay
[1:54:46] [Applause]
[1:54:49] now let's just look at the last thing
[1:54:52] here
[1:54:54] the first Covenant
[1:54:59] was one man one woman
[1:55:07] you know even
[1:55:08] polygamy
[1:55:10] um
[1:55:13] when Jesus arrived
[1:55:16] because Moses allowed them for polygamy
[1:55:24] and the Lord the Lord Jesus says yes it
[1:55:28] was because of the hardness
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:37] you know there was always a long queue
[1:55:40] there at the Moses office
[1:55:48] you know couples coming in
[1:55:52] one accusing the other cars
[1:56:00] and the Moses would end up allowing them
[1:56:04] foreign
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:49] actually
[1:56:51] uh
[1:56:52] you know that the name
[1:56:56] if it's not here
[1:56:58] originally uh
[1:57:03] it is Adam who called her if
[1:57:06] [Music]
[1:57:10] that's what God called her
[1:57:15] yes
[1:57:18] they are named not her name their name
[1:57:21] was called
[1:57:25] foreign that's the name that's why
[1:57:28] they are going to be called
[1:57:34] what is their name now
[1:57:35] [Music]
[1:57:38] the name will be
[1:57:41] coaching guide
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:48] that is
[1:57:51] but after the fall
[1:57:57] one became
[1:57:59] amen
[1:58:02] after the fall
[1:58:04] they come with different names
[1:58:11] the Covenant was broken but
[1:58:19] they come under one name
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:31] Adam
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:37] where the name if came from not from God
[1:58:39] Jesus
[1:58:43] God called them Adam
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:46] but after after the fall
[1:58:50] the same if you read Genesis chapter 3
[1:58:55] verse 20.
[1:59:00] tells you this uh for many people now
[1:59:04] this is the restoration of things here
[1:59:09] and Adam called his wife's name if Adam
[1:59:19] occurred Adam
[1:59:24] let's say it God called her Adam
[1:59:33] or rather he called them Adam
[1:59:42] yes
[1:59:44] Adam changed the name of this wife and
[1:59:49] said from today you are if
[1:59:56] um
[1:59:59] if he was not her original name yeah
[2:00:05] her original name is Adam
[2:00:10] but after she was offered a fruit from
[2:00:15] the tree
[2:00:21] when Adam looked at her
[2:00:24] um
[2:00:26] and then he said that is verse 20 and
[2:00:30] Adam
[2:00:31] called his wife's name if
[2:00:39] Adam not God
[2:00:41] Adam
[2:00:43] amen amen because she was the mother of
[2:00:48] all living
[2:00:54] she was the mother of
[2:00:58] the firstborn
[2:00:59] you are kind and able yeah
[2:01:08] that caused a change
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:11] from today you are if
[2:01:14] we have the mother of all
[2:01:20] whether it's Cain or raise able
[2:01:29] when the church is is
[2:01:33] reconciled
[2:01:35] why we make
[2:01:37] it is called Christ
[2:01:42] that is his church
[2:01:44] and formerly his church
[2:01:48] he said it shall be called by his name
[2:01:54] the Lord Jesus Christ is the name
[2:01:57] foreign
[2:02:08] Jesus the Lord God in Jerusalem that is
[2:02:12] not the name of the church
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:23] and his bride
[2:02:26] their name is Christ uh
[2:02:30] Christ meaning the anointed
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:36] you see so that's why
[2:02:39] the names come after the fall
[2:02:42] um
[2:02:46] the names
[2:02:49] interpreted the separations
[2:02:58] those under this name
[2:03:03] has their own way of
[2:03:06] worshiping
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:09] this also under this name
[2:03:15] they have their own way of worship
[2:03:20] that's what names mean
[2:03:24] names mean separated
[2:03:29] they are not coming under one spiritual
[2:03:32] umbrella
[2:03:37] each and every one of uh this this names
[2:03:43] has her own way of worship
[2:03:47] [Laughter]
[2:03:50] like the film stars
[2:03:57] you know I I I think you understand film
[2:04:01] stars
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:06] when they marry
[2:04:08] they don't change their names
[2:04:13] because they can they can separate any
[2:04:15] they can marry today and separate
[2:04:18] tomorrow
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:44] then the man remains Richard button
[2:04:48] um
[2:04:50] but but they are married
[2:04:53] amen not under the original plan of God
[2:05:01] this wonderful today
[2:05:06] the marriage of the Believers in Christ
[2:05:14] May men shall live his father and and
[2:05:19] you
[2:05:19] mothers
[2:05:25] the restoration of the first Covenant
[2:05:33] because the first under the first
[2:05:36] Covenant
[2:05:39] you've got no father and mother
[2:05:45] God
[2:05:47] Covenant
[2:05:51] by a permissive will of God
[2:05:57] not the original will of God
[2:06:01] the original will of God
[2:06:05] they came under creation
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:12] is that sure uh that's why before you
[2:06:16] can marry
[2:06:18] foreign
[2:06:38] [Music]
[2:06:59] it should be from God
[2:07:02] then it will remain in God
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:08] that's why they had to be born again
[2:07:14] in order uh
[2:07:28] you are restored first
[2:07:32] now let me read maybe the last thing
[2:07:36] here
[2:07:38] you know that was the marriage according
[2:07:41] to the first Covenant
[2:07:45] did you know that um
[2:07:50] if you are not born again
[2:07:54] you can pray and fast and pray
[2:08:00] but it won't help the cause
