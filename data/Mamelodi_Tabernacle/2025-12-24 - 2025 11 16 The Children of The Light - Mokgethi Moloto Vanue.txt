I have f I have fond memories of him during his missionary stay here in Congo. And I believe that the Almighty Lord has seen fit to call his servant home to eternal rest after he had accomplished his work on this earth for many years for the edification of his people. May the Almighty Lord God comfort you and strengthen you in faith and love and help you to keep the moral of faith and walk in the footstep he left in the sand of time.

[singing] [music] [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh greetings to the saints in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Um it is quite a while since we have been this part of the ministry. Uh you know we have been taken care of by our beloved pastor &gt;&gt; pastor is and we were enjoying ourselves. [applause] So as we stand here at the same time we also feel some vacuum and it's quite a big vacuum because the man of God has has served us for many years and he performed with distinction. So um we really appreciate the ministry &gt;&gt; and we really also appreciate the family and we also appreciate you. So without any waste of time, I will ask that we open our Bibles. Uh we read from the book of Genesis chapter 1. We read from verse 1 to verse 5. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 5. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1 from verse 1 to 5. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you pray for us brother? Gracious heavenly father, we want to thank you this morning. Thank you Lord for this beautiful day. You have gathered us, oh God, to this place because this is not a place that was created by us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is your place, oh God. &gt;&gt; It's actually a place you chose to put your name upon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; And now here is your children, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming from different places, oh God, to come to your place and hear you speak, oh God. You have never disappointed us. All the time you come, you descend on the pull pit, there's always something special that you say unto your children. Oh, like you always descended to your places, oh God. And then they would say, did our hearts not burn within us when he was talking unto us, oh God? Outside. sight. Amen. And amen. Amen. You may be seated. Now for our subject this morning, &gt;&gt; I wanted us to talk about the children of the light because uh we come from that position. It's a position of light and um in that from that position you can be able to create like our father was able to create. And so the first thing that he said he said let there be light. Okay, let me read it again just uh so that we can be together. &gt;&gt; It says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth period. Amen. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Now in verse three, that's where it becomes interesting. That's where he says, "And God said, Let there be light. And there was light. &gt;&gt; And we all know that that light it's is not the light of the sun. &gt;&gt; It's the supernatural light. M and if you continue, it says, "And God saw the light that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness." The first thing that he said, "Let there be light." He never said anything about darkness. He just said, &gt;&gt; "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural thing. &gt;&gt; But remember where we have read. It says the earth was void and without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. So if you look at it spiritually, God &gt;&gt; had seeds lying dominant somewhere. So he was working towards those seats. Now to get to the seat, &gt;&gt; you must first create an atmosphere that is supernatural because you are going to the supernatural people. Let me put it this way the perfect will of God. We are not supposed to come through sex. We were supposed to be called and we come from the dust of the earth. We were not supposed to be born. That is the perfect will. But he gave us the permissive one where we bypassed our theophonies. And we come through birth. And when you come through birth, it says you were born in sin shaped in iniquity. So you come short of the grace of God. So God knew that he's working towards something. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let me put it this way again. You see when we talk about the seals maybe let me read something in in in Genesis. I mean in in Revelation &gt;&gt; uh Revelation chapter 6 &gt;&gt; 6 it says &gt;&gt; verse one more verse one &gt;&gt; and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it were a noise of thunder One of the four is saying come and see. Now what I want to bring to you is that when the seals were opened, the first cannot be opened without the seventh because the seventh carries all the other sins. That is why there was the seventh man. the seventh star who had to come and interpret the whole thing. They were there but they were sealed. But there was a man who God chose so that he can open the whole thing. That is why when you read it, it says when he opened one of the seals, are we together now? I'm back to Genesis. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let let there be light." It was a supernatural thing that needed to open the whole thing without the supernatural. You can't understand the word of God. You can't even when you try to imagine your mind is so limited to the capacity that God has. God is so big. God is so vast that to understand him you must first start there. Then when you start from that position the supernatural position of light then you'll be able to understand that you are a child of the light. Um, in other words, &gt;&gt; we need to come to the realization that &gt;&gt; we were sometimes darkness. The book of Ephesians says so. It says you were sometimes &gt;&gt; darkness. That is why he started by light. Maybe let me just read it quickly. &gt;&gt; Um Ephesians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from verse um 8. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. It says, "For you were sometimes darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light." That is why where we read in Genesis, it says it was void and without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep. but the spirit of God was moving around because it knew that it's got an attraction power. That attraction power can transform death can transform sleep can transform death into life. That's what Ephesians says. &gt;&gt; Just in being the carpet. I'll just skip to verse 14 in Ephesians. &gt;&gt; That is why it says, "Wherefore he said, &gt;&gt; awake thou that sleepst and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light. See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools. But as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil. Who can say you are living in days that are not evil? The days are surely evil. The days that we're living in does not require your power. The days that we're living in requires the supernatural light to operate within your life. That supernatural light is able to change your nature to that of Christ because he is that light. &gt;&gt; Amen. He once came to Paul in a form of a light and Paul was persecuting the saints. But when he met that light, it was a blinding light. It strike him blind until he couldn't see where he was going. He recognized that this must be Christ and they gave him directions where he must go because God works in a man. That's the most dangerous place because man when he looks in another man. What can you tell me this one? But if God is in that man and is God speaking, you better be careful. I have taught there's one thing that I have learned in life actually I'm taught by the prophet &gt;&gt; and the pastor they say if you can't respect a man respect the office if you can't respect the respect the office because that office is anointed. &gt;&gt; So we we are following and this light this light has got the resurrection power. It can even when you are dead not asleep but dead that light has got the power to give you life. &gt;&gt; That's what we are talking about. Now I want us to bring it a little bit closer because even nature &gt;&gt; um types the spiritual &gt;&gt; and you know um where we are reading in Genesis &gt;&gt; um we're actually reading about how the heaven and the earth were created. Are we together? And I like the way it puts it. It says in the beginning um God &gt;&gt; created the Now this is not the beginning of God. &gt;&gt; It's another beginning. It's the beginning of the creation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that is why it says in the beginning because the beginning of creation and it says he created the heaven and the earth. Now it starts with the heavens first and then it comes with the earth. &gt;&gt; That is why I say I like it. And you know why I like it is because it affirms me that I did not start here. I started from heaven before I came here. This is just a battleground. We call it round number two. Round number one. We chucked him out. and we came here. We are after him. [applause] That is why he operates from under because we are still here. &gt;&gt; All right. Um I was saying &gt;&gt; the natural &gt;&gt; types the super Now, after God had done these things, h maybe let's not rush it a bit. Let's let's let's let's do this. &gt;&gt; Let me take this spoken word. &gt;&gt; Or maybe before I take that spoken word, let me do this. Amen. I will say um we we we just saw now here &gt;&gt; the beginning of creation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So and then that beginning we are narrated the story. No no we are we are narrated &gt;&gt; by Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses uh was a blessed man because God spoke to him face to face and God could show him how the the thing started. Are we together? Uh so meaning God was able to transform Moses &gt;&gt; and take him back to the beginning and take Moses actually back to his mind and we'll read how he did that. Let me read another scripture because we are talking about the beginning of creation. It's a civilization. &gt;&gt; Let me read this. First John first John &gt;&gt; 1 John chapter one &gt;&gt; first John chapter one. Now I'm going to read as follows. It says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with ourselves which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us. That which we have seen and we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father. and with his son Jesus Christ. Now the important thing here that I want to see is about that eternal life which was with the father. So it's another civilization. We read about the civilization of the beginning of creation. &gt;&gt; Now we visit first John. It tells it tells us &gt;&gt; that for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life. If if you for you to see eternal life, how? Because you dwell in time. Are we together? So, um there's no other way that you can be able to attest of eternal life unless you came before the dispensation of time. Before there was time, you were there of the word of life which we have handled which we have seen. We are talking eternal things here. For you to see eternal things, you must have been in another body before. The body of the word. You must have been in your theophile. It's just that you bypassed it and you dropped into time. But before you dropped here, you were there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you are able to attest There was another dispensation before the starting of the creation of the earth. There was another dispensation. There was another civilization and I was there. Then I can attest of the eternal life which was with the father. Pastor taught us very well. Make no mistake. He has made us to be grounded to take our positions and take the foot forward. We are not fighting flesh and blood but spiritualities in higher places. Don't allow those spirits to dwell you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; So now I just wanted to just to demonstrate you know that there is this side and this side and the pro the prophet speaks about it. Let me see if I'll find what I want to read here. &gt;&gt; Uh the spoken word &gt;&gt; uyalty of sin and the penalty. &gt;&gt; The cruelty of sin and the penalty. &gt;&gt; H I'm going to read paragraph 39 paragraph 39. Um, so that Oh, yeah. We no longer have a watch there. Sorry. What time did I start? I just want Okay. Let let me use mine here. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So let me take um this spoken word the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost &gt;&gt; paragraph 39. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 39 &gt;&gt; it read as follows. &gt;&gt; It says now I want to draw just a small picture to you talking now. Let's all of us take a little trip. tonight on a little ship. It's a ship of Zion, a little spaceship or a ship. Let's go back a 100 million years before there was a world. Before there even was a star or anything and there you can see nothing but space. &gt;&gt; And all that space was God. That is why when people want to release something new, you know the marketers When they want to release something in you, they just say, "Watch the space." Watch the space. They keep you there. They know that they're creating anxiety. What is this space? What is after this space? Then you must keep watching this. Now the prophet says, you know, before there was even a star, Before there was a world, he want to take us. Let's travel with him. You know, uh because he was the seventh man. He knew things. He saw things. He visited dimensions and come and narate to us what happens. Now here &gt;&gt; he's mainly showing us that &gt;&gt; we come af you you need a a a spaceship spaceship. &gt;&gt; You know those rockets that they shoot And as they travel, they lift something is because the power of that thing is done. So they they drop the weight, engage the second power and continue. When that power is ended, drop it. Continue. you know. Um, okay, let me let me read maybe so that we &gt;&gt; now it says &gt;&gt; in paragraph 40 paragraph 40, &gt;&gt; and now we'll watch coming into existence a little white light. We'll call it like a hallow. And that was the son of God, &gt;&gt; the logos &gt;&gt; that went out of God in the beginning and then that how he was standing there in his mind he begin to think. of what the [snorts] world would be &gt;&gt; and drew all this picture in his mind and he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And um remember we talked about the spiritual light. But now we are coming to a point where we want to see the natural side of it. Because the greatest light that you can find naturally speaking is the sun. &gt;&gt; Naturally speaking, the greatest light you need is the sun. &gt;&gt; And if you look at nature, &gt;&gt; you will see that it's attracted to the sun. Are we together? Look at life. Just a little light that can spark there. You see something springing up in the midst of a tarot. something just springs up because there's a crack there &gt;&gt; and the sun is coming it attracts. &gt;&gt; So now um maybe just to show you a little bit I've just shared with harvest that solar system I just want to say something regarding that then I get back to this There we are. That is our solar. &gt;&gt; And you can see there it's the sun. &gt;&gt; So everything the planets the stars they revolve around the sun. Now uh if you count from the sun you can see Mercury Mercury Venus &gt;&gt; then comes us there and then mass &gt;&gt; and so on. &gt;&gt; But if you look I can say to you or allow me to say do you allow me? Now allow me to say there's no foundation. &gt;&gt; It's hanging in space. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But there is something that keeps it. Each one of each one of them is got a line, an axis. exist where it rotates and all of them they rotate around the sun. So apparently it takes 24 hours for the earth to rotate. That is why we've got day and night. It depends on what position of the sun to the earth. That's what brings day and This system &gt;&gt; has never failed. &gt;&gt; Not even one day. There was only one man that said, "Son, stop. He stopped the solar system." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was in battle &gt;&gt; and he needed more time. Then he could stop time proving that &gt;&gt; is from eternity &gt;&gt; to eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the foundation foundation &gt;&gt; is that line. In other words, the foundation &gt;&gt; foundation &gt;&gt; is the sun. &gt;&gt; The sun has got the attraction power. is keeping all these planets attracted to it and therefore they keep their positions. We also have the S but we we rotate around. He makes us keep our position. I cannot fight for another position. I have mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't struggle. &gt;&gt; You know, if God gives you a position, you don't struggle. You know your position because you were placed there by the S. It's only the S &gt;&gt; that can remove you. No one else. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that that that's that's the foundation that keeps us focused. Now I'm going to go again continue with my quotation. Um, I think I stopped in 41 if I'm right. 42. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to 42. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it says because he had this thing in his &gt;&gt; mind &gt;&gt; mind the picture that we saw there was in his mind. He's so organized. When he does something, it's perfect. It does not need a mechanic. &gt;&gt; Mechanic. &gt;&gt; Okay. And an atom split and begin to break forward and atomic went off. the first atomic explosion &gt;&gt; and them atoms begin to accumulate till it made into a cinderike. As the moisture ever what it was begin to break and the atom speed And after a while, there came a star or a piece of a missile that flew off and went through sailing through the air. He watched it maybe for a million years and then and then stopped it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had no hurry. &gt;&gt; He had no hurry. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had plenty of time forever. &gt;&gt; He was from the beginning to the end. There was no time with him. And then another one flies off and it stopped over this way. Are we together? &gt;&gt; All was in the mind of God. So you know this theory of the big bang is not far from the truth. Are we together? The prophet puts it like that as well that everything started to explode and he kept each one to its position until it became a perfect solar system. And when God wherever he is, &gt;&gt; he looks at the earth, he sees a tiny dot. You can just go. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; remember that &gt;&gt; he created this place &gt;&gt; for us that we can continue to show the victory that we had with him back in heaven. If you were victorious there, then you're going to become a victim. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; nothing will touch you. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me go slightly faster. &gt;&gt; I want to go to maybe let me skip some of these things. Okay, no, I think I'm where I want to be now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? &gt;&gt; He is writing the first Bible, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; The first Bible is in the &gt;&gt; zodiac. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The first Bible. &gt;&gt; It was written by who? The first Bible was ever written was written in the skies, the zodiac. &gt;&gt; It starts out with a vision. That's how he comes first and it ends up with Leo the lion. That's also how he comes again to bring judgment to this end. But God when he created or when he wrote his first Bible, &gt;&gt; he knew that It will be so perfect. Only the pure in heart will be able to look and read the signs written in the sky and come back and interpret to us what is happening in our time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, let me put it this way again because we have the zodiac zodiac when when when there was time because remember man fell and after man fell it was in the interest of God to restore man back to his rightful position. Now to do that, God himself, he will have specific people. &gt;&gt; And I'll give you an example, the three men from the east. Those men, they were men that were able to look in the sky and that was their job. They took this thing so serious because their job was to study the stars. The prophet says they don't go in large groups. No, it's three three because three is the number of perfection. And then if many you'll hear the interpretation some interpretations will lead you astray. &gt;&gt; You must get the interpretation from God. not man-made man-made interpretations. They they cause confusion. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God's perfect. So the mages &gt;&gt; because they were studying and then they saw this star &gt;&gt; and they interpreted by &gt;&gt; they said you see this one a king &gt;&gt; is born and this star was not static. It was moving. &gt;&gt; It was a living inter it was a flying interpretation. They had to follow it. And as they followed it, you know, they came to a place where because they were going around and saying where is he? Where is he? And people were saying who born king and I think it was Herod. He said, "What are but there's a king bon and he thought he my kingdom is in danger." But he was a smart man. He said to them because he first called others to to to check where is this where is this going to happen according to the scriptures. And then they told him then and then he said okay then he called this man in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; But when you find him just give me weight that I also may go and worship meaning that to kill him. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um but because God is God at that time the star had disappeared because it it knows the right time to appear and disappear to appear and disappear. So it appeared again after they got the message then they went to the place but the word came to them that men when you are done here you don't go the same way go the other route and also it went to the parents that were responsible to say run to Egypt &gt;&gt; because the the the dragon &gt;&gt; is after and then after they've done everything led by the Bible from heaven they went back home and you know after worshiping him and giving him the appropriate gift Now the perfection of God did not end only there &gt;&gt; in the zodiac. No, there was a second Bible. Only the children of the light are able to follow the writing on the wall. Only the children of the life are able to read in their time what God is doing. It's very important to understand in your time what is God doing? So, so I won't read it now but where we're reading it tells you that now The second one &gt;&gt; was the pyramid pyramid. &gt;&gt; Now you must know if something is the word of God, it's mysterious and then everyone else would want to go and venture there. Yeah. That is why even there are magazines that you buy and then when you when you open the try and interpret the zodiac zodiac zodiac has got the stars according to the cluster as we read vision you name them but they if if if you are not predestinated. You'll buy that magazine and then they will interpret you say when were you born but you are a VGO but this month you're going to have a lot of money just look around. It's people trying to venture into something that God has created to talk to his beloved &gt;&gt; and they twist it and make it something else. Now if you go to the pyramid also in the pyramid it was the second Bible. Now the second Bible it requires Did you see that picture of the solar system? &gt;&gt; To build a pyramid, &gt;&gt; you must master the measurements from the sun to the earth. That is why we have Enoch who was the seventh. Always the seventh man types the seventh star. We fall under the seventh star. So you must in other words to do that you must be a master of measurement. You can't use a tape to measure those things. Enoch builded the pyramid. He placed it in the center of the earth to such an extent that when the scientists came and looked at it, they even wondered what type of equipment did he use to put brick one big upon another because of their massive weight. And also they realize that it's right in the center of the earth because they say at any given time it does not cast a shadow. It's perfectly placed. It's aligned with the sun. It's getting it's getting 100% power from the sun. &gt;&gt; It has no shadows. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You must be a master of measurements to build a pyramid. &gt;&gt; And the pastor was telling us that in the pyramid there are shafts. One is looking at blades. Are we together? Shafts that are positioned &gt;&gt; to the zodiac. to show that there's an alignment. It's one Bible written by different people, one by God, one by man here, but it correlates. There's a correlation. The the the energy from the sun It's it's always full. &gt;&gt; And then um let me take the last thing here to say to you, &gt;&gt; we come &gt;&gt; at the time &gt;&gt; where now &gt;&gt; it started with the zodiac. He came to the pyramid and the dead it says it's the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's a it's in written form. &gt;&gt; Are we together? This &gt;&gt; and the pyramid &gt;&gt; pyramid &gt;&gt; and the zodiac &gt;&gt; zodiac &gt;&gt; they speak the same language. &gt;&gt; Now when you come to this one Um um again &gt;&gt; we all there there's many people that venture into this one. Are we together? They also call themselves the elect, the chosen, the bride. Are we together? But there is something that makes us to differ. &gt;&gt; Because when you talk about this one, we can all read it. As long as we are able to read, we can all read it. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But the difference &gt;&gt; is the interpretation. Because it says &gt;&gt; the letter killth. &gt;&gt; So this &gt;&gt; actually kills &gt;&gt; for you to live while reading this. &gt;&gt; You need another spirit. In that spirit this thing becomes a living. That is why the prophet and the pastor they talk about you know Junior Jackson's dream um it was the prophet speaks he puts it like this um let me see if I can find something here but if I don't find it I'll just quote Um, okay. No, it's um Okay, let me see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think it's this one. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, maybe let's go to paragraph 43. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 43. &gt;&gt; Let me let me read here first and see. one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, do you have for all three? Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the one. That's the one. Thank you, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm back in my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, look to me &gt;&gt; and then listen a little bit. &gt;&gt; We will read just now. So I I want to say to you that &gt;&gt; h when we come to the interpretation it's something different because God has you know spoke openly &gt;&gt; but only a few &gt;&gt; that are able to grasp the mystery because I can read now it says you remember little bit messenger they went east the second messengers the dubs a little bit larger beach they went east and then I looked they was with me all the That was the first and the second pool. Now the third came from the west sweeping forward with great terrific speed. They picked me up that was coming back east with the mystery of these seven seas. Just like it said in Junior Jackson that the Lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of the pyramid. There was a white stone that was not written on. Yeah. Let me stop there. Now uh the prophet and the pastor they talk about the white stone. Now that white stone needed to be interpreted and there's only one man that had the interpretation of the white stone. Are you with me now? This man, he said he was caught in the pyramid of the angels. Now, I'm just trying to show you that it correlates from the zodiac to the pyramid. Again, in the pyramid, there is a white stone. Today, because this Bible is written, you need something within you which is a white stone. But inside you that white stone must have an interpretation. To get that interpretation you must listen to the tapes. the prophet and the pastor, &gt;&gt; those will give you &gt;&gt; the interpretation &gt;&gt; because otherwise &gt;&gt; if you look, &gt;&gt; you look, you will not see anything. &gt;&gt; You need a man with a spirit. &gt;&gt; A man &gt;&gt; with a spirit. to transfer impart life. &gt;&gt; And once life is imparted and then the Bible says arise the dead. You are no longer now with the dead. You have arrived where Christ is and you are being interpreted because to be honest, the white stone, &gt;&gt; you are that white stone. You didn't understand yourself. Amen. You come to a place where they are interpreting the white stone. Then you step to understand yourself to say who am I? Oh Lord, who am I that I can hear these unspeakable words, the unwritten words? You know Paul says it was unlawful for men to act. But you they are right inside you. &gt;&gt; The correlation the system of God that he has placed to make man perfect. And then now I said to you, you know, you need to understand the time that you live in and the season because if you don't, you're going to have a problem. You know, there was one time I always tell the story I didn't understand when I was still a boy growing in primary the the days of the week. I was just guessing. You know that things you just guess. &gt;&gt; Now, it so happened that because because it's a guess work. &gt;&gt; You're going to lose. &gt;&gt; So one day I was asleep. &gt;&gt; Then h something says to me, "Hey, you are late, man." &gt;&gt; And when I look at the window, &gt;&gt; I can see that the sun is already now. And I thought, And then I I ran to to change quickly. I prepared myself my uniform, took my school back, &gt;&gt; you know. I didn't even eat breakfast that day. I mean, you know, running corner. My friends are there. They're wearing shorts there. You know, home clothes. They say to me, "Why are you going?" I said, "Guys, are you not going to school?" No, today is Saturday. Just there &gt;&gt; I I could see that guesswork it does not help. Guess &gt;&gt; I need to learn this thing. I need to know Monday and I took it upon myself &gt;&gt; so that I know the times and there so that I don't do something wrong at the wrong time. I must always be on time in season in due season. If you understand the times that you live in, then you start to relax. I didn't repeat that mistake again. It happened once. I learned a lesson and then from there on I knew the days of the world. Today is the first day [applause] &gt;&gt; and and being the first day we honor &gt;&gt; the resurrection. That is why we meet on the first day. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, let me leave it here. I was just saying shalom. Shalom. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; There's a song that says, "I have a father." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can lead us with that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. knows my name.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. When &gt;&gt; to Luna Cresto. [applause] by [music] &gt;&gt; to love.
