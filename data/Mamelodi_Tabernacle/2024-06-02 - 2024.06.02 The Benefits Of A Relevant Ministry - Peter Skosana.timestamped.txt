[1:04:29] sufficient and our presence here is also
[1:04:33] sufficient
[1:04:34] Lord we left our homes Lord Almighty to

[1:04:42] all of us Lord Almighty with one
[1:04:45] spirit so to hear from thee and we
[1:04:49] believe Lord Almighty there never was a
[1:04:52] day where we come before thee and not
[1:04:56] here Lord Almighty from eternity amen so
[1:04:59] we pray Lord Almighty that as we have
[1:05:02] read just one uh verse in this Bible

[1:05:13] Father we find satisfaction in your way

[1:05:28] yourself so that Lord Almighty when we
[1:05:30] depart from this place amen we W be
[1:05:34] hearing a man will be hearing you Lord
[1:05:37] through your
[1:05:38] anointing I ano I anoint each and every
[1:05:41] one of us here Lord gracious Lord thank

[1:05:47] calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ amen
[1:05:51] amen okay you may be seated
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:02] yeah we've just read one uh
[1:06:08] verse uh that says uh no
[1:06:16] man has ever seen
[1:06:21] God you've seen
[1:06:23] it uh then it says no man has ever seen
[1:06:29] God at any
[1:06:32] time it's only the
[1:06:38] son it's only the begotten son which is
[1:06:41] in the bosom of the
[1:06:47] Father the Son is declared
[1:06:52] him okay amen right my
[1:06:57] TI will be the
[1:07:00] benefit of the relevant
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:13] Ministry you know what a Ministry
[1:07:17] is you know what is the relevant
[1:07:21] Ministry is
[1:07:25] so now here in the
[1:07:28] Bible there's always
[1:07:34] dispensations and then those dis
[1:07:39] dispensation if you don't follow
[1:07:42] them you miss the
[1:07:45] relevant
[1:07:47] [Applause]
[1:07:49] ministry right in the time that you are
[1:07:51] living
[1:07:53] in there is a
[1:07:57] Ministry and that
[1:08:00] Ministry is the relevant
[1:08:03] one now if you can ignore
[1:08:08] that you'll enjoy the
[1:08:12] Bible but
[1:08:15] missing the strength of the
[1:08:21] relevance because God
[1:08:25] has different
[1:08:30] dispensations I always give an example
[1:08:32] about
[1:08:35] Moses that now when God said to
[1:08:41] Moses uh go to far to
[1:08:44] far and take my children
[1:08:48] out now there was a
[1:08:53] Ministry that he gave
[1:08:58] Moses and each and everyon of
[1:09:03] Moses has to
[1:09:05] do with taking them
[1:09:09] out now that was a relevant Ministry at
[1:09:13] that
[1:09:17] time there was no other Salon that Moses
[1:09:21] could preach
[1:09:25] that could shake the children of
[1:09:29] Israel and Shake
[1:09:31] far apart from that
[1:09:34] one the other one you can
[1:09:38] preach but it will never reach the
[1:09:43] mark and it
[1:09:46] won't let
[1:09:49] Fara release children of
[1:09:52] Israel so so now the relevant
[1:09:58] ministry will benefit
[1:10:02] us that's that's that's what I want us
[1:10:05] to to to share
[1:10:08] about okay I can give you an
[1:10:11] example about the different uh uh uh
[1:10:17] Church
[1:10:22] ages now during the time of of
[1:10:28] Paul that was the only
[1:10:32] Ministry every
[1:10:34] body should align
[1:10:38] with any other
[1:10:42] Ministry wouldn't benefit
[1:10:46] anybody and that's why each and every
[1:10:51] Church
[1:10:54] age was
[1:10:58] connected to the Eternal
[1:11:03] promise because on the first church
[1:11:06] age God
[1:11:08] said I I will
[1:11:11] give to each of the tree of
[1:11:16] life you see now where is the tree of
[1:11:20] life it's in
[1:11:23] eternity so the promise was the Eternal
[1:11:29] one now here God was speaking to the
[1:11:34] Overcomers see those
[1:11:36] Overcomers I will let them
[1:11:39] eat out of the tree of
[1:11:43] life there's no
[1:11:46] Ministry that can make
[1:11:48] you to eat out of the two of
[1:11:53] life during that era
[1:11:56] apart from Ministry of
[1:11:59] Paul now coming to
[1:12:03] irus the
[1:12:05] Overcomers he said they shall not be
[1:12:08] hurt by the second
[1:12:13] death see now if they won't be Hur by
[1:12:18] the second
[1:12:20] death you know what is the second
[1:12:23] test second is the
[1:12:27] Judgment which means they won't be going
[1:12:29] to any
[1:12:31] judgment and those that W go to the
[1:12:35] judgment will be the
[1:12:38] Overcomers during their
[1:12:41] era during their
[1:12:45] dispensation so you miss your
[1:12:49] ministry in your
[1:12:51] dispensation then you go to the judgment
[1:12:55] then you go to the you'll be saved by
[1:12:58] the
[1:13:01] Judgment because you missed the ministry
[1:13:05] of your
[1:13:06] age the ministry of your
[1:13:13] dispensation amen that
[1:13:16] isus now to
[1:13:19] Mar the Overcomers
[1:13:21] there he said he give them a white stone
[1:13:29] that's the one the Pastor said you will
[1:13:32] continue see now each and every Church
[1:13:38] age then after Mar comes
[1:13:42] col he says they will inherit all
[1:13:49] things I will be his God I will be their
[1:13:53] God and they shall be my
[1:13:57] son you
[1:13:59] see
[1:14:01] every
[1:14:04] Ministry has got a
[1:14:07] promise so even the one that we are
[1:14:09] going to
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:11] now the one that I'll be telling you
[1:14:14] about has got a
[1:14:17] promise and
[1:14:19] if you miss your
[1:14:22] promise you miss your inheritance
[1:14:28] because the in each and every
[1:14:31] promise there is your
[1:14:35] inheritance look the thing that makes
[1:14:37] you to come
[1:14:40] here is because you want to inherit
[1:14:45] something now you will
[1:14:48] never inherit it if you don't know your
[1:14:52] promise
[1:14:56] you inherit according to your
[1:15:00] promise you cannot worship
[1:15:02] God not knowing what is your
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:08] inheritance and what is your
[1:15:12] promise in that case you'll be just a
[1:15:14] church
[1:15:18] goer are
[1:15:22] together and then he he went
[1:15:25] on and says to the Overcomers on the
[1:15:30] fifth Church
[1:15:34] age says I'll give
[1:15:37] power over the
[1:15:41] Nations you see now those that will have
[1:15:46] power over all
[1:15:48] nations be in the New
[1:15:52] Jerusalem and All Nations
[1:15:55] will be out of the
[1:15:58] city they will come
[1:16:02] in but those that have
[1:16:05] power the one that are in
[1:16:09] the not that the other ones don't have
[1:16:12] power but the city is the main important
[1:16:17] one you know the prophet
[1:16:19] says he
[1:16:21] says uh
[1:16:25] he will be in a a certain street
[1:16:30] name in the New Jerusalem
[1:16:38] huj he
[1:16:39] himself he said I will
[1:16:43] be in the
[1:16:47] avenue called
[1:16:49] hallelujah
[1:16:51] hallelujah next to the worshiping team
[1:16:55] woring look to those
[1:16:59] angels so when you are
[1:17:03] worshiping you must know your your
[1:17:06] position in
[1:17:10] ET because the prophet claim to be that
[1:17:14] she will be next to
[1:17:16] you and
[1:17:22] hearing are we to to
[1:17:26] so on and on let's go to the sixth
[1:17:29] Church
[1:17:32] age I'll will make a pillar in the
[1:17:35] temple of
[1:17:38] God p in the in the temple of
[1:17:43] God each and every one of
[1:17:46] us who are
[1:17:48] Overcomers we know our
[1:17:53] dispensation now coming to us
[1:17:56] now what is our
[1:17:58] promise he says I will grant
[1:18:02] you is referring to
[1:18:05] us to sit with
[1:18:07] me in my
[1:18:10] Throne you see now is Grant to sit with
[1:18:14] us in his
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:17] throne that's what will
[1:18:21] benefit that is our Rel
[1:18:26] Ministry so now our relevant
[1:18:30] Ministry is the seventh
[1:18:34] SE that's why we given a
[1:18:37] power of the third
[1:18:40] pool are we
[1:18:43] together no now the Bible
[1:18:49] says uh you no no it's not the Bible
[1:18:53] it's a saying
[1:18:56] says you won't go to heaven on a rocking
[1:19:07] chair that is why they
[1:19:10] say
[1:19:12] uh yeah you won't go to heaven on a
[1:19:15] rocking chair that's why they say you
[1:19:16] are an
[1:19:19] overcomer you you cannot be an overcomer
[1:19:25] if you
[1:19:27] haven't
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] fought there's a battle that is said
[1:19:35] before
[1:19:36] you you have to fight and win that
[1:19:41] battle each and every one of
[1:19:45] us because after the
[1:19:49] opening uh if you read uh Revelation 5
[1:19:53] verse 9 my
[1:19:57] brother so that is the importance of the
[1:20:00] seventh
[1:20:04] seal what is so important about the
[1:20:06] seventh
[1:20:09] City now in verse 9 verse in Revelation
[1:20:13] chapter
[1:20:15] 5 and they sang a new song saying Thou
[1:20:19] Art Worthy to take the book and to open
[1:20:22] the seals thereof for thou was
[1:20:25] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:20:28] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[1:20:31] and people and Nation you remember that
[1:20:35] John
[1:20:38] wept when there was no one
[1:20:42] found that could take the
[1:20:45] book and open
[1:20:47] it and then the Bible said it was said
[1:20:51] to
[1:20:52] John weep not
[1:20:56] the lion of the tribe of
[1:21:00] Judah right now after the lion of the
[1:21:03] tribe of
[1:21:09] Judah then they started singing a new
[1:21:14] song after it was
[1:21:17] PR but I want you to notice one
[1:21:22] thing it is said
[1:21:25] the lion of the tribe of
[1:21:28] Judah has
[1:21:30] prevailed but if you read Revelation
[1:21:35] 5 Verse 6 verse can you read it my
[1:21:40] brother and I beheld and low in the
[1:21:43] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:21:45] beast and in the midst of the elders
[1:21:48] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[1:21:51] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[1:21:54] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[1:21:57] the
[1:21:59] earth now the lion of the tribe of
[1:22:03] Jud has prevailed and here we see the
[1:22:09] lamb and when the seals were
[1:22:13] open we see brother
[1:22:16] Brenham coming from the
[1:22:21] westward to open
[1:22:26] now which is
[1:22:28] which the Bible says the lion of the
[1:22:33] tribe of
[1:22:35] Judah that is the
[1:22:39] prophecy but though when the
[1:22:41] manifestation
[1:22:44] comes we see the
[1:22:47] lamb taking the
[1:22:49] book but when we go to Revelation
[1:22:52] chapter 10
[1:22:55] we see the angel with an open
[1:23:00] book and then the promise is but in the
[1:23:05] days of the
[1:23:08] voice because when John was about to
[1:23:11] write said John
[1:23:14] stop that will be
[1:23:16] revealed in the days of the
[1:23:20] voice of the seven angel
[1:23:25] but the
[1:23:26] prophecy said the
[1:23:29] lamb I mean it says the lion has
[1:23:33] prevailed we saw the lamb and then we
[1:23:36] see
[1:23:38] now Revelation
[1:23:41] 107 in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:45] seventh
[1:23:46] angel when he shall
[1:23:51] begin all Mysteries should be
[1:23:54] that's why now brother B comes
[1:23:58] in okay we will talk about those
[1:24:01] things
[1:24:03] right so let's
[1:24:07] continue so now we are
[1:24:11] here
[1:24:13] saying the ministry should be
[1:24:17] relevant and if the ministry is
[1:24:22] relevant there is
[1:24:25] power because
[1:24:28] if you you you you you you are you you
[1:24:31] are
[1:24:34] aligned with what God wants during that
[1:24:39] time we are pleasing
[1:24:41] God and God is Duty bound to hear
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] you and God is Duty bound to answer you
[1:24:55] because you are doing what he wants you
[1:24:57] to
[1:24:58] do at that specific time it's
[1:25:04] relevant there's no way that you can
[1:25:06] miss a
[1:25:08] point when you have the relevant
[1:25:13] Ministry When you pray having the
[1:25:16] relevant
[1:25:18] Ministry isy bound to hear
[1:25:23] you because the relevant
[1:25:27] Ministry makes you the Son of
[1:25:30] God the relevant
[1:25:33] Ministry makes you the revealed
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:38] way now if you are the revealed
[1:25:43] way it will be
[1:25:46] God speaking to
[1:25:48] God there's no way that you can you can
[1:25:51] miss it
[1:25:57] are we
[1:25:59] together God speaking to
[1:26:03] God the Son of God speaking to
[1:26:09] God that is why one
[1:26:11] day in
[1:26:13] John
[1:26:15] chapter uh
[1:26:17] 17 oh Lord Jesus Christ let's open it
[1:26:25] you claim it because when you are
[1:26:29] right when you are right with
[1:26:33] God you have to claim what is
[1:26:38] yours can you read the first verse my
[1:26:43] brother these words spake Jesus and
[1:26:46] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[1:26:49] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[1:26:52] that thy son also May glorify you see
[1:26:56] now he's
[1:26:58] claing he says the words spake Jesus and
[1:27:03] lifted up his eyes to heaven and say
[1:27:09] father the hour has
[1:27:12] come right amen glorify thy
[1:27:16] son that thy son Also may
[1:27:21] glorify you see the right min
[1:27:25] he was definitely
[1:27:28] sure that he has glorified the
[1:27:32] father there's no point that the father
[1:27:36] could not glorify
[1:27:40] him amen look what he says verse two
[1:27:46] listen as thou given him Power Over All
[1:27:50] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[1:27:53] to as many as thou has given him so now
[1:27:58] he has to give eternal
[1:28:04] life once he says and thou has given him
[1:28:10] power that they might Know
[1:28:14] Thee sorry sorry verse two thou has
[1:28:17] given him Power Over All
[1:28:21] Flesh it's like when he says
[1:28:26] uh when he speaks about the the joshuas
[1:28:30] will come to
[1:28:32] that it's God that
[1:28:35] says Pentecostal has
[1:28:39] failed and
[1:28:41] God with the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost will
[1:28:47] raise Joshua that will give us our
[1:28:51] inheritance
[1:28:54] it's the
[1:28:56] word that comes from the
[1:28:59] prophet and the word that comes from the
[1:29:03] prophet of God when the prophet
[1:29:08] speaks it's God
[1:29:11] speaking now
[1:29:13] if the promise is
[1:29:16] that God will raise
[1:29:21] Joshua that will give us our
[1:29:26] inheritance then if there's any Joshua a
[1:29:29] soal
[1:29:31] Joshua that cannot give us
[1:29:36] inheritance then he's in an irrelevant
[1:29:42] Ministry because if the ministry is
[1:29:45] relevant I must have my
[1:29:48] inheritance you must have
[1:29:51] inhance because it's the promise
[1:29:56] are we
[1:29:57] together that is why
[1:29:59] now here he says thou has given him
[1:30:05] power he's
[1:30:07] claiming father you have given me
[1:30:12] power and with that
[1:30:15] power over All
[1:30:20] Flesh that
[1:30:22] I should give
[1:30:27] hear what he
[1:30:28] says he says you've given me power to
[1:30:32] give
[1:30:33] them eternal
[1:30:36] life right now that he has given them
[1:30:41] power to give them eternal
[1:30:44] life as many as thou has given
[1:30:49] him am amen amen verse three he says and
[1:30:55] this is life
[1:30:57] eternal that they might Know
[1:31:01] Thee you see if you do the right
[1:31:06] thing there's nobody that will miss
[1:31:09] it as long as you have given me the
[1:31:13] power and I gave them the
[1:31:16] word there's not even a single one that
[1:31:19] will
[1:31:22] miss as long there's a
[1:31:25] promise of the seventh
[1:31:28] seed and there's a
[1:31:31] Joshua who will give you
[1:31:34] inheritance there's no way that you'll
[1:31:36] miss
[1:31:40] it it's the promise it's the word of God
[1:31:47] look when the
[1:31:50] angel came to Mary
[1:31:54] what is
[1:31:56] important was not the
[1:31:59] angel what is
[1:32:00] important was the word that the angel
[1:32:06] carried you see
[1:32:09] amen the angel
[1:32:11] said You shall
[1:32:15] conceive you see and Mary believe
[1:32:18] that the angel carried the word from
[1:32:21] eternity
[1:32:24] there's no way that that
[1:32:27] word can miss a
[1:32:32] point are we
[1:32:34] together it's like uh this
[1:32:39] quotation that is on the seventh
[1:32:43] seal when the prophet spoke about the
[1:32:46] angel that flew right to him
[1:32:54] it's on this book The Seven
[1:32:57] SE in paragraph
[1:33:01] 4077 then listen to what the
[1:33:05] prophet now the angel was to my
[1:33:10] left will be will will really be the
[1:33:15] last or the seventh
[1:33:21] angel if we count them from left to
[1:33:28] right now you hear what he
[1:33:31] says he says now will be will really be
[1:33:36] the
[1:33:38] last or the seventh
[1:33:43] angel right amen now the seventh
[1:33:48] angel communicate with the seventh
[1:33:51] minister
[1:33:56] the Bible speaks about the seventh angel
[1:34:00] but in the days of the
[1:34:07] voice are we
[1:34:09] together now let me put it this
[1:34:13] way each and every one of
[1:34:16] us when we were
[1:34:19] born we were born in sin
[1:34:24] amen and then when we were born in
[1:34:27] sin we had
[1:34:31] our
[1:34:34] uh like uh we have our national
[1:34:44] life we didn't have divine
[1:34:49] nature we had nature we had our nature
[1:34:52] of our nation
[1:34:57] but after hearing the word of
[1:35:00] God and then the W was now implanted in
[1:35:06] us and the W germinated in
[1:35:10] us until we reach the St of a perfect
[1:35:17] man and when we reach the St of a
[1:35:19] perfect
[1:35:22] man and then God said this is my beloved
[1:35:27] Son and then he anointed
[1:35:30] us then that is when you receive your
[1:35:34] Eternal uh
[1:35:38] body which we call your
[1:35:42] theop now that theop is your
[1:35:48] angel there is your physical you
[1:35:54] and the supernatural
[1:35:58] you now the supernatural
[1:36:02] you goes according to the revelation of
[1:36:06] the
[1:36:10] way okay we'll come to that now it says
[1:36:14] now the angel okay
[1:36:16] fine he he was on my
[1:36:20] left then me looking to him towards the
[1:36:26] West him coming towards the
[1:36:30] east will be on the
[1:36:34] left so that would be the last Angel
[1:36:41] message and then he says very
[1:36:47] notable you know if they say something
[1:36:50] is notable
[1:36:54] is very
[1:36:57] important and very
[1:37:00] interesting if it's
[1:37:05] notable usually notable
[1:37:09] people are very powerful
[1:37:12] people it's not
[1:37:16] people remember how I said he had his he
[1:37:20] got his uh he had he got his back I mean
[1:37:24] his head
[1:37:27] back it was flying
[1:37:30] angel and his great sh
[1:37:34] Wings how he flew right into
[1:37:40] me he flew right to
[1:37:46] me
[1:37:48] okay there is this saying
[1:37:53] I've got Jesus in my
[1:37:57] heart now if you say you've got Jesus in
[1:37:59] your
[1:38:00] heart do you mean there's another
[1:38:04] man that entered into your
[1:38:13] bodyes no yes through the W of
[1:38:19] God when the word is revealed unto you
[1:38:23] changes your your your your natural
[1:38:29] life into the Divine
[1:38:34] Life I always
[1:38:37] say we are human
[1:38:41] beings we are born and bred on this
[1:38:44] Earth but we supposed to go to
[1:38:48] heaven now uh in the olden days
[1:38:54] we we thought that God is very
[1:38:59] far that's why we say our heavenly
[1:39:02] father
[1:39:07] to but are you
[1:39:11] aware that he has potentially
[1:39:17] descended hallu he has potentially
[1:39:20] descended into your heart
[1:39:25] through the revealed
[1:39:28] way amen now when he flew to
[1:39:33] him he was descending into his
[1:39:40] heart I'll explain
[1:39:42] that because he speaks
[1:39:45] about how he flew right to me
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:56] it's it's like some people might think
[1:39:59] that maybe he he got through the mouth
[1:40:02] or maybe open his mouth and got into his
[1:40:08] mouth let me give you an
[1:40:11] example if you read another
[1:40:15] book uh this
[1:40:18] book uh I'll I'll quote it for you
[1:40:23] it says here notice after the battle was
[1:40:29] over is this book
[1:40:34] uh I think it's
[1:40:37] a exposition of the seven Church
[1:40:41] ages of the church ages some they
[1:40:44] haven't got the paragraphs oh no this is
[1:40:47] who is
[1:40:48] thisis who is this paragraph 105
[1:40:52] paragraph 105 notice after the battle
[1:40:55] was
[1:40:57] over M served his Victorious child
[1:41:06] communion that that is
[1:41:08] Abraham after the
[1:41:11] battle then he gave him
[1:41:15] communion okay the pastor Tau
[1:41:19] us the difference between the communion
[1:41:24] and
[1:41:31] lot there's a bread and
[1:41:34] wine and washing of
[1:41:36] feet and there's
[1:41:40] communion now
[1:41:42] communion is when God commune
[1:41:48] with now
[1:41:50] Abraham was standing here
[1:41:54] MC was standing there but in
[1:41:59] Abraham in the heart of
[1:42:03] abrah you know the Bible
[1:42:06] says Abraham was sitting at the door of
[1:42:10] his
[1:42:12] tent he saw three men coming
[1:42:15] to brother Bram
[1:42:18] says uh Abraham Abraham saw him
[1:42:24] while he was still in the pillar of
[1:42:27] fire before he get into that
[1:42:31] body so when he sees that
[1:42:35] man he knows that now this is not a
[1:42:41] normal there's a
[1:42:45] supernatural in that
[1:42:48] body so when they start communicating
[1:42:54] so Prophet says notice after the battle
[1:42:59] was
[1:43:02] over
[1:43:04] MCC served his Victorious
[1:43:15] child not Bread and Wine
[1:43:20] only no but even communion
[1:43:25] he communicated with
[1:43:29] him now the prophet says think of
[1:43:34] that part of
[1:43:37] himself so when they were
[1:43:42] communicating uh the prophet says he was
[1:43:45] giving off
[1:43:48] himself it's it's like when the pastor
[1:43:51] stand year behind this cool
[1:43:56] and you are sitting down
[1:43:58] there there's an anointing in
[1:44:03] him that is it's not the pastor
[1:44:08] communic it's it's what is in
[1:44:13] him am and you are not receiving
[1:44:17] him as a human
[1:44:20] being you receive the word
[1:44:24] through your
[1:44:25] heart so whenever you come to the
[1:44:29] service you you you you you see be
[1:44:33] beyond the person that is on the PO
[1:44:38] pit because he's communicating with your
[1:44:44] soul are we
[1:44:46] together so now he
[1:44:48] says notice after the battle was over
[1:44:53] MC served his
[1:44:58] Victorious
[1:45:01] yeah then he goes on and think of
[1:45:05] that part of
[1:45:09] himself now we want we want to see
[1:45:14] here in type
[1:45:17] here in
[1:45:20] view the communion
[1:45:23] you see amen the
[1:45:26] type in
[1:45:28] view the communion is not touching any
[1:45:34] bread talking about
[1:45:37] commun you see the power of the relevant
[1:45:43] Ministry at the
[1:45:46] time what gave Abraham that
[1:45:51] power knew
[1:45:54] what to expect at that
[1:45:57] time and and what is his promise at
[1:46:02] that you'll never miss a
[1:46:05] point when you know the promise of your
[1:46:12] time then he
[1:46:15] continues after the
[1:46:17] battle he gave off himself
[1:46:24] that is
[1:46:25] why you take all the church
[1:46:29] ages and The
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:33] Messengers most of their of
[1:46:36] their
[1:46:40] Ministry uh you see them at the diling
[1:46:46] point you see
[1:46:49] Paul when he bring his ministry now
[1:46:54] when he was about to
[1:46:56] go so his ministry will Dil with that
[1:46:59] one
[1:47:03] ofus brother Brenham brother the Bible
[1:47:07] says he will turn their
[1:47:11] heart of the children to their
[1:47:16] fathers in other words now that is
[1:47:20] restoration but after restoration
[1:47:25] God gave him
[1:47:27] now a new
[1:47:31] commission now there are
[1:47:34] people that stop there at the
[1:47:39] restoration
[1:47:42] restored Paul set up a
[1:47:45] foundation Paul was a
[1:47:48] prophet and brother Bram was a
[1:47:51] prophet so for our father's
[1:47:56] support then he took the ministry I mean
[1:47:59] he took us
[1:48:01] back and then
[1:48:03] thereafter when we are
[1:48:07] okay then there comes
[1:48:09] now a new
[1:48:13] Commission Now that new
[1:48:16] commission is what we call the seventh
[1:48:20] seat that new Commission
[1:48:23] what we call the third
[1:48:27] pool what is the seventh
[1:48:31] SE what is the third
[1:48:34] pool okay we'll go to the so you see it
[1:48:39] now at the end of his
[1:48:42] ministry when brother Brenham was about
[1:48:45] to
[1:48:47] die the ministry changes
[1:48:53] now it's another
[1:48:56] dispensation of the same
[1:48:58] person then with Moses and and and and
[1:49:02] and
[1:49:04] Joshua it was
[1:49:06] Moses that moved
[1:49:08] out and reach the Red
[1:49:12] Sea it was another
[1:49:14] dispensation it was a Ministry now after
[1:49:18] crossing
[1:49:19] over and then it's another dispensation
[1:49:23] and the ministry
[1:49:25] changes are we together when they reach
[1:49:31] Kadesh the River
[1:49:33] Jordan then the ministry of Moses was
[1:49:39] finished and then he took his way and he
[1:49:42] went up the
[1:49:43] mountain and Joshua took
[1:49:47] over now Joshua Joshua had to give them
[1:49:51] their inheritance
[1:49:57] it's it's now the relevant Ministry at
[1:50:00] that
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:03] time it has nothing to do with the
[1:50:08] desert or the Red
[1:50:11] Sea or
[1:50:14] egpt
[1:50:15] now there is the captain of The Host
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:23] now he says I
[1:50:27] am the captain of the
[1:50:32] host now the seven
[1:50:35] SE it's like
[1:50:38] that when now the new
[1:50:42] commission
[1:50:43] start the captain of the host Tak
[1:50:50] over but you don't see
[1:50:53] anybody you see Joshua
[1:50:56] fighting the battle that was
[1:51:00] fought it was fought by
[1:51:02] Joshua but the captain said I am the
[1:51:07] captain
[1:51:09] of
[1:51:12] right the
[1:51:14] battle that is fought here
[1:51:18] now you see the pastor fighting the B

[1:51:33] understand when the man stands
[1:51:37] here there's a captain behind
[1:51:42] you are are you
[1:51:45] together and you
[1:51:48] remember Caleb said
[1:51:53] there was a time when
[1:51:56] Moses sent Caleb and
[1:52:03] Joshua to spy the
[1:52:07] land and
[1:52:08] Moses promise
[1:52:15] cbon and now what was in
[1:52:21] hebon they
[1:52:24] canites the Canaanites were not uh human
[1:52:29] to to that
[1:52:33] extent they they they were
[1:52:36] tall
[1:52:38] Giants there had six fingers on each
[1:52:42] hand six toes
[1:52:46] yeah you know
[1:52:49] golad is that type
[1:52:54] and their
[1:52:56] cities were
[1:53:02] fortified you couldn't go there but look
[1:53:05] at
[1:53:06] Caleb he said to
[1:53:10] Joshua that's my
[1:53:15] place that's the one Moses promised
[1:53:20] me because it's
[1:53:23] Caleb and Joshua that said we will eat
[1:53:28] them are we
[1:53:31] together right there it is now what we
[1:53:35] need to
[1:53:37] know you must have
[1:53:39] faith and
[1:53:41] believe that there's a captain of
[1:53:45] [Applause]
[1:53:47] the we together
[1:53:52] you could never have a
[1:53:56] revelation without
[1:53:59] faith the Bible
[1:54:02] says without faith you can't please
[1:54:10] God because what God do he hides
[1:54:14] himself in a
[1:54:18] man and then you need to have that faith
[1:54:22] that God has hidden himself in
[1:54:26] that Elohim El hided
[1:54:30] himself in the
[1:54:32] body
[1:54:35] ofc was a
[1:54:37] man but
[1:54:39] Moses had that faith that is why we are
[1:54:43] called the children of of
[1:54:49] Abraham Abraham was a Hebrew
[1:54:52] we are Zulus and
[1:54:56] and how can we be the Seed of
[1:55:00] Abraham through
[1:55:02] faith

[1:55:08] had the very same faith
[1:55:12] that so we are the Seed of
[1:55:20] Abraham right are we together
[1:55:23] so now that's that's how now he
[1:55:28] flew right to
[1:55:34] brother and through
[1:55:37] faith brother Brenham knew that now it's
[1:55:42] in
[1:55:43] me read

[1:58:43] power of the
[1:58:46] manifestation of the ministry
[1:58:52] you know the changing of the world
[1:58:56] situation and even the
[1:59:01] structures uh affect the manifestation
[1:59:04] of the
[1:59:11] prophets when when the prophet the
[1:59:14] prophecy is
[1:59:18] manifested there should be some shaking
[1:59:24] the prophet
[1:59:26] says God will present
[1:59:31] Christ with a beloved
[1:59:36] bride let's read that
[1:59:38] one the first son the first
[1:59:42] son Adam was the spoken seed word of
[1:59:49] God you he what he says was a spoken
[1:59:53] seed
[1:59:59] word he was given the bride to produce
[2:00:08] himself the first
[2:00:10] Adam was given a
[2:00:12] bride so that he should produce himself
[2:00:16] the ch right
[2:00:18] Amen to produce another Son of God
[2:00:26] but she
[2:00:29] fell the
[2:00:31] bride right she fell by high
[2:00:39] bation then she caused him to
[2:00:43] Die the second
[2:00:46] son
[2:00:48] Jesus also a spoken seed word of God
[2:00:56] was given a
[2:00:58] bright like
[2:01:01] Adam but before he could marry
[2:01:05] her she also had
[2:01:10] fallen she like Adam's
[2:01:14] wife was put to
[2:01:18] test whether she would believe the word
[2:01:22] of God and live or doubt the
[2:01:27] we and die she
[2:01:31] doubted she left the we she
[2:01:36] died right amen now we speaking about
[2:01:40] the
[2:01:43] Pentecostals now from a little
[2:01:46] group of the true seed of the way
[2:01:52] that should be
[2:01:54] [Applause]
[2:01:56] you because Jesus was
[2:02:01] given a spoken seed word of
[2:02:07] God and that was given
[2:02:10] to a
[2:02:12] bride just like like
[2:02:16] Adam but she fell and then he says from
[2:02:19] a little group
[2:02:22] of the true seed of w of the word of
[2:02:26] God now God will present
[2:02:32] Christ a beloved
[2:02:37] bride she is a virgin of his
[2:02:42] weight when he says she is the virgin of
[2:02:46] his
[2:02:47] weight it means
[2:02:50] that she takes the the
[2:02:52] weight under no
[2:02:56] circumstances there's no
[2:02:59] hybrid takes the word as it
[2:03:03] is she doesn't doubt the
[2:03:07] word look we speak about The
[2:03:12] Throne uh we said now the promise to
[2:03:18] us uh the bride
[2:03:22] he said I will
[2:03:24] grant to sit with
[2:03:27] me in my
[2:03:31] Throne where is his
[2:03:34] throne is in our
[2:03:37] heart said now he will sit with
[2:03:40] us in his
[2:03:42] throne and if now he sits with us in his
[2:03:49] throne you receive him by faith
[2:03:55] see what makes you the
[2:03:59] bride is the word that you
[2:04:04] believe if you read in John uh
[2:04:11] 8:37 remember the
[2:04:15] Pharisees and the
[2:04:19] sagues uh were doubting him
[2:04:24] and they said they are the Abra they
[2:04:27] they Abraham
[2:04:29] seed now
[2:04:31] Abraham had faith in the word of
[2:04:34] God believed in
[2:04:37] God
[2:04:38] now Jesus said I know that you are
[2:04:43] Abraham
[2:04:46] seed now he means physical
[2:04:52] because Abraham was their
[2:04:55] father he bir to
[2:04:59] Isaac
[2:05:00] Jacob and the tribe of
[2:05:03] Israel that's why he says I know that
[2:05:08] that you are Abraham
[2:05:11] seed but after I said Abraham
[2:05:16] seed there's a call on
[2:05:18] there you see those two dots
[2:05:23] it joins the other
[2:05:25] sentence but you seek to kill it's
[2:05:30] continuation because my
[2:05:32] word had no
[2:05:37] place see that's how it is now when when
[2:05:42] the
[2:05:43] word uh comes from the mouth of
[2:05:48] God it must find a place
[2:05:54] now when he
[2:05:58] says from a little group of the true
[2:06:01] seed of the
[2:06:08] weight God will present Christ with a
[2:06:12] beloved
[2:06:16] bride when when he says she is a virgin
[2:06:20] of his word
[2:06:23] it means now there
[2:06:26] is uh the word finds a
[2:06:29] place in their
[2:06:33] heart now the word find place in your
[2:06:38] heart when the word find place in your
[2:06:42] heart it
[2:06:46] germinates that's what we call
[2:06:49] bride the bride is the terminated
[2:06:58] weight that's why when she is a
[2:07:02] virgin because she knows no
[2:07:05] man she knows no men's
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:10] Creed or
[2:07:12] dogmas that's what you
[2:07:15] are amen you don't know any Creeds and
[2:07:19] dogmas I the the
[2:07:22] you you know the word that is
[2:07:27] relevant to you to the time that you
[2:07:30] living to your
[2:07:33] dispensation and apart from that there's
[2:07:36] nothing else
[2:07:38] that amen and then he continues and says
[2:07:42] by and through the members of the
[2:07:47] Bride will be fulfilled all that was
[2:07:51] promised of
[2:07:55] God you hear what he
[2:07:58] says by and through the members of the
[2:08:04] Bride who are the members of the
[2:08:09] Bride he says from the group of the true
[2:08:11] seed of
[2:08:16] God then he will fulfill all that was
[2:08:19] promised
[2:08:23] you
[2:08:24] need to be very very
[2:08:29] happy when God want to manifest
[2:08:33] himself he manifest
[2:08:35] himself through
[2:08:37] you
[2:08:39] am when God want to show
[2:08:45] off show of through
[2:08:48] [Applause]
[2:08:50] you there was a time when God showed
[2:08:54] off he said what do you say about my son
[2:08:59] job you
[2:09:02] see he knew that job will never fail
[2:09:07] never regardless of what
[2:09:11] circumstances and you that once the
[2:09:15] word has find creep in your
[2:09:19] heart you will never fail
[2:09:24] never eternity is your
[2:09:28] home you see amen there's nothing that
[2:09:31] will divert you
[2:09:33] from because you
[2:09:38] [Applause]
[2:09:39] predestinated so
[2:09:41] now by and
[2:09:43] through the members of the
[2:09:46] bright will be fulfilled all that was
[2:09:50] promis of God
[2:09:54] to be
[2:09:55] manifested in the
[2:09:57] vision are together
[2:10:00] amen the word
[2:10:03] promise came to the Virgin
[2:10:07] Mary but the Word of
[2:10:10] Promise was
[2:10:14] he amen he
[2:10:17] himself to be made manifest
[2:10:21] when
[2:10:22] Jesus was going around here he was
[2:10:26] manifesting the
[2:10:29] way he was the Word of
[2:10:33] Promise when Isaiah said a virgin shall
[2:10:38] conceive he was talking about him so he
[2:10:41] was moving
[2:10:43] around manifesting
[2:10:45] that when when when the prophet speaks
[2:10:48] about the bride
[2:10:51] about you when you move around you are
[2:10:55] manifesting
[2:10:58] that there's nobody else that can
[2:11:01] manifest that
[2:11:02] way it's only you that can
[2:11:08] man that is why the Bible says no man
[2:11:13] had seen God at any
[2:11:17] time the only begotten son
[2:11:24] which is in the bosom of the
[2:11:26] father he has declared him you know what
[2:11:30] is to
[2:11:31] declare is to announce and
[2:11:36] affirm right
[2:11:38] amen you announce
[2:11:41] publicly or
[2:11:43] officially you
[2:11:47] area you CLA him
[2:11:51] God was
[2:11:53] manifest he
[2:11:56] himself at that
[2:11:58] time and
[2:12:01] fulfilled his own Word of
[2:12:05] Promise in the
[2:12:08] Virgin it was an angel that brought the
[2:12:12] message but the Angel's message was the
[2:12:15] W of
[2:12:19] God are we together
[2:12:21] the angel brought the
[2:12:24] we but the
[2:12:28] message you know but the Angel's
[2:12:31] message was the word of
[2:12:37] God
[2:12:39] now that is why
[2:12:42] now by the the
[2:12:47] events we we we could identify our
[2:12:51] uh
[2:12:55] dispensation because each and every
[2:13:01] dispensation have got a
[2:13:05] scope now what is happening during that
[2:13:10] dispensation you identify your
[2:13:16] position you'll be
[2:13:18] able to spot your mark
[2:13:23] and be
[2:13:24] balanced between the
[2:13:28] past and the
[2:13:30] future amen while you are in
[2:13:34] present when you are here you are able
[2:13:38] to see the past and see the
[2:13:41] future when you are in your
[2:13:45] dispensation in your
[2:13:47] ministry your ministry will show you the
[2:13:50] path
[2:13:51] show you the present show you the the
[2:13:57] future so we are
[2:14:00] covered you know that when you live here
[2:14:03] what's
[2:14:04] following from here on what following
[2:14:08] from your on What's following you are
[2:14:12] balanced are we
[2:14:14] together unlike beaing around the
[2:14:19] bush going up the mountain and pray and
[2:14:24] fast and do all those things while you
[2:14:27] are in the same
[2:14:30] place you know what you
[2:14:33] want now the prophet
[2:14:35] says the
[2:14:39] evils of this
[2:14:42] age fit is fitting to the prophecy for
[2:14:45] this evil
[2:14:49] age this book
[2:14:51] God of this
[2:14:52] evil in paragraph
[2:14:55] 29 he says the God of this evil
[2:15:01] age the
[2:15:03] God of this evil age as we have read in
[2:15:07] the
[2:15:08] scriptures the God of this
[2:15:12] world this evil
[2:15:14] age all all of us knows that this age is
[2:15:20] evil
[2:15:21] [Music]
[2:15:23] each and
[2:15:25] everyone when I go maybe to the
[2:15:29] mall I would say to
[2:15:31] myself I just want to see if I could see
[2:15:36] a welled
[2:15:41] woman I will look around I couldn't find
[2:15:44] even a single
[2:15:47] one you won't find even a single one
[2:15:51] unless maybe I meet some of the
[2:15:54] sisters but
[2:15:56] ordinarily you you see this age is evil
[2:16:00] is Wroten to the
[2:16:02] [Applause]
[2:16:04] call you
[2:16:07] see now he says
[2:16:10] now this now this
[2:16:13] message points out the evils of this
[2:16:19] age and it is is fitting to prophesy for
[2:16:22] this evil
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:28] age you see this message is a
[2:16:32] prophecy this evil AG
[2:16:38] prophesying now notice CL I'm reading
[2:16:41] paragraph 31 31 now notice
[2:16:46] closely now as we study the word
[2:16:52] the God of this evil
[2:16:54] age that we are now
[2:16:57] living may seem
[2:17:00] strange a very strange
[2:17:04] thing in this age of
[2:17:07] Grace when
[2:17:09] God is taking
[2:17:12] people for his name
[2:17:14] sake that is his bride in this evil age
[2:17:19] that should be called the age of evil
[2:17:24] when we say this is evil
[2:17:27] age God rais up his
[2:17:31] bride to prophesy
[2:17:36] against the very
[2:17:39] age that is that God is calling a people
[2:17:43] for his name
[2:17:46] sake by grace and is called an evil age
[2:17:51] now we prove by the
[2:17:54] Bible that this is the
[2:17:57] age that he was speaking
[2:18:00] off very strange thing to think
[2:18:05] that age like
[2:18:07] this that God will be calling
[2:18:12] his you see now the challenge
[2:18:16] is the world has got its own thing
[2:18:22] the bride is condemning the
[2:18:28] world now you cannot be
[2:18:32] enticed by the worldly
[2:18:36] life that's is why your
[2:18:39] work is to prophesy
[2:18:44] against just your your your
[2:18:48] appearance it's a prophecy
[2:18:51] your appearance is a condemnation
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:56] to now he continues and
[2:18:59] say now
[2:19:01] listen for Satan is not I mean now
[2:19:06] listen for Satan is not spoke of as a
[2:19:09] god of another age but this
[2:19:17] age now when Satan is the God of this
[2:19:23] age then we should have a
[2:19:27] bride which represent our
[2:19:32] God and the bride will combat that
[2:19:37] s because he says he's the God of this
[2:19:42] age now the prophet says Satan was not
[2:19:46] the god of the age of Noah
[2:19:51] Satan was not a god of the time of
[2:19:55] Moses Satan was not a God in the time of
[2:20:00] elij this evil
[2:20:03] age he
[2:20:05] is he says don't meet you he is the God
[2:20:09] of this evil
[2:20:11] age worshiped by millions and
[2:20:15] billions and of people and they don't
[2:20:19] know it
[2:20:20] it
[2:20:21] is you look at now even young girls
[2:20:25] young
[2:20:27] boys they are dressed in ritual
[2:20:33] attire you go to any
[2:20:36] River you see them doing
[2:20:39] rituals go to any D you'll see them
[2:20:43] doing
[2:20:44] rituals go to any
[2:20:47] sea and any stream
[2:20:51] you go to any
[2:20:52] school they're doing
[2:20:54] rituals that's why he says he is the God
[2:20:59] of this evil
[2:21:01] age worship by
[2:21:04] millions and billions of people and they
[2:21:08] don't know
[2:21:09] [Music]
[2:21:13] it even at
[2:21:16] school if a child got an attack you pray
[2:21:21] for that child they put you behind bars
[2:21:25] they not supposed to he's speaking to
[2:21:28] his ancestors don't
[2:21:32] dist that's why they say you don't have
[2:21:35] to pray
[2:21:36] for because when you do that you are
[2:21:39] casting away the
[2:21:41] demon and they said that demon is the
[2:21:45] ancestors he's got the
[2:21:47] right he's got the right to communicate
[2:21:50] with they are his
[2:21:52] ancestors you see now he has Creed in
[2:21:56] even in all
[2:21:59] nations
[2:22:03] right when you see the actions of the
[2:22:08] people maybe going to
[2:22:12] church and hear the bells
[2:22:15] ringing now he says now they will they
[2:22:18] will give you the the the
[2:22:22] the you you can have an answer on what
[2:22:24] they
[2:22:26] doing that now they are going to church
[2:22:30] and
[2:22:31] knowingly where the truth
[2:22:38] is our Lord's
[2:22:42] Ministry was
[2:22:45] questioned about the past that was set
[2:22:48] by Moses
[2:22:52] and the power of the
[2:22:56] relevancy in his
[2:22:59] ministry what is what I'm saying
[2:23:02] here that when our Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:23:05] here on
[2:23:08] Earth the
[2:23:10] Pharisees the
[2:23:11] SES the
[2:23:13] scribes we're
[2:23:17] questioning our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:23:21] about the ministry of
[2:23:25] Moses and the power now the power of the
[2:23:34] relevancy was
[2:23:37] uh defeating the the the the
[2:23:42] people they had the
[2:23:45] ministry of
[2:23:48] Moses now when he comes
[2:23:51] it's another
[2:23:53] dispensation that explain exactly what
[2:23:56] Moses was
[2:24:00] doing are we together that yes Moses did
[2:24:03] a good
[2:24:05] thing the time that we are living
[2:24:08] in that Ministry is
[2:24:13] irrelevant the relevant Ministry is this
[2:24:17] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:24:23] Isaiah Moses and everybody was speaking
[2:24:27] about
[2:24:27] him and then when he comes now it's
[2:24:31] another Ministry that is
[2:24:35] relevant that is why say our Lord's our
[2:24:38] Lord's
[2:24:40] Ministry was questioned about the
[2:24:45] past that was uh said by Moses
[2:24:51] and the power of the
[2:24:55] relevancy in his in the Christ
[2:24:59] Ministry corrected the
[2:25:03] past and even set a mark for the
[2:25:07] future it correct the past and set the
[2:25:12] mar yes Moses said so but it was not
[2:25:17] so so correcting the p
[2:25:20] setting a
[2:25:22] mark
[2:25:27] together
[2:25:28] right he
[2:25:32] says you were
[2:25:35] there in his
[2:25:38] attributes you don't remember
[2:25:41] it who can
[2:25:44] remember he says you were there and you
[2:25:48] don't remember
[2:25:50] you cannot remember it with your
[2:25:53] mind when you were
[2:25:56] there you were a
[2:26:00] theop you were
[2:26:04] Supernatural That's why it says you were
[2:26:07] there in his
[2:26:09] attribute you don't remember
[2:26:12] it because you just part of his
[2:26:17] life you are part of God when you become
[2:26:21] a son or a daughter
[2:26:27] of right
[2:26:29] amen then the attribute was first
[2:26:35] God that the pastor always teaches us
[2:26:39] about the then the attribute was first
[2:26:44] God the
[2:26:46] thought the attribute
[2:26:49] itself all in
[2:26:52] one without being
[2:26:55] expressed see without being
[2:26:57] expressed then when he expressed
[2:27:03] secondary he became the
[2:27:06] way and then the word was made
[2:27:09] flesh and dwell Among
[2:27:12] Us are we
[2:27:14] together then when he dwell among us
[2:27:18] then it shows that you were the
[2:27:19] attribute of
[2:27:24] his
[2:27:25] bride is himself
[2:27:27] [Music]
[2:27:30] revealed the word is the
[2:27:32] bride when he says the word is now in
[2:27:35] the
[2:27:38] bride is himself
[2:27:43] revealed now he's giving an
[2:27:46] example about the wise and foolish
[2:27:49] virgin
[2:27:52] says the bride went
[2:27:54] in there's a whole difference between
[2:27:58] the church and the
[2:28:02] bride I'm I'm reading from this spoken
[2:28:05] with the
[2:28:07] breach paragraph
[2:28:09] 265 it says the bride went
[2:28:13] in there's a whole difference between
[2:28:16] the church and the bride
[2:28:22] yes sir am went into the wedding
[2:28:27] Ser the seals were broke
[2:28:31] broke while in the last Church age to
[2:28:35] reveal those
[2:28:38] truth the lamb broke the
[2:28:41] seals and revealed them to his
[2:28:46] CH in
[2:28:48] order to collect his
[2:28:52] subject for his
[2:28:54] kingdom the
[2:28:56] Bri he broke the
[2:28:58] SS in order to collect
[2:29:01] his
[2:29:03] subject his own
[2:29:06] subject for his
[2:29:09] kingdom his subject is his
[2:29:12] bride his bride is the revealed
[2:29:16] way how would you get now when he speaks
[2:29:19] about
[2:29:20] the difference between the
[2:29:25] church he's speaking about the word and
[2:29:29] the revealed
[2:29:31] word the bride is the word that is
[2:29:37] revealed the mystery of
[2:29:40] God is when God and
[2:29:43] Men combine and be one
[2:29:46] thing that is the mystery when God and
[2:29:49] man
[2:29:51] combine and
[2:29:53] one that is the
[2:29:55] mystery he says before they could be a
[2:29:59] creation in your
[2:30:01] heart there has to be a
[2:30:07] creator that create that
[2:30:12] creation are we
[2:30:15] together so
[2:30:20] you see how
[2:30:23] important the relevancy of the
[2:30:28] ministry the ministry of your
[2:30:33] time and the ministry of your
[2:30:36] time makes you a
[2:30:39] god with with with a small
[2:30:42] G that's scripture on John chapter 10
[2:30:46] brother har John 10
[2:30:50] uh John 10 you start from verse
[2:30:58] 30 I and my father Are One
[2:31:02] MH then the Jews took up stones again to
[2:31:05] Stone him Jesus answered them many good
[2:31:09] works have I show you from my father for
[2:31:13] which of those Works do you Stone me the
[2:31:16] Jews answered him saying for a good work
[2:31:19] we Stone the not but for blasphemy and
[2:31:23] because that thou being a man makest
[2:31:26] thyself
[2:31:27] God Jesus answered them is it not
[2:31:30] written in your law I said ye are Gods
[2:31:34] yeah just stop
[2:31:37] there it says it's written in your
[2:31:42] law that ye are
[2:31:46] Gods can you see that g
[2:31:52] it's not a
[2:31:54] cap you are
[2:31:58] God
[2:32:00] continue if he called them Gods unto
[2:32:03] whom the word of God came stop if you
[2:32:07] call them God small
[2:32:11] je unto whom the word of God capital
[2:32:18] G came and the scripture cannot be
[2:32:22] broken you see now you are a god with a
[2:32:27] small
[2:32:28] G so now when the word is in you it
[2:32:33] makes you
[2:32:35] God that worship God a god with a small
[2:32:40] G it's like it's like when the word
[2:32:42] comes unto
[2:32:45] you you find you you've got a
[2:32:48] spirit the scripture we have in
[2:32:52] uh Romans 8:1
[2:32:56] 16 ver
[2:33:01] 16 the spirit itself beareth witness
[2:33:05] with our spirit yeah now it's speaking
[2:33:09] about two
[2:33:12] Spirits it says the spirit Capital as
[2:33:15] you
[2:33:18] see that is called
[2:33:20] Spirit be witness with our spirit small
[2:33:23] as you
[2:33:27] see that we are the children of
[2:33:30] God it's when now the prophet
[2:33:34] says that is the
[2:33:37] anointing Christ is the
[2:33:40] anointing the spirit comes upon the
[2:33:46] word that quickens the word
[2:33:51] when you read the
[2:33:52] word then there should be a spirit that
[2:33:56] comes and
[2:34:00] quickens you see so that you should
[2:34:05] understand to make it
[2:34:08] live when you read it you are reading
[2:34:12] it but apart from
[2:34:15] go if God does not Quicken it
[2:34:20] that word is not
[2:34:22] alive you are just
[2:34:24] reading so there is no
[2:34:27] Revelation but God must Quicken
[2:34:33] it it quickens the word to make it
[2:34:38] live now the word is in your
[2:34:42] heart then you believe it's like if you
[2:34:45] read First
[2:34:48] Corinthians chapter uh uh 15 Corinthians
[2:34:54] verse
[2:34:54] 45 I think I'm closing
[2:34:57] now
[2:34:59] now the
[2:35:01] ministry of your time is is an
[2:35:05] anointing like brother
[2:35:08] Bram when he was speaking to
[2:35:13] Sister he got an
[2:35:16] anointing and when he went when he he
[2:35:20] received the the the the the the third
[2:35:23] pool
[2:35:25] Ministry he went to hunt
[2:35:29] squirrel and then God said to
[2:35:32] him do you want squirrels says how many
[2:35:37] he says three then he says under that
[2:35:40] anointing it was in me saying
[2:35:45] that it was God saying
[2:35:48] there even when he was speaking to
[2:35:53] Sister he says it was God
[2:35:56] speaking same God that was in
[2:36:00] him in
[2:36:02] sister when sister
[2:36:05] said The Souls of my two
[2:36:09] boys then it was God
[2:36:13] saying because
[2:36:15] nobody who is very very
[2:36:18] poor who is
[2:36:20] hungry who has got no
[2:36:23] clothes can call a soul he's going to
[2:36:26] speak about food in the house and things
[2:36:28] like
[2:36:30] that he going to speak about the
[2:36:32] problems that he's
[2:36:34] facing we together yeah now it says God

[2:37:14] Soul that's what the Bible
[2:37:17] says man was made a
[2:37:21] soul that is
[2:37:23] alive somebody that has God soul in
[2:37:28] himself but with Jesus Christ he was a
[2:37:31] quickening
[2:37:33] spirit any word that comes out of your
[2:37:37] mouth was quicking was changing
[2:37:43] you the last
