TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for [Music] we H I prayed for uh a a sister from so she was brought to my house she couldn't walk and told me that she was Bewitched by her aunt something like that okay they helped her walked her into my house now I said to her now I'm going to preach for you to pray for you if you believe you'll be healed if you can believe because I believe now you also Must Believe amen amen then while I was talking H she asked for the restroom and uh I I could see that she was managed to stand up on yourself but the husband still mindful of yes and uh he he he tried to hold her and I said no just leave her but anyhow he insisted because that thing was still in his that if he she can try to do it she will drop down so I have to help so I just left them like that by the time we finished I prayed for her and as they walked out H she could walk amen amen now the thing is before I prayed for her already she was healed why amen she believed the word I I spoke to her the healer is the word you know sometimes uh if if if a person believes I can say to to him or her if he says I'm sick like I did in Cameroon very yeah brother was there a sister said her business is to sell fish Fri fish and so forth said pastor my hand is this this this I I I've got the photos of her children she gave me the photo of her children said you keep my children now the following day we driving somewhere else to the Sea when we just h a brother the the brother who led us there he asked he asked asked just to check the sister where she is doing her business now when she said to me my hand is so so I said what I just hold my hand I said you are all right don't it is because I saw the sister that she believed me now you listen she didn't believe me as God she believe the way that I spoke [Applause] to amen because why God said to brother B people to believe amen amen you know H because uh they come to the prophet are believing okay amen but now God wants them to locate to believe God where he is to believe him from where he is amen amen it will be a better thing as it was a better thing for the human beings God knew that the best thing is to become like them because H is then I'll be accepted I must become like amen amen one time before he took that form as Jesus he was on the mountain didn't the people run away and yet they said to Moses uhuh we can also see God we also want to see God all the time it's you no give us a chance he reported to God that the people uh they are protesting they want to H privatize this thing amen so God said to Moses let amen running away from the mountain they even said it is better Moses that we hear from you amen amen you see amen now H God was closer to them okay amen all right but they wanted to overtake and overrun Moses thinking that they will come and stand before God and say yeah we have come ourselves now because Moses is always coming alone here now we are here ourselves they couldn't reach him the only way they could reach him that's when he is in Moses amen otherwise they didn't reach him even today the same thing amen amen you couldn't reach the seven SE until they were in brother when they are in aen because God dwells in the sture of amen amen and if you can see who God is then you'll be able to see what kind of men he has made okay amen oh let me finish my statement amen um the reason people can't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it what their mind conceives but the mind will reason it can not be oh sorry Sor okay let me go where it you'll understand all right like somebody is prayed for and you say Jesus Christ has healed you now he listens from the mind that that pain is still there amen amen amen so now he will keep that pain in his mind and as long as he's keeping the pain in his mind the pain will remain in his toe amen amen and until he let go and believe what the word has said because if the the word says you are healed it is like let be light amen amen and so now he says now listen this where I was coming uh when once that faith comes down into the compartment down here in the compartment it will never amen amen so once it is in the compartment there is the reason people doesn't get where they should be this morning the people are struggling striving but they don't reach the they don't get where they should be amen with or whatever like when someone has a dog on a leash yeah on a leash this is the word I want on Le then sometimes the dog would would like to attack maybe another dog but because it is on the leash amen it will run up to here because the owner is holding tight on the other side so but it will run but he will pull it you get what him Satan does the same thing he can put you on the Le you come and say Jesus Jesus Jesus so you can't just reach the place now you remain with a wishire but you don't reach it amen amen sing closer goder to God now it's not just to be closed no it's to reach the place know the Bible says he God says he who finds me finds life and it says seek the Lord and find him instead the people are finding churches it says seek the Lord and find him okay amen uh here the last thing it says but when once that faith comes down into that compartment that means the faith must come in the compartment which is the soul not in the mind but in the soul then there will never be a question because there the faith can bloom amen am if you can hold the seed close to the ground it won't germinate you must bury it in the ground amen now if you you you you you you you have your uh faith and you keep it in the mind it won't bring results [Music] it becomes just a belief I believe amen but what you believe must happen you can't just say I believe that men should eat and yet you don't eat you are [Applause] fasting sometimes you faint because of hunger must eat but you're notating amen so it's a believe without the manifestation if you believe a thing then you do [Applause] it if you believe that God Christ Is A Healer then you you get healed because you believe that he is the Healer amen amen this is the main thing there is the reason people don't get where they should be Monday to Monday they are just the same it is like if you find a preacher who's getting nowhere amen amen every day repent repent repent that's all as I said last night in London um they uh gave a title how I don't know maybe brother can remember it was about the Holy receiving the holy ghost or something today now ministers were supposed to dwell on that yeah they were supposed to do so now I brought this message uh from the spoken words I've shown it yesterday that we have seven Church Ages which is the work of the Holy Ghost and the prophet says throughout the seven churches he is the holy ghost from the first churches to the seven Church it stops there amen amen the Holy Ghost has done its work [Applause] the Holy Ghost was responsible for the church ages that's why throughout the Holy Ghost throughout the church ages am it says he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches now if you go beyond the seven seches do you find that no it's beyond all right now maybe I'm trying to talk about this H the brothers asked a question everywhere okay don't worry we'll F ourselves this question by if then the seven seal you say brings him to the and uh Redemption is over why are we still baptizing the people you are also asking the same question now listen The Book of Daniel also says Daniel Daniel um every one of your people will be found written in the book everyone whose name shall be found in the book shall be saved and at the end it says in the books were open so he judged according to the names in the book so brother says you are not safed today no you were saved before that is the word of God [Applause] I'm going to read it to you that is the word of God you were saved before that's why I see parents you know our children are are they are children now parents sometimes even if a child can do something wrong they will try to hide it amen am now you who tries to bring it to light you get a beating okay amen they want they don't want their children they don't want their children to be exposed but the Bible says the says if you reveal sin are wise and you'll be cleansed amen he who hides his sin is not wise he who hides his child sin amen amen now you find now you see children you can't pray for that child because the mother is hiding the sin of the church okay amen but the wise mama is the one who brings the child and say this child has seen pastor this child that's a wise a wise mama and she will save the child now what I'm trying to come to is this one uh the people they want their relatives to go to heaven they want their parents to go to heav they want their children to go to heaven amen amen there's a an gospel artist Inland one of his songs he was not believing God his s he didn't want to go to church not believing God at all amen amen the he amen when you want to hear people talking lies go to the funerals a man being shot by the police bus stealing say now he's an angel them where you are going tell them we are also on the way we are coming person who was sh people but when he dies push him into heaven they say greet them there and they even call him the angel all right amen that's why I'm saying people believe that it's like when a child has wrong they say to him [Music] he how are go and see the pastor amen amen with a ni in the pocket go and see the pastor and they even one brought his son and low drugs having beat him down the brother says to me I'm also saying maybe I should come I say brother no we're not going back to church we get saved amen amen drunk of the drugs when I looked at him I told him father I told him I see drugs all over you he just Smiles he says to me I'm reducing them a little bit little by little I'm just left withar and girlfriend you have to be to come trying to the says if he is found in the book H you you don't push him in he he is called [Applause] am even when the pastor can pray for him today today they don't just pray they they Splash them with water and they oil them fire trying everything in their want to work it is only those found written in the book they are the ones that will be saved amen amen the brother says the brother says there's nothing wrong with the he's going to heaven I said brother finish that thing amen amen now he said when he is predestinated when he dies as a child predestinated predestinated it's not like him he was supposed to be you don't get saved like that let's read it amen the other ones they say now he's trying that when he has a child this child must go to heaven now he doesn't ask first from God the prophet says he's a child's nothing he'll go to heaven provided his or her name is [Applause] written all right amen others come and say a pastor beets a I said sure is it like that is it like that a sign of the pastor is a pastor Pastor begs a past it is it there okay amen I asked now which Pastor has given you see it's just a wish know that maybe he wishes that he can also give the say it's only those whose names were found written in the book that will be saved not because he is a child of a pastor that's right was struggling with her children with theet he was struggling with his own children okay amen you want to tell me that a prophet must give birth to a prophet now the other time he comes so he Lov Joseph he said is he going to be a prophet or he's a prophet he said something he'll be a prophet amen amen then come after that said now this the this Prophet is now Joseph Jose Joseph has taken over the the office of a prophet I said no said Joseph will be a prophet or something like that I said the prophet say a prophet is a brid AET sometimes it means that when they put you there having you put you there not your dad said you will be a prophet amen amen now when they pour oil on you you don't understand but what are they seeing in me this people amen amen all right now the books of the Prophet you must be careful what you reading about Hallelujah I was testifying one day the people the Bible is it Revelation 7 it says John saw multitudes coming from the tribulation and they were given white robes amen uh the first group he saw was the Jews so he recognized them but then he saw another group and he say its multitude Nations coming from the tribulation and brother B they asked brother BR is that the bride he said yes amen amen then after that when the seals were open then brother Bram said that is not the bride because the bride is not coming from the great you see the thing but you have the people today still sticking to that the bride from the coming from the tribulation nobody I can prove to brother amen amen so you you need to follow the prophet so now I was just testifying about it when the brothers kept silent they were looking at me in a very funny way because they were preachers of the same thing they were the preachers of that now one brother was laughing we were petur laughing now I also wondered why this these others look so sad says I won't name the people but one of our beloved Brothers here was preaching he even asked us to sing a song now who are these ones they coming from the trations of the world and even cry when they sing of Christ just of the tribulations amen amen now he says we even sang that song God was say repeat it it says where are they coming from from the tribulations of the world Prophet says I the bride of Christ that is not the bride of [Music] [Applause] Christ the tribes he has the the tribes of Israel he has seen and the multitudes that's during the tribulation period of which brother say 144,000 144,000 is called out during that time and the remant of the Gentiles those who missed the Rapture but still they will keep themselves and God will reward them amen amen now it says he will give them white robes but he says H they will never not be in Jerusalem they will recite outside amen because they don't come in the first resurrection they were not taken up in the Rapture but they were just good people not perfect people so God gave them robes and said you saw me when I was in you saw me when I was those on his right hand at the Judgment through hey you must read the word of God Amen that is not the bride he says some like goats on the left and some like sheep on the right then he shall say to the Sheep you've seen you you you you you saw me me when I was in jail you saw me when I was hungry you saw and then the prophet says that is the people who has missed the Rapture but because of their good works amen because the bride of Christ is not saved by the good words she is predestinated that's the difference amen when you put it in there compartment then no question it be when Aon when the the RO of Aon was put in there together with the other rods the the aon's rods bed amen amen so you must put it in the compartment okay amen right I was here I was saying the Jews M at him because he said I am the bread that came from Heaven said oh is this not the son of he is Jesus is not this Jesus verse 42 vers2 this is Jesus Son of Joseph who father and mother we know now how come he says he's coming from Heaven all right because the person they can believe is from God is the one that they can see him coming down coming down and then stepping down also saw him we Are Witnesses one they can believe this because but the one who from Heaven superal he comes from into the he enters brother says Abraham saw Elohim when he stepped into flesh because Elohim was a hello of light so he followed the hello of light he saw it stepping into a amen then he knew that elim is here but he couldn't say that to to his neighbor he he couldn't convince somebody when Elohim is in his house and he eating are you referring to this man amen amen now when they look they see now the difference is Abraham saw the supernatural because before he stepped into the natural John saw the supernatural before he stepped into the natur you see amen that's how they knew him and John said I bear record this and his record he says the one who has sent me said to me the one I will see light abiding upon him that's him you see because the prophet tells you he he looks he looked ordinary like any other person now the people couldn't see God because he was in his human form form now they couldn't see God now even people today they cannot see God I will say to you you are blessed if you can see God in a okay I I will read you something here amen amen and somewh so blessed Peter says where where shall we go because the words of eternal life are rened so they see they saw a the man God uh the prophet says a mighty God unveil before us us this old script page 13 God back in the days of the Old Testament we find that after he had appeared to his people in different forms different forms he veiled himself behind old Badger skins hid him behind the Skins at his Mery seat then he says but by faith Israel knew that he was back there they knew he was there amen so he says which was a great secret to Israel for Israel to know that God is behind this bger skin it was a great secret amen amen so that's why they used to come there even today they come to the Wailing Hall go there and worship there because they believe that God wants dwell in the holy of holies in this Temple now they go to the ruins there and they worship there today the Jews amen amen and then you can't convince a Jew if you are a gentile no they are waiting for Moses and Elijah then they will convince them and the tribulation when the tribulation tribulation take place now he says H they believe that God was there behind the bger skin now you know in the Old Testament to enter behind that skin was death so they were supposed to worship this side of the skin knowing that God is on this side but to enter that side was then it says now to stay away from it is death today to enter into his glory was death now to stay away from his glory is death do you know his glory when he he prayed he said glorify me with the glory I had with you before the foundation of the world and again he said glorify them okay now we want to close but we are here now if talking about the sture of a man how God dwells there uh the stature of a man is in a threefold the body body spirit Spirit Soul so God dwells in a St of a man all right amen body body spirit Spirit soul the soul amen am now that's why the prophet says when he died Jesus he said father receive my spirit and the body was in the grave and the soul went to the lower parts of the earth you know they separated like that and on the day of the Resurrection the Spirit came and picked up the soul and picked up the body it's a threefold resurrection form amen amen the same with you your spirit will pick up your soul Souls that are in no no noen under the altar so the souls are there the spirit with God now the day of the Resurrection your spirit if then you are a dead that time then your soul is in the six Dimension and the spirit is in God God dwells in the seven diens so at the day of the Resurrection The comes that's why he says he who believes in me I shall resurrect him at the end of time that the spirit will come and pick up the soul that is the the six Dimension and together pick up the body and you come back again okay okay okay okay now I'm here God dwells in the St I can read to you that when the Samaritan woman she was waiting for the Messiah to come amen she went from this church to that church and uh the churches couldn't keep her he was a special believer [Music] oh [Music]
