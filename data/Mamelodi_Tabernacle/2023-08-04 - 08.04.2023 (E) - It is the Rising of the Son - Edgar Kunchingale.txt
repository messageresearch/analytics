Description:
Title: It is the rising of the son

This message was preached by Pastor Edgar Kunchingale on 08 April 2023(A) at Ubungo End Time Message Church in Tanzania.

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The Rising of the sun. The Pastor read John 14:20 “At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.”

The Pastor showed the audience that according to John 14:20, there are 3 Shareholders, Me in the Father, The father in me and You in me.

Moses as one of the shareholders wrote the book of Genesis, yet he was born after Abraham., but he was able to write this because he was there.

The Pastor took reference from the spoken word 65-0418M - "It Is The Rising Of The Sun"  38 And the first Light was ever given in the earth was God’s spoken Word. The first Light that ever struck the earth was God’s spoken Word. He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. That turned darkness into light, in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. Then, the Spirit of God, as It moved with love and compassion, at that great day, the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth; the sun rose and swept across, its rays, and dried up the waters from the earth, and made an atmosphere above. And, for its first time, it was to bring joy and...

Hallelujah God bless you amen Hallelujah I just visited a while unless I try to uh find my bearings here um God bless you my brother okay you're building from there okay God bless you at home there because Bible believers because we read the Bible too much amen everything is a Bible Bible say oh this is a Bible believers I mean it's not our name they just called us Hallelujah God bless you Pastor hija um I knew brother Pastor shija through pastankodima uh [Music] in 2014. so the organizers decided that Pastor shija should be in the same room with me so when we started discussing we almost spent the whole night discussing and actually we never disagreed Lena asked him a lot of people disagree with me but do you why are you not disagreeing with me no I need to come to your country you also need to come to my country so he has been he has even seen in my mother's cows see comes to her yeah yeah so he uh he went up to my mother's house amen that's how we have been as friends and that was all through the mamelodi church Hallelujah so that means now the mama of the fellowship now is uh blossoming to so many countries don't get disappointed that's me who is preaching but um [Music] um we have to take care of the vessel which we are using Hallelujah amen when you use your car you take it to The Filling Station to fill up so that's uh the ministry we are learning a lot I'm not ashamed to say I have learned a lot from pastor that is why I'm always close to him amen amen so uh it's the learning process so if you see me performing as an apprentice as an apprentice like if somebody who is a junior it's because I'm still learning so you need to be patient with me so that maybe you just pray for me amen so if somebody say ah he wants to preach like in kodima that's better because we didn't say I'm preaching like [Applause] that one would be an offense but the other one will be a comment very good comments I'll be very happy if you say that amen so let's stand uh we'll start from the same this which the past has been preaching from John 14 20. [Music] amen my brother one Chapter 14 verse 20. every day you shall know that I'm in my father and ye in me and I in you hallelujah amen you can pray for us um amen so you can visit it so uh we are talking about the family business amen amen family business is very complicated [Music] hallelujah hallelujah how many families here oh some of you don't have families I'll tell you what the family is all about it if you can come from a family as good as mine always complicated they are things which only kept for the family Hallelujah Hallelujah family business is very complicated amen amen amen I was talking uh I was talking with my brother for a long time no you can stand up uh this brother we were together in Primary School and we have been together in the message all the time we were not friends in school but the message of the hour has made us to be friends Hallelujah so when Pastor kodima said uh you cannot you're gonna see what you cannot confuse the family Hallelujah because family family I don't know here if you go to a Farming Gardens here when there's a dispute of a garden it's not for those who have come to marry in the family to discuss those are Outsiders it is only for the family to come and discuss [Music] they are the people who tell you this part here even if your mother has been here for 20 years it is for her sister [Music] now that her children have come back please because it's a family business so we see here about a family business there are three shareholders the father in not me Andy you in me anybody who is [Applause] these three who are the shareholders in this family business um if you run a company now company when it comes to the shareholders meeting they tell all the employees to go out looking because now it's a shareholder it's not for the workers even if you are working for the company for 20 years 40 years when they just declare shareholders meeting they want anyone who is not a shareholder to be out so we are here because we are shareholding inside there [Applause] we've got shares in the father through the Sun Hallelujah Hallelujah so when it comes to the shareholders they will tell you Moses came to tell us in the beginning God created Hallelujah that is Moses one of the shareholders Hallelujah amen amen Moses wrote the Book of Genesis yet Moses was born after Abraham but he was able to emotions he was there [Applause] then John oh remember let me ask let me go back a little bit the man who came to represent God [Music] because the way God's character is Moses [Music] so Moses could be speaking Swahili and somebody will be interpreting Swahili to the Swahili he was speaking Hebrew but they needed another Hebrew to interpret the Hebrew of Moses through the Hebrews [Applause] read the message books you find an and a white man speaking in white man's language but it has to be me and African to go and tell the white man what he meant if I go to America now I'll be telling them brother this year they cannot understand him so God speaks there a little but those who are in him they are able to connect all these these chairs inside there so when Moses said in the beginning was the uh God created in the beginning was the word he was not contravening Moses he was just telling us Moses [Music] thank you Moses John let's go to the third one three foot then come Branham says before the beginning [Applause] happened already happened already [Applause] they loved us inside God because you cannot be in the Rapture unless you were already inside [Applause] for example let's take the beginning the heavens and the Earth but our beginning came when God said let there be light amen go to Genesis 1 1 . foreign go ahead and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water not about that there was Darkness because it was the darkness which God didn't like amen so what did he do Hallelujah what happened first if you can go to the book it is a rising of the sun says actually the light which you see today it is actually the word of God which had manifested [Music] the scientist God can come now and say that's the sun it is this big it has got a nuclear fusion the professors are very bad at coming late they don't explain things which haven't happened professors who tell you things which have already happened you tell a professor that you know what there's an underworld he will protest but when it has already manifested it was like that after it has already happened they don't come before because before The Light Came we should have asked the professor how my brother or um it would be a frequency of this this until you don't even understand what they mean but when the sun came we never needed an explanation because we saw the sun [Applause] how many here went to school to know whether the son in a village [Applause] Hallelujah when the sun came even a building no there was a Sunday [Applause] so it was in the beginning but in the beginning uh Moses isn't it in the beginning the Lord created the world Hallelujah let's ask another shareholder what happened there come to Colossians 1. 12 to 16. giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partaken of the inheritance of the Saints in life did you hear that who has made us to be shareholders giving thanks unto the father we have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of our sins in life ah in the light we are shareholders in the light amen if you see the light there are my shares imagine you can say no because it's about you but for me I know Hallelujah yes my brother continue the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of History remember where the darkness is coming from that darkness is still here is so he has driven us from Darkness the original thought yes come on my brother he turned us into the kingdom of his dear son Amen in whom Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him Hallelujah who created [Music] who created this for by him when all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth disciple and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him amen and for him Hallelujah because if he was saying you hear that brother balam tells you yeah it was not what Moses said the Lord created but verbalam tells us it was it was the logos praying on the doorstep of the father creating everything Hallelujah inside the logos [Applause] [Music] I come back to my remembrance when I I was the Lord was created one brother uh the other person staying here just remembering I'm inside him I was there when the creation was happening amen Hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I was looking for a young man hmm my brother here if you see him come on this is a group of people just wait just wait inside him there's a village amen when he runs away from school the whole village [Applause] [Applause] there was all of us when Christ went to the cross I was there inside [Applause] when class defeated the devil I was there [Applause] do you think that I went to school to how to to to to defeat the Devil it's inside the meat I know [Applause] have you seen these young people who have come all the way from Zambia Zambia defeating the Devils regardless of how many women can undress for them they have made in their minds devil we know your tricks because we saw you there so the devil can't treat them you know our young people are having much victories because they're passing through the hardest times but I'm telling young people amen so now uh Moses Musa he said the Lord but if you go back to Genesis we will see the reason let's go back to Genesis let's go back there five two five billion yes and this is two five yes just wait for me a little bit with me yes yeah I want that one and every plant of the field before it was in the f and every half of the film before it grew for the Lord God has not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to tell the ground hallelujah hallelujah foreign but now there has to be a man two [Music] so uh no no don't don't demean a man you know if I was working in uh a in Boeing where they manufacture planes amen uh even if my work was just to clean the plane I'm a manufacturer I'm a manufacturer when I'm coming from home I tell people where do you work [Applause] princess [Applause] [Applause] so man here to take care of all the things which who had already been created but before they were created they were created for him the creation was for man Hallelujah so man came to do the work so that is why God took a backseat man was busy [Music] God says who was speaking Hallelujah so you can see these three four which the past has been talking about it's all over the Bible there is always a part for man to be there [Music] so the the world was lying in darkness the Lord said let there be light this uh that's a message uh it is rising of the Sun the first light of the date it is God's spoken words be careful of the spoken word the first light the light no is the word [Applause] so God cannot speak like the way I speak myself uh you know when I eat a lot of uh potatoes I start speaking things you know when you are too full you can tell your wife I will never eat again because you are too full but God like that there is a purpose wait until the purpose is fulfilled don't do things before you see the purpose of God [Applause] amen because the light came for a purpose [Music] so when the sun came spreading its lays inside the soil there was [Music] there was a seat when that light now hit that seed it starts to rejoice what happened to the seed when the light came to the seeds started rejoicing amen can I have some water amen no don't worry I'll do something just now um those who know Hallelujah um don't worry I've got something yeah if I put that one in that means I'm not stop speaking so just get um just get used to the speaking now so when the sun came the sun came when a light comes you know when the light came the birds start singing [Music] what happened to the father [Music] cockroached back into the darkness when a light comes [Applause] [Music] just go into your kitchen put on the light even baby cockroaches the way they will run away because in their company they told each other once you see life it's Danger [Applause] if you see the seals being revealed it is against their tradition [Music] they would want to remain in darkness all what they do is in darkness but when the sun came in [Applause] what a great hour when the word is preached it becomes a great hour Captain's son the light is in Jerusalem today is a good purpose the seed will rejoice the stone will complain you know when they see when the light comes the stones they become very hot water and they start cracking amen amen when the light comes manure becomes more rotten it is but when light comes they become much deadlier than before you see there the seed is rejoicing the stones are complaining the Pentecostals are becoming more rottenham that one the Pentecostal today they are more rotten than they were before but it is the rising of the Sun [Applause] the light which is foreign [Music] you are the light when you go to school there you live a clean life you rejoice because of the coming of the light because of the message the stones will complain but are the other people who seem for rotten because of you so the first light to come was to bring a message it brought motor life amen so uh let's touch science science because it has manifested isn't it let's touch science amen amen when the sun rose the trees grew on their own they were giving Foods on their own [Music] the people were eating for about maybe maybe thousands of years and some third years ago succumbed somebody to explain to us you know when the light comes the Crawfish and the other energy goes into the plant the plant goes the feeding pyramid foreign [Applause] what happened where are you coming from she just said you are Elijah Amen to say that there was a crowd which brought down the plane and the plane was down she didn't need that explanation foreign foreign [Music] because there will be friends out she just needed [Applause] if the Lord be with us come on come on where are his miracles [Applause] that was uh the Sun that was the sun we are recording one the sun you are yeah let's talk about the Sun there's the Sun so when the sun came no this is [Music] Darkness they fallacies they were thinking they were very intelligent you can laugh what they were discussing they were discussing my brother in heaven are we going to marry just imagine there were business discussing whether we were going to marry or not married not about eternal life when the sun came then the people knew that he had life and they cried who comes in the name of the Lord they became so Rose until they killed him you see when things are going on well look at the number of enemies which you have if you find that you've got too many friends just know you're not doing well [Applause] in Malawi Malawi you can have a wedding of your son people will not come on you can have this they will not come what but just died all of them are coming do you think they're coming to cry no they are coming to raise the flag what we have beaten I'm supposed to do yeah no come as if as if they are not concerned they're coming to make sure that it is so they killed him when he came back through his own power when he came out the sun lost amen [Applause] what happened to job Abraham Ibrahim Heroes foreign next they seem to grow [Music] so when there is a light you find that people who don't know how to who are even believers who become so ferocious against you yes because inside them there is no life because for the sea to grow it has to be geminized [Music] it has to be something add something inside [Music] to make it grow young sisters for you to wear a long dress there has to be something inside amen or else you are going to wrote more so the rising of the Sun this second son not the first son okay this second son has he brought us eternal life Hallelujah how many sons have risen how many sons have listened two yeah look at this this Genesis the sun in mark on Mark um my brother let's go to Mark Marco Mach 1 Mark 16 1 and 2. there's a Sunday Rising foreign [Music] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and stolen and had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the separaka at the rising of the Sun Hallelujah pastors which day was that one number what number did number one eight you remember the past was saying he rose on the day he didn't realize in the he didn't rise in the uh he lost foreign because the church has buried him [Applause] he was in darkness on the most holiest day of the Jews that's the day which was he was in total darkness [Music] their God is in darkness my brother be careful you might be religious but yet you are in darkness because you have resisted the light the light will give you A Way Forward [Applause] amen amen so the rising of the sun brought forth eternal life amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah amen the Sun lost again in 1963. [Applause] it is [Applause] what was the purpose of the Sun rising [Music] it was to put lights on the darkness [Music] what was the darkness theological Darkness [Applause] so the light has come that's paragraph 94. it is the rising of the Sun I wish they had projected therefore the sun came this light this one this light has come for the bride coming of Christ the bride coming out of the church [Music] the light has come to bring the bride out of the church [Applause] [Music] the light has come to get a bride out of the message people are killing each other too much in the message the darkness is back completely [Music] pastors bad mouthing another Pastor when they poop it completely bad to Darkness wake of a cockroach foreign [Music] [Applause] it will give life to those who want to grow it will make those who are not going to go to wrote more [Music] those those who take this right amen Hallelujah so the darkness is on us be careful don't run into the crevices stay in the light walk in their life him is the light and you become the light walking the light him is the light and you become the life I mean the sun has risen again amen amen amen hallelujah the son is here foreign and when he had opened the seventh still there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour Hallelujah this is Johnny Johnny he measured the time his eyes were taken out the time

[Music] hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen amen um I don't know about your presidency here but uh in Malawi there when the present is coming [Music] there's the President coming

people are very important to you you have suffered for them you have worked for them and he said I have preached as Paul preached he had amen amen hallelujah amen amen uh uh the message of the Hours come we are going back to Eden Hallelujah uh Eden and then was the whole place the headquarters of God but within the Indians of God God created the parts in the east for Adam here hallelujah Hallelujah you remember the way the first church was constructed the gate was in the east so when the priest is coming he comes from the East going all the way to the West through the present order Brazil into the holy place goes into the holy of worries if he was acceptable he'll come back with a message and deliver it in there is [Applause] to West West West West until when he hit the holy of holies he was brought back to the east and the message of uh standing in the gap ing he said I came back to the east to reveal the seals for God mm-hmm for God for for he was doing it for God you know who took the Israel out of Egypt was very missed Moses you're committing season how could Moses take them out of Egypt Egypt was a superpower do you think a man who says amen amen God came by the people who are seeing Moses [Applause] the mouth of Moses was the mouth of God they speak of Moses God's sick people and you'll find it says all the time [Music] whenever I come to the Israel why are you doing this yet I God I took you out of Egypt it is a Moses took you out of Egypt Hallelujah so they had to be a man you see there no no the sun is still Rising foreign for you to be here God sent a man for you to be here God sent a man to breastfeed you are here oh I'm going to heaven I'm a son of God you find that even the person which God did didn't believe the message of the hour but that was good who was breastfeeding you but he had to send somebody [Applause] because when he deals with men God sent man to deal with man foreign [Applause] for me to know the threefold purpose God sent
