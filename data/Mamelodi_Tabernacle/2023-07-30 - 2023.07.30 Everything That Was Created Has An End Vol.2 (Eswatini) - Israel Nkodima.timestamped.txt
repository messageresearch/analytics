[13:18] the message that we preached last
[13:22] weekend meet last Sunday
[13:31] yes last weekend
[13:34] I think you still remember the message
[13:37] last weekend yeah
[13:41] now the book says
[13:43] holy spirit of God Amen
[13:52] uh
[13:56] we're going to take it here
[14:00] as soon as we received the book
[14:04] amen amen I've been wondering at
[14:07] something
[14:12] I was talking about it even last night
[14:19] it's something that makes me wonder
[14:22] sometimes
[14:25] and ask myself what is happening really
[14:29] it
[14:34] is because of the the time that we are
[14:38] living in
[14:39] yeah
[14:42] something is happening that the people
[14:45] do not see
[14:49] and it is the last thing to happen to
[14:52] happen
[14:55] amen amen
[14:58] they will simply display it on the board
[15:01] here
[15:03] the quotation
[15:06] by quotations
[15:13] open for I will ask you to read out the
[15:17] quotation
[15:19] you remember that we used to we have
[15:24] used the same quotation last Sunday
[15:31] yeah you'll remember that everything
[15:33] that was created
[15:35] [Music]
[15:37] as an end
[15:41] foreign
[15:43] I was just supposed to say it but I want
[15:46] them to read it out of the book
[15:52] [Applause]
[15:54] creation
[15:56] in that
[15:58] God was not created
[16:03] so were we
[16:05] not Foods
[16:08] we were not created
[16:10] foreign
[16:12] [Applause]
[16:14] I think that's why we can read the Times
[16:18] that we are living in
[16:23] and we we can understand
[16:26] [Applause]
[16:29] there was something I wanted to
[16:32] understand
[16:35] because there's something that is
[16:37] happening and the people don't see it
[16:39] [Applause]
[16:42] amen there was a time
[16:46] when God showed us that there is this
[16:50] what we we called and underworld
[16:54] activities
[16:56] foreign
[17:02] and right now when we were in Congo that
[17:06] other week
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:14] um
[17:15] it was in the evening time
[17:19] when I received a phone call from South
[17:22] Africa here
[17:24] in South Africa as some other children
[17:27] were attacked foreign
[17:34] [Laughter]
[17:41] [Music]
[17:44] [Applause]
[17:48] the brother was was there was listening
[17:51] Brothers if you can't make it I will
[17:53] quote it don't worry
[17:57] amen amen and so on my brother my sister
[18:02] was just close to me
[18:05] when we battle uh those beasts
[18:10] [Music]
[18:10] [Applause]
[18:13] it happened one time when I was also in
[18:17] Malawi yeah
[18:20] I had to leave the pulpit yeah
[18:24] and go there into the office of the
[18:27] pasta then
[18:32] because there were some attacks here in
[18:36] South Africa
[18:37] [Applause]
[18:41] but then I'm glad that now I understand
[18:46] Singapore okay this morning
[18:50] we'll come back to that
[18:55] [Applause]
[18:59] because anything that had a beginning is
[19:05] a creation yes
[19:09] [Music]
[19:10] is this the thing the thing I mentioned
[19:23] that is just the part I wanted to read
[19:28] God bless you you can now relax
[19:31] foreign
[19:36] it says we are sealed
[19:40] until the day of redemption
[19:44] [Applause]
[19:48] means all the way
[19:52] we were sealed
[19:57] until the day of redemption
[20:01] meaning that Satan could do nothing to
[20:04] us
[20:07] until the day of redemption
[20:25] now it's referring to the seventh seal
[20:29] if you come back
[20:31] because as long as the seventh seal is
[20:34] not revealed
[20:37] um
[20:40] means
[20:44] and doing what he is doing
[20:50] is not revealed
[20:51] [Applause]
[20:53] but when the seal is revealed
[20:57] that's why the Bible says
[21:00] and when it was opened
[21:04] in heaven in heaven it was
[21:10] guava
[21:13] silence because it's a tool because
[21:17] it's a mystery
[21:20] now let's read it let's read here now
[21:24] last week we picked up this part here
[21:28] it says we are in him
[21:31] foreign
[21:39] and it says
[21:41] it's accumulating uh
[21:45] it is no more a way you know we we have
[21:49] gone through this last weekend
[21:51] [Applause]
[21:54] now now it's a really
[22:08] and I was reading this morning where the
[22:12] Bible says the bride and the spirit and
[22:15] the bread say come
[22:19] yeah um
[22:22] meaning that
[22:24] the spirit and the bright now
[22:28] are saying the same thing
[22:33] amen amen
[22:35] [Applause]
[22:42] over is seven Church age is over
[22:47] there
[22:50] will quote it
[22:52] [Music]
[22:54] that
[22:56] that future home of the bride and what's
[23:00] really bright and the bread amen
[23:06] now now
[23:09] and you I read also the book of The
[23:14] Rapture that's 20 chapter
[23:26] it says itsy
[23:32] speaks of the
[23:34] Rapture yeah
[23:35] [Applause]
[23:37] I don't want to say things without the
[23:40] reading out of the book
[23:44] but it tells us that
[23:47] is this is the last Church age
[23:54] this is the seventh Church age
[24:09] the other ages are
[24:12] yeah
[24:16] they are in the sixth Dimension she says
[24:21] they are waiting for those that are in
[24:25] that are coming from the seventh Church
[24:27] age

[24:39] rapture
[24:41] important
[24:43] amen God bless you
[24:47] all right
[24:48] now here we are
[24:52] the book of The Rapture page 20. in my
[24:56] feelings
[24:57] [Music]
[25:02] just like in the time of Enoch General
[25:09] enochino the Bible says the seventh man
[25:12] from Adam
[25:16] and we realized that brother brand name
[25:19] is the seventh angel messenger from Paul
[25:23] William
[25:28] [Applause]
[25:30] the seventh types this age
[26:01] [Applause]
[26:12] [Applause]
[26:27] [Applause]
[26:30] are in Alabama
[26:38] right here
[26:41] working with God
[26:44] before the Rapture
[26:47] these people actually are the word of
[26:49] God be made manifest
[26:51] [Applause]
[26:56] they are not in a church age now
[27:00] they are in him
[27:03] [Applause]
[27:07] he
[27:20] was in him
[27:22] is that enough
[27:26] yes
[27:28] the last days he has spent
[27:32] these last days
[27:36] he was
[27:38] working with God
[27:41] you know he was like on the runway
[27:47] just like a plane before it takes off
[27:54] you see it first on the runway
[27:57] [Music]
[27:59] and you can't stop it now the white
[28:03] people don't mind me because it is on
[28:06] the runway
[28:07] [Applause]
[28:09] now I see the people today
[28:13] the people living Satan cannot stop
[28:18] because they are on the runway
[28:21] [Applause]
[28:24] says
[28:26] potentially the Rapture is already in
[28:28] them
[28:29] [Applause]
[28:36] he that is out
[28:41] in my heart
[28:44] the time is over
[28:47] amen amen
[28:50] even if we can come into prayer line
[28:55] it doesn't work for salvation
[28:58] [Applause]
[29:00] because the pride is already on the
[29:03] runway
[29:07] you know when it is it is announced
[29:12] once it is
[29:22] it's all over even if you've got money
[29:25] you you can't buy you you can't book
[29:29] s
[29:32] it's on the runway
[29:35] now I have noticed that
[29:39] there are people even here on the runway
[29:45] no more turning back
[29:47] [Applause]
[29:48] they need they don't need salvation
[29:52] they are already in
[29:54] [Applause]
[29:57] they don't need to be prayed for about
[30:00] them
[30:01] for the Rapture
[30:04] potentially the Rapture is already in
[30:06] them
[30:07] [Applause]
[30:10] do you believe that
[30:13] we have them here right here
[30:17] the people that are going
[30:21] [Applause]
[30:23] and the one who is Left Behind
[30:28] there's no more Revival to come
[30:33] there's nothing that will come to revive
[30:36] [Applause]
[30:38] what was to be revived was revived
[30:50] the service
[30:52] close the service
[30:54] I read from this book here
[30:59] over a perfect man
[31:03] [Applause]
[31:05] is now suppose that is Page 14.
[31:11] the church
[31:13] is now supposed to be taking the place
[31:17] of Jesus Christ
[31:22] amen
[31:23] amen and you know if you
[31:25] if
[31:28] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[31:34] you understand it doesn't say Jesus
[31:38] [Applause]
[31:39] is the mystery of God revealed
[31:43] because Jesus is this Earthly name
[31:48] it says Christ
[31:52] stands for the anointing
[31:57] if they say you are Christ alike
[32:02] that means you are anointed
[32:06] but the anointing we are talking about
[32:11] was back there
[32:14] when as the prophet says
[32:18] the rainbows
[32:25] foreign
[32:36] but it was from the that Fountain
[32:39] of the rainbow
[32:45] the Fountain of Life
[32:49] the Fountain of Life
[32:52] now he say is it when you he was a
[32:56] rainbow yes
[32:58] you were in that rainbow
[33:01] [Applause]
[33:03] then when it was logos yes
[33:08] logos
[33:11] when he became men
[33:14] he made you a man
[33:18] now you you came through the systems of
[33:22] God
[33:24] then when he was a man
[33:28] yet he couldn't sing foreign
[33:37] he couldn't sin
[33:41] because
[33:43] in him
[33:46] was that rainbow
[33:48] [Applause]
[33:51] and now when he was here on Earth
[33:57] he came to manifesta
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:01] what he was
[34:03] [Music]
[34:05] and to indwell his people
[34:11] so he has indulged you
[34:15] that's why you can't sin
[34:21] amen amen uh
[34:25] those data ancestral
[34:28] ity
[34:29] [Music]
[34:32] they will remain ancestral
[34:34] [Laughter]
[34:38] and the end of it
[34:41] they will start flying with brooms and
[34:44] so forth
[34:47] they can't change themselves from being
[34:50] ancestral
[34:51] [Applause]
[34:54] but those that are Eternal remain
[35:00] eternal
[35:00] [Applause]
[35:02] they can't change themselves change
[35:05] themselves and become ancestral
[35:10] now I have watched these days

[40:26] after the seventh day of this past
[40:34] are we still waiting for the
[40:37] not
[40:38] ice no it has done passed
[40:42] and that's why he said to John
[40:49] [Applause]
[40:50] and I will show you things
[40:52] [Applause]
[40:54] that will come
[41:00] that is Revelation chapter 4.
[41:04] what did it say yeah
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:22] [Music]
[41:24] [Applause]
[41:25] and then
[41:27] [Applause]
[41:31] [Music]
[41:32] okay
[41:35] amen amen
[41:37] now
[41:39] that is after the seven Church ages
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:46] when John was summoned to come to come
[41:50] up from their seven churches
[41:57] meaning that
[41:59] if then we have passed the seventh day
[42:03] um
[42:07] God has someone us to come up
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:15] for we are beyond the ages
[42:35] pyramid
[42:38] sometimes says a mountain
[42:50] speaks of seven steps to God
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:57] that is the pyramid
[43:00] [Applause]
[43:01] that's why the church is likened unto
[43:04] the pyramid
[43:06] pyramid
[43:09] amen now this pyramidal church
[43:15] it shows that as we are looking to the
[43:18] change
[43:23] you can see where the church is
[43:29] amen
[43:31] right now
[43:33] that's why I said even in uh recently I
[43:38] think we were abroad
[43:44] in Tanzania
[43:46] I said a thing like
[43:50] we are not a church a message Church
[43:56] [Applause]
[44:00] you hear about the message churches
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:08] [Music]
[44:10] I only have heard about the bride of
[44:13] Christ
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:17] because once once becomes churches
[44:20] [Applause]
[44:22] then every church has a spirit
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:27] it becomes spirits
[44:29] [Applause]
[44:38] [Applause]
[44:40] that's why we are not churches
[44:43] we are the bread of Christ
[44:48] amen with one Spirit
[44:51] that's why the Bible says the spirit and
[44:55] the bride says
[44:57] amen
[45:06] [Laughter]
[45:15] exactly saying every time saying the
[45:18] same
[45:19] thing
[45:20] yeah
[45:25] the prophet don't say something and the
[45:27] bride something else
[45:29] [Applause]
[45:34] you watch the brother
[45:38] she will never say something contrary to
[45:41] the prophet are we also also aim for the
[45:44] company and she will never say something
[45:47] contrary to the wedding
[45:49] [Applause]
[45:51] that is the bride
[45:55] now
[46:04] if you've got eternal life I've gone
[46:07] through that
[46:09] I've gone through that
[46:11] the book of Ephesians speak of the
[46:14] fullness of time
[46:18] let's hear again when the fullness of
[46:21] time has come yeah
[46:25] what will happen
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:33] [Music]
[46:36] okay and when the fullness of time has
[46:40] come yes amen
[46:54] peace that one
[46:59] the future home of the Bride
[47:05] okay it says
[47:08] the fullness of time
[47:11] and when the fullness of time has come
[47:17] when is it that's when when we are
[47:20] beyond the seventh Church age that is
[47:23] the fullness of time
[47:28] because the seven churches speaks of
[47:31] time
[47:38] that's why it's said to John
[47:41] John come up
[47:58] [Applause]
[48:06] [Applause]
[48:16] seven days
[48:18] [Music]
[48:18] [Applause]
[48:21] which it doesn't represent eternity
[48:28] it tells us that
[48:31] we came through time
[48:35] and at the end of time
[48:39] [Applause]
[48:40] that's when we really see who you are
[48:46] at the end of time
[48:48] you know after the seven Church ages
[48:53] you can see the colors of all things
[48:57] you can see who you are
[49:00] the people you have known
[49:04] after the church is the seventh churches
[49:08] they are no longer the same as the way
[49:11] because
[49:13] [Applause]
[49:17] um the seventh has caused a huge
[49:20] separation
[49:25] people are separated while even coming
[49:28] together in to worship
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:47] oh okay
[49:49] now now let me read it here because it
[49:53] says here
[49:55] we are not praying for it
[49:58] but we have passed into
[50:01] eternity
[50:04] [Applause]
[50:05] amen I don't need to join a prayer line
[50:08] for eternity
[50:11] [Music]
[50:14] even if you are sick
[50:18] if you believe you have faith
[50:22] you will never come to the prayer line
[50:29] if you have faith in God
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:35] hallelujah did you read that book
[50:38] uh
[50:40] perfect Faith
[50:44] let me repeat you some something here
[50:47] again
[50:50] of God says
[50:52] if you have
[50:54] perfect Faith
[50:58] what do you want in the prayer line
[51:09] amen
[51:11] today what you see what they call
[51:14] revivals
[51:19] is just a bit of
[51:22] the word
[51:23] [Applause]
[51:24] they just say ah
[51:27] something about God
[51:30] then is prayer prayer like prayer line
[51:34] prayer life
[51:40] now I read
[51:43] the fullness of time
[51:45] when the fullness of time has come
[51:50] that's when time was being fulfilled
[51:53] yeah
[51:57] [Applause]
[52:07] I would find myself finding nothing
[52:13] because when their time is fulfilled
[52:17] [Music]
[52:18] when the time has been fulfilled it
[52:24] amen you'll find nothing
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:31] like God said that to the children of
[52:33] Israel
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:36] on the seventh day yes
[52:41] you will find nothing
[52:44] that means after the seventh day
[52:48] yeah
[52:49] you have went out
[52:51] for the day
[52:52] oh yeah
[52:56] beyond the seventh day it's
[52:58] [Applause]
[53:01] eternity
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:04] that's why now eternity is not something
[53:08] that you pray foreign
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:20] [Music]
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:29] as efficient
[53:32] so we were chosen where
[53:38] in him
[53:41] before the foundation of the world
[53:45] we were not chosen in the church
[53:50] we were chosen in him
[53:55] this is personal
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:30] to the religionists
[54:35] a religion is somebody who can talk
[54:38] about God
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:41] but yet he is not in him
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:45] because real Christianity
[54:50] that's when he is in you
[54:54] and you are in him
[54:59] you really don't talk about him
[55:03] he talks about himself
[55:08] when in you
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:32] the gospel we preach is from within
[55:37] lesson
[55:40] even this book tells you that
[55:44] the throne can only be seen from the
[55:48] inside
[55:53] amen
[55:54] [Music]
[55:55] so we are going to the throne
[56:06] Button
[56:08] as we are we were coming through the
[56:10] pyramids
[56:15] traveling Within
[56:18] then that's why he says
[56:21] you can see the throne from outside
[56:24] but
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:43] we who are in here
[56:47] in Christ
[56:50] in Christ
[56:53] baptized in him
[56:56] we are partakers of his glory
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:03] but not on the outside
[57:06] I know
[57:08] on the outside
[57:12] somebody on the outside
[57:16] is still looking and
[57:19] denying it I read
[57:23] so now we are invited in into him
[57:30] to be partakers
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:35] because you are a particular not in the
[57:38] classroom but in him
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:44] so that's why he says now we are invited
[57:48] into him
[57:52] you know
[57:54] you don't talk about the seventh seal
[57:56] the seventh seal
[57:59] now the people say the seventh seal is
[58:03] not revealed
[58:07] only an outsider can say that
[58:12] why because the books
[58:18] it is opened in a three-fold
[58:22] yes
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:28] what does that means
[58:32] now we can go back to it a bit
[58:38] the people don't do here with their ears
[58:42] but they really can grasp it spiritually
[58:50] what is the threefold
[58:56] you see because he said
[59:00] at that day you shall know
[59:04] that Lord
[59:07] I am
[59:11] I am
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:17] [Music]
[59:18] yeah you're talking about the threefold
[59:22] foreign quickly
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:36] Jesus said
[59:38] at that day
[59:41] I'm trying to
[59:44] put you on this plane
[59:49] uh it is he said it is not revealed to
[59:52] the public
[59:58] now
[1:00:01] a public
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:07] because it says
[1:00:09] it is revealed in a three-fold yes
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:24] Jesus said
[1:00:26] at that day
[1:00:30] then here it says this day
[1:00:38] meaning that
[1:00:39] he was referring to this day
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:47] when the Revelation is made known
[1:00:54] you will know
[1:00:57] the father
[1:01:00] you will know that
[1:01:03] and the father in me
[1:01:08] and the i in you now
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:15] right
[1:01:18] amen now you take it back
[1:01:21] [Applause]
[1:01:23] it was God
[1:01:26] the logos
[1:01:29] the men
[1:01:32] the men
[1:01:33] [Applause]
[1:01:35] God
[1:01:36] the logos
[1:01:39] the men
[1:01:42] now these three folded
[1:01:46] that's the one that will know about the
[1:01:49] seventh seal
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:05] is not the public
[1:02:08] foreign
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:33] Christ is the mystery of God rebelled
[1:02:40] at that day
[1:02:43] which day
[1:02:45] in this day
[1:02:48] I mean amen this was set many years ago
[1:02:54] now you know if the sins we don't count
[1:02:57] yes
[1:03:00] oh man
[1:03:04] [Applause]
[1:03:07] now that means at that day
[1:03:12] that means this day
[1:03:17] what is today
[1:03:19] foreign
[1:03:22] oh you don't know what is today
[1:03:26] okay but that is this day brother
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:34] poetry at that day
[1:03:38] and that's this day
[1:03:40] [Applause]
[1:03:43] he was referring to this day
[1:03:47] [Applause]
[1:03:50] since it is revealed
[1:03:53] it's all the way that day
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:04:00] then it continues
[1:04:03] when this Revelation is made known
[1:04:08] [Applause]
[1:04:12] made known by whom
[1:04:17] then you will know
[1:04:22] you listen to the language here yeah
[1:04:29] and that day you
[1:04:32] know
[1:04:33] when you you will know when
[1:04:38] working
[1:04:40] then it continues
[1:04:43] that I am in you
[1:04:46] meaning
[1:04:48] that
[1:04:50] when he is in you
[1:04:53] you know
[1:04:57] that something that something in me
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:07] oh my I think you understand it brother
[1:05:12] that day
[1:05:15] you shall know
[1:05:19] meaning that one more thing even now
[1:05:22] seated there
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:26] you know it
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:29] you know when he is in you
[1:05:36] but there's something mysterious
[1:05:39] some person don't know when he is not in
[1:05:42] him
[1:05:46] but if he is in you
[1:05:50] you know because
[1:05:53] Paul says nevertheless I live but not I
[1:05:58] probably
[1:06:02] living in me
[1:06:05] it's not of myself
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:08] then Paul knew that
[1:06:11] he was an apostle
[1:06:14] and he knew that there was somebody in
[1:06:16] him
[1:06:18] and that somebody was not tall
[1:06:22] but it was God himself
[1:06:26] in Paul
[1:06:28] then he knew it
[1:06:30] you know today
[1:06:33] whether he is in you or not
[1:06:36] alive
[1:06:38] amen because you should know whether he
[1:06:43] is in you
[1:06:44] or not
[1:06:48] but he said
[1:06:50] he said
[1:06:51] I think this is the day to know
[1:06:54] yeah
[1:06:54] [Applause]
[1:06:57] because if he is in you
[1:07:00] he doesn't change
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:05] you are a Christian yesterday
[1:07:09] today
[1:07:11] forever
[1:07:12] we are a Christian
[1:07:15] you know I always thank God
[1:07:19] that he is has made me
[1:07:23] to be him
[1:07:26] oh yeah
[1:07:28] amen that's why he took our part
[1:07:32] he wanted us not just to be worshipers
[1:07:39] he came in order to indwell us
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:46] because Christianity
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:49] not religion
[1:07:54] now that's why the message
[1:07:58] Christianity from religion
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] because Christianity
[1:08:07] it's not a religion
[1:08:11] religion is just a sound about God
[1:08:15] foreign
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:48] Paul says nevertheless I live
[1:08:54] [Applause]
[1:08:55] because he knew he knew himself when he
[1:09:00] was Paul
[1:09:03] and soul he was sold
[1:09:06] but now Paul knew that I'm no longer
[1:09:10] Soul
[1:09:11] there's somebody living in me
[1:09:15] and that one is not soul
[1:09:19] is Christ Living in me
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:24] okay at that day you shall know
[1:09:28] we are walking
[1:09:30] but the Wonder of it all here
[1:09:33] The Wonder of it all
[1:09:36] um
[1:09:40] that is this day
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:45] now we will close knowing that
[1:09:49] that day is is which day
[1:09:57] meaning there's no other day
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:02] when the book was opened
[1:10:05] not

[1:10:22] if not the holy ghosts
[1:10:28] for you are still
[1:10:31] until
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:10:41] you run short of money
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:47] no it doesn't say until maybe uh
[1:10:53] you are in trouble
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:59] um
[1:11:02] until you lack
[1:11:05] of normal
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:08] no
[1:11:10] until the day of redemption
[1:11:13] [Applause]
[1:11:19] the day of redemption
[1:11:25] is opened
[1:11:31] that is the day of
[1:11:35] LOL
[1:11:38] because
[1:11:40] your name was put in a book
[1:11:45] Emma
[1:11:49] young boy until the day of redemption
[1:11:54] [Applause]
[1:11:57] amen amen no
[1:12:00] we are waiting for the Redemption of our
[1:12:03] bodies
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:08] we are redeemed
[1:12:11] our souls redeemed already
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:15] but we are waiting for the Redemption of
[1:12:18] our body okay
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:27] you don't find your Redemption
[1:12:31] on a prayer line
[1:12:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:42] and when we were born Sinners
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:48] the book was there on the throne
[1:12:53] our names appeared on that book
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:12:59] amen amen
[1:13:01] the Lord Jesus
[1:13:05] that form of a man
[1:13:09] to come for Redemption
[1:13:14] to redeem us
[1:13:18] now that's why
[1:13:20] after he has done the work
[1:13:24] the book was opened
[1:13:29] he took the book
[1:13:32] because John John looked for one uh who
[1:13:37] was waiting to open the book
[1:13:43] now as long
[1:13:46] as the book is not opened
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:51] we were still
[1:13:54] waiting
[1:13:58] until
[1:13:59] day of redemption
[1:14:03] when the book was reopened
[1:14:09] now if you say I'm redeemed
[1:14:15] you are saying after the book was opened
[1:14:20] meaning you have seen your name there
[1:14:24] I
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:43] I I see this
[1:14:47] let me finish now
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:53] Jesus said at that day
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:56] that's this day
[1:14:59] this is Page Six Day Christ is the
[1:15:01] mystery of God revealed
[1:15:05] he says that's when this Revelation

[1:15:21] closing now listen to this
[1:15:26] I'm still here with this threefold so
[1:15:30] long
[1:15:33] it says
[1:15:35] it is not opened to the public
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:43] then who is the public
[1:15:47] believe it
[1:15:50] because it speaks of
[1:15:53] that it is open in a three-fold
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:02] and the prophet says
[1:16:05] the only way to know him
[1:16:11] you will receive
[1:16:14] this threefold Revelation
[1:16:20] three full Revelation
[1:16:23] what do you receive
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:26] is
[1:16:28] you are part of him yeah
[1:16:35] there's nothing he's before Sodom now
[1:16:42] he said shall I hide from Abraham the
[1:16:46] thing that I do means
[1:16:52] you couldn't hide
[1:16:57] because Abraham
[1:16:59] being part of him
