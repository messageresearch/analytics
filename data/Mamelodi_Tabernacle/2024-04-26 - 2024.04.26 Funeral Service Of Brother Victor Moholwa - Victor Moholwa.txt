Description:
Title: The preserved and registered names in heaven.
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Soshanguve on 25 April 2024

The elder read the following scriptures:

1 Corinthians 15: 45-51 | Luke 10: 20 | Ephesians 1: 17 | Matthew 25:10 &34 | Jude 1: 4 | John 17: 1 | John 8: 37 | Matthew 22: 41-46 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the names which are preserved and registered in heaven.

What we call death here on earth is just a departure of that person. The departure is that the soul took its direction, the spirit took its direction and the body. This flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven.

When Jesus came on earth it was not to show off himself, but it was to reveal the word. The word must be incarnated in the human being and it will give that person life.

You must have the knowledge of Him and there must be a spirit that should give you that knowledge. When a person departs we should not worry. You should know where you come from and where you are going. We are waiting for the rapture, and you know that you must have the rapturing faith.

The registered names were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and you cannot change that. You cannot make yourself holy, it is Him that predestinated you.

You have to overcome and not by yourself, but you were predestinated to overcome. 

If your name is registered and preserved in heaven you cannot miss the direction. My sheep hear my voice and they follow me.

Your kingdom was prepared for you before the foundation of the world.

When a person feels a physical pain we give them medication, but a spiritual pain needs a spiritual remedy. We go straight to the spirit and feed their soul with the word. 

When the word finds a place in the people it germinates and becomes Christ in you. There is a physical son of God and there's a supernatural son of God , which is the Logos. There is the natural son of God but the revelation of the word in you is supernatural son of God.

flower it stands up there beautiful and it serving a purpose serves it well and when the frost hits it in the fall of the year that's it young or old it dies that's death its little petals drop off and a little black seed drops out of it let's see whether God interested in what we are struggling for a little black seed drops out of it and after a while then it as strange as it seems God is so interested in that little life until he has a funeral procession for it it is the fall rains come great big tears drop down out of the skies and buries that little seed now is that true it sure is buries it under the ground Along Comes the winter freeze freezes over several inches under the ground the little Bub dries up freezes gone the petals drops off gone the leaves gone the little seat freezes bursts open the pulp runs out that poor little life that God made is it finished not by no means oh no see the solar system controls botani life the Sun the Su and just as soon as that warm sun moves from around behind the Earth and gets back around here there's a gem of Life somewhere in that that no scientist can find but that little flower lives again it served its purpose it lives again because it's life well if God made a way for the solar system to raise up again a life that saved him what about the s o n when he comes with eternal life and we have eternal life we're going to rise against some of this days let's just serve our purpose well what whatever we are let's serve let's serve it whatever Place God put you let's serve it for the Sun is going to rise one of these days with heing in his wings I want to come forth then in the brightness and Glory of his resurrection I want to walk arm in arm with each one of you up before his presence until then remember we the little leaf on the [Music] tree amen sister God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] m [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]

neighbors and their colleagues and the church may the Lord bless you brother mangu what time are we leaving this place 9 okay thanks God bless you okay can we just in respect rise again just read the scripture in the Book of John no let's start with First Corinthians sorry First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 51 1 Corinthians chter 15: 51 can you read it for us my brother English English or I'll read it in English then you'll interpret verse 51 of 1 Corinthians chapter 15 uh it says sorry behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and then let's just bow our heads Harvest can you lead us in prayer let us pray gracious Eternal Heavenly Father once again this moment we approach your throne of Mercy with Thanksgiving in our hearts Heavenly Father your word has been read heavenly father as we have even realized yesterday Lord Almighty that we need the spirit of wisdom that will come and give us the Revelation that will come and interpret this word for we know Lord Almighty that the leared people can be able to turn the pages of this book and read but Heavenly Father the same Bible is telling us that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life we are depending upon your spirit this morning to come and Quicken the word that has been read amen so that each and every one of us can find Comfort out of this word we commit our Elder the preacher of the word this morning that he will just be a vessel through which you speak to us and Heavenly Father we know that when you speak each and everyone will find his position in your word we just want to command the devil to step back and to go back to hell where he belongs because his place is not here amen Lord even if even as he doesn't have a place in your word so now we are gathered here around your word and we believe that it will just be a meeting between you and your bride this morning as we commit the service into your hands in Jesus name amen amen thank you you may be seated God bless okay like I said yesterday that yes we I think we all know brother Victor he was very notorious on the issue of the hatred Ministry of the underworld so most people hate that Ministry without understanding what's going on so brother Victor he understood it because his father went through those uh part of way of course there are families that want to help their families trying to assist them when they are in a situation only to find that they take them to the wrong people those people initiate them they'll be serving the kingdom of the devil unknowingly some of them and it becomes very difficult to retrieve him back that person and at times when you retrieve him back some people will criticize you and uh not understanding what is going on so we're living at that time but our brother we used to go together with him in trying to assist such may the Lord bless you so let's just uh have some few words of comfort to the family I also know the family may the Lord bless you right we just read the scripture here what is very important about this scripture it start by saying behold I show you a mystery now if you could look at it carefully it says s h e u i show you a mystery right amen uh we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed now this scripture doesn't say we shall all die no it says we shall not all sleep it doesn't say we shall not all die are we together so which means those that have departed they are asleep they are not dead they are asleep the prophet says when you are dead is when you are separated from God it's when you will never never be able to see God in your life you have crossed the line we are dead are we together amen now it says we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed that means there are those that will sleep there are those that will change like I said yesterday those that are asleep they've gone before us they are gone but they are asleep uh yesterday we read the Scripture it speaks about two bodies that scripture start by describing the Flesh of the birs and the Flesh of all the animals that are on the ground and the Flesh of all those that are in the sea then it speaks about the [Music] bodies there's a body that we are wearing it's called terrestrial body and when you get out of this body you put you on another body it's the Bible that says so which is the celestial body that is why the sist they could not believe in the resurrection when somebody depart he's not dead and we have dimensions and then these dimensions are in this way you being the body the spirit and the soul and then we have the two kingdoms the kingdom of the devil and the kingdom of God so it all depends on the kingdom that you were saving whil you were in this planet Earth and when you depart obviously you cannot go to God but everybody that departs even if he serves God but he does not go directly to God he's going to wait then he put a body where he'll be waiting in a different place you remember Abra I mean the the rich man and Lazarus I think the rich man's name was Divas they both died but they went into two different one went to Paradise the other one went to Ides see the one that was in Ides was in torment the one was in Paradise was in relaxation that is exactly what happens now those that were in Paradise when our Lord Jesus Christ died the book of Peter uh says I think it's chapter 3: 19 his soul our Lord's soul went to hies and then just to preach to those Souls that repented not and then from he went to paradise and took those Souls from Paradise because those Souls that were in Paradise were not washed by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ so it was just the blood of uh the ox and the so so they could not go under the altar but after his blood was shed then he went and took Abraham Isaac and Jacob andbody and removed them from Paradise and took them under the altar now coming to you and me you and me it all depends with which God are we serving everybody believe that he's serving God but believe me not everybody is serving God everybody says we are serving God we worship I've got my own church I attend every day or or every week but not everybody is H by God right now some people they serve God and ancestors now innocently they think they can serve God and the ancestors now let me explain that issue spiritually the Bible says when you depart your body goes to the Grave like our brother's body he goes to the grave but your spirit will go to God if you serve God and your soul it's either it will go to hell or it's going to wait for Resurrection let's repeat that when you die your body goes to the Grave your soul if you sered God it will be under the altar waiting for the resurrection not for judgment waiting for the resurrection now the soul of the one that was not serving God correctly it will be in Hell In torment waiting for the Judgment not the resurrection it won't resurrect and what about the spirit when you die your spirit goes back to God now if you didn't serve God your spirit cannot go to God now what what is happening it's meing so it's absorbed by it becomes a demonic Spirit that's the one that you serve now thinking that it's your ancestors a spirit wants a body where it could dwell in even the spirit of God wants a body where it could dwell in now it will look for the body in the family and then if there's one in the family that does not serve God then uses that body and then it comes to you and you see your grandfather or your grandmother or your aunt or your grandfather then you see me will come you will see him but it has come in the form of your relative because your relative did not serve God and then you will innocently think that is your ancestors right right now the Bible says here we shall not he says it's a mystery says I'm showing you a mystery we shall not all those that are sleep they are under the altar when the time come they will come and take their body or their spirit will come and take their souls Under The Altar and go into the body they will resurrect they will resurrect and after the resurrection then we will see them and after seeing them we will together with them the bodies will change that's what we call Rapture that's what we are waiting for now waiting for the changing of the body and the body will never change without the word that will cause the body to change now when you worship God you must be aware how you worship God you must worship god with the intention that you will receive a spirit that will bring about the changing of your body not any spirit that can change your body the spirit that can can change your body is the revealed we now when I'm speaking about the revealed we I'm speaking about the word of God but the word that is revealed now what is a revelation a revelation is an understanding and the knowledge but the spiritual one the knowledge and understanding of what you should how should you pray right now what is the relationship between you and God and how should you pray him and what God wants at this time now going to the service worshiping God it's a good thing but you must have a revelation [Applause] look uh the Pharisees the sagues the scribes those were pastors those were priests they were waiting for the Messiah and Messiah came which was our Lord Jesus Christ but they were worshiping they were high priest they were in the temple they were leaders but when the Messiah came they could not see the Messiah but they were church goers now you need to know where to because they missed the Messiah they even crucified the Messiah the very same people that we're having scribes are we together now even us in order that we should have eternal life we should know where and how to worship God the departure of a person is nothing all of us it's scriptural it's scriptural I've just read it we shall not all sleep which means some will sleep so now if one of your family members it's not unfortunate it's scriptural tomorrow I might sleep also the day will come you sleep at times I might not sleep I'll be around until my body changes are we together amen so then let's read the book of John Book of John chapter [Music] 6 uh before we go to Book of John chapter 6 while we still on that book of First Corinthians my brother we read verse 51 let's go back to the scripture we read yesterday uh verse 45 go verse 45 yes and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit okay fine amen now the Bible here says the first man Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam which is Jesus was made a quickening let's explain that uh in the Book of Genesis chapter 2ter 2 vers 7 ver it says God formed men after Out of the Dust of the Earth are we together and what did he do he breathed in his nostrils then Man became a living in other words it was a body that was made of the Dust of and then it became a living soul but the second Adam the Bible says he was made a quickening spirit how was he a quickening spirit if you go to the Book of Luke let's go to the Book of Luke chapter [Applause] one verse three Luke 1 am I right no no verse 35 verse 35 can you read it for us verse 35 it says and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of the shall be called The Son of God now the first man the first Adam was uh a quickening spirit a Living spirit was was was a living Soul sorry thank you the first Adam but coming to thank but coming to the second one the spirit of God overshadowed Mary and Mary received the word from from the angel of the [Applause] Lord and and then after receiving that word and then made believe that word and after believing that we and that we formed a child in the womb of Mary and with the first Adam it was a a a soul that was put in in in a in a in a body that was made out of a dust but the second one became a quickening spirit that's why I want us to read chapter 6 of John to to to to just explain these things you see if one of us depart like I said yesterday it's painful but it's not a natural pain are we together it is painful but it's not a natural pain it's like going to hell it's painful it's not a natural pain it's like the fire of God it's it's a very painful fire it's not like the fire that you at your home you see if you take your finger and put it in the fire you'll burn is very painful but the fire of God it's something else and the pain that you feel when you are injured or when you are sick the pain that is in your body it's not like the pain that that you see when you are in torment in heav when you are in torment it's a supernatural pain you cannot explain it to a a human being unless you go to torment itself are we together amen now we are here we are divided some believe in God some don't believe in God now those that don't that believe in God they believe in God by faith they've never seen God with their Naked Eyes they've never seen New Jerusalem with their with the faith that is in them that Faith it's a it's a they got it from God it's a blessing from God God revealed it but it doesn't show you a picture he gave you a supernatural strength which we call Faith that is why the Bible says without faith you can't please go faith is to believe on something that you don't see but you believe in you believe in it in such a way that you can even see it even if you don't see it are we together okay fine I said we should read uh John chapter 6 amen uh let's read verse let's start by reading verse 53 John 6 ver 53 53- 54 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except he eat the Flesh of the son of men and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day right now he says then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you we we we touched that yesterday but now uh when he speaks about eating the Flesh of a son of man he's speaking about the word of God now he says except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink the blood you have no life In You Now by that he means when you read the Bible the word of God we are eating because the Bible says in the in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word is God the word is God he that finds me so the word is God you are reading so I was saying to somebody I said you don't read a Bible like okay we just read it just for fun some other songs no there's no sense in that song there's no anointing you just say I'm just saying that amen so now there are some other people who will just read a Bible and when they read it it's a good book it's nice nice Jesus the and he raised Mary I mean he raised the Dead Lazarus so he's just reading that it becomes just a knowledge but the Bible should be read according to uh you know we are living at this time now it should be relevant with the time that you are living in if you read about the children of Israel crossing the Red River just reading is good but you have to read about the relevant thing and and even look at them and see them during the time of Jesus the relevancy was that the Messiah is here and some were waiting for them Messiah so they were irrelevant but they were doing a good thing waiting for the Messiah but they they were they were wrong Messiah was working are we together now when it says You must eat the Flesh of the son of it means it must be a relevant thing the scripture that will bring life into you and bring a change in your life when you read it you look and see when it says in such and such time this and this and this will happen you will see them happening now you are relevant with the scriptures you don't just read that's why now it says here you can never read and understand without the blood it says you you you you eat that you read and you drink I read you a scripture yesterday that now the blood types the spirit of [Applause] God that's the one that interprets it and when do you get the spirit of God it's a gift God gives you because you are predestinated God will give you are we together he will give you to that's God when we talking about the Holy Ghost you don't go you don't have to go to a mountain and go and pray there are people that will go around and pray a lot and say just find out the time that you living in and what does the scripture says about the time then all your problems will be so look even when you are sick if you get the right scriptures that that are relevant with your life you get you get healed I would say even if you touch the child of God who has the connection of God then you get healed because that is okay let me put it this way uh God lives in a man Elijah touched Elish he didn't say a thing just touched el el followed him you know that lady that woman that touched the seam of the Garment of just touched that and then there was a pool are we together and even if you fight against such a person you're fighting against God because God dwells in that man and God want to show himself but because he's a spirit now he dwells in a man and that man becomes God when you touch that man you are touching God are we together amen because the word of God is in that amen are we together amen now who so it verse 54 eateth My Flesh and drink my blood you know now what what is to eat flesh and you know what is to drink blood has eternal life that's what he says you eat the flesh you drink the blood but be careful how you eat that flesh it must be irrelevant with a event with a event it should be the right event and then you'll get the spirit of God but if it's not relevant then you when we speak about the Revelation the Revelation comes to you through the spirit of God [Music] that's why we call it the Holy Spirit now the holy spirit it's not to speak in tongues and roll around and do all those things no no the holy spirit is an explanation that God gives you and that explanation is known only by you when when we when we talk about the re Revelation it's your new name a revelation is your new name and when you have a revelation you know you have a look going to heaven you know if you don't go to heaven that when you look at yourself say I don't think I'll make it I need to make that thing that thing that thing but when you are ready you know what mean I'm going to heaven come with me I am to you know yourself and if you can't you know I must Rectify some are we together now that's what we call a revelation that's what we call your new name it's you alone that knows how are we together it is you don't go to heaven as a group or as a family or as a church no it's an individual we can be a church all of us but some might take a wrong direction are we together that's how it is so now let's go to the the book of uh uh John chapter 6 chapter 6 we we read did you read it verse 63 let's read verse 63 verse 63 says we on John 6 yes yes it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life yeah you see now Paul says here Paul it is the spirit that quickened 63 yes the spirit that Quicken it that's why we said the the second Adam was a quickening spirit right it is the spirit that quickened the flesh profited nothing you see that is why the flesh we take it back to where it comes [Music] from it profited but now he says the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the words that I speaking to you where are those words they are here they are written here the Lord himself they are life now they are life and then it says they are Spirit right now that we are on that one let's try to take the word and put it in a human [Applause] heart how do we put it in a human heart because the mystery of God is when God and man combine and be one thing that is Mystery now before there will be a creation to your heart there has to be a creator to create that creation there should be a new man that is created in your heart that is a a creation before there's that creation there should be a creator that will create that right now the prophet says uh he's speaking about the the little part that is in Your [Music] Heart Right it says God when he speak to you when he created Adam he was a body and there spirit and then a Man became a living soul the soul is in the heart of a human so he says there's a little part it's a compartment in a man's heart uh God has made it in your heart there compartment in your heart that was created by God yeah then he made that in there for himself each and every one of us there is a part in your heart which was created God by God when God want to speak to you he goes to that compartment he calls it his control room you have you have a control room in your heart when God wants to pick to you he speak because in your heart there's other doubt or faith the word of God you receive it by faith all of us when we receive the word of God our friends turn their back towards us because he say ah you are no more my friend because you don't drink you don't you don't SM smoke Ste and the family turn their back now I remember when I repented they said I must go to the Mountain School I said no I'm believe I'm not going there they said no now from now on we we won't have any negotiating with you even now by then I was a young man I think I was 30 years old I think I was 30 years old today I'm 77 years old not even a single one knows my house never came but I still preach this gospel and I'm happy in this are we together amen

the name of our Lord Jes amen amen so this is a a memorial service of our brother Mo of which we believe we all understand what is a memorial service it's just a service in moment in memory of uh the brother that has Departed and then we just come together and then read the word and remind each other and then we read the word that is relevant with what has happened so as to console the the the family and the church at L and those who were used to him okay let me start by saying yes uh was our friend as a Believer as for my myself I know him while he was still very young I used to pick him up section F take him to the service every until he got married and have children too but brother says he has been very courageous in fighting this demonic world is the first man that led the team uh to fight against these evil spirits he will take them to the rivers to cut off the connections those that have got connections to the Demonic world now he go to the place where they were initiated cut off that connection there was quite number of them amen and there's quite a number of people that were were helped you know all brothers and sisters from so we're going to read the word uh and here and say some few uh words concerning the scriptures that we have read I would like us to read from the book of First Corinthians 15 uh we'll start from verse 45 First Corinthians chapter 15 chter 15 starting from verse 45 vers 45 and then up to 51 51 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how B that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after what that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as it is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heaven now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a Myster we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed okay let's just power ahead we have our Elder B will just to pray for the reading of the word [Applause] as we bow our head gracious Eternal Heavenly Father the almighty God The Great I Am even tonight we are gathered for the memorial of our brother and our Elder that Mo and we believe that the word that has been read is read for a purpose to comfort the family to comfort all the Beloved for the Bible is the only book that has ever been written that can tell us about where we come from amen Lord where we are going where we are going to spend eternity our Elder is standing in front of us anointed of the Holy Ghost to speak to us Lord God Almighty it is our prayer that you anoint each and everyone that is in here for the Holy Ghost to flow and for all of us to hear the word we know the evil one always try to take chances there was a time when the prophet of God was preaching an unbeliever was sent to challenge the preacher with the intention to hypnotize him to make him back like a dog but the man of God CAU that spirit and even so where that Spirit was hanging amen and he announced it to the church the man was paralyzed and carried out that is a warning to those that cast spells while a man of God stand on the pull pit amen for this place is an anointed place is a holy place Satan we command you to live right now you stand no chance as we commit this service unto the hand of the Lord the Almighty God for we believe that the word that would proceed here shall not return unto us void but it will accomplish that which is will please God father God we commit everything unto thee in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen or you may be seated yeah we have read the word especially where the Bible says the first Adam was a it speak speak about the first Adam and the second Adam but before I go there I would like to compare what I've been reading what what we have read with Luke chapter 10 L chapter 10 we can start reading from verse 20 or can we can read only verse 20 and compare these two Luke 10 we read verse 20 not not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven yeah now what happened here our Lord Jesus Christ gave his disciples power to go and fight the evil spirits they did fight the evil spirit the the disciples did fight the evil spirit and defeated them and they came came back to him very happy so now he said to them uh not withstanding in this Rejoice Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven so my title will be uh uh the preserved and uh registered names in [Applause] heaven because here what he says he says your name are written in heaven now if the names are written in heaven then they are preserved in heaven and then they are registered in heaven so now death is nothing is nothing compared to that because once your name is preserved and is registered nobody can do any okay what we call death here on on this planet Earth it's just the departure of an individual is that we uh we had that ignorance we had that ignorance that when somebody has passed on we think that that somebody is dead but actually is not dead it's just a departure the soul took its own Direction the spirit took his own Direction and the body took its own direction we know very well that all of us are going to soal die but actually it's just a departure and the Bible says this Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God now the prophet says you know one day Pastor M said said why when we meet we've got when we have funerals why don't we preach like we preach every Sunday he says now if there is a funeral of the Catholics they do their Catholic thing if there's a funeral of the zc they will you with water you came to their but we message Believers we sort of uh back up okay fine so now I will preach the way I preach every Sunday now I will read a certain portion where the prophets says only those that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed right because the Bible says except a man be born again he will not enter into a kingdom now he says only those who are in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed when when Jesus Christ uh came here on Earth he was not coming to show off himself he was here to reveal the [Applause] word now the revelation of the word was that people must receive that weight and when they receive that weight they receive life because the Bible says who he who finds me find life now now what is happening is that now the word must be incarnated into a human being and then that word itself then gives that person life in in John 17 yeah remember here he says don't be happy because the demons runs away from you but what is important is that you must Rejoice because your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life After the resurrection he went up and then when he went up and then he sent the spirit down and then the spirit down he redeemed Us by that blood and the spirit remember one day he said he took a bread and gave his disciples at it this is my flesh and then took wine and gave them and say eat this is my blood drink this is my blood so they at his flesh and drank his blood but he never explain that now his flesh or bread it means the we the spirit means the blood I mean the the wine means the blood are we together so now he cleans his church by his blood now when he cleans his blood by his I mean his church by his blood the word that is preached it become too difficult for a human [Applause] mind it must go to a human heart and then should be a spirit that come and interpret that word like in the book of First Corinthians I mean first I mean Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 if you read verse 17 verse 17 yes verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of see the he must give unto you the spirit of [Applause] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him there's a spirit that will give you [Music] wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of him in other words you must have a knowledge of him but not through your mind there's a spirit that must give you that Revelation are we together now let's go back now we are talking about the preserved and registered names in heaven [Music] if somebody depart we don't have to worry that the only worry that can come is that we are used to him it it become difficult to accept his departure but as far as you know you need to know where you come from from and where you are and where you are going you don't just leave you always look back where you come from and then see where you are then if you compare from where you come from to where you are you will see that there's Grace God was mer to you because where you come from you didn't know him and where you are now you know him and then that gives you now the forecast you know exactly where you are going you are you are waiting for the Rapture and while you waiting for the repture you know that you need to have a rapturing faith right and you know how to have that rapturing Fai now when you look at back where you come from and and when you are here now you become very happy because you have the Revelation and there are people who doesn't see what you see haven't heard what we are hearing every Sunday are we together so now that is why he says now only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed right then in Revelation 20 I'll just quote these scriptures uh it says and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of [Applause] Fire now that that tells you about the future now you know where you are and the Bible tells you that whosoever was not found written in that book then will be cast into the Lake of Fire then you know that now if you are not if you read Ephesians 1 verse 4 you know that the pastor always read that he says according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should behold and Without Blame before him in love now now the preserved and registered names in heaven have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world you you won't change that it's it's a predestination it's according as he has chosen Us in in himself before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him now that thing you cannot make yourself holy it's him who has predestinated you now he has preserved and registered your name in heaven now now every Sunday the pastor reads this scripture in Revelation 2 revation 2 you know that verse 17 that he who overcomes now in other words you need to overcome then he said I will give him a hidden man not just an ordinary manner a hidden man now because you have preserved that man is preserved only for you and then you have to overcome not by yourself you are predestinated as an overcome right and then verse five he said having predestinated us unto the adoption of of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now let us understand that he says he do things he God do things according to his good pleasure [Applause] now he do things according his good pleasure and then what are those things he predestinated us now and he has chosen Us in himself now that is why now we worship God we worship God because he himself has called us you know the scripture he he he that he knew then he called them then he that has called them he predestinated them to a preserved life to a preserved and registered names in heaven the pastor taught us about the citizens of Heaven now the citizens of Heaven will start the citizenship here on Earth are we together Abraham started his citizenship here on Earth and the bride start his citizens her citizenship sh on Earth you remember about Revelation chapter 5 it says he took the book that is the book of redemption now that book of redemption our names are written in that book then if our names are WR in that what happened after he was through with his seven Church ages then he came down with the book and then he's calling people by the names that are written on that book are we together he has finished his job now he's he's having a book now he's calling people according to their preserved preserved and register names which are in heaven so now if your name is preserved and registered in heaven there's no way that you'll miss it you you won't miss a direction he said my sheep hear my voice and when they hear my voice what will they do they will follow me they will follow me so you follow him because you he his voice right let me give you another example there's a time where our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 25 he spoke about the wise and the foolish virgin you know about that but I'm going to read only two verses there in verse 10 chapter 25 2 it says it says and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the [Applause] reach and the doors were shut was shut you know about the 10 foolish virgin five were wise five were fish they they were waiting for uh the the the bridegroom then he says when the bridegroom comes those that don't have oil went to buy while they were out the bridegroom came that they were ready they went in with him in the marriage and the door was shut then shall the king say unto them in verse 34 on the right now is the judgment Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world you see I said my my my my title is the preserved and registered names in heaven now he will say come you blessed of my father now he says now inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for you [Applause] when from the foundation of the world now your kingdom was prepared for you before the foundation of the world and there's no way that you will miss the the citizenship of the are we together and in verse 411 and and he shall say unto them on the left hand depart from me you cast [Applause] into the Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels while we are worshiping we are aware that there are those that uh will take a different direction uh if you can read with me in in Jude in the book of of Jude read I'll read only uh verse four now you see you've got two types there are those that their uh names are not preserved in heaven and you say you hear what he says he says depart from me ye cast he says they Cur they are cast into Everlasting fire and the the other ones he said they are blessed of the father they inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for for from the foundation of the world right now if you go to Jude in verse 4 ver it says for there are certain men crept in an a who were before old ordained to this condemnation you hear what it says it says they are ordained for this condemnation now you can you you might ask me a question and saying okay what what has that to do with the funeral and what has it got to do with the memorial service now I said when we started here that a memorial service has to is to do to do with the Departed one now what we are reading here is what he used to hear now we are reading this in his memory because we used to Fellowship about these things he used to sit down and this things were were preached he knew that there is a bride and there is a church he knew that there is a a predestinated seat there is a cured people he knew that there are those who are ordained for condemnation there are those who are predestined inated for a life if you go to verse 6 it says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day are we still together what I'm trying to show you is that now you won't miss it if your name is preserved and if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life so when you depart we will have a natural H pain natural pain but the Comfort it should be the spiritual one I always say when somebody has lost the one that he he or she [Music] loved the only way of comforting that individual is to go to the Bible and and and check the promises of God but the natural part you can't you can't you can't uh what do we say if somebody feels the pain it's not the natural pain like somebody who is [Music] injured if somebody feels a natural pain you'll give him tablets or injection or you bandage but now the spiritual pain need a spiritual bondage and the spiritual bandage it's a supernatural you go right to where his soul is and feed that soul with the truth look youve got soul a body and Body Soul and Spirit once once the soul gets the truth and then that's the the the greatest bandage because that's where you are that's that's who you are are we together yeah because the prophet says the bride is himself revealed see so we're talking about those that took the wrong direction and those that took the right direction and then he says the rest was left for tribulation period whipping and wailing nation of and then he says that's the church not the bride let me tell you what's the difference between the church and our Lord Jesus Christ came there were Pharisees there were SES and there were there were scribes now the the SES did not believe in the res Resurrection no they they did not believe in the resurrection they say when you are dead we are dead you see and then do those Paul called them fools the scripture that we just read in in in in in in in uh First Corinthian Paul says when you when you plant a seed that se must die so that it could give life so says now you fools you don't have an understanding okay fine what he's trying to say is that now there should be a seed in you the seed which is the weed in you and that seed uh must spare of its own let me read it so that you could understand it uh let's read John 17 I mean John 17 yes John chapter 17 the difference uh uh between the the bride and the church okay chapter 17 verse one it these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee right now glorify he says now father the hour come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee now our Lord Jesus Christ was here on Earth so that the words that he speak should find the place you remember in John 8 verse 37 he says you say you are he says John 8:37 you don't have to read it uh he says you want to kill me but you say you are the Seed of Abraham okay say say you want to kill me and yet you say you are the feet of it is because my word could not find a place in your heart see now he he he was bringing the word to the people and once that word get a place in the heart of the people then that we germinate and then when it germinates it becomes Christ now the difference now between the church and the bride the church enjoy the weed are we together but that weed cannot germinate and bring the mean and germinate and be the owner because when the word germinate it makes Christ in you and when the word makes Christ in you then you become Christ you see amen now when when he says uh glorify me he was saying the words that I preached let it be manifested into the people so that when you speak about me he speaks about the word remember there is the physical Son of God which was Jesus and there is a supernatural Son of God which is logos logos is the Son of God Jesus is the son of God you this this is Harvest is a physical Son of God but the Revelation that is in him is also the Son of God are we together amen now Jesus wanted that now look look if as he continues verse two says as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal [Applause] life to as many as thou has given him so his waight when it reaches you then it the word comes from eternity in the beginning was the word the word was the word was with God the Word was God now when it comes to you it brings eternity it brings the Eternal beam and it forms the Eternal beam now it makes you the Eternal being not this flesh no it bring uh it goes to your heart and then when it gets into your heart that word itself like when when the prophet says the word is now in the bride it means then then that word which is in the bride makes that person an amature God amen are we together amen now if it makes you an amateur God then it gives you a revelation and then when it gives you a revelation says now H you'll know what to do with that Revelation now our Lord Jesus Christ wanted that people should know the word that is why if you go to uh to the day he was speaking to Peter he said to Peter H before I mean he started by saying to all who do people say that the son of man is you see he want just them to to to to to to have a revelation of who he was not not really Jesus but the word itself we together amen that's why he when he said thou are the Christ Christ and logos and the spirit it's one and the same thing Christ is logos logos is the pillar of fire logos is still the we so when he says Thou Art Christ then he was saying this was logos this was Pillar of Fire and then it was a revelation to Peter and then if if it was a revelation to Peter uh then is finished that's why he says now glorify me my last scripture my last scripture is here in the Book of Matthew uh Matthew chapter 22 from verse 41 he says while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David I'm sure you are aware that he says what think ye of Christ he doesn't say what think ye of Jesus says what think he of Christ now he was asking the Pharisees and then he said whose son was he is he and then they said is the son of David then he said unto them how then do David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord see thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foood sto if David then call him Lord how is he his son verse 46 and no man was able to answer him now this question is the very same question that he ask his disciples it's the very same question so now the consolation to the moas is that uh your your the things that we preach your father engaged them and when you engage them then that gives you a supernatural encouragement that there is a citizen of New Jerusalem if there's a citizen of New Jerusalem according to the predestination we will meet there and the Bible also says uh the all those that slept they will they will rise and then we will see them and then our bodies will change now this ministry that you are having the ministry of the revelation of the seventh seal which is the power of the third pool gives you uh it inspires you as his as his children that's where you get the the rapturing faith the Bible the Bible speaks about uh in Romans chapter 8 verse 19 speaks about the manifestations of the sons of God now the revelation of the seven SE shows the manifestations of the sons of God and then that is the consolation we we don't have to worry home is sweet home we are going home all of us if if he terries of which we know right now the time and the signs are telling everything is telling and the word also is telling there's nothing Beyond this there's nothing Beyond this ministry we cannot say awaiting another Revelation there's no other Revelation the Revelation is that of the seventh SE beyond that is a Rapture God bless you God bless [Music] you thank you uh I will call upon
