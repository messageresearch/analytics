Description:
Title: The Seven Seals Closes The New Testament
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 11 February 2024

The pastor reads the following scriptures:
Revelation 8:1 Ephesians 4:30
The day of redemption is the day the book was opened. When he died he sheds his own blood to redeem us. His blood became the word in us.
If you are in Christ you overcome the world and the things of the world. Those who are in him have eternal life. 
When you are born it is just to say hello and goodbye because you did not originate from this country. If you have the mind of Christ you know you are not here eternally.
You are here this morning because you were chosen in him before the foundation of world. God knew all of us before the foundation of world and knew about our choices. We were born to serve God according as he has chosen us.
When he opened the seventh seal it was all silence. And when he opened the sixth seal we saw Moses and Elijah, and they will reappear again.
When Jesus resurrected, the Graves opened and the dead came up. Those who were under the blood of goats and animals when Jesus died when he rose up he came with them.
But the blood of Jesus is the word. 
Under the New Testament he was a mediator but when the Seventh Seal is opened he is no longer a mediator. Now the pyramid is of the angels because the New Testament is closed by the seventh seal. 
When we are born we are born sinners. But when we are born again we are new creatures. He that is born of God can not commit sin and sin is unbelief. 
A man without God is a strange creature. After being created by God, he will then deny the Same God who created him. If you worship the dead it means that you do not know where you came from. To be ancestral is the spirit that denied God. 
After being raptured we will arrive in the heaven of heavens and traveling there will be like in a thought.
The pastor quotes from the following spoken word: 63-1110E He that is in you Par 24

been a while amen since I've had a mic in my hand I'm shaking as it is I had asked I see there's a scripture that I wanted to sh with the children of God it's about Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist [Music] him I was blessed that it did not end there but it says the angel rebuked Satan amen a few weeks ago we we sang a song that the Lord is coming all the time he's coming all the time so it really blessed my heart that even Joshua was standing there it says with filthy garments but God came through for him amen so we we know what we have done with our lives we went astray we know these things amen and he always comes to challenge to remind you that who are you who do you think you are to stand before sing but I thank God having listening to sometimes you need to pause and think about this great king of salale who came down as Our Redeemer amen our Kingsman to save us amen so from there I I felt the spirit of gratitude amen and this thought came to my mind that a worshiper is a Believer with a sense of appreciation amen a worshipper is a Believer with a sense of appreciation it's not what you have done but what God has done for us amen so I thought let me just worship God and appreciate him and say so I'm your lord so I'm [Music] yours so let your [Music] M has follow me so let you found me King Jesus

careful on what you are doing and a woman choosing a husband acting the choice of husband be really careful what she is doing especially in these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a

amen so for this morning let us now read his word but we're going to take this part here it will take us about 30 minutes I want to turn to this scripture Revelation 8 verse one verse one amen the reason we read this scripture I will tell you the reason now let's bow our heads before he speaks to us where's the elders Elder you got a book in your hand can you just say a prayer after before we read the word amen amen Ed say Elder God bless you yes sir amen gracious Heavenly Father the god of Our Father Abraham of which we are his seed Lord we just want to thank you Father this is the word that Lord you allow us to bypass our theop to come father and be born father in sin and be tested so that my father you had a good plan to redeem us back to you and father the way you have redeemed us is through your blood and is through your word this is the word this morning Father we pray for our dear pastor we pray for this word that we have prepared father for your bride one day the prophet said let me decrease so that he can increase but father that was the wedding father because you didn't want your son to stay without a wife amen so father we like to thank you Lord that today there is a wife and the way the father makes your word father to your wife to increase thank you Heavenly Father that you are going to increase even more to this word as we pray and the devil doesn't have any power nor authority over this word we cast him out as the pastor is standing as an angel that my father your word will come forth and it will accomplish what father it has been planned thank you heavenly father bless each and every soul and bless this word and bless our pastor in the name of Jesus amen amen okay brother amen Revelation 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen you may be seated okay amen now I promised you you know in the book we realized that uh when he opened the sixth s uh we see mes and elah amen when he opened the six and very soon according to the Elijah will appear on M Transfiguration you can see what is happening today and uh those who were there before the foundation of the world maybe one can say let me answer you with Ephesians chapter 4 there amen we talking into the perfect now a perfect man is a man who has eternal life and a man who has eternal life didn't appear when he was born he was there before in the mind of God amen for what did it say Ephesians 1 verse 4 according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world do we start it there or where yes yes chapter 1 verse4 apply the first GE from verse one Paul Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus grieve not oh sorry gri chter 4: 13 amen grieve not amen the holy spirit amen and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby he are sealed unto the day of redemption amen right amen said unto the day of redemption you know when I read here it tells me that the day of redemption is the day the book was open because if you are redeemed your name is in the Book of Life or the Lamb's Book of Life two types here we have the Book of Life the L book of life now the Bible clearly shows that those in the Book of Life on the day of judgment they will come through judgment SE and they will be saved according to their good works but those in the Lamb's Book of Life have already passed from judgment God has already judged them and they were found to be righteous you know when he died uh he shed his own blood because no other [Music] blood we are all sinners don't be deceived we were all born Sinners and we are all being called since I cannot uh get rid of my sins that's why he came to shed his own blood amen amen and then it says when he shed his blood his blood became his word in me and you without him you are not the day is coming in very near when all shall stand before him be it a king or whoever will all stand before him and the Bible says the books will be open amen amen and those whose name were found in the in the Book of Life they shall come through the judgment to be judged according to their words but those in the L's Book of Life he has judged already and they were found to be without any sin amen amen amen amen because he was found without any sin now Redemption that's why the word Redemption speaks of something to redeem it is to take it to its original if you are in him it says according as he has chosen us when before the foundation amen amen the world that's why if you are in Christ you overcome the world and the things of the world because things of the world they come and go but those who are in him have eternal life eternal life is a life that will never end well life come into pass you have life here on Earth we shall pass away amen amen that's why when I was born H the parents considered Insurance burial insurance they know that I am born in order to they know that I'm passing on when a child is born the parents know that they start to prepare for the child's death you all know amen amen because what they expect is that we are B he is born to die because that is part of the Earth all right amen that's why when a child is born the family starts to think about the future of the child some Slaughter GH and so for and but in Christ Jesus we don't need a go because we are passing on when you are born and you are predestinated you are chosen in him before the foundation of the world when you are born is just to say hello and [Applause] goodbye amen amen because you you did not originate from this country here you are a so amen amen and uh sometimes now if you are you have the mind of Christ you know that you are not here eternally now I can prove to you that when a child is born they come with predictions like this s we have said seen this before I I have learned something from the not only whites but from some parents when a child is born you know some somay come with predictions but in this manner I want this child to be like his uncle and become a a a a a medical doctor but the others they don't do it that way I was taught that they purchase some dolls and what what what you know what do you call them toys toy then like they take this choice and spread them before they are children and sit back now each and every child will show a sign that's in her you watch him playing he going to make a choice out of this Choice he will start to place use maybe use the the doctor's type of then the parents will look at you to see that this child every morning he his kind of Joy playing and all is with the doctors amen amen then they study them and they see this one loves C loves this when they grow up now they have already seen what's in this children it's a thing of saying I want him to be like his brother I want to like it must come out of the chur they must see it in him then they know that uh when they take the child to school they have already seen what is in the church amen un like us that thing is not in him or in they push him to school then he will struggle that was not in him that's why Christianity saw as he says as we were chosen in him you are in him this morning because you are chosen in him amen amen before the foundation of the world God knew all of us here and he knew that this one would go that way that way before the foundation of the world the almighty God knew that you would be here this morning and he knew about your choice amen amen that's why to be redeemed is to be taken back all right amen now we were born sinners but after that the Redemption CA Redemption took its cause you were born to serve God Amen not like your uncle but as it was written he has chosen you before the foundation of the world amen amen amen the parents have seen the knowledge that is in you before they took you to school they check first what is in you all right amen you know I was reading about the seventh SE when he open that se when he open it not when he preach it and it was all silent okay amen because you look at things in this way when he opened the six seal what did we see Moses and Elijah that's when he opened the six and to prove to you that we saw Moses and Elijah it is because they will reappear in they theop on the mountain there and the time is drawing towards that you know last we were reading in the days of the Lord said of the end time they ask him about the sign the AM mean am then he said as it was in the days of Lord and in the days of all right amen actually my message today was supposed to be H that little that stone in the pyramid the white stone amen all right amen but now we have some activities we'll come back with that that white stone is very very it is closing this [Music] age I I we are coming with that I was just reading this part even this morning it says uh the message of the Seven Seals in their closing that's the the message of the entire Bible all right amen do you believe the Bible okay amen we spoke to I think some students it was not at the school they were asking [Music] about ancestors ANC ANC yes I was with the brothers they will remember now I said what is this body now what is this ancestors who has created the Earth is it is it an all right then you know what happened when Jesus died the Bible says the graves when he resurrected the graves what happened to the graves open they open because he came the first sign he gave when he died the graves were open and the dead came out now he came with them because the Bible says H when he died his Spirit you know man is a soul and what his soul went down when he died and he came back time won't allow me to say but on the resurrection day he came back with those who died before and they died in the Lord so they were under because before they were under the the blood of goat but when Jesus died and shed his blood they rose up amen amen amen and they were no long under those priest where the blood of go would be HED yeah sacrif sacrificed his own son because the blood of ghost could not redeem us amen the blood of a goat they just make you be all the time the blood of Jesus is life amen that life is the way when he got to Mary Gabriel Gabriel when he spoke to Mary and Mary according to the word of the Prophet the angel Gabriel he accepted the word of God that came amen through that angel that's why we you will see next time we touch this white stone that the ministry comes through the prophet and at the end of it we see the the very same seventh angel messenger introduced the seventh angel so we follow this things from an angel in the Earthly body now we see Angel amen amen because you pass from this unto this amen all right amen there you listen the message message of the Seven Seals in their closing that's the message of the entire Bible the Seven Seals closes the New Testament that's why under the new Testament he was AI a mediator but when the seven seal was opened it says he is no longer a mediator that's why if he is no longer a mediator he was a mediator at the altar we supposed to he was supposed to forgive us us but after that he's no longer immediate that's why you see things happening the way they is no longer immediate amen all right amen he was a mediator now uh in the time like this when he is no longer immediat you come to him amen amen because we came under the shed blood why we see these things now when the the the the the New Testament is sealed up closed that was the blood when it is closed they predestinated they go forth then that's why the pyramid is now of the Angels because the the the Old Testament I mean the new test is closed closed by the seven SE amen amen amen now something else is open up you know God said to that was John is he the one yes he someone to come up after the seven Church churches which was the New Testament the New Testament now after the seven churches what is it now it's another ministry that's why we differ so much but I don't mean we differ we we have promoted differences no no no no each and every one of us has a certain nature if it is not the nature of God then is the nature of the evil one you can have two Natures when we are born we born Sinners be it a king or what but when we are born again amen amen the Bible says we are now we are at a new creation amen born again and the Bible say he that is born of God how many were born of God if he that is born of God sin is not sin is unbelief if you don't believe God then who has created you amen amen I'm closing so that's why the word said repent all of you Peter stood up and said therefore repent and do what and be baptized then you shall receive you get amen you won't receive it if you don't repent Man Without God is a very strange creature after being created by God he denies God that is something very strange even an animal after it is born it SWS the mother it has a revelation that I came from this one it starts to follow the M you look at chickens after their mother even an animal knows that I'm I came from this one but men don't know where he if you worship the dead that means you don't know where you came [Music] from to be ancestral is a spirit that rejected God hallelujah amen amen am but the real spirit of God tell you that I've seen animals been born the first thing it start to stand up it looks for mother because that where it came from amen amen amen originally everything is from God and God brings it down to the Earth like they say you should respect your mama because she was the first person to welcome you when you come into the world that was who was that [Music] you'll hear them saying the day you were born your father was on his way to watch K Chiefs play he just received a sale to say m she's the first one to welcome you that's why you have Mother's Day and I see Mother's Day is more popular than Father's Day amen okay closing here that it is if we can respect ourly mly father and what about God the Creator who loved you so much when you are in sin defeated amen amen he came and took your own form and walk this world and as a king man that's why they call him the kingsman Redeemer who came even now you are here but yet but I let me point to myself while I'm standing here in a suit there's a coffin for me but it's not for me for my [Music] body there's no cofin for your it's for this body because some people they say it in this way that you are born to die that's why I'm losing that's why when you are born uh people people they differ in some things when one is born they come together the parents and so because they fear there's so much fear in this world that you'll find even a newborn baby already with some strings and arm do some ancest can a dead person help tell me that's why the world is like this the children are born KN not who created them all right let's look at this there's fear here that's why when we buy a car what comes in there insurance insurance insurance what else amen and yourself showing that you are born in a world that is not safe now the Rapture is coming after we have being ruptured we will arrive in that amen Heaven of Heavens that you don't need sexual I love the prophet when he says even traveling there you will travel like in your thought because in your thought you don't know where I come from but as I'm standing here I I

time men can promise you something and tomorrow because you even forget I'm not buy I'm not buying that that is man but now with God it comes by predestination he has already done he came only to apply [Music] he said I knew you when before you were in your mother's wom amen amen God didn't wait for your birth knew you before mother that's why those who were in him their nature is Tove him because they [Music] were if a chicken a chicken lay eggs that is something else now each and every ch in this eggs when they they won't go that way they know where they came from now as we are
