Um my brother will read the scripture for me. Mark chapter 10 from verse 13- 16. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. If it pleased Jesus when they brought children unto him, what about me? Then also I will be pleased when this they bring the children because I believe they believe that they are bringing their children to him not to brother but to Christ with with you believing that then God will work then he will bless these children. You see these hands these hands born of a woman. But Jesus has chosen to use these hands to bless these children today. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you my sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Is it a boy or a girl? &gt;&gt; A girl. What is the name? &gt;&gt; Let's lose our eyes.

I've taken the child into my hand. &gt;&gt; I believe you are using this hand of mine. &gt;&gt; Then I bless this child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. A baby boy or a girl? A boy. [snorts] I believe he will be a preacher. I believe he will be a preacher. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh let us I'm holding a boy in my hand here. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. De Father, &gt;&gt; in this world of many spirits, spirits going around, especially seeking children to indwell them. father, the mother has decided to bring your child to you so that you can protect him from all demons.

[applause] When we sing, &gt;&gt; we sing because we know in which age we are living in. And we know that spirit of Elijah because the spirit of Elijah is the spirit of Christ. And if the spirit of Christ was with Elijah, it is still together here. When we say welcome, welcome Holy Spirit. We know who we are welcoming. We are not welcoming a person per se. We know who we are welcoming. If I start to talk my own things, then it's no more Christ. Christ because we know who we are believing. &gt;&gt; This church has grown enough has grown enough in the shoes I'm standing in here. They are too big for me. I can't even try to fit into them. But we we pray God that if he brings another one, it must be the same spirit. [applause] That is why you are praying day and night. We don't we don't want another. We want him. Praise God. &gt;&gt; While standing here, &gt;&gt; you know I'm pastor. &gt;&gt; I'm a pastor at Lu. This is a church is sovereign. But they have asked me that I must help you. I believe you are happy about that. God bless you. God bless you children of God. While standing on our feet, &gt;&gt; let's open the book of Genesis 1 to4 [music] &gt;&gt; verse 1 to 4. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 4. Then we read and then we shall read 9-4. Then we shall read Luke 17:30. as my brother. &gt;&gt; Genesis 18 from verse 1 to4. And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mammor. And he said in the 10 door in the heat of the day, and he lift up his eyes and looked &gt;&gt; and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself towards the ground, and said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourself under the tree." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 9. And they said unto him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah had it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am works old, shall I have pleasure, my lord, being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah love, saying, Shall I of shortity bear a child which old? Is anything too hard for the Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. Luke 17:30. Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Let's close with our eyes. My father, our father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come to we approach thy presence. We know we are not worthy but you have made us worthy through your blood, through your message of the hour. standing here. I am appealing and beseing you to come and use my voice and I brother's voice to convey &gt;&gt; what you want your children to know &gt;&gt; not what I want them to know. &gt;&gt; I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may take our seats. God bless you. Um my topic is &gt;&gt; it's like this &gt;&gt; the end time sign. The last sign. &gt;&gt; The last sign. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see we as the bride we I don't know whether I skip something here. &gt;&gt; Where are those couples I married yesterday? Oh, &gt;&gt; are they here? &gt;&gt; Let them come. I don't want to skip that. &gt;&gt; If they're here, you can just ah they're coming. [cheering] [applause] I felt I've scared something when I want to go on. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. You can look forward look forward. Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; the church of the living God, &gt;&gt; the royal seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; humbly in front of you in this land of fatherhood and motherhood, I'm introducing the New families. [applause] This is Sigala family. [applause] They have joined us in this journey and they are prepared to walk with us. You may take your seat, brother. Let me let me greet you first. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you, my sister. You may take your &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your [music] [applause] forgive me elders. Forgive me. I nearly forget to do that. But something said no, &gt;&gt; don't go out. &gt;&gt; Um in the Asia living people are trying to imagine what should happen. They try to manufacture things. so that they can be sure that they are Christians to make sure that they are the bride of Jesus Christ. But you see the ship to produce wool it you cannot you cannot try to force it. The sheep &gt;&gt; must just eat the grass and drink water. But when the sheep is eating grass and drinking water, it is not being that because it wants the the wool to come out. It is life. But when it is doing that, the wool comes up. And when the wool comes out, it benefits the farmer. And the farmer will take the wood from the sheep. And the sheep something is taken from the sheep. belongs to the sheep to help others. Just like a Christian, &gt;&gt; we cannot manufacture something to show that you are a Christian. We cannot say do this, do that. If you don't do this, then you are not a Christian. A Christian &gt;&gt; is a Christian &gt;&gt; inside. He she or he is living that life because is his is not trying to impress somebody. No, no, no. Uhuh. Whether somebody is impressed or not is is his or her life. You see, you hear people, they say, "I want you to preach the seventh seal." I want you, you must preach the seven. They don't know what the seven seal is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; let me just read what the the prophet says. &gt;&gt; He says, Christ is the seals those who are revealed. He is those seals. The revealing of the seals. It was revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go step by step, showing you something where we are and what is happening in this dispensation. Amen. Because we must know where we are. The Bible where I have read it speaks about God appearing to Abraham and Abraham &gt;&gt; knew that it was God. The prophet says, "Abraham saw three bowls of water, three balls of fire, coming down, but immediately there was two men coming, three men coming." And he said it was Elohim who said he said he made another body for himself. Amen. Then he made another body for that angel and another body for that angel. And they went to Abraham. And Abraham could know that God has visited me. Then when he has visited Abraham &gt;&gt; and this same God who visited Abraham here, &gt;&gt; Abraham met him when he was from the battle of the kings. Do you believe that Abraham met the same God? &gt;&gt; But he was in a Theophony and he was called Melkisedc. But it is the same God. Are you together with me? Here he was in flesh. But there he was in a Theophony and was called Mechisedc. In other words, this one here &gt;&gt; is MelkiseDC &gt;&gt; but in flesh the people sometimes they know who Melised is. They don't know who Melised is. Then when Abraham met Melkisedc and the prophet says we will also because Abraham met him &gt;&gt; between the battlefield between a battlefield and Abraham's home in the middle there Abraham met he said it it shows that we shall meet our between our home and his home between the battlefield and our home. Are you together with me? Amen. You see um we can say potentially because we are after &gt;&gt; the battle. We are beyond that if because we are beyond that we have to meet but we must know who is Abraham met him there and he met him here. Are you together with me? Do you believe this man was meedced? All right. &gt;&gt; If you believe that then we shall go on. &gt;&gt; This manc made a sign. &gt;&gt; That sign was a prophetic sign, a discernment sign. He said, "Your wife by the life, by the time of life, I will come. He will be having a son left behind. He could discern what was in S. He was doing the sign, a prophetic sign. And that sign was the sign of the son of man. Hey, are you together with us? Ah, don't worry. But that one &gt;&gt; it was a prophetic sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when that &gt;&gt; Melkisedc came and was put on flesh, &gt;&gt; he was called &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together? &gt;&gt; It was the same. But now he was made flesh. That's why he refused to be called the son of Mary. He said to you woman, he didn't say my mother &gt;&gt; because it was that me in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he came, &gt;&gt; he came as the fulfillment &gt;&gt; of Moses prophecy &gt;&gt; that God will send you a prophet like an unto me. And when they recognized him, they recognized him as a prophet, &gt;&gt; the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together? &gt;&gt; He was recognized by the Jews &gt;&gt; and the Samaritans. not the Gentiles because he was not sent to them. &gt;&gt; They were not they were not expecting the Messiah. &gt;&gt; They will not be the son of man. But the Jews and the Gentiles were expecting the coming of the son of man. That's why when they recognize him, they recognize him by the sign of prophetic sign of discernment. He said to Nathaniel, "Before Philip called you, I saw you. What is that?" That is discernment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're not there, you will come. &gt;&gt; It was Nathaniel &gt;&gt; called by Philip &gt;&gt; and they were Jews. Then he went to Samaritan in the well there when he met that Samaritan woman. When he start to tell her woman, you have six, you have five men. The the one you have now, which is the sixth one, is not yours. What sign was that? &gt;&gt; Discernment. &gt;&gt; A prophetic signet. &gt;&gt; The sign of the son of man. This woman said, &gt;&gt; "I perceive &gt;&gt; thou art the prophet." &gt;&gt; He was the son of man. Son of man, the prophet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then he he promised in Luke 17:30, &gt;&gt; more Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; I'll skip some of the quotes here. you you know them. I will skip them. But what I'm talking is what the prophet said. If you want it, I will tell you. But now according to Luke 17:8, Luke 17:8 and other scriptures, he must reveal himself to the Gentiles. as a son of man, &gt;&gt; the prophet. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; He must reveal himself to the Gentiles as the son of man, the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must know when he revealed himself to Abraham there Because the prophet said he must reveal himself to the gentile just like he revealed himself to Abraham. Amen. Because Abraham was waiting for the promised son and we gentile we are waiting for our promised son. Our promised son is the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are we're going to be born. &gt;&gt; We're going to be born. Amen. Oh, &gt;&gt; my son is doubting what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be born because we're going to come out of this thing and get another body born out of this one. This is a imperfect body before Abraham Abraham &gt;&gt; received that promise. There came the confirmation. &gt;&gt; Confirmation was brought by Elohim when he showed them &gt;&gt; a prophetic signet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Then after that, that was the last sign which Abraham and Sarah had before they received their promised son. They had that sign. Which sign? &gt;&gt; The sign of discernment. Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophetic sign. And after that sign, it was the last sign. After that sign, which was the last sign, &gt;&gt; Abraham and Sarah's body changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know &gt;&gt; if it was you the reb would have manufactur something the word itself it will manufacture something not you are saying not what you Not what you think by the way itself. If it is if it is said by him that word will start to do his work. It it wasn't something they have drink. something they've washed themselves. &gt;&gt; They wait. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm coming finish and their bodies started to change. I don't think they even feel when their bodies were changing. What is what is happening? &gt;&gt; But when they were going to that king there, that king, &gt;&gt; that king when he looked at Sarah and Abraham He saw two, [singing and music] a young man and a young lady. He said, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; what is your relationship with?" He wanted this young lady and this lady I believe was even greater than the mother of this king. But because now something is working within. If we are the seed of Abraham, we must expect something. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here but I will come and read it again and again and again. Amen. But you know it. I just read. &gt;&gt; But you know in this book two is the scene. You must you must understand that I said it was the last sign. After that what happened? Changing of body, pregnancy, birth of Isaac. After that, after that last, changing of body, pregnancy and birth of Isaac. Hallelujah. But let me read for you here. &gt;&gt; It says here in this book, true is a seal. I see if they have got it there, they will flush it. If they don't seal, I'm going to read page 142. It says here &gt;&gt; now I preach here one time and told you that God turned them back to young men and woman turn them back to young man and woman to prove it. When they went down, they took a little trip and went down to Gerbalik, &gt;&gt; the Philistine king, &gt;&gt; fell in love with Sarah and wanted to marry her. Of course, she was young, a young woman, beautiful. Notice he had to do something. He had to change her. When he said he had to do something, he mean God God had to do something. This time is the time of resting. &gt;&gt; I will tell you, &gt;&gt; he had to do something. He had to change her. He didn't just put her back to a young man and woman. Him and her. He didn't do that because if if they would the same thing would have existed. Let me say something. It means if he had changed them to a young man and young woman. Abraham Abraham &gt;&gt; married Sarah when she was young. say she was about she was about 18 years she he married her there and if God could turn her back to that he will be a young woman but barren But God, he must not he he had to change even the inside. That's why he had to change you from the inside. Amen. Brother says &gt;&gt; you know I don't know there is a certain thing called the cockab something which it is sticky some some thongs outside. He said if in that if there can be a wit seat When time comes the coar will disappear because the wheat seed will come. He said you are a coar you are sticky. But if inside you there is a seat, a wheat seat, you see inside that cockab which was Jacob there was a wheat seat. But that it was sticky. Okay. stealing. &gt;&gt; But the time came when that seat which was inside there [clears throat] came out that coar disappeared. He had he had to change them from let me just read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We said here if he had changed them outside only the same thing would have existed because he married her when he was about 16. They say 16 years. He was just a young man. They lived their life with no ch children. If he just said them back, well, they would just done the same thing. But he had to do something different. He had to them so that they could have this promised son. The promised son they was going to receive. But he had to change their whole system and turn them back young and change them to receive the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That was the last sign to Abraham. It was the prophetic sign. &gt;&gt; And I said that because he had to appear to the Gentiles with the same sight. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it is the same side, &gt;&gt; it will be the same the last side because we are the royal seed of Abraham. If our father has received that sign, we must receive the same. Let me uh read something for you here. &gt;&gt; He has to reveal himself to us the same way. Let me just read this to you. He came as a son of man, a prophet because that fulfills the scripture Moses said. So he had to come according to the scripture a prophet. He never called himself son of God. He called himself son of man but he is but he through the church ages now he has been the son of god in the millennium in the millennium he will be the son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time we find out by the scripture. He is to reveal himself again. &gt;&gt; A son of man, &gt;&gt; the prophet &gt;&gt; Melkisedc. &gt;&gt; Melisedc are you? Are you here? &gt;&gt; All right. If you are here, let me read another one. The old ball. I want to read the odd ball here. We believe that God is to be manifested in the last days among his people to the elect seat according to the Bible in the form of prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words to the gentile. He had to reveal himself. in the form of a prophet. That is exactly with the word. Not the man, not that man is God, but the gift is God. In other words, when he revealed himself to us in a man as a prophet is not that that man is God, but that the gift is God. Amen. We know that he has revealed himself &gt;&gt; to us. But can I show you something again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has already revealed himself to us. He revealed as he revealed him like he revealed himself to Abraham. Do you believe that? If you don't believe it, let me prove it. I prove it &gt;&gt; that he has revealed himself to us &gt;&gt; just like he revealed to Abraham. I said that was the last sign. And if he has revealed to himself to us like he reveals it to Abraham, it is the answer then what must we expect? this book uh the the I think the brothers here will flush it is uh these the scriptures for faith. &gt;&gt; Listen here brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; and the elders &gt;&gt; page 252 not page paragraph &gt;&gt; page 29. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother turns his back to the congregation like this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he sat. &gt;&gt; Here is a lady sitting right back here behind me. Hear what he said? Amen. Stand like this. He said, "Here is a lady standing behind me. She's like Sara." &gt;&gt; Who was doing that? Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Elohim. Elohim. They said the man was not a god but the gift was God. He was manifesting the last sign to the royal seed of Abraham. He said you are stand you are behind me was in the tent. She said she she is praying for a daughter. Stand up. The daughter is not here. What was this? &gt;&gt; It was the sign. It was the manifestation of Luke 17:8. Luke 17:8. When the son of man, reveal himself. He revealed himself. What? What do you want? &gt;&gt; What do you want, church? Because he has revealed, he has revealed, he has made the sign of Elohim when he was with Sarah and Abraham there. He had showed us that sign and that was the last sign. I don't know what you perhaps you want all night prayer perhaps you want you want fasting 30 days perhaps Abraham and Sarah after they've received that descendment Perhaps they they fasted. Perhaps it's the way you think. But the scripture they didn't do that. Amen. But the weight was in that weight which was in did his work. Hallelujah. He don't need your help. You can go to &gt;&gt; they will help you. They'll give you chance to jump to manufacture to show that you have the spirit. Let me read this one here. I am about to finish. Don't worry. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 194 &gt;&gt; CO par 963. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was the last sign that they had before that promise? They had waited on for this years. Was God standing in the form of man? The last to Abraham and it was God the form of man. &gt;&gt; What was your last sign? It was God standing in the form of &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who could descend the thoughts that was in the church representing the church? Immediately after that, she changed back to a young man. Brother says, &gt;&gt; "I believe you are seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the rapture. You are seeing the last thing." He was telling these people, I am telling you, &gt;&gt; you have seen Amen. &gt;&gt; You have seen the last thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That will happen before the rapture. &gt;&gt; That is exactly I believe it. Leing the rain is over. &gt;&gt; What does the rain represent? The Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; The rain is over. &gt;&gt; If you want the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; go to the mountain. But I tell you, will come with the spirit of the mountain. Are you with me church? &gt;&gt; Let me say something here. Um after that last sign, &gt;&gt; I said the following happened. The following happened, change of body, pregnancy, birth of Isaac. Where are we now? We are at the stage of pregnancy &gt;&gt; because brother Brenham said the weight is in the bread just like it was in Mary. What did the word do in Mary? He said the weight became blood. Amen. Now the weight is in the bride. Brothers, let me just read something here. um is you know it I just repeat it &gt;&gt; uh page 14 it says here paragraph 246 we cannot receive the promised son &gt;&gt; that is promised us today &gt;&gt; in this Buddhist that we live in these bodies are a sin. Let me read 248. &gt;&gt; It is not this outside which is see man. This it this is subject to death. It will die. But the inside part of you down in there, down in here, inside that is the person that cannot die. And that is the person that that the new life starts from. He said it builds another person in the image of this person you are and around that life. In other words inside you something is formed. He says here so potentially it is in here. What is it? The wait promised before the foundation of the world around around there. This only reflect the negative that will reflect the positive. The weight and the same thing or the translation of the bride will be the same thing. The way that is in you, the body will materialize that word. And the same did by the word that is in you. What is in you this age? we are living in has got its message. Amen. It's pass the denomination. That's why some of our brothers they try they try to scroll to to reach that because it has it has moved. You cannot you cannot try to think about it. It has moved from your mind. It is upside there. This age we are living in is another age. It has its message and the prophet says the message it is the next announcement. If it is the next was the first this one is the next. Amen. You must know the first then you know the next. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you don't know the first, you will say the next is the first. &gt;&gt; He says it is the next announcement. &gt;&gt; But let me just read it here. &gt;&gt; Um, let me perhaps be faster. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it easy? H is this the sign of the answer? Paragraph 26. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 2. &gt;&gt; This angel come down from heaven. He's talking about chapter 10. He said the other seven angels of seven are of the seven church ages messengers. But this angel all the message is finished. I said to you one day has preach everything. everything. &gt;&gt; The message is finished. [applause] The seventh angel, the seventh angel wings up the whole thing. And this angel comes not to the earth. He is he isn't a man from the earth &gt;&gt; as the messengers to the church that is finished. But this angel brings the next announcement. And an angel is a messenger. He comes down from heaven clothed in that pillar of life with a rainbow over his head. The rainbow was a covenant. It was Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was this announcement for? This announcement is a call to come to eat to eat. This announcement is a call to the bride, to the eagles to come and gather and eat to the store fruit, the hidden mana, cigarette food. This next announcement, &gt;&gt; it is a calling &gt;&gt; is calling us because if you are pregnant, you need special diets, you don't just eat. You know, you women, you don't, if you want your baby to grow healthier, You must select the food. We are pregnant. &gt;&gt; I am happy to tell you I am pregnant. That is the reason I don't just eat. Hallelujah. When you try to feed me, I look at you because I know the food that must fit that baby so that he can grow. When he has grown enough, he will be born. Amen. Let me read this. The prophet what is the prophet says here it may be the end time. It may be the time the time the rainbow the rainbows will sweep across the sky. an announcement from heaven saying time is no more. If it is, let us prepare ourselves friends to meet our God. There has been plenty of food laid in now. We must prepare ourselves &gt;&gt; so that we must have this food plenty of food. We are not playing here. Let's make use of it. &gt;&gt; Let Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's make use of it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; This food hidden manner. &gt;&gt; This what the prophet says here. when he was praying here. &gt;&gt; Let me if the book I can have it here because what is the hidden fruit? &gt;&gt; The revelation of the son of man. Amen. the the Mechisedc Melkisedc &gt;&gt; because the prophetic sign &gt;&gt; is the son of Melkisedc. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Is the sign of Melisedc? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Guess why our prophet preached? Who? Who is this? Where was that? He was in that man. They revealed himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe you believe it. that he revealed himself through the prophet. He says here he was pray. We see the handwriting on the wall. We are at the end time. We know that there is great thing laying ahead. But yet somewhere out in this mess is still there. There are still honest people that is being ordained to life. It would be impossible for one man or two but God all of us together Let us every let us go let us spread to every corner the good news that Jesus is coming. Just spread the little bread along along a little weight wherever the eagles are. Amen. &gt;&gt; They will follow that foot. &gt;&gt; He says the mana &gt;&gt; is the cass. &gt;&gt; Where the cass is the angels will gather and the cass is the word of God for your season. We have got the word of God for this season. That is the cass. &gt;&gt; What is the cass? &gt;&gt; The weight of God Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; I don't want to read the quotes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The is Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of man. the boot of the son of man. This is the time to eat the kakas which is the good weight. Let me read this one first. It says here I want to start it in the middle there. &gt;&gt; I want to study in the middle page 59 paragraph 269 anointed ones. But I I read it in the middle there. He said I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't that I knew. It was what I just surrender myself to. He spoke through me. It was the seventh angel. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel. His message. It was the mystery that got unfolded. Is not a man. Is God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. Who the angel is talking about? William Brennham. He was not the son of man. He was he was the messenger from the son of God. The messenger from the son of man. The son of man revealed himself through this man. Amen. The son of man is Christ. He is the one that you are feeding on. You are not feeding on a man. A man and his ways will fail. But you are feeding on the unfailing, the body weight of the son of man. The cacas. The cass is the body weight of the son of man is the hidden man. To access the man, there must be a man. That's why God said, "I will give you pastors who will feed you with knowledge and understanding because God brings the message directly to him. He has that access so that he must get where in that holy of holies where the mana is placed so that he can go there. Pick that man and so that he can feed you [cheering] [applause] is a special diet. The hidden mana is a special diet for the pregnant people. The special diet is for the big fish. If you want to catch the big fish, you must use a special diet. If you want to catch a big fish, you must have a special diet. to catch the bride to to attract the bride. You must use the special food. That is the third pool. This is the dispensation of the first the third pool because the big fish is caught by the third.
