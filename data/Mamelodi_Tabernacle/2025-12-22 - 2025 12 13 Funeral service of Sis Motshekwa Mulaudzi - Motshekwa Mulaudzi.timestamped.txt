[10:32] the family of
[10:43] we say thank you.
[10:54] You are doing the right thing because
[10:56] the Bible says to go to the family which
[11:00] is better than to go to the family.
[11:14] You are doing the right thing by saying
[11:16] comfort the person which you know him
[11:19] better.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; We are saying to the family
[11:34] what you have done to help one another.
[11:38] That is what you supposed to do as a
[11:40] family while you are still living.
[11:46] We we are saying to all of you
[11:52] &gt;&gt; this uh old lady which we are gathered
[11:56] here because of her.
[12:02] We are the eyewitness that she have been
[12:05] sick for long time.
[12:16] As a family, they didn't fold up their
[12:19] arms. They have done whatever they can
[12:21] in order to save the life of her mother.
[12:32] Our
[12:37] mother she have passed on while she was
[12:39] there in the hospital at hospital but we
[12:42] have done everything we can so that she
[12:44] can leave.
[12:54] You as a witness just believe that it is
[12:58] through our mother she have passed on.
[13:07] We don't want to hear a myth when you
[13:10] said we have seen our mother uh doing
[13:14] some woodwork or something uh on the
[13:18] bushes.
[13:24] You are a eyewitness that we have buried
[13:26] our mother.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; We can say to the children
[13:34] a departure of our mother.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; The family is still around.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Make sure that we give them the news.
[13:50] Let's not just take rational decisions
[13:53] alone.
[13:58] Tomorrow those decisions will hurt us if
[14:00] we don't contact the family.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; The ta family,
[14:08] &gt;&gt; the family still around you.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; The
[14:14] grandchildren, they are still here.
[14:18] Come and visit
[14:21] as you used to do when you used to visit
[14:24] your
[14:26] all these families.
[14:29] Go to them
[14:32] and give a support.
[14:45] We know that the departure of our mother
[14:47] doesn't separate us as a family. It must
[14:50] unite us.
[14:56] When we are saying the elders from the
[14:58] church,
[15:04] we don't want to disturb them. When we
[15:07] leave here, we are going to the
[15:09] graveyard.
[15:27] This is a royal family. Normally the way
[15:30] we bury our people sometimes it might
[15:34] surprise you the way we do our
[15:36] traditional ours.
[15:44] If you feel free, just go there. But if
[15:48] you are not free, don't just go there.
[16:05] We have as family accepted that it is
[16:08] true our mother. She have she have left
[16:11] or she have passed on.
[16:23] I normally sing this song.
[16:36] Buddha

[18:22] Presenting Thomas Sag which is my older
[18:25] brother.
[18:29] Today he is not here.
[18:32] He had some commitment.
[18:46] I accepted that command from my brother.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; We are really deeply saddened by the
[19:01] departure of our elder mother.
[19:14] To me, she she was not like a granny.
[19:17] She was like my mother because I know a
[19:20] lot about the mother.
[19:29] From my youth up until today, I've
[19:32] learned from the eld mother.
[19:42] I really thank God because he left me
[19:45] while I know how to do things for my
[19:48] own.
[19:54] I saw my great mother for quite a long
[19:58] long time while she was sick.
[20:05] Even on her last days I was here. I'm
[20:08] I'm the one who took her to the
[20:10] hospital.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; I remember last of last week on Friday
[20:18] while I was talking to her through a
[20:20] phone.
[20:23] First thing she asked that did you come
[20:26] back?
[20:32] Uh she asked me a question and then I
[20:35] said to her did you come back and she
[20:37] said when are you going to come back?
[20:43] And then I answered that I will wait for
[20:46] the closure at work so that I can come
[20:48] back home.
[20:54] She asked that, "Can you fetch for me a
[20:57] pig and a goat?"
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Um, I really want to eat the meat of
[21:07] that while I'm seated with you at
[21:09] hospital.
[21:17] Things turn around after I hear about
[21:21] the call about my uncle uh the departure
[21:25] of our mother.
[21:29] We accepted that it is God's love.
[21:43] As for my for me, I really feel that it
[21:47] was a blessing from God to really heal
[21:51] is a truly healing of our mother.
[22:15] as a grandchildren. We will be united.
[22:18] We will always put our differences
[22:20] aside. As a people, we need to fight
[22:23] forward together as a grandchildren.
[22:28] I really thank you. Amen.

[25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:34] of the children.
[25:47] Morning
[26:03] everybody.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; I'm deeply silent about the
[26:23] especially myself and
[26:33] &gt;&gt; because our mother,
[26:38] &gt;&gt; she is the one that raised us up.
[26:42] 1976.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; When we came to this land in 1976,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; she took all of us and bring us all of
[26:54] us here.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; We we we came here and we grow up with
[27:10] She taught us a lot of things like
[27:13] plowing.
[27:21] She also taught us about going to the
[27:24] root.
[27:29] She taught us a lot of things also
[27:32] including the love of people.
[27:39] I remember uh
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. I remembered while I was uh being
[27:48] married.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; She was very upset.
[27:56] She asked me a question. Where are you
[27:58] going, my my daughter?
[28:01] And then I told I told her that I'm
[28:03] going to to be married.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; She said, "You cannot go there."
[28:12] &gt;&gt; I said, "Mother, can you allow me to go
[28:15] for to be married?"
[28:19] She said, "Listen to me.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; If somebody have hurt you,
[28:28] &gt;&gt; don't ever come back.
[28:33] Just tell me what hurt you so that I can
[28:36] give you some advice.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; You don't go there alone.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; I went there with damu.
[28:49] When we arrived there, there was they
[28:51] were really comforting us.
[28:58] All these children When they returned
[29:00] back home, I really bitterly cried.
[29:06] I remember the words of the of our
[29:09] mother that she didn't want us to go
[29:12] there.
[29:20] One thing which my mother have told me
[29:23] is that if a man comes back at night,
[29:30] You need to make sure that there's a
[29:32] warm water and then there's a food for
[29:35] your husband.
[29:39] After that, you go and sleep.
[29:46] If your husband looking for for the
[29:49] porridge, you must tell her that tell
[29:52] him that I have already cooked. It's
[29:54] just that is now cold.
[30:01] that your husband cannot come to my
[30:03] house and tell me that you didn't cook
[30:05] for him.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; My children's mother
[30:13] &gt;&gt; our mother have
[30:17] this agree
[30:22] &gt;&gt; I can spend a lot of time
[30:27] We didn't know by the name her by the
[30:30] name of
[30:34] &gt;&gt; we knew our mother by my mother
[30:41] the name English.
[30:46] She really likes those names English for
[30:50] my mother. She really
[31:02] and double let's just accept
[31:07] even if we have lost our mother
[31:15] let's agree that it is true she have
[31:18] taught us a lesson whatever she have
[31:20] taught us we really put into our
[31:27] I will sit back. Thanks very much.

[31:56] family.

[32:21] Savior Jesus Christ. I say amen.
[32:41] I feel I I was supposed to speak as a
[32:44] representative of the family.
[32:58] The mother here, she is my
[33:03] aunt. Yes,
[33:05] she's my aunt. Yes.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; She was the one who would take care of
[33:14] me from grade one up until grade 12.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm feeling very
[33:23] a pain in my heart.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; I grew well but the departure of our
[33:32] mother I feel like I've lost
[33:42] the Bible is true that when it says
[33:46] everyone is going to the grave
[33:54] Yes, she have been departed but we are
[33:57] remaining behind.
[34:03] Family of I really appreciate a lot for
[34:07] your support.
[34:14] We I just want to say we really feel sad
[34:17] by the departure of our mother.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; I wanted to take it another way of
[34:28] celebrating the life of our mother. But
[34:31] I really can't feel
[34:37] &gt;&gt; this is a very sad moment
[34:40] for the departure of our mother.
[34:54] When I arrived to the family, I really
[34:56] feels really wanted to even change my
[35:00] signing from.
[35:07] I really feel very saddened by the
[35:09] departure of our mother.
[35:18] I've grown up knowing my mother as mama
[35:22] uh as we used to call her
[35:29] with this few words I really say thank

[37:45] how
[37:49] I know I
[38:04] know Morning
[38:12] everybody.
[38:20] The way
[38:25] the way I was so touched I don't know
[38:27] whether I was supposed to write or
[38:29] whether I would put it the right way.
[38:41] It was supposed to be unclea on my place
[38:45] on his place, but he said my my young
[38:49] brother just stand up for me on my
[38:52] behalf.
[38:55] I'm just
[38:59] nephew. I'm just a nephew.
[39:14] We as a family
[39:16] of
[39:21] we accepted that
[39:24] have departed.
[39:30] She was really sick. You have the
[39:33] testimony.
[39:39] She was admitted at the hospital
[39:42] hospital.
[39:46] I went there to visit her after hearing
[39:49] that she's not well.
[39:54] What makes me happy? When I arrived
[39:56] hospital, she was smiling.
[40:02] I asked a mother and said, "Did you know
[40:05] me?" She said, "Yes, I saw you entering
[40:09] the hospital."
[40:13] We gave her support thinking that she's
[40:16] going to get help.
[40:21] But our God took her.
[40:28] We accept that God have done his love.
[40:38] What makes us happy is just that
[40:45] she left us accepted our Lord and Savior
[40:50] Jesus Christ and she was living for God.
[41:05] It really comforted us as the Bible have
[41:08] indicated that whoever that believeth in
[41:11] the Lord Jesus Christ and being saved
[41:13] and being baptized, it really makes us
[41:16] happy because she was in the Lord.
[41:26] When she departed here, she will get
[41:29] eternal life.
[41:38] as a Christian family. Uh it it it tells
[41:43] us that uh we must not just cry without
[41:46] a hope.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; When she was called by the name English,
[41:58] it shows me that The family were very
[42:01] wise.
[42:05] I can imagine if she was educated what
[42:08] is going to happen.
[42:12] They were full of love which you cannot
[42:14] able to explain.
[42:18] He used to unite us.

[42:56] traditional
[42:57] Hey,
[43:23] when I was still young, I really I was
[43:26] staying with another family. Then the
[43:29] aunt told me that I must visit
[43:32] as a traditional healer. And then I
[43:35] really look for that traditional healer.
[43:38] And then they direct me that that is the
[43:40] place where you are supposed to get
[43:42] healing there.
[44:02] She used to to book for for us to book a
[44:07] line so that we can able to see that
[44:09] traditional healer because that place it
[44:11] used to get full with a lot of people
[44:13] who came to consult there at the
[44:16] traditional healer and then we end up
[44:18] sleeping there.
[44:20] So that we can get help tomorrow.
[44:46] She used to arrange for us and then we
[44:49] we normally take early taxi so that we
[44:52] can able to depart from family to go and

[1:08:34] Over to you.
[1:08:37] I greet you all in the precious name of
[1:08:39] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:08:45] We have a very short time,
[1:08:51] but I want to thank you all
[1:08:55] for being present
[1:08:59] in the service of our mother.
[1:09:07] May the Lord richly bless you all.
[1:09:12] May the Lord bless.
[1:09:18] May the Lord bless the family and the
[1:09:20] neighbors
[1:09:24] and all the elders and the people from
[1:09:28] the village.
[1:09:33] Even those that are coming from a far
[1:09:35] off, may the Lord richly bless you.
[1:09:42] I'm not a pastor.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; He is not a pastor.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just an elder in the church.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; A pastor means a shepherd.
[1:09:56] So just bear with me as I will be
[1:09:58] reading the scriptures.
[1:10:04] For those that are able to stand
[1:10:08] in respect of the word, I will ask you
[1:10:10] to stand
[1:10:13] as we read the book of First
[1:10:14] Thessalonians
[1:10:18] starting from verse 18 to verse 18
[1:10:32] to say a word of prayer.
[1:10:41] Amen. Amen. We can pray.
[1:10:57] To pay a last respect to our mother.
[1:11:10] figure.
[1:12:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:07] Verse 18 says,
[1:12:10] "But I will not have you to be ignorant,
[1:12:14] brethren,
[1:12:16] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:12:18] you sorrow not, even as others who have
[1:12:21] no hope.
[1:12:24] For if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:12:26] rose again, even so them also who sleep
[1:12:29] in Jesus, will God bring?"
[1:12:34] For this we say unto you by the word of
[1:12:36] the Lord, that we which are alive and
[1:12:39] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:12:42] not prevent them who shall asleep.
[1:12:45] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:12:47] heaven with a shout,
[1:12:49] with the voice of an archangel, and with
[1:12:51] the trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[1:12:54] shall rise first.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:12:58] be caught up together with them in the
[1:13:00] clouds to be the Lord in the air.
[1:13:04] So shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:13:06] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:13:09] words.
[1:13:16] Yes.
[1:13:35] Foreign
[1:14:05] Fore!
[1:14:25] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:14:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; So I'm here just to comfort the
[1:14:49] feminine.
[1:14:53] You know, every time I read the word of
[1:14:55] God,
[1:14:58] I find a love story.
[1:15:04] You know, I always wondered why they
[1:15:06] called the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:15:08] bridegroom.
[1:15:19] The reason I call it a love story,
[1:15:25] a man
[1:15:27] when he proposes a woman,
[1:15:31] he gives promises,
[1:15:36] I promise you that I will build you the
[1:15:39] best house.
[1:15:43] In another wedding, I remember
[1:15:48] the a wife a seedless.
[1:15:55] There's a lot of promises when a man
[1:15:57] proposes a woman.
[1:16:04] I'll make you the best woman on earth.
[1:16:11] I'll give you my name.
[1:16:15] You know all the promises.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I had another one even promising the
[1:16:23] woman
[1:16:26] a train.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; A proposal goes with a lot of things
[1:16:33] inside.
[1:16:39] The Lord Jesus Christ when he came to
[1:16:41] the earth
[1:16:44] He brought a message
[1:16:47] to propose us.
[1:16:50] The Bible says,
[1:16:53] "The Lord himself shall descend from
[1:16:55] heaven with a shout."
[1:17:00] So he descended all the way from heaven.
[1:17:05] And the Bible says with a shout.
[1:17:10] out was a proposal.
[1:17:14] It was a message going forth.
[1:17:18] So when he was giving out the message,
[1:17:22] there were so many promises.
[1:17:26] One of the promises,
[1:17:28] he says, if you believe my saying,
[1:17:34] verily, verily I say unto you,
[1:17:38] you shall not see death.
[1:17:41] What a proposal.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody was scared of death.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; But when he descended coming down,
[1:17:51] uh my brother, if you can just read,
[1:17:57] I just want to show you this love story.
[1:18:02] You know, uh John chapter 8 and verse
[1:18:05] 51.
[1:18:08] And and here when he was coming down
[1:18:12] a message out
[1:18:15] one of the promises
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; that he brought
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; in the proposal
[1:18:21] he shall not see death.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Can you read it my brother? 8:51 verily
[1:18:27] verily I say unto you if a man keep my
[1:18:30] saying he shall not see death. You see
[1:18:33] where we read
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; it says
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I will not have you to be ignorant.
[1:18:46] You know in in the language that we use
[1:18:48] here on the earth
[1:18:52] somebody depart
[1:18:55] the language that people understand
[1:19:01] it says the person is dead.
[1:19:07] But when the Lord Jesus Christ came,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; he says that is an error.
[1:19:16] When you read Matthew chap 22 verse 292
[1:19:24] that is an error
[1:19:27] that's why he says I don't want you to
[1:19:28] be ignorant.
[1:19:34] When Lazarus was sick
[1:19:38] He said, "Our friend Lazarus
[1:19:43] sleep."
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You know, the disciples didn't even
[1:19:47] understand.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh Lord,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; he if he sleep,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; if Adam he does work,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; he will wake up."
[1:20:04] So he had to talk to them in a language
[1:20:07] that they understand.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Lazarus is dead.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; The language they understand.
[1:20:21] So our mother
[1:20:24] believed the proposal
[1:20:27] that came when the Lord descended coming
[1:20:30] to the end.
[1:20:33] when he gave our mother a proposal
[1:20:38] to say, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:20:43] if you believe my saying,
[1:20:46] you shall not see death." Our mother
[1:20:49] said, "Amen."
[1:20:51] Accepting that proposal
[1:20:55] death
[1:20:57] if we have to define it.
[1:21:00] The Bible say death
[1:21:03] is total separation from God.
[1:21:08] So our mother is not separated from God.
[1:21:13] You see there are people that die
[1:21:16] that are separated from God.
[1:21:19] But the one that believe he's saying
[1:21:24] will not see death. Meaning he is not
[1:21:28] totally separated.
[1:21:31] You see a person is a triune being.
[1:21:36] You are a body
[1:21:39] which is this terrestrial being.
[1:21:44] When Job looked at it,
[1:21:48] say this one is full of troubles
[1:21:52] and it's of few days
[1:21:55] when the prophet Job looked at this body
[1:22:00] said ah this one is full of trouble.
[1:22:04] So you can't even brag about this.
[1:22:08] I heard one of the scientist
[1:22:11] saying this body is not even worth more
[1:22:14] than 10 cent.
[1:22:21] So it's not worth much.
[1:22:25] Then inside of this body
[1:22:29] is a spirit.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You see when the Lord made a person
[1:22:36] He said
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; when we read Genesis chapter
[1:22:42] 2 verse 7
[1:22:46] it says and God formed man out of the
[1:22:49] dust of the earth.
[1:22:54] So this man is of the dust of the earth.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's why we
[1:23:00] take him back to the grave.
[1:23:05] But then he says he breath into his
[1:23:08] nostrils
[1:23:11] breath of life
[1:23:14] as a man became a living soul.
[1:23:18] So you are a triune being
[1:23:21] you are a body,
[1:23:23] you are the spirit
[1:23:26] and you are a soul.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Now when you depart
[1:23:35] The Bible says
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; goes back to God,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; the body
[1:23:47] goes to the grave.
[1:23:49] But the soul
[1:23:52] when it departs,
[1:23:54] it depends what you believe.
[1:23:58] If you believe the word of God,
[1:24:01] it goes under the altar.
[1:24:04] It is in the presence of the Almighty
[1:24:07] Lord.
[1:24:09] If you didn't believe his saying,
[1:24:14] you are soul go to the prison house
[1:24:19] and the language that we use
[1:24:22] it goes to hell and it will be tormented
[1:24:27] in flames.
[1:24:29] But
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; you see the Lord Jesus Christ said
[1:24:34] we
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; because if you believe he's saying
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; you shall not see death.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And he said I am
[1:24:48] I want you to read that scripture.
[1:24:51] Matthew 22 verse start with 29
[1:24:57] and go to verse 32.
[1:25:02] Matthew 22 verse 29.
[1:25:05] Jesus answered and said unto them, he do
[1:25:08] a not knowing the scriptures nor the
[1:25:11] power of God.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 32,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; 30
[1:25:18] 31 and 32.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; But touching the resurrection of the
[1:25:23] dead, have ye not read that which was
[1:25:26] spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the
[1:25:29] God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and
[1:25:32] the God of Jacob. God is not the God of
[1:25:35] the dead, but of the living.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; You see, let's go back to John chapter 8
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; because he says, God is not God of the
[1:25:45] dead.
[1:25:50] Death is total separation from God.
[1:25:56] So when they look at Abraham,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Isaac, Isaac and Jacob,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; they are not dead.
[1:26:04] Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he says God is not God of the
[1:26:08] dead
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; because they are in the presence of the
[1:26:16] almighty God.
[1:26:19] But those that are not in the presence
[1:26:20] of the almighty God,
[1:26:24] they are dead.
[1:26:26] So we must never
[1:26:31] go and see what they were saying
[1:26:36] starting from verse 51.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; I will read it my brother and you will
[1:26:41] interpret it. Chapter 8.
[1:26:45] Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man
[1:26:48] keep my saying, he shall never see
[1:26:49] death.
[1:26:55] They challenged him.
[1:26:58] They challenged the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:27:04] They said, "Now we know you have a
[1:27:06] devil."
[1:27:10] You see, when he was telling proposing
[1:27:15] and saying you shall not see death.
[1:27:19] They said this man has a death.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; They were not accepting the proposal.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; They said Abraham is dead.
[1:27:31] But before that
[1:27:33] he said unto the same people,
[1:27:37] God is not the God of the dead.
[1:27:41] He is the God of the viv.
[1:27:44] See, he said, "I am
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; the God." Read that verse 32 again, my
[1:27:50] brother.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 32.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I am the God of Abraham and the God of
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Just there is a present tense.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say I was
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; because they passed away.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It says I am.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:28:11] I am the God of Abraham
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; and the God of Isaac
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; God is not God of the dead and the
[1:28:21] living.
[1:28:24] They challenge him. Now they say now we
[1:28:27] know you have a devil.
[1:28:32] The prophets are dead.
[1:28:36] How can you say
[1:28:38] if a man keep my saying
[1:28:42] he shall have a taste of death?
[1:28:47] They looked at him. He was a very young
[1:28:50] man.
[1:28:52] 33 years old.
[1:28:59] When they looked at him,
[1:29:01] art thou greater than our father
[1:29:03] Abraham?
[1:29:07] And they reminded him
[1:29:10] which is dead
[1:29:14] and the prophets
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; are dead
[1:29:21] what makest thou?
[1:29:27] You know I'm sure they were even saying
[1:29:30] undermining him.
[1:29:40] You know somewhere they even say you are
[1:29:42] not even 50 years old
[1:29:46] and you say you have seen our father
[1:29:47] Abraham
[1:29:50] but I don't
[1:29:54] and he was giving them a proposal.
[1:29:59] Hallelujah. So even when let's go to the
[1:30:03] book of Genesis.
[1:30:07] You see when when
[1:30:10] the wife of Jacob passed away
[1:30:16] 35 verse 185
[1:30:19] 18
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; and it came to pass
[1:30:23] as her soul was ineparting
[1:30:31] now because they understand people won't
[1:30:33] understand the soul is in departing
[1:30:38] they say for she died
[1:30:42] just to make people understand
[1:30:47] but the Bible doesn't say if you believe
[1:30:50] the gospel of Jesus Christ you die
[1:30:58] you depart
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; you know you go to it's like a promotion
[1:31:04] you go to the presence of the almighty
[1:31:06] god.
[1:31:09] You see here on the earth we are absent
[1:31:14] from the almighty god.
[1:31:17] So he comes and propose you
[1:31:20] so that when you depart
[1:31:23] you come into his presence.
[1:31:26] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the book of
[1:31:28] Thessalonians.
[1:31:30] See that shout
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; was the message going forth.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 25,
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; they talk about the wise and the foolish
[1:31:47] visions.
[1:31:50] You see the message when it goes forth,
[1:31:54] it goes to the wise
[1:31:58] and it goes to the foolish.
[1:32:01] You see when when you sleep
[1:32:05] the wise and the foolish
[1:32:09] they slept.
[1:32:11] Now when the bridegroom came
[1:32:16] they woke up.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; That was the resurrection.
[1:32:20] Now when when the wise
[1:32:24] woke up
[1:32:25] because they had the spirit that raised
[1:32:28] Jesus Christ from the dead,
[1:32:33] they went with the bridegroom.
[1:32:37] But these others, they didn't go with
[1:32:39] the bridegroom.
[1:32:49] You see You need to have the spirit that
[1:32:53] raised Jesus Christ from the dead in you
[1:33:00] before you depart
[1:33:03] because it is the same spirit that will
[1:33:05] raise you up.
[1:33:09] Now let's go back to the book of
[1:33:11] Thessalonians.
[1:33:14] You see when he was proposing now
[1:33:18] the first promise that he gave said you
[1:33:21] shall never see death.
[1:33:23] That was the first promise.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Now the second promise was the voice.
[1:33:30] Now that voice is the resurrection.
[1:33:35] You see the Bible says blessed are those
[1:33:38] that come in the first resurrection.
[1:33:44] says, "After you have departed,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; you are not dead,
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; and I will raise you up."
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 5.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I won't be long.
[1:34:03] I'm just telling you about the proposal
[1:34:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:08] The first thing he said, "You shall not
[1:34:09] see death.
[1:34:13] John chapter 5.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Let's read
[1:34:18] verse 25. Let's start with verse 24. My
[1:34:21] brother,
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; verily, verily I say unto you, he that
[1:34:25] heareth my word and believe on him that
[1:34:28] sent me have everlasting life.
[1:34:47] Can you finish it, my brother?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And shall not come into condemnation,
[1:34:51] but is passed from death unto life. What
[1:34:54] a promise.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; You see the proposal,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; this proposal thing didn't start
[1:35:04] here.
[1:35:07] for a man to propose a woman.
[1:35:13] The Lord himself when he came HERE WHEN
[1:35:17] HE MET us he started with a proposal
[1:35:22] if you hear my way.
[1:35:24] You have everlasting life.
[1:35:27] What do you say?
[1:35:29] If you hear
[1:35:32] you have everlasting life if you believe
[1:35:36] You shall not come into condemnation,
[1:35:40] but you have passed from death
[1:35:43] to life.
[1:35:45] Even the scientists cannot promise you
[1:35:46] this.
[1:35:56] They talk about the shooting going up
[1:35:58] there.
[1:36:07] When you ask them about death,
[1:36:10] countenance fall
[1:36:14] about death.
[1:36:17] You go to a medical doctor
[1:36:21] for you to get healing
[1:36:23] to give you this injection.
[1:36:27] Ask them about death.
[1:36:30] The countenance for
[1:36:33] they can't promise you anything.
[1:36:36] One man promised us life.
[1:36:42] My brother
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; 25
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; verily verily I say unto you the hour is
[1:36:46] coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:36:49] hear the voice of the son of God and
[1:36:52] they that shall live.
[1:37:06] You see that was the second promise.
[1:37:09] He says in his proposal
[1:37:13] you'll come in the first resurrection
[1:37:17] my voice
[1:37:19] then he says if you don't believe me
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; come let's go I will show you where's
[1:37:25] Lazarus
[1:37:29] let me show you my second promise
[1:37:34] come forth
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and Lazarus came forth
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; demonstrating the promise promise
[1:37:41] even if you depart.
[1:37:45] I will bring you up. You will be blessed
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; because you will come in the second in
[1:37:50] the first resurrection.
[1:37:53] Then he didn't stop there with the
[1:37:55] promise.
[1:37:57] He went again
[1:37:59] and said and the trumpet of God shall
[1:38:01] sound.
[1:38:04] This is the most beautiful part.
[1:38:08] You propose a woman and the woman accept
[1:38:13] your proposal.
[1:38:15] Go home. You tell your parents.
[1:38:19] I'm ready to get married.
[1:38:22] You promised them a white wedding.
[1:38:26] That's what the Lord did. HE SAID IF YOU
[1:38:29] ACCEPT MY proposal
[1:38:32] you know after the resurrection
[1:38:35] we will meet again I'll take you to your
[1:38:39] palace
[1:38:42] marriage
[1:38:48] he he gave us a lot of promises
[1:38:52] because we have a short time
[1:38:54] I'm just bringing these three promises
[1:38:58] If you hear his word,
[1:39:01] you have everlasting life. You will not
[1:39:04] come into condemnation.
[1:39:06] If you depart, he will resurrect you.
[1:39:11] And he has already prepared a marriage
[1:39:13] supper.
[1:39:17] You see, not here
[1:39:19] in the palace.
[1:39:22] You see, I've had people reading John 14
[1:39:25] verse 1 and 2.
[1:39:29] When he was leaving, he said, "For those
[1:39:32] that have heard my word,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; don't worry that I'm leaving.
[1:39:38] I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[1:39:41] I will come again
[1:39:43] and receive you unto myself
[1:39:45] and take you into the parish
[1:39:50] supper.
[1:39:52] and and and he he even went further
[1:39:56] and says, "I'm going to bring the Enoch.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the Jews,
[1:40:06] the 144,000
[1:40:08] 144,000 to take care of."
[1:40:12] Hallelujah. You know, and he said after
[1:40:16] the marriage supper,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; we are going for a honeymoon.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to celebrate for 1,000 years
[1:40:26] in the millennia
[1:40:29] before I can take you to the new
[1:40:31] Jerusalem.
[1:40:36] This is a man that has promised,
[1:40:39] YOU SHALL NOT SEE DEATH
[1:40:41] PROPOSAL.
[1:40:43] You shall not see contamination.
[1:40:46] I want to take you to the marriage.
[1:40:49] When you die, I'm going to resurrect
[1:40:50] you.
[1:40:52] DON'T BE IGNORANT OF IT.
[1:40:55] DON'T
[1:40:56] he has all the promises.
[1:40:59] THEN HE SAID AFTER THE SUPPER,
[1:41:04] I'm taking you for a honeymoon.
[1:41:08] How long does your husband take you for
[1:41:09] your honeymoon?
[1:41:15] I still owe my wife a honey
[1:41:18] because
[1:41:22] even if I can afford it
[1:41:25] won't even be more than seven days
[1:41:28] you see but this one
[1:41:32] years
[1:41:35] after the honeymoon
[1:41:37] he says now you are going to judge the
[1:41:39] dead.
[1:41:42] You see the people coming in the second
[1:41:44] resurrection
[1:41:46] the dead
[1:41:51] after that I'm taking you into into our
[1:41:54] housem
[1:42:01] bless you
[1:42:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:08] amen
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; as we stand on our feet.
[1:42:13] We were given up until 8:00.
[1:42:17] So with this few words,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; accept the proposal.
[1:42:27] Like our mother here, she is blessed to
[1:42:31] come in the first resurrection.
[1:42:34] She's going to go into the palace.
[1:42:39] going to go into the millennium
[1:42:42] judge some of the people
[1:42:44] she would go into the new city.
[1:42:48] So if you want to meet our mother if you
[1:42:51] really and truly loved her,
[1:42:54] accept the proposal.
[1:42:57] And if you hear his word,
[1:43:00] our elder indicated,
[1:43:03] you must be baptized in the name of the
[1:43:05] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:43:08] to prove that you have heard
[1:43:11] the proposal of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:43:16] Then we baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:43:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:21] You don't need money.
[1:43:24] You just need to say amen.
[1:43:27] Baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:30] Christ. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:43:34] Just say a word of prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] The great I am
[1:43:57] in this village.
[1:44:04] It goes all around the world.
[1:44:07] It will catch up the real seed of God.
[1:44:12] Bless
[1:44:27] sometimes.
[1:44:40] from our elder
[1:44:44] good wisdom
[1:44:46] to bring these words.
[1:44:49] It takes an effort
[1:44:54] also to be submitted to you
[1:44:58] with your spirit. That spirit that draws
[1:45:00] Jesus Christ of the dead. It is the one
[1:45:03] that is preaching.
[1:45:18] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:45:33] I'm going home.

[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; To
[1:46:20] die no more.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; To die no more.
