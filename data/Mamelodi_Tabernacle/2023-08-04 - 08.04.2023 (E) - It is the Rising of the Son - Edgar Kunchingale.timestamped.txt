[1:08:45] don't get disappointed that's me who is
[1:08:47] preaching
[1:08:48] but
[1:08:53] um
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:55] um
[1:08:57] we have to take care of the vessel which
[1:08:59] we are using Hallelujah
[1:09:03] amen when you use your car you take it
[1:09:07] to The Filling Station to fill up
[1:09:11] so that's uh the ministry
[1:09:16] we are learning a lot
[1:09:20] I'm not ashamed to say
[1:09:23] I have learned a lot from pastor
[1:09:30] that is why
[1:09:33] I'm always close to him
[1:09:36] amen amen so uh
[1:09:40] it's the learning process
[1:09:44] so if you see me performing as an
[1:09:48] apprentice
[1:09:49] as an apprentice like if somebody who is
[1:09:52] a junior
[1:09:59] it's because I'm still learning
[1:10:03] so you need to be patient with me
[1:10:07] so that maybe you just pray for me amen
[1:10:12] so if somebody say ah he wants to preach
[1:10:15] like in kodima
[1:10:19] that's better because we didn't say I'm
[1:10:20] preaching like
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:27] that one would be an offense
[1:10:31] but the other one
[1:10:33] will be a comment very good comments
[1:10:37] I'll be very happy if you say that
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:42] so let's stand
[1:10:58] uh we'll start from the same this which
[1:11:02] the past has been preaching from
[1:11:06] John 14 20.
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:14] my brother
[1:11:24] one Chapter 14 verse 20.
[1:11:29] every day you shall know that I'm in my
[1:11:32] father and ye in me and I in you
[1:11:35] hallelujah
[1:11:42] amen you can pray for us
[1:12:13] um
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:40] so you can visit it
[1:12:45] so
[1:12:46] uh we are talking about the family
[1:12:49] business
[1:12:51] amen amen family business is very
[1:12:54] complicated
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:58] hallelujah hallelujah how many families
[1:13:02] here
[1:13:05] oh some of you don't have families
[1:13:07] I'll tell you what the family is all
[1:13:09] about
[1:13:12] it if you can come from a family as good
[1:13:14] as mine
[1:13:17] always complicated
[1:13:22] they are things which only kept for the
[1:13:25] family
[1:13:29] Hallelujah
[1:13:31] Hallelujah
[1:13:32] family business is very complicated
[1:13:36] amen amen amen
[1:13:40] I was talking uh I was talking with my
[1:13:42] brother for a long time
[1:13:46] no you can stand up
[1:13:49] uh this brother
[1:13:52] we were together in Primary School
[1:13:55] and we have been together in the message
[1:13:57] all the time
[1:14:02] we were not friends in school
[1:14:04] but the message of the hour has made us
[1:14:06] to be friends
[1:14:09] Hallelujah so when Pastor kodima said
[1:14:14] uh you cannot
[1:14:19] you're gonna see what
[1:14:22] you cannot confuse the family
[1:14:27] Hallelujah because family family I don't
[1:14:31] know here if you go to a Farming Gardens
[1:14:34] here
[1:14:37] when there's a dispute
[1:14:44] of a garden
[1:14:52] it's not for those who have come to
[1:14:54] marry in the family to discuss
[1:14:59] those are Outsiders
[1:15:04] it is only for the family to come and
[1:15:07] discuss
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:13] they are the people who tell you this
[1:15:17] part here even if your mother has been
[1:15:21] here for 20 years
[1:15:25] it is for her sister
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:30] now that her children have come back
[1:15:33] please
[1:15:39] because it's a family business
[1:15:42] so we see here about a family business
[1:15:48] there are three shareholders
[1:15:56] the father in
[1:15:59] not me
[1:16:00] Andy you
[1:16:02] in me anybody who is
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:12] these three
[1:16:13] who are the shareholders in this family
[1:16:16] business
[1:16:20] um if you run a company now company
[1:16:24] when it comes to the shareholders
[1:16:26] meeting
[1:16:28] they tell all the employees to go out
[1:16:31] looking
[1:16:34] because now it's a shareholder
[1:16:39] it's not for the workers
[1:16:42] even if you are working for the company
[1:16:43] for 20 years 40 years
[1:16:47] when they just declare shareholders
[1:16:49] meeting
[1:16:52] they want anyone who is not a
[1:16:54] shareholder to be out
[1:16:56] so we are here because we are
[1:16:59] shareholding inside there
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:05] we've got shares
[1:17:07] in the father through the Sun
[1:17:12] Hallelujah
[1:17:15] Hallelujah so when it comes to the
[1:17:18] shareholders
[1:17:19] they will tell you
[1:17:22] Moses came to tell us
[1:17:24] in the beginning
[1:17:27] God created
[1:17:29] Hallelujah that is Moses one of the
[1:17:33] shareholders
[1:17:37] Hallelujah
[1:17:40] amen amen
[1:17:44] Moses wrote the Book of Genesis
[1:17:48] yet Moses was born after Abraham
[1:17:53] but he was able to
[1:17:56] emotions he was there
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:03] then John oh remember let me ask let me
[1:18:07] go back a little bit
[1:18:09] the man who came to represent God
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:14] because
[1:18:17] the way God's character is
[1:18:20] Moses
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:24] so Moses could be speaking Swahili and
[1:18:29] somebody will be interpreting Swahili to
[1:18:31] the Swahili
[1:18:35] he was speaking Hebrew but they needed
[1:18:39] another Hebrew
[1:18:40] to interpret the Hebrew of Moses
[1:18:45] through the Hebrews
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:51] read the message books you find an and a
[1:18:56] white man
[1:18:57] speaking in white man's language but it
[1:19:00] has to be me and African to go and tell
[1:19:03] the white man what he meant
[1:19:10] if I go to America now I'll be telling
[1:19:12] them brother this year
[1:19:16] they cannot understand him
[1:19:18] so God speaks there a little
[1:19:23] but those who are in him
[1:19:26] they are able to connect all these
[1:19:32] these chairs inside there
[1:19:36] so when Moses said in the beginning was
[1:19:38] the uh God created
[1:19:46] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:51] he was not contravening Moses
[1:19:55] he was just telling us Moses
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:01] thank you
[1:20:04] Moses John
[1:20:08] let's go to the third one three foot
[1:20:12] then come Branham
[1:20:15] says
[1:20:17] before the beginning
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:34] happened already
[1:20:40] happened already
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:47] they loved us
[1:20:51] inside God
[1:20:57] because you cannot be in the Rapture
[1:21:01] unless you were already inside
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:10] for example let's take the beginning
[1:21:21] the heavens and the Earth
[1:21:24] but our beginning came
[1:21:27] when God said
[1:21:29] let there be light
[1:21:32] amen go to Genesis 1 1
[1:21:36] .
[1:21:39] foreign
[1:21:51] go ahead
[1:21:53] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:21:56] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:21:59] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:22:02] the face of the water not about that
[1:22:04] there was Darkness
[1:22:11] because it was the darkness which God
[1:22:15] didn't like
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] so what did he do
[1:22:24] Hallelujah
[1:22:33] what happened first if you can go to the
[1:22:37] book it is a rising of the sun says
[1:22:42] actually the light which you see today
[1:22:47] it is actually the word of God
[1:22:51] which had manifested
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] the scientist God can come now and say
[1:22:59] that's the sun it is this big it has got
[1:23:04] a nuclear fusion
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:08] professors are very bad at coming late
[1:23:21] they don't explain things which haven't
[1:23:23] happened
[1:23:27] professors who tell you things which
[1:23:29] have already happened
[1:23:33] you tell a professor
[1:23:35] that you know what there's an underworld
[1:23:41] he will protest
[1:23:43] but when it has already manifested
[1:23:52] it was like that
[1:23:55] after it has already happened
[1:24:00] they don't come before
[1:24:05] because
[1:24:06] before The Light Came
[1:24:10] we should have asked the professor how
[1:24:16] my brother or
[1:24:19] um it would be a frequency of this this
[1:24:23] until you don't even understand what
[1:24:26] they mean
[1:24:27] but when the sun came
[1:24:29] we never needed an explanation
[1:24:34] because we saw the sun
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:41] how many here went to school to know
[1:24:43] whether the son in a village
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:24:54] Hallelujah
[1:24:58] when the sun came
[1:25:00] even a building no there was a Sunday
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:16] so it was in the beginning
[1:25:19] but in the beginning
[1:25:21] uh Moses
[1:25:23] isn't it
[1:25:25] in the beginning the Lord created
[1:25:30] the world Hallelujah let's ask another
[1:25:33] shareholder
[1:25:35] what happened there
[1:25:38] come to Colossians 1. 12
[1:25:44] to 16.
[1:25:54] giving thanks unto the Father which has
[1:25:57] made us meet to be partaken of the
[1:26:00] inheritance of the Saints in life
[1:26:03] did you hear that
[1:26:06] who has made us to be shareholders
[1:26:14] giving thanks unto the father
[1:26:18] we have made us meet to be partakers
[1:26:23] of the inheritance of our sins in life
[1:26:28] ah in the light
[1:26:30] we are shareholders in the light
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:38] if you see the light there
[1:26:40] are my shares
[1:26:43] imagine
[1:26:47] you can say no because it's about you
[1:26:49] but for me I know
[1:26:54] Hallelujah yes my brother continue
[1:26:59] the power of darkness and have
[1:27:02] translated us
[1:27:03] into the kingdom of History remember
[1:27:06] where the darkness is coming from
[1:27:15] that darkness is still here
[1:27:23] is
[1:27:27] so he has driven us from Darkness
[1:27:30] the original thought yes come on my
[1:27:33] brother
[1:27:34] he turned us into the kingdom of his
[1:27:37] dear son Amen in whom
[1:27:39] Redemption through his blood even the
[1:27:42] forgiveness of sin
[1:27:44] who is the image of the invisible God
[1:27:47] the firstborn of every creature
[1:27:50] for by him were all things created that
[1:27:54] are in heaven and that are in Earth
[1:27:56] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:28:00] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:28:03] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:28:06] and for him Hallelujah
[1:28:11] who created
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:18] who created this
[1:28:23] for by him when all things created
[1:28:25] that are in heaven and that are in Earth
[1:28:28] disciple and invisible
[1:28:31] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:28:34] principalities or Powers all things were
[1:28:37] created by Him amen and for him
[1:28:41] Hallelujah because if he was saying you
[1:28:45] hear that brother balam tells you
[1:28:47] yeah it was not what Moses said the Lord
[1:28:51] created but verbalam tells us it was it
[1:28:54] was the logos
[1:28:57] praying on the doorstep of the father
[1:29:00] creating everything
[1:29:05] Hallelujah
[1:29:07] inside the logos
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:24] I come back to my remembrance when I I
[1:29:27] was the Lord was created one brother uh

[1:29:40] creation was happening

[1:30:11] of people

[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:14] there was all of us
[1:31:24] when Christ went to the cross
[1:31:27] I was there inside

[1:31:35] when class defeated the devil
[1:31:39] I was there

[1:31:47] do you think that I went to school to
[1:31:50] how to to to to defeat the Devil
[1:31:55] it's inside the meat I know
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:02] have you seen these young people who
[1:32:04] have come all the way from Zambia Zambia
[1:32:09] defeating the Devils
[1:32:12] regardless of how many women can undress
[1:32:16] for them they have made in their minds
[1:32:19] devil we know your tricks
[1:32:22] because we saw you there
[1:32:26] so the devil can't treat them
[1:32:32] you know our young people are having
[1:32:34] much victories
[1:32:38] because they're passing through the
[1:32:40] hardest times
[1:32:42] but I'm telling young people
[1:32:50] amen so now uh
[1:32:54] Moses Musa he said the Lord
[1:33:03] but if you go back to Genesis
[1:33:06] we will see the reason let's go back to
[1:33:09] Genesis
[1:33:15] let's go back there
[1:33:22] five two five billion yes and this is
[1:33:26] two five yes just wait for me a little
[1:33:29] bit with me yes
[1:33:32] yeah I want that one
[1:33:34] and every plant of the field before it
[1:33:37] was in the f
[1:33:39] and every half of the film before it
[1:33:41] grew for the Lord God has not caused it
[1:33:44] to rain upon the Earth and there was not
[1:33:47] a man to tell the ground hallelujah
[1:33:49] hallelujah
[1:33:51] foreign
[1:34:06] but now there has to be
[1:34:08] a man two
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:14] so uh no no don't don't demean a man you
[1:34:19] know
[1:34:20] if I was working in uh
[1:34:23] a in Boeing where they manufacture
[1:34:25] planes amen
[1:34:30] uh even if my work was just to clean the
[1:34:34] plane
[1:34:36] I'm a manufacturer
[1:34:43] I'm a manufacturer
[1:34:45] when I'm coming from home I tell people
[1:34:49] where do you work
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:56] princess
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:10] so man here to
[1:35:14] take care of
[1:35:16] all the things which who had already
[1:35:18] been created
[1:35:19] but before they were created
[1:35:22] they were created for him
[1:35:27] the creation was for man
[1:35:32] Hallelujah
[1:35:34] so man came
[1:35:36] to do the work so that is why
[1:35:40] God took a backseat
[1:35:44] man was busy
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:49] God says
[1:36:01] who was speaking
[1:36:07] Hallelujah so you can see these three
[1:36:11] four which the past has been talking
[1:36:12] about
[1:36:14] it's all over the Bible
[1:36:19] there is always a part for man to be
[1:36:22] there
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:29] so the the world was lying in darkness
[1:36:34] the Lord said let there be light
[1:36:40] this uh that's a message uh it is rising
[1:36:43] of the Sun
[1:36:44] the first light
[1:36:47] of the date it is
[1:36:56] God's spoken words
[1:37:03] be careful of the spoken word
[1:37:10] the first light
[1:37:12] the light no is the word
[1:37:17] [Applause]
[1:37:21] so God cannot speak like the way I speak
[1:37:25] myself
[1:37:28] uh you know when I eat a lot of uh
[1:37:31] potatoes I start speaking things
[1:37:40] you know when you are too full
[1:37:45] you can tell your wife I will never eat
[1:37:47] again
[1:37:51] because you are too full
[1:37:54] but God
[1:37:56] like that
[1:38:01] there is a purpose
[1:38:05] wait until the purpose is fulfilled
[1:38:12] don't do things
[1:38:14] before you see the purpose of God
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:29] amen
[1:38:31] because the light came for a purpose
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:40] so when the sun came
[1:38:43] spreading its lays
[1:38:47] inside the soil there was
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:00] there was a seat
[1:39:03] when that light now hit that seed
[1:39:08] it starts to rejoice
[1:39:14] what happened to the seed
[1:39:18] when the light
[1:39:21] came to the seeds
[1:39:26] started rejoicing
[1:39:30] amen can I have some water
[1:39:38] amen no don't worry I'll do something
[1:39:40] just now
[1:39:42] um
[1:39:44] those who know
[1:39:46] Hallelujah
[1:39:49] um
[1:39:50] don't worry I've got something
[1:39:52] yeah
[1:39:57] if I put that one in that means I'm not
[1:39:59] stop speaking so just get
[1:40:01] um
[1:40:03] just get used to the speaking now
[1:40:06] so when the sun came
[1:40:12] the sun came
[1:40:14] when a light comes
[1:40:21] you know when the light came
[1:40:27] the birds
[1:40:28] start singing
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:39] what happened to the father
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] cockroached back into the darkness
[1:40:56] when a light comes
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] just go into your kitchen
[1:41:07] put on the light
[1:41:10] even baby cockroaches
[1:41:13] the way they will run away
[1:41:16] because in their company
[1:41:20] they told each other
[1:41:23] once you see life
[1:41:25] it's Danger
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:37] if you see the seals being revealed
[1:41:52] it is
[1:41:54] against their
[1:41:57] tradition
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:41:59] they would want to remain in darkness
