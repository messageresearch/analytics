come here at home how she he loved her little did we know will be here tonight for the memorial of our sister the family was looking up to her today the only thing we can say this is the will of God amen amen and the word of God will bring consolation on us so I'm saying M all may God give you word of comfort because he knows better amen amen he is the only absolute of our life amen amen so without the wasting of time we will just have a moment for the waight and then we continue tomorrow yes we'll take few minutes we go to rest and come back amen amen before we read we just bow ahead and pray Heavenly Father you know better as as human being we may go to a certain extent but beyond that is up to thee Lord God may you condescend this evening and bring that divine intervention Heavenly Father you know the desire of our heart may you comfort the family because you are the only one that can do that as a human beings we may give weight but if they don't touch their heart heart that will be in vain Lord God bless each and every individual this evening the one that have attended the memorial service heavenly father as we are going to read a portion of the scripture we know Lord God many books we read from the universities and so forth but this is the only book that is stand for Eternal Lord God may you bless the word as we're going to read this evening as we put all unto your capable hand in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen we are going to read from the book of John chapter 18 18 verse 4 to8 ver 8 amen amen wanting to tell you again that our pastor isra in m is the one that said we must come here to comfort the family if it was possible he was going to here but due to some reasons beyond our control we are here on his behalf may God richly bless him as well and the entire church one of the reason we are using two languages here English and SP is because we have international viewers we have another National people that does not know at least English they can hear so do not be surprised speaking in English because only of that reason please bear with us for only will be well God bless you amen amen yes Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye they answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said unto them I am he and Judas also which betrayed him stood with them as soon as then as he had said unto them I am he they went backward and fell to the ground then asked them again whom seek ye and they said Jesus of Nazareth Jesus answered I have told you that I am he if therefore you seek me let this go their way amen amen you may be seated amen I want to share with you tonight about life beyond the grave amen amen because there is life beyond death what pain us is that we won't see The Departed again in a caral body and that bring an inward pain to us but the real life the spiritual life the real life is the life beyond the grave because that life is life eternal amen amen the one we have today is life temporal and the word of God teaches us that everything everything that you can see with your Naked Eyes is temporal maybe a car maybe a house maybe clothes maybe your body because you can see it with a naked eye it's temporal one of the days it will come to an end but if we can look at the life beyond the grave that's what we are longing for amen amen I for one I wake far from from my home I normally go home on weekends and normally when I leave my house my my my wife doesn't like something that I normally say I will normally say I will see you if I still come alive then he will say no we must go into the Rapture and we are all waiting for the Rapture but if the rapture tiries and death took me that's what I mean so whatever we are doing whenever we are going waiting for the Rapture but no death death is always next to us any time you can go amen amen that's that is the world we are living in I used to scare death but time goes by I start to realize who am I I start to to preach and look Beyond I start to realize that there is good life beyond the grave and that's what we want but the reason why we fear death sometimes in life we are very much unsure if you can close your eyes and imagine what will happen when you die you will fear death because you just see blank maybe you just see Darkness maybe you don't know whether you're going to make it to heaven and you start doing introspection you started looking whether I should die or not that's why when you survive in an accident you even give testimony because you don't want to die amen amen and that's natural are human beings even our Lord Jesus Christ he has to face death came here on Earth knowing that one of the days what happened before the foundation of the world should manifest and should manifest in him and he must die and die for us amen amen but one day when he fac death it was not easy he even say if it was possible this can pass but it was not possible that should happen because it's a God for ordained thing amen amen now here when he was facing death you know meeting this soldiers he asked them whom are you looking for when they say Jesus then he said here am I and they fell down amen amen definitely if it was me there I was going to run away and even give a testimony in the church that the soldiers were here I just say I am and fall I Walk Tall part of Jesus knew that his day has arrived because the the Bible says this day this scripture is fulfilled amen amen then he had to switch off that Heavenly power so that he may come to the level of the lamp Jesus was God but he was a lamp as well when he was God the soldiers fell when he is the lamb and they catch him was the Lamb of God he may be crucified for our sins forgiven was the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen then everybody that can see him they were feeling for him even Mary said for his son that he is going he will never come back alive L you know that after 3 days he will come back again he was God he can switch on the power and S of the power again so he allowed them to hold him Andy him amen amen but the devil the devil is short shortsighted he thought when he killed Jesus was the end of him only to find out that is the beginning of things amen amen because after the death of Jesus Christ that's where you and me came out of him and became the bride amen where they pierced him there of Jesus amen amen and from there on there are lot of activities many and many happen beyond the grave amen amen before the grave he was a young man at the age of 33 but beyond the grave he was called The Almighty the creator of Heaven and Earth that was our Lord Jesus Christ when he changed the mask God of being the Lamb of being a man and so on and so on amen amen now these soldiers if they were normal when somebody says who are you looking for and they they fell they could have run away to see the power men have amen but they stood off their clothes and still want to they don't know what is next allowed them lamp should be slain so that scripture should be fulfilled the lamp was slain the found amen amen so now you know when death come where where where I'm working side of lightting there were three young men the local you know yes so I was addressing them and they threatened me and even to kill me they they even wanted to kill me amen amen because when you come to an area having some project then you find the local community they have their representative they whatever they wanted to talk they come to me and they want to impose some of the things and they say you don't know us you don't know the area you don't know how to do things and you must pass up then I said to them you are still young uh you'll know me as time goes by I used to fear death but now I'm not scared of death if you kill me it's okay but sooner or later you will die as well to kill someone is not a solution then I said to them you are still young as you grow you understand then as we go and work and work and work they came to me they said we have met people but there was none like you you are so powerful there's a light in you always even if we have realized that when you are not at work things are not going right here so we need you always here we really apologize what we have said about you of you that other day we have realized that you are the men we need here then I said to them I told you even one amongst them poison me poisoned me in my food so that I can he came to me and tell me that he tried but I'm untable then I said well I was not aware of that and it brought the the confirmation to them this is something that we do not have and I can't tell you that those three young boys were SAS all of them they this R and white amen so they were testing how powerful their things can work just like these ones when they wanted to hold Jesus Christ and crucify him there are forces today that are from God that are from the devil and as we goes by they test each other amen amen it's something that you cannot deny something that we are working on on a daily basis the world we are living in is a No Man's Land there should be a force control you to do something that you do not even like we see Judas selling Jesus Christ pieces he didn't like it he was a friend to Jesus he was one of the disciples but there was a for overpowered him to commit what he did to our Lord Jus amen amen if you can find Judas and ask him he will tell you this I didn't want to do that but something said to me I must do this I must sell Jesus Christ because there's a force that is always coming to you let's read what brother Bram says he said we have a body and the body is a flesh and that flesh one of the day was rought but it was born by the sexual desire of a father and a mother and it must rot it's not good therefore the New Birth the the resurrection when you brought forth again in a new body it will be God creative power that he speak like he did to Adam come forth you know this flesh it can't help it it's temporal you need the spirit you need the soul to control the Flesh and when the spirit is controlling the flesh the flesh give way amen amen and then we have a soul a soul being the nature of the spirit and the soul is the one that God need and the soul is the something that the devil needs and from the soul if you controlled by the devil you want to help it but you do what the devil says You must do but from the soul if you believe God God there you can't help it when you try to do wrong God put you to do right amen that is from the soul being the controlling Tower of your life so beyond death we see the active Soul the Bible says when Jesus died on the cross remember they hold him they crucify him and they they they even have some dice to win his and the devil was happy and it was the end of him only to find that was the beginning of him now Beyond Death this is what happened us before the grave we see his body in the grave but beyond the grave the Bible says his Spirit went back to God but his soul went to the lower part of the world why going there the Bible says to preach to the lost soul the ones that did not believe the word of God during the time of Noah during the time of L during the old anti duilian ages he went there to preach to them not for the repentance but to tell them then for deny Noah you deny me that was the thing says that was the third pool thir pool is when you preach the message to the doomed not for the repentance but just a confirmation and in this last age see the message from the pull pit bring judgment to the people if you believe you are saved if you disbelieve you are damned so the message is not coming to bring the neutral position coming to show you who you are those that believe to believe those that deny deny the message is the light and in the light things are clear the light does not change things but the light made things to be more visible how are you going to take it if the wolf is preaching to the Sheep telling them that when you vote for me I will become a vegetarian and the Sheep will say p p but when they say p p if they were 100 now they are 80 all of a sudden they are 50 all of a sudden the you know the craw is empty amen amen the condition does not change who you are in the beginning God knew our destination knew we will be here you know as human beings we must just come to a realization accepting what God is doing among us there are certain condition certain situation in life you cannot change amen amen so the best thing we can do is just to say Lord God you know better amen I know here he he wanted she wanted one of the days that sister bu him because naturally the elderly people as you age you come you you approach your departure and even in the Bible it says the old people in the Bible used to say we lived until this far they even ask God for now take us back home because we liveed and this life can give it to our children to continue amen am that that's natural but to bury your own children is something that is not good at all but who knows is God himself and why and there was a purpose that one of the days we will know better we will see better so God has prepared everything the way he wanted them from the beginning there's two things that you do not know about yourself the day you are born and the day you will depart but that is the secret that God has put in him that you were born in so date you will depart in so date is God knows and is the circumstance is the circumstance you cannot change let me continue with brother here he said is a question and answers they were asking this question about the difference between the body the spirit and the you know the soul he said job said I'll have a desire he speak and I will answer him see now the body is what you looking at the spirit is what controls you your soul is the motive of that Spirit or the nature of that Spirit the soul that sinth shall die amen amen you you are born in the world with a sinful soul that is the nature of your spirit it's sinful when you were born in this world you long for the things of the world then the Holy Ghost comes down and baptize you and changes the nature of that Spirit the nature of that Spirit that's left on you is of Heaven amen amen when you were born the nature was of sinful but when the Holy Ghost come bapti you all those things now your nature change becomes the nature of Heaven amen then you profess amen am that you are a pilgrim and a stranger then you are born from above then you are from above you are a candidate of Heaven you are a new creature in Christ Jesus with the same body with the same Spirit only is changed you know when we live he Chang me day by day little by little until we come to a St of a perfect man amen amen the life you live is the life you lived that life you lived you are living it today and is a life you're going to live in future because life eternal it's God's life God is eternal our pastor normally tells us that we were process from him if he is the life eternal we are the life eternal we are the word ourselves for God is the word himself amen amen I want us to read this scripture here H first Peter or before first Peter it will be my last scripture here on Ephesus chapter chapter 4 we will read verse 8 to9 Ephesians chap 4: 8 to9 wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth verse n yes why uh and and and to make all men see what is the fellowshipping of the mystery which from the beginning of the world uh have been laid in God who created All Things by Christ do you read until no yes okay amen amen so this is what happen beyond the grave when Jesus was died on the cross said his body was in the grave his soul Spirit went back to God his soul went to preach the lower world he preached to them that disb believe the word of God after preaching to them he ascended when he Ascend he went back to heaven with these Saints from that time we started to see two different places when somebody dies the soul that sin when it dies spiritually it goes lower when the soul that saved God beyond the grave goes up to God amen amen amen amen that's the message I love to pre bring tonight A Life Beyond Death you know when death come and you you pass you go beyond it's either you go down or you go up it's a it's a situation you as a person you cannot change that is why the Bible says we must always be ready for our Lord is coming am amen amen let's read the last scripture I was talking about in First Peter 3 18 2 18-21 for Christ also had once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but but quickened by the Spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when Once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing while the ark was a preparing werein few that his eight Souls were saved by water the like figure were un where unto even bapt baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer by the answer of a good conscience towards God by by the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen amen do you see that our Lord Jesus Christ when he died on the cross thinking is the end of him thinking is the end of him the people thinking that it was the end of him but beyond death he was more active than when he was here on Earth because he preached to the lost soul after preaching to the lost soul he went up with his children and put them under the altar amen amen that's what he did and by creating those two parts The Fifth Dimension and the sixth Dimension is a channel is a channel for us when we depart either you go down or you go up and those that go up they are under the altar they comfort from God for he is their father God whom you worship is the one that came down here and himself indwell himself amongst us amen amen when you Worship You Worship in truth you worship knowing your destination every time he whispers those weight in you he always give you the direction that is why as a child of God we are fearless we are no longer scared of death if death comes is the one that take us back to him taking us back to the original position we are not always amen said amen we we we always look up to him God gives you another day gives you another year you just than thank you if he decide to take you say Thank You Lord amen amen the most happiest people on Earth should be the children of God because you know better you know why things are happening that way some of the things we don't know at that moment but beyond that moment we started to see things better we started to know things better amen amen because he never forsaken us I was saying it was the last scripture but here is my last scripture in Acts chapter one because we read the one that is taking him down but I want to read you the one that is taking him up when you read Acts chapter one 1 uh verse 2- 4 2 to 4 it until the day in which he was taken up after that he he threw the Holy Ghost had given had given Commandments unto the Apostle whom he had chosen amen and then you yeah 2 to 4 to whom also he showed himself alive after his after his H after his Passion by many infallible proofs amen being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them and commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which sayith he ye have had of me amen amen 9 to 10 9 to 10 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and what what heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel amen amen you see here I'm just trying to show you that beyond the grave he went down to preach for those people that they disbelieve the word of God and they will never repent but after three days he came and the the people there in Jerusalem they started to see the one that you know died times back for 40 days and then Jesus Christ when he Ascend he ascended with them the people were looking it was a miracle he even said to his disciples the moment you see me going the very same pattern is the pattern that I will come back with amen amen for many years passed by when many years passed in 1963 because he went up with the cloud he came back with the cloud so we are the witness of them if they have raptured with the cloud going up the cloud came we shall rur in that cloud because the cloud from the pyramid and the pyramid is the bride being kept by our Lord Jesus Christ you know when we preach about the seven Church ages the bride the Seven Seals Christ himself coming down his church as we are one so sooner or later in a twinkle of an eye because the constellation is complete we will go we walk waiting for the Rapture but the time of depart come so be it we accept it is the way God wants us back home and for us to depart is to show the people that those that will Rapture will see us up and then we go together when a Christian depart is not a loss but in God because we rely in God but when we are shorted shorted even if somebody is greeting you you say what shall we say because we experience death amen amen we we know the pain that we end when someone depart but the word of God is there for the consolation it should be the one that puts you in your position so that tomorrow you can comfort as us there are certain things that we are going through so that other people may learn from them what you are going through you be able to explain to someone tomorrow what you are going through what you are going through I went through it this is how I overcame we should be there for one another our God is a good planner he he knows the other kids you know depart at the premature age the other one the elderly people the other ones at the middle age the other ones their youthful age but whom to blame amen amen no one to be blamed God knows better of what will happen about our lives the best we are we can do as I was always saying as I said previously just be a good follower just follow God just be a good listener just listen to the word of God you know when you are living in this world amen amen you know when we started we start working there we we we start with a prayer in the morning then they normally ask me to pray and when when I pray there's something that I mentioned then we are with the engineers managers Le people but I said in my prayer Lord God we are here to work and our intelligence and the wisdom go to a certain extent where our intelligence is stop that's where you must take us a little bit amen amen when I say amen amen see those white people look at man it seems like he's belittling our intelligence a man temporal you like it or not in your body you can love the way you love it and do everything but it's temporal amen amen we we we we you know like people like myself you start eating the L they say you gain weight it's temporal one of the days it will go go back where it belongs it belongs to the soil it will go back to the soul but there a real you in this body your soul that soul is a the that soul is God himself because is processed from God that soul is the am God that soul is the one that will inherit in heaven amen and that soul is the one that behold the face of the father if your soul is right with God fear not death you you just walk that is why as I was saying every day always I don't know what will happen tomorrow but if you hear me I'm dead know that I'm dead there's nothing you can do you don't know when you are going to depart but only God knows when we go we go preparing our lives that we should not be ashamed for him because he was never ashamed to die for us at the cross he was put there in public telling the whole world and the Devil Himself that today by die on the cross I marry my bride can I tell you something when he died on the cross he was dying for you not everyone people can preach and say he died for us in the cross he was dying at the cross for the specific people not the whole L amen amen that's how the word of God is is because he came for us we are here for him we are in a mission we are so and strangers going back home you know the reason why God brought us here on Earth he just wants to show the world the devil that I am God amen amen there was a war in heaven I defeated you you come here I defeated you at the right time I go back to God as more conqueror amen amen we were conqueror but now we are more than conqueror amen amen so Saints for tonight we will stop here we will continue tomorrow and bury the remaining of our sister may family be comforted they are Christian they know better they must know that when you believe the word of God he has never disappointed he knows everything about us let's continue worshiping always there for us amen amen let's
