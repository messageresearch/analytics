Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol 3.
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-November 05 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scripture: 
Revelation 8:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the end of the Seventh Seal.
We are not waiting for the Seventh Seal to be opened, we are now at the end of the Seventh Seal. 
God has chosen us before the foundation of any church and we should not belong to any Church but in Christ.
The real preacher that we know is the one who preaches to the Theophany.  You are what the Word of God is. What you have heard made you to be who you are. The word comes to the people who were chosen before. 

The people who are going into the Rapture are not waiting for a preaching on the rapture, because it is in them. Enoch knew that the rapture is coming and he started to walk. 

The Theophanies are the people who are not of this world. The message now speaks about the bride in their spiritual positions. What the preacher brings should be that which we have heard and seen from the beginning. 

When you are a child of God , you are a being of eternity, a being of eternity is not continuously told to do this or not do that, once they catch the word it will live within them. 
The Seventh Seal closes time. The Church age is time and Seals is not time. 
We are at the end time, which is the opening of the Seals. 

The church is of God and it must be started by God, not by a person who has few quotes and thinks of starting the church. 


The pastor quoted the following spoken words:
64-0802 The Future Home Par 205
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 304

our elders ourons everybody here for a few minutes okay let's turn to that scripture when he opened you know there are some people that are getting along with God because when he opens he opens because he's opening for some people that's why John was summoned [Music] up come up [Music] from yes amen so that's why we are we are now beyond the CH the ages uh the the bride the audience is the theop uh it should be the reaing of the and the message is very very special because it started before amen God bless God bless you amen Revelation 8 verse one brother if sometimes not AUD enough indicate that I am not audible to everybody okay Revelation 8 verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father amen it's so wonderful to come in your presence saying this is the first day of the week as your Prophet taught me that on the first day of the week we go for nothing else Hallelujah but to assemble for that is the day of Resurrection if somebody thinks of doing something on that day he Dishonored God because that is the day of Resurrection amen that's why we were up this early morning amen and uh I just went for the books because it was early in the morning on the Resurrection Day am and early in the the morning yes we think of nothing else so I just went for the books saying Lord speak to us it's so wonderful to spend a day having heard the voice of God let it be the first thing to greet you in the morning so that's why we are glad to come here for to share with the theop of God the word that was there before the foundation of the world Hallelujah the people the holy people of God so we are here Lord bless us bless our souls amen bless this children that are targeted in our day and even the people who actually are there are responsible for targeting this children we we do not Wonder because the Lord Jesus [Music] himself he was called by some kinds of names just for being holy and we know that it was Satan even Satan today is calling us Bal but we know our God We Shall Serve him no matter what the world say no matter what Satan say we are here to worship Him He said I shall build my church and the gates of Hades shall never Prevail never never over it the gates help us Lord after reading this word you are our spokesman yes sir H even this morning as we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated God bless you amen amen and when he open the seventh it was silent in heaven now the brother says after this this reading this scripture you must keep quiet amen amen um I'm I've got the very same thing the end of the seventh season you remember last week we read from a future home which is a book uh for the bride talking about the future home and you know the prophet of God T to me that the New Jerusalem is shaped like a pyramid and I said amen then he said the bride of Christ is shaped by like the city and I said Amen to that so now we were reading last uh which it can take us the whole day just reading from this part here where it says where are you going now when you are born you are born for a journey did you know that so that's why uh the prophet of God asked a question where are you going why are you going from here that is the question okay you know uh we are in another generation can search for books then books for back then amen amen then you find there were great men soall great men but if I ask you a question where are they okay amen uh but there was one amongst them the Lord Jesus Christ before this name was given to him I mean here on Earth Jesus uhhuh amen that's why we come this morning no matter what the world says Satan is trying to destroy this church did you know that day and night he is trying to destroy it can you destroy no that's why we we will worship him because we started there is no starting it says for before the foundation of the world he has chosen us not in a church in him now if we were chosen in him surely even this morning we are in here and even billions and billions if they were a billion years still be in plus with himen that's why I can say to Satan you can say what you want Jesus is Lord we shall worship you now I'm looking at this H we were here last week looking at this scriptures because H I have because of the activities morning I have chopped a certain time amen I was supposed to be here what time at this time but I came afterwards all right amen so the seventh seal when it was open open I shall not I shall repeat that not preached no when it was [Music] opened actually no one the only preacher I knew is the one who preached to the theop now the ministry of the theop they didn't start in 19 so and [Music] so it was not yet called a church when it was in him before we were given a form put into this amen natural form which shall pass away this body if it has got no soul it carries the mission of Satan amen amen but if the person that is in that body came from God and it is a theop will come maybe you don't understand the what it is so the seals you know there preaching everybody can take a stage but when we I I come to talk about God and the what you are going to hear is something you have heard and what do have here made you you are what the word of God Isen so the word is preached to the people that are the way because amen means amen so be it that's why I was looking for that moment when we will hear the word of God and we shall not remain with questions because it says I have chosen you before now if you were chosen before that means when the word comes it comes to the people who were chosen before because they have no question that word comes and they are that word now manifested that's right we don't need Bible school we need predestination now I will read few things and that will be it okay amen and you know we are not in competition with another church or churches no the Lord Jesus he was not in competition he was the Lord the Messiah amen The Great I Am yesterday today and forever now if you are his child you become yesterday today and forever you know that's why he says as he has chosen you when before there was the world he has chosen you and it says you are not of the world the world don't know you but it knew him not in order it means for the world to know you it's only if it has known that's why uh we remain what does that say the song victorious victorious the river Euphrates is dry I was showing the children of God they were at my house there and I said hey this morning I've seen something uh I went through the YouTube and looking at the sence the days of Noah in YouTube carries the days of it is [Music] displaying the days of Noah is happening exactly for the Lord says when ask about his coming he said as it was the days and now we see it the days of Noah now if you take the days of Noah then you've got to position Abraham where where were Abraham in the days of no can you realize that Abraham when he looked he saw smoke coming up and brother say church church uh was the same amen amen somebody was listening when I preached last time and I mention uh this uh fly then she also mentioned that that is now talking about flying what El okay but it helps me because one day I will talk about it redeem from the spoken word there things that are happening okay now we looked at it last time that once you hit seven then it says and now where are you going since the seventh since he opened the servant where are you going all right amen I'm going to read again H page 27 here the future home a future home future home is a home that we going to occupy we are going to our home no matter what Satan says because it is the ministry of the homegoing church the real church today the one that is going we are not praying for a Revival to come revivals they came but this time it's not Revival amen am we are going back to our home that's all amen everything what you you need it's ahead it's just here around the corner I don't know how many believe the Rapture the rupture at this stage is not something that I can try to teach you because it is something that is already in the people that are going in the RT it's already there all right amen uh when Enoch walked with God he didn't need any teaching a walk with God because it was where in him so you can teach somebody something that is already in because the next if it is in you it is called the manifestation amen amen I don't believe that the people that are going in the Rapture are waiting for the Rapture teaching because he already there in them they are being raptured they are walking like like Elijah who started the journey because the Chariot was coming and he knew that the Chariot is coming what is wonderful about God [Music] Elijah when he started to walk it's after he has seen the coming Chariot and he knew that the Chariot is coming then he started to walk towards the station St he knew where it would come that was Elijah en knew already that the Rapture his Rapture is coming he started to work towards [Music] that amen amen now it was no it was not no longer a preaching but it was a manifestation why are you going Enoch I'm going to be taken Elijah where are you going The Chariot is coming and you I mean the where are you going do you see any future apart from the coming rapture which future are you looking at amen amen uh we are working on Israel we are looking at the events and we have our brother overseas we are waiting together with him and we going to I and some people think that he's not working no he's looking for a job he's fixing his things so that he can go to if employed he will be employed because even while working uh he will still be able to help his computer is not just for BCC Y no it is there my home I don't know whether it is his or mine uh do I have a computer can I computer yeah yeah do I have one yeah yeah so but I don't use computer but I use it in this way that the brother comes and uh he finds things for me and for brother gabrielson we are busy with those things amen amen h i don't have computer computer I don't know whether I should be ashamed of this or not that I don't I don't know computer the worst part of it I don't even know my cell phone yes I'm I'm telling you the truth before God I can't use my own cell phone I don't know not that I don't want to but I just find myself in that world okay but God made it possible for me to have a person or people uh who will help me with this computer cell phone I don't know why I know I I can't operate them I don't know them all right I didn't say computer is wrong phone I have them but I need [Music] somebody to guide somebody in [Music] the in the book of Amen yes yes amen he says I read one who can come and interpret and was it Philip H Phillip Philip came when did that man from Jerusalem was on his chariot now because he was part of God when then uh in his heart there was a desire you know like we children of God when we read we want to know what are we reading about but all everybody that is predestinated he doesn't just read for the sake of reading that is part if you are part of the Bible you will read exactly you'll see your part listen the future home let me read to the people that are homegoing okay amen because it says I repeat brother Ben what are you going to do now you've run out of your complete s if I don't understand a thing and God has provided me amen amen it says you have run out of complete [Music] seven seven Church ages they run out to seven and from there where are you going if then somebody says you know I have studied the seven Church ages up to the seventh then you will say and now where are you going because seven Church ages seven Church ages is [Music] ages is of the it's ages it's time Age come another AG come because it is time but the prophet only let us go beyond Hallelujah beyond [Music] what the kitten of time in your SS book he says let us now I believe that if a prophet of God comes to me and say let's go beyond the seven age time let's go beyond how do I go beyond the prophet will never say that to me unless he knows me amen God knows where you going to end up that's why he will give you if you are you have eternal life he will send you and give you a [Music] message nonstop it's not just a mer go around it's from there to so I said come up and I'll show you things to come you can't just remain without seeing things to come a person who comes to church here is a person expecting you know when we come we don't come to repeat something we are on our way from this to that from that to that until you end up in the New Jerusalem not looking back that's why we should be if it's a church we should be a church church that's not looking back it depends where you are this morning you know it goes with I was also in church yes you were in church but where were you yeah you are in church but way because it's something that is moving that coming from church you you you'll testify because every service you [Applause] somewhere otherwise you be become a church goer and you'll still do the things that you do but yet still going to church but going nowhere I'm going to finish soon brother I don't have my watch don't worry I think okay amen am I preaching or talking preaching Pastor oh then let's read you have run out of servants where are you going even this morning I can say to you since you started to worship coming here every Sunday now today is the first day again but where are you going am or you just a a church goer you know the real real message every day are shifting it's not just talking it's life all right now let me read this and finish you have run out of your complete service if I go now to this H the prophet calls it the end of the seventh seal okay amen now when you arrive there which is the end of the seventh SE uh can you go back to the church ages The Church Must come to where it is beyond love one another love one another don't smoke you young men with the girls in yourself no you can't preach to such people if you come to seven then you live in the seven Church ages now in the church ages you find twins in the church each Church ageed TS now no wonder in the church sometimes there shall come a preacher now I know today even if I can say young those things in your C you know that it won help because they are not in the cell phone they are in his heart that's the the thing so if the heart was not converted then the ministry will remain in the cell phone each and every one of us today has a Ministry that he follows one the min Ministry is in Christ another one the ministry is in the cell phone I have I think three cell phones we we use them to for communicate to communicate and so forth yeah many times is used is used by my brother there to in helping me to receive mine actually is the brother who uses a lot to assist me it's like that all right amen we have so many Ministries in this world C phone is a Ministry but we have sons of God here they use it for communication to talk to the people no problem but some people is something else and in other one they say they charting you are talking to a person He will draw his cell phone then he can no longer hear you let me talk to the the the people who are not of this world amen amen they were born in je seon because they were predestinated to appear in this season to manifest the word of God as he says for as we were chosen in him when now you can ask a person when did you uh believed know last year amen amen uh that's just a human language but the Bible says before the foundation you were in him amen no Ministry is going to to put you in him that's right because you were [Music] in now we are just talking about the restoration the manifestation because you were already in him before there was sin before there was church you were in him it's a great [Music] thing amen amen uh you won't I won't be struggling with the people M I mean let me put it in this way amen the you take [Music] sheep grass amen you know they are you maybe every Sunday preach to them don't forget to Grace I mean to eat grass any other no it is its nature now Peter says he has given us divine nature there's a time when you will not hear gospel a gopel don't steal don't goip don't hate you know I think we have entered that [Music] area this you will come and read how the ministry of Christ changed from this to that even us um if you need to remind me every day that I should not hate I should not steal I should not that's you preaching to me that but it won't help me if I was not chosen in him before it says before the foundation of the world did you know to say to preach to me saying thou shall not do this and that and that you know it won help me if I was not chosen in him because this is the time of the [Music] manifestation you will only manifest that which is in you and what you are made to be I I believe we are together you know the bride of Christ you can't preach to the bride of Christ don't steal don't hate can that be preached to the Bri the bride is the manifestation of the word of God it is what God has already done they were predestinated to be holy you see today there are people uh to whom Holiness was preached Hol still been preached Holiness today that is not the bread of Christ if you turn around and say thou shall not steal thou shall not do this that's not to the bride of Christ of Christ has done past the that's why we are talking about the end of the seventh SE amen amen it doesn't apply if it is not to their predestinated okay amen H I read this part we read this last week saying where are you where are you going all right even now from this service where are you going appoint already appointment after service meet at the station after the service a person like if on the first day the Resurrection Day youde you decide to do something that is not in line with the resurrection you are [Music] offline you disrespect all right amen for few minutes page 562 it tells us something like this did I say 562 all right let me read this part um he start by saying and this is the third pool coming up then I come to this part it says uh let me find it first you notice now for the End of Time message this seal after all she has revealed all six seals but he don't say nothing about the servant and the end time SE amen amen he says nothing about the end time see when the time ends like we you take seven churches you come to the seventh and where are you going after you hit the seventh Church age where are you going are you going back to the churches again no that's why I can't say to you uh if I have known you very well I say to you Church age and start with the first church age then I would not be knowing you the real Supernatural [Music] preaching it goes with the place the people are amen the the message now about the Bri and where the bright is at the I'm talking about the spiritual position if God when God speaks he looks at who he is because the predestinated is in line with God that's why when John start to preach he that which we did you know brother he doesn't say uh what was preached by now he applies to those who were there he says that which we we have heard and that which we have seen even next week if there will be next week if perhaps I can get engaged into something no I will ask one of the brothers here to preach why because to me he will say nothing else he will only say the thing I was going to say now this scripture let the scripture be in your heart that which was from the beginning that which we have not last week's Sunday but that which we have heard from when in the beginning was so we have received the word what we bring to you is what that which we have here amen amen not from the last Revival but from the beginning because the word was in the beginning we are not starting a new thing okay amen so that's why is that which we [Music] have and sin you must hear and the SE now after the seventh Church age it says come up and I who's talking I will show you things to come now John retaining from being up there he comes with what he has received from God not not from the church there's so many churches some teaching this some teaching this some denying this now we need the people who went beyond to preach to us the things he has seen the things he has seen amen because God won't preach to you a thing that you haven't seen amen that's why when he come in the pit that man now he says that which say it that which was from the beginning yeah which we [Music] have meaning that which was from the beginning we could hear it amen amen amen and if it is from the beginning it will it will only be received by those who were in the beginning you understand yeah I read this and close yeah come and see now from the seventh seal it said when he opened it I shall repat that when he preached no because it is revealed to you how long has it been preached or there's been preaching when I was young Boyer we were staying there by Robert height every Sunday morning those days you see mothering singing saying [Music] repent the of is near during those times now I'm old amen amen an amazing thing is that I am not old inside you know when a person is old he just received anything even if it's not a gospel him alone it is because he is old his old age those men of God [Music] coming with rations the more time goes they are returning back is the more they are going back the more they here on is they are actually going back that's why you could you couldn't find a a young Apostle or a boy amen amen so this this body this this Tabernacle this Tabernacle carries a being and if you are a child of God you are a being of Eternity a being of Eternity is not a person you can say rep do this do this no that's not eternity being of Eternity once he has received the word of [Music] gods with him amen amen you can't hold a meeting and say he is a being of I was taught we are not beings of we are coming back to this book it say let's end this H about the 7th and the end time SE the seven seal the seventh seal closes the time of all things now when it says when it starts will be absolutely a total secret now some people don't understand this thing about the secret secret ER between God and some other people it actually refers to God and other people all right amen Gabriel came with a secret to Mary and that word that Gabriel brought the prophet of God when he looked at it and found that that word when that word got to Mary it became yeah that word became blood in Mary's wom now I will I will come with that book next time to show you that when you say you have received the message is that word the word that came from God the real talk it's the word from God coming to a dwelling Mary was chosen as God's Vision to bring forth God in the body now firstly Mary was that Mary carried that body but that body was the word made flesh amen so the real message the real message to us was this word that came to us all right amen now in the now in you this time of the end of the seventh it's not a body like this body this is the Earth but now the secret now we'll read it is that the word that you have received is that body you are going to be raptured but you must receive a body for the Rapture you can't be raptured in flesh like this there must be a [Music] change because this body shall never be raptured one head your body this body shall never be raptured flesh and blood can never enter the body that will be repur it's not this body did you know that because Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God so says the Bible now are you ready to be changed do you have a body that body that will take you up in a twinkling of an eye it can be this body so the ministry of the seven SE is to give you a body a body that shall be in a twinkling of an ey you shall change hey Paul was God's is God's apost how did he see these things then we come to that the Redemption of the body he says we are waiting for the Redemption we have the Redemption of the soul to redeem is to take back amen amen but what we are waiting for now is to be changed okay brother are you ready to be changed or future or you still have future so know we can't change this suddenly because we have promises of increase at work and I was looking forward how do we change when I'm still waiting to build a big house for my children even when you you may even end up saying oh Lord can you delay this change because I have already received Amen theone to do this and this it's the people we are they longing for that as we are seated like this you know this morning I was so much longing for a change amen amen I will being joyful how many are longing for a change amen amen amen to leave this world and go back to our Eternal home I'm going to stop here but to resume next time at the end of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God would be known I want you to open I'm I'm closing but I want you to open your inner ear at the end of the seventh angel message all the mysteries of God would be known amen we are at the end of time the opening of the seventh seal we are at the end of the of we we're at the end time the opening of the seventh amen we are at the we are at the End of Time the opening of the seventh seal if then you are talking about time time was church ages age time but s is not [Music] ages okay amen now the Lord [Music] willing the Bible say don't just say tomorrow I'll do this next week I'll do this the Lord will now I stop here with this we are at the end of the opening now will you listen it doesn't say we are at the opening we are at the end time now when it is the end time then it is the opening of the seven SE amen amen okay amen then we'll take it further when if God if he ties then I I I I just want to stop here okay because we'll come to the notable one we are going to where it speaks of the angel with the seventh seal we going to bring the message from the Pyramid of the Angels then we will end up with the White Stone interpretation what it meant H he saw the Angels coming and because in the pyramid was now one can say to me there's people here the message is not preached it preached to the mama or brother can for the first time he entered this place this morning and it's for his first time who has called her the people are getting baptized to the very same message rejected by the by some people but one is coming from before the foundation of the world to that one the seventh the seventh was revealed otherwi otherwise he would not be here now building I'm not referring to the building he will not reach the place we are at the thing today if you see churches are scattering there new churches today everyone who can find
