[53:06] so you know I'm a brief speaker.

[53:18] So let's open our Bible
[53:22] in the book of Job
[53:26] chapter 14 verse 14-1 17. Job chapter
[53:32] 14.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, before we read,
[53:35] &gt;&gt; my brother can lead us in prayer. Amen.

[55:09] Amen.
[55:18] We pray your mercy upon him and everyone
[55:21] who here father
[55:24] through your servant this evening

[55:31] trusting and believing in the wonderful

[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We can read.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; We read the book of Job chapter 14 from
[55:43] verse 14 to 17.
[55:46] If a man die, shall he live again? All
[55:50] the days of my appointed time will I
[55:53] wait till my change come. Thou shalt
[55:57] call and I will answer thee. Thou will
[56:00] have a desire to the work of thine
[56:03] hands. For now thou numberest my steps.
[56:07] Dust thou not wash over my sin?
[56:11] My transgression is sealed up in a back
[56:14] and thou seest up mine iniquity.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So my title for the message this evening
[56:29] is about verse 14
[56:33] and it's a question.
[56:36] If a man die,
[56:38] shall he live again?
[56:41] Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; So uh you would remind me
[56:46] at the at the end of the sermon
[56:49] &gt;&gt; we must sing that song
[56:51] says
[56:53] amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh we we have the law of God
[57:00] and the law of signs.
[57:03] The law of signs
[57:06] says what goes up
[57:09] will come down. But the law of God says
[57:14] what came down will go up. In other
[57:18] words, it tells us that
[57:22] those that comes from God
[57:25] above will go back to God.
[57:29] We are always against
[57:32] the law of science
[57:34] and the things of the world because they
[57:37] have limitation
[57:39] but we go beyond the death
[57:42] and we normally say and I've seen
[57:45] brother said it as well here he say
[57:50] when a person is born
[57:52] we call it a sunrise
[57:56] when you depart But it's a sunset.
[58:01] And brother Brenham says as well, when
[58:03] the sun comes, it's a sunrise.
[58:07] When it goes down is a sunset, the sun
[58:11] is born and the sun will die.
[58:16] So I will show you the quote. When
[58:19] brother Brenham says all those things,
[58:23] well, you know, I said the other day
[58:27] that we need to look at the life of
[58:29] brother Brennan.
[58:32] It was not an easy life
[58:34] and do not expect an easy life.
[58:38] That is why the Bible says when we get
[58:41] there, we will be called more than
[58:45] conquerors.
[58:47] You cannot call
[58:50] more than a conqueror
[58:52] if you didn't have a battle to fight.
[58:56] Every piece of life
[58:59] in your own life it's a battle you will
[59:03] fight and you must win so that you can
[59:06] be more than a conqueror.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; One of the nights
[59:16] says I know how hard it was
[59:22] that night when I woke
[59:26] in that little old colored mission.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Colored mission out there.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. The black church, black people's
[59:39] church.
[59:41] Amen. Amen.
[59:44] You know, you don't know how hard it was
[59:50] in the olden days when they look at the
[59:53] people, especially the black people,
[59:56] they didn't consider them as Christian.
[1:00:00] And it came to brother Brham as well.
[1:00:04] And he said it was hard.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; And all the white folks
[1:00:10] standing around there
[1:00:13] said, "There he goes
[1:00:16] in a colored mission.
[1:00:20] It was hard.
[1:00:22] I walked up there with a whole lot of
[1:00:26] Kentucky pride in me
[1:00:32] like that.
[1:00:34] But God saw the heart of brother
[1:00:36] Brennan. He came close to brother
[1:00:39] Brennan and said to him, "If you want
[1:00:43] it,
[1:00:45] walk right on in there."
[1:00:49] And I walked right in there and nailed
[1:00:52] down to an altar
[1:00:54] and there I stayed.
[1:00:58] He said
[1:01:00] I died the old self
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] you know Brenham
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; 20 years ago.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The man of God says, "If you
[1:01:17] say that's a funeral,
[1:01:21] well, brother, if there was ever a time
[1:01:26] where we needed a funeral,
[1:01:30] the time is right now when men
[1:01:35] will die to theirelves
[1:01:40] right."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] So brother Brenham
[1:01:46] was an ordinary person like ourselves.
[1:01:51] But what make him different
[1:01:55] gift that God put in him because he was
[1:02:01] a prophet.
[1:02:02] He was a prophet. We see God in flesh
[1:02:07] through the life of brother.
[1:02:10] Then he said the the old me
[1:02:15] must die. There must be a funeral of the
[1:02:19] old me
[1:02:22] so that I can be worthy for the gospel.
[1:02:27] I was crucified with Christ
[1:02:30] yet I live.
[1:02:32] Not me, but Christ himself.
[1:02:37] Someday in that glorious resurrection
[1:02:41] when he comes my body may be resting
[1:02:46] beneath the sought out yonder.
[1:02:51] But it when it does,
[1:02:54] you will see the grass
[1:02:56] move back.
[1:02:59] And I will come forth in his great
[1:03:02] glorious image.
[1:03:06] Beside many of them, hallelujah.
[1:03:10] For I know him in the power
[1:03:15] of his release. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Brother said so that your your self,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; your old you must come to an end must be
[1:03:30] buried
[1:03:32] come to a funeral where the the old you
[1:03:37] die
[1:03:39] the new you will come in for that is the
[1:03:43] life of Christ in you.
[1:03:48] Amen. Amen. Brother Brennham says
[1:03:51] beforeh
[1:03:55] he had an opportunity
[1:03:58] of talking to him and brother Bosworth
[1:04:01] was saying to brother Brenham
[1:04:04] Bill I'm going brother was like you're
[1:04:08] not going to go bos said to him God
[1:04:12] bless you brother God bless you sister
[1:04:15] hallelujah and after some time he
[1:04:18] departed
[1:04:21] That's how a man of God live this world.
[1:04:27] Not like those
[1:04:29] that called me so and so.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Not those that they will say call me so
[1:04:34] and so
[1:04:36] to apologize
[1:04:39] before I go. But a child of God is
[1:04:43] forever ready.
[1:04:45] God make you ready the day you leave.
[1:04:50] Just close your eyes because heaven has
[1:04:52] come.
[1:04:54] Amen.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I will tell you the testimony the other
[1:04:59] day of what I've seen.
[1:05:03] Brother Brenham says he was praying
[1:05:07] for brother's family
[1:05:10] about this man. Then he said, "Oh
[1:05:13] blessed God,
[1:05:15] As as as Christian,
[1:05:19] we bow our head to the dust from where
[1:05:21] we came.
[1:05:24] Someday we shall return if Jesus
[1:05:27] returns.
[1:05:31] There is one
[1:05:33] who has walked amongst us,
[1:05:38] preach to us, thy humble
[1:05:42] and holy servant,
[1:05:44] brother FF
[1:05:48] tonight,
[1:05:49] his body lays in a casket,
[1:05:53] but his soul.
[1:05:59] Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And across the border,
[1:06:05] he was coming down to the river the
[1:06:09] other morning and the waves was flying
[1:06:11] high
[1:06:14] in the air at the old Jordan.
[1:06:18] We know that there was many friends to
[1:06:21] meet him
[1:06:24] preach Christ to them
[1:06:27] by preaching the gospel.
[1:06:29] that by the cause he had brought them to
[1:06:32] a saving knowledge
[1:06:35] of thy dear son
[1:06:38] and they were there
[1:06:40] to meet him. We trust that you'll
[1:06:43] blessed
[1:06:46] this gallant soul. You bless this guy.
[1:06:51] And let us remember by his life and his
[1:06:55] example and his teaching and how he
[1:06:59] firmly firmly stood
[1:07:02] by eternal weight
[1:07:05] until he lived to be a ripe old age
[1:07:11] many way many years over the loted time.
[1:07:17] I'm giving this example
[1:07:20] because we know we are bearing a gallant
[1:07:24] soldier of God.
[1:07:27] I know Mar
[1:07:29] as someone with other mamas
[1:07:35] warriors worship warriors.
[1:07:38] And I always say
[1:07:42] be scared of the prayer of a woman.
[1:07:45] When a woman pray,
[1:07:48] God listen and he will answer
[1:07:50] accordingly.
[1:07:52] I want to tell you this because I have
[1:07:55] experienced something.
[1:07:58] Well, let me just give you the tip a
[1:08:00] little bit before I continue.
[1:08:03] Last Sunday
[1:08:06] when sister Dudo was testifying there,
[1:08:10] I'm the eyewitness.
[1:08:12] From day one, if the pastor had admitted
[1:08:15] in this battle,
[1:08:18] I was there. Even today, I was with him.
[1:08:23] But I want to tell you this when we were
[1:08:26] at the hospital.
[1:08:28] I'm just saying this because
[1:08:31] Amen. Oh.
[1:08:38] Let me put it this way.
[1:08:41] When you are a shepherd,
[1:08:44] go for gold, sheep, donkeys, cattle and
[1:08:48] so forth,
[1:08:50] you you have field where you plow
[1:08:54] maybe millime or whatever.
[1:08:57] When that moment you have ripped what
[1:09:00] you saw,
[1:09:03] the stock remain in the field there
[1:09:06] because you fence the area.
[1:09:11] Comes a time whereby
[1:09:13] now you feel like your animals
[1:09:18] can indulge themselves there.
[1:09:24] Now you have taken them to
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this because
[1:09:28] I was a bit you know not saying anything
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; but today I can talk.
[1:09:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:38] When I arrived with my wife early in the
[1:09:41] morning around 11:00,
[1:09:46] the pastor
[1:09:49] came out of the wister
[1:09:53] in when I get in I the doctor came in as
[1:09:58] well and the two nurses as well
[1:10:02] later what's happened but I want to
[1:10:05] focus on this one.
[1:10:07] When I'm in there, the pastor was
[1:10:10] talking something I did not understand
[1:10:13] like he is going.
[1:10:16] He see Jesus and he was laughing. He was
[1:10:20] so happy. Then I stood there looking at
[1:10:24] him. I don't know what happened.
[1:10:27] Something triggered to manga.
[1:10:33] He came then on the opposite of where
[1:10:35] I'm standing. The pastor was laying on
[1:10:38] the bed and the pastor was keep on
[1:10:40] saying Jesus is calling me. I see his
[1:10:44] hand. I am going and I had said to the
[1:10:48] pastor,
[1:10:51] you know what?
[1:10:53] You will not die.
[1:10:56] When you come to the hospital here, you
[1:10:59] were alive. You will leave the hospital
[1:11:03] alive. I'm not going to take you out of
[1:11:06] this hospital
[1:11:08] with a plastic or a casket. And when I
[1:11:10] look at her face, it's a very serious
[1:11:13] faith. Then I was just quiet there. As
[1:11:16] the master was talking about the
[1:11:18] program,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; brother, make sure the pastors are
[1:11:23] there. Make sure the order is in place.
[1:11:26] Let the children of God. I'm going. Then
[1:11:30] said, you not going to go in.
[1:11:33] I said, I I respect such.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When a woman prayed, when a
[1:11:41] woman had a wish,
[1:11:43] it wasn't exactly like that.
[1:11:47] I will tell you the full story the other
[1:11:49] day what I've experienced.
[1:11:52] I'm saying this because the family of
[1:11:56] Reeba
[1:11:58] should just settle.
[1:12:01] Mama is in a better place. God has
[1:12:04] prepared for her.
[1:12:06] I'm going to read about a woman here
[1:12:09] because we are burying a woman here and
[1:12:12] brother Brennham was responsible.
[1:12:16] I'm going to tell you the little story.
[1:12:19] Brother Brandham says, "I was speaking
[1:12:22] at a funeral service
[1:12:25] other day for an little old lady
[1:12:30] about 85 years of old
[1:12:33] that went to meet the Lord
[1:12:36] and she was a sweet little old woman."
[1:12:42] That was the mother to a friend of
[1:12:45] brother Brennan
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; called Lloyd.
[1:12:50] That was the madam just passed away.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Fort Mrs.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; He said this they amongst the poorest of
[1:13:00] the poor
[1:13:02] lord. The boy who give me the legging.
[1:13:07] We have been chs since little boys.
[1:13:11] He's just a little older than me than I.
[1:13:15] And I said to him, Lloyd Lloyd,
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; what would you want me to take the
[1:13:21] funeral text from?
[1:13:25] That's what brother Brenham
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; asked brother Lloyd Lloyd.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Then brother Lloyd responded brother
[1:13:32] Brenham
[1:13:34] and he said I would like you
[1:13:39] for you to speak on this
[1:13:42] if is the will of the Lord.
[1:13:45] just some assurance
[1:13:48] that my mother
[1:13:50] will be back again.
[1:13:53] Brother said
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; very well.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; So he took the text
[1:13:59] from the book of Job
[1:14:02] where we just read now as our title this
[1:14:05] evening.
[1:14:07] If a man die, shall he live again?
[1:14:13] Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; If a man die, shall he live again?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brenham was preaching in the
[1:14:21] funeral. Then he said
[1:14:24] after being missionary
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; and traveling the world.
[1:14:32] I've had a privilege
[1:14:34] of seeing many gods,
[1:14:38] the philosophies, philosophy of life and
[1:14:42] what people worship
[1:14:44] and in all of it
[1:14:47] about all of it is
[1:14:49] a philosophy
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; outside of Christianity.
[1:14:54] Christianity
[1:14:56] has the truth.
[1:14:59] Amen. Brother says he was all over
[1:15:05] the Buddhism,
[1:15:07] the Arabic worshiping
[1:15:11] the gods in Africa.
[1:15:13] He was looking at them, how they do
[1:15:16] things. But he said Christianity
[1:15:20] is outstanding.
[1:15:22] One good reason. the person who's
[1:15:26] responsible for the Christianity
[1:15:30] died and rise again.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The Islamic people
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; are still waiting even today
[1:15:43] to come.
[1:15:45] He died and never come back. Our Lord
[1:15:49] Jesus Christ
[1:15:51] died and rise at the third day until the
[1:15:56] soldiers were told
[1:15:59] were told that when the people ask him
[1:16:03] you must tell them that they are his
[1:16:06] disciples
[1:16:07] came at night and stole him.
[1:16:12] He was never stolen. He arrived. They
[1:16:16] they failed to see
[1:16:18] that Jesus was God in flesh.
[1:16:22] Today the people fail to see that you
[1:16:26] are God in flesh. If they want to see
[1:16:29] God today, if they want to hear from God
[1:16:32] today, they must not go far. must come
[1:16:36] to you because Christ whom they
[1:16:39] crucified is in you is him walking
[1:16:45] talking through you.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Now we know that this world is a
[1:16:55] creation and before
[1:16:58] there can be a creation, there must be a
[1:17:01] creation.
[1:17:04] There's nothing
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; that just came.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; As long as there's a creation,
[1:17:10] there is a creator.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And this creator
[1:17:17] express himself in his creation.
[1:17:22] If we did not even have a Bible,
[1:17:24] we will still know that the truth
[1:17:29] just as we do. The Bible just put things
[1:17:33] in order. You are the one order of God,
[1:17:40] the manifestation
[1:17:42] of who God is.
[1:17:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now God creating the
[1:17:48] creation
[1:17:50] is expressing himself
[1:17:53] back in the creation
[1:17:57] and he makes us different.
[1:18:01] We are not the same. We cannot be the
[1:18:03] same. Our God is God of heaven
[1:18:08] and others we make them rich
[1:18:12] and they remain rich and others he made
[1:18:17] them poor it's God who did that don't
[1:18:21] blame him
[1:18:24] I'm reading about a poor woman here but
[1:18:27] I want to tell you this brother Benham
[1:18:30] says that woman as poor as she
[1:18:34] All she has to teach the people.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; But but the rich people when you ask
[1:18:45] something they will say go and work
[1:18:49] because I work harder
[1:18:52] to achieve this. And you go and try
[1:18:55] harder,
[1:18:57] you become more poorer.
[1:18:59] Because God has never gave you the
[1:19:02] richness of this he this earth has gave
[1:19:06] you the richness of heaven.
[1:19:11] Don't be like somebody.
[1:19:16] But we got a place to serve God.
[1:19:19] And that's the place he placed us in.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; If we'll just abide
[1:19:27] in that place.
[1:19:29] If you can just stay right in the word
[1:19:32] of God, he is doing everything
[1:19:36] for you.
[1:19:38] Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; You you don't need to tell the people if
[1:19:44] you have something that do not have and
[1:19:47] say I work harder, I pray harder.
[1:19:52] If God
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; gave you
[1:19:56] and if he gave you,
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; give others.
[1:20:01] Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I I have a friend of mine who were at
[1:20:07] school together at a high school.
[1:20:10] He is one of the richest people in in in
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Can you just give me a piece of your he
[1:20:17] said
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; the following day when I tried to phone
[1:20:22] He blocked me.
[1:20:29] I realize
[1:20:33] is the life we're living in
[1:20:38] because I'm going to
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and then when brother was reading the
[1:20:42] the job scripture
[1:20:45] at the funeral
[1:20:47] he gave example and said as I said now
[1:20:52] watch the little flower.
[1:20:56] This was along October.
[1:21:02] died and the little seed turned back to
[1:21:06] the earth and God is having the funeral
[1:21:11] service
[1:21:13] in these four rains.
[1:21:17] This great big drops of tear dropping
[1:21:19] from the skies
[1:21:23] bearing them
[1:21:25] and coming up through Kentucky.
[1:21:28] I said other day upon the big chest of
[1:21:33] the mountains
[1:21:36] he set out his bits across the earth
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:42] the leaves brown red
[1:21:48] is in bereiement because the res is dead
[1:21:53] and he buried them beneath the ground
[1:21:56] and He knows just as sure as the earth
[1:22:00] comes back
[1:22:03] around the line of the sun again
[1:22:07] every one of them will rise again but
[1:22:11] it's just a routine
[1:22:13] he goes through
[1:22:16] speak to us that there is a resurrection
[1:22:21] I notice here the sun in the morning
[1:22:26] rise
[1:22:27] And it's a little baby
[1:22:30] when it's born. The sun like a little
[1:22:33] baby when it's
[1:22:35] supposed to warm the earth.
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:40] It cannot warm the earth

[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Is born a new

[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; God in every faith.
[1:23:54] A child of God who was born live the
[1:23:58] life until you die at the west at the
[1:24:03] noon time.
[1:24:06] At the noon time,
[1:24:08] is it the end of you? No.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Bright morning
[1:24:15] shall come again.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That is why the body will be
[1:24:22] put incorruptible
[1:24:26] and rise again. Incorruptible.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our mama has departed at his her
[1:24:37] old age,
[1:24:39] but he will rise
[1:24:41] as young again.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible teaches us.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Now you see then I said
[1:24:50] why
[1:24:52] there's one requirement
[1:24:55] and I love to say this in the church
[1:24:58] like this.
[1:25:00] There's one requirement
[1:25:02] that is required there
[1:25:05] no matter
[1:25:07] how beautiful the seat is.
[1:25:10] It must be gitized.
[1:25:13] It got to be gitized.
[1:25:16] And if it does serve God's purpose
[1:25:21] because the beex that Poland
[1:25:25] and so forth.
[1:25:27] So Job was looking at the life of the
[1:25:33] tree.
[1:25:34] He saw how tree get dried up,
[1:25:39] how flowers fell on the on the ground.
[1:25:45] But one day
[1:25:47] that flower having the seed and the seed
[1:25:50] going down thinking is dead. But when
[1:25:54] the rain come, the seed brought forth
[1:25:59] itself
[1:26:00] 10 times.
[1:26:03] When the when the devil
[1:26:05] thought he found you, he thought you are
[1:26:08] dead. That's when you are buried by God.
[1:26:13] But one of the days I will call you up.
[1:26:19] But then the master of all it says,
[1:26:21] "Yes,
[1:26:24] But the the the little lily couldn't
[1:26:26] make conflict.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; We all have a thing like we do.
[1:26:34] We all have a things like we do.
[1:26:38] Amen. We serve God in the category
[1:26:43] that we put in
[1:26:45] and it becomes back
[1:26:49] the same.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:26:53] The thieves they will die thieves
[1:26:57] and rise thieves a children of God will
[1:27:00] die a children of God. We will rise as a
[1:27:03] children of God. Death is not going to
[1:27:07] change you. But the way you are the way
[1:27:11] God has put you
[1:27:13] in the word of God.
[1:27:15] He wants you to serve him
[1:27:19] as you are.
[1:27:23] So if you think you are poor
[1:27:26] is God loved you to be like that.
[1:27:31] I can repeat myself.
[1:27:33] The way you are is the way God wants you
[1:27:36] to be.
[1:27:38] Serve God in that condition. There's
[1:27:42] something good waiting for you.
[1:27:45] I said she was poor
[1:27:49] as poor could be.
[1:27:51] But nobody
[1:27:54] could ever come to her door or need
[1:28:03] but what she would give to them. No what
[1:28:05] I'm trying to say no matter you can come
[1:28:07] to a door or needy.
[1:28:14] Amen.
[1:28:15] But you will give to them.
[1:28:21] The neighbors,
[1:28:22] no matter what trouble they was in,
[1:28:26] this woman,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Ford,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; any hour of the night,
[1:28:32] was there to help
[1:28:34] do anything she could do
[1:28:38] what she had to do with.
[1:28:43] You know the poor people
[1:28:46] is just using the way are the one that
[1:28:50] gives than those that are rich.
[1:28:55] Did you know that it's always the case?
[1:29:00] When you ask a brother maybe something
[1:29:03] or money for transfer,
[1:29:06] you will say, "Brother, you must pray so
[1:29:10] that God can bless you."
[1:29:14] But when you ask the poor, I don't have
[1:29:17] money or will money to go to the
[1:29:20] service. He will try and give you
[1:29:25] because God made us impart life.
[1:29:30] You know brother Brenham saying when you
[1:29:32] reach that life
[1:29:35] of Christianity the real Christianity
[1:29:39] is when you no longer live for yourself
[1:29:44] but live
[1:29:45] others.
[1:29:47] Have you ever seen a mama who staying in
[1:29:50] a shack
[1:29:52] happy as she is when sweeping the floor
[1:29:56] and singing the song happy with the
[1:29:59] kids?
[1:30:01] The only full meal
[1:30:04] they can have is bread and mearine.
[1:30:10] start happily.
[1:30:13] But the rich people from the most
[1:30:16] expensive suburb
[1:30:19] mama riding his her own car driving a
[1:30:22] car, daddy her own car, the kids there
[1:30:28] angry
[1:30:30] as they go out of the complex.
[1:30:34] Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; You are earthly prosperity.
[1:30:41] does not
[1:30:43] determine
[1:30:44] the prosperity
[1:30:48] in the word of God. Amen. I even see in
[1:30:52] the church
[1:30:54] check after service when we go home
[1:30:57] those that have money they go for lunch
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; somewhere in the most expensive
[1:31:06] when they see you pass through the
[1:31:07] window
[1:31:10] what does he want here he mustn't enter
[1:31:12] because we're going to pay the bill for
[1:31:14] you
[1:31:19] but those that do not have you'll find
[1:31:23] themselves
[1:31:24] but it's
[1:31:27] that is the only thing they can afford
[1:31:32] and I said
[1:31:34] above that
[1:31:37] you know I I have an opportunity
[1:31:40] of seeing that seed
[1:31:44] deitized by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:48] she was born again
[1:31:50] of the spirit of God. I said now we are
[1:31:54] going to and say she will not rise
[1:31:56] again.
[1:31:58] It's a question. If you say she won't
[1:32:02] rise again, the leaf
[1:32:05] didn't go down to the bottom of the tree
[1:32:09] before the frost fell
[1:32:11] to hide itself to come back next year
[1:32:16] with a new leaf.
[1:32:18] If that lay
[1:32:21] the substate up in that tree,
[1:32:26] the frost froze
[1:32:30] and heat death, it will kill that gem of
[1:32:33] life.
[1:32:35] That same in that s and the tree will
[1:32:39] die. But some intelligency,
[1:32:43] it has none of its own.
[1:32:47] some intelligency.
[1:32:49] It has none of its own
[1:32:53] life.
[1:32:55] It has no intelligency.
[1:33:00] But somebody,
[1:33:02] something
[1:33:03] controls it.
[1:33:07] Brothers and sisters, you have no
[1:33:10] intelligence.
[1:33:13] how you were born,
[1:33:15] how you will live, how you will die, how
[1:33:19] you will resurrect, but there's
[1:33:21] something in you that controls you. You
[1:33:25] are part of God and is God doing that.
[1:33:29] That is why
[1:33:32] will say just be the mechanics.
[1:33:35] He will be you know the dynamic.
[1:33:40] Let him have a control in your life.
[1:33:43] When you live, you live for him. When
[1:33:46] you die, you die for him. When you
[1:33:49] resurrect, you resurrect for him. He
[1:33:53] made you to be an offspring
[1:33:58] of him.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] What does that what does that
[1:34:07] what intelligency
[1:34:09] the same intelligency
[1:34:12] controls
[1:34:13] our own life there's a certain
[1:34:16] intelligence
[1:34:18] that is controlling our own life we
[1:34:21] cannot help ourselves that's why we will
[1:34:24] need him
[1:34:27] she will arise again someday
[1:34:29] she just got it all
[1:34:32] our
[1:34:33] will rise again one day.
[1:34:39] That is the nature that God has put in
[1:34:43] us.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Before you could say
[1:34:49] she will not you'd have to say there's
[1:34:52] no springtime.
[1:34:54] There's no resurrection of the seed.
[1:34:57] There's no summer and winter.
[1:35:00] There's no rising and setting of the
[1:35:02] sun. Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as the word of
[1:35:04] God.
[1:35:06] Why? It will be crazy to say such thing.
[1:35:11] There is a resurrection
[1:35:13] and just show the world flows around
[1:35:18] the face of the sun.
[1:35:21] It gives commissions by God himself
[1:35:25] to raise up with his warm rays.
[1:35:30] life.
[1:35:32] Life
[1:35:34] needs the son.
[1:35:36] Our life need the son, Lord Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ.
[1:35:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; My last quote,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; it says,
[1:35:50] "Now, I like this one. That's why it's
[1:35:53] my closing quote. Listen to it."
[1:35:57] Now, if I drop this piece on the floor,
[1:36:05] it went down
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; and I come over here
[1:36:10] and pick up something similar to the
[1:36:12] piece I throw down.
[1:36:17] Now, that isn't resurrection.
[1:36:21] Do you hear that? That's replacement.
[1:36:27] But the resurrection
[1:36:29] is to bring this
[1:36:31] same one up and the same one will come
[1:36:36] again. That is the resurrection. The
[1:36:40] body that we lay in the ground, the same
[1:36:45] body should rise again, not a
[1:36:48] replacement, but when it comes again is
[1:36:52] young.
[1:36:54] Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; And we go down
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; motor
[1:37:01] immortal
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; and we slept of that day.
[1:37:08] Our whole Christian life
[1:37:12] built right there
[1:37:15] and right there alone.
[1:37:17] So to come together and sit in heavenly
[1:37:21] places
[1:37:25] in Christ Jesus,
[1:37:27] what a privilege it is to us of all
[1:37:31] young and old looking for that time when
[1:37:35] Jesus shall come. If you put a seed on
[1:37:40] the ground, the very same seed is the
[1:37:43] one that will rise again. There's no
[1:37:46] replacement.
[1:37:48] of your life. The very same life that
[1:37:51] you lay. We lay our lives before you
[1:37:56] Lord. The very same life that we laid
[1:37:59] before him is the very same life that
[1:38:03] will rise again because that
[1:38:05] intelligence of heaven is the one that
[1:38:09] resurrect us. So we are not we are
[1:38:13] irreplaceable.
[1:38:17] Amen. God has made us like this
[1:38:20] purposely.
[1:38:22] Don't doubt yourself. If you think you
[1:38:24] are poor, you think you don't have, God
[1:38:28] wants you to be like that. Keep on
[1:38:31] praising him, something glorious
[1:38:34] that is waiting for you up there.
[1:38:38] God bless you.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] Our
[1:38:44] mama
[1:38:46] will rise again. If the family had the
[1:38:50] same question
[1:38:52] like brother Lloyd, here is the answer.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; We shall rise again.
[1:39:01] Amen. Amen.
