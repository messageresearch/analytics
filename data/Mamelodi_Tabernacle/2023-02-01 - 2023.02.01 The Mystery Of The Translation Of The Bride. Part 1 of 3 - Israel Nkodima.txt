Description:
This message was preached by pastor Israel Nkodima on 26 December 2016 at The Final voice tabernacle in Kempton Park South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the translation of the bride of Christ. The Pastor read Revelation 22:6 “And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.”
‭‭
He further reads Genesis‬ ‭18‬:‭9‬-‭15‬“And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.”

He also read Genesis‬ ‭21‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭KJV‬‬ “And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.”

Genesis let's start with Genesis amen amen God bless you amen Hebrews is matching my mind let's start with Genesis chapter 18 verse 9 to 14. from verse 9 to 14. amen amen chapter 18 Genesis chapter 18

Abraham a son in his own age at a set time of which God has spoken to him amen you may be seated God bless you okay don't you have mics for these brothers here calendar Mike foreign we are here brothers and sisters so glad to meet in this place only and we believe that God is gonna bless us mainly that I am part of you this ministers here are my equals foreign but we are just one believing the same thing and we believe God who spoke to us through the seventh messenger as we you know we don't have a problem solve the eighth messenger here we only have seven Messengers and should someone speak about the eighth messenger it is his own sermon not ours is a special mood you know I was so my heart was so delighted when I read about God's visitation a place where God would come and visit a man chosen especially by God amen amen to serve God in his house Abraham Abraham chosen of God amen amen and when God left his place for to visit the Earth was before God can leave his place to pay a visit to the Earth he must have amen much the sea a seed a man who would hear him a man would accept him I'm a man who saw him changing from being a hell of light into human body how blessed is such a man [Music] three Halos of life and he recognized when they entered the body I bought he saw it he saw Elohim one Elohim before he stepped into a human body so we need such a Ministry we see each other Ministry that will show us God coming down into a human into a human body when he stepped friend one time is in the air the last human body is [Applause] behold Bona God is with us because we saw him come and removed amen amen he came into human body all right this is what we are looking at firstly then let us start here to Memphis and he came down to Abraham and they were old how about your face at that time because God wants to do things after the end of time [Music] amen amen amen and when he reached the house of Abraham they were older faith foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] maybe you want us to go back again let me touch book of this book I love very much amen John chapter six verse 44. no man can come to me [Music] and yet he was talking to the people who thought that they came to him because they were standing before him [Applause] tomorrow men can come to me I'm in I mean because one part is natural and the other part is Supernatural amen come to him is to come to the supernatural yes but could not come to him uh she came from from here innermost [Applause] she came to the innermost amen said come and see a man who told me all things first place amen so people come coming expecting to see a man when they arrived this verse 25 more verse the woman said unto uh pardon me pardon me 29 I I I I want to say okay come see a man she said to the people who told me all these things that ever I did now when they come they have come to see this man outstanding before amen then he continues is not this the Christ uh now that is something deeper now yeah because our man for saying Jesus is Christ you would be stoned because it was more than a man amen firstly he addressed them um so they expected to see a man and to know Lord what's all about the man she wants us to see foreign uh not everybody could say yes he is the Christ because [Music] so that's why the end time message Christ and said are Christ The Mystery of God revealed [Music] it's modern Christ The Mystery of God revealed he can't say Jesus the mystery of God reveals because the people know Jesus even where he was born they can talk about him and preach you can introduce every anybody to Jesus Christ you need to introduce Christ to Ethiopians [Applause] that's why he said after Peter said Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God you hear it son of the Living God amen why why didn't he say thou art Jesus oh I don't have that part here but I can quote it to you it is in my books here now Christ Christ talking about Christ Peter says because brother Ibraham says the son that was with the father who has cry what was the logos [Applause] oh my God so Christ was the son yes yeah there's this party that can lead us to Abram and Abraham I read this party he speaks here page 15 of cod page 15 field God gave himself birth to this son which was before there was even an atom is amen and this one was before there was any atoms then yeah he was not human even it was God himself and who took this form called we call it logos logos logos is the theophany Moses saw him motion Moon as he passed by Raffi he saw that part of God and who is melchized that tells you it was that feel funny who is this of God coming this way because he was revealed in our time in his complete station the prophet even saw him and called out and said Jesus [Applause] when Moses saw him he saw only the big part now Moses can see him today he can see the front part when they appeared in theophany foreign stepped into flesh but not melchized it's still the same God at the time when he visited Abraham in order we bring about the promise he has made he he became a man it is another part of God and he appeared a uh before Abraham Abraham was looking for a city now uh before Billy he could enter the city and all of us he met the king first of the city you will you will never go to the New Jerusalem unless you have met the king first because it's a city that has a king I mean I'll read to you again before we can enter in search of the city he thought that it was already here on Earth the prophet of God says [Applause] and the seed was with him we were in him amen amen so we experienced amen amen that's why you find in Revelation Hebrews chapter 11. you see the Seed of Abraham also in migrations personal name came to the literal Sports Jesus said You shall be my Witnesses starting from Jerusalem Jerusalem that's why the Bible says until he said something and after he has spent the time with them the Bible say they said now let us go back talking about the things that has happened and Jesus said to them all foolish to understand Jerusalem amen but let's start here now you see here this visitation [Music] the mood of the visitation of melchized this one oh he hasn't seen this one or stepping into a human form he just saw melchized this one but with Elohim he saw him coming and stepped into human forms [Music] we have both things here at the end time we have him when he stepped into human foreign all right amen because as it was today is not answer to how so shall it becomes is as it was so it is happening now has happened among us all right that's why he was here with us again he ate Dusty Lake sometimes from hunting you know amen he was here with us [Music] now let's carry on now we are going to look at it how were they as we have said yesterday uh for God to run through his seed he has to prepare a channel amen amen and Isaac as the Bible says see the seed shall be called in Isaac God already made a way from Heaven coming down to Abraham Through the Ages the end of Ages the seven Church ages he introduced himself um that's why the Seven Seals shall not be understood by just a mere man because it is beyond time now if you go beyond time [Applause] it is now your your foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] this is not just a church member it's a promised I believe you are not just a church member I promised so you look for a promised sound and church is looking for a promised son referring to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ because right now we are not waiting for the coming of the Lord coming for the Lord in the Rapture I would say because brought him down to the Earth the people are confused because they are going around looking around the Earth but he spoke to the Earth shall come to his Temple foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] amen okay amen okay and he is known only where he is [Applause] did you hear it God is only known in a place where he is all right amen now let's read and they were looking the church is looking for a promised son not any Jesus but they promised one after all coming to the promised Sons the people born of God the promised son the bride is looking for the promised son foreign [Applause] [Applause] amen when he was born the three Majors they picked up a sign I mean could only read about it the Pharisees the prisoners while the others amen so it's two different categories of those that are reading about it and those who have received aside and some were in the field [Music] a choir of angels singing this there was this woman she also received a sign they came to his birthday the birth of Jesus Christ announced to them by God himself did not know about it like the end time Seven Seals by God himself so it won't rule everybody to come there [Applause] you have received it from God and they come back to where he is [Applause] some gifts um foreign party [Applause] and he was not born there yeah speaker [Music] cannot come into a denomination so they went out to reconnected again now they followed again until it came where he was born [Applause] the sign didn't go about ice cream for directions asking whether it is revealed or not revealed we know that a cloud appeared uh uh let me read it do you listen to him you understand some people are still waiting to hear from Brother Brennan Brothers but he has laid the whole thing and ended by saying he this is not the secrets the word is in the bride and they know what to do we are not conscious Brothers we know what to do we know who we are we know where we are is
