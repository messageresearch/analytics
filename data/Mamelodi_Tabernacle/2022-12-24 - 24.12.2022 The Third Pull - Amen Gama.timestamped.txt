[2:32:16] now

[2:34:10] moving
[2:34:15] that which is above the key
[2:34:18] or solomoni Solomon
[2:34:22] and that which was in Solomon the King
[2:34:25] was now clear
[2:34:27] um
[2:34:28] when they started playing the hubs and
[2:34:30] instruments
[2:34:32] Solomon
[2:34:41] now the mystery was now made clear
[2:34:45] Allelujah
[2:34:48] that's why even soul
[2:34:52] even Saul

[2:34:56] when he got into trouble
[2:34:59] he wanted that the happy place
[2:35:03] David would play the happiness
[2:35:06] and now something would leave
[2:35:10] Satan knows the revelation
[2:35:13] of the children of God
[2:35:17] when we sing
[2:35:19] we had to go to college
[2:35:22] Satan knows that there is a there is
[2:35:27] that he's not able to come against
[2:35:29] anymore
[2:35:36] the prophet says
[2:35:40] teaching places the church positionally
[2:35:47] see if we are pastors
[2:35:50] when we have pastors they teach us about
[2:35:53] this
[2:35:56] is our date if placing a position
[2:36:03] when you don't have a pasta you don't
[2:36:05] have a you are not positioned
[2:36:11] if you have not accepted your pastor you
[2:36:14] have not been positionally placed
[2:36:17] foreign
[2:36:22] amen
[2:36:24] um
[2:36:24] or if you doubt the pastor
[2:36:27] you are not positionally placed in
[2:36:30] physics
[2:36:32] I want to speak to the people who have
[2:36:35] been positionally foreign
[2:36:52] that's why the scripture says
[2:36:59] I always put
[2:37:02] a god
[2:37:04] I always put
[2:37:06] him
[2:37:08] before me
[2:37:15] in the description
[2:37:21] 16.
[2:37:24] Psalms chapter six I always say it the
[2:37:27] Lord before me
[2:37:35] if we have people who always said the
[2:37:39] Lord
[2:37:40] amen
[2:37:41] before the abundance between those are
[2:37:45] the people are going to be rapture
[2:37:48] Psalms chapter 16 verse 8 yes eight yes
[2:37:50] it says I have set the lord always
[2:37:53] before me because he is at my right hand
[2:37:56] I shall not be moved
[2:38:26] so that I shall not be moved
[2:38:29] foreign
[2:38:51] that when the Lord comes we shall not be
[2:38:54] ashamed hallelujah amen
[2:39:15] that this is what I required of a man
[2:39:19] hallelujah amen
[2:39:24] if you have set the Lord before you
[2:39:27] know
[2:39:28] there is nothing that Satan can do to
[2:39:30] you
[2:39:32] Mondays
[2:39:37] there are many times that say traps that
[2:39:40] Satan tries but if he finds you having
[2:39:42] set the lord always before you
[2:39:46] again there is nothing that he can do to
[2:39:49] you
[2:39:50] we read a scripture that says hey that's
[2:39:53] Isaiah 59 verse 19 Isaiah 59 verse 19.
[2:40:06] yes
[2:40:09] the Bible says
[2:40:11] Isaiah 59 verse 19. so shall they fear
[2:40:14] the name of the Lord from the West and
[2:40:18] his glory from the rising of the Sun
[2:40:20] when the enemy shall come in like a
[2:40:22] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[2:40:25] up his standard against you amen
[2:40:28] hallelujah amen
[2:40:31] is there an enemy here
[2:40:36] is the enemy here
[2:40:40] um's Corner if there is the enemy
[2:40:45] we are waiting for the spirit of the
[2:40:47] Lord
[2:40:50] when you say easy so that the spirit of
[2:40:53] the Lord May lift up the standard amen
[2:40:56] that's why
[2:40:57] that's why when we find those that are
[2:41:00] sick
[2:41:05] we must remind them of this scripture
[2:41:12] amen God bless praise God Amen that God
[2:41:16] raises the standard
[2:41:20] when God has raised the standard
[2:41:24] um
[2:41:27] the child of God is not shaking
[2:41:30] Hallelujah
[2:41:33] um
[2:41:46] [Music]
[2:41:50] there's a standard that has not been
[2:41:52] raised
[2:41:55] just like a fire that is
[2:42:15] um
[2:42:22] the enemy is able to raise the standard
[2:42:25] also from their side but
[2:42:27] the third pool always

[2:42:33] Christ
[2:42:34] um

[3:14:21] whereby the prophets were privileged
[3:14:25] Prophet The Prophet himself
[3:14:34] to preach to the predestinated

[3:14:47] not just ordinary believers

[3:26:22] yeah page 65. it has 365
[3:26:28] that's right
[3:26:32] now these points will be important in
[3:26:35] the seals
[3:26:41] This Is the End
[3:26:46] now see the mystery of this I'm now uh
[3:26:49] on page 64. now see the midst of this

[3:27:18] the messages that wrote out there
[3:27:24] and we got it in tape form see Pat in
[3:27:28] mind
[3:27:32] um
[3:27:35] the message of for the end of the

[3:27:51] this message
[3:27:53] is now in tape and book forms
[3:27:58] [Music]
[3:28:01] as I'm reading I'm reading from the book
[3:28:04] um
[3:28:06] the message over the seventh angel but
[3:28:09] in the days of that voice
[3:28:17] the whole mystery should be finished
[3:28:22] as he declared to his servants the
[3:28:26] pastors see
[3:28:34] now
[3:28:35] this is the seventh Manchester United
[3:28:42] the book the book of The Mystery of God
[3:28:45] is
[3:28:47] not revealed until the 7th the seventh
[3:28:52] Angels message is sounded
[3:28:59] um
[3:29:06] the pastor wouldn't have a message to
[3:29:09] preach if the servant Angel did not
[3:29:11] preached first um
[3:29:16] the message of the pastor was not gonna
[3:29:18] he was not going to hit the sport if the
[3:29:21] seventh angel was not there the Wheel by
[3:29:23] just a merry-go-rounds
[3:29:26] because there's seven angels already
[3:29:29] sounded
[3:29:34] it's guiding the pastor to preach about
[3:29:37] things
[3:29:43] [Applause]
[3:29:53] it takes
[3:29:55] the bride
[3:29:57] to peace
[3:30:05] now it's it's root mysterious

[3:30:15] enough
[3:30:35] is it worshipers
[3:30:38] the worshipers in truth
[3:30:45] I myself I don't feel comfortable
[3:30:48] worshiping with people who don't Worship
[3:30:49] in truth
[3:30:59] we don't worship with people who are not
[3:31:02] what God intends us to be
[3:31:08] the book is mysterious
[3:31:14] became the third yes touch
[3:31:19] that sword
[3:31:22] that was given to brother

[3:31:32] which is
[3:31:35] the Lamb's Book of Life
[3:31:38] [Music]
[3:31:40] meaning that when brother Brennan
[3:31:43] preaches
[3:31:45] he only outlined the message to the
[3:31:48] predestinated
[3:31:49] [Music]
[3:32:01] you're just preaching
[3:32:07] and when the seals are broke
[3:32:11] and then the Mysteries revealed
[3:32:15] it come down it comes down the angel now
[3:32:20] the messenger that Skies
[3:32:24] setting his food

[3:55:24] [Music]
[3:55:29] our heavenly father
[3:55:33] that God who is and The God Who is to
[3:55:35] come
[3:55:37] we are running short of words Lord
[3:55:42] we like to thank you Lord Jesus
[3:55:45] that the Lord indeed you are coming
[3:55:49] we like to thank the father that is the
[3:55:51] pride says
[3:55:53] come Lord Jesus
[3:55:56] father thank you for using our dear
[3:56:00] Pastor gamma
[3:56:03] just to come up father
[3:56:05] clear as other men Lord it is difficult
[3:56:09] from them
[3:56:11] to know and to see
[3:56:13] that where is God hidden himself Lord
[3:56:18] thank you Father for using him Lord
[3:56:21] because father we know that
[3:56:25] there were men father that you used
[3:56:27] before
[3:56:28] because father you are the court Lord
[3:56:31] who's got a contract with the man
[3:56:34] there's nothing further that you do with
[3:56:36] that Lord doing it with a man Lord
[3:56:40] Moses father was the man that you use
[3:56:43] to take out the children of Israel a lot
[3:56:46] from Egypt
[3:56:48] Moses said one day what must I say when
[3:56:51] the people are asking me that who sent
[3:56:54] me
[3:56:56] you said to him Lord tell them that I am
[3:56:59] who I am has sent you
[3:57:03] when he came to the people he said Lord
[3:57:06] to pharaoh
[3:57:07] let my people go

[3:57:13] I am was within him Lord
[3:57:17] gracious Heavenly Father we like to
[3:57:19] thank you Lord that
[3:57:21] there's a man father that we have
[3:57:23] brought at this time and that time like
[3:57:26] this oh Lord

[3:57:31] people
[3:57:32] there is a fail they don't see what is
[3:57:34] happening
[3:57:36] because the father
[3:57:38] even the fathers before Lord
[3:57:42] they've hidden this to the people
[3:57:45] God was there hiding himself father
[3:57:48] behind the vein
[3:57:50] he came foreign
[3:57:54] and the father he veiled himself
[3:57:57] behind the faith he was sitting there in
[3:58:00] his Mississippi Lord
[3:58:02] but father the father's Lord
[3:58:05] couldn't see that who was behind the
[3:58:08] vein
[3:58:09] even today Lord we still have such
[3:58:13] people on the Earth Lord
[3:58:16] which they don't see father where is God
[3:58:19] hiding himself
[3:58:21] but we like to thank you Lord that
[3:58:23] father this is only open to their pride
[3:58:26] it's only open father to those who say
[3:58:29] come Lord and Lord come
