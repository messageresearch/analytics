[10:40] God bless you
[10:43] open from The Book of Revelation chapter
[10:47] 4 verse 1.

[10:57] verse 1 D2
[10:59] are you ready brother God bless you God
[11:02] bless you ready
[11:07] chapter one
[11:09] chapter relation chapter 4 verse 1 to
[11:13] 2.2 after this I looked and behold a
[11:18] door was open in heaven and the first
[11:20] voice which I had was escrow of a
[11:23] trumpet talking with me which said come
[11:27] up hither and I will show these things
[11:29] which must be here after
[11:31] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[11:34] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[11:37] one sat on the throne
[11:39] is
[12:03] God bless you you may be seated it
[12:07] because
[12:13] I'm just looking at this you know
[12:16] subject today
[12:21] since
[12:23] This is the End of Time
[12:28] and
[12:30] we see all the signs
[12:43] uh brother Brennan told us a lot of time
[12:47] about the king about King of the North
[12:50] profession
[12:55] [Music]
[13:00] now what is happening is what the
[13:04] prophet has spoken of and it has started
[13:08] in this way but it is coming after the
[13:12] Rapture this is
[13:17] [Music]
[13:23] so after the Rapture
[13:26] they will see the fullness of it
[13:31] a battle called
[13:39] and there's another one
[13:43] called the battle of Armageddon
[13:48] which will be fought also
[13:52] after tribulation period
[13:58] that one will be fought by the sayings
[14:06] did you know that we as the children of
[14:09] God are an army
[14:18] okay
[14:20] you know
[14:22] we are the army of God
[14:27] this Army chosen out of the seven Church
[14:31] ages
[14:38] yeah I think
[14:40] the bad brother has pulled that towards
[14:43] is it south or north or east I don't
[14:46] know
[14:56] if we have
[15:00] can everybody see this
[15:04] yes now we we
[15:08] remember here
[15:13] our pyramid is installed it's big but
[15:18] pyramid we remember here
[15:28] we have
[15:33] six Church ages
[15:40] five four three two one amen amen six
[15:45] six but all of this
[15:49] Church ages asleep
[15:58] amen amen although we mentioned them but
[16:02] they are not with us they are in the
[16:04] sixth Dimensions
[16:09] they are
[16:11] asleep
[16:15] now I'm going to take it from the
[16:17] prophet here our subject
[16:24] he says when he says let us look a past
[16:28] the curtain of time
[16:36] now we should know that
[16:39] our ministry started not in 19 so and so
[16:43] but before the foundation of the world
[16:56] because this saving chair changes
[17:03] it is time
[17:08] we
[17:11] it is time seven days
[17:16] it's called time ages
[17:32] you have done past the ages
[17:44] we have passed all these days
[17:50] and we're talking with the children of
[17:52] God about what do we call the seventh
[17:56] Church age
[18:07] pertaining to
[18:08] as our time
[18:15] says
[18:17] you will see your time in the pyramid
[18:24] where you are
[18:27] somewhere in this age
[18:32] now all this
[18:43] all of them are asleep
[18:49] and
[18:52] you have
[18:54] select God has selected out of every age
[18:59] what we call the Overcomers
[19:11] do you have an eraser is here or what do
[19:14] you call it
[19:16] can you put for me here the over
[19:29] this sixth
[19:32] ages we have these are all Overcomers
[19:36] down here the Bible says
[19:50] selected out of each age
[19:55] out of this age has overcome us out of
[19:58] this age there's Overcomers
[20:06] like
[20:10] maybe I can read part of it yeah
[20:27] my brother
[20:30] who can be able to do it
[20:34] is
[20:40] can you or the brother read out this
[20:43] this
[20:45] okay
[20:56] Revelation chapter 3 verse if you can
[21:01] speak a bit aloud Revelation chapter 3
[21:04] verse 12 if you guess 21 a bit allowed
[21:09] chapter 3 verse 21 Revelation chapter 3
[21:13] verse 21
[21:16] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[21:20] sit with me in my room even as I also
[21:24] overcame and am sat down with my father
[21:27] in his room
[21:41] right
[21:43] he that Overcomers
[21:48] which age 12.
[22:02] him that overcometh will I make a pillar
[22:06] in the temple of my God and he shall go
[22:09] no more out and I will write upon him
[22:12] the name of my God and the name of the
[22:15] city in my God which is the New
[22:17] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[22:20] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[22:23] him my new name is
[22:52] so there you have he that overcometh he
[22:55] that overcometh he that overcome seven
[22:58] years
[23:07] out of each age there is some Overcomers
[23:18] each age produced twins
[23:31] those who overcame
[23:38] were selected and set aside
[23:43] but now in our age
[23:47] we are the living ones as the Bible says
[23:52] foreign
[24:24] foreign
[24:33] [Music]
[25:19] foreign now from the book
[25:23] yeah
[25:24] let me start where do I get this
[25:28] what it is about
[25:31] subjects
[25:37] it says
[25:41] page 103
[25:44] in this one
[25:48] he says but now in this Sevenfold book
[25:54] of seals
[25:59] of redemption
[26:01] that the Lord took within himself
[26:07] now we are much careful every time when
[26:10] we come to this party
[26:15] because the Bible says
[26:18] the lamb took the book from the one who
[26:22] sat on the throne
[26:28] no Prophet speaking here
[26:31] the Lord took
[26:34] took within the book within himself
[26:45] now it is very much a
[26:49] understood because
[26:55] Jesus says
[26:58] of his father Jesus
[27:07] when they ask him where is your father
[27:10] my father is where
[27:13] you know
[27:19] meaning that the one who had the book on
[27:22] the throne was in him
[27:32] I think
[27:33] it's just too clear and open
[27:38] foreign
[28:12] because he says
[28:16] the first Throne was in heaven
[28:20] the second was in Jesus
[28:37] that's where the third Throne is
[28:42] still one Throne
[28:45] of God Elisha
[28:55] understood that the throne was in Elijah
[29:03] Elijah
[29:07] can't you have a fellowship with us here
[29:10] we are also Brothers he said no
[29:47] as a man but we followed the throne
[30:16] my brother
[30:24] it is in the book here
[30:31] foreign
[31:05] okay okay now here we are we are now I
[31:10] read this part here
[31:13] yes our subject is coming from a minute
[31:20] the book of
[31:22] seals of redemption that the lamp took
[31:27] within himself
[31:35] was the only one who who could do that
[31:39] could do it
[31:42] and he took it from the right hand of
[31:45] him that set upon the throne
[31:52] now to clean
[31:55] Redemptive
[32:03] in the Rapture you can do that brother
[32:05] yes
[32:08] foreign
[32:57] we need to
[33:00] to find the book
[33:04] and because our names
[33:08] are in these books
[33:12] a future home without the cover page
[33:21] it says to claim for me and you could
[33:25] play
[33:28] he redeemed us from
[33:36] really uh
[33:39] back to everything that Adam Lost Boys
[33:52] you know God they can't lose a battle
[34:00] everything that he we have lost he he
[34:04] has redeemed us back to that series
[34:20] my brother
[34:22] that book is without the cover
[34:25] yes
[34:26] thank you
[34:28] all right I mean forgive me I'm sorry I
[34:32] left this in the back okay
[34:36] now here we are now with the lamp with
[34:41] the book in his hands
[34:48] the book was in the hands
[34:56] it is called the book of redemption and
[35:02] and we are ready to assist grace and
[35:05] mercy upon us to open the seventh seal
[35:08] book to us
[35:17] to open the book in Order then he says
[35:21] and let us look at past the curtain of
[35:24] time
[36:24] before we were put in the body there was
[36:27] no starting point
[36:31] now
[37:11] you were created your body
[37:17] your spirit was processed
[37:27] your spirit
[37:29] was not created
[37:32] but your body was created
[37:36] so as he says
[37:40] God in the book who is this melchized
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] God dwells with his
[37:51] attributes
[37:53] with these attributes alone
[38:14] it is his mind that is saying Amen to
[38:17] God
[38:22] why the mind is saying amen because the
[38:24] mind is the mind of God and it was there
[38:27] in God
[38:34] if God says something
[38:37] that mind it says amen
[38:41] because the mind was in him
[38:46] that's why some people cannot say Amen
[38:49] to this message because the message is
[38:53] the mind of God manifested
[38:58] because
[39:06] their mind that is manifested can say
[39:09] Amen
[39:29] you know
[39:31] the first Epistle of John chapter one
[39:36] chapter one that which was from the
[39:39] beginning which we have heard which we
[39:41] have seen with our eyes which we have
[39:44] looked upon and our hands have handled
[39:46] of the word of life right
[39:49] foreign
[40:10] [Music]
[40:46] [Music]
[41:11] foreign
[41:56] that is our title foreign
[42:04] [Music]
[42:09] the book or the title Deeds
[42:27] of the Mysteries
[42:31] to bring them to his
[42:35] amen
[42:39] [Music]
[42:45] all right we know
[42:49] let's put this a bit here
[42:53] now I'm going back to our scripture
[43:00] the voice said to him
[43:03] here
[43:09] that's in your Bible Revelation chapter
[43:12] 4 verse
[43:21] I will show you things to come
[43:29] now
[43:31] sobano I think this page 92 in this
[43:34] series
[43:35] books
[43:41] in this Vision Vision
[43:44] in another Vision it is in page 92.
[43:53] shall I read it brother
[43:56] I have read it
[44:07] standing up here in heaven
[44:13] being lifted up now from the church ages
[44:21] when he cried out
[44:27] it was from
[44:30] the church Ages
[44:33] come up here from the church ages
[44:40] he has been lifted up Joy yeah
[44:47] come up here
[44:51] is
[44:53] a place
[44:59] from here I will show you
[45:07] which you cannot see unless you come up
[45:10] yes
[45:14] the things I want to show you cannot be
[45:18] seen from where you are
[45:22] you need to come up
[45:25] here
[45:29] I don't mean here in salima
[45:34] he was standing somewhere over here
[45:40] all right
[45:42] then from here I will show you things to
[45:46] come
[45:47] on
[45:51] I think Revelation chapter
[45:55] is it chapter 9.
[46:01] I mean 21 verse 9.
[46:10] and they came unto me one of the Seven
[46:13] Angels which had the seven vials full of
[46:16] the seven last plagues and talked with
[46:19] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[46:23] the bride the Lamb's wife foreign
[47:01] and then he showed him what yeah
[47:08] verse 10
[47:09] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[47:12] a great and high mountain and showed me
[47:15] that great City the holy Jerusalem
[47:17] descending Out of Heaven from God
[47:24] um
[47:33] he showed me
[47:36] a great City
[47:40] but he said
[47:50] the bride is made like
[47:53] the city
[47:58] the city
[48:24] Resurrection people they will reside on
[48:27] the
[48:28] outside the of the city
[48:35] they won't be in the cities
[48:38] and the Bible says they shall come in
[48:41] out in out
[48:46] but they will never recite them
[48:51] all right
[48:53] God bless you uh the bride
[48:58] now I'm looking at this
[49:02] all right I'll carry on
[49:07] come up here I will show you the bride
[49:14] and he led him to air high mountains
[49:20] to show him the bride
[49:26] I repeat the results
[49:35] the bride is built like the city
[49:41] that's why he says the pyramid now
[49:44] who is coming to a sharp
[49:48] points
[49:51] and that's why we are in the minority
[49:57] did you know that
[50:00] you're in the minority
[50:04] now we are not about talking about the
[50:08] the message churches we are talking
[50:11] about the pride
[50:19] amen amen from where I come from we have
[50:24] messages
[50:43] the bread is not in pieces
[50:47] the bright is the word of God
[50:52] I mean you can chop it into pieces
[50:58] we have here seven pieces of the Bride
[51:09] foreign
[52:40] [Music]
[52:50] God unfolding until he he was a man
[52:54] among men
[52:56] foreign
[53:34] Genesis
[53:43] all right so so we are looking at this
[53:49] let me read I I haven't finished
[53:56] and John in the spirit
[54:02] the revelation of the Seven Seals page
[54:04] 90.
[54:06] the revelation of the civilizations
[54:18] he's just being lifted up now
[54:21] from the church ages
[54:30] and you see he saw Church ages
[54:36] and then he was taken up
[54:45] um
[54:59] because he said
[55:01] I will show you the bride
[55:05] the Lamb's wife
[55:15] now for few moments
[55:20] God typed this with Abraham
[55:28] the Bible says we are the Seed of
[55:31] Abraham
[55:34] and the Seed of Abraham is Christ
[55:41] have you ever read that Galatians
[55:59] Colossians chapter 3 verse 16
[56:05] now to Abraham and his seat where the
[56:08] promise made
[56:10] he said not to the to seeds as of many
[56:14] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[56:19] Christ right now
[56:34] amen amen
[56:37] Abraham
[56:50] we
[56:57] have the bride
[57:01] some are yes
[57:47] the bride of Christ
[57:58] [Music]
[58:02] the bride
[58:05] amen amen
[58:07] God
[58:09] who has got not many wives
[58:16] uh
[58:18] what do you call it
[58:20] distribution
[58:25] was there
[58:27] before
[58:33] even
[58:36] Moses allowed them
[58:40] remember
[58:42] when the Lord Jesus arrived
[58:51] he said he who made them made them
[58:54] husband
[58:56] and wives
[59:04] did they say wives
[59:14] because of the hardness of their hearts
[59:16] Moses allowed them to take wives
[59:25] because
[59:28] you you always see a long queue of men
[59:33] coming to complain
[59:35] at the office of Moses
[59:45] [Music]
[59:47] next
[59:49] Moses would say next
[59:54] amen amen
[59:59] again
[1:00:25] until maybe they are fifty hundred and
[1:00:28] so 100.
[1:00:33] if they are 50
[1:00:35] the man has got 50 problems
[1:00:46] you you take 50 wives
[1:00:54] That's why God gave you only one
[1:01:00] even his wife
[1:01:08] all right
[1:01:12] now yeah I can't talk about the other
[1:01:16] things in other doctrines
[1:01:20] yeah we are a family talking of the
[1:01:23] things that God has allotted we are the
[1:01:26] father family
[1:01:33] because a brother came to me from
[1:01:35] another country and said where brother
[1:01:39] godima is it wrong to take the second
[1:01:41] wife
[1:01:49] I said brother
[1:01:51] I will take the second one the day the
[1:01:54] Lord has taken the second one as long as
[1:01:58] he has the bride then I have the bride
[1:02:01] is
[1:02:15] but I said I don't interfere in some
[1:02:18] other people's
[1:02:19] uh doctrines
[1:02:27] I know I preached somewhere
[1:02:32] I thought I was preaching against
[1:02:39] sinus
[1:02:43] running around with women
[1:02:51] and then I realized afterwards
[1:02:54] no longer wanted in that area because of
[1:02:58] that
[1:03:04] I know it very well yes I don't want to
[1:03:08] see me again
[1:03:11] but I was not talking against any person
[1:03:22] you know sometimes you know a brother
[1:03:26] was preaching
[1:03:28] or complaining
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:34] he's preaching about me
[1:03:38] but actually you you aimed at the Devil
[1:03:42] yeah
[1:04:00] so they don't want to see me and yeah
[1:04:06] as long as I am sin of God
[1:04:16] I was reading to the children of God
[1:04:21] a scripture where
[1:04:26] for
[1:04:30] uh
[1:04:32] foreign
[1:05:00] foreign
[1:05:04] you know
[1:05:06] that is the token
[1:05:08] yeah
[1:05:11] of the Covenant
[1:05:15] the token of the Covenants
[1:05:25] and chapter 9 of Genesis
[1:05:35] I will put a bow in the sky
[1:05:42] and I will look upon the ball yes
[1:05:47] then I will forgive my people
[1:05:52] so God did not look at them
[1:06:12] if I'm found to be in Christ
[1:06:16] that's where God can see
[1:06:22] if you are in Christ God can see you
[1:06:29] we are in Christ
[1:06:33] Jesus Christ
[1:06:44] called from before the foundation of the
[1:06:47] world
[1:07:49] foreign because we we are the Seed of
[1:07:53] Abraham
[1:07:55] according to the word of God
[1:07:59] all right
[1:08:03] the throne the Throne of God
[1:08:10] he brought forth a sign
[1:08:13] and in this pyramid more pyramid is
[1:08:19] seven steps
[1:08:20] Yahoo
[1:08:25] foreign
[1:08:57] from
[1:09:06] Adam
[1:09:10] is
[1:09:12] your seventh man from Adam
[1:09:19] now if you look at these numbers
[1:09:23] like you take the pyramid itself
[1:09:29] the man who raised that structure is
[1:09:32] Enoch structures
[1:09:42] amen he was responsible for the
[1:09:45] structure the pyramid
[1:09:48] s and
[1:09:54] in the
[1:09:55] pyramidity
[1:09:57] you have some
[1:10:00] shaft pointing out
[1:10:05] to zodiac oh now it is
[1:10:10] now when they studied that
[1:10:14] they saw that
[1:10:17] whoever was responsible for the pyramid
[1:10:26] he received
[1:10:28] his measurements from Zodiacs
[1:10:39] that's why scientists today cannot build
[1:10:42] a pyramid
[1:10:48] because the measurements
[1:10:51] were received from Zodiac
[1:10:56] Zodiac Zodiac each of the shaft if they
[1:10:59] look through that shaft
[1:11:02] is pointing out to a certain stars
[1:11:09] because the stars are preachers
[1:11:16] working now the pyramids
[1:11:20] this is seven steps
[1:11:24] another very important thing is
[1:11:38] and even scientists today they cannot
[1:11:41] interpret the pyramids
[1:11:46] now when the seventh man
[1:11:50] from
[1:11:51] Paul
[1:11:57] Adam was the seventh from Adam
[1:12:04] messenger from Paul
[1:12:11] brother
[1:12:13] now are we together
[1:12:16] I don't know what happened
[1:12:19] okay
[1:12:21] while you are going back let me put it
[1:12:23] to you
[1:12:27] was the seventh man from Adam
[1:12:37] s
[1:12:47] responsible for the structure
[1:12:53] but the interpretation of the uh pyramid
[1:12:58] came with pyramid
[1:13:03] because that one is the seventh from
[1:13:05] adamant
[1:13:16] okay okay God bless you
[1:13:20] now we are in the seventh Church age
[1:13:25] this seventh church
[1:13:29] I will read to you you know I have read
[1:13:32] that before
[1:13:40] you you will always
[1:13:43] read with me these things
[1:13:49] oh I am returning to the book of rapture
[1:13:58] uh
[1:14:00] you know
[1:14:03] brother did you know that the seventh
[1:14:05] Church age
[1:14:10] is the only church age left
[1:14:16] the other Church ages that are appearing
[1:14:19] and we are talking about them and
[1:14:21] they're missing Messengers are in the
[1:14:24] sixth dimensions
[1:14:32] I think the brother is still going to
[1:14:34] think about it because
[1:14:45] so he will find us from
[1:14:50] Adam
[1:14:56] yes he says Noah but you know the
[1:15:00] prophet is talking about Adam yeah
[1:15:11] but
[1:15:15] which was type of the church ages
[1:15:22] six men before him died
[1:15:39] there's no doubt
[1:15:42] in the seventh Church
[1:15:58] we are waiting for them
[1:16:02] we just paid them a visit
[1:16:05] Dimensions
[1:16:12] you know we like the messenger who went
[1:16:15] before we are the writers
[1:16:25] followed the men who went in before
[1:16:32] even Moses met God before
[1:16:37] then he went to the children of Israel
[1:16:43] I have met God
[1:16:47] now he has the news from God
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:57] I mean
[1:17:00] I'm talking about this one now
[1:17:07] who else who went in first what do you
[1:17:10] mean
[1:17:12] the bride
[1:17:18] as I was with Moses
[1:17:31] amen as I was with Moses
[1:17:35] so shall I be with you
[1:17:38] foreign
[1:18:30] to the Eagle's Nest
[1:18:32] inside amen
[1:18:36] to tell them that
[1:18:38] the seals are open
[1:18:42] amen amen he goes in first
[1:18:47] because as a pasta
[1:18:55] that's why we are told in the olden days
[1:19:02] a Shepherd did not come from
[1:19:04] did what did not work
[1:19:07] behind the ship
[1:19:14] pardon pardon let me not uh the
[1:19:18] shepherdisha you'll remind me today how
[1:19:22] they do it
[1:19:23] the shepherd is behind it
[1:19:28] in the olden days
[1:19:45] the shepherd did not push the Sheep Musa
[1:19:55] that's why Jesus says
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:03] God bless you yes
[1:20:05] now we are on track now
[1:20:10] I am the way
[1:20:16] now the way you don't follow you
[1:20:24] and he says I am the shepherd
[1:20:29] a good one too
[1:20:41] it's something else
[1:20:47] that's why today
[1:20:50] you know a Shepherd would know
[1:20:54] if he had 50 ships
[1:21:05] you will count 50.
[1:21:14] is that how it works
[1:21:20] they followed the Shepherds
[1:21:23] because it is the shepherd Chicago
[1:21:34] and see whether it is free to lead the
[1:21:37] ship in or Not
[1:21:47] by the time he arrives
[1:21:57] I mean if he goes behind
[1:22:00] hey you must help me if I'm I'm going
[1:22:03] astray
[1:22:29] if they go foreign
[1:23:04] is I'm losing this is the last time
[1:23:12] Enoch was raptured
[1:23:18] I was showing that it is the seventh
[1:23:21] Church age that takes
[1:23:23] the Rapture foreign
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] because they are there
[1:23:55] paid them a visit
[1:24:02] he was told
[1:24:04] when you want to see
[1:24:07] the other side
[1:24:13] says
[1:24:36] and he says there was no yesterday then
[1:24:42] we were all
[1:24:44] he finds himself also being young
[1:24:51] and that place but they are waiting for
[1:24:54] us
[1:24:58] that he said I want to see Jesus
[1:25:14] one day he will come
[1:25:17] and he will come and together with him
[1:25:22] we will come down
[1:25:37] you know I think
[1:25:40] it is visible
[1:25:44] we we are the seventh Church age
[1:25:58] let us go our past
[1:26:03] Decatur of times
[1:26:09] is also
[1:26:11] foreign
[1:26:18] ers seals are open

[1:26:45] the seventh Church age
