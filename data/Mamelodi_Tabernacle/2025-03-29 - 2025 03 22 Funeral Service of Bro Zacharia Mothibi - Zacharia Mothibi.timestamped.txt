[44:02] jacket in your
[44:07] car I will come back with
[44:11] [Music]
[44:14] it then he never managed to come
[44:20] back in24
[44:27] then started not feeling
[44:34] well I called him but he then informed
[44:36] me that I'm actually
[44:43] sick I said what is troubling
[44:47] you he said
[44:52] look the doctor said I had an I have an
[44:56] issue with my liver

[45:45] you in the name of Jesus
[45:50] Christ uh thank for the
[45:53] opportunity to come and just talk a
[45:56] short about my
[45:59] friend yesterday you have heard or you
[46:02] were
[46:05] informed
[46:06] that was once
[46:11] arrested I think he was arrested because
[46:14] he was at the wrong place with the wrong
[46:20] people I don't think he was part of
[46:25] that amen amen then uh and he moved to
[46:31] another
[46:33] school where he met
[46:36] me and then we start friendship
[46:40] there amen amen
[46:43] so indeed he was a man a good
[46:49] man I know
[46:52] [Music]
[46:53] brother both sides
[46:57] before and after being a message
[47:02] believer amen amen he he played an
[47:06] essential
[47:09] role H for what I am
[47:14] today and I think he is very much
[47:19] happy that he he talked to
[47:24] somebody that today is
[47:28] something in what he was preaching in by
[47:33] his
[47:35] life amen amen
[47:39] so we were boys when we
[47:45] met at gr
[47:47] 10 at today's
[47:51] language then it was standard 10
[47:57] yes if I put it correctly not standard
[47:59] 10 stand standard eight form three let
[48:03] me put this way form three yes yeah we
[48:06] were together doing form
[48:10] three yes the other speak was genius in
[48:15] in
[48:20] books but we competing with him
[48:24] sometimes I will surpass you
[48:28] yeah he he he was aware that I'm doing
[48:31] very well he could do in
[48:35] biology but he cannot outside me in my
[48:39] mother
[48:43] time maybe he can do well in
[48:47] history but I will do well in
[48:51] geography we can do well in uh
[48:55] agriculture
[48:57] agure yeah we learn
[49:00] agriculture I was thinking that you know
[49:02] when you were still young and you at the
[49:05] school they will try to teach you
[49:08] everything life skill you know so that
[49:12] when you are grown up you are able to
[49:15] choose but uh that's how we
[49:19] were amen amen now we we grw
[49:24] together and then until
[49:28] today now I didn't know the suffering of
[49:33] my brother in as the the other speakers
[49:38] said because he was close to
[49:41] me he could share
[49:44] everything I even advise him to go other
[49:49] doctors when he came from this doctor he
[49:52] said to
[49:53] me you know this doctor of yours I don't
[49:57] like
[49:59] you because he told me things that I
[50:02] don't want to listen to
[50:04] hear I said you know my
[50:07] friend you need to do exactly what he
[50:09] has told you to
[50:11] do amen amen but then we were giving
[50:16] advice each
[50:17] other yes and you know if I'm not well
[50:23] you will come and pick me up
[50:27] if he's not well I'll come and pick him
[50:30] up I will also drive him wherever I
[50:33] wants to drive him he wants to
[50:36] drive yes we have family
[50:41] friends amen amen now the good things
[50:44] brother MV
[50:46] is the good thing about
[50:50] him I I won't say was because he's not
[50:53] dead He's Alive
[50:57] he is listening us attentively as we
[50:59] speak right
[51:01] now because what I'm saying I'm a
[51:04] witness to
[51:05] it I know when a person comes out of
[51:08] this
[51:09] body where he goes to he's still alive
[51:13] he sees and he
[51:14] yes I'm not just saying
[51:17] because I I believe the the scriptures I
[51:23] am a beli of the scriptures and I live
[51:25] for them
[51:28] amen amen now what I'm saying is truth
[51:31] and it remain truth like
[51:34] that amen amen
[51:40] now he he is he was just like
[51:45] that amen amen
[51:48] we the brother has intimidated me
[51:52] because I I yeah let me leave that way H
[51:57] that's how he is
[51:59] brother and that's how we we we
[52:02] lived now the Bible
[52:08] says amen amen chapter 12 chapter 12 he
[52:12] says we need to seek the face of God
[52:16] while we're still
[52:20] young and then that's what brother mtiv
[52:24] did because the Bible say says again in
[52:28] verse
[52:29] two that when you need to seek him when
[52:34] there are no where the stars and the
[52:37] moon and the sun are still
[52:41] shining because the time of darkness
[52:46] comes so brother did
[52:49] that and he also bring it to
[52:52] me so that when I in 19 86 we I I took
[52:58] this decision to to do exactly what he
[53:00] was
[53:03] doing then he showed me the
[53:07] light and then I followed that light I
[53:10] remember I was another church I said you
[53:13] know what your
[53:15] church is exactly the same as
[53:18] mine then he said
[53:21] no just come in and
[53:24] listen and then after some time
[53:27] and then I realized that yeah there's a
[53:29] difference here because this was calling
[53:32] what is in
[53:35] me I'm a person that once I see
[53:40] something I won't lose
[53:43] it he was very
[53:47] humble but those who know me my
[53:50] character but we managed to
[53:53] blend God bless you
[53:57] thank you
[53:58] amen God bless you
[54:01] sir uh to all speakers I I am fairly
[54:04] allocating 5 minutes for every speaker

[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:37] greetings my name
[1:04:41] is brother
[1:04:44] Z brother Zakaria was my uncle however
[1:04:47] we didn't grow up
[1:04:51] as being my uncle he was my dad
[1:04:57] because
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:02] mothers so we were all fortunate enough
[1:05:05] to have two
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:15] parents I'll read the speech here and
[1:05:18] here it goes
[1:05:23] amen my sons
[1:05:28] I'm asking you to take care of
[1:05:31] Mama respect her and don't undermine
[1:05:37] her our uncle chose that you should
[1:05:39] remain taking good care of
[1:05:42] her I'm asking that you take care of
[1:05:49] her my uncle didn't leave children but
[1:05:52] he left the wife and and
[1:05:56] and
[1:06:00] children take care of your
[1:06:08] mother you must take care of your
[1:06:14] mother was the true
[1:06:20] Victory your absence will definitely
[1:06:22] make us feel desolate and bed
[1:06:30] but as a Roman philosopher once
[1:06:35] said what is
[1:06:38] death a scary
[1:06:42] mask take it
[1:06:46] off it doesn't
[1:06:49] bite eventually the
[1:06:52] body and the soul
[1:06:55] will have to
[1:06:57] separate just as it was before we were
[1:07:03] born so why be upset
[1:07:08] now if it happens
[1:07:12] now because if it isn't
[1:07:16] now it is
[1:07:19] later and I would also like to express

[1:41:56] Saints were seen by many amen amen after
[1:42:02] our Lord Jesus
[1:42:03] Christ cried with a loud
[1:42:06] voice when he cried with a loud
[1:42:10] voice it was just not a normal
[1:42:13] voice it was a special
[1:42:17] voice and since the world
[1:42:19] began there was never a cry like that
[1:42:23] there was never a voice like that a
[1:42:27] voice when he
[1:42:29] uttered when he yielded up the
[1:42:33] goat when he died on the
[1:42:35] cross many things have happened that has
[1:42:39] never happened before as we read here
[1:42:43] the
[1:42:44] veil since was
[1:42:47] done many years ago when the veil hear
[1:42:52] the cry
[1:42:54] and the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:58] rented
[1:43:01] into amen many people

[1:43:24] intact but when Jesus
[1:43:27] Christ Ed that voice that Veil rent
[1:43:33] into it was not an Ordinary
[1:43:36] Day from top to bottom the Earth
[1:43:43] shook amen the
[1:43:46] Rocks
[1:43:48] rent that was the voice of Jesus Christ
[1:43:52] when he yielded up
[1:43:54] the amen it didn't end there the graves
[1:43:59] were
[1:44:01] open hallelujah amen when the graves
[1:44:04] were open make bodies of the Saints
[1:44:09] which slept
[1:44:11] arose because of the voice of Jesus
[1:44:14] Christ there was a reason for them and
[1:44:17] when we die they take us to the same
[1:44:20] graveyard as any other people
[1:44:24] but when the Resurrection come it's only
[1:44:27] for the special
[1:44:28] people it's only for the
[1:44:31] Saints only the Saints rose up the
[1:44:37] remained in the grave and the Bible says
[1:44:41] those saints that rose up walked in
[1:44:46] Jerusalem and many have seen them if one
[1:44:51] day you started to see your loved one
[1:44:55] who departed come and have a lunch with
[1:44:59] you come and have a dinner with you come
[1:45:02] and walk with you and the only thing
[1:45:06] that he can tells you is the things of
[1:45:09] beyond
[1:45:11] the he he will tell you what is
[1:45:14] happening you you will have comfort from
[1:45:17] him because he will tell you that yes we
[1:45:21] wake up we have heard the voice we have
[1:45:25] had the Cry of our Lord Jesus Christ of
[1:45:28] our creator and they Rose they started
[1:45:31] to walk
[1:45:34] around amen since the world
[1:45:37] began this has never happened it was
[1:45:41] only in the time of Jesus and that was
[1:45:45] the first
[1:45:46] fruit and that will never stop there
[1:45:50] that should happen again before the
[1:45:53] reptor takes place before we go up the
[1:45:58] graves must open the dead should rise
[1:46:04] and we should spend time with
[1:46:06] them reason why
[1:46:12] took you know it's for what it's for him
[1:46:17] he he is the sign of the
[1:46:20] Rapture he is the sign of the Rapture
[1:46:24] when Rapture is about to happen we will
[1:46:28] see him he will come to his house he

[1:46:34] kids he will greet the church he will
[1:46:37] tell them within 40
[1:46:43] days you know those that go before
[1:46:46] us we mustn't cry but we must know that
[1:46:51] it is the our
[1:46:54] the sign of the Rapture is when The
[1:46:57] Departed s come to life again greet us

[1:47:14] departed and I must stand to to say a
[1:47:17] word of
[1:47:19] comfort come to me the reason why he go

[1:47:37] families with the children of God they
[1:47:40] were telling them within 40 days we go

[1:54:54] characteristics of
[1:54:57] God I said it

[1:55:12] characteristics of God they are in

[1:55:21] question and answer
[1:55:24] what brother Bram says he said he was
[1:55:27] crucified died Rose the third day was on
[1:55:32] Earth 40
[1:55:34] days men after he risen ascended up into
[1:55:41] heaven told them to wait until they seen
[1:55:44] the kingdom of God come upon them at
[1:55:48] this time the
[1:55:50] father will Resto the kingdom in a
[1:55:54] spiritual form to
[1:55:56] them they went up to the city of
[1:55:59] Jerusalem waited there for 10 days and
[1:56:04] night and all of a sudden the baptism of
[1:56:07] the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God come
[1:56:11] with power upon them is that right
[1:56:14] brother Bram trying to tell us for 40
[1:56:17] days when Jesus was on Earth after he
[1:56:21] reison
[1:56:22] the Saints has
[1:56:24] resurrected they waited another 10
[1:56:27] days because
[1:56:30] Pentecost
[1:56:32] juilee 50
[1:56:35] number on the 50th
[1:56:38] day came again upon them his Jubilee
[1:56:44] time and they receive him as the pillar
[1:56:47] of fire brother here says every one of
[1:56:51] us
[1:56:52] every one of us children of God we have
[1:56:55] the guardian
[1:56:57] angel there's an angel that is
[1:57:00] always looking after you when you want
[1:57:04] to do wrong that angel stopped you when
[1:57:08] brother Bram was a young man wanted to
[1:57:12] do many wrongs but the guardian angel
[1:57:16] that God has prepared for him stopped
[1:57:19] him until he was perfect before
[1:57:26] God the guardian angel is only for the
[1:57:29] children of God because the guardian
[1:57:32] angel is the one that behold the face
[1:57:37] of those are your representation
[1:57:41] in amen amen let's
[1:57:44] continue there's no such a
[1:57:47] thing as tiring meeting
[1:57:55] you have been an
[1:57:57] ER doesn't means
[1:58:00] pray t means to wait after the
[1:58:04] Ascension after Jesus Christ the
[1:58:08] crucifixion the cleansing of the
[1:58:10] sanctuary and after the day of the
[1:58:14] atonement the Resurrection the day of
[1:58:18] atonement when he was killed then it's
[1:58:21] 40 days
[1:58:23] until the Ascension and then
[1:58:26] Pentecost the word Pentecost means
[1:58:30] 5050
[1:58:33] days offering of the
[1:58:36] at amen amen in the Old
[1:58:40] Testament there were
[1:58:43] sacrifices That Couldn't cleans your
[1:58:48] sin and your iniquities
[1:58:52] and your
[1:58:54] transgression but it was a
[1:58:56] covering through the
[1:58:59] blood until the real
[1:59:01] blood of the Lamb come as an
[1:59:06] atonement between you and God that is
[1:59:10] why when he died on the cross he was
[1:59:14] between the Heaven and the
[1:59:16] Earth for him to be the
[1:59:19] gateway to heaven when you believe the
[1:59:22] Lord Jesus Christ you believed his blood
[1:59:26] has cleansed you you are on the way to
[1:59:31] heaven amen amen and then on the
[1:59:36] 50th the same Jesus who
[1:59:41] ascended descended again to his church
[1:59:45] the day of Pentecost then that's when he
[1:59:49] started to build his brother
[1:59:52] when we speak about the Bride of Jesus

[2:03:56] guidance and the angel said to him

[2:16:41] time and next to the sixth Dimension is
[2:16:45] the seventh Dimension and God took the
[2:16:48] fifth
[2:16:49] dimension underneath the world so two
[2:16:53] World
[2:16:54] apart one the Bible says that one who
[2:16:59] used to report you before God does not
[2:17:04] have chance
[2:17:06] any our God is a good god Our God work
[2:17:10] with
[2:17:11] dispensation there was a time where God
[2:17:14] allowed the devil to report you
[2:17:18] to have you seen brother
[2:17:21] have you seen sister God allowed there
[2:17:25] but today is not allowed devil and the
[2:17:29] Sinners do not have access to the sixth
[2:17:32] Dimension or the seventh Dimension
[2:17:35] anymore that Dimension is right the
[2:17:38] fifth one and the fifth one is the
[2:17:43] underworld that is The Fifth Dimension
[2:17:47] no one from The Fifth Dimension can go
[2:17:50] to to the sixth Dimension but the people
[2:17:53] in the sixth Dimension can go to The
[2:17:55] Fifth
[2:17:59] Dimension you know after God has done
[2:18:01] all these things he allowed the children
[2:18:04] of God you know after living
[2:18:07] this Amen to go anywhere
[2:18:12] anytime you can see them with a naked
[2:18:16] eye but when was say I don't remember
[2:18:21] yes
[2:18:23] he he's looking at us do you know that
[2:18:27] that is true he's looking at us he's in
[2:18:31] another body we don't see him he is
[2:18:34] seeing him and he is thinking this
[2:18:37] message that after receiving this
[2:18:40] message has taken me to the better place
[2:18:43] he is in a better place where he is he
[2:18:48] said Lord God make it quick huh
[2:18:51] let those people come quick yet because
[2:18:55] where we are we enjoy ourselves it
[2:18:58] happen exactly to brother BR let's
[2:19:01] follow this message this message is a
[2:19:04] reality God took brother
[2:19:07] BR the sixth Dimension when he was there
[2:19:11] then he said Lord God I'm not going back
[2:19:14] there I'm not going back to that c no no
[2:19:18] no no no then God said to him I brought
[2:19:21] you here to taste this when you go back
[2:19:26] you can be able to tell them what you
[2:19:30] have seen what you have heard so that
[2:19:34] when they believe they see what you
[2:19:38] please unto them now brother Bram when
[2:19:41] he comes back he came back with the
[2:19:44] Assurance he said to the church I saw
[2:19:47] you there you know we were just walking
[2:19:51] in the world here while walking the
[2:19:54] world here but brother Bram come and
[2:19:57] said to us I have
[2:20:00] seen when when we work we work for that
[2:20:05] Bo has seen there brother BR God took
[2:20:10] him again to The Fifth Dimension to the
[2:20:14] under to the hell that is not burning
[2:20:17] when he get there he saw the people one
[2:20:21] day when he was walking he saw the
[2:20:24] people he has seen there and he said to
[2:20:27] the church saw these people down there
[2:20:31] this ministry that we are following is
[2:20:34] beyond our thinking is the ministry that
[2:20:38] can show us what is happening in hell
[2:20:42] what is happening in
[2:20:45] heaven this morning let me be honest
[2:20:48] with you already all of us
[2:20:51] we know where we are going we know who
[2:20:53] we are we know our stand with Christ if
[2:20:57] you are the citizen of the underworld I
[2:21:00] cannot take you to heaven if you are the
[2:21:03] citizen of Heaven I cannot take you
[2:21:06] below there's a complete
[2:21:09] job son but I have Assurance this
[2:21:12] morning that our Elder M TV young
[2:21:18] again I want to tell you this if there
[2:21:21] is heaven to go if there is heaven to go
[2:21:26] is in heaven we are just going to take
[2:21:29] the body to the Grave where it belong
[2:21:33] but the soul has reached the
[2:21:37] Destin the day
[2:21:41] disintegrate hallelujah amen when Jesus
[2:21:45] Christ died on the cross the Bible says
[2:21:50] the flesh was in the grave everybody
[2:21:54] sees on the grave Mary was crying Peter
[2:21:58] went back to
[2:22:00] fish and the others lie they don't want
[2:22:03] to associate themselves with because
[2:22:06] they see the Flesh in the grave they
[2:22:09] lost hope but there was
[2:22:12] alive beyond the grave when you go
[2:22:16] beyond the grave when you go to the
[2:22:18] spiritual reality
[2:22:20] the Bible says his
[2:22:23] spirit amen went back to
[2:22:27] God his soul go to the
[2:22:31] uttermost when it get there brothers and
[2:22:35] sisters I normally say this I
[2:22:38] will when you have hit the point of no
[2:22:43] return no one can help
[2:22:47] you amen he soul
[2:22:51] a soul is a
[2:22:53] being amen it's a body
[2:22:58] structure but a spirit is a breath of
[2:23:02] life but a flesh is this
[2:23:05] body because the soul of Jesus
[2:23:08] Christ went down when it get down there
[2:23:13] it
[2:23:14] preaches to the lost
[2:23:18] soul not for their repent
[2:23:21] they have heit the point of no
[2:23:24] return even if they hear the word of God
[2:23:28] they will never
[2:23:31] repent for here the Bible says the
[2:23:36] Centurion when he see the the the
[2:23:42] veil when he see the
[2:23:45] earthquake when he see the sun and the
[2:23:47] Stars
[2:23:48] responding when he see the people rising
[2:23:51] from the
[2:23:53] grave the
[2:23:54] Centurion The Sinner
[2:23:57] Centurion he turned back and said indeed
[2:24:03] he was the son of God indeed he was the
[2:24:07] son of God has never helped
[2:24:09] him has never taken to Heaven he
[2:24:13] remained a sin so the word of God is not
[2:24:17] going to change us the word of God
[2:24:21] is just going to make better
[2:24:25] us if you are a
[2:24:28] sinner you are a better
[2:24:31] sinner if you are a Christian you become
[2:24:34] better
[2:24:35] Christian that's what the word of God
[2:24:37] came
[2:24:39] here amen amen there's no longer time
[2:24:42] for
[2:24:43] repentance we have HIIT the point
[2:24:47] of we have taken our way
[2:24:51] the word of God is like a
[2:24:53] magnet it
[2:24:56] down
[2:24:58] amongst if you are all the same material
[2:25:02] you catch on it if it's not the same
[2:25:05] material you repel and
[2:25:10] Fa if I have a Ste an
[2:25:14] iron
[2:25:16] magnet the aluminium will never catch
[2:25:21] if I need the steel only the steel
[2:25:25] will amen am if the word of God is the
[2:25:30] magnet and coming down those magnet has
[2:25:34] the pieces on
[2:25:36] Earth they will click to the
[2:25:40] magnet if you are a child of God to
[2:25:43] begin with when the word of God is being
[2:25:47] preached you just catch up
[2:25:54] one day Paul was preaching the
[2:25:58] whole when he was prison the whole life
[2:26:01] a young man fell and
[2:26:04] Di amen amen since you have heard about
[2:26:08] that it was it ended there he died Paul
[2:26:13] prayed for him he rise that did not make
[2:26:17] him a Christian if he was a sinner he
[2:26:20] will go back to the school of
[2:26:23] keming and tell them that hey that
[2:26:26] church is so dangerous you die to raise
[2:26:30] you that is not going to make him a
[2:26:32] Christian and he will never go to that
[2:26:34] church again because that church is not
[2:26:38] for him if the word of God is not for
[2:26:41] you we can pray we can fast we can try
[2:26:46] it's nothing is going to change in our
[2:26:48] lives we have all hit the point of no
