[Music] but what is in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus the people [Music] the people are saying [Music] [Music] [Music] only now I want to read [Music] [Applause] [Music] now let let us [Music] [Applause] ask are you the only only one who has the word are you the only one who has thew answers here is [Music] the which the word came to the prophet then heed [Applause] [Music] [Music] to Elijah elah knew that he also can receive what am now if we can believe Christ and as he says that day shall know know you know when you have eaten that you have eaten because food is in [Music] [Applause] you I know that I have a heart [Music] P I don't need somebody to preach to me that Hallelujah you have [Music] hand so Jesus says that day shall know I am [Music] in that is this day we know he says if the church only knew it [Music] position know the church must know said they say to you go and wait for the Min birthday and you don't know [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what why because you don't know how [Music] the if now you are told to wait for the coming of the [Applause] Lord you must know if you don't know him the Lord will be passing this way [Applause] and [Music]
