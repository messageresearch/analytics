Who has deacons and so forth. and everything. But you see, God set in the church for perfecting of the church. Man has deacons. God has pastors. Amen. What are we doing? We identify the gift in a man. Amen. After identifying the gift in a man, then we say this is a pastor because we have seen the gift of pastorship in this man. Amen. You see the man who has a gift is the man who is running from that gift. It's not the man who say I am. Amen. Are you together with me? Are you listening? Amen. Amen. He says in the book of revelation, book of symbols 58 58 he said the pastor is a shepherd. He says the Holy Ghost. He don't say man. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer. Who made over here? Amen. Where do you come in? Overseer of his church. Unless that church is not God's church. It is not God's church. You can choose your own pastor. Amen. Boys nowadays they raise their hands. I'm a pastor. Hey, choose me. I want to be a pastor. Because he want money. He's making this a post. A pastor from God, he can pastor four or five people. Those who didn't have money, those don't have those who don't have money because he's a pastor. He is looking over the souls, not over the pockets. Amen. He is the Holy Ghost made him an overseer. Amen. Is it me who says this? The Holy Ghost has made him an overseer. Amen. over his church, the flock to feed them with what? The word of God. Amen. I will give you pastors who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. Amen. A sheep without a shepherd is a [Music] parame is a lost sheep. A sheep cannot guide itself. It needs a shepherd. Amen. A shepherd. Christ is the shepherd. Amen. To shepherd his sheep, he needs a man. Let me read something here for you to understand. It says here, what do we do? We identified the gift. I have identified the gift. In fact, if the church has identified the gift, they must go to the pastor of a church. They must they must go there. They must tell the pastor we have identified the gift in this brother. We want this brother to be the pastor because we have seen that gift and the pastor will say give me chance. I'm still going to look [Music] at if you really want the pastor. Amen. Give the pastor chance. You must pray over your request. He must see what you are seeing. Then we come back to you. What did you want? you what did what did you want us to orain the pastor because I also agree with you are you together but if you just bring a man a pastor this man we just ordain the man because you say he's a pastor it's Not us, but you ask us. Then the prophet says here, now the Bible times, the way they ordain a minister was by recognizing a gift of God in this minister. or ministering. Is it me? Okay. If it's not me, then they notice him being a staunch Christian and also a gift of speaking. That here is talking about Timote. They say, "And they laid hands upon him as a recognition." They recognize now. Are you together? Amen. That is what I'm going to do. Elders told me that they have already done the the other process. I I'm just going to [Music] ordain. But before I ordain, I must tell you who is the pastor. Amen. And I have told you who is the pastor. Who elect the person is God himself. Amen. Then we just lay hands. The apostolic ministry. We go on. The elders of the church lay hands upon him recognizing this man and placing and placing him. the apostolic ministry of laying hands on him that he would go and preach the gospel that they believe that the gift of God they believe what the gift of God was working in him put me pastor I want papers. Who told you these young boys all over here? They wanted to be pastors. I am also a pastor. Who who has recognized that gift? They just go to people without the experience ordain me. [Music] It's just like children playing outside. They know during the night they will go at home. God is going to judge them. One of the good days This not the playing game. That is the way they did also to the ministers by laying hands on them and giving them the right hand of fellowship. I'm going to give my brother the right hand of fellowship. Amen. I'm going to say from today on you are also my pastor. Hallelujah to work together as an agreement before God. that they seen the gift working in this brother. I believe the brothers who have come with the pastor the pastor to be they've seen the gift says he witnessed that he was that he was called for something. Make me a pastor. Troubles. Where did you get it? That is what the prophet is saying here that she was called for something. Amen. Predestinated pastor by God. Amen. And we believe it. And they lay hands on him that God will bless him. And it was a sanction. When we sing, when we sing, we shall call the brothers with the brothers to come here. Amen to be ordained. Amen. As I passed with the power invested upon me by the ordination of my father. I'm also going to do the same thing. He transferred the power of God. He recognized that power in me. He sanctioned the power. That that power must go on. Then I take it. I'm going to place it in my bra. With the powers from heaven, we are going to ordain them from today. In fact, he was the pastor from the beginning. God doesn't start. He's not like me. When I start things when you are the pastor, you were the pastor. Amen. He knew who will be ships under [Music] you. by accident. When people go away, they go away because they were not predestined to be under you. They must just go. Why are they wasting time? Why are they wasting time? Listen, listen, listen, listen. Oh my father [Music] forgiving as your [Music] son and [Music] your children your on earth and is down. We say thank you Lord. Thank you oh my [Music] father. Hallelujah. [Music] brother. [Music] Hallelujah. Your [Music] word is your spirit. [Music] Heaven me father now and here Lord as your children here are men of God elders of the church they are laying their hands on this brother here this morning in your name to sanction this brother to give this brother the right of way. We are not giving people gifts. We don't have those powers. We just recognize the gifts that we have already placed in a man. Then we just put our hands to sanction what we have already done. We believe Lord you have chosen this brother to lead your children there to feed them not with his own knowledge but with the knowledge from you because you have said through the mouth of the prophet the Holy Ghost will take the weight and bring it direct to the pastor so that the pastor can take it and feed the sheep. Believe from now on will add to what has already had. The Holy Ghost will go on doing his work in the life of our brother. I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Music] your son and your sweet [Music] We say thank you [Music] [Applause] Lord [Music] for your [Music] son and [Music] Oh, your name [Music] is Thank you. You may take your seats.

We must get excited, excitement knowing that he's coming at you. Amen. Our acceptance will bring heaven down. Our resentment will stop heaven. But if there is one who resent or two or three, I am asking God to forgive them. [Music] because the pillar of fire will strike them. But now I'm going to stand between them and God as Moses has standed in the wilderness when God was about to strike them. Moses turned the day while we stand up. I think so. Then we sing our [Music] song when he sh [Music] begin to sound. All should be finished.

If you still remember during marts the church would sing until they are tired while Martin was in his office trying to connect with God and he won't get in. If he if he's not connected, our Martin is still trying to [Music] connect. He's still taking this number one. He's trying to connect these things. It's not for the first time here. People want to bring something to the people of God. People who want to bring something, they just don't rush to the pulpit. They take their time until they feel that they must they can go there. They have got something that they can present to the children of God. You are the children of God. No one has the right to play with you. That's why when we come in front of you, we come in an e because we are coming to his wife to his wife. You don't just come. You must be sure what you have. You come from far. You didn't just come here. You are here to hear something. Some have got some problems. Some have come with sickness. But you have got the promise here. But the time will come when the word of God is preached. People who have come with diseases those diseases will just vanish while the word is preached. Now we are here with that promise. We know that the word is coming. Whatever we have, whatever question we have is going to be answered. Whatever question we have is going to be answered. Whatever problem is going to be solved, you'll never go back with your problem. God is not God of unbelievers. Is God of believers. He has predestinated the believers for this age here. This is the meeting or the gathering of the believers. It is the gathering of the ichess. God has seen that there is a problem here. That's why he sent an echel so that the eagle must announce when it is in the air there. We are the iglers. They cannot people cannot understand us and we know they never understand us because we are ickless. And our pastors, they know when they come in front of us, they're coming in front of the ichess. The ichklas want the fresh kill. They don't want the old one. We want the fresh kill. That's why they take their time to looking for the fresh king from spoken word to another spoken worden to spoken to another spoken word to another spoken word looking for the fresh key. We don't just pick one spoken rush to the pulpit. [Music] We are fortunate people to live in this wonderful age. The age above above all dispensation. above all church ages age. That's why it is called a bright age, not the church age. The church age is over. This is the bright. The churches that outside, they're complaining. They think they they all the only right people. We also have the spirit. We also heal the disease. We also make wonders. They can't reach where we are. Far above demons cannot reach. They are yawning to reach that. Give us another song.

The first time I met him, I said, "You are my son." I don't know why. Now I I know why. Amen. Amen. Now we will read the the last book and you know Revelation 8 verse one. Revelation chapter 8. Is that 8 verse one? Yes sir. Then let us hear what it says. Some other things I will tell the church later. [Music] the seventh seal. There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Amen. Can I borrow your wrist? You know the voice I I don't want everybody to hear this. Your wrist watch. Amen. Let's Oh, my brother. Pastor Masha, how are you pastor? Ah, God bless you, sir. Amen.

Heavenly Father, we come to thee again this morning. Lord, looking unto you. We know that Father, you promised us that when the trumpet shall sound, Amen. The trumpet we believe the trumpet has already sounded and what we are looking for is a flight. Amen. And father very soon we know we shall be taken away. We are waiting for that moment. Father as I pray in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. the kids or the children are she just said a great amen. Amen brother where you are. Amen. Seven seals. You know seven seals closes the new Right. Amen. Did we pray? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Now, let's read Revelation 8:1. Yeah. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Okay. Amen. You may be seated. Uh maybe it will take 15 to 30 minutes. The Lord willing. Amen. Now, all right. We'll look at this in the Bible. Six seals has been opened to us. This actually the sixth seal has been open and to us and we know that this seven seal cannot be broke to the public. until that hour arrive. So there is a six seal and the seven the seals the six seal has been open to the public. Okay. Amen. We see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. Amen. Amen. Until that hour. All right. Amen. That's why uh you meet some people who will say to you, "The seventh is not revealed. And now here it says h and we know that the seventh can be be cannot be broke to the public you know. So there there is a public. You know what public is and also again I read this part. Now here that the seven seal is opened. The seven seal is not to be opened to the public. It repeats it again. Now you know what the but the public is. What's meaning by the public? Some say the seven seal is not open. Now that's the public and some believe that it is open. That is the bride. Okay. Amen. Now I read because something some here it says the New Testament [Music] uh the seventh seal closes the New Testament. That is that is he that is in you. He that is in you. Page 24. Paragraph 24. Paragraph 24. Paragraph 24. Now it says, read it for me, brother, a bit. Paragraph 24. He that is in you. Now there it is scientifically prove that it is the truth. So therefore we don't worry about whether is truth both scientifically and spiritually. And what was said come to pass. The message of the seventh the seven seals is their clo in their closing. That's the message of the entire Bible. The seven seals closes the New Testament and seal it up. That is true. Amen. Amen. The seven seal closes close what? Newestament. meaning that uh it is closed according to the prophet. All right. Amen. Now I think you are still asking for uh this uh what the prophet says in your mind. The seven the the the sixth seal has been open to us. We see it and now that the seventh seal cannot be broken to the public. So you understand that's why the public says the the seventh seal is not revealed that is not the that is the public but to the bride the bride of Christ it is open. Amen. Amen. And uh here it says the seventh seals closes the New Testament. Okay. How? Because now we have preached the seven the the the uh the seven seals. in the New Testament and sealed it up. That is true. Amen. Amen. Not that it closed to us. It is not closed the seventh seal, but to the public it is closed. Amen. Amen. Right. Amen. And that's why uh the pyramid comes in. The prophet says you are in the pyramid. Then the Lord willing will come to that. That is another revelation. M the bride is in the pyramid. Now the question is what is a pyramid? Amen. Amen. H it is not just structure. Yeah. But it it it was in the Bible here. Enoch the seventh seventh man. It tells us that he was the man responsible for this structure, the pyramid because being the seventh he was responsible for the pyramid structure and the Lord willing will come to that. It doesn't just h speak about a a building. Before you know could start the structure to build that structure. We will read to you that the he it says the material that Enoch for the pyramid he found it there ready for to build the structure and we will come and see where it says h you will see your self self in the pyramid. [Applause] Okay. Amen. Now, uh when it comes to the pyramid, there are so many things we will look at. Right. Amen. Uh even the the six that that's why it says the six seal has been opened to us. And then the seventh seal is not today public. Oh, so we understand. Then I come to this book and just for opening the way on these things you you you don't need you don't need to be a professor. No, you need to be the seed. that was planted before there was a professor. You a seed, seed of God. Amen. Amen. And now seals 574. It's it it says, "Do did I read this?" Yes, sir. Okay. Amen. All right. This pyramid as brother Brennham says you will see your time in the pyramid. Now it doesn't mean that you should go to Egypt. No. But in the pyramid this pyramid people are looking at a natural structure. But we look at it here about what the prophet says. All right. Amen. Now here and again. I think I have I I write this please part. The seven seals closes the new testament. What does that mean? Does that mean the the New Testament the the Old Testament or closes the New? Meaning the Old Testament closes the New Or the New Testament closes the New Testament closes the Old Testament. Amen. Amen. So and and sealed it up. That is true. Now we know that by the prophet utterance by scientific and and by the word. Okay. Amen. Now I come to this part also. Uh uh now the the six uh here now we find that the six has been opened. We know that seven seals cannot be broke to the public. We have seen that. And we come where it says now uh now here that the seventh seal is not open to the public and uh you know if you if you belong to a denomination that doesn't believe this things and that is the public. The prophet calls it the public. Amen. Amen. And now and he says now hear that the seventh seal is not that this is page 574 574. uh the seventh seal is not open is not to be known to the people. Now I I I believe from today if you find somebody who says h the seventh seal is not open the prophet tells you that it is not opened to the public. Amen. So six seal has been open to us. We see it and we know that This seventh seal cannot not be broke today until that hour. But then he goes to say now hear that the seventh seal is not open is not to be open or to be known to the public. Now you have the public And you have the bride. The bride. The bride do not know what the public know. It's not revealed to them. Ah. Okay. You are still going to see some other things concerning this. Now here now that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public. You can talk and talk but it is not revealed just the public. Amen. Amen. And it won't be revealed to the public. All right. Amen. M I look at something else. Oh, God bless you, sir. Amen. All right. I think we have read this part here. Yes, sir. The seventh seal closes the New Testament. Amen. That means now the message now is the seven seals. The other one is closed. Is that so? It repeats here. Uh again now here I will take this part here maybe before we can try to preach. Let me interpret him. Yeah. on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone not no writing on it that's the reason I had to go west to connect with this angel's message now when he comes to the white rock then he speaks about the angel. Now for for to meet the angel, he had to go west. Let me look at this. That's the reason I had to go [Music] west. Actually, where was the prophet? East. East. Okay. Then he had to go west. That's the reason he had to go west to connect with these angels to come back here to real to to to reveal it to the church. Now remember I said the next thing that that will happen let me read uh the next thing the reason I had to go west to connect with this angel's message to come back here to reveal to the church. I said that the next things that will happen will be here at the church. Were you there? Amen. If you are the bride of Christ, you belong to this. The prophet says a message he he came back to reveal it. To reveal it what on the inside on the inside. You know we will look at the insiders. He spoke of the insiders. All right. Amen. Like that pyramid maybe a scholar can say no it is like this or it is that but it is a scholar. But if you come to Enoch, if you come to brother Brennham, you can check it and he's a drawing drawing of his pyramid. You see the difference is that there's the out outside part of the pyramid, but he speaks of the inside. of the pyramid pyramid. So what you need is to go in then you'll see what he's talking about. Okay. Amen. Now here it says again the third came. He just says the third king came from the west and then sweeping. So and he comes to Jackson's and on the inside of that pyramid there was a white stone. On the inside. Amen. Yes. Now there was a a white stone. wasn't written on. It's just a white stone. That's the reason I had to go to connect with the angels message. I had to go west to connect w with this angel. Now, why? Now, I'm not looking for an angel. I'm looking for the message. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. That's why the first time I received the message there and I was told about the prophet, I didn't go around looking for the prophet. Amen. But I said to them, uh, please give me the books. because I I didn't I was not looking for the prophet. I was looking for the message. So because he preached the message, that's what I was looking for because the the the message is the inner h revelation. The the revelation was in the prophet just spoke revealed that message in him. So I was not looking for the uh the prophet prophet I was looking for the message for the message. All right. Amen. Even now here we know of the inner part of the pyramid. If they show me a pyramid, I will say please let me get inside. I want the inside of the pyramid. Amen. Not the structure now. And these seven seals closed New Testament. The New Testament. Oh, again. Amen. Now, yeah. He comes again. Now, the the the third he saw this flying. M what was flying flying interpretation? Oh hey yeah flying one. Have you ever seen flying fly flying interpretation? Okay. Amen. No it's so quiet for the flying. Amen. Now because seven seals closes the newest what says see okay yeah I'll come back to that now here we come uh this six sixth seal has been open to us and we know that this seventh seal, the seventh seal cannot be opened to the public. Until that hour. All right. Amen. Then it goes down. Now, yeah, until that hour, God has finished dealing with the [Music] inner, the inner part of the church. Now I come here now here that the seven seal is not to the public. not known to the public. You can go round and rounding about the ser you will be told to told that it is not revealed to the public. Then uh they'll preach to you the sixth but not the seventh. All right. Amen. Now, if you want to see the ministry or the revelation, you must look for the seventh because the six don't have it all. But if you want a a complete revelation of God, you go to the seven. Is that right? Now it says the sixth seal to it has been opened to us. We see it. This seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. Okay. Amen. I I think you are satisfied because you know now the seventh is to the bride. That's why now the six cannot preach to the seven but the seven preached to the preaches to the six. Amen. Amen. Now if you know these things, you know this the public and what the bride. All right. Amen. Now you are sitting here as the bride. the bride or amen. All right. Amen. Now, if you are the bride, now this is what I'm reading here about is your inner part. Hallelujah. If you are the the bride. But if you are not the bride, you are receiving nothing because the six part is closed. That's right. Now a Christian now who is it will tell you that we are in the pyramid. Amen. Amen. We we don't just talk about the py pyramid. It says we are in the pyramid. That is the end. Now if you find somebody who is not in the pyramid he is he he can come up to six. That's that's that's all. Okay. Amen. Now, uh we find out the six the the six seal to us. We have seen it. Then the seventh seal is not to the public. All right. Amen. Now uh if I we open the revelation here you will realize that it's only for those with the seventh h you you count to this people you come to six you'll be you'll receive amen. Amen. you go further, you come to seven. No. Amen. Amen. Amen. So, uh the six to us it has been we know it and know that the seventh is not to the public. So meeting the six uh you will start a battle you know the six when they meet it's a battle they they don't meet for the revelation. They meet for a battle. Okay. Amen. Uh we find out that the six to us it has been open but the seven cannot be open to the [Music] public. All right. Amen. How they hear that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public. Yes. And [Music] then seven when it meets seven now it's a conference conference. when they meet with a conference, but when seven meet six, it's a battle. [Applause] All right. Amen. Now uh now uh now we find that the six seal has been opened to us that mean to the seven seal. When the six meets the seven there's always a conflict. conflict because the seven cannot hear what the seven says is. Amen. But you find let let me read this now. The six se has been open to us. We see it not only opened but we see it otherwise if we don't see it will cause a battle between two. But it says we see it. And do you see it, brother? Amen. Amen. Do you see the seven? Yes, sir. Amen. All right. Amen. All right. The seven seals closes the New Testament. Okay. Amen. The seventh seal closes the seven. Now if to them it is closed that means when when the seven speaks the six don't hear anything. That's why you see pieces of churches you ask are you in the message? Yes. Thank you brother. Thanks for the service. Should you go further and say seven? They said no. No, no, no. You see, Amen. I will finish just now. And now that's why it says seven seals. Seven seals close. Let's look at these things. The seven seal closes the new testament and seal it. Now we know that by prophetic utterance and three give the witness to it. Now listen this carefully the message of the seven seals in their closing. That's the message of the entire Bible. Amen. So now the people that are in the seven uh they preach a complete message they are in the seven in the seven. So here it says the seven seals closes the new testament. All right. Amen. Seven. The whole thing is wrapped in seven. The message now the the predestinated people they are in the seven. Okay. Amen. And then uh that one seven sins the new testament. Testament s closes the new testament. It doesn't say mean you tear out the old testament. The new testament the old testament. It says h sevens closes the new testament. Amen. Now, if you buy a Bible and you find that it doesn't contain the New Testament or or the Old Testament, what are you going to do? Because we don't have half Bible. No, just one Bible. But if you don't believe the the the the prophet comes and to give light to both the old and the new and it shows you that this one closes this one. All right. Amen. Now if this one is closed now, now you are going to dwell in the in the open one. In the open one because in the open one you will receive the message of the seven sins. So there's one is opened, one is closed. Now you must make sure that you you you enter into the open one of them. All right. Amen. Because the new tell you about the old. No, but you end up if you read the old and then it will give you the interpretation of the new. Otherwise, uh you'll be walking on the other side of the Bible. All right. Amen. I come here. The seven seals the closes the new testament. That means it it it gives you complete revelation of the new and seal it up. Now we know that by prophetic by scientific we know that uh that is by prophetic utterance by scientific and by the word and then h that three give the witness to it. Okay. Amen. I think we have passed. Uh on the inside of the pyramid there was white that is page 575 of the seals on the inside of the pyramid. You know pyramid is not something that you just walk around and say hey this windows are nice. You go inside will come and enter the inside of the pyramid. The seven seal not known to the public. On the inside of the pyramid, there was a white stone wasn't written on. That's the reason I had to go west to connect with the angel's message to back. You know, there was a connection of the angels, the angels. And it says here Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret for him. Amen. Amen. On the inside of that pyramid, there was a white stone that wasn't written on it. That's the reason I had to go west. to connect with these angels. Amen. Amen. That's the reason. Yeah. I had to go west to connect with this angel's message to come back here. That's the reason we come to the place. We have come to the place after the the seventh angel messenger has returned from the east west from west from the west. Amen. Amen. Because at the end he will tell you that east and west has met. So it says, "Junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret on the inside of that pyramid. There was white stone that wasn't written on. That's the reason I had to go west to connect with the angel's message. I had to go west to connect with this angel's message to come back here to reveal it to the church. Are you listening? So meaning that without uh the pro the seventh angel messenger you will remain without the inner I read it because you should be found in the pyramid. Amen. Amen. uh that that the seal has been open to us right now. Here it says that they will come to this mi mystery of the of the three of them three. Sorry, hold on a bit. The the um will know right around about that far the rest of it because he was talking of the of the time of the mystery of to be known. Therefore, we are this far. There was a mystery to be known now as Christians uh lives brother. Yeah, I think he's right. Uh Christian lives looking for his coming. You see what I'm looking at? Yes. Amen. Yeah. Let's just all pray straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming. Amen. All right. Amen. Now what we are looking now for is for his coming [Music] All right. Amen. But we must receive the message that will bring him here. The message for his coming. He he has sent us this message of his coming. So we should know the message of his coming. Amen. Amen. And then so you read on, pardon me a bit. Amen. Is it's not Satan. It's just Amen. Okay. I will [Music] read. Now let's just all pray. live good, straight and looking forward to his coming. Amen. You know for his coming we we have been on a journey to come to the spot where we can look for his. All right. Amen. Uh on the inside of that pyramid, there was white stone that wasn't written in. That's the reason I had to go west to connect with this angel's message to come back to reveal it to the church. He went to to connect with the angels with him. Come back now to connect with us. The bride. All right. So he connected to us the message of the seven angels. Amen. And that's the reason I had to go west. to connect with these angels and reason I had oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to connect to come back here to reveal it to the church now the next things that the next thing to happen is to come back here I repeat amen Amen. To reveal it to the church. So now the insight of the mystery in the pyramid revealed to the church. And let me say the people who are not part of the bride, they don't know about it. is just to worship and to say the the the prophet said this the prophet said this but they don't understand they still need somebody to interpret what the prophet has said. Amen. Amen. Now because there's the outward part and inside part of it. Now the person who has never entered the pyramid, he will wait for somebody who will come with the message in the pyramid. Now the message that we are preaching is from within. Amen. Amen. Amen. And then uh that's why it says on the inside let me see my part again now. Amen. The reason I go to west to connect with this angel's message. Now the message that you have received is from the inside of the pyramid pyramid. Now and outsiders they do not know what the insiders has received. So preaching the same thing, you find this one h inside the pyramid coming from the inside. He will preach you to you the inside [Music] mystery. Then you find another one who has never received the ministry from the inside. So that's the difference. That's why we do not agree in some things because a part is from the inside and the other part is outside. It's from the outside. Amen. H from the outside. You can say we thank God we have received the prophet but that just the outside part and you come and tell the same person about the mysteries of God brought to us by the prophet. He will say the the seventh the seventh seal is not he's [Music] also calling himself the message um believer believer. Amen. Amen. Amen. But he's got only the outside part. Once the the prophet enters the pyramid, these other believers don't know have have you have they have not received the mystery from the inside of the pyramid of the pyramid. Now you see you see these two two one is an outsider according to the prophet. Thank you. Amen. Uh they are all believers but you have the outsiders and insiders. That one also believed that God has sent the prophet but yet an outsider and the other one is an insider. Okay. Amen. Now before I finish this part here, now hear that this seven seal is not to be known to the public speaking about an outsider. All right. Amen. here. Now the seven seal cannot be broke broke to the public. Are you the public? All day you must find be found inside the real the message now inside. So you have the insiders and the outsiders. Amen. In this message that's why you you you somebody comes and uh he ask about the seven. All right. Amen. And then after that the answer is open. He goes to the inner member of the pyramid. He says it is opened. Amen. They uh they are they both uh believe the message. Believe the message. But one says the seventh is not revealed. The other one says it is revealed. But both they come to church and but yet one is an outsider and another one is an inside. Okay. Amen. Now uh let me stop here and we'll come back. I don't know we'll meet when again. I don't know when. Amen. Okay. Amen. I I'm I'm trying to pick up the last part here now. That that that the seventh is not to be known to the public. The public They oppose on things. Amen. Because the insiders uh they come with the in inside message. Inside message. Now you now you see now as I I'm closing. The outsiders don't know anything about the insiders. They they are also the believers but of the outside but the insiders they come from the innermost to to preach the innermost message. So it's different. Now on the inside of the pyramid there was white stone. That's the reason I had to go west. Uh the reason I had to go west was to connect with the angel's message. Now you see the message that we follow is from the inside. Is that right? Amen. Okay. Now in closing, we shall stand up to after reading this uh the constellation in the form of a pyramid in the con constellation constellation in the form of the pyramid. Therefore, it was in the pyramid where it it where the come brother mysterious mysterious was not written on. Okay. Now we shall come again uh to look at the this mysterious white rock white rock. The people are trying to find the message of the white rock. Now let us hope leave it now and uh Amen. And but to be continued. Amen. God bless you. To be continued. Amen. Amen. As we stand up, it's a young one. Shall we stand up and ask the men of God here just to say a word a prayer for us as we are leaving to come back. Amen. To continue in the name of the Lord. God bless you for now. Amen. Amen. Okay. We shall come back to see and to see that we are in the pyramid. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And we are the king's messengers. King's messengers. All right. Amen. Inside. Okay. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. And we shall meet again. Shall offer a prayer for us. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let us bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father.
