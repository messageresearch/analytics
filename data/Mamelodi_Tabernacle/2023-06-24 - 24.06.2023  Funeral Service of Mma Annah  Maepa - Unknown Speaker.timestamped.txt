[1:16:21] ah are you there brother
[1:16:24] okay
[1:16:26] and
[1:16:29] First Corinthians
[1:16:33] chapter 15 and chapter verse 22.
[1:16:39] 22
[1:16:51] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 22.
[1:16:55] for us in Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:17:00] shall all be made alive
[1:17:04] okay thank you amen
[1:17:06] amen you may be seated
[1:17:10] okay
[1:17:31] or
[1:17:36] um
[1:17:42] God bless them with children and Grand
[1:17:46] children
[1:17:49] may they be comforted
[1:17:53] according to the word of God
[1:17:57] and they're here
[1:17:59] we find in the scriptures foreign
[1:18:09] foreign
[1:18:21] so we only know of death
[1:18:24] and the life
[1:18:29] and
[1:18:34] yeah that's the natural
[1:18:36] and the spiritual Lea small
[1:18:41] okay
[1:18:44] forgive us for
[1:18:54] the world I mean
[1:18:55] okay
[1:18:58] and all the relatives
[1:19:07] sons and daughters
[1:19:10] and we are so glad
[1:19:14] and some of them are here
[1:19:18] as Christians and
[1:19:23] you know about Christianity
[1:19:26] that's why the decision is made why
[1:19:29] while one is alive and
[1:19:36] you should know where you are going
[1:19:39] then you will know where you are coming
[1:19:43] that's why he says Adam
[1:19:49] foreign
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:17] was here in the form of men are
[1:20:20] alligator he looks so much like us
[1:20:25] until even today
[1:20:27] some we don't accept him as God
[1:20:33] because this word was made flesh
[1:20:38] and dwelt among us
[1:20:41] and so it looks so much
[1:20:48] today we don't know who Christ is
[1:20:54] but if you are not if you are born again
[1:21:07] and then you have another birth
[1:21:11] which is spiritual healing yeah
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:34] who died
[1:21:37] I was just reading this part
[1:21:40] where it says
[1:21:42] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:46] you know it's not just it's not that the
[1:21:49] human blood
[1:21:52] he's black the Bible says it's the blood
[1:21:56] of God
[1:21:58] and we understand that
[1:22:02] is
[1:22:04] saved us from sin
[1:22:35] and when we were Sinners
[1:22:39] and he took our form we our
[1:22:43] chairman died for us
[1:22:47] to redeem us
[1:22:50] you know
[1:22:52] you all know
[1:22:53] Redemption to take something back to his
[1:22:57] original
[1:22:59] contribution
[1:23:02] amen so what we used to be really sauna
[1:23:07] the Adams
[1:23:22] it is like we always repeat the same
[1:23:26] thing
[1:23:28] uh
[1:23:49] the other one that was also born
[1:23:53] there was some predictions
[1:24:00] and now you can compare
[1:24:13] my mother passed away when she was 90.
[1:24:18] just there
[1:24:24] I mean I thank God because she was a
[1:24:28] Christian
[1:24:31] uh she believed in God
[1:24:34] who has created
[1:24:39] amen right now for few minutes
[1:24:44] for us in Adam
[1:24:48] or die
[1:24:51] to die is to separate who will be
[1:24:54] separated or to separate you die that's
[1:25:00] what the River Jordan meant
[1:25:04] uh
[1:25:29] even what what they do
[1:25:33] I want you to ensure it before you drive
[1:25:36] it out
[1:25:41] you can crush the very same moment
[1:25:45] after leaving the garage
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:02] so in Christ
[1:26:04] shall all be made alive
[1:26:10] they shall not crash
[1:26:14] in you go Europe
[1:26:17] a very same scripture here
[1:26:21] verse 44. it says of our body
[1:26:27] is shown in it is shown a natural body
[1:26:32] it is raised a spiritual body
[1:26:36] there is a natural body
[1:26:40] and there is a spiritual voice
[1:26:43] amen amen we have this one goes into
[1:26:47] hospital and so forth

[1:27:11] we stop taking things
[1:27:14] when we shall have changed
[1:27:20] into an eternal body
[1:27:23] you know because this body is not
[1:27:27] eternity
[1:27:29] be a king
[1:27:36] that's why we have history
[1:27:40] but in heaven there's no history
[1:27:52] she knew about it
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:25] it can keep me forever
[1:28:30] that body of yours cannot keep you
[1:28:33] forever
[1:28:34] foreign
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:34] is
[1:30:00] uh there's a brother here
[1:30:08] we went to this Undertaker amen
[1:30:15] yes I'm in a box yeah I'm in a box
[1:30:19] and then they saw you know but this one
[1:30:22] is bleeding yeah
[1:30:28] but it's a box

[1:30:35] do this
[1:30:37] amen
[1:31:20] he came to my house
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:45] there will be a soon
[1:31:53] and died
[1:31:56] but he was saying that joking
[1:32:03] well today you are saying it because you
[1:32:07] are still working and talking
[1:32:10] everything
[1:32:11] but there is one day
[1:32:15] that is going to be
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:34] you know today they are in the sixth
[1:32:37] Dimensions
[1:32:42] only they won't come back here
[1:33:01] they are waiting for US foreign
[1:33:13] you can look at the events
[1:33:17] you can see that there's no more time
[1:33:21] the world is is drifting towards the
[1:33:24] tribulation
[1:33:27] those who understand
[1:33:30] look at the things today
[1:33:34] the mind of a young man
[1:33:38] and uh
[1:33:40] you know
[1:33:43] young women the other one they call you
[1:33:47] know here no in in Adam
[1:33:51] all died
[1:33:54] all right amen now death look who is
[1:33:57] separation because
[1:34:04] they are dead even though they are alive
[1:34:09] a person who is who is dead
[1:34:14] who does not even know that God
[1:34:17] opposite
[1:34:45] uh
[1:34:49] or satanism
[1:34:53] uh and you wonder today how can a man
[1:34:57] choose Satan who instead of the Lord
[1:35:01] Jesus Christ
[1:35:04] but God has the answer to all this
[1:35:08] which comes by predestination
[1:35:11] you were predestinated before the
[1:35:15] foundation of the world
[1:35:17] God knew all about you
[1:35:21] will be here this morning
[1:35:33] and then the person who has received the
[1:35:38] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:46] who is against
[1:35:49] Christianity he was also predestinated
[1:35:52] foreign
[1:37:13] by the blood of God
[1:37:16] you know I was just reading that
[1:37:19] the blood
[1:37:24] the word
[1:37:26] that we have received is that blood
[1:37:31] because
[1:37:33] when
[1:37:35] uh
[1:37:37] when God shows through
[1:37:45] he should come through a woman
[1:37:49] the angel came and then now this Angel
[1:37:53] who has this Angel hey Gabriel Gabriel
[1:37:58] the angel came to Mary
[1:38:04] your favorites
[1:38:10] then what happened
[1:38:13] uh this Angel spoke to me
[1:38:17] and finally Mary because she was a
[1:38:22] virgin
[1:38:23] she didn't understand the angels
[1:38:32] He said how come because I have no man
[1:38:35] amen amen and then he saw Charlie
[1:38:37] because that what what the angel was
[1:38:41] talking about
[1:38:42] was not human seeds
[1:38:46] the seed of God
[1:38:48] now the seed of God was that way

[1:39:47] way
[1:39:48] amen amen the power is in the way amen
[1:39:52] so
