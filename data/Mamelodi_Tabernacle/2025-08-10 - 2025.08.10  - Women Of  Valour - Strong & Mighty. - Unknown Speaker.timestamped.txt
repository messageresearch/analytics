[1:07:00] I remember one day, gracious Lord, the
[1:07:03] prophet was called
[1:07:06] to a certain lady or sister who was sick
[1:07:10] of appendix.
[1:07:13] When he arrived there, he has to teach
[1:07:15] the sister to have faith.
[1:07:19] She said to her, "Do you have faith?"
[1:07:22] And she said, "Yes, but the prophet
[1:07:24] could see that the lady does in the
[1:07:27] sister doesn't have a faith.
[1:07:30] She also told her that if you've got
[1:07:32] faith, you can say to that bracelet on
[1:07:34] the wall
[1:07:38] to move.
[1:07:40] But the lady, the sister, she couldn't.
[1:07:43] Gracious Lord, until the prophet has to
[1:07:47] speak to the family to move backwards so
[1:07:51] that she can speak to the sister
[1:07:54] and she taught her faith, Lord.
[1:07:57] And when the prophet prayed
[1:08:01] and the sister felt the appendix that
[1:08:04] there was a move
[1:08:06] and the prophet said now you are healed
[1:08:08] because your faith has healed you
[1:08:13] this morning. Gracious Lord we pray that
[1:08:16] all the request that has been brought
[1:08:19] father

[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father God, for your

[1:34:15] Our deacon and my brother Tamaka are
[1:34:19] standing before the church this morning.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; These men are going to be the mouthpiece
[1:34:24] of the most high God.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; we pray that the anointing of the locus
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; will cover them, Lord God Almighty.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray that the anointing of the
[1:34:36] locus will anoint the body this morning
[1:34:40] so that heavenly father your presence
[1:34:43] will be manifested once again. Thank you
[1:34:46] father. We give you praise and honor in
[1:34:48] the glorious name of our lord and savior
[1:34:50] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Open our bible.
[1:35:04] In the book of Genesis chapter 16
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; in the book of Genesis chapter 16
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; from verse one to four.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Genesis 16 from verse one.
[1:35:20] Now Sarai Abraham's wife bare him no
[1:35:23] children and she had an husband an
[1:35:26] handmade an Egyptian whose name was
[1:35:29] Haga. And Sar Sarai said unto Abraham,
[1:35:34] Behold now the Lord hath restrained me
[1:35:37] from bearing.
[1:35:39] I pray thee, go in unto my mate. It may
[1:35:44] be that I may obtain children by her.
[1:35:47] And Abraham heckened to the voice of
[1:35:50] Sarai. And Sarai, Abraham's wife, took
[1:35:53] Haga, her maid, the Egyptian,
[1:35:57] after Abraham had dwelt.
[1:36:00] 10 years in the land of Canaan, and gave
[1:36:03] her to her husband Abraham to be his
[1:36:07] wife. And he went in unto Haga, and she
[1:36:11] conceived. And when she saw that she had
[1:36:15] conceived, her mistress was despised in
[1:36:18] her eyes.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] Uh we may be seated.
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:30] Just a greeting from the pastor once
[1:36:33] more.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He is more than fine.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] I took a long walk with him on Friday
[1:36:52] on the banks of the river.
[1:36:56] So, we're just sharing.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to let you know
[1:37:02] that all is well.
[1:37:04] We want to thank God for your prayers.
[1:37:09] Amen. Amen. And uh
[1:37:12] happy
[1:37:14] women's day to our sisters.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] [Applause]
[1:37:23] So the previous messages we preached,
[1:37:30] we were focusing on the simultaneous
[1:37:33] occurrences.
[1:37:37] Then we were talking about the
[1:37:39] millennium.
[1:37:41] I wanted to continue with the message
[1:37:43] this morning.
[1:37:45] But I think I said to you previously
[1:37:50] that when you are on a journey,
[1:37:52] you sometimes stop for refreshment
[1:37:57] and come back to the journey again.
[1:38:00] So when I was still continue with the
[1:38:04] same message
[1:38:07] then I decided
[1:38:09] God gave me the guidance
[1:38:12] to take a refreshment
[1:38:15] because it's the month of the women.
[1:38:20] I said let me just comfort them
[1:38:24] and give them more strength
[1:38:26] and talk about the message that is
[1:38:29] pertainth unto them.
[1:38:32] So this morning we will talk about women
[1:38:36] of valor.
[1:38:39] Amen. The strong and mighty women of
[1:38:42] God.
[1:38:44] That is the message for this morning as
[1:38:47] we are in the journey.
[1:38:50] Be not discouraged.
[1:38:52] We are in a journey. We will get there.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; As I was asking our brother to pray for
[1:39:02] us,
[1:39:04] I was just thinking about him
[1:39:07] the previous night and how we went to
[1:39:12] and baptized many people.
[1:39:14] You see, it's not big in structure.
[1:39:19] But when he baptized
[1:39:22] is like
[1:39:24] they are too light in his hands
[1:39:27] all the people we baptiz in
[1:39:31] for from our brother here. So I always
[1:39:34] honor him. Amen.
[1:39:37] And I want to tell you that the the
[1:39:41] message
[1:39:43] will is going all over
[1:39:46] after service when when you are
[1:39:49] sleeping.
[1:39:50] He took this message.
[1:39:53] He took this he take this message and
[1:39:56] write it. He will write and send the
[1:39:59] children of God in.
[1:40:02] So h when I think about my brother,
[1:40:06] I can't hold myself.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[1:40:12] we need to appreciate one another.
[1:40:17] We need one another.
[1:40:19] If you are a loner,
[1:40:22] you won't make it in life.
[1:40:25] One day, you will need us.
[1:40:29] Don't try to make yourself something.
[1:40:33] just be a son and a daughter of David.
[1:40:38] Brother Brenham was a prophet,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; but he will say to the church,
[1:40:44] pray for me as I pray for you. Let's
[1:40:48] pray for one another.
[1:40:50] Amen. Amen. That is why this message is
[1:40:54] about the women
[1:40:56] in the Bible that stood the test of time
[1:41:02] about the women this morning that are
[1:41:06] standing for the word of God.
[1:41:09] Be not discouraged.
[1:41:11] Amen. Amen. where we just read now
[1:41:16] we found Sar
[1:41:18] being the wife to Abraham
[1:41:22] and the Bible here saying
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; they didn't have children.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And then Sarah said to Abraham,
[1:41:32] you can take Hag
[1:41:34] to have kids for us.
[1:41:39] But remember, God said to Abraham,
[1:41:42] "You shall have a son." But they wanted
[1:41:46] to do it their own way,
[1:41:49] Sarah took it upon herself.
[1:41:53] And she said to Abraham,
[1:41:55] "Get hag and have kids." Amen. Amen. So
[1:42:01] Abraham
[1:42:02] accepted the offer
[1:42:05] they took and they have a son by the
[1:42:09] name of Ishmael.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; So you know in life if someone can
[1:42:17] realize that he has something that
[1:42:20] others do not have they start to be
[1:42:23] pompous
[1:42:26] because her was respecting Sara.
[1:42:30] all along. But the day she realized she
[1:42:35] has what Sah doesn't have,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; she started to disrespect.
[1:42:45] It's true.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; I can make you something today,
[1:42:49] but you will despise me tomorrow.
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Until when we meet in the mall
[1:42:58] somewhere,
[1:43:00] You won't even recognize some brother
[1:43:02] now.
[1:43:04] You will just say you look familiar.
[1:43:09] It seems like we met somewhere.
[1:43:13] That's when you realize you don't need
[1:43:17] me anymore.
[1:43:19] I'm no longer in your mind. I start to
[1:43:22] look familiar.
[1:43:24] So h
[1:43:27] make the same mistake. After she
[1:43:30] conceived,
[1:43:32] she was no longer
[1:43:34] walking humbly.
[1:43:38] She know she started to walk
[1:43:40] like this
[1:43:45] having some talks like,
[1:43:48] "Hey, this stomach,
[1:43:50] hey, this pain." Deliberate deliberately
[1:43:54] went before Sarah
[1:43:57] to show her
[1:43:59] The sun is coming.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; You are nothing.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; People are just people.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Then Sarah
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; was not happy.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that this will happen.
[1:44:17] Then she started, you know, to talk to
[1:44:20] Abraham.
[1:44:22] I I don't like the way
[1:44:25] Hag is walking
[1:44:27] before me. I don't like the way she
[1:44:31] talks to me. Then Abraham innocently
[1:44:35] will say, "No, no problem. But there is
[1:44:39] a problem."
[1:44:42] Amen. Then even if there's no birth pain
[1:44:47] when when hag see
[1:44:50] you just say it seems like the birth
[1:44:52] pains are coming.
[1:44:57] Yeah, she was doing that until one day
[1:45:01] when Abraham was was sleeping.
[1:45:05] Sarah did not sleep
[1:45:07] was just looking at Abraham.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Midnight when Abraham opened the eyes.
[1:45:14] She saw Sarah looking at
[1:45:18] she was like, "What are you trying to
[1:45:20] do?"
[1:45:22] Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Then Sarah will just say, "No, I like
[1:45:24] your beard.
[1:45:29] about the beard.
[1:45:31] Something is happening.
[1:45:34] Sarah is not happy about
[1:45:39] Abraham will just sleep and say, "Oh,
[1:45:41] she love my
[1:45:45] is deeper than you thought."
[1:45:49] Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; So she bear a child.
[1:45:55] After the child was there,
[1:45:58] the child was just like his mom.
[1:46:04] Okay?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:46:07] children can take after
[1:46:10] the other one takes after the other one,
[1:46:14] the other takes. But the child was just
[1:46:16] like his
[1:46:19] disrespectful.
[1:46:22] Then Sarah said, "Come what may,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; I won't take it anymore."
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; We can read
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; chapter 20.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Chapter 20
[1:46:42] verse 9 to 14. You can read it for us.
[1:46:52] Then Abel called Abraham.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; No, no. Is it verse 9?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Kenya chapter 20.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Verse 9.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, verse chapter 21.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Chapter 21.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; 21 verse 9. I'm sorry.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 9.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; 14.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And Sarah saw the son of Haga the
[1:47:13] Egyptian which he had born unto Abraham.
[1:47:16] Moi.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; wherefore she said unto Abraham, "Cast
[1:47:21] out his bond woman and her son,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; for the son of this bond woman shall not
[1:47:28] bear her with my son, even with Isaac."
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; And the thing was very grievious in
[1:47:34] Abraham's sight because of his son.
[1:47:37] And God said unto Abraham, "Let it not
[1:47:39] be grievious in thy sight, because of
[1:47:42] the lead, and because of thy bond woman,
[1:47:46] in all that Sarah hath said unto thee,
[1:47:49] he haken unto her voice. For in Isaac
[1:47:52] shall thy seed be called, and also of
[1:47:55] the son of the bond woman will I make a
[1:47:58] nation, because he is thy seed." And
[1:48:01] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[1:48:04] took bread and a bottle of water and
[1:48:07] gave it unto Haga, putting it on her
[1:48:09] shoulder and the child and sent her
[1:48:12] away. And she departed and wandered in
[1:48:16] the wilderness of Basha.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; The son of Hag
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; being Ishmael
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; started at home. You know,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; the child of a snake comes with a poison
[1:48:32] already.
[1:48:34] He just followed the footstep of his mom
[1:48:38] who started mocking
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Isaac and Sarah. Then after that, Sarah
[1:48:46] saw it. She was very much observant
[1:48:50] because she realized things are no
[1:48:53] longer the same anymore.
[1:48:55] Then she said to Abraham, Abraham.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Now Abraham,
[1:49:00] this woman and her son must leave.
[1:49:04] And the Bible says it was not easy
[1:49:09] to swallow because
[1:49:12] Ishmael was the son of Abraham.
[1:49:16] And Isaac was the son of Sarah
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and Abraham as well. But now it becomes
[1:49:24] two families
[1:49:26] in one house. Sarah said, "I cannot stay
[1:49:30] with them. Get rid of them. You do it.
[1:49:34] If you don't do it, I will do it."
[1:49:38] The woman that stood the test of time
[1:49:44] stand for what she believed in said to
[1:49:47] her husband, "They must leave."
[1:49:50] You know, Abraham was standing there.
[1:49:53] Maybe he went to the field and come
[1:49:56] back, go to the sheep and come back
[1:50:00] trying to talk to God,
[1:50:02] hitting himself very hard. But Sarah was
[1:50:05] just looking at him. Do whatever you
[1:50:07] want. But this one must go.
[1:50:12] Hey, the women are powerful.
[1:50:14] Don't undermine them. They can make you
[1:50:17] great and they make they can make you
[1:50:20] nothing. You cannot make a mistake. We
[1:50:23] are who we are because of our women.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; So is the women's month is amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; So now Sarah said to Abraham they will
[1:50:36] leave irrespective of any condition
[1:50:41] of your explanation they are not going
[1:50:43] to stay with us.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And when Abraham was crying there,
[1:50:52] givers and so forth,
[1:50:54] God descended
[1:50:56] and said to him, Abraham, listen to your
[1:51:00] wife.
[1:51:04] There are many men
[1:51:06] who
[1:51:09] can't be controlled by a woman. Hey,
[1:51:10] they are single today.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Because Abraham
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; stood there am
[1:51:27] I
[1:51:31] then God said
[1:51:33] listen to your
[1:51:38] let them go.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham,
[1:51:43] he said, if God said it, I don't have a
[1:51:47] leg to stand on.
[1:51:49] I must just make a plan. They must go
[1:51:53] for the sake of peace in the house. And
[1:51:56] they went. He gave them water,
[1:51:59] everything, and they go. When they were
[1:52:02] going, Abra, God said to Abraham, "There
[1:52:06] will be a nation from that boy." meaning
[1:52:11] don't worry they can go in the
[1:52:14] wilderness but the angel of God will
[1:52:17] protect them.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; We need women today
[1:52:28] that stand for what they believe.
[1:52:32] Let me read what the brother Brennham
[1:52:34] says. Question answers. They were asking
[1:52:37] him question.
[1:52:39] She said the Ishmael children,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; the Ishmael children are the sons of
[1:52:46] Abraham
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; out of heart. They believe in true
[1:52:51] Jehovah God.
[1:52:54] But the only thing that they miss is
[1:52:58] when they say Jesus is just one of the
[1:53:01] prophet.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they are through and comedants
[1:53:15] and the at the grave of Muhammad.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; You should go look
[1:53:21] striking
[1:53:24] the the great tomb there and for
[1:53:26] thousand years there's been a white
[1:53:29] horse settled
[1:53:32] standing there. Muhammad promised that
[1:53:35] he will rise
[1:53:37] from the dead
[1:53:39] someday and he will jump on that horse
[1:53:43] and conquer the the world.
[1:53:46] And every moment they just change one
[1:53:48] horse from another
[1:53:51] waiting there with faithful God
[1:53:56] standing waiting for the Muhammad to
[1:53:58] rush from there
[1:54:01] 2,000 years
[1:54:03] since then.
[1:54:05] Amen. Amen. They they believe that and
[1:54:09] it's not working for them. That was the
[1:54:11] lineage of
[1:54:14] Ishmael.
[1:54:16] That was the lineage of Ishmael
[1:54:19] believe in the true God. But they didn't
[1:54:22] have the original promise.
[1:54:25] The original promise was through the
[1:54:28] lineage of Esau.
[1:54:32] That's why through the lineage of Isaac,
[1:54:36] we see the Lord Jesus Christ who died
[1:54:40] put in the tomb on the third day he
[1:54:44] rise.
[1:54:46] This one for thousand years, he couldn't
[1:54:49] rise. It shows who has the promise. The
[1:54:54] original promise from God was the
[1:54:57] lineage of Isaac.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Who stood for that? A woman by the name
[1:55:05] of Sarah.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; He said to Abraham, "How can two walk
[1:55:13] together
[1:55:15] both agree?
[1:55:17] I do not agree with her. Ishmael will
[1:55:20] not agree with Israel. So we must go
[1:55:23] separate way. When we go separate way,
[1:55:26] we will see their fruits. They shall
[1:55:29] see.
[1:55:30] And we see the fruits of the decision of
[1:55:33] Sarah today.
[1:55:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; So as I always say, just wait upon the
[1:55:44] Lord.
[1:55:46] Our God has done a complete job.
[1:55:49] Because one day he visited Rebecca. You
[1:55:53] know when the angel of God comes always
[1:55:57] to a mama because the mama is the one
[1:56:01] that told the kids to see the child for
[1:56:06] the first time and the prophecy will be
[1:56:09] from the mom the kids. That is why
[1:56:13] Rebecca had twins Jacob and Isel. But
[1:56:18] the angel of God said to Rebecca, "You
[1:56:21] will have twins, but there is two
[1:56:23] nations in your womb." And the angel of
[1:56:27] God said to Rebecca,
[1:56:30] "I love Jacob
[1:56:32] and hate Esau."
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Before they were even born, that is why
[1:56:39] when they were born,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:44] Rebecca was protecting Jacob
[1:56:49] because he had a secret that Isaac
[1:56:52] doesn't have. And the Bible says Isaac
[1:56:57] loved Esau
[1:56:59] because Esau was a gentle man. He was a
[1:57:03] hand.
[1:57:05] He He was a good man through the eyes of
[1:57:09] the world.
[1:57:10] But Rebecca the mama had a secret that
[1:57:15] the one that will inherit is the second
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:25] I read Israel and the church
[1:57:29] God raised up Pharaoh
[1:57:32] and hardened his heart
[1:57:35] for a purpose.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; If your heart is hardened this morning,
[1:57:41] It was hardened by God by the purpose.
[1:57:45] You have a certain purpose you need to
[1:57:48] fulfill and that purpose need a hard
[1:57:51] heart.
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] God raised up Judas's scariot.
[1:57:59] He was born. He had a son of Petition.
[1:58:03] Is that right?
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Judas wanted to go to heaven. He was a
[1:58:09] good treasurer.
[1:58:10] He He was a good man. But he was a son
[1:58:14] of people. His destination
[1:58:17] was in hell.
[1:58:19] God did that.
[1:58:23] You are not here this morning because
[1:58:26] you understand message.
[1:58:29] You are here this morning because God
[1:58:32] loves you. Reveal the message to your
[1:58:36] heart.
[1:58:39] Don't be pompous and think you know bad
[1:58:43] you don't know. Let the one that know
[1:58:46] rule your heart.
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; God taught Esau
[1:58:52] and Jacob before they was ever born
[1:58:56] told his mother all about what's going
[1:58:59] to take place.
[1:59:01] One he hated
[1:59:03] the other one he had loved. Is that
[1:59:07] true? So God who does all things in all
[1:59:10] things
[1:59:12] and you have nothing to do with it,
[1:59:16] you have nothing to do.
[1:59:19] Amen.
[1:59:21] And if God has called you,
[1:59:25] the love of God is ringing in your
[1:59:28] heart,
[1:59:30] brothers and sisters, is God who does
[1:59:33] that, not you.
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:40] and all that he has called
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; will come to you and none
[1:59:47] of it be lost.
[1:59:51] God's promise, he said, none of them
[1:59:54] shall be lost.
[1:59:57] Amen.
[1:59:58] Amen.
[2:00:00] The people that have business, that run
[2:00:03] business,
[2:00:05] they have these things. When you run a
[2:00:08] business, you must really push and push
[2:00:11] harder for you to be at a certain level.
[2:00:15] Whether in a good way or a bad way,
[2:00:20] that's a business language.
[2:00:23] If you need to kill,
[2:00:26] kill and have money. That's a business
[2:00:28] language.
[2:00:30] Not with the word of God.
[2:00:32] In the word of God, none will be lost.
[2:00:38] God has done it all. Relax in the word
[2:00:41] of God because God has done it all.
[2:00:45] All the father has given me will come to
[2:00:48] me and none of them is lost. Judas is
[2:00:55] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[2:00:59] and I will raise them up
[2:01:02] at the last days.
[2:01:05] In the word of God, you don't push. You
[2:01:09] don't push hard, but you wait
[2:01:12] upon the way and God will do everything
[2:01:16] for you.
[2:01:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; There are certain things in life. They
[2:01:27] not they don't need long prayers. They
[2:01:30] don't need overnight prayers. They don't
[2:01:33] need fasting. You just need to be in the
[2:01:36] way. And everything you are doing, God
[2:01:40] is doing it in you
[2:01:43] until when you speak is God speaking.
[2:01:47] When you walk, it's God walking. if it
[2:01:50] happened that you backslide. It's not a
[2:01:54] an incident.
[2:01:56] But it's what God knew.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Judas never wanted to backslide. He
[2:02:06] wanted to be in the will of God, but he
[2:02:09] was born
[2:02:10] to be damned.
[2:02:12] No one can change him. No one can change
[2:02:15] that. That was the will of God.
[2:02:19] He was predestinated for it.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; So the secret
[2:02:25] was with Rebecca.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; The secret
[2:02:29] is with women.
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; The women of the old
[2:02:38] God spoke to them. And God said to
[2:02:41] Rebecca, "You will have two children,
[2:02:44] two sons. I love this one. I hate this
[2:02:48] one. Then
[2:02:51] was leaving behind Jacob.
[2:02:55] Amen. Because is the one that God loves.
[2:03:03] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But Isaac when he comes home, he will
[2:03:07] look for Esau.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Where is my meat?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; You make it nice.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:17] is is us men.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; If we eat, we forget the process.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; But women,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; they are focusing
[2:03:28] on what God
[2:03:30] told them.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; You see men,
[2:03:37] they are attracted by this chicken dust.
[2:03:45] Hey, more especially in
[2:03:49] there too many. When I look at all the
[2:03:52] locations
[2:03:55] has got many chicken dust,
[2:04:05] there's a cow head.
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:10] The men go home with full stomach.
[2:04:16] Whether the children had food or not
[2:04:20] doesn't matter.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; They've eaten a cow head
[2:04:27] and I've never seen a woman doing that.
[2:04:31] If you can see a woman
[2:04:34] eating a takeway, she doesn't complain.
[2:04:37] She will keep some.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; If you ask what is this provision for?
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; She will say we taking the provision
[2:04:45] today.
[2:04:50] The only thing when you get home
[2:04:58] and Relax. You relax.
[2:05:04] None of your business.
[2:05:07] Let's respect our women.
[2:05:10] Amen.
[2:05:13] I I saw it the other day. I said to my
[2:05:16] wife, "Let's just go to the mall
[2:05:19] together. Let's remind oursel about that
[2:05:22] time when we didn't have kids, when we
[2:05:26] were still young." He said, "Sure." We
[2:05:29] get to the mall. We had some coffee. We
[2:05:32] had some ice cream, the nice meal. When
[2:05:36] we leave
[2:05:38] something,
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; I saw her having something
[2:05:42] my hands in the pocket.
[2:05:44] And then I said, "What about this?"
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; We left the child at home.
[2:05:55] I was saying there's conflicts at home.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; But let let him also taste this
[2:06:01] provision.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; It's the nature of a woman, they will
[2:06:04] focus on their keys, what they've been
[2:06:08] called to that when God, that's why God
[2:06:12] will come and speak to the women about
[2:06:15] their kids. Our wives know our kids.
[2:06:21] Amen. It's it's natural
[2:06:24] you like it or not. That is why our
[2:06:27] wives will give our kids the names as
[2:06:32] per what the angel of God speak to them.
[2:06:42] Esso was the same.
[2:06:45] Esso was the same
[2:06:47] in his character.
[2:06:50] Was a better man.
[2:06:51] than Jacob. But Rebecca didn't look at
[2:06:55] the better man than Jacob. He look at
[2:06:59] what God has said about
[2:07:03] he was more of a gentleman.
[2:07:07] He loved his father and the things that
[2:07:10] he's done. But God chose Jacob.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Because Jacob They think he was cified
[2:07:26] he was massed.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; And then mama was even telling him
[2:07:37] my son, you are loved by God, you will
[2:07:41] be a great nation again.
[2:07:44] And this name Jacob will be changed to
[2:07:48] Israel.
[2:07:50] Hallelujah.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Israel is the nation that God has loved.
[2:07:56] Rebecca was always preaching to Jacob
[2:08:00] that one day there will be a nation that
[2:08:04] comes from you and loved by God and it
[2:08:08] happened exactly.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Is the month for the mama.
[2:08:19] I'm encouraging you.
[2:08:21] Keep on doing the
[2:08:24] keep on making us proud.
[2:08:27] Keep on looking after our kids.
[2:08:30] Keep on doing what God has told you.
[2:08:37] Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Let me take another character.
[2:08:40] Esther,
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; a woman.
[2:08:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; One day,
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; oh, let me read this. I will explain.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Marriage of the lamb.
[2:08:58] Marriage of the lamb spoken with
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; marriage of the lamb.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; We know that little book of Esther.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; How that Mai,
[2:09:05] his uncle had a daughter and was down
[2:09:10] during the times of the reigns of
[2:09:15] beautiful type there.
[2:09:18] The king, one of the greatest king in
[2:09:20] the world that day.
[2:09:23] He had a great feast
[2:09:26] and he called the queen to come set by
[2:09:29] him.
[2:09:31] She wouldn't do it. She refused.
[2:09:35] So what did he do?
[2:09:38] He was so humiliated,
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:41] didn't know what to do that his own wife
[2:09:45] wouldn't come.
[2:09:47] to what the wife of the king
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; of Mary and Pesia.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; You see why previously I said
[2:09:58] we are amazed
[2:10:00] of how Israel
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; hit Iran
[2:10:05] internally.
[2:10:08] Things started here.
[2:10:10] Esther
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Esther
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; being a Jewish girl
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; was married
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; to the king of Iran.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; So in Iran they are Israelites. They are
[2:10:24] in the intelligence of Iran.
[2:10:28] They are in the media of Iran.
[2:10:32] They are in the business of Iran.
[2:10:35] They are in the army of Iran. Because
[2:10:38] man and the patience is Iran.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Esther was there.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; When he was there,
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; then Mori
[2:10:49] had the message that Israel is in Iran
[2:10:55] shall be killed. And he said to Esther,
[2:10:58] "You are the one that is responsible
[2:11:01] because you are the wife of the king."
[2:11:05] Then Esther said, "Come what may,
[2:11:09] queen or no queen. I will stand for what
[2:11:13] I believed in. We need those women that
[2:11:16] will stand for what they believed in."
[2:11:20] He said, "I will stand for my nation.
[2:11:23] As long as I live, they will not kill
[2:11:26] them.
[2:11:27] In those days, when you want to see the
[2:11:30] king, you need a permission. Esther
[2:11:33] said, "No, I don't need permission.
[2:11:38] I go and see the king.
[2:11:41] He killed me. So be it. But I need to
[2:11:45] save my nation."
[2:11:47] Esther prepare herself and go to see the
[2:11:50] king. When she's there, the king point
[2:11:55] this road unto her
[2:11:58] it was mercy upon her.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Then Esther started to narrate the
[2:12:07] story.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; King,
[2:12:12] there's a problem in the nation.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; There's a problem in the country.
[2:12:19] Amen. Amen. A certain nation
[2:12:22] that I belong to
[2:12:24] are on the verge
[2:12:27] of damn nation.
[2:12:30] They want to kill us. That's where the
[2:12:33] king realized
[2:12:35] and married an Israeli
[2:12:38] and she stood for that. She risk her
[2:12:40] life.
[2:12:42] You know when you risk your life,
[2:12:45] God is protecting you.
[2:12:48] For the word of God, if you save your
[2:12:51] life, God leaves you
[2:12:55] with your
[2:12:58] one of the days.
[2:13:00] And one of the
[2:13:03] king responded
[2:13:06] by saying,
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; "Who's that?"
[2:13:10] And then you know the story. Go and read
[2:13:12] the whole chapter.
[2:13:14] He made something like a party. He
[2:13:17] invited the king, his men, ammon
[2:13:24] everyone.
[2:13:25] Then he he started to explain to the
[2:13:28] king that the person who want to kill
[2:13:31] me, who want to kill my nation is
[2:13:35] harmon.
[2:13:38] It was not nice because Hmon hated
[2:13:42] Israel
[2:13:43] hated
[2:13:45] when he pass everyone will bow. But when
[2:13:50] is there he couldn't bow for him because
[2:13:53] he say I must worship the true God alone
[2:13:59] nor any other man in this world
[2:14:03] be that I should be killed. So be it.
[2:14:08] Brothers and sisters, don't be scared.
[2:14:11] Don't try to save this flesh.
[2:14:14] Renom says, "Everything that you see
[2:14:18] with a naked eye has a beginning, has an
[2:14:22] end,
[2:14:25] it will have an end. Look unto the
[2:14:28] everlasting arm."
[2:14:31] Amen. Amen. Then the discussion went on
[2:14:34] and on
[2:14:36] and then at the end the king said, "I've
[2:14:40] heard there's a rope in Hmon's house.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; That was Hmon
[2:14:47] house. That was meant to hang.
[2:14:54] That rope must hang."
[2:14:58] Amen.
[2:14:59] Amen.
[2:15:03] Who took that risk?
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; A woman
[2:15:13] knew the truth. He stood for the truth.
[2:15:16] But you are scared and he will go to to
[2:15:19] to Esther.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Our life are in your hands.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say your wife is your your life
[2:15:29] is in the head of a woman?
[2:15:40] Amen.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; But said to Esther,
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; you are the only
[2:15:46] rescue to us.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; And Esther
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; stand for it. Amen.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Modi was hanged.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; And Modi I mean I mean Hammon was
[2:15:57] hanged.
[2:16:01] took charge
[2:16:04] in Iran.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; So the Israelites used to rule in Iran.
[2:16:10] That is why they were not scared of
[2:16:12] them. That is why they were killing
[2:16:16] them.
[2:16:19] Amen. Amen. So we thank Esther
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; for his stand. I wish today we could
[2:16:28] have esters today that can stand for
[2:16:31] this message.
[2:16:33] Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; when we say a nation
[2:16:40] we mean the conduct of a woman.
[2:16:44] If the woman is not in their position,
[2:16:48] nation is doomed.
[2:16:51] That is why in the Jewish culture
[2:16:56] they say a child is of a woman.
[2:17:01] In our culture
[2:17:03] a child is of a man.
[2:17:07] Do you understand? And do you understand
[2:17:10] why the Jews say a child is of a woman
[2:17:16] not of a man? Is because of one thing.
[2:17:19] The woman should keep them secret
[2:17:25] should be holy life.
[2:17:29] If they are holy and they live holy life
[2:17:33] whatever
[2:17:35] comes to them will remain holy. That is
[2:17:38] the reason that is why Israel was not
[2:17:42] allowed
[2:17:44] to marry to other nation. When they
[2:17:47] realized that they were marrying other
[2:17:50] nation
[2:17:51] and they want to get rid of them, God
[2:17:54] said to them, "A child is of a woman,
[2:17:59] those people are Israelites,
[2:18:02] bring them to Israel."
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:10] You know when men are alone
[2:18:13] they can fight and do whatever they want
[2:18:17] but when the women come state has
[2:18:20] changed.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:27] Even if you are a strong man
[2:18:30] beating every man around.
[2:18:32] Yeah. Having all this
[2:18:35] beating them around.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; It's men fighting.
[2:18:38] But if your wife can come
[2:18:41] and just hold you
[2:18:45] saying you make people to love at us
[2:18:49] and all this power just
[2:18:51] [Music]
[2:18:53] you will see that man being humble.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; The woman has spoken.
[2:18:58] They are powerful.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Say hold me. I'm going to kill him. Hold
[2:19:04] me.
[2:19:06] The woman won't say hold.
[2:19:09] She will just look.
[2:19:12] You see the things you are teaching
[2:19:13] children
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; and he won't she won't repeat.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; You will see M
[2:19:24] saying take her be careful
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; going another way.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; The woman has spoken.
[2:19:34] Yeah.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's true.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; It happens to Elana.
[2:19:40] Elana had two wives. Benina and Hana.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Benina had kids.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't care whether Hana has kids or
[2:19:50] not.
[2:19:53] What can we do? Here are my kids. But
[2:19:55] Hana couldn't sleep. That's why she will
[2:20:00] pray,
[2:20:01] pray until the priest thought she was
[2:20:05] drunk.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; And when that woman pray,
[2:20:13] the product she's going to bring is the
[2:20:17] product from God. We don't hear anything
[2:20:21] about the children of Hana of of of
[2:20:24] Benina, but we started to hear about the
[2:20:28] children of Hana
[2:20:31] being Samuel,
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God. That that's a child.
[2:20:37] That's a child of a prayer of a woman.
[2:20:45] Forward we go. Hana said we cannot go
[2:20:49] forward without myself having a son of
[2:20:54] my own womb
[2:20:58] until the priest said she's drunk. When
[2:21:02] she appro when he the priest approached
[2:21:04] him
[2:21:07] started to realize that this woman was
[2:21:11] praying for something. And the priest
[2:21:13] said to that woman
[2:21:17] prayed for.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, let's hold on
[2:21:26] because we are the bride
[2:21:29] of our Lord Jesus.
[2:21:32] We are the woman that God has chose.
[2:21:38] Don't get discouraged.
[2:21:40] There will be people, mocking at you,
[2:21:44] despising you, keep on holding on, keep
[2:21:48] on praying, keep on calling the name of
[2:21:51] God.
[2:21:53] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Let me read what brother Brandham
[2:21:56] saying.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Notice
[2:22:01] didn't wait now.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Didn't wait now.
[2:22:06] Yes. God could have put a baby in her
[2:22:08] arms right now.
[2:22:12] But she went home happy
[2:22:15] knowing that in due season
[2:22:18] God will bring it to pass.
[2:22:21] That kind of people we need today
[2:22:26] taking God
[2:22:28] his way.
[2:22:33] Like today sometimes we called fanatics.
[2:22:39] because we pray and cried out. We're not
[2:22:43] fanatics,
[2:22:45] misunderstood,
[2:22:48] Amen.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; You won't be like them.
[2:22:52] Be who you are.
[2:22:56] Young sisters,
[2:22:58] don't be like them at university.
[2:23:02] Be a unique sister.
[2:23:07] Amen.
[2:23:08] Leave the mark.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; To the people. They will not tell you
[2:23:15] now. But they know the truth. They might
[2:23:18] say it later that there was a girl at
[2:23:22] this university. He was not like them.
[2:23:26] She was so unique. You left the mark.
[2:23:29] They will not forget your name.
[2:23:35] Amen.
[2:23:36] Amen.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:41] Let's take another character.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this one is collective.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; During the time of Saul,
[2:23:54] he was a warrior.
[2:23:57] The Bible says
[2:23:59] Saul
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; was tall,
[2:24:02] handsome
[2:24:04] and he was a warrior and he killed
[2:24:07] thousand people.
[2:24:09] He won the battles
[2:24:12] and everybody was praising him.
[2:24:15] And the women started the song that Saul
[2:24:19] Saul started the song
[2:24:23] Saul that he killed thousands.
[2:24:27] But David killed thousands of thousands.
[2:24:35] Ah,
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; now you see women can put you in
[2:24:37] trouble.
[2:24:43] Yeah,
[2:24:46] my soul now is happy.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; The women are praising me.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Then they have put David in the problem
[2:24:58] now.
[2:25:02] Saul hated David.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you how can they say you
[2:25:07] killed many. That means you are taking
[2:25:10] my glory.
[2:25:14] Then God sees the heart of Saul
[2:25:19] and his spirit
[2:25:21] lived him.
[2:25:24] The spirit of God. Brothers and sisters,
[2:25:28] let's walk carefully.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Let's check once more.
[2:25:33] If the spirit of God is still in us,
[2:25:38] you might worship, continue worship, but
[2:25:42] the spirit of God no longer in you.
[2:25:45] Look, do the introspection.
[2:25:48] Ensure that in your heart, there's no
[2:25:52] envy. There's no bitterness. There's no
[2:25:55] grieving spirit.
[2:25:57] You are pure, you love all the children
[2:26:00] of God.
[2:26:03] when you walk
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; ensured
[2:26:07] because the women were honest. The women
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; were honest.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; And then Saul started to have envy,
[2:26:16] bitterness and hatred against
[2:26:20] David.
[2:26:25] Yeah, you can sing
[2:26:29] can sing
[2:26:31] harvest
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; sings better from that day
[2:26:37] harvest.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; I start to hate harvest.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Why are you outshining me? Why
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; can I tell you we are not in a
[2:26:44] competition?
[2:26:49] Our God sends things harmoniously.
[2:26:55] The singers are there. The preachers are
[2:26:57] there, the deacons are there, the elders
[2:27:00] are there, the sisters, everyone is
[2:27:04] participating in the body of the Lord
[2:27:07] Jesus Christ. If you come here to sing
[2:27:12] out shining others, try next door. Not
[2:27:16] here.
[2:27:21] Amen.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; So these women sign to be honest.
[2:27:27] Hey, they cost trouble.
[2:27:30] If you are try to be honest this
[2:27:32] morning, you might be in trouble.
[2:27:38] Amen. Amen. We we we we appreciate
[2:27:42] the children of God who stand for the
[2:27:45] cause of what they believe in. When you
[2:27:49] stand the cause of what you believe in,
[2:27:52] you forsake all.
[2:27:58] I was reading a quote last night. I
[2:28:02] didn't put here because it didn't talk
[2:28:04] about women.
[2:28:06] I'm having women code only here this
[2:28:08] morning.
[2:28:10] Brother Benham was saying
[2:28:13] if he wanted to be the most richest
[2:28:17] person in the world
[2:28:21] would have been like this.
[2:28:24] One day
[2:28:26] he pray for someone
[2:28:29] of a rich person.
[2:28:33] Now they signed $500
[2:28:37] US $500,000
[2:28:41] $500.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; They give it to brotherham
[2:28:46] say no.
[2:29:00] Now I can't continue asking what I
[2:29:02] wanted to ask.
[2:29:05] You wouldn't reject that offer
[2:29:11] because money
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; has made many casualities.
[2:29:23] Brother Brenham should be our example.
[2:29:28] should learn from him the prophet of the
[2:29:31] age.
[2:29:32] God showed brother Brenham a well of oil
[2:29:37] that can sustain him sustain him
[2:29:41] the generation and generation of brother
[2:29:45] Brenham said no
[2:29:50] would you refuse that if you could have
[2:29:53] refused it
[2:29:59] going around looking for the diamond
[2:30:01] stones
[2:30:07] You are quiet because probably you want
[2:30:09] them.
[2:30:11] Let's learn. Let me tell you. I was
[2:30:15] talking to the brothers yesterday.
[2:30:17] I know this brother of mine, very nice
[2:30:20] brother, very close friend of mine.
[2:30:23] He has money. He was traveling with a
[2:30:27] white man. They were traveling to Kimali
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; to get some stones.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; They had 120,000 cash.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Brother the message. When they get to
[2:30:41] Kimali, they meet those people
[2:30:45] stone.
[2:30:47] Five of them. They park somewhere. They
[2:30:50] open the stone and they say, "Bring the
[2:30:54] money." It was in the briefcase.
[2:30:57] Open it. put it on the table. 120,000
[2:31:00] cash,000.
[2:31:02] When the brother, took the stone, tried
[2:31:05] to test, they pull out their arm. They
[2:31:09] said, "Now you die here."
[2:31:13] Then they say, "Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
[2:31:15] so sorry." And they put their guns back.
[2:31:18] When they put their guns back, they took
[2:31:20] this stone. I I don't remember the first
[2:31:24] town after Kimali towards here.
[2:31:28] on N12 N12.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; They stopped there because they were
[2:31:32] following them. They were following
[2:31:34] them, but they were driving
[2:31:36] Mercedes-Benz Slas. You know,
[2:31:39] Mercedes-Benz,
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; you won't run after it. It was too fast.
[2:31:44] 240 km per hour. He was telling me they
[2:31:49] stopped them. When they stopped there,
[2:31:51] they wanted to test.
[2:31:54] When when they wanted to test the stone,
[2:31:57] when they checked the stone, they were
[2:31:59] fake.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; They could have died for fake diamonds.
[2:32:10] Yeah.
[2:32:13] Okay.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; There's this woman.
[2:32:20] We're talking about women.
[2:32:25] That woman,
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; let's read the Bible and hear what it
[2:32:30] says. You will love her.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; In First Samuel.
[2:32:38] Sure. When I was reading this,
[2:32:43] I said, "Yeah,
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; we need women like Abigail."
[2:32:49] 1 Samuel
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; chapter 25
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; we can read verse 2 and three
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; don't hate me we have passed on the
[2:33:04] diamond issue is a close case
[2:33:08] let's read
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 25 from verse 1 to 3
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; no 2 to3
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; 2 to3
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; yes
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; and there There was a man in mourn whose
[2:33:22] possessions were in Camel and the man
[2:33:25] was very great and he had 3,000 sheep
[2:33:29] and a thousand goats and he was sharing
[2:33:32] his sheep in camel.
[2:33:35] Now the name of the man was Naba and the
[2:33:39] name of his wife Abig and she was a
[2:33:42] woman of good understanding
[2:33:44] and of a beautiful countenance.
[2:33:47] But the man was ch child chalish and
[2:33:51] evil in his doings and he was of the
[2:33:54] house of Caleb.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Mark that he was from the house of
[2:33:57] Caleb.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; Caleb.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Read read verse 14.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; And verse 14.
[2:34:04] But one of the young men told Abigail
[2:34:07] Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David
[2:34:11] sent messengers out of the wilderness to
[2:34:13] salute our master, and he railed on
[2:34:16] them.
[2:34:19] Let me just give you the brief story. Go
[2:34:20] and read the whole chapter.
[2:34:26] This man
[2:34:28] from the house of Caleb
[2:34:32] was rich.
[2:34:34] Had many sheep and everything.
[2:34:37] All the money of those days
[2:34:40] and he had a wife.
[2:34:44] Yeah. I respect Abigail.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; When this man had money,
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; he do whatever he wanted
[2:34:57] because he had everything.
[2:35:00] Now, one of the days when David and them
[2:35:05] in the mountain, they just saw the
[2:35:09] people of Naba Nab
[2:35:14] and then they protected them because
[2:35:17] David knowing very well are from the
[2:35:20] lineage of Caleb.
[2:35:23] They are Israelites
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; and he need to protect and then they
[2:35:28] protected. After protecting them, he
[2:35:32] said to this man, "Go and greet the
[2:35:35] master." When they get there, they tell
[2:35:39] him about David.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who's David from the son
[2:35:46] of Jesus? Who's there?"
[2:35:52] They say if you want to be to be known
[2:35:57] by your whole relative
[2:36:00] you must be rich. If you are poor they
[2:36:04] don't know you.
[2:36:07] But if you are rich everyone will say
[2:36:10] it's my uncle it's my cousin it's my
[2:36:13] brother.
[2:36:15] Even if you are not related because you
[2:36:18] are related to a rich man.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; David knew him but he don't know David
[2:36:25] and they were drinking. You know when
[2:36:28] sometimes you are in the house
[2:36:32] you find the brothers are talking the
[2:36:35] sister is singing and they are talented
[2:36:38] these people in the kitchen
[2:36:41] cooking
[2:36:43] singing but the other ear is listening
[2:36:46] to what you saying
[2:36:48] very much talented.
[2:36:52] You will think you are in a secret
[2:36:54] chamber.
[2:36:56] Just come and give you and wipe
[2:37:00] [Applause]
[2:37:02] you
[2:37:05] when the brothers leave.
[2:37:11] You are now going astray.
[2:37:15] How can you speak so badly?
[2:37:17] God will punish you.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; How did you hear?
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Yeah.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; Am I lying?
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Abigail was making food
[2:37:33] and he had a talking. They were talking
[2:37:37] about David. Who's he is a disaster.
[2:37:41] They don't like him. They were doing
[2:37:43] this.
[2:37:45] Abigail was there. When everybody left,
[2:37:50] he went to her husband. He said, "You
[2:37:54] messed up." The man who was drunk, he
[2:37:58] got sober immediately.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:38:09] something shake you
[2:38:11] 95% alcohol, you become sober.
[2:38:17] The first thing you will need
[2:38:20] water.
[2:38:22] It will appear
[2:38:25] because the woman of
[2:38:30] the woman who knew who David was
[2:38:34] said to her husband, we are killed
[2:38:36] today.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; That man became sober immediately.
[2:38:47] Then
[2:38:48] Abigail
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; even said
[2:38:52] to her husband because your name
[2:39:00] your name said who you are which one I'm
[2:39:05] going to rescue
[2:39:08] my family.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; You read verse 18.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; Those are the woman
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; you can bank on
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; very much careful.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. Then Abigail made haste and
[2:39:30] took 200 loaves and two bottles of wine
[2:39:34] and five sheep ready rest and five
[2:39:37] measures of patched corn
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; and in 100 clusters of raisins
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; and 200 cakes of figs
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; and laid them ones
[2:39:48] be
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; and she said unto
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; stop there you can go to 23. Then she
[2:39:54] she started to prepare something
[2:39:56] for David to stop his wrath.
[2:40:02] That's a woman.
[2:40:05] Verse 23.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; But this man will say,
[2:40:10] "Oh, he's a man and
[2:40:12] he can come. This woman I will read what
[2:40:15] said
[2:40:19] before we we read 23. Listen to this.
[2:40:23] What did he say
[2:40:25] about the old David? He was up there.
[2:40:31] She said
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; that is Abigail
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; to David.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Your soul,
[2:40:37] you can see Abigail knew who David was.
[2:40:42] Your soul is wrapped
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; in a bundle of joy.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; When Abigail
[2:40:52] great woman that met David said, "We
[2:40:57] know that your enemies will flung out
[2:41:02] like a sling
[2:41:06] sling." That's right. Because you are
[2:41:08] wrapped in the bundle of the lap of God.
[2:41:14] Abigail knew that you cannot challenge
[2:41:19] the anointed one of
[2:41:22] But his man was foolish. But the woman,
[2:41:27] the woman make it clear and say none can
[2:41:32] stand before David. David is the
[2:41:35] anointed man of God.
[2:41:37] Try, challenge your pastor.
[2:41:41] I don't want to go further. Amen.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; He is the anointed man of God.
[2:41:47] Amen.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; Talk better about him.
[2:41:51] I won't go further, but he is the
[2:41:54] anointed man. Verse 23.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 23.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; And when Abigail saw David, she hasted
[2:42:04] and lighted off the earth and fell
[2:42:06] before David on her face and bowed
[2:42:09] herself to the ground.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; That has rescued the entire family.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; David, look at the woman. Look at the
[2:42:19] boys because he said to the boys, "Kill
[2:42:22] all of them." But when Abigail, a woman
[2:42:27] took a stand, a right stand, despising
[2:42:32] his foolish husband,
[2:42:36] things turn around.
[2:42:39] Brothers, be careful what you're talking
[2:42:41] amongst the women,
[2:42:44] amongst your kids. We'll catch up with
[2:42:46] you one day.
[2:42:54] And then David
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; take his sword
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; back to his place
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; because the woman respected him.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; Don't just go forward
[2:43:11] as a man.
[2:43:14] Don't hear from a woman.
[2:43:17] Let's continue.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Women are powerful.
[2:43:28] But I'm saying this because it's their
[2:43:31] month.
[2:43:37] There's a woman
[2:43:39] by the name of
[2:43:43] mother to Solomon.
[2:43:45] a woman of valor.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; He said to David
[2:43:55] that
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; you promise me
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; that my son will be the king after you.
[2:44:04] But what are you doing now? Because
[2:44:06] Adonijah
[2:44:09] took the throne.
[2:44:11] David said, "No, no, no. That will never
[2:44:13] happen." Solomon.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; Solomon
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; is the king.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Who put Solomon on the throne?
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; His mother.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; David forgot.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; But the woman says
[2:44:30] that seat,
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; that throne
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; belongs to my son.
[2:44:45] Amen.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, it happened.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be fast.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Another woman, Jezebel.
[2:44:59] I just want to show you how powerful
[2:45:02] woman is.
[2:45:10] Sometimes
[2:45:12] you can go to work,
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; come back home angry as you can get that
[2:45:18] from
[2:45:19] this one, this one
[2:45:22] they don't want me, they want this one
[2:45:26] and your wife will just say
[2:45:29] and she will make after making coffee
[2:45:36] I've already started the car. Let's go.
[2:45:39] and buy a gun and then we're going to
[2:45:41] kill them all.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; Even if you didn't have money,
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; you're going to make it
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; because the wife said so.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Because the gun shoot them all. That's
[2:45:53] how powerful they can.
[2:45:55] Yes.
[2:46:01] He came home angry.
[2:46:10] threw himself on the sofa.
[2:46:16] I'm a king but they undermine me
[2:46:21] sat next to him. Don't forget who you
[2:46:23] are. You are the king and no one can
[2:46:28] challenge you.
[2:46:33] He put him in a dungeon
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; appeal
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; living.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Let's hear what the brother says. The
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; invasion of the United States.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; He said, but
[2:46:46] Ahab just fell for her
[2:46:50] because she was preaching,
[2:46:52] I suppose. men.
[2:46:55] It couldn't be nothing else but her
[2:46:58] because of her wicked as she was
[2:47:02] and she come over there and then cause h
[2:47:07] cause being wrapped up with her like
[2:47:09] that
[2:47:11] loved her. Why? He caused all Israel to
[2:47:16] sin,
[2:47:18] to go against God and to tear down the
[2:47:21] altars of God,
[2:47:24] build up altars of Balim.
[2:47:27] And they they they had Bal worship all
[2:47:29] throughout Israel
[2:47:32] at that time. Now his wife has caused
[2:47:36] righteous Nabot.
[2:47:40] Many of you has read of him how he took
[2:47:43] his garden.
[2:47:46] deceit.
[2:47:48] Saw
[2:47:49] a lie and a false witness against him
[2:47:54] because she wanted to do something for
[2:47:56] her husband
[2:47:58] and killed a righteous man in order to
[2:48:01] get a guard and just join close to the
[2:48:03] palace.
[2:48:06] Now the vengeance of Nabot
[2:48:11] will come from God.
[2:48:15] all this
[2:48:17] God was looking down.
[2:48:19] So the prophet Elijah
[2:48:22] which was great mighty servant of God
[2:48:26] prophesied and told Jezebel
[2:48:30] what will happen to her. He told Ahab
[2:48:34] that the dogs
[2:48:36] will leak his own blood.
[2:48:39] Now when God has said anything
[2:48:42] cost them days the direct way
[2:48:47] of the Lord came through the prophet
[2:48:52] Ahab's blood
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; was leaked by dogs.
[2:48:59] Jezebel's blood, I'm saying,
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; Ahab's blood
[2:49:05] was leaked by dogs.
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; Jezebel's blood was leaked by dogs. That
[2:49:13] was the vengeance from God.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, don't fight your
[2:49:18] battle.
[2:49:20] Let God fight your battle. The vengeance
[2:49:22] is from God. Let God do everything for
[2:49:25] you.
[2:49:27] You will see how much he loves you.
[2:49:32] Don't be like vengeance.
[2:49:35] Don't be like Jezebel
[2:49:38] who misled
[2:49:39] her own husband.
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:42] Be like Abigail
[2:49:44] protected the family.
[2:49:47] [Music]
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Let's read Matthew chapter 28.
[2:50:06] and look at time. Amen.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 28. Let's read from
[2:50:11] verse one
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; until 7.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; Matthews 28 from verse one until 7.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:20] In the end of the Sabbath, as it began
[2:50:22] to dawn toward the first day of the
[2:50:24] week, came Mary Magdalene and the other
[2:50:27] Mary to see the Sapala.
[2:50:30] And behold, there was a great
[2:50:32] earthquake, for the angel of the Lord
[2:50:34] descended from heaven, and came and
[2:50:37] rolled back the stone from the door, and
[2:50:40] set upon it. His countenance was like
[2:50:43] lightning, and his remnant white as
[2:50:45] snow. And for fear of him the keepers
[2:50:49] did shake and became as dead men. And
[2:50:53] the angel answered and said unto the
[2:50:54] woman, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye
[2:50:58] seek Jesus which was crucified. He is
[2:51:02] not here, for he is risen, as he said,
[2:51:06] come see the the place where the Lord
[2:51:09] lay
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; and go quickly and tell his disciples
[2:51:13] that he is risen from the dead. And
[2:51:16] behold, he goeth before you in Galilee,
[2:51:19] there shall ye see him. Lo, I have told
[2:51:22] you.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Talking to the women.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; Women,
[2:51:42] let's just respect women's month.
[2:51:46] been attacking men. No, I'm just
[2:51:50] encouraging our sisters,
[2:51:53] the word of God, the Lord. We are very
[2:51:56] much aware
[2:51:59] talking to them. You see here the angel
[2:52:03] is talking to women. The women had that
[2:52:07] ear of listening that on the third day
[2:52:12] he shall rise. Peter and them,
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; they had it. But
[2:52:22] let's fix our fishing lines.
[2:52:27] When they were fixing their fishing
[2:52:29] line,
[2:52:30] the women were there knowing he will
[2:52:34] arrive and they stand there. And the
[2:52:37] angel come and speak to the women. He's
[2:52:41] not here. is risen.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; You women go and tell them the disciples
[2:52:51] Peter, Thomas, Baramelo, Luke, Luke,
[2:52:57] every one of them, go and tell them that
[2:53:00] I shall meet them.
[2:53:03] Do you understand? Amen. Then the
[2:53:05] sisters has to run and tell them that he
[2:53:09] is risen. go to Galia, he will come and
[2:53:13] meet you.
[2:53:16] Amen. We must just keep on keeping on.
[2:53:20] You know the story of a Samaritan woman.
[2:53:23] How he got the message after getting the
[2:53:26] message. Jesus met her at the well.
[2:53:31] Then he went back to the city and tell
[2:53:34] them that Jesus whom we waited whom was
[2:53:39] spoken by the prophet.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; The last one
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; is this on Acts chapter 18. You know the
[2:53:52] scripture
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; uh verse 24- 26.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 24- 26.
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Apollo. Apollo. Apollo was a great man.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; A man who was preaching Jesus Christ
[2:54:08] genuinely
[2:54:10] time.
[2:54:12] Amen. Amen. And the Bible says Priscilla
[2:54:16] and Aquil went to attend their service.
[2:54:20] After hearing the word of God, Priscilla
[2:54:25] approached Apollo and said, "Men of God,
[2:54:28] you preach a powerful
[2:54:31] We enjoyed our stay here, but I want you
[2:54:36] to meet Paul.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; Brazil
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; never stay there and say
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; and started to preach to him. He said,
[2:54:52] "No, I'm not allowed to preach, but I
[2:54:55] can take this to Paul. You and Paul can
[2:55:00] talk about it.
[2:55:02] Our gospel,
[2:55:04] brothers and sisters,
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; they knew very well if he can meet Paul,
[2:55:13] we are going to baptize our
[2:55:19] gospel that we have, nothing can stop
[2:55:22] it.
[2:55:24] Keep on going with it.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; That is why when Timothy
[2:55:32] was ordained as a pastor but the
[2:55:35] ministers will say
[2:55:38] stay in the faith
[2:55:40] of Louise your grandmother.
[2:55:46] the women that stayed in the faith until
[2:55:50] a pastor, newly ordained pastor was
[2:55:54] asked to follow the faith of his
[2:55:59] grandmother.
[2:56:00] How powerful Louise was.
[2:56:08] I finish
[2:56:10] as the B coming
[2:56:13] because I'm done.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham,
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to meet him.
[2:56:21] He went through a lot.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your prophet.
[2:56:28] He went through a lot.
[2:56:35] Brother Brandham had a wife.
[2:56:38] Hope
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; she depart
[2:56:42] and she married Mid
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; and Mid
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; was 10 years younger than brother
[2:56:53] and let me read this
[2:56:56] and then here some time ago
[2:56:59] from the spoken do you now believe amen
[2:57:04] I will tell you a little story
[2:57:07] that you might not think was just right.
[2:57:12] I come in a room where the kitchen
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; and the whole house had been piled full
[2:57:21] this room that room downstairs
[2:57:25] everywhere. And then when I was getting
[2:57:29] through along about from early that
[2:57:33] morning, it was about 5:00.
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; We've been turning everybody away.
[2:57:42] The boys are at the gate. So for
[2:57:45] they keeping the people away. And I went
[2:57:49] out into the kitchen.
[2:57:51] There is my wife seat out there crying
[2:57:55] as hard as she could cry.
[2:57:58] Two girls, they were sitting on the
[2:58:01] floor and fighting over their blocks
[2:58:05] and the house was torn up.
[2:58:08] Everything that mirror said or my wife
[2:58:11] said, "Really, I'm going wild." She
[2:58:16] said, "This children hasn't had a bite
[2:58:19] to eat all day long.
[2:58:22] The kitchen
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; standing full, the house standing full
[2:58:29] and all. She said, "Oh, I said 35 years
[2:58:34] old
[2:58:36] whiteheaded
[2:58:39] and
[2:58:40] and stand between me
[2:58:45] and the public.
[2:58:50] You want me to explain this?
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a mess
[2:58:55] in the house of brother Bren.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; The man whom you think is perfect and he
[2:59:03] is
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; perfect. Look at the situation.
[2:59:08] When the wife was like that,
[2:59:11] mess in the house. Kids are going up and
[2:59:15] down, not allowing visitors in the
[2:59:18] house. And the wife said, "I'm going
[2:59:21] wild."
[2:59:23] But brother Brennan says she was young
[2:59:27] and she started to look like an old
[2:59:29] person. She was 35 years of age. But
[2:59:33] when you look at me, she was like 50
[2:59:36] years of age because of the condition of
[2:59:40] that day. Brother,
[2:59:43] look at her at the way she she
[2:59:46] stood between me and
[2:59:50] a woman of valor. Sister Miller against
[2:59:55] all odds, against all the criticism that
[2:59:58] brother Brandham had
[3:00:02] by the sight of brother Bren.
[3:00:05] We need such woman.
[3:00:07] Divorce is not a rescue. Amen.
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; But I have to say it.
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; Mira never stood there and say, "Billy,
[3:00:21] I leave the house." Mira just said to
[3:00:24] Billy, "I'm going wild, I'm confused. I
[3:00:28] don't have direction."
[3:00:30] But she stood by his side.
[3:00:33] Today, men and women, they want divorce
[3:00:36] as the rescue in their marriage.
[3:00:41] I know why you are quiet because others
[3:00:43] are thinking of divorce. It's not the
[3:00:46] way. Come back. Be like me. Stand for
[3:00:50] the what you saw before God and before
[3:00:54] the pastor before the church
[3:00:57] do part.
[3:01:05] I don't deny you divorcing, but it's not
[3:01:07] what we teach in this church.
[3:01:11] She said,
[3:01:12] &gt;&gt; "Oh, why? I just know don't know what to
[3:01:16] do."
[3:01:17] And the poor little fellow
[3:01:21] sorry for him. That is brother Brenham
[3:01:24] feeling sorry for me that what she went
[3:01:27] through irrespective of the condition of
[3:01:31] my wife I will stand by her side
[3:01:36] of the condition of your house
[3:01:40] you will stand by his side
[3:01:44] I know it's difficult to swallow but I
[3:01:46] have to say it
[3:01:50] because Today education,
[3:01:54] money
[3:01:56] has come into the church and the
[3:01:58] children of God they lost the taste of
[3:02:01] the message.
[3:02:03] This is not my time. This is not my
[3:02:06] time. Divorce is the solution. Not in
[3:02:09] this church.
[3:02:12] [Applause]
[3:02:15] be a woman or father
[3:02:19] who will say,
[3:02:21] "Whatever my husband is going through,
[3:02:24] whatever my wife is going through, I
[3:02:27] will kneel down. I will pray for the
[3:02:30] situation. God will rescue the
[3:02:32] situation, not the divorce because you
[3:02:36] make the devil."
[3:02:39] God bless you.
[3:02:48] Amen. Let's sing unto the Lord.
[3:03:00] Got
[3:03:13] something up.
[3:03:15] [Music]
[3:03:29] and shame. Go see

[3:12:19] about a certain woman that she realized
[3:12:22] something but whereas the brothers they
[3:12:25] didn't realize that thing and the pastor
[3:12:28] said it is because it's the bright age
[3:12:36] we are in the bright age.
[3:12:45] You got a certain purpose, but it's not
[3:12:48] the same purpose.
[3:13:12] to remind us about our sister, our
[3:13:15] women, our mothers, our grandmothers.
[3:13:47] This message is specific to those that
[3:13:50] hear you.

[3:14:57] to give us just that special gift
[3:15:02] because he is very unique
[3:15:07] is very unique because it's a gift from
[3:15:10] you to this church.

[3:15:15] to this world.

[3:19:39] Gracious Lord,
[3:19:41] we like to thank you once again, Father,
[3:19:43] for
[3:19:45] the mercy bestowed upon us.
[3:19:49] We have Lord Almighty
[3:19:52] brothers and sisters here
[3:19:55] that has surrendered
[3:19:57] their physical life and their spiritual
[3:20:00] life unto thee.
[3:20:03] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, you were so
[3:20:06] merciful
[3:20:07] that your word could be able to convince
[3:20:10] them as they are taking the new life.
[3:20:14] Gracious Lord about to go to the water
[3:20:18] Lord Almighty to be baptized to be
[3:20:20] totally immense in the water. We pray
[3:20:24] Lord Almighty and we thank you for what
[3:20:26] you have happened in their life. We pray
[3:20:29] as the brothers also are taking them in
[3:20:31] Father. May you be with them Lord
[3:20:33] Almighty and bring a supernatural
[3:20:36] understanding in their lives. Father we
[3:20:39] pray in the precious name of our Lord
[3:20:41] Jesus Christ. Amen. Acts
[3:20:45] [Applause]
[3:20:56] chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:21:01] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:21:03] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:21:06] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[3:21:09] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:21:12] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:21:14] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[3:21:16] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:21:19] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:21:22] them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[3:21:25] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:21:27] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:21:30] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:21:32] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:21:34] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:21:38] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:21:40] call.

[3:29:06] It's not because we ever testify to
[3:29:09] them. They had an intake of
[3:29:11] understanding, but you just called them
[3:29:14] because they are your children.

[3:29:19] look after their life.
[3:29:23] forchech.

[3:30:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And I put everything
[3:30:14] under your capable hand in the mighty
[3:30:16] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:30:18] Christ. Amen.

[3:30:39] Gondis,
[3:30:41] if you can just come forth, my brother,
