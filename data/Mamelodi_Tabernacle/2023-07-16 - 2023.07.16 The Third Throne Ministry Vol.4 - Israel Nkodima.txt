proceedings love God wants my father we know we are worthy to be here for you chose us before the foundation of the world for these things to reveal unto us Once Upon a Time you took Peter John and James up the mountain and reveal yourself unto them we were wondering why the other disciples were not up there we see exactly the same picture today amen the ministry of the Seven Seals was not open to all the message believers not to all but we are so privileged this morning we have such a servant whom you chose and put those Divine Ministry in our hearts we appreciate you so much not because we have done anything good before you but because you loved us and you chose us for these things to reveal unto us amen no matter what the people can say you put our pastor on a certain level where he draw up from the Lord God and fit this shipping us today we love you so much Lord we are with great anticipation once more this morning for when we sit down and listen to the men of God oh our heart will be bubble position will be in a level whereby any time when a Rapture took over we will be inside the scripture has been read many syllabuses in the universities were changes on an annual basis but not this one it comes from Eternal it will go to Eternity for only the Eternal people will be the one that will understand it for the Leonard has went astray but you kept us in this secret chamber for you to reveal everything unto us father God we love you so much bless our pastor this morning The Interpreter bless the Elders of the church bless the entire light [Music] but I've got may you heal our spirit yes may you settle in our hearts for today we'll know that you are in us we are in you we are the same we are one unit we love you so much we appreciate you Lord as we put all and you are capable and in the mighty name of our Lord and savior amen amen amen amen you may be seated we have read you well in his prayer the Elder here mentioned this part um it is not open to amen amen and is [Music] the three-fold Revelation then we have seen a great thing why it's not for everybody because threefold it comes in a three four it means that means that when it was opened it was open in a three-fold every person who is part of the three four who is foreign they are the only ones that hate him it is revealed in a three-fold only a um now for you to know it you're with him easy when you you are part of the three forms hey it's so wonderful to see this now I I want prolonged things we have already we're trying to bring things together and you remember Lassie we we were talking about the the second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 9. amen let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a fooling away first I mean I mean and and that that man of sin be revealed amen the Son of Perdition amen that right who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called God is it not happening yes some saying I know better than God another one says I'm more gifted than God another one saying God also made mistakes I'm looking at those things [Music] people talking against God others tearing the Bible Jesus what is happening amen amen and we are seeing these things we do not Wonder because he told us about this now I'm reading this part that says he he he is God seated in the temple of God showing himself that he is and forgiving people sins remember you know that yeah when I was who yet with you I told you this thing then he continues I'd like to have sit under some of his what I let me pass now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time yeah hinders him he will only be revealed after the bride is taken away he is doing his things already but there's something my only after the bride is taken away then this man of sins amen meaning that he can't do that while the bright is here he is already there foreign has been elected out of church every Church every church we see twins right one out of every Church just like you go back to Genesis actually all right now Even in our age it says there is twins you know twins they may look alike yeah as twins amen amen but with two different natures we had born as twins then the other one hated to the other ones twins nature each had a father but fella oh they are twins of the same mother yeah but two different fans all right now the true bread of Christ has been elected out of every church because twins no that's why they were supposed to be we were supposed to see the election it has already happened the Nature's different Natures in the same church but with different natures amen amen and no she did true bride has been selected out of every church because they come as twins the bride elected but out of every church is that the prophet speaking here amen amen so God bless you now we were looking also what we are looking at now um foreign there are people who are waiting for Satan they sold they are sold hey who will escape that is coming you must thank God for you early his child um I mean have you ever seen the wrath of God that's why it says Revelation chapter 10. chapter 7 verse 10 7 verse 10. Revelation chapter 12. you know the word um therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that dwell in them woo to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he had but a short time uh the Inhibitors of Heaven or of the earth and the Sea Island you know these people they are citizens of inhabitants of the earth and the sea look you are here brother but what is that in your cell phone yeah showing that you are not a Christian you are a churchgoers [Music] let me repeat it even next Sunday you will be here what is that in yourself it doesn't reflect age your testimony okay I don't know if they brought me the brother was saying he says okay okay he is repenting now the question is is no the answer is cell phones of the young people carrying another Ministry which is not of God all right okay let's go there now amen now the only thing the last thing that I will see is God and a man [Music] remote that's that's all who let us read this out of the Bible because in the book of Christ is the mystery of God reveals Christ is the mystery of God revealed I love this book so much earn Christ not not Jesus isn't Jesus Christ is the mystery discipline of God reveals because Christ is the anointed Jesus is his ethnic name but like brother Brandon says she was waiting all the annotate as she went around saying do we know something that the Rapture is coming I'm not talking about knowledge [Music] I'm talking about uh being part of it on the rapturing footings yeah on the runway really more Runway I'm waiting for Brother Elder gay person I hate him many times these things off Aviation so I've got some questions for some things that I don't understand amen amen and then he mentioned we are now on the runway now as you know a flying machine is not like a taxi is once it has taken off which is off now we as the children of God once he fella we take off then we are we are gone as we used to sing I have decided to follow Jesus what have you decided to become a church member or are you on the runway Runway the people on the runway you know we can go back we find men like Elijah let's go to this man when he was about to be taken up here he started to walk towards they're coming chariots we will understand the same experience foreign foreign working with God is that right so we are going to see the people who have already started to work oh man beautiful Hallelujah yes why it's already in them [Music] they are thinking of nothing else but the rapture they are not looking back they are on the runway once it has taken off okay I mean I don't know how many this morning [Applause] not turning back the engine is roaring already this is what we are looking at now I'm going to read only a few things now [Music] um let me go back to this the summer written woman brother Brendan says all this time she was going around talking about it the Messiah now that thing he said I know as the prophet says Christ today has been made [Music] I'm not I'm not saying Jesus I'm saying Christ the anointed has been made now to be made is when it's not when somebody reads it out and say Christ is when it is in you he is made known to you there amen and there's a sister she walked out there I wonder if she has any problems no you haven't seen the sister sister she walked out there you haven't seen it no no I have not noticed that okay all right because what is happening if every time we come together the devil also all right but if do we fear Him no please I mean we don't fear Him right amen we are here to worship here we are now let's look at his identification [Music] because if you are going in the Rapture he has to identify himself with you now [Music] he has already identified himself with us by saying I am here now for our journey when he identified himself to enock Enoch started to walk the Bible says he walked with God I believe there's some people today that are working with God they are looking they are no longer looking back nothing can stop them they are already on the runway and no turning back you know I was looking at the sitting thing that brother brother Branham spoke of electricity speaking about the revelation and only I don't have it here today the revelation of what it was a [Music] we have read that everybody remember amen the revelation of what it was you know it puts you off the things of the world if you see the Revelation what it was done you have the revelation of where you come from who are you to begin with where you come from where are you going otherwise it is just there Merry Go Round you know if you can say to a person walk around about this building do you know that now what's wrong you will get tired mm-hmm I mean I mean and for me to come to church again and go back and come to church just like that then I know that yeah I have to come back to church next Sunday again that is and come to church thank you and do his things but he can do anything I'm not talking about that kind of thing [Music] to me with you Lil Wayne coming here is a step forward foreign [Applause] I it's not a merry go around that like a a person he goes to church just the same as he went to church last week nothing changing nothing new it's just a routine I'm talking to an individual come on as brothers is your life worthy of the Gods okay that's why now before we close I want to reach this uh about his identify Christ identification [Music] you as a Christian have Christ identified himself because before you can worship Him awesome you must be identified [Music] and when you are identified that's when he is identified [Music] then you can see me and God working together talking about eternal life you are talking about the life that will never cease nothing can disappoint that life nothing can stop that life you don't come to the end as you are working you are gradually getting out of this boat yeah yeah yeah they were saying everybody it is ready to take off the skin amen amen [Music] hey [Music] to put off that some have already started but they are putting it off they're living it [Applause] was like they say leave the world and the things of the world amen amen okay I mean all right all right it's something to do with a sister but she's fine okay Satan hates you such an awful and his agents the agents amen that's why I say we were battling and they were trying to attack and we fought that night okay how will it be when I put off now when I saw that snake there and they say it is ready to take off it doesn't remain naked [Music] the new one if you see the children of God amen amen becoming soft times where they have and they go there amen amen they repent from their shortcomings this is the life that is moving on they are living the things of the world because they are already in the rapture [Music] Simon talking to you individually are you experiencing the thing that I am saying I mean are you taking off as the Bible says think of the old man put on the new man amen amen it doesn't say renovated no it says thank you all right you know when a man arrives Maybe uh from the hot sun up outside there the sun is haunted the first thing you see him taking off but only when he arrives When we arrive D amen we take off the things of this world and put on a new man almost amen amen now what is human what is that okay you know you watch a person um who has bought a new car or something like that okay he doesn't drive it like the old one he used to drive it's a new one yeah um then I I was watching a young man he really didn't know what to do how to display that is [Music] back again he is trying to display amen amen you know I thought I would have taken him to the scrap yard to show him that accumulation is coming here [Applause] like a friend of mine I think I mentioned this he was coming down in mamelodi here alongside the graveyards now he came to to my house I was just passing there they gave Graves it was flooded by some thoughts do the people in mamelodi have they seen this graveyard so that was that a young man [Music] only he is ladies he's the one who came to the service the first time he came we were still at Vista Vista then he said close to closer to somebody who was dozing after this I was talking about the Battle of armagedding under such a great teaching can they be somebody I said Curry yes hey that that person Mutual the flesh now the body is in the service you know a person much who has come to identify or absolutely yes if perhaps there's a feeling that he's just about to those off you're seeing him struggling even standing here [Applause] because you know Christianity without the purpose is not Christians Church without their people no fruits all right now let's look at this I'm I'm I'm closing here you listening when Abraham Abraham because now we are so close I was even watching when they were that's yesterday uh this part that says the men the what what they call him now 666 what they call this man no they simply will sing the Beast oh I was trying to measure they they were saying the Beast the Beast is just about to reveal itself yeah and I said that that that's it it is [Music] I will read you the last thing you realize that as long as the bride is here do you know that because Christ The Mystery of God revealed it makes you and God I will read you the last thing it makes you and God I don't know maybe you'll understand one day what what it means to walk with God even when you are alone he is a friend to you so much that even when you are alone you can talk to him I'm not talking just about the Mere Christianity I'm thinking about something real yeah [Music] foreign [Music] then it is that right amen now the way the way he came the Lord Jesus Christ and logos yeah all right now it differ it is different from if you counter from if back there whoever um a child coming forward through actually sexual actual what what you call it um but if you are a child of God you came through the rainbow um was prepared for you foreign body fella the soul the soldier the life is part of God but this body is Earthly and was prepared for you no way now if you come in everybody will see that our neighbor in here is a different person [Applause] who is in this body we will see him I'm preaching now yeah and I'm serious but there's a person here after this they will go after their own time that young man she has things it depends whether your life is in a cell phone or in Christ the busiest thing today amen amen you can't sit with the person who you can't even talk sense when you are with somebody cell phone cell phone is not only in his hands can you see yourself amen amen sometimes you see one with three three cell phones this one in this one the whole day that brother is a singer from Switzerland fella fella you get what I mean if I say my garden will go together you say me and myself we'll go together the

those things I've got a better cell phone I'm still waiting for the right name for this one because [Music] all right let's close with this yeah everybody identifies himself with something did you know that what is your best friend is Christ Christ is my best friend whether I'm alone he works with me he speaks with me he's inviting you to walk with him to be with him all the time amen that makes me that makes my day when I wake up in the morning thinking about Christ it really makes my day because we start talking in the morning if you want a friend make your a friend find a real friend

foreign to go to that star there yeah hey it's something if you can visualize this he says you will be where you want to be [Applause] and I said God bless you brother brother I will be where I want to be I mean because if you are watching The Village we are thinking deeply you want to be there you want to be there you know how God puts these things you know looking at these things and you say to yourself but what is that what's this foreign [Music] amen you won't miss a point the point [Music] amen amen now inclusive you know in Jesus Christ he puts you where you are supposed to be the best place that I enjoy is to be with him you know when I look at that level when it says the revelation of what it was [Music] all right amen the revelation of it perhaps if you say to me I want to travel with you uh let me have the revelation of what it was a you want you don't understand the revelation of what it was it puts you into something have you ever thought of yourself where am I from and
