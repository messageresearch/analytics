your teeth a little bit more than that it's a Happy Time hallelujah amen because we are gathered here under the spoken word so we should start from the spoken word hallelujah amen let's go to the book of Acts eight amen pasta no no amen that's included to you God bless you amen so since this is a very up class which is like a university class I'm not to say a lot of things [Music] foreign and it says it reads and the energy of the roads began to feel saying allies and go towards the South and do the way of because down to Jerusalem into Gaza which is the desert I don't want to explain about the setting because I I'm here for almost five minutes so for me to say it it is in the Gaza in the desert it will take me a long time but I'll just say that it wasn't it is it and he allows and went and devote a man a utopian that means he was a Nubian that means he was from the continent which he could love most amen and a eunuch of great Authority he was of great Authority and Candace the queen of the Ethiopians who was in charge of all her treasure what come to Jerusalem to worship was returning and sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah's the prophet then the speech said to Philip begonia and joined thyself to the child and Phil blame neither to him and hate him be to the prophet Isaiah and said understand about what it is I are you understanding the what you are reading he said how can I understand except a man in me and he doesn't feel that he should come up and sit with him Hallelujah he was spoken away all the time but he still needed a man to guide him through the spoken word amen actually this scripture is very good I can go through so many things which are the scriptures which uh uh Paul being very well visited in the law but still needing ananias yeah Paul went to aranesque to tell him what he has been leading through the law you know what um closed uh post teaching was okay I'll tell you something maybe I've never heard it this was Paul's teaching Paul's teaching was to take the scroll and take a needle pass through the scroll and try to structurally challenging each other which scriptures have been pierced by that needle which quotations by that name so they will be saying oh if that needle is there that means it is this it is that it is that it is that is that that he knew all that but when they came to this light somebody and then he has to tell you no it's not just about knowing where the scripture is description this is hallelujah so um wordpressing my pastor Hallelujah for me Pastor kodima has been such that we I knew these quotations but you press them where they are supposed to be I think they're the man to tell me this quotation supposed to be there I'm supposed to be there it's not just about knowing it's about putting them in their right places Ethiopian needed Hallelujah so um God bless you my pastor I've learned a lot amen as for me I'm not speaking for you I'm speaking for myself for the other pastors we have benefited from my lord for my own presence [Music] not only that for some of us even physical when I remember when I broke my leg something happened one day we're just like seven days before the meetings in Malawi and my my wife was almost dying um please tell the pastor that we are in trouble here and actually when the meetings were starting on Friday my wife was there saving the pastor praise the Lord so we thank God for the gifts which school has given us you know the importance of a man cannot be over emphasized when God wanted you to have a wife to give you a man which is a woman to be a wife when God wants you to be born he gave you a gift a man for you to be born when God wanted you to do educated what did he give him a man for you to be educated when you are sick when God wanted to hear you what did he do amen amen hallelujah [Music] so when you went to University when you wanted to get your degree what did God God give you your mother teaches you ABCD and then you just turn for your father to tell you ABCD now it is time for the teacher to tell you everything he didn't say it's time for the prophet to tell you ABCD anyway but it continues on until today that where we are we need somebody to guide us this is the way hallelujah what place are we praise the name of the Lord for giving us a man who has stood with us all these seasons [Music] I'll just tell my own story I met Western kodima when I was only 23 years old he was very far because he was standing in front and I was at the back Hallelujah he never even knew I existed so years passed by um that was 1990 and in 1998. mostly it was mostly in the wrong way but about 2006 or seven that's when he came to blunder where now I had grown to a position of a deacon so the person says when the pastor comes you'll be the one driving him you remember Master yeah also I was the one driving him that time um I was very close but not too close to a point which I could see what to say on the other side yeah so I was driving past around uh we took just just like somebody to talk to his driver that was all but when it came to 2014 uh when I was a minister now full time minister um then something happened something happened which my brother said it yesterday but I didn't tell him that it happened to me that same way something happened which which you said yesterday I said I have seen that Pastor odima has got suffer that's what he told me yesterday so that's why I studied following Hallelujah so from there onwards it has been a different issue because now [Music] um those who stay closed they see as much as those that see much more than those who are far off those of us have stood closer to pastor podima we have seen nothing but the hand of God hallelujah amen for all these years we've been moving together he's our device to us his uh challenges uh his challenges to us uh actually uh can I say one two one more thing I'll say but uh please just do not take over it overboard amen for me it has come to a point to it even if I want to do a business [Music] [Applause] am I not a pastor so what should I was that another pastor like pasta I want to do this business there was another what business which I wanted to do he told me you are a pastor do this business [Music] [Applause] I was a little bit disappointed when I was coming back but what's the use of consultation if you cannot follow the leadership master I want to do this I will not say it because I don't want you to get hallucinating I think he said he said no my brother you are a pastor you can't do a business with more than 50 percent of your time that means the other side of your work will suffer amen so uh these are the issues which we when we speak about leadership and guidance uh the pastor is not just there to marry you and bury you is also there to be actually there to tell you exactly but even what type of business you want to go into and we thank God for that amen so the other business is the one who told me to do how to do it [Music] um I do it very comfortably you know the first skills it was about in my shooting I mean do you know that the schools up here [Music] two times season yes what about the first screws here too he had to aim when we come to the second schools because it was called now he didn't have to aim he was just saying hallelujah so when you are under a leadership like that and uh something has been led to you sometimes the surprises will be much more even if you don't understand but it requires a man to guide you so we thank God that uh uh we have don't worry my sister that is a man who can tell me right that's what a little girl a little brother told his little sister When the Lights Went Out Sister don't worry there is a man who can turn on the night amen let me stop there and I believe I've spoken to on behalf of my fellow pastors but uh Pastor kodima has been a Liberation to us and um if there are some who haven't seen that revelation it just come closer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] did nothing [Music] [Music] [Music] see me again [Music] [Music] please [Applause] [Music] introduce the people of the right thing they are nowhere okay anyway let me start with the assistance [Music] [Applause] amen and the children they can just come forth [Music] the sons and the daughters [Music] want them to come forth so that introduce them [Music] yes yes [Music] [Music] very good and they used to accommodate us they still accommodate us in their big houses uh [Applause] where's the song leader from Swaziland amen [Applause] [Music] amen God bless you amen we have sister we need we are from Swaziland my sister [Music] oh the young man on the keyboard [Music] amen amen we also have sister amen [Applause] [Music] and while you are standing you know there's a song that we sing in the church that was composed by the husband [Music] [Applause] then they composed amen Hallelujah [Applause] and they are singers we're gonna give them an opportunity [Music] amen amen and for now let's go back to the program I still want Pastor David to just give a testimony but let it be after a the musical item of Brother David it's Pastor David the musical item by brother Dave hallelujah amen you know when we're in the pastor kept saying I'm Israel so I was a little bit jealous and I raised my hand and I said I'm also the Prophet Daniel Brother David come from the family then thereafter would have a testimony by Pastor David God bless you I don't know [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] You Found Me lost and with no hope You Found Me look effort s you [Music] [Music] [Music] but you've always [Music] been let me know [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we've got a feeling [Music] [Music] [Laughter]

savior and King someday [Music] oh my God [Music] it is in Jesus name [Music] Jesus Christ you shall received [Music] someday [Music] [Applause] [Music] in his word to relax eyes in Jesus is Christ you shall receive hallelujah amen hey Pastor David just come forth and give us a testimony and immediately will give a speech on behalf of the elders amen [Music] and forgive me this is a very important testimony especially in my life so I need just to interpret this testimony amen it's very important God bless you greetings to watching I think is making a mistake because I can't talk for a short time because uh are you sure you won me okay so it's been a privilege that the Lord has given unto us Arena um [Music] saying this for being thankful to the Lord [Music] [Music] your network is your net worth so it means the people that you meet in life I want you to be better because you can only learn from somebody who is better than you and if God loves the church [Music] foreign [Music] I always remember um and there was somebody who really uh gave us a you see this thing when you get scared what they don't call it adrenaline yeah yeah something like that yeah when the man was preaching them so after that say hey I think you need to take us back home you know somebody else who's coming to Bridge I don't want you to miss it let's cool down so he was not sure he said are you sure [Music] [Music] [Music] all of us copy you say no we need to see that man so and that how many stories started that's when they started and we have every time we introduce him [Music] [Music] from that time when we we see the way the Lord has been using him to approach scriptures to handle the the the the the supernatural presence foreign foreign [Music] and we know we can't we we can't put together enough words foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] just coming from the trip in KitchenAid to speak about these things please next time you must never forget to invite me so God bless you so I was just saying our last trip in yeah it was another special one like many others I I don't even know where to start but things went so well like God was putting everything in place a few days [Music] [Music] because when they they welcome Us in that manner I think before I leave I told them brothers please when you come to us please don't expect we can do this so when I arrive I think Pastor Freddie and them were already there at the airport and it was very well so they charged me to preach all the same ones since I did not have pastor kodima with me it was very tiring I was praying until they arrived so I told the brothers my pastor arrived Africa you know that one is my father so I don't want him to work from the airplane to uh foreign [Music] [Music] so they they definitely yes [Applause] [Music] they sent a car there but he said no you must you must then be in that car because we can't allow the car to go there I had to make it as a sign that God is giving us a place when you go to a place just thank you foreign [Music] um a gift operates by a true happiness so it means if you want the gift to operate you must make the person happy that's why the prophet says we'll make the gifts and I think many people getting Among Us don't pick that chance that a gift does not just do Miracles who makes the gifts because it's like the pastors for the introductions [Music] and when I was waiting the thank you multiple videos the manifestation of the spirit ual prophesying and I knew that I don't want to take too much [Music] we need really to appreciate [Music] the man God has given unto us yes [Music] the blessings to Jesus and that makes the ministry of Jesus [Music] if you start doubting and fighting foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I don't know foreign [Laughter] [Music] okay yes I am representing the the premiers of the church the elders chicken board and the trustee board in that case that includes the church as the whole so I'm speaking on behalf of the church when problemacetic sent me a message this morning said you're going to speak on behalf of the elders now to speak about the pastor it's a very it's a challenge yeah I can't speak about the pasta on my personal capacity how I know him when did I know him how he groomed me now that will be a personal one but now if I have to speak on behalf of the church I just decided to the only person that knows the pastor is God or he himself must come and speak about him so then God sent me to brother Brandon and said no brother Brennan knows him let him go let him come and speak about him brother Brendan said no Paul knows him yeah so I decided no I'm not going to say a thing it's just chocolate brother Branham says and what Paul says that will be the church as Pastor David said some of us are very notorious for the longevity of our speeches but we are we are very long and I don't be surprised by these papers we just want to read what Paul says amen [Applause] start by saying the pasta is a special person now what can you say if they say someone is a special person and who are you to speak on behalf of me now he says he is the highest order of the church remember so my speeches are are always so as the policeman model is along the order side now it says a pastor is a special person uh is the highest order in the church yeah let's order in the church so but you see in the church there is a pastor the pasta is a special person he is built where he can put up with the forces of the people he's a parent there he's an ox of the team he's a man that can sit down when somebody got something against somebody yes and sit down with them too families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he knows how to take care of things now he's describing him not me yeah and now the Church of God is there now and now the Church of God is the highest of judgment remember and the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder meaning the pastor is the highest thing in the apostolic church now those who knows what an Apostolic church is he says he the Elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Ghost I would say holy ghost then comes the past the Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the Elder the Elder give it to the people amen now Paul said now it's all not describing you he said not all things presently and in order remember we said is the highest order in the church First Corinthians chapter 1 14 that's Paul first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12 Paul says and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you mean it means we must know him because he's neighboring among our house who is laboring among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you amen right verse 13 says and to esteem them very highly in the love for their word and be at peace among yourselves yes it's Paul again in the book of Hebrews he says remember them which have they rule over you remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto the who has who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation verse 17 says obey them not have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for you for the word for you so yes now woman who am I that I can speak about somebody that watch for myself as they have a day that must give account amen and that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you that's what Pastor David will say then don't worry it's only three pages and through America [Music] then says I'm doing that so that maybe some of us might remember who we are and who is our pastor the first thing that's foreign I wish to say is that the pastor is always in full charge of the Tabernacle right so he is in full charge to change or to do what so ever I think is best under the leadership of the Holy Ghost yeah now that's what he says be humble don't never get yourself puffed up Pastor David mentioned that pop up to place where you know more about Eastern Europe pasta or the church that you are worshiping in yes if you get to that place then I will advise each one of you to get another place to worship then he continues he says because I am asking the pastor never to permit anything outside of the Bible of the Bible order the way we have seen it here in the church and then we want these gifts that the Pastor David was talking about to be operated and in peace and the worshipers carried correctly according to the word you'll see a mighty wonderful Church in operation for our Lord Jesus Christ amen that's exactly that was happened that has happened in the Jamaican amen he also has the right over his dick on board so I'm speaking in from here you can change the tick on board the trustees or the pianists or any other office in the church that you decide to change feeling led by the Holy Spirit to do so amen it is abide in the doctrine of their Church it is lawful for them to add or to take away of the teachings because they are owned sorry yes that's right is it lawful for them to add or to take away of their teachings because of their own personal opinion or Revelation that is an answer translate should be perfectly in harmony with the doctrine of their Church they should stay perfectly with the interpretation of the scriptures of their church because if they don't they are fighting against their very thing they are hurting themselves that's the last picture I told you that my speech is on the order this idea and then when they remember the side maybe some have just lost their position so there's nothing that I can see about the pastor or just read what brother Branham says about the pastor and his authority he says you've got to have faith in him and confidence in faith and confidence in him that's the reason your pastor can't do nothing for you you've got to have faith in him and confidence in him as a man of God then he says You must be soldiers not fresh recruits your age soldiers now and been trained to fight that's what he has done he's trained us to fight amen and Satan will come among you because you uh cause you to dispute with one another if he can turn him down just immediately your brethren is the enemy yes and you're here to hold a standard in the evening light because when the world is darkened and the whole church kingdom is going into the Council of churches let me not go into that one you see that's the last one yeah and stay with your mother so he's the shepherd and you give him respect he will lead you because his ordained of God to do so [Music] he will take you the rest of the way through the sentences amen carried you safely is far with God he will take you the rest of the world if he has taken you this far then he will take you through [Music] um yeah yeah that was my speech [Applause] Hallelujah see that's why God bless you amen [Music] before we call the pasta to give Thanksgiving I'm told the pastor is also going to unveil another surprise for us [Music] and after the speech of the pastor I will unveil another event so today we have many surprises so before we can call the pastor to come through I'm going to call two musical items in preparation for the pasta to come the reason I'm gonna do that [Music] is because I'm told that there are people that brought presents so I'm gonna ask them to put them on that table over there after the pastor has spoken then we're going to have a presentation of the gift so I will ask sister maseti and sister kanisile to render an item before we call the pastor so if you left them present in the car just be kind to bring it there before the pasta can give a Thanksgiving message sister livo if God has placed something in your heart just be a lady God bless you Sister my city then ask the assistant can you see them [Music] all the days of my life I shine no oh all the days I shall know all the days of my life shine oh baby foreign [Music] [Music] toward us yes [Music] and I said sure [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] where to say see myself funny [Music] I need [Music] them [Music] so please [Music] [Applause] oh yeah [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I love you today [Music] almost [Music] [Music] come on [Music] it is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] baby [Music] [Music] oh no no no no no no no no no no no [Music] no no no no no no no no no [Music] no foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but yeah [Music] for me [Music] I know not why this sovereignty but leave his throne today [Music] he left his voice I don't know all I know is that it did just for you and me here I am good love you free money [Music] flows for me so many times I fall directly I bring my flowers safe by the true place [Music] so red blood [Music] [Music] is [Music] together [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Pastor David said something [Music] also emphasized on that to say we have to make the pasta happy so the family and the elders were reminding me that there is something special to make the person happy so I'm going to ask the pastor to come and stand here and oh they prefer the pastor to stand on my right and there is a special gift that the pastor is going to receive from our elderly and thereafter I would also just ask Pastor kuchingari is a special gift for you amen still have more gifts but they will have us so we just want to make money do you know a song that means the pasta heavy can you sing that song [Music] so yeah oh yes yes yeah [Music] the song that is recommended Villa will sing that song uh when they handed it a special gift to the pastor camera people just make sure that the description when I post truly remember hey is the Big Stone along a tree that's windy always this traveled well is [Music] [Music] Joy Joy thank you [Music] this day [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning [Music] unless I say God bless you brother first of all I was very thankful that I could be here for your birthday these gifts I could have just set them out but you wouldn't understand what they were about because part of what I brought I wanted to represent where I live so I had to bring certain things with me and put it together when I got here so I'll have to explain what it is okay uh and what whenever I talk to brother Matthew I think it was in May uh I told him that I wanted to come in August and he said well he said okay we'll look for you August the 3rd so I thought okay well I've already got a time to start with and then he said it would be nice if you could stay through Saturday the 12th because it's our pastor's birthday so I said fine I'll make my return right after that so um so what I did was I have some things here that I put together I'll mention to you that when I came to the airport uh I was greeted very nicely and a little sister by the name of little Tina is it Go Tina okay I'm sorry I get the name kind of yeah so anyway she gave me the little book of poems that she had and I have been reading through those since I've been here I have a little bit farther to go but when I left my home I got more of what I needed than just to make one so I actually made two and I have one of them in this bag here and whenever you get a chance you can give it to her I don't know if she's here or not but I wanted to see that she gets it and I'm going to kind of explain what it is uh as I present this to you I've got a couple things in this bag so I'm going to give you one thing that's totally unrelated to at first and then I have another item that I'll give it to you afterwards that's what's in this blue package here okay so um besides the card I got you which you can read when you get a chance this is this is probably this is probably something that I don't know if you'll have a lot of use for these uh we use them in the U.S all the time uh but but you can open it it's not really wrapped in gift paper but go ahead and if you want to just unwrap the paper off of it and you'll see whether I can unwrap it for you yeah chill open enough to show you what it is what those are is those are our coasters that you can set a glass on okay and I notice here in this country you don't use a lot of ice you don't use any eyes actually most of the time but we use ice generally for our drinks so if you have a drink with ice in it and you're setting on a glass table then you get water all over the table and everything and sometimes if we have a hot coffee or something we'll set it [Applause] [Music] and I thought about you because you're always talking about the lighthouse about the light and how there's two different lights that's not the main thing but that's one of the things foreign I'm going to try to keep it intact okay and I'm going to set it I'm going to set it right here and then I will go into it in more detail okay so what I did was let me see if I can get this here [Music] what I did was I thought what can I bring I'm sorry I thought what can what can I bring that will be represented of my area that I live in so I thought well we have we have some of the whitest beaches around where are there there are some places where you'll find white sand but not very many but the area in which I live has very white sand and so I got some white sand I got more than I needed I didn't know why I was bringing so much more than I needed but now I do because I made two I got some white sand and then I got some little shells that are kind of like little clam shells here those wash up on the shore so they're they're usually we don't dig for these little things here they just sort of wash it but those are little shells we would find on our shore and then the other thing I got is a sand dollar and I don't know if you've ever seen a sand dollar before can you hold this with you [Music] some people might be familiar with this it's called a sand dollar and they're located in different places uh different areas where they have emotions sometimes they'll have sand dollars you don't usually see these on the beach until they washed up on the beach okay they've either they're a living organism but if they die then they wash up they're on they're on the on the sand or whatever and then the sun bleaches them out and that's why they look quite like this okay well there's a little legend about this and that is that the sand dollar depicts the life and death of Jesus Christ in it because let me let me get this right here I will read it to you and then you can look at this and and see it maybe like hold on so in the sand dollar uh it's I'm going to read this it says the legend Grand is told about the life of Jesus throughout this odd shaped seashell if you view it from the top as seen above right here if you do it from the top the center plainly shows The Guiding star that led the wise men to Bethlehem and that's right in the very center so you have to sometimes you have to look pretty close to see it okay uh and also on the top is the Easter lily so the there's there's five little projections here that look just like an Easter Lily and an Easter lily I got I got a picture of one there's a little streak up through the middle of it and then there's like leaves on either side of it so it's got three three areas in it and this this little um this little uh sand dollar has that on it okay the other thing of the sand dollar is they say it depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ because you have two Nails where the nailed in his hands to the Cross down here you have two Nails where they nailed his feet to the cross and right in the middle is the spear that they appears to side with when he died and so that's why they say that's what those little holes represent on the back side of this it's also depicting a plant and it's called a poinsettia we see poinsettias in our country usually around Christmas time so it's generally a time when everybody acknowledges the birth of Jesus and so forth we know that he wasn't born in the winter if it was winter time or whatever but anyway that's what's on the back so all those things are on this little sand dollar now when I was getting ready to put these together because I was going to make two of them I had this right here in a package with one sandal and there was a little clear package and then I got another sand dollar that was the same size thinking I was going to put that one in your jar and then give you this in a package the one I decided to do two I took the sand dollar out of this put it in your jar and I put the other one in herger okay now uh one thing a video since I only had one of these I knew I was going to have to reproduce and make two because I wanted one for the other one so I thought okay I need to find a place where I can have this copied so I went to a place called PostNet which is where they do that sort of thing and I took this in now I want to ask you what color if you're looking at that can anybody tell me what color that looks like can you tell me what color would you say that is I mean is it a green I'm flying color yeah I'm color blind blue green can we get a good look at it okay magenta green but this but it seems to me it's almost like a blue green I would think because you're seeing the color on it it's a green but it's kind of like a blue green so I took it in and uh to have it copied and when they copied it it came out like this in the copy machine okay it came out like that that color of green now that's very significant here because that color would be more like an emerald color wouldn't you say more of a green that would look like kind of like an emerald the place where I live on along that Coast right in that area is called the Emerald Coast so that the camera of course is a green color and the reason that they call it the Emerald Coast is the water stair or the same color as that dream so when I had it reproduced it came out with this color green that represents the waters that these things would be in so I copied it off and I put one in each jar one layers and one so I just want you know it's not uh it's nothing flashy but it's something that just represents I wanted to bring that to you the other item I have here let me put this in the back here's a card here too but I'll just let you open the card later okay I'll just save the card there um this item here now let me say something about this this is something that this is something that I was given by another brother to bring here uh to show you okay and uh he was very generous so let me do that and he said now after I started on my trip he said I want you to have the power to give that as a gift if you wish to do it and he said you can say that's between you and me from you and me this brother's name is Bruce Haskins and I fellowship with him quite often he's a brother that I happen to love very much and uh so he gave me this to bring so I am giving this to you um I need something to cut the tape I put tape on the end so I'll help to open it just anything it doesn't have to be real sharp because I need to open it up and show it to you um let me know I thought this might be the only one of these in South Africa but I found out I was wrong let me see if I can get it out of here this is the original 1963 copy of when the prophet makes it the cloud you don't remember the company well this brother and his brother had this magazine I never had even seen it I heard about it and I saw the cover at one time somewhere I had never even read the the article in it but I read it on this trip okay so uh it depicts the times there's a lot in there that's probably undesirable to look at but um but it does show the cloud and it shows on the other side of the page they called it a moon moon beam it's a rainbow I think it is you may know this I don't know if you've ever seen this or not but I found out that brother uh is it to ship to shampoo okay okay he had come to find out as I was talking to the jfm oh I guess I'm not bringing the only one apparently he went to a meeting somewhere or put to some place wherever you had meetings and a brother there he was looking at that and he admired that you know that that he had that copy and he said we even had taken so apparently he has this copy here I didn't know that I mean because because most people in the US don't have this coffee I didn't have it and this one brother had it so I just want you know we just wanted to give that to you oh my you know just as a coffee because the profit mentions this and it's just representative what he thought thank you I've been a real honor to be able to not only know you but to also be able to be part of this ministry and streaming it's been very very much a blessing to myself and also brother Brothers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] um [Music] God bless you sense I didn't know that the gifts giving of this this elaborate otherwise I don't that much something much better than what I've done um okay well one day I don't know whether it's a year yeah it should be last year um I was passing through the much so I saw something there no I should buy that thing but I should go to apply for the pasta so on this trip I never prepared actually I was sending message on Monday but on Sunday or Monday over the weekend yeah I should come here uh I haven't I hadn't been home at all so I was required to come back to come here so that means that I didn't have time to prepare I wish they told me I have to beat the boss that I'll be here so maybe end up taking something from the Exotic lands to come with it but unfortunately I didn't know so when I was called that because I was empty-handed but when I came back I came here I said no one day I saw something which I said ah this one I want to get for my pastor so today I went and ran and uh to get it so that I can give it to my pastor but it is something which I thought long time ago that uh one day I'll buy this thing for my pasta Mommy [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] there's something which we do a lot with my master and that's a drinking tea we drink a lot of tea [Music] and coffee yeah so now um [Music] but they say this one can keep your tea warm for 24 hours [Applause] you can make your tea here and you can drink until the next day yes [Music] I wish I love them that are the thing I knew that their business would be this [Music] all right so yes I'm continuing we as the board and we're scheduled yes [Music] thank you love it I mean so um I was saying pastor that is the our team seeing a new schedule how the demand is we've realized that you would like to pack your things in order [Music] remain behind yes so we thought of getting something that you can if when you fly they can put it in the cabin so that your spoken whether those are to you if you think of something I thought you can just say myself to bring me that spoken word I want to check something so it's just a a truly travel deck type that you can use handy and it's also got what you call the thing that you pull out and you can also use that because you know when you travel long distances there's things like jet lag and all those things so if you feel cramps you can lean on it as you travel so this is the thing the story that we have come on baby [Applause] [Music] you [Music] you want two gifts it's a special one that is so I think that one if I'm right person is for the pastor so we I think there's going to be an exchange you know when you travel you find adapters that says from U.S to South Africa another one that says from South Africa to us so there's going to be an exchange from the pasta too that we gave you sent to your visiting [Applause] God bless you yeah we want to give you an opportunity to say a few words and after there will be more presentations of the gifts God bless you Pastor amen amen [Applause] okay you know just to interpret what the past I say amen foreign [Laughter] thank you for saying few words because you know that problem of my own performing yeah so yeah as I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ need to have my pastas with me and speeches they gave indeed feelings so wonderful you know that's why I and [Music] um [Music] all right I'm glad that I I don't see death day because people that are going in there Karma today and Rapture is another Federation because
