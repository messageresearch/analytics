[1:28:39] that is our Lord Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ not brother
[1:28:46] as you think
[1:28:49] okay I mean all right now
[1:28:54] we are going to
[1:28:56] we have something here too
[1:29:02] I don't are you ready for that yes oh
[1:29:06] yes
[1:29:08] um
[1:29:09] you know I am still there that's why you
[1:29:11] say I I I'm looking yes
[1:29:18] the
[1:29:19] but the first thing that represented
[1:29:22] that Redemption is
[1:29:35] because even this message
[1:29:37] is from the back side
[1:29:41] of the book
[1:29:44] so and then uh he took the book
[1:29:48] achiabuka
[1:29:51] let us
[1:29:53] put it first then
[1:29:56] yes my brother so we are
[1:30:01] is God
[1:30:03] to make things easier for us
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:11] oh yeah brother just point to the first
[1:30:14] part the
[1:30:17] yeah I will read I will read this part
[1:30:20] just
[1:30:21] I think
[1:30:23] yeah
[1:30:25] I wanna can you see it
[1:30:28] the first thing we presented that the
[1:30:32] Redemption
[1:30:34] that represented it since cbse image
[1:30:39] come the lamp that had been slain from
[1:30:42] the foundation of the world
[1:30:45] all of us that's the plan of God
[1:30:52] from before the foundation of the world
[1:30:56] of us
[1:30:58] foreign
[1:31:24] that's why the Angels
[1:31:27] stop everything is
[1:31:33] the service
[1:31:35] was coming down services
[1:31:38] I mean
[1:31:40] to men if that's why we read the
[1:31:44] scripture what is men
[1:31:50] yes
[1:31:55] in the book we read
[1:31:58] there was no man who was named
[1:32:02] to till the ground
[1:32:07] that is Genesis chapter
[1:32:11] one
[1:32:13] there you are there was no man who was
[1:32:16] named to till
[1:32:19] meaning that in the program of God
[1:32:24] in the program of God
[1:32:28] there must be
[1:32:30] foreign
[1:32:48] now I was not surprised
[1:32:50] when things were sent to the Earth to
[1:32:57] to that demand oh
[1:33:05] all right
[1:33:09] then it says
[1:33:18] I will start from here and tour of the
[1:33:22] sealsuto and sent it down to The Air I
[1:33:26] remember
[1:33:27] now actually we are where is our church
[1:33:33] where is our child Brew here it is
[1:33:42] that's right I mean and
[1:33:46] but if you look at it leveling
[1:33:49] how it operates on
[1:33:53] from Heaven
[1:33:56] downwards
[1:33:58] then it puts you in the threefold your
[1:34:02] local
[1:34:06] this is what I'm looking at here yes but
[1:34:10] to the seventh angels
[1:34:14] to reveal it to his people
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:20] if there is a major style
[1:34:24] food and
[1:34:27] and it brings forth its light it relates
[1:34:32] to the cluster
[1:34:37] that's right I mean the Stars around the
[1:34:41] United States
[1:34:45] now you must make sure because from like
[1:34:48] Paul was that style
[1:34:54] the first church cluster there
[1:34:59] the main star was
[1:35:02] available
[1:35:06] all right I mean
[1:35:09] as it's something to do with us
[1:35:12] yes they just want me to
[1:35:15] me too all right all right yeah
[1:35:18] okay
[1:35:20] have you seen that Labon
[1:35:23] every pasta
[1:35:25] is a star yes
[1:35:31] and the cluster is receiving from the
[1:35:34] main stars
[1:35:41] uh
[1:35:43] my brother here last night
[1:35:48] because we we don't sleep we are waiting
[1:35:51] for the Lord
[1:35:54] I mean I mean he said something to me um
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:03] like how can I be
[1:36:06] like you or foreign
[1:36:16] well okay I mean
[1:36:19] then we we we I went on to say
[1:36:23] that's why if
[1:36:25] you are there when Paul was here
[1:36:30] you just be like a Paul oh no
[1:36:36] because God Paul is the light there
[1:36:42] and this little stars around
[1:36:47] you know they are receiving their light
[1:36:50] from the main light yeah
[1:36:55] amen amen so they are just going to
[1:36:59] testify to their people
[1:37:01] about what they have received from the
[1:37:04] ministers
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:11] so they are just like that main star do
[1:37:14] not finally
[1:37:15] all right so make sure
[1:37:18] perceiving your light from the light
[1:37:24] it is light from the light yes
[1:37:29] okay and that's why he says he he is
[1:37:35] and he said that the light said
[1:37:40] to us
[1:37:45] foreign
[1:38:15] amen amen so that's how it is
[1:38:21] and they and brother gave us a testimony
[1:38:25] or for a sister
[1:38:29] we are maybe he will give it to us
[1:38:32] actually
[1:38:37] maybe there's something you have missed
[1:38:42] when the testimony was coming forth of
[1:38:46] that child
[1:38:50] in hospital
[1:38:53] and
[1:38:55] you know brother
[1:38:59] music
[1:39:02] said something
[1:39:04] that there is a man
[1:39:08] who said worrying
[1:39:13] I should go and get that
[1:39:17] Sun boy where he is
[1:39:22] I I don't know if
[1:39:25] I'm reflecting very well yes
[1:39:29] did you say that brother

[1:58:30] tell him
[1:58:34] I your father none that I've sent you

[1:59:00] and he will make sure that alternative
[1:59:04] he's gonna tell Mr Soso exactly what the
[1:59:09] father has
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:20] if you hear the word of God like
[1:59:26] foreign
[1:59:34] there is some
[1:59:37] other people or so forth available
[1:59:41] meaning but I'm not talking about the
[1:59:44] people
[1:59:44] and who will come and say uh
[1:59:50] that man that Prophet is
[1:59:55] this and this and this yeah
[1:59:59] if I am predestinated
[2:00:03] I have already heard God
[2:00:10] has already told me he will send me
[2:00:13] Elijah
[2:00:15] any other thing coming after that
[2:00:22] for me okay I have already
[2:00:27] God has already spoken if somebody comes
[2:00:32] after them
[2:00:38] I mean I'm in I mean
[2:00:41] you know that yes sir
[2:00:44] Moses Moshe God gives him the words
[2:00:51] uh take them acrossidi
[2:00:56] and yes
[2:00:59] whether they see is contrary or whatever
[2:01:05] God reminds Moses
[2:01:08] tell the people to go forward
[2:01:11] meaning God has spoken
[2:01:16] has listened to God
[2:01:18] now if you are a Believer you know that
[2:01:22] the sea has believed
[2:01:43] amen all right amen no
[2:01:47] if God puts you on a path
[2:01:50] that part is
[2:01:57] a Believer
[2:01:59] because he can say the word of God and
[2:02:03] he became the garden of Egypt
[2:02:07] so everything that God
[2:02:10] foreign
[2:02:38] that's why now
[2:02:48] it's a wave
[2:02:50] you know I always I carry around with me
[2:02:54] that way
[2:03:00] and I say you are true God
[2:03:03] although there are things coming from
[2:03:06] Elizabeth
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:17] God said
[2:03:24] so Joshua must take the word of God
[2:03:27] and carry on actually Pete amen amen
[2:03:31] because the weight said
[2:03:36] you believe God
[2:03:38] he says
[2:03:47] all right okay let's let's look at this
[2:03:50] Army I'm saying something here
[2:03:53] uh now he sent it to his servant I
[2:03:57] remember
[2:04:03] to reveal it to his people
[2:04:11] you know that's why
[2:04:16] the Sea Lord believed Moses amen
[2:04:23] amen amen if God says
[2:04:26] Amen to you
[2:04:30] like God sent Moses to the Sea family
[2:04:35] the first thing is
[2:04:38] to convince the sin
[2:04:46] my Prophet is coming this way
[2:04:55] and the Sea saw them
[2:05:02] Jordan the sea they were convicted
[2:05:09] yeah they were converted
[2:05:13] God has spoken to the seeds
[2:05:21] when Moses comes so the sea was waiting
[2:05:25] for Moses
[2:05:29] amen
[2:05:31] for God has spoken to Jesus
[2:05:36] don't worry the path that is
[2:05:46] always when you do things
[2:05:52] when I was attacked I'm not talking
[2:05:55] about that
[2:05:57] to me
[2:05:59] when I was attacked
[2:06:02] and then I said to myself
[2:06:05] people with guns
[2:06:12] has never told us
[2:06:15] I will go this way out
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:21] so amidst all that
[2:06:24] I remain calm
[2:06:27] because knowing that it's about God has
[2:06:30] never told me
[2:06:32] that I will go this way
[2:06:35] all right I mean if God tells you he
[2:06:39] will take you up in the Rapture
[2:06:42] he will tell you
[2:06:46] amen if you are going in the Rapture you
[2:06:48] will know him
[2:06:50] that's why he said that day you shall
[2:06:55] the people that are going in there
[2:07:38] we know the promise
[2:07:42] foreign
[2:08:09] foreign
[2:08:14] I'm in
[2:08:17] shall I reach
[2:08:20] now he sent down to the Earth to his
[2:08:25] seven well I remember
[2:08:29] to reveal it to his
[2:08:36] if you are also of God oh
[2:08:44] [Music]
[2:08:47] to his
[2:08:50] people people
[2:08:56] Revelation could
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] if
[2:09:03] maybe he has said it in this way aroma
[2:09:10] to talk to his people
[2:09:12] but it's not to talk to his people
[2:09:16] to reveala
[2:09:19] to his people to reveal is to make known
[2:09:27] to his people
[2:09:30] but you know there's something like this
[2:09:32] is
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:39] there was one subject
[2:09:42] that really gave me headaches
[2:09:48] once the teacher can say
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:51] today is
[2:09:56] very something in me would say run away
[2:10:03] knowing that I'm not that material oh

[2:40:28] day
[2:40:32] when he arrives at the men yeah
[2:40:38] what did he do he stopped I am
[2:40:43] when he arrived at the seventh here
[2:40:49] when it arrived there even the angels
[2:40:53] stopped I am
[2:40:58] why
[2:41:00] it arrives
[2:41:03] yes I say the Bible says Bible here
[2:41:08] there was no man who was numbered to
[2:41:12] till
[2:41:13] [Music]
[2:41:15] meaning they were supposed to be a man
[2:41:22] all right I mean there was no man who
[2:41:25] was number to open their seals
[2:41:29] it was supposed to be amen amen
[2:41:35] Adam Adam was the god of the Earth
[2:41:40] and God the god of the universe
[2:41:51] God send
[2:41:54] to Adam
[2:41:58] things pertaining pertaining to the
[2:42:01] things below the Earth
[2:42:04] sent things to the Earth
[2:42:08] then he is God respected the god of the
[2:42:11] earth amen
[2:42:16] he never even said to Adam
[2:42:20] this one is
[2:42:24] in respect of the god of the earth
[2:42:28] he he brings it to Adam
[2:42:31] for Adam or Adam to see what Adam would
[2:42:36] say
[2:42:37] if Adam say well this one is alive
[2:42:43] the god of the universe
[2:42:48] amen amen it is within your powers
[2:42:53] I mean
[2:42:55] so that's how he did it
[2:42:58] that's why even today
[2:43:03] before it can work for me
[2:43:06] it has to come to the seventh Engineers
[2:43:12] all right if it can work
[2:43:16] for the seventh engine message
[2:43:21] it will work late night time he's a
[2:43:25] human being I am a human
[2:43:30] but God has to put it to test first
[2:43:37] he has made this man a prophet
[2:43:42] a prophet means it is God formed in the
[2:43:47] form of a man
[2:43:50] it is God in the form of a man
[2:43:54] now if it comes to this woman
[2:43:58] so it will pass on to me
[2:44:03] amen I mean or you can say I am I I am
[2:44:08] blessed
[2:44:10] because
[2:44:12] God likened me unto the seventh angel
[2:44:15] message
[2:44:22] was actually sent to me
[2:44:25] that's why he says
[2:44:33] so shall I be with you
[2:44:36] and brother says and the people also
[2:44:41] said
[2:44:42] we shall only here
[2:44:46] is
[2:44:49] he was with Moses
[2:44:53] [Applause]
[2:44:54] amen amen even today we are saying the
[2:44:58] same thing
[2:44:59] yeah pastor muruti we will hear you
[2:45:03] only is
[2:45:05] God is with you as he was with Moses
[2:45:12] yes that's right amen
[2:45:16] that's why
[2:45:21] would be a soul with him
[2:45:27] he won't see anything unless
[2:45:34] he visits first
[2:45:37] before I say something
[2:45:40] I check with brother
[2:45:42] brother
[2:45:44] what do you say what what did God
[2:45:48] says
[2:45:55] but I come I come after that
[2:46:00] God shall do nothing
[2:46:05] he reveals To His prophets
[2:46:09] that's why I take it from the prophets
[2:46:14] oh God how do I know he is God's Prophet
[2:46:18] it is because of the nature
[2:46:21] the divine nature that is
[2:46:30] all right I mean
[2:46:39] the reason I left the message
[2:46:44] amen amen
[2:46:47] when I remember what the Lord has done
[2:46:50] I will never
[2:46:53] go back

[2:48:48] the church is revealed
[2:48:55] right I mean and
[2:48:59] we don't form a church our family in
[2:49:03] opposition to somebody
[2:49:10] it's himself who builds his church
[2:49:13] [Music]
[2:49:16] you know sometimes we say
[2:49:18] yeah I will start another movement
[2:49:25] in opposition to this world
[2:49:30] all right yeah like a brother who said
[2:49:34] now we have a church
[2:49:39] when a brother was ordained
[2:49:44] now with this brother
[2:50:04] we have a church
[2:50:08] all right
[2:50:10] but I was glad that you look at times
[2:50:13] the Lord Jesus said I
[2:50:21] [Music]
[2:50:23] Upon This Rock
[2:50:27] and the gates of Freddy's
[2:50:34] amen amen don't become a church in
[2:50:37] Pretoria
[2:50:39] you are a member of this body
[2:50:41] [Music]
[2:50:44] a church born of God
[2:50:47] not in Pretoria but in Christ
[2:50:53] because if you become a church
[2:50:56] then next time
[2:50:59] you'll be fighting a church in whatever
[2:51:02] somewhere else
[2:51:06] that's why I told them in my life
[2:51:09] churches in the message
[2:51:16] and we don't have the bride of Christ
[2:51:22] [Music]
[2:51:24] the bride of Christ
[2:51:29] is that right
[2:51:31] if I meet
[2:51:34] a brother
[2:51:38] memes memes yes it means his way in

[2:51:49] the bright Church
[2:52:00] we will meet
[2:52:02] I know him I'll meet him
[2:52:05] so when we meet we will meet here in
[2:52:09] Christ then you will realize that
[2:52:12] we have known one another
[2:52:15] before the foundation
[2:52:18] one of us
[2:52:31] my books are you know books
[2:52:35] my books are books
[2:52:37] yeah let me read you something here
[2:52:41] where's my book brother

[2:53:51] right I mean if you go back here well

[2:54:00] free food
[2:54:04] logos logos
[2:54:10] foreign
[2:54:18] remote
[2:54:26] if God says something it will reflected
[2:54:30] in this three forms
[2:54:38] I am in my father and you and ye in me
[2:54:42] and I am I in you in you and when the
[2:54:45] word of God comes it comes later in
[2:54:49] these three forms so because the church
[2:54:52] here is part of the threefolds
[2:54:56] the bride of Christ part of the
[2:54:59] threefolds
[2:55:09] the father
