[0:23] [Music]
[0:32] Amen.
[0:33] Christ is the anointing.
[0:39] Now, son of man,
[0:44] the son of man back in the church again
[0:47] revealed in human beings,
[0:51] not son of god,
[0:54] but son of man
[0:57] again
[0:58] back in the church.
[1:02] Let me read it again in this place here.
[1:06] some of men back where
[1:10] amen for uh for for for now I read it
[1:14] here page nine
[1:17] then we find after his death burial and
[1:19] resurrection
[1:21] he came on the day of Pentecost
[1:25] son of God
[1:29] before that he was son of men
[1:34] then he came As after after
[1:37] resurrection,
[1:38] he came on the day of Pentecost.
[1:41] He started to be son of man on the day
[1:43] of Pentecost.
[1:46] Before Pentecost, he was son of man.
[1:50] Son of God before Pentecost. Before
[1:53] Pentecost,
[1:55] you are son of God. I I mean son of man.
[1:58] Sorry. Forgive me. But from the day of
[2:02] Pentecost
[2:04] on the day of Pentecost,
[2:06] the Holy Ghost came then he was
[2:09] introduced as sons.
[2:15] Right?
[2:17] Son of God, the Holy Ghost.
[2:21] Now the seven church ages
[2:24] is the work of the Holy Ghost.
[2:28] The prophet tells you
[2:30] The Holy Ghost started the Ephesians
[2:32] church age
[2:34] all the church ages.
[2:37] That's why you have here the holy
[2:41] because this is the work of the Holy
[2:43] Ghost.
[2:46] But the Holy Ghost
[2:49] the Bible says was a teacher.
[2:54] And when
[2:57] the teacher
[3:01] uh h has completed
[3:05] uh has brought a student
[3:10] uh to I'll say majority
[3:14] then he will introduce
[3:17] the people the the the student
[3:21] to the master
[3:23] and say I have done my work
[3:26] here's your
[3:29] Amen. Now, seven church ages,
[3:33] the prophet says you find twins,
[3:38] Isaac and Ishma. Isaac and
[3:42] Jacob and Esau. Jacob is
[3:45] somebody said, you know, Jacob is a
[3:48] suppler
[3:50] and so forth. Then I said, now if you
[3:54] pointed Jacob like this,
[3:57] and you say you are a suppler.
[4:00] God said I love Jacob. I hate Esau.
[4:05] Now this finger points at you as Esau.
[4:13] Right? God said I love Jacob.
[4:20] I don't like Esau. And Esau said you are
[4:25] a suppler. you
[4:28] and God said, "I hate you."
[4:34] Now,
[4:36] twins, twins, twins, twins, twins
[4:39] until the seventh church age.
[4:43] Now, we are not
[4:46] in Laian church age.
[4:51] The Holy Ghost has done its work.
[4:54] That's why in each and every age
[4:58] you hear
[5:02] a saying
[5:04] the he who has an ear, let him hear what
[5:08] the spirit says today.
[5:12] You have seven times
[5:17] admonition. Amen. You hear it here. He
[5:22] who has an ear, let him hear what the
[5:25] spirit says today
[5:28] until the loudian.
[5:32] Now since we are not in Ludishia now
[5:36] which is people people's rights
[5:41] means people's rights that's why you see
[5:44] people are coming with rice rights.
[5:49] I've got the right to do I've got
[5:53] And it's been sanctioned
[5:56] by the governments.
[5:58] Even the children now they've got
[6:01] rights.
[6:04] He absolutely
[6:07] says
[6:12] right right because it's
[6:17] the people's rights. And the Bible says
[6:20] come out of it.
[6:24] [Music]
[6:25] Then don't don't touch their things.
[6:29] Amen. And now the church of God
[6:33] is not in laudician condition
[6:37] of people's rights and what rights and
[6:39] so forth.
[6:40] I tell my children you don't have any
[6:42] rights.
[6:45] Your rights is god godly rights.
[6:50] and godly rights. You shall honor your
[6:52] parents
[6:56] and remember your creator
[7:00] in the days of your youth.
[7:03] That's godly rights.
[7:06] Now lishia means that people's rights.
[7:11] I understand that we are heading for
[7:14] year
[7:16] 2010
[7:21] and my minister comes and say
[7:27] prostitution and these other things
[7:32] they should be
[7:35] legalized.
[7:39] Brothers don't read these things. Let me
[7:43] they they should legalize these things.
[7:48] Now a prostitution a prostitute
[7:51] she's going to boast of rise.
[7:56] She can stand there naked
[7:59] and you come and say, "Hey, hey, you met
[8:02] my right."
[8:06] That's Laudishia,
[8:08] people's rights. They only want
[8:12] a minister to sanction that
[8:18] 1910
[8:19] you'll see things
[8:22] 2010 you you'll see things
[8:25] uh because there's some people coming
[8:27] from overseas
[8:30] now they want pleasure.
[8:34] So it's you see now
[8:37] it's football
[8:40] plus
[8:43] around that.
[8:46] I'm glad I'm a child of God.
[8:51] Amen.
[8:53] And
[8:55] they are going to sweep
[9:01] balloons all around the stadium.
[9:12] singing.
[9:14] Condromise. Condromise. Condromise.
[9:19] I'm glad you are quiet now. Yes,
[9:22] you have seven.
[9:26] All right.
[9:27] Now throughout the seven church ages
[9:31] like this,
[9:35] he is the son of
[9:41] son of God
[9:45] throughout the seven church ages.
[9:48] He is not the son of man, the son of
[9:51] God. But Luke 17:30 says 17:30 as it was
[9:59] he shall come again
[10:02] he will he will change his position
[10:06] and when the son of man
[10:10] is revealed
[10:13] again
[10:15] oh my time won't allow me now
[10:19] son of God
[10:22] in our day.
[10:24] Now you are looking for Jesus in a
[10:27] corporal body.
[10:31] Who is this son of God?
[10:34] The son of God in a man.
[10:38] Amen. He will do the same things.
[10:45] And those who knew him
[10:49] will recognize
[10:51] that it's him again.
[10:58] Amen. God
[11:00] is a spirit
[11:03] and those who knew him.
[11:06] Those who were in him
[11:09] when he changed his mask
[11:14] and God was in Jesus
[11:16] to reconcile the world unto him.
[11:19] Those who were in him in spirit,
[11:22] they came around Jesus
[11:25] knowing that that God
[11:29] behind this king.
[11:34] All right. Amen. Now those who knew the
[11:37] Lord Jesus Christ
[11:41] when the third pool
[11:45] they could they knew
[11:48] that Malach
[11:51] Jesus
[11:52] but how he came
[11:55] he was in a man
[11:59] amen
[12:01] to show the pro I won't read these
[12:03] things the prophet says
[12:05] When the was in Moses, Moses was
[12:12] Amen. So while they were looking up
[12:14] praying,
[12:17] Moses was busy calling, "Follow me.
[12:19] Come,
[12:21] [Music]
[12:24] we would find somebody."
[12:29] He would say, "Hey brother,
[12:31] follow me.
[12:35] Amen. Amen.
[12:38] Because the answer was not there.
[12:45] You see?
[12:48] So
[12:50] today
[12:52] it's going to be it's hard for the
[12:53] people.
[12:58] He was a son of God.
[13:02] Changing himself.
[13:04] That's why we are also changing.
[13:09] Changing himself make himself known to
[13:11] his people
[13:14] in to deal through in a different form
[13:19] like the Holy Spirit. Like the Holy
[13:22] Spirit which is God. He came to deal
[13:25] through the church ages.
[13:28] Amen. He came to deal through the church
[13:31] ages
[13:33] the son of God
[13:36] through the
[13:40] Amen.
[13:42] the Holy Spirit
[13:44] and so forth. Amen. But now
[13:48] h a time factor.
[13:53] Then I read again.
[13:55] Uh he was this the son of man, the son
[13:59] of man is now back in the church again
[14:04] revealed in human beings.
[14:08] Not son of God but the son of man.
[14:13] Now let me tell you now Mark 13 says
[14:19] no man knows that day
[14:23] but the father.
[14:27] Why? Because
[14:29] the mediator
[14:33] when he took the book
[14:36] he left the sanctuary.
[14:40] Yeah. This is one of the mysteries
[14:43] there.
[14:45] He left the sanctuary
[14:48] and was no more a mediator.
[14:54] When he left that place
[14:57] to break the seals.
[15:01] Now he broke the seals
[15:05] and uh gave the book to the seventh
[15:08] angel.
[15:12] and to reveal it to the church.
[15:18] He broke the seal
[15:20] and gave it to Moses
[15:23] to deliver them.
[15:28] Moses, he gave him a stick.
[15:31] The seventh angel messenger, he gave him
[15:33] a sword.
[15:36] Now, that sword was a book.
[15:42] That's why now
[15:45] after here
[15:47] the twins were separated
[15:53] that blast. Now
[15:56] selected the people
[16:00] and the people were selected
[16:04] and the seven separated
[16:10] You get what I mean? So the supernatural
[16:12] blessed when the seals were revealed,
[16:18] it shows now
[16:20] supernatural beings
[16:24] throughout the seven church ages.
[16:26] He says God was selecting his people,
[16:32] the carnal and the spiritual. The canal
[16:34] and the spiritual
[16:38] That's why you get the seals now.
[16:41] He broke the seals.
[16:44] Now you read first seal. A white horse
[16:47] rider.
[16:48] Amen. Up to six.
[16:52] Amen. You get what I mean? Everybody can
[16:55] read that.
[16:57] The white horse and this horse and all
[17:00] those hores and so forth. But you know
[17:04] very well that when the seventh seal
[17:08] that is where the problem is. That is
[17:10] the mystery.
[17:13] The seventh seal
[17:15] is the mystery
[17:18] is the one that opened the seals.
[17:23] You get what I mean? These others you
[17:26] can read
[17:28] this unwritten word.
[17:31] Now the unwritten word can only be
[17:34] kicked by a theophony.
[17:37] [Music]
[17:39] So here you part is this exodus
[17:43] exodus. Amen. We are not talking of now
[17:47] your senses.
[17:50] We are talking about your theophony
[17:54] because the seven the seven angel
[17:56] messenger
[17:58] we see time and eternity there.
[18:02] time shall be no more
[18:06] that it didn't talk speak of the end of
[18:09] the world.
[18:11] Your body is time. My body is time.
[18:16] And all this time
[18:19] we were we followed the prophet reading.
[18:23] We we believe the spoken word, the
[18:24] written word, spoken word, the written
[18:27] word.
[18:29] We believe that the the seventh seal is
[18:31] revealed.
[18:33] But when we were confronted and asked
[18:36] what is the seventh seal,
[18:38] no it's revealed, brother. Yeah. But
[18:41] what is it?
[18:43] Because he said nothing about it.
[18:46] He stopped there. Then would say it's
[18:49] revealed
[18:51] as the predestinated people.
[18:55] Then
[18:57] God took the prophet.
[19:01] He took the prophet away
[19:04] at the right time
[19:07] so that the children should be the
[19:09] grown-ups now.
[19:13] Amen.
[19:15] You know Elisha,
[19:18] he followed. That was time.
[19:21] He followed a prophet. The prophet would
[19:23] say, "Let's go. I'm going there.
[19:26] He would say, I'm going with you.
[19:29] But when they reached Jordan,
[19:32] there was a separation of things.
[19:36] Amen. Amen. So he saw Elijah going up
[19:42] and and he said the wagon of the chariot
[19:45] of Israel.
[19:48] Then what happens?
[19:50] He took off the the the tattered
[19:52] garments.
[19:56] and the mantle of Elijah
[19:59] came upon him.
[20:02] Amen. So he came back
[20:06] with the mantle of Elijah
[20:10] and the people looked at him
[20:13] the spirit of Elijah
[20:15] upon Elijah.
[20:17] [Music]
[20:19] Now this is what should happen now.
[20:24] Right. Amen.
[20:27] The prophet,
[20:29] God took his prophet.
[20:31] What the world is looking for
[20:34] is not the history of the prophet, but
[20:37] is that revelation,
[20:40] not the history about the prophet,
[20:43] the mental of Elijah.
[20:48] Amen. Amen. Elisha coming back.
[20:53] Now the what they saw now was the spirit
[20:55] of God
[20:58] working in Elijah.
[21:03] And some others
[21:06] remained with a history
[21:09] because they saw the prophet
[21:12] passing by.
[21:14] But this one followed the prophet
[21:18] until the spirit that was in the prophet
[21:21] was in him.
[21:25] Not the history, but the spirit that was
[21:28] in Elijah.
[21:30] Now the Lord Jesus said, "The spirit
[21:33] dwelleth with you and shall be
[21:37] in you and you shall become witnesses.
[21:42] A witness has the spirit
[21:45] of Jesus.
[21:48] The spirit of Jesus was in them to
[21:51] witness to.
[21:56] All right. So Elisha could come back and
[21:59] say,
[22:01] you are talking about Elijah.
[22:03] Elijah is here.
[22:08] Amen. Amen.
[22:10] He took the Lord Jesus,
[22:14] but the spirit
[22:17] came back
[22:19] on the day of Pentecost.
[22:22] So they locked themselves in fear of the
[22:25] soldiers.
[22:27] But when that that power
[22:30] indwelt them, they opened the doors.
[22:34] Amen. Amen. And they walked down. And
[22:38] Peter stood there with the the keys of
[22:41] the kingdom.
[22:43] Said, "These men are not drunk with
[22:45] wine,
[22:46] but it's a prophecy being fulfilled.
[22:51] For the Lord said, I shall pour my
[22:53] spirit upon all flesh.
[22:56] This is not the fulfillment."
[23:00] So they feared nothing. They started to
[23:02] preach the kingdom. now
[23:05] even to the soldiers and the people they
[23:08] feared before.
[23:10] Amen. That is the God I worship.
[23:16] So this morning
[23:18] we are under the fatherhood.
[23:23] Oh,
[23:25] the true worshippers this morning shall
[23:28] worship the father
[23:32] after he the the the the intens
[23:37] after the the the
[23:41] mediator
[23:44] left the place.
[23:47] Now we are exposed to the father.
[23:53] He took his position again.
[23:57] And as long as there's no mediator,
[24:02] now we are exposed to the father.
[24:07] That's why now he says, no one will
[24:10] know.
[24:12] Only the father.
[24:14] [Applause]
[24:16] Those who will know are subject to the
[24:19] father.
[24:23] Amen. Amen.
[24:25] Isn't he wonderful?
[24:28] Wonderful. Wonderful. Jesus is to me.
[24:32] Counselor,
[24:35] Prince of PC,
[24:38] saving me, keeping me from all sin and
[24:42] shame.
[24:44] Wonderful.
[24:46] [Music]
[24:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Now,
[24:52] I'm through now.
[24:55] Amen. I'm through now.
[24:59] H But listen to what he says here. This
[25:03] is a great age.
[25:06] Amen. Amen. Now, I wonder if you can
[25:08] keep this
[25:10] until until tonight
[25:13] that we are under
[25:16] the fatherhood.
[25:21] Can can you keep that
[25:27] according to the word
[25:30] according to the spoken word says in
[25:33] this great hour
[25:35] he is revealed again
[25:38] the son of man
[25:42] that's why now
[25:45] the son of man
[25:47] in a man
[25:49] the son of man, a prophet. Christ is an
[25:52] inner man.
[25:56] He opened a book and brought it to the
[26:02] seventh man
[26:04] to He opened it,
[26:08] gave it to the son of
[26:11] seventh angel to reveal it
[26:16] to the
[26:18] He broke it.
[26:20] He just opened it and gave it to a man
[26:24] because the book belonged to Adam.
[26:29] It was supposed
[26:31] to be revealed by a man
[26:34] because man was made the God of the
[26:36] earth.
[26:39] That's why you find the seventh seal.
[26:43] The seventh seal.
[26:45] Amen. Amen. H just give me one minute.
[26:51] the seventh seal.
[26:53] Why it is so
[26:56] it's such a terrible thing the people
[27:00] I'll go back again
[27:02] you have
[27:05] you have six
[27:09] now six is Moses and Elijah
[27:13] the the the angel discovered that
[27:18] seal
[27:19] dealing with nature,
[27:22] the destruction of nature is Moses
[27:26] and Elijah.
[27:28] You read it in the Bible. We don't have
[27:30] time for that. Amen. But you look at the
[27:32] seven.
[27:34] Amen. Now God,
[27:38] if you go this way, I will say God
[27:42] and Adam.
[27:45] Amen. Amen. Now God, he made things one,
[27:49] two, six.
[27:52] And he said there was no man.
[27:58] Why the place was vacancy?
[28:01] Because God
[28:04] now this the seventh day was reserved.
[28:08] God created up to the sixth day.
[28:11] Because the seventh day
[28:14] was reserved
[28:17] for another God here.
[28:20] [Applause]
[28:22] Amen.
[28:23] Let us make man
[28:26] in our image.
[28:28] [Music]
[28:29] So now God
[28:32] reserved that day. On the seventh day he
[28:35] created nothing.
[28:37] And he the Bible says there was no man
[28:42] right. So God reserved the servants
[28:48] for an amateur
[28:52] the God of the earth and the god of
[28:55] heaven.
[28:57] So that's why the prophet tells you Eden
[29:01] was the headquarters of his earth.
[29:05] I mean the garden of Eden
[29:08] was the headquarters
[29:11] of his son.
[29:14] So the book was in the son's hands
[29:18] when he fored it.
[29:22] It went back
[29:24] to the original
[29:26] and the original
[29:29] uh he put it on the throne
[29:33] and he was waiting there
[29:37] while while restoring
[29:40] to bring back men again
[29:44] to give men again the qualifications.
[29:49] And this why we have seven church Jesus
[29:54] time of redemption,
[29:58] worship time.
[30:00] But when we come to the seventh age
[30:02] again,
[30:04] then we see a reproduction of things.
[30:10] So the day was reserved for a minor god.
[30:16] Now that's why he opened the seals
[30:20] and he dropped them back to the seventh
[30:24] angel messenger
[30:26] because now instead of Adam,
[30:30] God had to place a man with a sword
[30:32] again,
[30:34] the seventh angel messenger
[30:37] so that to bring that whole thing and
[30:39] tie it back again
[30:44] messenger
[30:45] And the seventh angel messenger,
[30:49] he took the book
[30:51] and
[30:53] he says page 20, standing in the gap.
[30:58] Standing, you understand? Standing in
[30:59] the gap.
[31:02] Adam
[31:04] left the place.
[31:07] So he come in the gap
[31:11] for the operation again.
[31:18] And God broke them,
[31:20] sent them down to the seventh,
[31:23] not to the first, not to the second, but
[31:26] to the seventh to make it a complete
[31:29] thing
[31:32] that that vacancy
[31:35] is closed.
[31:38] [Music]
[31:42] Amen. Amen.
[31:44] Amen. My soul say
[31:48] I was trying to say to you
[31:51] the last thing. Listen
[31:55] uh
[31:56] in the Old Testament
[31:59] he was behind a badger scheme
[32:03] and Israel knew that. So they come and
[32:06] worship knowing that God is behind this.
[32:12] The glory of God was behind
[32:16] the skin.
[32:17] I repeat again, maybe today you'll be
[32:20] happy. You'll accept it and
[32:23] now the glory of God
[32:26] is behind your skin.
[32:31] Amen. Amen. That's right.
[32:35] And the traditions don't see it
[32:39] inside the veil.
[32:42] What was on the inside of the skin back
[32:44] there
[32:48] is now behind
[32:52] skin.
[32:55] Amen. Amen.
[32:58] Let's just stand up.
[33:01] It says John looked beyond the curtain
[33:03] of time and said,
[33:07] "There is John." there.
[33:10] There goes John.
[33:13] There's a song I I like. I'm trying to I
[33:17] have tried to ask the sisters to sing it
[33:19] for
[33:21] where they say
[33:25] I'm asking. I'm saying
[33:28] is your name? You know what I'm talking
[33:30] about. You know that song. Amen.
[33:37] Is your name there? If if your name is
[33:40] there, you're a happy person today.
[33:45] Let's close our eyes.
[33:48] And we're going to ask
[33:50] brother

[34:46] Most gracious eternal father,
[34:49] what a honor and a privilege, Lord.
[34:52] Hallelujah.
[34:54] No wonder your servant could say that
[34:56] great day, Lord. When it was time for
[34:59] him to speak to the audience about the
[35:02] seventh seal,
[35:04] Lord, he stopped and he said he feel
[35:08] checked.
[35:09] Then he said, "Don't worry.
[35:12] God is going to give it to you at the
[35:15] appointed time. At the right time."
[35:19] He said, "Wait for it." Yes. Almighty
[35:22] God, we want to thank you this
[35:24] afternoon, oh Lord, that you keep your
[35:26] promises.
[35:28] We are now living in that day, Lord.
[35:31] Where you are giving it to us, where you
[35:34] are opening our eyes to see, the same
[35:37] thing that he saw, Lord. Lord, he said
[35:40] it thunders seven times and he saw
[35:43] something flying out, almighty God, into
[35:46] something he could make out, but you
[35:48] couldn't give him permission to tell us.
[35:50] Because almighty God, you had ordained
[35:52] servants. You had ordained earthly
[35:55] vessels of honor in your house that will
[35:59] stand in our midst, Lord and give you to
[36:02] us in a way that we would understand it,
[36:05] in a way that we will see.
[36:08] And today it is becoming plain to us.
[36:11] Today it is opening unto us, Lord. We
[36:14] don't know what to say back to you,
[36:16] Almighty God, because you are revealing
[36:18] yourself among us. making yourselves
[36:21] known in this end of time, oh God,
[36:24] bringing together, join together to you,
[36:26] Almighty God, all them that were you in
[36:29] the beginning. And we are so happy,
[36:32] Almighty God, that way in the beginning,
[36:35] you put something within your children
[36:37] that at the appointed time when your
[36:40] revelation comes forth, they will be
[36:42] able to sense you, Lord. They will
[36:45] recognize you, Lord. they will know that
[36:47] it's the father revealing himself. We
[36:51] are privileged almighty God that we were
[36:54] not back there in 64 when he stood and
[36:57] said the mighty God unveiled but we are
[37:00] here in 207 when the mighty God is
[37:03] unveiled again
[37:05] from the human.
[37:07] We are privileged to be father. Almighty
[37:10] God, it's my prayer this afternoon.
[37:13] Lord, may each and everyone who is here
[37:16] this afternoon, may they go home, Lord,
[37:19] with a picture. May they go home with a
[37:22] vision of the almighty God living among
[37:26] his people, living among his church. For
[37:29] it's your own doing, Lord. It's your own
[37:32] work. Nothing to do with man.
