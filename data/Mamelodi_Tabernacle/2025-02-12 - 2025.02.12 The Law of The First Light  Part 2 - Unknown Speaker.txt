TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for [Music] [Music] something amen or something okay because the Bible says there was war [Music] where Have You Ever Seen the war between God and Satan how how Fierce it was do you have an idea how the war of amagon is going is going to be like the prophet says it's going to be a very terrible War between light and darkness between the righteous and the UN amen amen you've never seen it so that Shook and shifted some things when Mel drew his SW [Music] and fought the devil and Angels amen amen then that's why when the prophet looked through the dimensions he saw that this thing happening it is from another civilization this this is what caused the world to be void and even scientists don't have the answer to that amen and science knows about evolution and it doesn't exist I mean they are EV type of evolution men men at the beginning was like was an ape amen so they need okay here we we read now now and uh now the I believe the sea every seat was lying right there from some other civil because even the war in heaven could not misplace the seeds it could misplace them but it could [Music] destroy now when everything was domed and God said let there be light amen amen you will see what happens when there is light you are able to see the four quarters you are able to see what is coming you are able to see what is going as the pastor says no one can shift us why because you the darkness cannot overcome light amen amen say we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we are know where we are going amen amen ah we don't have to ask somebody to interpret it okay now here it says uh every seat was lying there from another civilization and as soon as the water lifted off you know when the light strike the water lifted off then come up the trees he says the same thing with the human being it's a woman and soon as the light struck amen amen and prostitution had to give way because the light has come and and a prostitution cannot H share with light the same place with the light amen so you see what is the very same thing how he did with the the Earth he did with you and me the Bible says listen to Ephesians I will read you quickly the book of Ephesians um Ephesians Ephesians Ephesians Ephesians chapter 5 I think it's verse eight let me check first for you were once Darkness but now are you light in the Lord right you were once Darkness but now you are light in the Lord walk as children of light you see the very same time your body types the Earth your soul types okay now let me pass here we have found it so there were seeds there and because the seeds now God said let there be light because down there there is some SE now let's find it here again because now the light has to bring life this SE both it must be both the natural because this one is natural which verse 14 says God created some lights that was for day and night now we have day and night here and we also have you hear of the the children of Night of the night and the children of the light you have both children of light and Children Of Darkness amen so God typed it all the way down to this age the natural typing the spiritual now it it's going to show that everything that we have here you if you are a Christian it's not a new thing because in the book who is this me prophet of God says if you have eternal life because you always had etal life do not start at a certain tent at the Revival spot no eternal life was eternal life who have eternal life they always had eternal whatever happened before could never change them amen but only what happened is look at the wise God WID of God now when when the the the the Earth was void and without any form God came to give it a form amen restore it back again and that's why another war is coming it is called the Battle of because the New Jerusalem is coming now the Jerusalem that we are going to is coming amen amen the Lord is coming the city is coming they are coming here so only the Bible says this Earth shall burn with fire it's not an analiation but shall only be yeah with fire then we are going to live right here in the new one and the Sea shall burn because the sea was the water that covered and the devil you know when then God said he separated the water and Satan went down with the water amen then he established himself [Music] under under the sea he's ever since operating from there he he he used to operate in space amen amen in space on the surface and under but he he has established himself under that's why if you read Revelation chapter 13 it speaks of a beast that came out of the sea which we need to look at that another time a beast that came out of the sea uh will happen during the tribulation period which is three and a half years the bride of Christ is not there that's why now the devil worship us they operate in three spheres amen no not in heaven he was cast out of Heaven the Bible says we battle against the the the the the the principalities yeah the principalities in the a not in heaven he was he was Michael defeated him and he was cast out of heaven but he has just established himself from space down here [Music] all right okay that's why now Our Gospel should come in three spheres worshiped in heaven and every KNE shall [Music] bow and John says heard me cry [Music] creature ration the angel that announced can I read it to you listen at this Angel what he saying Revelation 10 verse 5 10 verse 5 it says and the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to Heaven see upon the and the third he lifted up the the hand to he made sure that it's in three Realms verse six says and he saw by him who liveth forever and ever created heaven and the things that are in it the earth and the things that are in it the Sea and the things that are in it that there should be the time shall be no more so the the announcement is to the three dimensions heaven to the Sea amen am that's why now you have Revelation chapter 13 a beast from from the sea and Revelation 13: 11 1: 11 another beast from the earth and then because another one which is not a beast another one which is not a beast is coming from Heaven amen amen so it's always three the Lord also he comes with a a coverting from heaven with a book in his amen amen and one leg on the water one leg on the sea because there's a beast coming out of the water and the Beast coming out of the sea so when this one comes now this one is from heaven now amen amen because he said in book of Hebrews I shall make my my en my enemy my foot St so the Bible says one foot upon the Earth One upon the sea because the enemy is coming from the sea and from the Earth all right amen so you see now it's always three all right amen now this light this light now I'm I'm I'm trying to find something again here um which I must read okay okay okay hold on a bit this is a man that can turn on the light that can turn on the light of the he also says in this one if then the P page I'll bring the page okay but just listen to no no no no no the page is here now listen to this um in correspondence with the one we have just read from the book ofs now the seed God separate separated Darkness from light or light from Darkness he separates death from life he does it by his word now the seed was already upon the Earth God planted the seed just as long as the sun could get to that seed now at that time it was Darkness now God had to open up for the light to catch the sea just like denominations we were religion was like voidness of the church amen you could not even see the church which one is the church of Christ the bride because it was all Darkness but down there until God said let there be light let there be light that very had to come in this Ag and Zar said it be light evening time why because both the the morning light one is the morning light one is the morning light one is the evening so that very same Morning Light is the same even in light that even in [Music] light is the same the Lord Jesus says like lightening from the other part of the earth the other part of that's how he will come shining forth from the other part to the other part now it's not two Lightnings it's one lightning from the other part to the other amen so meaning that it is the the same [Music] Christ all right amen now when he was on the earth he was with them in the form of Jesus all right and then he had to come now to us in the form of a man but since we were born of the men and the woman the Lord had to cover that by coming to that flesh born of the man and the woman in order to change that body maybe you didn't hear our bodies came not like the body of Jesus Christ body of Jesus Christ came not through Mary and Joseph it was through an Angel and the [Music] woman it is Gabriel who came to the woman not Joseph what he brought to the woman was life from God the word into Mary and when Mary lived that way then that materal then when it materialized it became blood and it is called the blood of God the blood of God that was in the in a vision sorry it was in a vision all right amen so now in the last days God had to do it to bring now the we our body which was not which was born of the man and the woman now to bring that to bring that in our body it came by an Angel am Hallelujah the seventh angel brought the word to the bride Glory you know finally because when the the messenger came he is a man like you and me and then that was a church age now Mary was a natural woman there came an angel from Heaven to Mary and that's how the son came and the Lord Jesus is coming but he through it the same way the bride of Christ and theel amen amen now brother Brenham the angel to the churches but later he introduced an angel from eternity now that is that angel coming to the bride and the bride will give birth that's right now you see where is going it's not just believing the message it's something that God has done and is here at theend time amen amen what makes these pastors to believe the way they believe no it's not because of their wisdom it is because it is from there amen amen so you can't change them because even the battle there couldn't change them so nothing can change them if it is an original seed if it is an original se you cannot change it right amen you can say what you want Facebook can say the way it wants to say it will never change us because there is a Facebook church church Facebook amen amen but it shall not go unchallenged because they are the Facebook Facebook Facebook we are the Lamb's Book [Music] of Amen so that's that's the the difference all right we don't use Facebook to speak we are the of Life L's Book of Life we talk to the people if there something wrong we we we use the Bible brother you have done wrong here but the people who are not in the L's Book of Life they use Facebook Facebook amen amen those in the book of God they use the book of God God's book verus Facebook I'm working on that we are not they can't be left unchallenged I want to show you what is Facebook and what is the Lamb's Book of so which one should we follow Facebook just arrived yesterday what'sapp what just came yesterday they found us in the Lord the gospel was there without any Facebook any WhatsApp even before there was a a telephone the gospel was already in Jerusalem Jem we don't hear of any television in Jerusalem when Jesus was there we only hear about Jesus amen only we don't hear of any progamer and all right these are things that came yesterday amen we've been here before they existed we don't even need them in in the coming World amen amen because we have a a means of communication the Bible says of Paul Paul went up you want me to read it to you before we we we close we should not be here until late I want to say don't don't read is just Galatians 2 ver2 and I went up by Revel [Music] and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately to them who were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vain I went there by and communicated unto them amen amen through Facebook no because a child of God is a perfect system child of amen he's a perfect system okay I've got a message on on this Communications I'm just working on that all right I want to help the people to come out of this things and come back to the Bible to the word of God all right amen okay now for a few minutes yeah we are here now I think we've done gone through that I wanted us to realize there's two different things there in Genesis this light chapter 1 verse one is different from the lights 1 verse 14 verse you see it's two different things amen one is chapter one verse one verse one which a certain scientist he said we don't know about that one I've got the book at home he says we don't know about this light of of Genesis 1 verse1 a scientist he understands verse 1 verse 14 because it says natur [Music] the stars is different amen okay now for for can you survive 5 minutes all right listen for 5 minutes I'm going back to the Book of Genesis because the first light the spoken word the first light is the spoken word if you are in darkness and you can't see around you you can't see what is coming what is going you need light I remember one day we were at now around us is Bush now we had a powerful lamp there had one powerful light um what they call them now okay anyhow it's camping camping L now during the night we flushed light and that thing is powerful it casts a very powerful beam spting like this then we realize that not far from us not far from us there were some animals drinking water the zebras but without that we couldn't know that Ze so you need because with light your eyes are only limited amen they've got some limits but light you can have ice but when when it is dark like in Egypt they don't work have you seen people Especial people from the cities when they arrive in the remote areas they work like this amen they can't see maybe somebody living there to lead them because now the light of the one living there not the amen it is what is recorded all right amen now that person knows that this way there's no holy here or there's nothing here or a stone no he he he doesn't need to open his eyes because already it is programmed in amen that's why now the people while they are talking while the people are talking they don't know that the things that we believe are programmed in US amen amen and programmed and sealed by God that's why when pilate he said to Jesus are you the king of the Jews you have you have said it already it is registered it is it is programmed amen amen so yeah you already said it amen if somebody comes and say I hear that you are saying you are Min Gods you already said [Applause] it I I don't need to answer him because God said let us make men in our image that man is a minor God I hear that said you say you you are one with God already said because Jesus you shall know that I am in you we are with let me close my friends continue listen this so wonderful you'll be back in church this light the light and the seed it shows the predestinated will read you will see that it is the very same light the light that has opened up your your eyes the light that has revealed who you are is the very same light that recognized that down in this water water here under this Darkness there seed there is the Earth and there is the sea that very same light when he struck the water they open up I can say in closing here just the same as you are the Earth your body your body is the and the inside of this Earth the light came and the soul that was in You destinated by God the seed that was there came from God and the seed that is in you came from God all things came from Heaven even Jerusalem is coming amen amen the Garden of Eden Came From Heaven were molded in heaven and were sent down here to materal and anything that did not come from him cannot make it back if you see the people refusing to believe God the poor souls were not there so it is impossible something that did not come from there to recognize and go back am amen the only people that are going back going back means a pastor reminded Us in m and he said we are not going to to heaven when we die we are returning amen amen amen then the prophet says Prophet uh if you were not there it is impossible to see these things why because this things are coming from it can be from a doctor of divinity because you can ask him when were you born doctor you just came yesterday I studied at I went to England I went to Scotland Scotland to achieve my what what what amen then my answer is and then you say where did you get these things from they asked me in ining four doctors they came like this to me after I officiated [Music] there how are you where did you learn [Music] this this word of God I said in heaven that is me [Applause] there was a taller one with spectacles that's true am yeah that's true and these other that's true amen amen I Scotland before there was Scotland I was already there amen amen hallelujah so I don't need to go to Scotland but because where is the message inside it's here in our midst of us we'll read tomorrow to them uh look he doesn't come let me read for you just hold it just there and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation but the kingdom of God is in the must I say Scotland is not in Scotland not Bible School school it's in your midst amen now Jesus was in their midst saying to them the kingdom of God here with to God amen amen only they were refusing like the people today they refuse to enter instead they will walk away in trying to establish their own kingdom okay so God bless you amen bow our heads in our heavenly father we just want to thank you again this evening for teaching out to us your word which know man there's no one who can touch our hearts like your word father like you so we are here this evening thanking you for the word that came this way and for the blessings upon us yes and I believe that everyone who entered this place and was afflicted a has has got no reason to say I am still sick yes because father I've seen the people coming in and they would give their hearts to God and God will deal with them in a very perfect way until all their diseases they will live under the impact of the message and the Revelation that is coming from God and that's why we believe that even this evening some of us came in here and we were sick when we entered this building but some of us are going back without any sick sickness or disease because the impact of your word as brother Brenham says the word is a great healer and father we believe that even tomorrow coming to the service those that are sick will not remain home because this is the place the place of restoration and where the sick get gets the sick get healed and father we are so glad tonight to have this time uh you have given to us bless our pastors here and the Shepherd that they they the sheep that they shepherd and father we bless you and so thankful to have you in our midst and in our hearts and we are looking forward for to another day of which we don't know what tomorrow will bring but we only know that you holds tomorrow and you are our tomorrow as I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen [Music]
