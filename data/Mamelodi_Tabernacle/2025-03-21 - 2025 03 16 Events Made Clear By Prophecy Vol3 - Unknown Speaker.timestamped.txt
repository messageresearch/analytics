[59:46] than your life.
[59:59] There is
[1:00:02] There is
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:23] only as we ask our elder
[1:00:26] [Music]

[1:00:33] Lord. If you have a request in your
[1:00:37] heart, just raise a hand and the Lord
[1:00:40] will bless
[1:00:45] you. Let us pray once again.
[1:00:50] Gracious
[1:00:52] Lord, being the great
[1:00:56] physician, being the one Lord Almighty
[1:00:59] who
[1:01:00] said, "He that is
[1:01:03] overladen, let him come to me, I will
[1:01:07] relieve him of the weight that you'll be
[1:01:09] carrying."
[1:01:11] And
[1:01:12] father this
[1:01:14] morning we have requests of different
[1:01:18] kinds that comes
[1:01:21] from the believers Lord and even people
[1:01:25] outside. They didn't go
[1:01:28] to any
[1:01:30] soothsayer to request
[1:01:33] assistance but father they prefer to
[1:01:36] come unto
[1:01:37] thee knowing that
[1:01:40] Lord you are always in
[1:01:42] season and you always hear our
[1:01:46] prayers. So this morning,
[1:01:48] Father, we come unto thee,
[1:01:51] Lord, committing all these requests unto
[1:01:55] thee knowing, Lord
[1:01:58] Almighty, that there's not even a single
[1:02:01] one that won't be attended to because
[1:02:04] they came to the right place.
[1:02:06] Father, in the Old Testament, you used
[1:02:09] to stop
[1:02:11] people from going to strange God and
[1:02:14] say, "Is there no guide? Is there no god
[1:02:17] among you that you could go to strange
[1:02:20] gods? And father
[1:02:23] nowadays people knows that when they
[1:02:27] come to you they come to the right
[1:02:29] place.
[1:02:30] May you extend lord almighty your hand
[1:02:34] lord and protect them and bless them and
[1:02:39] give them according to your promise. You
[1:02:43] said you'll always be with us and even
[1:02:46] this morning you are with us. Father,
[1:02:48] thank you Lord for we pray calling upon
[1:02:53] the greatest name ever, the name of our
[1:02:56] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[1:13:43] Amen. Amen. As I greet you all in the
[1:13:46] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:13:49] Christ, we want to thank God again this
[1:13:54] morning for giving us the
[1:13:58] sunshine, a good
[1:14:01] weather, giving us
[1:14:04] life to come and dine on the master's
[1:14:07] table.
[1:14:11] Amen. Amen. So we will be continue with
[1:14:14] the word of
[1:14:15] God and God will bless us as he normally
[1:14:21] do that.
[1:14:23] Amen. Amen. While
[1:14:25] standing or before we read the
[1:14:28] scriptures I just want to tell the
[1:14:30] children of God
[1:14:32] again that we were in the previous
[1:14:37] week and since we visited
[1:14:42] We always baptize
[1:14:44] people. So he blessed as we told two
[1:14:47] souls last
[1:14:50] week that normally
[1:14:53] travel is a place
[1:14:57] called Amen. So while I was looking at
[1:15:01] the map
[1:15:03] of I've realized that there's two three
[1:15:08] district that's left.
[1:15:12] if we visit them and preach the word of
[1:15:15] God. We will be preaching the message
[1:15:17] the entirely
[1:15:21] soon. So and all other district we
[1:15:24] visited we baptized
[1:15:28] people. Yeah. There's a place called we
[1:15:31] want to go
[1:15:33] there. The other one is snake.
[1:15:37] No. The other one
[1:15:39] is Kasha and the other one is river.
[1:15:44] If we can visit those three
[1:15:47] district this ministry has gone
[1:15:50] far. I I remember when the pastor
[1:15:54] commissioned us
[1:15:57] to he said to us you are going to preach
[1:16:00] to the people that God has prepared
[1:16:03] already.
[1:16:07] You know if God has prepared
[1:16:10] something, you don't strike it. You just
[1:16:13] say a word and the people
[1:16:17] respond because it's God who called
[1:16:20] them. So thanks for your
[1:16:24] prayers. It is because you pray for all
[1:16:26] these
[1:16:29] outreaches. We see God doing wonders.
[1:16:33] keep on praying for the missions.
[1:16:39] Let's pray for our Easter services as
[1:16:42] well here at home and other
[1:16:46] areas. Amen. Amen. May God richly bless
[1:16:50] you and then let's open our
[1:16:53] Bible in the book of Daniel chapter 2.
[1:17:00] Today we are going to wrap
[1:17:03] up. I'm bringing the part three of the
[1:17:06] message we
[1:17:07] preached
[1:17:09] previously were events made clear by
[1:17:14] prophecy. Today is the last
[1:17:18] part of that message. Amen.
[1:17:22] Amen. Let's bow our head and pray.
[1:17:27] Gracious and eternal father, we want to
[1:17:30] thank you Lord God this morning for the
[1:17:33] wonderful day you have given unto us.
[1:17:35] Amen. Oh father God the prophet has
[1:17:37] taught us that between us and the
[1:17:39] sinners it's such a thin line. No wonder
[1:17:42] this morning we appreciate every bit of
[1:17:45] our life. It is because of not because
[1:17:48] of what we know. It is because of your
[1:17:50] grace. We will forever appreciate you
[1:17:54] Lord God. Bless each and every
[1:17:56] individual this morning when we started
[1:17:58] the service. We call upon your name even
[1:18:01] before the reading of the scripture. We
[1:18:02] will call upon your name for you are the
[1:18:05] author of this great book. We know
[1:18:07] heavenly father there are many book that
[1:18:09] were written in the universities and so

[1:18:14] want to change it but you are wait the

[1:18:20] changed for our name are written in the
[1:18:23] lamb's book of life. It's an eternal
[1:18:25] book heavenly father that was inspired
[1:18:28] by you. It's in every moment when we

[1:18:35] scripture this morning. May you inspire
[1:18:38] us Lord God. May you make us a good
[1:18:40] listeners. Lord God, we know heavenly
[1:18:43] father in life we have some challenges.

[1:18:48] demon has descended there because he
[1:18:50] know if he can catch them, there's no
[1:18:52] leaders of tomorrow. There's no children
[1:18:54] of God of tomorrow. So we pray for them
[1:18:57] that they should steadfastly stayed in
[1:18:59] this word for this word is the absolute
[1:19:02] of our life. Pray for the families.
[1:19:05] Heavenly Father, h God is a God of a
[1:19:08] family. No wonder heavenly father as we
[1:19:10] go unto the eternal city is the bride
[1:19:14] and the groom. It's a family. So we love
[1:19:16] you so much as we are worshiping as
[1:19:19] family. We believe heavenly father is
[1:19:21] just a foretaste of what you have
[1:19:23] prepared for us. We love you so much. I
[1:19:26] pray for our pastor heavenly father. I
[1:19:28] know he's streaming. He's listening to
[1:19:30] the word. He's the one heavenly father
[1:19:32] inspiring us from this pulpit because
[1:19:35] it's belonging to him. May you help him
[1:19:37] heavenly father and give him courage
[1:19:39] each day for we love him so much. Lord
[1:19:42] God, we appreciate you and we give you
[1:19:45] honor in everything in the name of our
[1:19:47] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:52] Amen. Amen. Let's read our regular
[1:19:56] scripture.
[1:19:58] From the book of
[1:20:00] Daniel 2. Yes. Amen. Amen. Well, let's
[1:20:04] let's
[1:20:06] read 34 to 35 for
[1:20:09] now. Amen.
[1:20:17] Thou sawest till that a stone was cut
[1:20:20] out without hands, which smoked the
[1:20:23] image upon his feet that were of iron
[1:20:26] and clay, and break them to pieces. Then
[1:20:30] was the iron, the clay, the brass, the
[1:20:33] silver, and the gold broken to pieces
[1:20:35] together, and became like the the chaff
[1:20:40] of the summer threshing floors. And the
[1:20:43] wind carried them away, that no place
[1:20:46] was found for them. And the stone that
[1:20:49] the image became a great mountain, and
[1:20:51] filled the whole earth. Amen. You may be
[1:20:55] seated. Amen.
[1:21:00] As I
[1:21:01] said is the part three of the previous
[1:21:03] message we spoke
[1:21:05] about. But the subtitle this
[1:21:10] morning getting into the new city
[1:21:15] Jerusalem and then that is the end of
[1:21:19] everything. Amen. Amen. When we speak
[1:21:22] about the eternal
[1:21:24] city, we speak about the new Jerusalem.
[1:21:28] When we speak about where we will spend
[1:21:31] our
[1:21:33] eternity is the new
[1:21:35] Jerusalem is the end of our
[1:21:39] journey and everything going
[1:21:44] eternal. Amen. Amen. So I was reading or
[1:21:50] looking at the
[1:21:51] news. Those that normally check the
[1:21:55] news, you'll start to realize
[1:21:57] that
[1:21:59] everything came to an
[1:22:02] end. There's nothing new that will
[1:22:06] come. Yes, everything came to an
[1:22:09] end. I just want to give you an example
[1:22:12] of what is
[1:22:13] happening. I was looking at the
[1:22:17] conversation between the president of
[1:22:20] USA
[1:22:23] president of
[1:22:25] Ukraine and of Russia
[1:22:30] as they were talking
[1:22:32] because of the
[1:22:34] war that is raging. Amen. Amen. What
[1:22:38] what causes
[1:22:40] war is is a
[1:22:42] disagreement of some
[1:22:45] sort. when we
[1:22:48] disagree and not reach an
[1:22:51] agreement, we we start fighting. There's
[1:22:54] something I picked
[1:22:56] up when the president of
[1:22:59] America was talking to the president of
[1:23:04] Ukraine. He said, "I I don't like your
[1:23:08] behavior because the game you are
[1:23:12] playing, you lead us to the third world.
[1:23:17] I grabbed it. I interrogated the
[1:23:21] things wanting to know what he mean.
[1:23:26] What will be the next
[1:23:29] thing? Amen. Amen. So the third world
[1:23:33] war does not start when the superpower
[1:23:37] country
[1:23:41] fight but it start when the small
[1:23:45] country started to
[1:23:48] disagree and the bigger
[1:23:50] one them
[1:23:52] up what is happening in Ukraine. Let me
[1:23:57] give you the background.
[1:24:00] Ukraine in the olden
[1:24:02] days was part of
[1:24:05] Russia. People in the Ukraine
[1:24:08] are Russians.
[1:24:11] You understand? More especially those
[1:24:13] one on the border of
[1:24:17] Ukraine
[1:24:19] Russians. Before I get there, let Before
[1:24:22] I get there, let me give you this
[1:24:25] example. I was following this war of
[1:24:28] this place called
[1:24:31] GMA in
[1:24:33] DRC. What was
[1:24:35] happening is the eastern part of
[1:24:41] DRC next
[1:24:43] to when I trace the thing those people
[1:24:47] in
[1:24:48] DRC
[1:24:50] are. So when they
[1:24:52] fight Paul
[1:24:57] will stand for them and the South
[1:25:00] African
[1:25:02] soldiers were killed there because they
[1:25:05] were
[1:25:07] peacemakers. When you look peacemakers
[1:25:09] for
[1:25:10] that, you will realize how cruel is this
[1:25:16] world. They were not
[1:25:19] peacemakers, to protect the people, but
[1:25:22] they were
[1:25:23] peacemakers to
[1:25:25] protect the mind for the
[1:25:29] elite for the
[1:25:32] elite. Amen. Amen. That's what is
[1:25:35] happening. I was reading in Ukraine,
[1:25:41] his son has got
[1:25:43] business in Ukraine. So you go there
[1:25:48] working for the government not not
[1:25:51] knowing in fact you are protecting the
[1:25:54] properties for the
[1:25:59] elite. Take an example here at home. You
[1:26:02] go to the mine every day when we get to
[1:26:05] the
[1:26:06] mine we find soldiers we find police
[1:26:12] saying they don't want the strike.
[1:26:16] But go to the schools of the government,
[1:26:20] go to the clinic, go to the government
[1:26:23] building, no one is protecting
[1:26:27] them. So it's the interest of the people
[1:26:30] that are up
[1:26:33] there, those that read the news. You see
[1:26:37] how small
[1:26:40] is challenged South Africa
[1:26:44] now they say free state belongs to us
[1:26:48] and when you look at free state
[1:26:53] it's you understand then when South
[1:26:56] Africa tried to
[1:26:58] rise is said you don't do it I'm on the
[1:27:03] side
[1:27:04] of such small
[1:27:06] wars. Such
[1:27:09] disagreement lead to the third
[1:27:12] world because if you can't the one
[1:27:17] having the upper
[1:27:18] hand will stand for you. When Paul
[1:27:22] Kagami tried to
[1:27:24] speak Russia said you don't dare do
[1:27:27] that.
[1:27:30] Amen. Amen. So Donald Trump being the
[1:27:34] peacemaker
[1:27:36] said to you know
[1:27:39] Vladimir
[1:27:41] no Zilinski
[1:27:44] he said to him the only thing that you
[1:27:49] must do you must do what Putin is
[1:27:53] asking because if you don't do it we are
[1:27:57] going to the third
[1:27:59] world and put in that moment he's quiet
[1:28:03] the moment he start talking. He said to
[1:28:06] the world to the
[1:28:09] European, you small European
[1:28:12] countries, if you want to challenge
[1:28:14] me, you must really brace
[1:28:18] yourself. You know, he's standing in
[1:28:21] front of something like a pool
[1:28:23] pit. There's a there's a red
[1:28:27] button. He said to them, "If you jump, I
[1:28:32] press." And Donald Trump is very much
[1:28:36] aware of it that Russia is well
[1:28:40] armed. If that
[1:28:43] man said it can only take a drunk
[1:28:47] man, press a button and then the entire
[1:28:51] world
[1:28:53] is Vladimir Putin standing
[1:28:57] there. I'm not scared of America. I'm
[1:29:00] not scared of Europe. I'm not scared of
[1:29:04] UK start. I will show you. So the
[1:29:08] disagreement of Russia, USA, Ukraine,
[1:29:13] Europe, we don't even count
[1:29:17] Africa. The
[1:29:19] disagreement will lead to the third
[1:29:22] world war.
[1:29:24] only thing that left even them they are
[1:29:29] aware and they are talking about it. So
[1:29:33] when you look nothing is left I heard
[1:29:36] him Donald Trump
[1:29:38] saying to the prime minister of
[1:29:41] UK saying can you challenge Russia
[1:29:44] alone?
[1:29:50] Amen.
[1:29:53] He couldn't know what to say because he
[1:29:56] knows exactly he cannot
[1:29:58] challenge. So the wars that come lead us
[1:30:03] to the third world
[1:30:06] war is the last war that will usher us
[1:30:11] into eternity. You you you will see how
[1:30:15] brother Brenam put it here because I
[1:30:18] said some
[1:30:20] previously but today we are getting into
[1:30:23] the
[1:30:25] music. Amen. Amen. I made a small
[1:30:30] presentation for your
[1:30:33] understanding if you can put it for us.
[1:30:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:42] Mhm.
[1:30:43] This is what Nebuchadnezzar
[1:30:49] dreamed but he forgot about
[1:30:52] it from his
[1:30:54] time until
[1:30:57] eternity. He saw what happened. That is
[1:31:00] why he was so
[1:31:02] troubled of what is happening because I
[1:31:06] see this kind of an image and I don't
[1:31:09] understand it. So he saw this. Daniel
[1:31:13] came and explained to him, "You
[1:31:17] Nebuchadnezzar, you are the
[1:31:20] gold." Amen. You are on top of
[1:31:23] everything. You have power the entire
[1:31:26] world. But there will come a kingdom
[1:31:30] after. Amen. And another kingdom. And
[1:31:34] another kingdom and the last kingdom as
[1:31:37] written there. Amen. Amen. So now when
[1:31:42] you look at when you look at this this
[1:31:45] kingdom all of them Babylon until Rome
[1:31:51] they were into
[1:31:54] ashes but another
[1:31:56] kingdom came and stayed
[1:32:01] eternal. Amen. Amen. Mean in this
[1:32:04] kingdom they were
[1:32:07] temporal in this world. When we are here
[1:32:11] this morning we are longing to be in
[1:32:14] that eternal
[1:32:16] kingdom because the temporal
[1:32:20] kingdom taking us nowhere.
[1:32:24] So when you look at the go to the next
[1:32:26] slide,
[1:32:28] the Bible says there was a stone being
[1:32:32] cut and not by the hand of a man and it
[1:32:36] hit right at the
[1:32:39] bottom of the
[1:32:41] image. When it hit the bottom of the
[1:32:45] image, there at the bottom of the image
[1:32:49] is Russia. Russia and America. America
[1:32:53] is
[1:32:54] clay and isle is
[1:32:57] Rome hidden.
[1:33:00] Rome hidden
[1:33:03] behind America.
[1:33:05] America being the
[1:33:07] lamb being the
[1:33:10] peacemaker but Rome even that still
[1:33:14] being the
[1:33:15] beast. I want to tell you this. All the
[1:33:19] wars that America started
[1:33:22] saying they bring
[1:33:23] peace in Libya,
[1:33:26] in Iraq, in all other
[1:33:29] places. Is there still a peace today?
[1:33:34] They suffered
[1:33:37] before. Amen. Amen. When you read the
[1:33:39] history of Libya,
[1:33:43] they say there was no
[1:33:46] orphan orphan.
[1:33:50] There was no poor people. The people
[1:33:53] lived good life. They had hospital. They
[1:33:58] had schools. They had everything. But
[1:34:01] since Russia, I mean since America say
[1:34:04] they are bringing peace into the
[1:34:07] country. Now they regret what they did
[1:34:10] to their leader. Amen. Amen. So when you
[1:34:14] look at
[1:34:15] America, it's Rome hidden
[1:34:20] behind. Amen. Amen. So it comes as a
[1:34:23] lamb. It comes as a
[1:34:26] unifier. When the president of
[1:34:29] America speak to the one of Russia, he
[1:34:33] knows what he's capable
[1:34:36] of. He can play his cards very well.
[1:34:40] The only thing that can win
[1:34:42] is when he compromised
[1:34:46] Ukraine to fall in the you know in the
[1:34:49] knee of
[1:34:52] Russia. Amen. Amen. Then I went deeper
[1:34:56] studying
[1:34:57] this. I even saw some cl some
[1:35:02] videos. When the United Kingdom
[1:35:05] soldiers,
[1:35:06] troops, United Kingdom go to Ukraine to
[1:35:11] help. They never went back
[1:35:13] home. All dead. The USA
[1:35:18] eight
[1:35:19] team went there.
[1:35:23] The German went there.
[1:35:27] Amen. You know,
[1:35:30] Russia stood in a strategic
[1:35:34] area
[1:35:36] whereby they see you, you don't see
[1:35:39] them. The moment you see
[1:35:43] them, you are
[1:35:45] dead. Those people, they are 10 times
[1:35:48] ahead of the entire world.
[1:35:53] When Donald Trump look at them, he
[1:35:56] realized that yeah, here we met the real
[1:36:02] people. They are not easy. That's why he
[1:36:05] said to this one, listen to
[1:36:08] Putin, you shall survive. Otherwise, you
[1:36:12] go to third world
[1:36:14] war. And let me tell you, there's no
[1:36:17] other way. The third world war is the
[1:36:21] war that should come and lead us into
[1:36:25] eternity. You know why? The Bible says
[1:36:29] there's three
[1:36:32] ws. The three
[1:36:34] wars, the first world war, the second
[1:36:37] world war and the third world war. They
[1:36:40] must happen. The third one they talking
[1:36:43] about. It must happen.
[1:36:48] Amen. Amen. So at the moment they are
[1:36:51] just trying this and
[1:36:52] that is leading to the third
[1:36:56] world. But we thank God the rapture will
[1:37:00] take
[1:37:01] us is the first thing that the Christ
[1:37:06] will take. That was the first step to
[1:37:10] eternity. Amen. Amen. Now all this
[1:37:14] kingdom will be finished. That
[1:37:18] stone heat the
[1:37:22] clay and the
[1:37:25] iron. The clay is Russia. The iron is
[1:37:30] America. America. The the prophet says
[1:37:34] so as in war and cru.
[1:37:39] Amen. representing the eastern and the
[1:37:41] western
[1:37:43] countries. That is what will happen. So
[1:37:47] the Russian
[1:37:48] themselves if they can win in the third
[1:37:52] world war is the finishing of
[1:37:55] everything when you read the Bible it
[1:37:58] says the only
[1:38:00] thing that
[1:38:02] left was dust.
[1:38:05] That stone hid right at the bottom
[1:38:09] of the
[1:38:11] image fell and became
[1:38:15] dust. When it becomes
[1:38:18] dust in history, he saw that
[1:38:22] stone becoming a big mountain.
[1:38:26] Here you get that big mountain it
[1:38:28] becomes a big
[1:38:31] city and in that city there are people
[1:38:35] that have it
[1:38:39] there. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:42] Nebuchadnezzar saw that
[1:38:45] thing he was
[1:38:47] troubled until Daniel come and explain
[1:38:50] to him. So whatever is happening
[1:38:54] today is leading us to the third
[1:38:58] world. There's no turning
[1:39:00] back. Putin speak about
[1:39:03] it. Donald Trump speak about it. And
[1:39:06] Putin said I'm scared of know
[1:39:10] what you can do whatever you want. I
[1:39:14] know which button to
[1:39:16] press and deal with you. When he speak
[1:39:19] to Gagam in
[1:39:21] Randa, he
[1:39:23] retreated. He knows
[1:39:26] Ronda is small in a minute can be
[1:39:32] ashes. When I was looking at the missile
[1:39:35] of
[1:39:36] Russia hitting the
[1:39:39] planes, Amen. and those tankers.
[1:39:42] I was
[1:39:44] wondering if maybe there's an something,
[1:39:47] you know, an an element or
[1:39:50] something that is pulling it to
[1:39:54] them because when the plane is going
[1:39:57] this
[1:39:58] side, they shoot from
[1:40:02] behind will take a direction to the
[1:40:08] plane. how advanced they
[1:40:11] are. One missile going
[1:40:14] out is not missing the
[1:40:18] target straight to the target.
[1:40:22] Amen. Amen. That is the only
[1:40:25] thing that is left. So my message today
[1:40:30] is getting into the
[1:40:33] news. Amen.
[1:40:36] Why? All
[1:40:38] kingdoms has failed. All kingdoms will
[1:40:43] collapse. The arms that they
[1:40:47] made is the one that is going to kill
[1:40:51] them, that is going to clean the whole
[1:40:54] world. So when looking at that stone,
[1:40:58] the stone was Christ
[1:41:00] himself eating all the
[1:41:03] kingdom was a big
[1:41:05] mountain. The mountain becames the big
[1:41:08] city and the big city was
[1:41:13] eternal. We can read it on verse 33 to
[1:41:19] 453 to 45.
[1:41:23] his legs of iron, his feet part of iron
[1:41:26] and part of clay. Thou sawest still that
[1:41:30] a stone was cut out without hands, which
[1:41:33] smote the image upon his feet that were
[1:41:36] of iron and clay, and break them to
[1:41:38] pieces. Then was the iron that lay the
[1:41:42] brass, the silver and the gold broken to
[1:41:45] pieces together and became like the
[1:41:48] shaft of the summer threshing floors.
[1:41:51] And the wind carried them away that no
[1:41:54] place was found for them. And the stone
[1:41:56] that smowed the image became a great
[1:41:58] mountain and filled the whole earth.
[1:42:02] This is the dream and we will tell the
[1:42:05] interpretation thereof before the king.
[1:42:08] Thou, oh king, are a king of kings, for
[1:42:12] the God of heaven hath given thee a
[1:42:14] kingdom. Amen. Stop there. Amen. That's
[1:42:17] what Daniel explained to
[1:42:21] Nebad. But the part I want to take here
[1:42:25] is verse
[1:42:26] 45 where we start our message. It says,
[1:42:31] "For as much as thou sawest that the
[1:42:34] stone was cut out of the
[1:42:37] mountain without hand, and that is break
[1:42:41] in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay,
[1:42:44] the silver, and the
[1:42:50] gold. And the great God had made known
[1:42:53] to the king what shall
[1:42:57] come here after." Amen. Amen. So that's
[1:43:01] where I want to
[1:43:02] start. The stone became the new city.
[1:43:08] The stone stayed
[1:43:12] eternal. Let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:43:19] 21. Amen.
[1:43:21] When you read Revelation chapter 21,
[1:43:26] you saw what the stone
[1:43:30] became turned
[1:43:32] into. Amen.
[1:43:34] Amen. And I saw a new
[1:43:37] heaven and a new earth. For the first
[1:43:41] heaven and the first earth were passed
[1:43:44] away, and there was no more sin.
[1:43:49] And I, John, saw the holy city, the new
[1:43:55] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[1:44:00] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:44:04] her
[1:44:06] husband. The answer for Daniel chapter
[1:44:10] 2 is Revelation chapter
[1:44:14] 21. That
[1:44:15] stone became the new seed.
[1:44:19] the new Jerusalem, the holy city, the
[1:44:23] one that stayed
[1:44:25] eternal. And there should be
[1:44:27] people that will stay in that
[1:44:31] seat. Brother Brham says, "The one that
[1:44:35] stayed in the city is the bride and the
[1:44:40] groom. For the bride and the groom are
[1:44:46] one." Amen. Amen. And that thing will
[1:44:50] stay
[1:44:52] eternal. That means there are people
[1:44:56] that are
[1:44:58] eternal. Amen. Amen. The bride is the
[1:45:02] people that got saved from Ephesus
[1:45:06] church until theian church. That is the
[1:45:10] bride of Jesus
[1:45:12] Christ. Those are the one that will be
[1:45:15] inhabitants.
[1:45:18] in the
[1:45:19] city. Amen. Amen. So when they stayed in
[1:45:23] the city, the Bible says there will be
[1:45:27] people outside of the city that they
[1:45:32] stay there to bring
[1:45:35] thanksgiving to the groom and the bride.
[1:45:40] Inside is
[1:45:42] us. Hallelujah.
[1:45:46] I last time
[1:45:48] said there's a nation of
[1:45:51] God and there's a church of
[1:45:54] God. The nation of God is
[1:45:59] Israel. If you are against
[1:46:01] Israel, you against God and there's a
[1:46:05] church of God is the bride of the Lord
[1:46:09] Jesus. You be against the bride of Jesus
[1:46:12] Christ. You are against
[1:46:15] God. Irrespective of the
[1:46:18] condition. You curse
[1:46:20] Israel, you shall be cursed. You curse
[1:46:24] the bride, you shall be cursed. Those
[1:46:27] are the two
[1:46:29] things that God
[1:46:31] wanted. God could have chose the
[1:46:34] Chinese, but we can blame him to choose
[1:46:38] Israel. God could have chose the
[1:46:42] Methodist church, but he chose you.
[1:46:49] He chose you and gives you the life
[1:46:55] eternal. No one can blame what God is
[1:47:00] doing. God is working on the
[1:47:04] predestination. Before the foundation of
[1:47:06] the world, he forneew
[1:47:09] you. Brothers and sisters, if before the
[1:47:13] foundation of the world, hell belongs to
[1:47:16] you. You can pray
[1:47:19] harder. You can fast, you can come to
[1:47:22] church, you will never go to
[1:47:28] heaven. But if heaven belongs to
[1:47:32] you. Amen. Amen. before the foundation
[1:47:35] of the world. You may go through a
[1:47:38] lot. You may fall, but you will
[1:47:41] arise. You will be sick, but you will be
[1:47:44] healed because heaven belongs to you.
[1:47:47] God is waiting on them. I normally say
[1:47:51] to us, brothers and sisters, let's just
[1:47:54] walk. Let's just walk upon the path that
[1:47:59] God has prepared for
[1:48:00] them. A complete job was done.
[1:48:04] And the Bible says he died for us at the
[1:48:09] cross before the foundation of the
[1:48:11] world. Before the foundation of the
[1:48:14] world, he knew you will be born in
[1:48:18] sin, shaped in
[1:48:20] iniquity, have problem of the world,
[1:48:24] have tested and so forth. But the
[1:48:26] heavens belongs to you.
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:33] That is why
[1:48:34] sometimes when we have worries about the
[1:48:37] things of the world, we sometimes miss
[1:48:40] who we are.
[1:48:44] If we can know who we are,
[1:48:47] uh we we we just
[1:48:49] war and say, "Lord God, you know the day
[1:48:54] I die, you know, the day I'm in the
[1:48:58] rapture, you know, why should I worry
[1:49:02] about the things that are temporal?"
[1:49:06] Nebuchadnezzar has seen the kingdom
[1:49:09] coming, powerful as they are. but they
[1:49:12] were temporal. And he saw the kingdom
[1:49:16] that will stay eternal and the people
[1:49:19] that will stay in the kingdom. I'm so
[1:49:22] happy this morning to stand in front of
[1:49:25] those people that are standing for
[1:49:29] eternal. We are the eternal being. We
[1:49:33] may look down at ourselves, but before
[1:49:36] God, we are more than a human being.
[1:49:39] We are
[1:49:41] supernatural. Let God open the eyes for
[1:49:44] us and see who we are. The people that
[1:49:48] are in the new city, that will be in the
[1:49:51] new
[1:49:52] city, they know themselves.
[1:49:57] Amen. Amen. Brother says, "Even if God
[1:50:02] can take me to hell, I will still say
[1:50:06] you are a good God.
[1:50:09] That is not just a saying. You know why
[1:50:13] is saying that? Because of one thing. He
[1:50:16] can't change anything. Can I repeat
[1:50:19] myself? He cannot
[1:50:22] change. A complete job was done just
[1:50:27] that at the right
[1:50:29] time
[1:50:31] unfold. God could have make you
[1:50:34] Adam, could have make you Enoch, but he
[1:50:37] knew you are not Enoch or Adam. But he
[1:50:41] make you who you are this morning for
[1:50:45] you to finish the race of a human
[1:50:48] being. We will be somewhere looking at
[1:50:52] Russia, looking at the
[1:50:55] man is talking
[1:50:57] about the party. We will be looking and
[1:51:01] say Lord God how
[1:51:05] merciful. Brothers and
[1:51:08] sisters we have done nothing go good
[1:51:11] before God. I want to be honest with
[1:51:14] you. We have done
[1:51:16] nothing but God do something good to us.
[1:51:20] That's why we are here this morning with
[1:51:23] courage to worship him because he
[1:51:26] revealed himself unto us. Amen.
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:36] I
[1:51:37] I
[1:51:39] testified to a certain brother when I
[1:51:42] was still young, not even
[1:51:45] married. Now the other brother asked
[1:51:49] this one whom I testified. He said, "How
[1:51:52] did you get the
[1:51:54] message?" He said, "No, now I talk too
[1:51:56] much. No one has testified to me. I just
[1:52:00] asked this man where you follow she then
[1:52:03] I said in Mori. Then we came
[1:52:06] together. That's how I got the message.
[1:52:09] Then I looked down and smiled. I said
[1:52:12] this kind of
[1:52:13] character. They don't go anywhere in
[1:52:16] life. I'm honest with
[1:52:19] you. Someone make you something you
[1:52:23] think you made yourself who you are.
[1:52:28] Let's
[1:52:33] repent. Amen. Amen. They're not going
[1:52:36] anywhere. Because for me to say, brother
[1:52:41] harvest has helped me. It's like I'm
[1:52:44] taking glory to
[1:52:46] him. You have a pride that is not taking
[1:52:48] you anywhere.
[1:52:51] If somebody has done good to you, you
[1:52:55] must thank him, you must thank God
[1:52:58] because God use a human being to save
[1:53:02] another human being. Brother said we are
[1:53:07] savior. We are saviors. We are
[1:53:12] saviors. We are redeemers.
[1:53:15] God made us to redeem the people. God
[1:53:20] made us to save the people because we
[1:53:23] are amate
[1:53:25] God. You You did not fall from the
[1:53:29] tree. God sent someone to tell you about
[1:53:34] the message. That's why you are here
[1:53:36] this morning. The Enoch of
[1:53:38] Ethia when he was reading the
[1:53:41] Bible, he couldn't understand. But God
[1:53:46] sent the man of God said to Philillip,
[1:53:48] "Go to him." He never prayed for
[1:53:52] Philillip. But God sent Philillip. I
[1:53:55] want to tell you brothers and sisters,
[1:53:57] you have done nothing good before God.
[1:54:01] God sent men of God to show you the way.
[1:54:05] We better appreciate that and appreciate
[1:54:08] God. We are not the inhabitants of this
[1:54:11] world.
[1:54:13] When Nebuchadnezzar was looking, the
[1:54:16] reason why he said to
[1:54:17] those you know he said all those
[1:54:21] charians you know the sorceress the
[1:54:23] magician and everything he said to them
[1:54:26] if you don't tell me what I dreamed
[1:54:29] about I kill all of you that thing is
[1:54:33] between life and
[1:54:34] death I must know if it take a life of
[1:54:38] human being for me to have the answer so
[1:54:42] be it but I will eliminate all of
[1:54:44] you. Amen. And they were very much
[1:54:48] honest. They said no man from
[1:54:52] underworld no man from the fifth
[1:54:55] dimension can tell you that because we
[1:54:58] are from underworld. We are from the
[1:55:01] fifth dimension. We do not have answer
[1:55:05] but we need a man that come from the
[1:55:07] seventh dimension. That is the man who
[1:55:10] can tell us the answer. No wonder Daniel
[1:55:14] stood up and said, "God has spoken to
[1:55:17] me. God has given me the answer. King,
[1:55:21] this is what you dream
[1:55:22] about. Blessed art thou for you have
[1:55:25] seen the beginning of the kingdom until
[1:55:29] the end of the earthly kingdom and you
[1:55:31] have seen eternity." Because when you
[1:55:34] see that stone becoming a big mountain,
[1:55:38] becoming a new city, becoming people
[1:55:40] staying in even outside, that was
[1:55:43] eternity. And he said to him, "Those
[1:55:46] that kingdom will stay
[1:55:49] forever. There were people walking in
[1:55:52] and out. There were people enjoying
[1:55:54] themselves. Who are those people? It's
[1:55:58] you. Nebuchadnezzar saw you. Daniel saw
[1:56:02] you and brother come and said to you I
[1:56:06] saw you
[1:56:09] there. When you live in this world, you
[1:56:14] just leave but you are living somewhere.
[1:56:17] The life that you live somewhere is
[1:56:19] influencing this
[1:56:23] one. Amen. Amen. Brother Abraham said to
[1:56:26] another
[1:56:28] woman, he looked at them and said, "Oh,
[1:56:32] I saw these people in her." But they
[1:56:36] were living, they were walking in an
[1:56:39] escalator. I want to tell you, even if
[1:56:42] he can preach
[1:56:44] hard, those people will never go to
[1:56:47] heaven.
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:54] Brother said, "I saw you. You are
[1:56:59] sinless. You are spotless. You are
[1:57:02] without wrinkle. When I saw you that
[1:57:04] side, you are perfect. But check how
[1:57:08] struggling you
[1:57:10] are. You don't have a job. You don't
[1:57:13] have money. Sometimes you think negative
[1:57:15] things. Sometimes you want to commit
[1:57:17] suicide. Sometimes you think why do I
[1:57:19] live for? Sometimes you think God can
[1:57:22] just take you. But when look at you, he
[1:57:26] look at you being a perfect being up
[1:57:30] there. And this body when it comes to an
[1:57:34] end, you just go in there. Look at
[1:57:37] Lazarus, you know, licking his own
[1:57:41] soul. Look at licking his own soul. Look
[1:57:45] at Lazaro. As rich as he was, you know,
[1:57:50] life turns like this. The one that
[1:57:53] suffered,
[1:57:55] the one that suffered was comforted. The
[1:57:59] one that think he lives in a comfort
[1:58:03] life, he was in danger. He was in tal.
[1:58:10] Amen. Even if when he's on the other
[1:58:12] side, he had the gut of saying, "Send
[1:58:16] Lazaro to my
[1:58:18] brothers." When he was here, he said
[1:58:22] to
[1:58:24] jump will say, "How
[1:58:26] hard. Wait until you get to
[1:58:29] heaven. Can you tell me that?" I won't
[1:58:32] say how hard.
[1:58:36] That time was here where the
[1:58:41] boss boo
[1:58:44] people thinking is the end of
[1:58:47] everything. Brothers and sisters, your
[1:58:50] money, your education, your good life,
[1:58:54] your big house, your cars are not taking
[1:58:58] you to heaven.
[1:59:00] And we do not
[1:59:02] measure the blessings, the
[1:59:06] prosperity based on that. If they are
[1:59:10] message
[1:59:12] believers, God has blessed them with
[1:59:15] those material, those that do not have,
[1:59:18] they do not worship enough. When we go
[1:59:21] out, stop that thing.
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:31] Amen. We know many men and women that
[1:59:35] were
[1:59:35] learned they've realized later that they
[1:59:39] could have
[1:59:40] just learned the
[1:59:43] Bible not the one in the
[1:59:45] university because the one in the
[1:59:48] university is temporal.
[1:59:56] I was looking at the document
[1:59:59] documentary.
[2:00:01] This man in the Titanic,
[2:00:05] that rich man, he said, "Let me give you
[2:00:10] money and give me a love boat so that I
[2:00:13] can be saved." Then this man said to
[2:00:16] him, "Money is not going to save us
[2:00:19] here.
[2:00:20] You, you and me are sinking now. The
[2:00:26] money is not going to save you. Your
[2:00:29] money was
[2:00:32] temporal. No wonder the Bible says the
[2:00:36] love of money is the root of
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:42] all. Let's get into the new
[2:00:45] city. In the new city, you
[2:00:49] welcome by someone by the name of Peter
[2:00:54] who cannot even write his name.
[2:01:01] The foundation of the new
[2:01:04] city, amen, is the 12
[2:01:07] apostles, the patent of Israel. When God
[2:01:11] said to the children of Israel, when you
[2:01:14] go in Egypt, in Babylon, in wherever
[2:01:20] they capture you, when they ask you,
[2:01:23] "What is your
[2:01:25] skill?" Just tell them, "We are
[2:01:28] shepherd." Okay.
[2:01:34] Don't tell them I'm a
[2:01:38] specialist psychiatrist. Psychiatrist.
[2:01:42] I've got I'm a professor in
[2:01:45] zoologology. Don't tell them. Just tell
[2:01:49] them I'm a
[2:01:50] shepherd and that's it. You're not a
[2:01:53] shepherd. Maybe it's because I I go to
[2:01:56] the suit every
[2:01:58] morning. Those people, they even smell
[2:02:01] like their
[2:02:02] [Music]
[2:02:05] sheep. But when we preach the message to
[2:02:08] them, putting those
[2:02:11] blankets, you just see them knotting
[2:02:13] their head. When when we
[2:02:16] leave, they just
[2:02:19] say, "I also want to be baptized.
[2:02:25] They've had a way for the pastor said
[2:02:28] you go and preach to the people that God
[2:02:32] has
[2:02:33] prepared and that's it. I don't need to
[2:02:36] pray hard. I don't need to stress
[2:02:38] myself. I remember the other day when we
[2:02:42] were in a place called
[2:02:44] Masatan, brother was baptizing the
[2:02:47] people. He was about to start. When he
[2:02:50] was about to start, four young men came
[2:03:00] running. We also went to the Lord
[2:03:04] here. I want you to pass because as you
[2:03:07] in a rush, those
[2:03:10] boys, we also came to be to be baptized.
[2:03:17] God is calling his children
[2:03:20] from all over.
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:25] There is a
[2:03:27] city that we are going to the new city
[2:03:31] doesn't need our
[2:03:34] intelligence but it needs the internal
[2:03:39] intelligence that eternal
[2:03:43] intelligence that's what we need.
[2:03:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:49] I'm reading from the future
[2:03:51] home in spoken word. Amen. Brother says,
[2:03:56] "Why is it God so thought and cared so
[2:03:59] much about that little place called
[2:04:07] Palestine? See, when it's just a little
[2:04:10] spot, but right in
[2:04:13] there is where the temple is set.
[2:04:18] That's where the new Jerusalem will
[2:04:23] break. Then olive, mount olive shall
[2:04:28] cleave part to the right and the
[2:04:33] left. This way go that
[2:04:36] way. The other one this way. When she
[2:04:40] pushes
[2:04:42] up from beneath, he's calling about the
[2:04:45] city.
[2:04:47] No, not they say pushing apart like
[2:04:50] this but pushing up after Mount
[2:04:55] Olive give way there's some
[2:04:58] push in that day when it stand his holy
[2:05:04] feet upon the
[2:05:06] mountain on this
[2:05:09] throne 1500
[2:05:14] miles 1500 miles. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:05:18] Brother said the other day, you were
[2:05:21] there when I was preaching to you
[2:05:24] telling you that I was measuring that
[2:05:29] thing. When brother Bren, brother uh
[2:05:33] when brother
[2:05:35] Nebuchadnezzar dream about the thing and
[2:05:38] brother Daniel interpret the theme, they
[2:05:41] saw
[2:05:43] brother me in the sea.
[2:05:47] John saw brother Brennan measuring the
[2:05:50] seeds.
[2:05:53] Let me tell you this. I don't know if I
[2:05:56] will be
[2:05:57] clear. You will understand it or
[2:06:00] not. When you try to catch things of
[2:06:03] heaven
[2:06:06] imaginary, you get lost.
[2:06:11] You just need to
[2:06:12] believe and know that God is in
[2:06:17] work. When brother Brenham was here on
[2:06:21] earth preaching the message living a
[2:06:24] normal life like
[2:06:25] everyone. Do you understand but his
[2:06:29] theophan was measuring the seed.
[2:06:34] look at him and he said the only person
[2:06:38] that can measure the seed and give me
[2:06:41] the answer is the Lord Jesus
[2:06:44] Christ. For the lamb is worthy to
[2:06:48] measure the city. The lamb is worthy you
[2:06:53] know to break the
[2:06:54] seals. One of the days brother Brham
[2:06:58] said you heard me when I say I measured
[2:07:01] the seal. brotherham the other day said
[2:07:05] I'm here this morning Sunday morning to
[2:07:09] open the
[2:07:11] seal for
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:17] God I've seen people in
[2:07:19] Congo yeah they woriing
[2:07:23] brother they have the photo of
[2:07:26] brother they say this man if he's the
[2:07:29] one that opened the seal for the lamb.
[2:07:33] That means he's God. They worship
[2:07:38] brother right there in Congo. Amen.
[2:07:43] But brother Brenham
[2:07:46] said to John, "Bow not. I'm just one of
[2:07:52] you." Amen. Amen. I don't blame
[2:07:56] John. I don't blame the poor
[2:08:00] congalles. God want to reveal to them,
[2:08:03] he will reveal to them. But leave a
[2:08:06] message until the people want to worship
[2:08:10] you thinking you are God because they
[2:08:13] see the characteristics of God in
[2:08:19] you. You will be the one that say I'm
[2:08:23] just one of them. I am not God. But when
[2:08:26] they look at you, they see God. You talk
[2:08:30] like God. You walk like God until they
[2:08:33] say you are
[2:08:35] God. When brother heard them say that,
[2:08:39] he said to them,
[2:08:41] "Anyway, you are not far from the tree.
[2:08:44] A son of God is God. A son of chicken is
[2:08:48] a chicken of lamb is a lamb. Sheep is a
[2:08:52] lamb. A son of God is God. I am God." We
[2:08:57] are in the state of
[2:09:01] Adam. When Adam was in the garden of
[2:09:04] Eden, he had a control of
[2:09:07] everything. Amen. Everything comes under
[2:09:11] his subjection because he had
[2:09:14] authority. The only person that had
[2:09:18] authority is God himself. If he's God
[2:09:21] himself, we see the characteristics of
[2:09:23] him in a man.
[2:09:25] Oh God whom we worship is in this man
[2:09:31] then we shall follow this man.
[2:09:35] Amen. As the other people out there not
[2:09:39] always I have
[2:09:41] answer. Amen. Amen. They say you
[2:09:45] murals worship your pastor. Then I said
[2:09:48] to them you are not far from the truth.
[2:09:51] It happens to brother Brenham. Brother,
[2:09:56] I'm telling you this. Amen. If you
[2:09:59] follow a man of God, you end up being
[2:10:04] the beneficiary of what you
[2:10:09] follow. Let's not I I was telling the
[2:10:13] other message
[2:10:14] believers said, "Amen." I was telling to
[2:10:18] them you
[2:10:19] brothers you read
[2:10:22] Bible reverse what you start to read it
[2:10:27] right. Amen. Amen. The very same things
[2:10:31] that you believed you
[2:10:34] disbelieved. When
[2:10:36] Elijah saw what others couldn't
[2:10:41] see. What was that? It was God who
[2:10:46] chose him to see those
[2:10:51] things. Amen.
[2:10:53] And one day
[2:10:56] Elisha said to God, I see this thing
[2:10:59] alone. The people do not believe. Can
[2:11:03] you just show the young man as
[2:11:05] well? Amen. Amen. And then God showed
[2:11:09] the young man the unseen.
[2:11:13] He started to realize from that day, am
[2:11:16] I so
[2:11:18] protected from the host of
[2:11:21] heaven? The whole host of
[2:11:24] heaven. If someone can touch us or try
[2:11:29] to touch us, he will be eliminated
[2:11:34] immediately. From that day, that young
[2:11:37] man that
[2:11:39] was never the same
[2:11:41] again. He walked with
[2:11:44] confidence. You know if God one day can
[2:11:47] show you the real you on the other side,
[2:11:52] brother I have money or no
[2:11:54] money. Let them
[2:11:56] go. I will even give to the people. Take
[2:12:01] because the real me is up there. I'm
[2:12:05] longing to be up there. I'm longing to
[2:12:08] be in the new city.
[2:12:10] This thing happens to Paul again because
[2:12:13] Paul saw himself on the other side when
[2:12:17] he see himself on the took him 14
[2:12:21] years. He was just quiet. He was just
[2:12:24] walking. He was just preaching. It's
[2:12:28] like but no way. If I can tell these
[2:12:30] people they will never understand.
[2:12:36] after 14
[2:12:38] years my
[2:12:43] brothers they said
[2:12:45] what you see me here another Paul that
[2:12:49] is
[2:12:50] young who can see who is complete I saw
[2:12:58] him you know what the people will always
[2:13:04] react my will just pray for
[2:13:07] you because you really see things that
[2:13:10] are not
[2:13:11] seen and those things they don't even
[2:13:13] have God with
[2:13:15] him because you saw something that other
[2:13:18] people can't see. Sister, if you see the
[2:13:21] unseen hold to death, it's God who
[2:13:24] allowed them. If I don't see, I was not
[2:13:28] meant to see. If the others see, they
[2:13:31] meant to see what's wrong with them.
[2:13:34] Amen.
[2:13:35] Do you think do you know that the people
[2:13:37] that are met think you thinking you are
[2:13:39] normal you
[2:13:47] are met this man was met was eating in
[2:13:52] the
[2:13:53] dust he was preach the
[2:13:55] message the message he came to the
[2:13:58] church they give him suit they bath him
[2:14:02] he was a nice brother but one Hey, they
[2:14:04] found him eating the dust again. And he
[2:14:07] said to them, "This clean life of
[2:14:10] wearing tie and shoes, it's not for me.
[2:14:13] I'm enjoying here. What are you going to
[2:14:15] do with that person? You think you are
[2:14:18] mad while you think he is
[2:14:22] mad?" There are
[2:14:24] situation that you cannot change
[2:14:26] it. Everything that is happening, it has
[2:14:31] happened.
[2:14:33] Let me repeat
[2:14:34] myself. Everything that is happening has
[2:14:39] happened. They were like in a
[2:14:44] cage. They were in a plan of God. At the
[2:14:48] right time, God open and say, Adam, you
[2:14:54] start the race. Enoch, you will be the
[2:14:58] seven. Adam, you will leave your land.
[2:15:02] You will
[2:15:03] go and stand where I God will bring my
[2:15:09] new
[2:15:10] city. That is why when we sing, we sing
[2:15:15] about Abraham that he was looking for a
[2:15:19] city. When he was looking for a seed, he
[2:15:23] was going north, south, east, and west.
[2:15:27] But one day when he was walking, God was
[2:15:31] calling him. When he stopped, he met
[2:15:35] me, the king of that sea. When he met
[2:15:39] him, he said to Abraham, "Here is the
[2:15:43] holy place." Here, that's where the holy
[2:15:46] seat will come. Like you, blessed thou
[2:15:51] to meet me at the place called the
[2:15:55] future eternal.
[2:16:01] Amen. Amen. There are people that
[2:16:04] already have seen themselves beyond the
[2:16:07] kitten of
[2:16:08] time. You will look at their life. You
[2:16:11] look how they do things. You will see
[2:16:14] the things of this world. They are no
[2:16:16] longer holding them back because they've
[2:16:20] seen
[2:16:21] themselves beyond the c of time. The new
[2:16:27] city is the city
[2:16:31] eternal. Who do you think when was
[2:16:35] looking? He was looking at the people
[2:16:38] going out going in the in the gates
[2:16:42] coming out. When you close your eyes and
[2:16:45] imagine who are those
[2:16:47] people, you think it's the people you
[2:16:49] don't know.
[2:16:51] is the people you know and you are one
[2:16:54] of
[2:16:56] them saw you. Daniel saw you brother.
[2:17:01] That is why we are
[2:17:03] worshiping whom we
[2:17:07] [Applause]
[2:17:09] know. You know if you can worship in
[2:17:11] that
[2:17:12] way no one can do anything.
[2:17:16] Amen. Amen.
[2:17:19] Chapter 22.
[2:17:22] Revelation 22 is my last scripture.
[2:17:27] Oh, let me Yeah. Uh I was talking to the
[2:17:30] brothers. The message is 1
[2:17:34] hour. Just few minutes I'm
[2:17:38] closing. Uh
[2:17:41] verse not 14. Yes. Verse 14. Revelation
[2:17:46] 22:14. And you jump to 17, 14, and 17.
[2:17:51] Amen. Blessed are they that do his
[2:17:53] commandments, that they may have right
[2:17:55] to the tree of life, and may enter in
[2:17:58] through the gates into the city. 17 And
[2:18:02] the spirit and the bride say, come, and
[2:18:05] let him that heareth say, come, and let
[2:18:08] him that is a thirst come. And whosoever
[2:18:12] will, let him take the water of life
[2:18:15] freely. Amen. Amen. Revelation chapter
[2:18:20] 22 closes
[2:18:22] everything is the end of everything.
[2:18:25] That's why even the Bible says those
[2:18:27] that do evil
[2:18:30] deeds continue. Amen. Why the Bible
[2:18:34] don't
[2:18:35] say those that do evil
[2:18:39] deeds must
[2:18:41] repent? Time of
[2:18:43] repentance is gone.
[2:18:51] Can I repeat myself?
[2:18:54] Those that do good continue. Those that
[2:18:58] do
[2:18:59] bad
[2:19:01] continue time of
[2:19:03] repentance is
[2:19:05] gone. Let me go back to my scripture.
[2:19:09] Blessed are you that do his commandments
[2:19:13] that you may have the right to the tree
[2:19:17] of life. The tree of life is Christ
[2:19:21] Jesus. The only people that have the
[2:19:25] access to the tree of life is the
[2:19:31] bride. Brother said there was a flaming
[2:19:35] sword that stopped the
[2:19:37] people to
[2:19:39] partake in the garden of Eden. But the
[2:19:43] flaming sword when the man of God was
[2:19:46] praying fell in his head and the word
[2:19:50] says this is the sword of the king. The
[2:19:54] one that stopped the people from
[2:19:57] entering is the one that will bring them
[2:20:00] in.
[2:20:03] the sword. That's why the word of God
[2:20:06] Bible
[2:20:08] says it can save.
[2:20:12] While it kills others, it saved others.
[2:20:16] I'm not talking about history. I'm
[2:20:20] talking about what is happening today.
[2:20:24] If you decide to leave this
[2:20:27] church, this sermon that I'm preaching
[2:20:30] even if can be wonderful sermon cannot
[2:20:33] stop
[2:20:35] you from going. No, you will go. I
[2:20:40] remember sometimes back those that are
[2:20:43] old will know what I'm talking
[2:20:45] about. Amen. The brother was coming
[2:20:49] here with a letter of leaving the church
[2:20:54] writing to the pastor and then he was
[2:20:56] rendering an
[2:21:00] item. He was so
[2:21:02] happy after the service after we are
[2:21:06] happy. Enjoy the message he was handing
[2:21:10] in the
[2:21:11] land. The message is not going to change
[2:21:15] you. This one I repeat it many times.
[2:21:18] The message can be
[2:21:20] wonderful. It's not going to change you.
[2:21:24] The way you are is the way you will
[2:21:32] be. Who are you for the message to
[2:21:36] change you? by God
[2:21:38] himself to Cain. God the creator of
[2:21:43] heaven and earth said to Cain, "Kain,
[2:21:46] you don't need to pray hard. You don't
[2:21:48] need to do anything funny. Just do like
[2:21:52] unto your
[2:21:53] brother." That was the message of the
[2:21:55] day. That was the ministry of the time.
[2:21:59] Do like unto your
[2:22:01] brother. You shall be
[2:22:03] received. But I'm not a brother's
[2:22:05] keeper.
[2:22:07] The only person I remember who uttered
[2:22:10] those words is the devil
[2:22:14] himself. I'm not my brother's keeper.
[2:22:17] Amen. Then he killed even after hearing
[2:22:21] the word of God. He
[2:22:25] killed. Who are you this morning after
[2:22:29] hearing a wonderful message and still
[2:22:33] hold you back?
[2:22:37] Brothers and sisters, if there's time to
[2:22:40] go, if there is time to go, you will go.
[2:22:48] Amen. Amen. Jesus said to Judas,
[2:22:52] Judas, Judas, is the time and the time
[2:22:55] is now. Try
[2:23:06] help you.
[2:23:10] He even look at the others. You can live
[2:23:13] as well.
[2:23:16] Amen. Amen. But one man said, "Whom
[2:23:19] shall we go? For the word of life are in
[2:23:23] you." And then Jesus said to me,
[2:23:26] "Blessed art thou."
[2:23:30] Amen.
[2:23:32] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:35] Brother Luke
[2:23:37] having the PhD
[2:23:40] but God did not give him the key. I'm
[2:23:43] not taking the
[2:23:45] PhD but he gave them to
[2:23:48] Peter whom cannot
[2:23:57] sign the church that I'm taking your
[2:24:00] PhD I'm just saying during that time the
[2:24:06] the the
[2:24:07] disciples they were
[2:24:09] doctors they were at they text. They
[2:24:14] were accountants. They were learned
[2:24:16] people. And God loved them so much. But
[2:24:19] he just took the keys of heaven. He said
[2:24:23] taxpayers, accountants, lawyers,
[2:24:27] physicians, this man will open for you.
[2:24:31] Our God is
[2:24:35] good. Amen. Hey, let me stop here. God
[2:24:39] bless you all.
[2:24:48] Let's sing unto the Lord.
[2:24:55] Amen. Amen. Let's sing a hymn.

[2:40:00] Amen. Acts 2 from verse 36 to
[2:40:04] 39. Therefore, let all the house of
[2:40:07] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[2:40:10] that same Jesus whom he have crucified
[2:40:14] both Lord and Christ. Now when they
[2:40:16] heard this, they were pricricked in
[2:40:18] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[2:40:21] the rest of the apostles, "Men and
[2:40:23] brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter
[2:40:26] said unto them, "Repent, and be
[2:40:28] baptized, every one of you, in the name
[2:40:30] of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
[2:40:33] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:40:35] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[2:40:38] you and to your children and to all that

[2:40:44] our God shall
[2:40:47] call. God bless
