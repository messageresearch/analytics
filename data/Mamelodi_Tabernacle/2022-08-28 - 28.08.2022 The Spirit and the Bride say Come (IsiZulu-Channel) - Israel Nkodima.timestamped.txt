[50:43] it was more than 500 people as the
[50:45] prophet says
[50:48] everybody was touching the lord jesus
[50:51] but
[50:52] the touch of that woman
[50:54] drew virtue out of
[50:56] the lord jesus
[50:58] so the prophet says today is not about

[51:02] but you can touch
[51:04] the lord by faith
[51:06] hallelujah so if you have a desire in
