[1:08] Lord Jesus Christ this evening
[1:16] um
[1:17] it's very very cold

[1:27] foreign
[1:31] [Music]
[1:38] so great I see that is seen as done
[1:41] the one that's without
[1:44] them okay
[1:49] we thank the Lord for another
[1:51] opportunity
[1:53] and I'm good I'm just going to
[1:58] present something for to uh
[2:02] lay a carpet for tomorrow and this is
[2:14] sir I'm conscious of the conditions we
[2:19] have elderly people among us and this is
[2:27] now I just want to put some encouraging
[2:31] them also that we want prolong the
[2:34] service
[2:38] but let all the according to his will
[2:46] and if there will be a tomorrow then
[2:49] what we are going to read for some few
[2:51] minutes that will
[2:54] uh prepare us for tomorrow if there will
[2:57] be a tomorrow in the Lord foreign
[3:22] and after the prophet has preached
[3:27] we cannot start something else
[3:33] because when he left
[3:36] he said what
[3:38] dude he said here is the secret I'm
[3:42] going to read it tomorrow
[3:46] the weight is in the bride it is
[3:50] amen because a messenger is somebody who
[3:54] is sent with a message
[3:59] to deliver it
[4:03] and after
[4:06] uh Elias delivered the message to
[4:10] Rebecca
[4:11] is
[4:15] so they started together with Rebecca
[4:18] following Elias
[4:27] Isaac
[4:32] when they arrived for Isaac was
[4:35] foreign
[4:51] you know and
[4:53] marriage started in the garden and yeah
[4:59] when God separated the woman from the
[5:03] men it was in the garden
[5:06] um
[5:08] and we see the Lord doing the same thing
[5:11] with Rebecca and Isaac because Isaac was
[5:15] in the field yes when
[5:23] when Rebecca saw Isaac Isaac was
[5:26] meditating in the field
[5:33] and when
[5:35] Elias are picked up
[5:38] Rebecca it was in the evening
[5:46] so with types the whole thing amen
[5:52] so now that's why now
[5:54] Rebecca
[5:56] was led to Isaac
[6:02] and
[6:04] Isaac
[6:06] eliasa could not leave Rebecca until
[6:10] Rebecca saw Isaac yes
[6:18] a man so brother Brennan our Alias
[6:23] away he came with the bride
[6:27] until he said whatever
[6:31] when he said senses this is the time
[6:37] at the time
[6:47] and said Christ The Mystery of God
[6:50] revealed
[6:54] and when
[6:56] the bride saw that
[6:59] not the church
[7:03] when the bride saw that
[7:05] um
[7:09] God took him
[7:11] because the message
[7:14] was now in the bridge
[7:18] so a messenger
[7:21] brings the message to the bride
[7:26] he won't
[7:28] live until they miss that message is in
[7:32] the bright
[7:38] now let's turn to a description again
[7:43] we are just online yes to send the name
[7:47] until tomorrow uh
[7:50] after we will be going after these
[7:53] golden nuggets
[7:58] we want to worship

[8:44] ourselves
[8:50] God was found in his in the temple
[8:56] and he says
[9:01] is the place where God has a place God
[9:06] has has chosen
[9:08] he fell from
[9:12] porn to place his throne
[9:16] amen amen
[9:20] and tomorrow if
[9:24] tomorrow the Lord willing
[9:26] [Music]
[9:29] I want we we will look at the third
[9:32] Throne mystery says
[9:38] where God is
[9:46] we don't want to worship or a God who is
[9:49] in somebody else and he is not in us
[9:56] we don't want to worship the god of
[9:59] somebody else
[10:02] we want to worship God that is in US
[10:15] let us pray for the reading of the way
[10:19] Heavenly Father we are so thankful under
[10:22] this trying conditions amen but yet
[10:26] father you allowed it to be the way it
[10:28] is amen knowing that your people will
[10:31] still yet come and sit here yeah and
[10:34] listen to the word that you have
[10:37] promised them in these last days amen
[10:40] father just keep them warm father and we
[10:46] believe that what you are what is in
[10:49] store for us right now was prepared for
[10:54] us for this time amen and we believe it
[10:57] will put something in our hearts that
[11:00] will put this coldness out of our
[11:05] physical
[11:06] yeah I pray father that God will help us
[11:09] and I heal the people as we are here for
[11:13] and the brother Branham says the word of
[11:17] God Is A Healer amen and I've seen many
[11:21] people getting healed just by receiving
[11:23] the word from the pulpit rather than
[11:26] coming on a prayer line yes I pray
[11:30] father that you'll bless our people
[11:33] Bless The Messengers that are here the
[11:37] people we have put responsibility amen
[11:39] upon that they will preach the word in
[11:43] this area and elsewhere and abroad yes
[11:48] and we believe further that the devil is
[11:50] against this Revelation yes of God of
[11:55] the seventh seal amen but we believe
[11:57] father that is been like that even in
[12:00] the beginning from the beginning amen
[12:03] and I pray father that will bless us and
[12:06] heal us as we pray in Jesus Christ's
[12:09] name amen amen let's just open Ephesians
[12:13] chapter
[12:15] 1 verse
[12:18] foreign
[12:35] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[12:38] of times he might maybe start from verse
[12:41] 9 if if
[12:43] possible
[12:44] having made known unto us the mystery of
[12:48] his will according to his good pleasure
[12:51] which he had
[12:53] peoples in himself
[12:56] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[12:59] of time he might gather together in one
[13:03] all things in Christ
[13:06] both which are in heaven and which are
[13:10] on Earth
[13:11] even in him
[13:14] from there foreign
[13:56] you may be seated God bless you
[14:00] we will just put uh
[14:03] to the same message a text
[14:06] yes
[14:12] our text will be the last sign all right
[14:21] as it says
[14:23] he will put now together
[14:28] you know this morning we've seen God and
[14:31] men were one day and God and men one
[14:35] here
[14:41] the whole thing because in the Garden of
[14:44] Eden what the enemy did was to separate
[14:49] men from a union with God is
[15:00] so that men would be
[15:03] conscious of the existence of God but
[15:07] without any Union
[15:16] as I'm listening to the Servants of God
[15:20] here is that they are talking of a God
[15:25] who should be in you
[15:27] foreign
[15:38] uh in the book the inner Veil
[15:46] he says
[15:50] he does he is not waiting for another uh
[15:56] Revival
[16:02] if I could I could code it very well but
[16:07] he says
[16:09] it is Sunday to Sunday
[16:16] meaning God is in him
[16:20] Sunday to Sunday
[16:24] amen amen so you don't wait for him on
[16:28] Sunday
[16:31] first day to the first day
[16:36] okay amen now I will look at it we are
[16:41] still having the same preaching we are
[16:44] still on the same line I
[16:47] [Music]
[16:49] I want to read one part here
[16:54] at the dispensation of time he will
[16:58] bring together
[17:00] what's in heaven and on Earth together
[17:10] amen
[17:11] so
[17:13] men would no longer look up to heaven
[17:16] for something
[17:19] because
[17:21] all that was hidden in heaven will be
[17:24] together with that's on Earth
[17:30] amen
[17:41] so as it was God
[17:45] and we were all in him
[17:48] at the end he shall again put together
[17:54] because we were together amen
[17:58] [Music]
[18:01] so God just processed us
[18:04] as attributes
[18:07] and to shine forth
[18:10] as they reflectors
[18:14] to give light the who can reflect
[18:18] the reflection which is God
[18:22] that's what he has a a brought us here
[18:26] for you
[18:28] a God didn't bring us to Earth to suffer
[18:34] he brought us to to the Earth
[18:39] to shine forth
[18:43] as the Stars
[18:47] you know I I always repeat the same
[18:50] thing that when God
[18:52] after I created things he wanted
[18:55] somebody to appreciate
[19:01] um
[19:02] God wanted to express himself
[19:08] he he wanted to spread himself
[19:12] so that day he he is there all and in in
[19:17] all as the Bible says
[19:20] he wanted to be in a flower in a bed
[19:25] he wanted every living thing to express
[19:29] him
[19:35] saw each one of us
[19:39] should they have him in his heart
[19:45] that's why now
[19:46] the expression is when one says it is
[19:50] revealed the other one says amen
[19:57] so it's just an expression of who he is
[20:03] because you know today to us
[20:07] he is this one
[20:12] he is the one who this is uh you know
[20:15] I'm gonna call things you know and we
[20:24] are amen I wish you we could speak about
[20:26] that
[20:29] even in time
[20:33] that is Page 41 years
[20:36] he is the one who opened those seals
[20:42] he is those seals
[20:47] amen
[20:48] amen so which which one are you talking
[20:51] of today
[20:56] you're talking about Jesus yes which one
[21:00] now we're talking about Christ today yes
[21:04] because of Christ
[21:07] was in the body called Jesus
[21:11] which is the temple of God
[21:15] Jesus
[21:16] amen amen you know
[21:20] um I was somewhere abroad
[21:23] the question was like this
[21:29] The Book of Mark 13.
[21:33] while holding on this let me just quote
[21:36] it here because
[21:38] I'm talking to the Seed of Abraham
[21:44] amen amen so
[21:48] God said of Abraham
[21:51] shall I hide
[21:53] anything from Abraham
[21:56] amen God cannot hide
[22:01] this secret to you
[22:06] I don't want a god whom
[22:11] who will make me to doubt some other
[22:14] things
[22:18] it is a revealed or not
[22:23] amen I won't worship such a God
[22:26] I worship a God who comes and reveals
[22:31] himself
[22:33] amen amen amen
[22:36] not the one who will put some questions
[22:39] and answers in me why also begging me
[22:42] boss
[22:45] so then I will keep on waiting for
[22:47] somebody to deceive me
[22:51] The Book of Mark
[23:01] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[23:04] words shall not pass away
[23:11] but of that day and that our North new
[23:15] men
[23:19] no not the Angels who are in heaven
[23:24] neither the son but the father
[23:30] now the question was he is
[23:34] the question is
[23:36] the Bible says the Bible even the son
[23:40] don't know
[23:43] [Music]
[23:44] let me I want to thank God
[23:47] amen who revealed these things to us
[23:52] even the son don't know
[23:58] you know
[24:00] if it it cuts up in a mind of a canal
[24:04] man
[24:08] keep on saying yeah even the son don't
[24:11] know
[24:13] without any answer
[24:17] uh just like God that Brenham says God
[24:23] opened the seventh and said nothing
[24:28] now should it drop in the canal mind in
[24:32] a way
[24:33] he will even rejoice it that no nobody
[24:36] knows
[24:42] let me read it to you brother Branham
[24:45] says
[24:46] God said nothing amen
[24:54] so it ends up there God said
[25:00] okay amen then I asked him yes God said
[25:03] nothing
[25:06] himself
[25:08] but he said something amen
[25:14] amen he God spoke through brother
[25:19] so that if you are trying to listen up
[25:22] there
[25:24] God says
[25:27] You must you must come down
[25:31] to the man
[25:37] amen amen and then you'll hear something
[25:41] because God now has spoken through this
[25:45] one
[25:48] amen so if you need the spokesman of God
[25:54] if there's a king
[25:57] and then sometimes you go there you want
[26:00] to talk to the king or you want to hear
[26:02] from the King okay
[26:06] they'll tell you that you see the
[26:09] spokesman of the king is
[26:13] [Applause]
[26:14] the spokesman of the king
[26:18] he will take from the King
[26:23] amen amen so you can't say
[26:26] the king said nothing um
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:33] you'll be arrested
[26:37] amen because the King has spoken through
[26:39] his spokesman
[26:43] now to say the King has said nothing is
[26:47] under to undermine the king
[26:50] amen
[26:55] all right
[26:57] amen meaning that
[27:00] don't try to listen from thinking you'll
[27:04] get it from update
[27:07] you should receive it from this one yeah
[27:11] [Applause]
[27:14] because that one has posted it to this
[27:18] one
[27:22] so he has posted it from himself to Adam
[27:29] what did God say
[27:32] go to Adam
[27:35] [Applause]
[27:37] all right amen amen this is your seventh
[27:40] seal uh
[27:45] amen okay now here I am I need something
[27:49] here
[27:51] um
[27:52] we we write efficiency uh
[27:59] okay I think I was looking for this one
[28:02] elsewhere here
[28:04] before we go back to this let's read
[28:07] this one
[28:09] he is the one who opened those cells
[28:14] now remember
[28:16] he opened the seals
[28:20] and he said nothing he just he just
[28:24] opened
[28:26] after opening did you hear him saying
[28:29] something and then
[28:32] no
[28:34] but
[28:35] you've got this book here
[28:38] containing what he has said amen
[28:45] foreign
[29:21] amen but when when it was in his and it
[29:26] was not in the form of a book like this
[29:30] that was the Revelation he kept
[29:36] the right hand means the Majesty is
[29:47] well after he has given it to the Man
[29:52] they need materialized into a book form
[29:54] like this
[29:58] okay amen and he is those seals
[30:04] for the whole word of God is Christ
[30:09] amen not not a sermon but the whole
[30:12] world
[30:16] is Christ
[30:19] it's very a difference to from hearing
[30:25] from God the word of God or a sermon
[30:28] preached by Amen to
[30:47] they preach Christ
[30:52] amen not not just as someone
[30:56] Paul says I preach Christ
[31:02] amen
[31:04] and it says it and Christ is the seals
[31:09] that was opened oh
[31:15] amen
[31:17] who is he today
[31:19] um
[31:20] that were opened
[31:26] now can he be success
[31:30] we are not preaching Christ
[31:34] you are preaching amen
[31:36] but because he is not the six years
[31:41] he is the Seven Seals that were revealed
[31:48] amen oh my God that's why we can't be
[31:51] confused
[31:55] amen
[32:10] was to reveal Christ
[32:13] where is our our
[32:16] gay
[32:19] all right amen why the prophet speaks of
[32:23] Christ the mystery Christ
[32:28] he doesn't say Jesus the mystery
[32:31] but Christ who Christ because we we're
[32:36] going back yes God
[32:47] he was like a rainbow
[32:52] then he condescended into theophany is
[33:09] or you say
[33:36] it's the beginning of he says it is the
[33:39] beginning of the creation
[33:43] he says when you look at the theophany
[33:49] in the form of a man
[33:51] [Applause]
[33:56] it was not yet flesh
[34:01] it was the word in the form of amenities
[34:08] when Moses saw him
[34:12] so this history
[34:18] and it looked like a man
[34:23] amen when you die when you die it is
[34:27] this body that dies
[34:29] and the Bible says
[34:31] we shall change from mortality to
[34:36] immortality benef
[34:51] [Music]
[35:03] the body that can't eat
[35:06] um
[35:08] can't touch
[35:10] it it is in a body form water
[35:16] which was
[35:19] the beginning
[35:22] of the creation
[35:25] amen this was the format
[35:30] we we we we we we
[35:32] were shown how a book The spoken note
[35:36] was made in Congo
[35:39] now it comes
[35:42] a format
[35:45] a format
[35:47] before
[35:49] it comes out in a book
[35:57] amen
[35:59] everything comes through a certain
[36:01] format
[36:05] even with our tips
[36:10] some of them would not play through a
[36:13] certain system because of a different
[36:16] format yeah
[36:21] just like we as we are
[36:24] you are made differently
[36:29] you can play
[36:31] the seven seal is not revealed to a
[36:34] certain machine
[36:37] [Music]
[36:39] amen amen but you can't play that
[36:43] through a certain format
[36:46] a certain machine I think
[36:56] if I come with it is not revealed
[37:00] candies
[37:02] yeah
[37:03] you won't accept me I'll show you
[37:07] because
[37:08] it's another type of performance
[37:11] it was not made for this machine yes
[37:19] and we end up again
[37:22] it is like this
[37:26] uh yeah I come to men again
[37:32] awkward
[37:35] and the makeup will be but
[37:38] now listen my medicine it says it
[37:44] Here We call we shall say it's heaven
[37:48] when God dwells
[37:51] and here is
[37:55] now we must know that
[37:59] uh
[38:01] the Earth
[38:02] is not the world
[38:07] amen okay
[38:09] let me look at it yeah
[38:13] uh both which are in heaven and which
[38:17] are on earth
[38:21] now it doesn't say in the world
[38:25] because the world is a
[38:28] systematic and the Earth is the Earth
[38:34] amen amen I'm standing here on the Earth
[38:52] this political systems
[38:55] but now it is the earth
[38:59] now when God brought down Adam
[39:04] the spirit
[39:06] um he brought that Spirit into the Earth
[39:09] Down to Earth
[39:14] because Adam was
[39:16] Adam
[39:18] part of the earth
[39:22] you read the future room
[39:25] it tells you that
[39:27] Jesus was part of the earth oh yes
[39:33] oh man I I I can find it for you yeah
[39:36] Jesus was part of the earth
[39:39] and you also are you are part of the
[39:42] Earth
[39:44] that is your your body
[39:46] now it says it
[39:49] uh the seventh seal if you understand
[39:53] brings him
[39:57] brings him
[40:00] which all right let's go back to this
[40:06] the party
[40:08] You Came the reason you be we be we were
[40:12] born Sinners he says
[40:15] because we have bypassed this place
[40:21] God brought us down to the Earth
[40:26] to be tested and
[40:31] amen amen but now at the end of time
[40:36] he brings
[40:39] Christ who Christ to the Earth
[40:46] amen
[40:48] Jesus Oh yes
[40:53] okay amen
[40:55] the god the man the body of God
[40:59] Jesus is the body of God oh yes
[41:06] the god whom you seek Lord take on him
[41:09] shall come to his Temple
