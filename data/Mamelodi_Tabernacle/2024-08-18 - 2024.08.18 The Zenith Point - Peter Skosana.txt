Description:
Title: The Zenith Point
Text: Point of Interest
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 18 August 2024

Joel 2: 28 | Romans 1:17 | Matthew 4: 1-5 & 11- | Matthew 5:1 | Genesis 13:14-17 | Galatians 3:16 | Genesis 18: 16-18 & 22-24 | Deuteronomy 34:1-4 | Hebrews 13: 5,7 & 17 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience that we are at the Zenith Point where we are able to see all thing.


The seventh seal is the highest point; it is the zenith. When you are standing at the highest point you can see the past, the present time and the future. When you are at the highest point you are able to see eternity.

Each sermon has a purpose and it must take you a step further. When the word goes out of His mouth it shall not return void.

When you worship God you must know where you are. What we need now is the rapturing faith and the rapturing faith is the seventh seal.  Rapturing faith is Christ Himself, and Christ Himself is the word Himself, and the Word Himself is God Himself who is in you right now.

These things come through revelation, you cannot preach them to a person. The word of God you receive it by faith and not by understanding. Your perfection is your zenith. When a perfect God descent He descents upon a perfect person.  

The seventh seal has got power which is called the third pull. The word is in the bride, she has thus saith the Lord and she know what to with the word. If you do not have thus saith the Lord, you must ask yourself a question. You must always be able to place yourself.

The devil gages his time by us, the nearer the rapture comes he knows that the quicker he will go to the lake of fire. 

You cannot find a crown without fighting, and you cannot be called an overcomer without fighting and winning the battle. Your spiritual life is from eternity to eternity and there will be no obstacle on the way of your Christian life.

Anyone who is tempting you he is tempting the spirit in you. You as the bride you can challenge Sata...

Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions okay shall we bow our heads gracious Lord we are together again Lord as your children to come Lord and worship you and we are bringing in Lord our in our hearts our hearts and our souls gracious Lord that this very day father you undertake for us we are so grateful Lord and honored to be honored by you and to be recognized by you and to be called your bride amen there are so many people Lord Almighty as the word says that have the Zeal and wish that they could see these things but it's hidden from the wise and prudent and you just open it and reveal it to us father especially at the end timeall as we are gathered here Lord we pray father that your presence should be with us amen there was a time when Joshua said those words Lord he said the very anointing that was with Moses let it be with him we know Lord Almighty that behind this P Pulpit it's for the pastor we are just standing in the Gap amen we pray that the anointing that you gave him let it also be upon us us Lord amen and also be upon the church so that Lord at the end of our service we should see your mercy and Grace Lord am may you take control Lord Almighty of the the very scripture that we read may you be the one that will expand it Lord amen that it reach the cause father we are so thankful for what you have done unto us we always Lord Almighty wrestled with some spirits of the devil and his angels but father the promise that you gave us was that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail amen and when he comes in like a flood you always raise a standard so even today Father we are aware of your standard yes and we are aware of the Church of which the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen father thank you Lord than may your wishes Lord be fulfilled this morning am in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated God bless you okay my my title is is the Zen Point Zen Point Zen it means the highest the highest point maybe you'll check it it's z z e n [Music] zenth yeah is the we are living at the last days and then that will be my title this morning I will I will explain it before I I continue and then the text text will be the point of Interest the things that will interest us but while we are aiming at the Zen uh we together so all we all know that we are at the highest point [Music] now uh the there seventh seal is the highest point it's the [Music] Zen and when you stand at the Zen or when you stand at the highest point you could see all over you could see the past and you could see your present and you could see the future we are in the last days we can see those things and the only way of seeing it of course is to be right at the highest point so now in other words when we are at the highest point we are able to see eternity and then we will always know actually where we are I always like to uh explain my my my my title so that you should understand and because once you miss the title you could heare a very nice sermon but you missed the point because each and everyon has got a purose it may it must take you a step further it's not just a nice good sermon but it has to do with the process of your Christian life so now the word of God is Not stagnant it's it's moving he says when the word comes comes out of his mouth it will not return void you see so now even ourselves we we we need to uh go with the same process uh I think we are together together so now I've got a slide which I always carry it with me that says we we we come from heaven and we are going back to Heaven I would like the brothers to to uh just put it on because uh the Bible says the one that is from Heaven is returning back to heaven now this slide of mine some of you is not the first time that they see it now the Zenith or the highest point it's when you see from from eternity to Eternity as you can see this slide it's got a pyramid right in the center and then uh there is where it's written in red it says heaven and then then it's different dispensation and on and on and on as you can round it you see the pillar of fire you see the the Ring The Ring of Eternity it moves on until it reach the Gentiles as you follow it you could see it oh yeah until you see where now the pointer is the red where it says Gentiles that is our time and then you see what we are waiting for is for the repure is also in R you see but if you could go back my brother start from heaven and so we'll have there I don't have it with me okay let me look at this side from Eden and the the time of Noah then Abraham Isaac ISAC Jacob Jacob Joseph Moses all those are dispensation josua jurges the Kings until the Messiah comes for those that don't know while we are still there the Messiah came to the Jews not for us then he was rejected by the Jews then he came to the Gentiles now to the Jews the Messiah came as the son of man to kep the the the Jewish pyramid but he was rejected and then that's how we were crafted in we we got in as the Gentiles because Mah was rejected by are we together now we are at the point where we have to change our bodies that is what we call Rapture after that Rapture and then God goes back to the Jews then there will be that battle of go which is Ezekiel 38 e in the time of tribulation of Moses and Elijah and then there will be the battle ofon then after the battle ofon then we've got Millennium there's a war of Co and of Revelation then there's white Throne judgment white judgment and then new Jerusalem now when you worship God you must know exactly where you are and and when you read your Bible you'll be able to place your verses accordingly when you read the verse that refers to the Jewish you will know that this is not mine but you'll read it for knowledge to knowledge but you should know where you are and what you are supposed to do because what you need now is a rapturing faith and the rapturing pH is what we call the seventh seene you see where I've written Rapture that has to do with your seventh seed that is why it's so important because the seventh SE it's it's Christ himself and Christ himself is the word himself and the word himself is God himself and God himself now is in you right amen that is says the poten you are a potential God now that comes through a revelation it's not something that you can teach a person you preach the word and then the person that listens and is predestinated then this thing is revealed unto you that's called your new name because the Revelation detects who you are it had to do with the predestination so now the seventh SE has got a power that power is called the third pool now the third pool is calling things into existence are we together amen now the prophet says the word is now in the bride and the bride knows what to do with it are we together he says you know what to do with it because you have thus said the Lord now you must know whether you have said or not and if you don't have you should ask yourself question why don't I have thus said the Lord because he says you know what to do with it because you have thus said the Lord are we together this is just to show you that now whenever uh God processed us it process us to different dimensions I mean different yeah dimensions are we together and dispensations so now you must not be ignorant of that must know you must must be able to place yourself are we together okay fine now the Bible says uh I would like us to read Romans chapter 1 verse 17 I'm still introducing my title so that you should know the Zen point which is the highest point Pinnacle verse uh 17 uh my brother Romans 1 verse 17 for therein is the rightousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now here the Bible says the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith you see it's a process is going it's a faith upon Faith now Faith to Faith it takes you higher last time I told you about the different Fates that there are some people that they've got a fluctuating Faith now the prophet speaks about the perfect faith that is that does not fluctuate that is says now that's why the Bible says the just shall believe by faith and the Bible also says God is not happy with somebody that H hasn't got any faith why is it because you haven't seen God with your natural eyes you haven't seen heaven with your natural eyes are we together and the word of God you receive it by faith you don't receive it by understanding no you receive it by faith so now that Faith must move on it's a faith that move to the faith until you reach Perfection Paul says we preach these things to the perfect people now your Perfection is your Zen because when God descend descend to a perfect person that's why the Bible says be ye therefore perfect as your father in Heaven so the perfect father will descend to a perfect person and now when it Des sent to a perfect person then you are at the Zen you are a minor God you are now a potential God you know all the mysteries of God are we together amen now the the highest point then let's give an example by Matthew there's a there's a scripture in the in the Book of Matthew chapter 4 in verse 5 Matthew 4: 5 uh just read it my brother verse five only then then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on a pinnacle of the temple so now it's it's verse four and five verse four I mean chapter 4 vers 5 vers 5 yes yeah it says now the [Music] devil uh let me uh check it also here amen Matthew four sorry or there it is then the devil take him into the holy city but let's start from from from the first verse from verse one from verse one yeah then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was after what and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God all right fine now when Jesus was tempted the Bible says it's after he has fasted 40 days and 40 nights and then that's when the tempter came and then it says now when the tempter came to him then he started tempting him after the fasting after the praying after regaining spiritual strength now the people that need to be tempted in the time that we are living remember that we are in the last days why why are we saying these are the last days that is the end of the Gentile time God is about to go to the Jews now we are the Gentiles now we are the bride and we are the threat you are the threat to the devil because there's nothing that the devil can do to you there's no way that he can engage you because you are the Perfection now being the perfection you determine his time when the nearer the Rapture comes the the the more the devil trembles because he GED himself by you you see amen once you reach the because you are the Perfection it means now he's nearer to the Lake of Fire when he look at you even if he knows that there's nothing that he can do and now here's our Lord Jesus Christ he knew exactly why he was there he knew he know he knew him from eternity right amen and then you know why he was here now the Temptation that he was doing he knows very well that he wouldn't succeed he was a threat to him because he came now you will see that now after that what happened I would like us to okay now it then the devil take him up into the holy city now what is the holy city the prophet says the holy city is New [Music] Jerusalem so now there was a new there was Jerusalem City and then which types the holy city and it is said that when Abraham was looking for a city he met MC the prince of that City are are we together now he took him there and seted him on a pinnacle of the temple the highest point of the because he wanted to to to to bring him down to take him out of his position so that he could would throw him down now remember this is a tempation is just tempting him so now you also brother Bram says uh before the The Squeeze come there will be a Temptation it says the bride will be tempted okay we'll we'll we'll we'll read that one but what what I'm showing you now is that now uh there is a highest point and the more you reach the highest point remember here the Bible say he after that I mean Jesus knew that now John was now arrested right now he must now start his ministry because John the Baptist was for running Jesus the Messiah now there was H uh the crossing over John Ministry was finished the ministry of Jesus if you could you could what you call let's go to verse uh uh 12 Matthew 4:12 oh start start from 11 where he failed we we don't care about the other things but he failed verse 11 then the devil leave him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him you see after he tried to tempt him tempt him he just says to him get thee you Satan for it is written thou shall Worship the Lord thy God and him only thou him only shall thou serve then the devil leave leave him right and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him right that is why if you check the Church ages there are always Overcomers from the first church age uh can I have that uh slide Brothers the church ages now you can never get a crown without fighting [Music] you can never be called an overcomer without winning a battle are we together so there's a slide of change ages yeah that's the one that if if you look at that that slide each and every CH age there's an overcomer right amen there's a group that I will quote here which are called the Overcomers now we are at the last stage age we are called the Overcomers but you can never be an overcomer if you have not fought and win a battle are we together amen so our God our Lord Jesus Christ was tempted and he overcame and then the Angels Came and ministered unto him then verse 12 brother now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into gal 13 and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernum which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and Ne Nepal that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Zebulon and the land of nepalm by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which said in Darkness saw great light and to them which set in the regions and shadows of death light is sprung up now the important verse is verse 17 listen to that one it says from that time Jesus began to preach you see amen from that time Jesus waited until John dispensation was full now after it was fulfilled then he was in power there could not be two of them at the same time because John would always point at him and say there is the Lamb of God but now that didn't need an understanding it needed a revelation because when he says there is a lamb of God they saw Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary so they could not understand now after John Ministry has expired then Jesus began now to preach right amen now Verse 18 says and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishes and he said unto them follow me and I will make you fishes of me and they straightway left their Nets and followed him now he didn't preach any seron to he just said follow [Music] me now where was the magnet I mean a man cannot just pass by and say follow me follow you see like Elijah he just touched Elisha he didn't say any word he just touched him and move on and Elisha said wait for me and what did he do he took his oxen and what did he do I think he made a bright Place yeah I said no these are useless May the bra people because he have seen the value of his life Peter and his brother here they did not question Jesus you see now if you are predestinated you just need a touch once you you see that touch and only he goes because the ministry it has got its own power and it has got its own people I will show you here you don't have to struggle no you preach the word that comes out of him and then it will not come for void it will bring what God had said so you you don't have to be scared who are you no right now what happened again verse 21 verse 21 and going on from then he saw another two Brethren James the son of zebede and John his brother in a sheep with zebede their father mening their Nets and he called them yeah and they immediately left the sheep and their father and followed him look at that and the father didn't say hi you boys where are you going no it it is a thing look your your your your your your your predestinated life it's from eternity to ET there there's nothing that's going to be an obstacle on your spiritual life there's nothing that is going you going to fear about that is why an angel when the angel comes to brother B he says fear not and when an angel comes to Daniel he says fear not you don't have to meditate no it's what you are you are predestinated now these boys their father didn't say they are disrespectful they just leave me with the job the father had an understanding that they met the master so there's a there's a pool now when we speak about the third pool we speaking about something that pulls you it it has a pool in itself you won't resist it and there will be no obstacle there's nothing that will stand between you you are from eternity we are going to Eternity it's a ring of Eternity that's how you are are we together amen now remember when our Lord Jesus Christ went to pray and fasted listen to what it says verse one verse one on on on the first Matthew chapter 4 Matthew 4 verse one read verse one then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness he was led that is the beginning of his ministry the spirit led him yeah and he was led to be tempted now whoever was tempting him was tempting the spirit and whoever is tempting you is tempting the spirit that is he's not tempting you as an individual he's tempting the owner the life that is in you if the life that is in you is an eternal life there's no way that you'll be tempted now until he was changing Sports now our Lord Jesus Christ was showing him that he is the master he can take him to any position and you as the bride the devil you can challenge him on any ground from any position because he that is in you is greater than the one that in the you can challenge him in any position look what the devil did he took him uh to the holy city to the Pinnacle still he failed verse 8 verse 8 again the devil taken him up in into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them so he keeps on taking him to the higher not knowing that the Zen the highest point that's why he sees everything now because he was the creator of all those things now if the word is in you that you know what to do the word is to speak things into existence and when you speak things into existence nobody can tempt you about your things because you are the word you cannot temp the word because the word is the creator he created everything by his way in the beginning God created heaven and Earth by his way so now everything that is there was created by Him there's nothing that will tempt you because you were there when they were when it was cre are we together amen so we reading verse verse 8 we read verse we read verse 8 okay come again verse eight verse eight yes let's go to chapter 5 go chapter 5 Matthew uh verse one verse one and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them okay fine now his ministry started where did his ministry start where was the venue says and seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain why didn't you preach to them right there because now his his his his ministry is on upper level so he took them to the upper level he took them to the Zen seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain when he was said then his disciples came unto him then he started teaching them now that's what I want to I want ask to Fellowship the the zeni which is the point of Interest now that you know who you are we are right at the Zen then we can go and go back to jeel now we have read jeel chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 28 uh it says here and it shall come to pass after that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your old men dream dreams your young man uh shall see Visions your daughters shall Pro prophesy remember don't forget that uh you are only be able to see the past and the future through the Zen when you are at the Zen you look at the past you look at the future you are here your presence is here you only able to see the past and the future through your presence it all depends where you stand now uh the revelation of the seventh SE is the Zenit point now you understand when I say this the seven SE is the Zenit point because you look at things as the minor God all right we had the past and we have the present and we will have our future all prophecies pointing to the future but what happened is that now the Prophecies of the past were pointing to us Isaiah isah that is a prophet Prophet says a virgin shall conceive and bear a son that is a prophet which was pointing to the Future during the time of Isaiah it was a prophecy pointing to the Future and then the Virgin conceived when the Virgin conceived and bear a son there was prophecies that were pointing to the Future which when the the Virgin conceived it was a a presence during that time are we together amen it's a fulfillment of the prophecy right then it's pointing forward and then when the Messiah comes then he says I will send you he says no these things that I'm telling you you won't be able to carry I will send you a comforter you see is pointing to a future I will send you a comfort you now present here wait for the comforter those who were standing it was during their their presence they could see the past they could see the present and they were waiting for the future are we together amen and then when the comforter comes it can be a finished work because there are prophecies there are dreams are we together and there are visions that are pointing to the Future now let let's let's let's go into that let's take for instance Genesis 13 uh let's read verse 14 my brother 14 15 16 up to 17 yes Genesis 13 verse 14 to 17 remember we have our past and uh we always say may the Lord bless our past spiritual fathers who vigorously PVE the way because now for us who are the last in the race remember we are the last in the race uh in the race there is what they call relay there's a one that begins race he start with a very very fast space and on and on and on and on but the last one is the one that have to win the the race and then you cannot put a person that you know that is slow to be the last Runner because during the the race itself how has the pon go from one person to another there are those that have got stamina but they are not fast there could be a way that they open up a gap but the last one must close all the gaps you see now you are the one that have to close all the gaps and run as fast as you can and you cannot be the last Runner if you don't have the right pace you are put here as the last Runner because you can make [Applause] it see and you should know that you can make it and you will make it are we together amen don't lose the P right amen now you were still reading my brother Genesis chter 13 yes from verse 14 m and the Lord said unto Abraham after that Lord was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall they thy seat also be numbered verse 17 arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the bread of it for I will give it unto you yeah now here is a prophecy God is promising Abraham in verse 14 he says he says look from the place where you are you look northwards as far as your eyes could go that's your place you look to the South as far as your eyes could see that is your place you look to the west and the East like is a promise right amen and then it says now verse 15 verse 15 for all the land which thou seest I will give it forever now when uh God or Moses took the children children of Israel to the promised land the way people there were people that can claim this is our place but now what what God do is that now uh after the dispensations of Noah look God wanted people that can worship Him in truth and in spirit when it destroyed the world during the time of Noah it it it was because people could not worship him as he wishes so he destroyed them because he created heaven and earth this is his place he want his people to dwell here then there comes the era of Noah's children H Shem and jaff and you name it and also during that time people started doing their thing until he called Abraham he said out of you I want people that will worship me anybody that does not worship me this is my place I get rid of him I'm giving you this place because it's mine are we together amen so he met Abraham and spoke to Abraham and he was with one is an is an angel is a judgment Angel when God want to destroy he send he controls all the water worwood worwood so is an investigating judgment angel you see so now he says go and Destroy because he's got mwood he's got who's that again Gabriel he's got Gabriel are we together so those there's lot of angels there but then what I'm trying to say to you is that now that was his place and he will place his people where he wants there were people there that is why Caleb couldn't see a defeat there were giants of course and Caleb pointed hebon Heron was occupied by Giants and big walls and then he said now I want that's mine he was not seeing the giant he was seeing his place that God has revealed unto him it's it's like yourself you don't see a threat here you see what God has promised you now what what he put in the heart of Abraham and his seed remember he says Abraham and his seed in verse 16 now to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made then it continues and says no it's Galatians sorry Ians 3:16 I'm reading Galatians 3:16 now he he separates now the seed from the seeds now to Abraham and his seed Not seeds seed where the promise I where the promise made and he continues and says he said not and to the seats I don't know whether you understand it now amen as many but as of one to thy seed which is Christ you see amen now there is a physical seat of Abraham there is a spiritual seed of ab now the spiritual Seed of Abraham is Christ now you are the Seed of Abraham what makes you the Seed of Abraham it's because you are Christ why do we say you are Christ it's because the word is now in you the word has made you Christ because uh the word the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God now the Word was God now where is that we now it's in you what is the difference between Christ and the we when God unfolds himself God was was a spirit or it was seven rainbow color and when they come together they formed a pillar of fire which is called logos that's the one Moses saw in the burning bush if you read Exodus chapter 3 don't go to it you'll read it at home is that verse two says God spoke from the pillar of fire verse four says the angel of the Lord spoke from the pillar of now God can take a form and become an angel so when God being the seven rainbow colors came together and then it became the logos now what is logos it's still God the prophet says logos is the Son of God are we together in order that you should see God see the pillar of fire now the pillar fire which is God himself still the we and Christ is the anointed one it's God in a form of a spirit when the word of God comes to you it's the spirit of God that comes to you the spirit of God forms it's a seed it's planted in your seed germinates and form Christ who is a spirit now it forms Christ who is a spirit that is why now it says you are the Seed of Abraham which is Christ you are that seed there is a natural seed which are the the sons of Jacob which is the Seed of Abraham seeds of Abraham are we together so God took Abraham and promised him that was a to to to the Israelites that was the past now the manifestation of the past uh it's like when there is a prophecy the prophet that prophesies he prophesies things according to the way he sees them but as time goes on things changes you know remember he said Israel will be scattered throughout the world but he will come back in the wings of an eagle it's because the the the prophet that saw that Vision he saw an aeroplane and there were no aeroplanes that there were donkeys to that so to him it was just an eagle are we together amen now the prophecies that were made during the time of Abraham some of them we could see them as we are preparing for the Rapture as things going to the end of our our our dispensation and those things are showing up that is why now uh let's go back again to Genesis Chapter 18 so we have read here now it says now God took him to a certain level took him to a certain level to a certain height that is the spiritual height and gave him a prophecy now it depends on where when did you receive the promise now the the promise will never uh lose its power and its level it will move along that level it it will never be a weak prophecy and it will never uh be in incarnated to a weak person if God prophesied about you the prophecy comes from God it won't go to a weak person that will disbelieve it because it from God it goes to a person that comes from God that descended from God it will keep its strength it will it will not lose its strength as time goes on as the time goes on it will gain its strength right amen now here it is let's go to uh Genesis 16 Genesis I mean 18 verse 16 up to 18 Genesis 18 verse 16 to 18 and the men rose up from fence and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a Great and Mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him you hear what it says all all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him all the nations of that comes from God now that is why he said I won't hide anything now if he didn't hide anything from Abraham what about his seed which is Christ himself never hide anything from you because the Bible says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all Mysteries should be finished all of them now you reject that uh seven Angel you reject your blessings you cannot reject the prophet and receive the blessings before you cannot read this scripture Revelation 10:7 and reject brother BR but the Bible says but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel the seventh angel is brother Bren he the one that will reveal the Mysteries all the days but it says in the days his days yeah now his ministry is a blessing itself but now here's ministry as she goes on on the ministry the ministry gains strength and it gains velocity how you get it gains power because it it has got different pools it's got the first and then it shoots again and goes to the second and it shoots again it goes to the Third so it's gaining strength and strength and strength are we together as it reaches the third pool it Cruise now Cru are we together now it push on are we together now we are cruising we are cruising we could see all Dimensions we could see all dis we have all the power are we together that is us how you get right now the man rules when he says the men rul it means the two angels that were with him and and those were angel of judgment they rules now going to do their work and look towards Sodom you know when When God Says attack when takes [Music] on there's nobody that will touch you you are the word of God you know what happened to our Lord after he was tempted and overcame the Angels Came and worship him where were the Angels when he was tempted there where are the Angels when you areed they are surrounding you [Applause] if you overcome they come and worship you say you are an overcome your angel is always with you and your angel is your Revelation the power that is in you you must know that you have a power are together amen it should be new [Applause] right amen now when worwood look at Sodom God who was with Abraham knew that now things are going to happen then he said no I won't hide anything for I'm going to destroy that place and God will never hide anything from the seed of ab will never hide anything from you no because you in you want do things that you don't know that you scratch your head and say but why God didn't tell right amen seeing that abraam shall surely become a great shall become a great Great and Mighty Nation now if you go to verse 222 says and the men turned their faces from then and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the [Music] Lord now what happened now Abraham get up in the morning to a place where he stood before the Lord there was anointing there when he stand there he could see everything that's why he was able to see uh that now uh the smoke went up and then he knew that now that was the end of s now let's go toomy uh verse 34 I mean chapter 34 Deuteronomy chapter 34 now I'm I'm just showing you these things that now the P the past the present the future you are the only one that knows it because you are the last Runner Paul was pointing to us the Bible says some of the prophets they wish that they could live during our because God has shown his bride everything because his bride is in his heart his bride is his soul right amen now in the book of Deuteronomy let's read from verse one up to 4 vers 1 to4 and Moses went up from the pl of M MO unto the mountain of nebble to the top of Pisa that is over against Jericho and the Lord showed him all the land of G gilit unto Dan and all Nepali and the land of Ephraim and manasse and all the land of Judah unto the atos Sea and the South and the plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees unto Z and the Lord said unto him this is the land which i s unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob saying I will give it unto thy seat I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shall not go over Fe you see now that was the Fulfillment of the prophecy he promised Abraham last time when I was preaching I said God cannot uh make you to uh preach to people about something you don't know and something that you are guessing about are we together now and the people that are going to cross over will be part of the ministry because he had Moses I mean Moses was shown the place and all the way from Egypt up toades Moses was standing before Israel and God God will say let me get rid of these people and then Moses will say no you start by me he stand before them you know what the Bible says let me read you the scripture it's a book of uh uh yeah it's a book of um sorry Hebrews uh the book of Hebrews uh it says chapter 13 I want you to to to to be with me in that one let's read verse 17 or let's start by verse 5 Hebrews chter 13 ver 5 H let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as he have for he ha said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee then jump to seven then verse 7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith whose Faith follow considering the end of their convers ation now he says remember them which have the rule over you and who has spoken unto you who has spoken unto you the word of God it says remember them whose faith f considering the end of their conversation go to verse 17 verse 17 obey them that have the rule over you so there's somebody that has got rule over you look okay continue obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account they they watch for your soul Moses Moses that is why now he considered the soul because you will stand between God and this now a pastor is a man that consider your soul he he was built like that it's not something that happened overnight God when he created him he knew what he was doing now start again 17 obey them obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourself for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy they they must give account because God make him a leader and gave him a spirit and gave him a revelation and gave him faith and gave him virtue and gave him everything now when you are a soldier you are given everything to go and fight and you don't use those things then you are caught Marshall now when you are a pastor you are empowered with everything and if you don't use that then you must give account so now when they give account they must do it with with joy joy amen and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you if he gives an account about you if he he he is not happy about you is unprofitable to you because he must give must say when he look at kosana I that is my sheep I'm happy about him are you together but if he look at and say then he's doing that with G he's not sure about you are we together look brother Bram said he the pastor will see you through and that thing is an insult to lot of people they say no Jesus not the pastor Jesus not not fine where is Jesus Jesus come as a spirit and he comes as a spirit and the Bible says we've got fivefold ministri some prophets some pastors I mean Apostles some apost some you know teachers and evangelist no those are the spirits of Christ the spirit of Christ if if if you want to see Christ you see him in that Ministry right let's continue then I just deated a bit just to want to show you that when Moses was leading them he had a vision where he's taking them when your pastor is leading you he's got a vision of where he's taking are we together amen right so now you see Moses was shown the place and then when he slept he slept with joy he has arrived it was shown unto him say y your ministry ends up here he won't go in and he said Hallelujah and he went in glory he went in glory knowing that he has completed his dispensation right amen uh we had our spiritual fathers you know the crossing of the Red Sea was to those that were in ction all those that were inau they were the one that could cross the because they were examined by the angel who find them worthy because of the blood stain that followed the commission so they were worthy to cross over but if you were not worthy you won cross that is why Caleb cross right now let's go to our scripture uh the Bible says uh they shall dream dreams he says you shall prophesy that is your daughters and the old men shall dream dreams and the young men shall see vision now in this book uh I mean the fifth seal paragraph paragraph 91 am the the the fifth seal I want to read something about the the dreams now it says here I'll start where he says uh six straight dreams came exactly with a vision a dream interpreted last time I I spoke about them now he says now uh a dream interpreted is a vision if you dream and then your dream is interpreted then you have seen a vision because a person may not be born with a subconscious to stay be awake when he sees it then I'll explain that then God gots over his subconscious and speaks to him which he promise that in dreams in the last days he will visit them now let's go to paragraph 32 to explain everything in the same book no no no the book uh healing line healing line healing line healing uh parag 32 paragraph 32 amen uh I I'll wait for you because I didn't give you this thing I'll wait until you you flash it there amen healing line paragraph 32 32 just just to to to say something about the the the dreams the visions and the prophecies right paragraph 32 32 and and the Bible said in the last days the old man will dream dreams have you got it there the and the Bible said in the last days shall the old men I mean the that the old men will dream dreams again and the young men will see visions now perhaps maybe the man that doesn't dream a dream his subconscious be a way back now you've got conscious and no no conscience and I've got there's a time when you are cautious you are awake yes and then there's a time when you sleep and when you when you you you are awake you could see things because your mind is okay but when you are asleep all your body parts are relaxed and your mind is relaxed it's only your subconscious that is uh awake okay let me just try you what happen when you are where are you when you are asleep you all sleep yeah there's nobody can you tell me where you where are you when you asleep you're not dead you asleep it's because your mind want to rest and once your mind rest your body your body is resting but you it's your subconscious now that is working but remember your soul does not sleep your soul travels the real you is your soul are we together now when you are asleep you dream now what is a dream that's why the the the the the the the the Bible say I mean the prophet says when a dream is interpreted is a vision now he says now there's conscious there's subconscious they next they are next to each other there are people that are blessed that they don't sleep if they want to see a thing they could just see it they gifted to that there are some other people before they could see a thing they must sleep and they will dream and times when they wake up they know that they had they had a dream but they can't remember what that there are some people that can interpret that dream now that's where now the Devil comes in when you are asleep he comes now in your subconscious when he comes into your subconscious you think you are dreaming is the demon will appear as your grandmother or your grandfather or whoever it is tell you stories and when you wake up I've seen my grandmother he told me this in he even showed me a a red R or a white or a blue or whatever he said go and buy those things and you go and buy them are we together or you go to a s tell him about your dream then he will say no go and buy those things and then I will initiate you in other words I will make you to communicate with whoever it is but he came to a subconscious let me tell you you can be strong physically you can have dogs in your house proves and gun are we together but the spirit enters and go to a subconscious and beat you up that strong man will hear him shouting and say yeah so there's nothing that you can do I body is asleep and everything so now you you're traveling Soul it's not strong enough cannot protect you look if the word of God is in your soul and your soul is alive there's not demon that will torment you at night because your soul becomes the word but if your soul is not the word and the demon will come as one of the member the person who in hell and crying in the and then it will come in that way and then you will start worshiping that why you worshiping that worshiping a demon and you think is one of the me members of the you will see when somebody passes and then they will say inace they don't know that know they are worshiping the know that they are worshiping the once a person once the the spirit the soul and the body separates there's no either you are in Hell or you are in a six Dimension now what the prophet says here he says some are born with their conscious and subconscious together they could see things some will sleep like he says here now subconscious will be way back like over there the that person sleeps real sound a dreamer doesn't sleep soundly but now the one with subconscious way back he never get back to it he just sleeps through are we together am I've got this book also trying to do God a service without will then he says here he speaks about the for knowledge he says now his for knowledge has caused him to set in the church and in the people that's God's for knowledge has caused him God to set in the church and in the people certain things that he did not he did from the beginning when I say and he said in the church yeah and in the people certain things that he did from the beginning and then the gospel that being preached to the age is revealed just recent only is only revealed to that certain people like the seven seene is revealed to certain people the rest of them don't see it let me repeat that and his full knowledge caus him to set in the church and in the people certain things that he did from the beginning then the gospel that's preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people are we together preach only to that certain people the rest of them don't see it the seventh SE it's for certain people the third pool is for certain people the rest doesn't [Music] see that's why they say what is this all about what is this seven we've been hearing the word of God all all of a sudden they come with stories it's for certain people that's why he said Thank thee father th is he these things from the eyes of the wise has Heed These Things From The Wise let me read thou had Heed These Things From the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to the baby such as you Le see that is predestination you know that John the Baptist was the only one that saw the Holy Ghost when the spirit descended to Jesus there were many people John was baptizing but he was the only one that saw that's certain people he was a certain person he could see those things brother Bram says oh yeah let me read it here it says I'm reading earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints amen now he says here paragraph 22 but John saw the Holy Ghost like a dve coming down upon you a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased God was bearing a record there were many people but they could not see that it's only John that's there are many people they could not see the seven SE it's only the bride that can because it's for certain people he says again many people that see something like this Angel here on the picture say Ang here on the picture somebody says they are woring a white man we are looking at that angel that ring of Eternity that logos this man is an anointed man of God the angel of the Lord give record or bear record when God sends you he must bear a record so here he Bears a record then he says now it's only certain people that could see this Angel here on the picture it's been seen by millions of people some say oh oh no it's just given sometimes to certain people then he continues and says the wise men you believe they saw a star none of the observat they even kept time by the Stars nobody else saw nothing but it was the wise man it was just it was just given to them that is why it's just given to you you can sit with somebody the whole night if it's not given unto him he won't see it the pastor can preach until blood comes out of his ear a person that is not given today won see it because it's not for him when Paul was streaking down breaking down a light blinded him the same light the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel so it's I jesus who stand before you but the men with him they had nothing they haven't seen anything right amen and they were right with him Soldiers with him cars from the temple they never had it it's just given to some people to see and hear things it's given to some people to hear things and see things not all prophets not all the apostles not all you not all are prophets not all are Apostles not all of this or that but it's given those things are born in Us by election what say those things are born in Us by election and if it's not born in You by election you won't go race somewhere somehow take a you take another Direction how geten those things are born in Us by election that's why the Bible says gifts and calling are see gibs and cing are not now now what the prophet says here uh I always emphasizes on the on the thir pool on the ministry when the ministry changes uh they tend to get confused like the ministry of brother br they could see him when the Bible says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet no and then he will he will do what he will turn they could see him turning their hearts of the children to their fathers then it ends up there but when the new commission starts it becomes a problem look they followed John the Baptist oh let's leave John they followed Moses when now the new commission comes which is John the Baptist what did they do they cut off his because he's got a new Commission Now his disciples followed John right when the new commission comes that is of Christ they still followed John until his head was chopped off maybe some of them went back to fishing they disciples follow Jesus when now the new commission comes because his his his ministry was to share his brother are we together amen so they didn't want him to do that and then when now that happens they went on for fishing are we together amen so now when brother Bram Ministry ended up it ended up then comes the ministry of the Angel because he went westwards he met an angel and when he comes back it's another dispensation he got now the ministry of an angel now people are waiting for Christ to come and open up the book because the Bible says the lamb took the book right am when now man or the lamb himself or Christ himself in a man open up that thing then they said no they they don't see the changing of the ministry now the angel of the Lord the notable one look remember last time I told you that brother had a dream or a vision one of the two then he saw the angel that was always behind him and the the logos going to another building and the voice said I will meet you there then that was and then he says no that is the fful Min are we together now we are not in aition ch we crossed over okay in closing can I have uh that slide of the church age again the first one just just in closing are we together now as believe the other one the other one the first one amen the first one it's on the same slide but the first one are we together if if you don't have then let's have the last uh slide that we have of the church AG now we we should know that now the will of God is Not stagnant even in you it's not St okay I have this one here uh yeah the other one brother you you yes that's that's the one I want no what's wrong yeah that's the one I want look what the devil is doing the first three Church ages there was an antichrist and the fourth Church Age The Very Antichrist came a false prophet right amen and the fifth six Church age that Antichrist that false prophet became a VI now the seventh Church AG he's the Beast right amen the Bible says he's a terrible Beast Daniel had a dream and vision and saw it so we are concentrating so we we are over where it's written love we we cross over when we speak about the seven SE we speak in another level are we together so now we were saying uh you have a a soul you have a mind they have a conscious and subconscious and then they've got a mode when you soul is in a right mode and then it cannot be influen by the evil spirit because now you grew to an extend where you are are together now here we are now the Bible says when the devil comes in like a flood God raises up a stand when he comes like an antichrist God raises a standard when he changes to be false prophet God raises an anti now there's always Overcomers when it becomes a VI God raises a standard now that they are worshiping now remember all the seven Church ages are named after different cities and these cities were worshiping the devil they've got images that they have like the first one they had an image of Diana they were worshiping Diana on and on onia they were worshiping Ze are we together which is the son of the devil no is the Devil Himself now in the time that you are living in if one wants to worship the devil it's a free moral world you can build your church there you can worship your devil in the olden days you won't see 12 years you won't see a a school child being a now the devil has lost they do that at school are we together and if the the evil spirit attack a child to school you are not supposed to pray for that they could sue you they say no his grandfather is is has visited the child and you say go out get out that is an abuse abusing each other now what they're saying now if you you you kick out the devil or the demon and if you cast it out they say it's an abuse because he the demon of that person he loves that thing why are you chasing it out oh together now you see where we are now we are in the last days and you should say thank you Father because you see these things and some members of your family they don't see it that is why they've rejected you and now if you don't have a revelation you think that they've rejected you but you you have gained a better life are we together so brothers and sisters we are at the Z that's where we are we are at the highest point then we should know who we are may the Lord bless [Applause] you Paul amen God bless you hallelujah
