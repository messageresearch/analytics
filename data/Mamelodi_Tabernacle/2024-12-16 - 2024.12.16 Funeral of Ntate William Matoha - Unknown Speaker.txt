resurrection and the life he that believe in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whoo live and believe in me shall never die beli thou this you may take your seats I want to title my message this morning death is only a change of a Dwelling Place death is only a change of a dwelling place and I just want to read few script scriptures just to show you that we change Dwelling Places before you came here on the earth you were an attribute in God and I'm going to read Ephesians chapter 1 and it says according as he has chosen Us in him so that means we lived somewhere before he has chosen us him before the foundation of the world that means before God made the heavens and the Earth before this missile was formed we were in him we wereb we lived in him chose us in him then he brought us to the Earth he made the garden of Ed and from the dust of the he formed a man for he said let us make man in our own image so when God said let us he was speaking to us but we were in him so it was time to change the dwelling place let us make man in our own and the Bible says he made man in his own image and he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth body that we are living in is a body that was made from the Dust of the our initialing place not this body but God is a spirit and that means we were also the spirit in him so God is a spirit with the capital letter s but we are referred to as the spirit so God was speaking to us but we were in him aing place there was a time that job was troubled after the trials during the trials then God visited and said where were you the sons of God were shouting for Joy so he brought job to a remebrance so that he can remember where he was before remember he was in him and he was there for Joy be God created the Heaven and the Earth says we were there when God visited he asked him where were you sons of God were shouting when job remembered that he was in him when we are here on the we don't remember our initial but God visit each one of us of the Lord Jesus Christ we can know our next delling place God first brings you where you come from when a woman gives birth to the child when the child grow a child do not remember that she he or she was in the mother's room how many can stand and testify so God brings us to a remembrance our dwelling place now allow me to read the book of Luke and Luke chapter 16 Luke chapter 16 just to show you about The Dwelling Places death only change youring death do not change only God CH here on the earth death only change your Dwelling Place The Book of Luke says L2 and it came to pass I believe you want to assist may the Lord richly bless you The Book of Luke 16 says and it came to pass that the Begg died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's BOS the rich man also died and was buried you see when the Beg dieded by the Angels but this rich man when he died the Bible says he was buried and in h he lifted up his eyes see this rich man was not a Believer he didn't believe the go gospel so he died a sinner so he was buried when he the Bible says and inhale he lift up his eyes being in torment so this one was not a Believer death brought him to a Dwelling Place which was hell so when he lifted up his eyes now it continue and says and see Abraham now in those days we had Paradise they were in the same Dimension but they were divided by a Gul and they were able to see one another but the one that was in Hell could not cross into Paradise but could see what was happening in Paradise inor but there was a between them but remember in the Old Testament it was under the blood of animal they were not washed by the blood of the Lamb the blood of animals a sacrifice not remove the desire of sin but the blood of Jesus Christ sanctify you justify you and remove even the desire of gives you part of himself so in in Paradise they only went because they believed the message goel that was preached but their sins were not fully washed so that's why it was Paradise but after the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ When They Crucified the Lord Jesus Christ now he went down to Hell and took the keys from Satan the keys of hell and death because people were tormented by Death then when he after he took the keys now he moved paradise and I want us to look at how he changed the dwelling place I want us to go to the Book of Psalms Psalms 24 2 and look at how he removed them from Paradise I'm going to read from vers s in Paradise when you die in old man inise will remain an old man but when the Lord Jesus Christ changed that place separated paradise and hell to the six dimension when you are a Christian and you die you are no longer going to be olda makes you young you remember the witch of when sa went to the wit of the Samuel and he came with his nature of being a prophet of [Music] upon was an old man but today that paradise has been separated from I moved to a new Dwelling Place which is the sixth dimension 24 ver up your head ye gates and be lifted up see after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ when you read the book of Matthew 28 2 it says and the saints that slept resed with him and they appeared unto many they appeared for 40 days there after he went up with a cloud it was a Rapture they ascended up in the form of a CL now that was 24 he was moving them up to a new dimens moving Paradise separating from hell what the saint were saying a new city now when they were moved to the new Dwelling Place which is under the altar which is the six Dimension now they were shouting lift up your heads oh ye gates and be ye lifted up ye Everlasting doors Glory shall come in the saints that were in Paradise moving to a new Dwelling Place and they were shouting commanding the Angels LIF up and be lifted up now the Angels were asking who is this king of [Music] glory and the Saints started to shout and mighty the Lord Mighty now all the time the Angels woring God surrounding the Holy Holy come the Saints old test commanding the angels the king of glory Angels don't have soul and part of God now it says amen the Angels were surprised who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle now it was the Saints telling the Angels who the king of glory from the old Paradise that was to hell now they were moved to a new place di we die today go to go to Six Dimension the wishes today cannot call up Samu has [Music] been they cannot even see they cannot see the same but the Lord Jesus Christ toise who is this king of glory so now the dwelling place let us go back to our scripture John chapter 11an [Music] 11 11 I only have less than 15 minutes left and Jesus said unto her I'm the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead shall he live those that believe in the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says though they are dead they shall and it talks to us now and whoever and believe in me shall never die amen you see he speaks to the dead and says he that believeth in me so if you die today because you believed in him he says I am the resurrection and life though he were dead yet shall he live amen amen hallelujah whosoever live now it is speaking to you and me and believeth in me he shall never die amen amen amen let me take you to another scripture the Lord Jesus Christ to the and he says unto them chapter 8 The Book of John John 8 verse 51s 51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my say shall never see death amen he says amen um Let Me Close says if a man keep my say shall never see allow me to read the last scriptures here will close in prayer I'm going to read John 5 start with verse 24 I say unto you that he my weight and believeth on him that sent me you see the Lord Jesus Christ telling us how to go to the six Dimension six dimension death only change our daily place so from the the say of the Lord Jesus Christ he says you shall never see death that means when you are separated from this life you go into the six Dimension let me read it says and ver very I say unto you he that believeth my word believe on him that sent me everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but passed from Death unto life you believe the saying of the Lord Jesus Christ vers 25 I say the is coming and now is shall hear the voice of the Son of God the B says whosoever live now the the living must be quickened by the Holy Spirit then they shall never see them so if you are not quickened then you are not resurrected because it says I say unto you the hour is coming now meaning now the living must be quickened the word quickening dead and you are Made Alive so the holy spirit is the quickening power to make you leave amen and they that here shall last you see the voice of Resurrection is only to those that have heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will those that are alive quick die because if you are not quickened you can come in the first resurrection so the gospel is preached that they come the first resurrection and when you are quickened you are given power to overcome death when you are separated from this life change the dwelling place you are not going to hell because already you are Quicken go to the six diens now let me read the last verse not at this verse 28 for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves hear his voice so if you reject the voice today you going to hear in the gra those that are quickened now the Bible says they will not see the second death but if you are not quickened while you are still then you have a problem with the you see when we are separated from we normally call it death and it is [Music] painful but this is just separation changing to another Beed the name of the Lord Jesus so that you can go to the but if you are not quickened alive problem second death may the Lord because of time allow me to stop here amen I will ask [Music] our word we can hand over to the program director as we close our eyes our heavenly father we have
