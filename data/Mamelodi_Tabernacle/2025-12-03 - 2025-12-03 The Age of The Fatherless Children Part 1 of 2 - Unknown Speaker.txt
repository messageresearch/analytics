========================================
[music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to the scripture and start reading. &gt;&gt; Pray for us next next week. We won't be around for over the weekend. We are trying to limit our visit. But they are beyond our control. &gt;&gt; Let us read &gt;&gt; second Timothy chapter 4 from verse one to verse 8. I judge thee be therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom. Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exalt with all longsufferings and doctrine. For a time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things and due afflictions do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered. And the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid upon for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've got their Amen. uh uh Bibles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh if you may offer a prayer &gt;&gt; before the proceedings. &gt;&gt; Our most dear loving heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again this morning we've read your word of life. &gt;&gt; And father, here is your man's servant standing before us. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, a vessel that you are going to use to open this word. Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may have open Bibles on the physical side, but Father, we we desire and require the spiritual opening of this word &gt;&gt; by revelation again. And Father, we know &gt;&gt; that there's only one way that you use, and that is the way of a man. &gt;&gt; And Father, again, we pray for our pastor that you come and indwelling, &gt;&gt; speak through him again this morning as you bring your word of life to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I believe winter hasn't comes yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not yet winter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's &gt;&gt; all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I just have a a little thought. um as God has just put it in my heart when I was actually working on something else, something else. And uh it looks like God has set that one aside for some time and pointed me to the book of Timothy. Timothy. &gt;&gt; Then yesterday I noticed that the book of Timothy is the book of a father and his son. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul and Timothy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now then I decided to read that one a father and his son. Hallelujah. And while thinking along those lines, then I came up with the a subject, the age of the fatherless children. Hallelujah. I grew up without a father &gt;&gt; and uh our my father left us when we were still young. That's why every time you you will always hear me mentioning my mother, not my father because Um, without a father, &gt;&gt; uh, there's nothing to refer back to. &gt;&gt; And now fatherless child. Hallelujah. They grow up without guidance. Amen. or commitment &gt;&gt; commitment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, God will always give a mother wisdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the absence of their father. &gt;&gt; Amen. as he did that with my mother. That's why every time I can only refer to my mother and my father married married another woman somewhere and yet now &gt;&gt; for me to refer to a father that's when referring to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's been my father all along. &gt;&gt; He took care of me. He has taught me things about life. &gt;&gt; And I realized that he is a a real father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who will never teach you and marry another woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's now I want to now a a a children a child without a father &gt;&gt; and without God. cannot trace himself because if you are a child, you are a gene father. Amen. &gt;&gt; The father is the seed carrier. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mama is the field. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God partnershipped them like that for the law of reproduction to take place because men the male alone cannot bring forth children. Amen. So that's why God said it is not good that men should be alone. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the law of reproduction would not apply. So he made him a help me not something for to abuse a partner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Adam being alone he could not reproduce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will just remain alone. Yes. &gt;&gt; For Jesus being alone, &gt;&gt; he could not reproduce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He must have a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Paul talking to a son. &gt;&gt; He has found in Timothy a real spiritual son. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he started to download all that he had upon Timothy. Amen. Seeing that by the time he leaves the field there is a a successor. Amen. Timothy will take over. &gt;&gt; So if you read the whole book of Timothy, you'll find that Paul was just working on Timothy. Amen. Amen. Now here he's talking to Timothy and to the church and but Timothy is the keystone there and as he says preached the word. &gt;&gt; Timothy was a young man. &gt;&gt; Amen. You find this young men like David, Daniel, Shadrach, you find them in the Bible, young men. Now why young um I read a part here that in the book of Genesis the first man was a young man. Amen. [cheering] [applause] Amen. And it says here, there was a tree of life in the future home book. And this tree of life reminded Adam of his youth. His youth was continually going on. Amen. Amen. Because the tree was for the healing, keeping him young. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need that tree today. Amen. Amen. When Abraham and Sarah were stricken in age, Elohim cameoh &gt;&gt; and uh the Bible says &gt;&gt; he changed them. &gt;&gt; They they were changed within &gt;&gt; because uh they were beyond their prime. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They couldn't bear. She couldn't bear children. &gt;&gt; But God said to Abraham, "I I shall return according to the time of life, and Sarah, your wife, shall have a son." Amen. &gt;&gt; Science wouldn't touch that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read you something here. Amen. Um I prefer to talk to you then and you'll see that both physically and spiritually this is the age of the fatherless. Spiritually you find children without a father &gt;&gt; now without any direction. &gt;&gt; Now they heap upon themselves teachers with itching ears to hear. &gt;&gt; Now the world today Yes. &gt;&gt; Is have you seen technology today? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Facebook. &gt;&gt; Facebook. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh maybe next time there will be a body book. &gt;&gt; Body book. [applause] Next time a feed book, it's coming like that. &gt;&gt; You have Diablo number one. &gt;&gt; It's evil then number two. &gt;&gt; A bit more evil. &gt;&gt; So they make sure that the people get used to these things. So, so they come in stages. Amen. &gt;&gt; To kill &gt;&gt; a child of today, &gt;&gt; brainwash him or her, &gt;&gt; brainwash him or her. And of course, it will start with mind control. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until &gt;&gt; they don't have their own convictions. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now number three. Number three. &gt;&gt; Number four. &gt;&gt; Number four. &gt;&gt; I don't know if number five has come already, &gt;&gt; but number four has killed people. I' I've got records on it how it has killed some people both young and old and yet the people will never quit. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In life life is like this. Um we used to climb the body mountain. First thing you standing before a mountain you don't see the other side then you start climbing as you are going up you are growing taller when you reach the top of the mountain now you are taller than the mountain then now you can see beyond and up and the four quarters that's why the Lord decided to take James and Peter and he led them to the top of the mountain there was a reason for that &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh the more you go higher, &gt;&gt; the more you grow taller. &gt;&gt; And when they reach the mountain, um there appeared Moses &gt;&gt; and Elijah &gt;&gt; because they were now on top. Now where when they are on top the only visible thing was supernatural as you go beyond the seven churchages so you come to the top then it's supernatural amen for it really changed the three witnesses. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and Peter later said we are eyewitnesses. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were with him on the holy mount. &gt;&gt; Amen. They seen the &gt;&gt; supernatural Genesis 18. &gt;&gt; Oh, now I was trying to say &gt;&gt; a young man is just trapped between his infancy and maturity. That's a young man. He cannot see like an old man. Amen. Uh &gt;&gt; at this age uh I will read in the Bible the only God he can worship is himself. If he is without God, he he will worship himself. I've read the magazines trying to see who says what and what says who. Then I realized that we we have some magazines where you find young people revealing their insight and I realize that this is the end of time. They speak of their dreams to follow. I have a dream to follow. Now dreams &gt;&gt; they come during the night the devil. &gt;&gt; If you walk around the night in the night that is the time the devil is also roaming about. is the prince of darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now if talking about dreams, &gt;&gt; you are talking about night time. &gt;&gt; During the day, five senses active. &gt;&gt; When you go to sleep, &gt;&gt; your nervous system system shuts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Such off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the subconscious &gt;&gt; takes over. &gt;&gt; That's when you start to dream. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now sometimes the dreams they are coming from the daily happenings. thoughts of the day. You are thinking of how you'd want to look like. You are comparing yourself with some other people and things and you want to emerge as somebody. You want to look better. and dress better and better hairstyle and all. Now when you go to sleep now the channel opens up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh what do you call that channel &gt;&gt; inside the subconscious &gt;&gt; channel subconscious &gt;&gt; channel subconscious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then tomorrow he or she will say I've got a dream to follow. He's a young man or a young woman. He's just looking at a mountain. He doesn't see or she doesn't see the other side of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so now uh because if there is this side and uh and the top side that's where you can see both sides. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can say I was blind. Now I can see all right. &gt;&gt; I was a sinner, &gt;&gt; but now I'm no longer a sinner. Brother Gama taught me something in Zulu. the word saying walk towards a rock. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means a plowing &gt;&gt; towards a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you can't see the other side then you are plowing towards the rock. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I was trying to read something here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know there was Einstein Einstein &gt;&gt; um doing his probings &gt;&gt; and he came to a place where he he said things like this &gt;&gt; that there is a place &gt;&gt; where all things came from. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Albert Einstein. &gt;&gt; Albert Einstein. &gt;&gt; He has seen that &gt;&gt; he he studied the law of light. &gt;&gt; So he followed this. Then the prophet of God &gt;&gt; when he saw that &gt;&gt; then he said &gt;&gt; Einstein &gt;&gt; Einstein &gt;&gt; uh his experience &gt;&gt; only if it was supernatural &gt;&gt; spiritual &gt;&gt; it would help. But now if it is only physical, it doesn't help because he has a scope. He uses his advanced scope. He is the only one seeing that. Now the other person down there has to rely on his experience. But he he hasn't seen it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Einstein sits down and write a book. &gt;&gt; He has seen it. &gt;&gt; Now with God, it's not like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh it's not just one individual seeing something. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; and you he graduates &gt;&gt; and so forth. And uh as I said in Malawi Malawi &gt;&gt; that a man who who study a flower &gt;&gt; how it germinates and bring forth from the seed to the stock and what else And uh he will look at the flower every day and uh how it is sucking minerals the roots and so forth. Now the teacher actually is this flower. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This man is learning from the flower and say now now let me see how do you produce leaves now. So the flower will show him and is busy writing you know and so forth. But after that the man graduates and the poor flower gets nothing. But actually the person who must graduate is the flower. &gt;&gt; It is the flower that taught him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see these things. It is just like the children of today being groomed up by parents. They go to university &gt;&gt; to Scotland Scotland. &gt;&gt; They come with DTC. &gt;&gt; Then they start to look down to their parents. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. any everything that a parent would say h or she will say it is because my mom my mama is not educated he doesn't see things you know the way I see them my daddy he's done only standard six he's an undergraduate &gt;&gt; yeah he doesn't see things you know the way we see them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then that's when the father &gt;&gt; will produce a photo of this child in his Neptune. [applause] &gt;&gt; Remember the day you you were born. &gt;&gt; Where were you? Do you see yourself? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like that. &gt;&gt; They come to church. &gt;&gt; A pastor will teach them trying to become a father to them. Then at the same time they are going to school. Amen. Amen. After they have graduated, they look at the pastor like this. They are the who are supposed to be the their father. &gt;&gt; Then they become fatherless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now if they are fatherless, &gt;&gt; anybody can swim them because they don't have direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are fatherless. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know whom they should hear. No. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fatherless children. Amen. &gt;&gt; You get what I mean? &gt;&gt; All right. This is the age that we are living in. &gt;&gt; They think they know. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first wisdom is fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first Fear of the Lord &gt;&gt; is the first wisdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you seen a young person will pursue a a career or or he has a dream that I want to be this and that and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he will reach that pl that spot and maybe he is employed in the government or whatever and the next time he is arrested for corruption because education don't make you wise. Amen. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even during the night today, &gt;&gt; the robers when they mark you, &gt;&gt; they mark you in English. &gt;&gt; Lie down. Hold up. right down &gt;&gt; because they are educated. &gt;&gt; So education &gt;&gt; don't make you wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Education without God &gt;&gt; is a hindrance. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take one anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; There will be a divorce, &gt;&gt; a this and this because everything they can just sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you find a mama selling some peanuts there. Have you seen one of them being arrested for corruption? No, &gt;&gt; it's only the guys with some PH what and GTV and what else? Okay, because they are standing before a mountain, they can't see the other side. You get what I mean &gt;&gt; now? That's why in the Bible &gt;&gt; uh the old men &gt;&gt; Paul, Peter, &gt;&gt; Elijah, Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look at this man and even even if one wants desires &gt;&gt; to be a minister or a pastor, &gt;&gt; the Bible says he should he should not be a novice &gt;&gt; a novice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Amen. He will get puff up and try to introduce and inject his own things in the word of God. Amen. Because he's a novice. He's not a grown up. Now, when a person is grown up, he's thinking of the things that are beyond Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. And the Bible says &gt;&gt; they shall heap upon themselves teachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because &gt;&gt; let me say tell read something to you &gt;&gt; now. Now, now you listen to this man and his son. Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 22 verse 22. &gt;&gt; Flee flee also youthful lusts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the youthful lusts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh when they come to that age They have youthful lusts. &gt;&gt; I found one in a court having accused his mother saying &gt;&gt; my mother has kicked me out of the house. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think the brother was there. I don't know whether he's here. I was just in that place. &gt;&gt; And the mother says he comes uh maybe in the middle of the night home. He wants to do whatever he wants to do. If I talk to him, he says then I'm going. &gt;&gt; Then I said, Well, if you want to go, go. Now, today he says I kicked him out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, what a waste of time. &gt;&gt; The BI the Bible says children, &gt;&gt; honor your mama and your daddy. Amen. Amen. And the Bible also don't mention this to the police. &gt;&gt; The Bible said &gt;&gt; spare the rot spoil the child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Spare the rod. Amen. But the people rights came and said he's got this child has got the rights. &gt;&gt; Which rights? Because if it's not parental rights, if it's not God's rights, no which rights, &gt;&gt; you get what I mean? &gt;&gt; Then that's why He comes 12:00 believing that it's his rights. That's right. False and evil rights that leading him to doomsday. To the doomsday. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every person and myself and myself too. Without Christ, we are not we are not in our right mind. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the creator, &gt;&gt; you are not in your right mind. I can prove that to you. You know, amen. That's why the Bible speaks of the thoughts of your heart, &gt;&gt; not your five senses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that so? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your five senses. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm looking at the clock. I must close here. But I was trying to say something here. &gt;&gt; Let me read it to you. &gt;&gt; That is the father coming to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Who was childless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh verse 10, &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:10. And he said that is God said, "I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life. And lo Sarah, thy wife shall have a son." And Sarah had it in the tent door which was behind him. Hallelujah. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age. And it sees to be and it ceases to be with Sarah after the manner of women. &gt;&gt; H therefore Sarah left laughed within herself saying after I have become old shall I have pleasure with my lord my my my lord being old also. And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore Sarah left, saying, Shall I of sorry bear a child whom I'm old? Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we were trying to show that &gt;&gt; something here, but then let's read something because we I must &gt;&gt; [music]
