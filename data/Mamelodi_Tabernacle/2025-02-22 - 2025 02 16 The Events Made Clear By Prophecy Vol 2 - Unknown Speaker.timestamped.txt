[57:06] to normally when you get to the
[57:09] place the sisters are the one that
[57:12] received
[57:13] Mage but something vice
[57:17] versa it was in a place
[57:21] called the highest place
[57:24] ever where we normally snow is in that
[57:29] area so keep on praying for this
[57:32] Miss and then God will bless
[57:35] you amen amen before I read the
[57:40] scripture I just want to give you my
[57:43] personal
[57:46] testimony what I've seen God did in my
[57:51] life well I'm
[57:54] Waking my head office is here
[57:58] Inon now in 2021
[58:01] November they sent me to liting back in
[58:04] the
[58:06] mind to run safety in the
[58:11] project is the most difficult job
[58:15] inject but when I left my house I spoke
[58:19] to the
[58:20] pastor spoke
[58:22] to and then the bo here home
[58:27] to be with us in
[58:29] prayer since we
[58:31] started until this is the fourth
[58:34] year something amazing
[58:38] happen those that run the project
[58:41] here person I used to talk about it
[58:44] normally
[58:47] is he knows what I'm talking
[58:50] about in our
[58:52] experience there was never a project
[58:56] that can go beyond two
[58:59] years without
[59:02] injuries something must happen and we
[59:05] are used to that I saw God did a good
[59:09] thing or an amazing thing in the fourth
[59:13] year since I was there in the
[59:16] mind there was no
[59:19] in
[59:22] amen not even a first AG oh
[59:31] the people safety managers of other
[59:35] project came to me because they had many
[59:40] injuries but my team never when they
[59:45] come to me they said to me how did you
[59:48] do
[59:49] it because there's something that you
[59:53] see something that you know
[59:57] something that you do for things go
[1:00:01] intact because when they check an annual
[1:00:05] safety
[1:00:08] record they saw us being the
[1:00:12] lead and they gave us the
[1:00:15] trophy and this one came to me and said
[1:00:18] next year the trophy will
[1:00:20] be then I just said to him I was
[1:00:24] smiling said as long as I'm in this
[1:00:28] project I will take all the
[1:00:30] trophies then he
[1:00:33] said so
[1:00:36] 2024 the Mind gave us another
[1:00:40] truth then he look at me he said there
[1:00:44] must be a
[1:00:45] secret then there was a meeting because
[1:00:49] when they asked me in the
[1:00:51] meeting everybody was there then I
[1:00:54] answered
[1:00:56] I said to them I I I don't have anything
[1:00:59] to tell
[1:01:00] you that I can say you need to do
[1:01:05] this and that because that's what you
[1:01:08] are
[1:01:10] expecting that you must Shout at the
[1:01:13] people do the assessment you must be
[1:01:17] hands
[1:01:18] on I said to them I've done none but
[1:01:22] what I do when I left my house
[1:01:26] I said to
[1:01:28] God be with me and the team that is the
[1:01:33] first them the second thing the second
[1:01:37] thing every day when I go to work I call
[1:01:41] upon his
[1:01:42] name and before I
[1:01:45] sleep I call upon his name and then that
[1:01:49] is the only
[1:01:51] secret and they say if that is the
[1:01:54] case it's not for us then I said to them
[1:01:59] true is not for you but it's for me
[1:02:03] because it's my way of life that why God
[1:02:07] is even showing you that when you are in
[1:02:10] his
[1:02:11] way will be the
[1:02:14] result I just want to thank
[1:02:18] for to see God protecting
[1:02:22] us in premises
[1:02:27] so last
[1:02:29] week the Mind
[1:02:31] manager asked me to pray in the
[1:02:35] management
[1:02:38] meeting in my prayer I said normally
[1:02:42] they complain about
[1:02:48] gbv then I said that can be
[1:02:53] conquered only if you the manager said
[1:02:56] in the
[1:02:57] prayer only you the Mind
[1:03:01] manager you call us any more
[1:03:06] colleagues but through this prayer we
[1:03:09] must call each
[1:03:11] other brothers and
[1:03:15] sisters so last week

[1:08:04] his belly and his thighs of brass his
[1:08:07] legs of iron his feet part of iron and
[1:08:10] part of clay thou sawest till that a

[1:08:18] the image upon his feet that were of

[1:08:34] the summer threshing flows and the winds
[1:08:38] carry them away that no place was found

[1:09:48] themselves with a seed of men but they
[1:09:51] shall not live one to another even as
[1:09:54] iron is not mixed with L and in the days
[1:09:58] of these Kings shall the god of Heaven
[1:10:00] set up a kingdom which shall never be
[1:10:03] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[1:10:06] left to other people but it shall break
[1:10:09] in pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:10:13] and it shall stand forever
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:50] amen amen amen verse
[1:10:53] 45 amen verse 45
[1:11:18] amen may God bless you I'm bringing the
[1:11:22] part
[1:11:23] two of the message I promised
[1:11:27] previously about events made clear by
[1:11:35] prophecies where Daniel had a
[1:11:39] dream or the king had a
[1:11:42] dream nebz had a
[1:11:46] dream Daniel had to
[1:11:50] interpret the dream but before he
[1:11:53] interpreted dream
[1:11:55] he has to tell the
[1:11:57] king what he dreamed
[1:12:00] about until all the people of
[1:12:04] Babylon said to the king no man from
[1:12:08] this world can tell you that
[1:12:11] dream explain it and explain it only God
[1:12:17] alone so goded upon
[1:12:21] Daniel gave him the dream
[1:12:25] the interpretation there amen so last
[1:12:29] time we spoke until to the
[1:12:35] is because we had
[1:12:38] Babylon and we've got
[1:12:40] Greece we've got
[1:12:43] met we've got Rome that was the kingdom
[1:12:47] of
[1:12:48] iron that's where we stopped and
[1:12:52] today we will leave those one
[1:12:56] behind and talk about
[1:13:00] clay and
[1:13:02] ir and about the clay and
[1:13:07] iron we will
[1:13:09] focus on the
[1:13:12] stone the stone that was cut
[1:13:17] out without
[1:13:21] hands and hit the image
[1:13:25] on
[1:13:26] theot amen amen so we'll talk about that
[1:13:29] stone
[1:13:30] today amen amen looking at the spoken
[1:13:35] with what brother
[1:13:37] say I remember
[1:13:40] previously we were looking at the
[1:13:43] prophecies that brother
[1:13:47] prophesied we saw all of
[1:13:49] them being
[1:13:52] fulfilled nothing is Left Behind
[1:13:56] I remember Pastor when was behind the
[1:13:58] pit last
[1:14:00] week he was saying the people used to
[1:14:03] reject brother
[1:14:06] B but today looking at what America is
[1:14:13] saying Russia is saying what is
[1:14:16] happening in
[1:14:18] californ to
[1:14:20] check why these things are
[1:14:23] happening and when they
[1:14:26] start to realize that there was a man by
[1:14:30] the name of
[1:14:31] William who spoke about this thing and
[1:14:35] now they are
[1:14:38] precise when you go to the
[1:14:41] YouTube Google anywhere is the voice of
[1:14:45] the
[1:14:46] Prophet because they've started to
[1:14:49] realiz this man only him said these
[1:14:53] things and
[1:14:57] happened amen amen it tells you that the
[1:15:01] time is no more anytime the Rapture can
[1:15:05] take but before the Rapture can
[1:15:08] take the CL and the iron should show as
[1:15:13] their
[1:15:15] colors the kingdom that should stand
[1:15:21] eternity should
[1:15:23] start because theend of this
[1:15:26] time it should be the beginning of
[1:15:30] ET well uh let me read what brother
[1:15:35] says on the 1th week of
[1:15:38] Daniel for you to understand what this
[1:15:42] rock
[1:15:43] is amen amen he said now notice in here
[1:15:48] at the end of this
[1:15:50] age now Daniel in the 2 chapter 34 and
[1:15:54] 35
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:59] he watched this
[1:16:01] image with great
[1:16:05] consideration and he watched until a
[1:16:07] stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:16:09] without
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:15] hands and it rolls down and smoke the
[1:16:20] image in the
[1:16:22] feet and broke it
[1:16:25] it never hit it on the head
[1:16:28] now hit it on the
[1:16:31] feet that was the end
[1:16:34] time them 10
[1:16:39] to amen before Jesus Christ was
[1:16:44] born there were
[1:16:47] kingdoms the kingdom of
[1:16:50] Babylon of M and
[1:16:53] pers of the G
[1:16:56] and when Jesus was
[1:16:57] born was born during the time of the
[1:17:00] ruling of
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:03] Rome during the time of
[1:17:07] ir during the hardship of
[1:17:11] worship he was born during that
[1:17:14] time died during that time ascended
[1:17:18] during
[1:17:19] that now the
[1:17:21] iron is stronger than all the previous
[1:17:35] amen was
[1:17:37] ruling the entire
[1:17:40] world to the world to the end of the
[1:17:43] world
[1:17:45] somehow somewhere it get
[1:17:49] compromised we see the
[1:17:52] CL covering the eye
[1:17:55] the iron is still there but the CL is on
[1:18:00] top you no longer see it with the naked
[1:18:08] eye did you
[1:18:10] notice exactly here just
[1:18:14] before
[1:18:17] Mr went out the the last
[1:18:23] Protestant of America
[1:18:25] in the Pres in the
[1:18:28] president which I
[1:18:31] doubt ever be another
[1:18:34] one but when just to show that just if
[1:18:39] people would wake
[1:18:41] up when he
[1:18:43] met the last meeting he met with
[1:18:50] Russia there were five eastern
[1:18:52] communistic count represented
[1:18:59] five Western
[1:19:02] countries Mr
[1:19:04] CRF was the head of the Eastern
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:11] country
[1:19:14] Mr was the head of the western
[1:19:18] count and
[1:19:20] CRF as I
[1:19:22] understand and Been Told
[1:19:25] that in Russia the language means
[1:19:31] CL and means IR
[1:19:37] English there's your iron and
[1:19:42] cl will not
[1:19:45] mix and he pulled off his
[1:19:48] shoe and beat it the stand with
[1:19:53] it and everything
[1:19:55] else it won't
[1:19:58] miss but it's in the last
[1:20:01] days of this
[1:20:03] Empire that The Rock
[1:20:06] sto that was healed out of the
[1:20:11] mountain without
[1:20:14] hand SM the
[1:20:17] image in the
[1:20:20] feet amen amen amen well in the olden
[1:20:25] days even South Africa we were colonized
[1:20:29] by
[1:20:31] British amen amen and they were fighting
[1:20:34] with the
[1:20:36] buas amen amen there were time of
[1:20:40] Germany there were time of
[1:20:42] friends and
[1:20:45] Etc but since the CL is
[1:20:50] there and the IR is there they stand
[1:20:55] because it's
[1:20:56] scriptural Germany will come and
[1:20:59] pass France will come and
[1:21:02] F Great Britain will come
[1:21:06] and but Rome will stand until God
[1:21:16] himself amen amen it happened there
[1:21:20] withen
[1:21:22] andf it's now here
[1:21:25] with Donald Trump Donald Trump andir
[1:21:30] pu amen amen I think last week they were
[1:21:35] talking about the war in Ukraine they
[1:21:38] want to stop it Donald Trump Donal TR
[1:21:42] give Putin the condition Putin give
[1:21:46] Donald
[1:21:47] Trump condition and their condition does
[1:21:51] not come to a common ground
[1:21:54] because iron and Clay will never
[1:21:59] meet America and Russia will never
[1:22:05] agree two
[1:22:07] forces two
[1:22:09] Powers but Russia is the hand of
[1:22:13] God Russia is the one that will
[1:22:18] destroy the Rome and America Amica is
[1:22:23] the hand of God
[1:22:25] like
[1:22:26] nebz the of God punish
[1:22:31] Israel the last Kingdom of the CL is the
[1:22:36] hand of
[1:22:37] God to punish this
[1:22:41] Kingdom as brother Bram say the first
[1:22:45] messenger was Paul the last
[1:22:48] messenger myself we are the hands of
[1:22:53] God open the church
[1:22:55] ages I close the church ages When I
[1:22:59] close the church ages there's no other
[1:23:02] church is the life eternal is the
[1:23:06] wedding serer is the Millennium is the
[1:23:09] Eternal new
[1:23:13] jerusem amen amen so today don't be
[1:23:17] fooled what America is saying what
[1:23:21] Russia is saying go back the scriptures
[1:23:26] go back to the spoken way and hear what
[1:23:30] the prophet say that's where your answer
[1:23:35] is amen amen the word of God says when
[1:23:40] they say oh yeah thank you when they say
[1:23:45] peace peace and peace then
[1:23:49] destruction will
[1:23:51] come there is no other peace
[1:23:56] amen I remember when we were coming
[1:24:01] from we were talking in the Bible in the
[1:24:05] car then we were
[1:24:07] talking about how things are what
[1:24:11] brother say he said even
[1:24:15] America
[1:24:17] if can find the
[1:24:20] best of the best president

[1:35:43] question why this
[1:35:46] Stone you know was all
[1:35:51] over and the Bible says
[1:35:54] there was no sea or
[1:35:58] ocean did you ask
[1:36:00] yourself why there was no
[1:36:03] se if you did not thought about
[1:36:07] them but think
[1:36:09] about the two million
[1:36:13] demons that were
[1:36:15] caught in the
[1:36:19] river think of
[1:36:21] Hitler when he killed the
[1:36:24] Jewish and those demons were bound
[1:36:30] there the
[1:36:32] ocean and the rivers and the DS and the
[1:36:37] lakes is where the demon
[1:36:41] hi in the city to
[1:36:44] come the demons do not have the
[1:36:50] hiding that is the reason
[1:36:54] the demons hide there and the Bible
[1:36:57] backs you
[1:36:59] up there were demons that were bind in
[1:37:03] the
[1:37:04] river God said to Moses go to
[1:37:08] River before Pharaoh get there because
[1:37:13] Pharaoh himself is that big snake in the
[1:37:17] river he's connecting with it that is
[1:37:21] why in the city to come there's no
[1:37:24] n there's no Atlantic Ocean there's no
[1:37:29] hiding place for the
[1:37:31] demons Stone coming from the mountain

[1:55:18] from a stone to a city to a city
[1:55:24] etal when we are worshiping this morning
[1:55:28] when we are trying this and
[1:55:31] this we are
[1:55:34] longing to be in that
[1:55:39] se amen amen and brother BR came and
[1:55:44] give us the
[1:55:46] confirmation and said that seat belong
[1:55:50] to you that seat
[1:55:52] it's yourself the ruler is Christ
[1:55:57] Jesus you are the bride you know the
[1:56:00] bride and the
[1:56:02] groom are very much
[1:56:04] important that is why those that
[1:56:07] normally I took to them about marriages
[1:56:11] I will stick on one
[1:56:12] thing I will stick on one thing amen a
[1:56:17] man who does not
[1:56:19] protect his own wife
[1:56:23] I have a problem with
[1:56:26] you
[1:56:30] because brother you find and the mother
[1:56:34] and the
[1:56:35] sisters ganging
[1:56:39] up now
[1:56:42] the the only
[1:56:45] protector
[1:56:48] the when I hear that
[1:56:52] I really get
[1:57:01] frustrated let's talk trth the Bible
[1:57:04] says we are
[1:57:06] sinners you know saved by grace who
[1:57:10] saved
[1:57:11] us who saved us is Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:57:16] our sinful life and he made us whole He
[1:57:21] protected us
[1:57:23] to the
[1:57:25] devil
[1:57:27] irrespective of the wrongs you
[1:57:29] commit Christ Jesus protected
[1:57:34] you why if you think your wife wrong you
[1:57:39] you don't protect
[1:57:40] it you not felling
[1:57:46] some because the natural type the
[1:57:50] spiritual
[1:57:54] be like Adam When sin came into house
[1:57:59] with if you will say I will redeem
[1:58:03] it that unconditional
[1:58:09] love it mustn't go with condition
[1:58:12] because you are having a holy attitude
[1:58:23] Christ Jesus protected us you are here
[1:58:27] this morning because he
[1:58:30] protected and he build a city for
[1:58:34] you we will be with him in that City to
[1:58:39] come when we walk we are looking up to
[1:58:43] that City things of the world are no
[1:58:47] longer touching us because we are
[1:58:49] looking at that
[1:58:52] we have hit the point of no
[1:58:56] return amen amen have you seen somebody
[1:59:01] dying when he died seeing the way he is
[1:59:06] taking you can pray you can fast you can
[1:59:11] do anything you are not going to help
[1:59:14] him he hit the point of no
[1:59:20] return and can I say something all of us
[1:59:25] here all of us even those that are
[1:59:28] streaming we have hit the point of no
[1:59:34] return those that follow
[1:59:37] Christ following him those that do not
[1:59:40] follow Christ are not following him we
[1:59:43] cannot help them they cannot help us we
[1:59:47] are on the point of no return
[1:59:57] Judas cannot
[1:59:59] change I normally
[2:00:03] say a character of a
[2:00:06] person it's him and brother Bram says
[2:00:10] our names in the city to come is our
[2:00:16] character but a behavior of a
[2:00:19] person is what you can change
[2:00:23] but you cannot change the
[2:00:26] character because the character of a
[2:00:28] person is who he
[2:00:32] is if you were a son and a daughter of
[2:00:36] the Living
[2:00:38] God to begin with what is going to
[2:00:41] change you nothing can change you you
[2:00:45] are in the journey the word of God came
[2:00:49] to make you recognize
[2:00:52] who you are and you continue with
[2:00:57] [Applause]

[2:01:03] realm and they don't come to the on
[2:01:06] realm to the free way they have taken
[2:01:10] their
[2:01:12] way are we still Bible

[2:01:23] Jesus Christ look at the young man and
[2:01:27] Lov him when he loved him and wishes him
[2:01:33] to come to the city to come but the
[2:01:36] young man said to the city to come is
[2:01:40] not my
[2:01:43] city when that conversation was
[2:01:46] like sell what you
