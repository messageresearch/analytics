[57:09] beginning amen
[57:13] says when God created the world in the
[57:18] beginning I don't know how many years or
[57:21] billions of years or that
[57:27] there in the
[57:29] beginning so even if they say the Earth
[57:31] is billion years old don't worry it's
[57:34] all
[57:36] [Music]
[57:38] right it's our time which we are
[57:41] counting we're not counting the creation
[57:43] of the
[57:46] earth if you want to find the
[57:49] quotation um you can go to 63
[57:54] 1229 there is

[58:31] talking about
[58:34] us amen amen when said let there be
[58:39] light hallelujah amen hallelujah
[58:44] amen
[58:47] today
[58:48] our my whole
[58:52] aim of the whole message
[58:56] is to let you
[58:57] know when God said let there be
[59:01] light he was talking about
[59:06] you amen amen
[59:13] amen it's going to give me trouble can
[59:16] you go down a little bit go down go
[59:21] down yes 62 now some people argue today
[59:25] in our schools
[59:28] about the world being so many million
[59:30] years old trying to condemn the
[59:35] Bible they just never read the Bible
[59:38] That's all because the Bible don't tell
[59:41] us how old the world
[59:45] is the Bible said in the beginning God
[59:49] created the heavens and the
[59:54] earth when
[59:59] how we don't know
[1:00:01] it now that's
[1:00:04] first and that's
[1:00:06] period that's the end of the
[1:00:11] sentence in the beginning God created
[1:00:13] the heavens and the
[1:00:15] Earth it might have been 100 million
[1:00:19] years whatever it was how done
[1:00:23] it that's up to him
[1:00:26] to know see not to
[1:00:32] me Allelujah amen that's not up to me to
[1:00:36] know how he created
[1:00:38] the for me I have to know how he will
[1:00:41] save
[1:00:45] me you know we are so
[1:00:49] blind we we are very completely
[1:00:53] blind um as I was saying
[1:00:57] yesterday they can take a telescope put
[1:00:59] it in a blind spot where this
[1:01:03] Darkness they find that there are
[1:01:05] billions and billions of galaxies
[1:01:11] there amen so we are men every day we
[1:01:16] discover new
[1:01:18] things amen amen uh just two days
[1:01:22] ago they discover something which was uh
[1:01:25] very important
[1:01:29] which they didn't
[1:01:31] know they call they call it
[1:01:35] Point amen point is where the pool of
[1:01:40] the Earth and the Sun are
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:45] equal you can go and stay there without
[1:01:49] spending much
[1:01:50] energy because not be pulling
[1:01:54] much that's they did put the J
[1:01:59] telescope it's there forever because
[1:02:01] it's in
[1:02:04] point God already knew there was such
[1:02:08] point because it's him who created the
[1:02:11] world so we are discuss so new
[1:02:16] things but come to the word they don't
[1:02:20] give chance to the way to change them
[1:02:26] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so we go
[1:02:29] back to 59 on the same scripture my
[1:02:33] brother9 59 yes let me start from
[1:02:37] there now
[1:02:40] remember light comes by the spoken
[1:02:49] word what how does light
[1:02:52] come the spoken words
[1:02:56] yes
[1:02:58] amen light is the
[1:03:01] Vindication or the subject that he
[1:03:06] spoke is
[1:03:09] light when light
[1:03:13] flies shows that God said let there be
[1:03:17] light there was no light he said let
[1:03:21] there be light and there was light
[1:03:25] that's a
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:29] proof the light is a Vindication of the
[1:03:32] spoken
[1:03:36] word the same thing
[1:03:39] today Vindication of his spoken
[1:03:46] word hallelujah amen so let's discuss
[1:03:50] another
[1:03:52] chapter when Isaiah said
[1:03:56] Isaiah 6:1 Isaiah 6:1 let's go
[1:04:05] there s arise Shine for thy light is
[1:04:09] come amen and the glory of the Lord is
[1:04:12] raisen upon theme amen hallelujah
[1:04:16] amen was he talking about the
[1:04:20] son no he was talking about
[1:04:24] himself that he was the
[1:04:26] light to the
[1:04:30] Jews amen hallelujah
[1:04:33] amen he was light to the
[1:04:37] Jews so when you see his word being the
[1:04:42] let me be there when you see his word
[1:04:45] being
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:48] Vindicated or in other
[1:04:51] words made
[1:04:53] known or proved
[1:04:57] that
[1:04:58] is the light of his spoken
[1:05:04] word when our young
[1:05:07] people the
[1:05:11] way they are telling the
[1:05:14] world this is
[1:05:20] light and without
[1:05:22] light nothing can live without light
[1:05:28] all the life which is on
[1:05:30] Earth is
[1:05:32] there because there's a
[1:05:35] sun okay let me stop there I hope I
[1:05:39] remember to come back to this amen um
[1:05:44] the sun which you
[1:05:46] see uh
[1:05:48] today uh the
[1:05:50] sun is a huge star which about a million
[1:05:54] can go in there
[1:06:00] the nuclear fusion which happens in the
[1:06:04] sun to give us light
[1:06:09] today
[1:06:10] happened about 10 to 100 million years
[1:06:16] ago just imagine God already Was
[1:06:19] preparing a
[1:06:21] son which seeing today
[1:06:26] when did that nuclear fusion happen
[1:06:28] which is giving us light
[1:06:32] today tell it happened long time
[1:06:38] ago tell me that there's nobody who
[1:06:42] planned
[1:06:44] this this is all
[1:06:47] planned it's all
[1:06:51] synchronized hallelujah amen you are not
[1:06:54] here by mistake
[1:06:56] so when the sun
[1:07:00] came when the sun comes to the
[1:07:03] Earth there is a way which we trap the
[1:07:09] energy when we how we trap the
[1:07:12] energy it's through the
[1:07:15] plants and we change the energy from the
[1:07:19] plants to become our food that's why
[1:07:22] they call the food chain
[1:07:26] so that's a way we live on on on the
[1:07:30] sun without this
[1:07:33] light nothing can
[1:07:37] live there's no life upon the
[1:07:40] Earth but that has come by the Light of
[1:07:43] the
[1:07:47] Sun in a b life
[1:07:51] so
[1:07:53] and there is no
[1:07:56] eternal
[1:07:58] life outside the
[1:08:00] sun of
[1:08:04] God amen amen we are going to talk about
[1:08:07] that he is the
[1:08:10] light amen amen so it is the light it is
[1:08:14] our
[1:08:17] light hallelujah

[1:18:17] time the devil is trying to make sure he
[1:18:20] brings back the denominationalism into
[1:18:22] the message of the hour
[1:18:27] because he has to fight the
[1:18:33] message if I am a

[1:20:46] we are not Kings
[1:20:48] only we are priest
[1:20:52] Kings we need to rule
[1:20:55] but at the same time be
[1:21:00] intercessors and people have known the
[1:21:01] word of the hour so
[1:21:05] much but
[1:21:07] unfortunately instead of becoming an
[1:21:11] intercessor they become a
[1:21:16] prut do you know what the prut
[1:21:19] doesn't we found him we found him we
[1:21:24] found
[1:21:25] and we have
[1:21:32] evidence and sometimes they even go on
[1:21:34] to not only to become prosecutors but
[1:21:36] being
[1:21:41] persecutors that's
[1:21:46] denominationalism amen
[1:21:50] amen that's the same thing with the word
[1:21:58] with the
[1:22:00] word when the word of God
[1:22:03] lies it is the rising of the
[1:22:06] sun
[1:22:10] theising all
[1:22:14] Superstition denomination of
[1:22:18] fism and things spread away it shows
[1:22:23] exactly
[1:22:25] what it is what in the beginning
[1:22:30] say let there be
[1:22:33] light amen
[1:22:35] amen God separated
[1:22:40] light from
[1:22:42] darkness in the beginning hallelujah
[1:22:45] amen amen um those of you who have got
[1:22:50] houses especially sisters you go to the
[1:22:52] kitchen
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:56] go there at
[1:22:57] night you might find that there's a
[1:22:59] fellow small Fellowship
[1:23:05] there just turn on the
[1:23:11] light you see the Ls going that
[1:23:15] way going that way they can't stand the
[1:23:19] lights
[1:23:25] amen they can't stand the
[1:23:29] light the light separates
[1:23:35] us amen amen amen
[1:23:40] amen so in the
[1:23:43] beginning God said Let It Be
[1:23:47] Right amen amen let's go to John 8 12
[1:23:54] John
[1:24:04] 8:12 then spake Jesus again unto them
[1:24:07] saying yes I am the light of the world
[1:24:10] Hallelujah he that followeth me shall
[1:24:12] not walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:24:15] light of Life hallelujah amen amen amen
[1:24:19] amen hallelujah amen uh let's go back to
[1:24:23] the same creation again
[1:24:27] um
[1:24:29] when Jesus is the
[1:24:31] light hallelujah amen but him being the
[1:24:36] light he
[1:24:38] attracts
[1:24:42] otherss
[1:24:46] others put on lights of your
[1:24:52] headlamps you see creatures of life
[1:24:56] learning towards
[1:24:58] you creatures of
[1:25:00] Darkness learning isn't it hallelujah
[1:25:04] amen so when the creatures of
[1:25:08] light come in the
[1:25:10] light you can see them not because they
[1:25:13] got
[1:25:14] light because the light is reflecting on
[1:25:21] them hallelujah amen the light of the
[1:25:24] real
[1:25:26] light is reflecting upon
[1:25:32] them so you might be somewhere
[1:25:36] in the Sun is
[1:25:39] far but they can see the
[1:25:43] reflection on someone who is attracted
[1:25:47] by the
[1:25:50] Light even if the light is far
[1:25:55] um if you can go on the planet uh let's
[1:25:58] just take
[1:26:01] Mars uh the Earth is mostly glass
[1:26:04] because it's made of water and the
[1:26:10] clouds so on the Maran
[1:26:14] night if you see a very huge B star in
[1:26:18] the in the sky
[1:26:24] planet
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:27] Earth because the
[1:26:29] Earth is working in the
[1:26:32] light and is able to give
[1:26:35] light to those who are in
[1:26:39] darkness first the Earth has to
[1:26:43] be in the
