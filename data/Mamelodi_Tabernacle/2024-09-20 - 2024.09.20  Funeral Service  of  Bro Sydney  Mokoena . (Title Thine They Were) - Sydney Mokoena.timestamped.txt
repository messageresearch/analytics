[36:50] [Music]
[37:19] than for
[37:28] are we
[37:29] audible I will just continue talking as
[37:33] they are fixing the
[37:47] mic
[37:52] hello amen
[38:08] why are we using
[38:25] English fellow
[38:43] they are live
[38:48] streaming trying to accommodate some
[38:50] other
[38:52] people that inland
[38:57] and some are even in another part of of
[39:01] the count different
[39:05] countries so that is the
[39:08] reason we are using
[39:12] English so we would like to create the
[39:17] family and the their neighbors
[39:23] too and and everybody that is here
[39:28] we are here just to
[39:31] have some few words of
[39:34] [Music]
[39:37] fellowship before maybe we go to the
[39:41] cemetery may the Lord bless
[39:44] you we will always read on the
[39:49] scriptures because that's where the life
[39:53] is especially in moments like this
[39:59] I would like to read John chapter
[40:05] 17 and then I will read verse 6 and
[40:11] S John 17 John chapter 17 I'll read only
[40:16] verse 6 and S
[40:48] okay it says here in English I have
[40:50] manifested thy name unto the man which
[40:54] thou has givest me
[40:58] uh out of the world thine they were and
[41:02] thou gavest them to me and they have
[41:06] kept my word Thy word now they have
[41:10] known that all things whatsoever thou
[41:13] has given me are of
[41:16] thee shall we bow our heads and and have
[41:21] our
[41:36] [Music]
[41:56] dimension for
[42:35] may be
[42:43] seated okay we are gathered
[42:48] here just to have some uh few
[42:54] words of consolation to the family
[43:02] the
[43:04] family of which we fellowship with
[43:10] them so now there's nobody that can
[43:14] uh have uh good
[43:18] words of condolences except
[43:23] God man comes from God
[43:28] and then he will go back to
[43:30] God so we have read here verse
[43:36] six it's our Lord
[43:39] here he said I have manifested thy name
[43:43] unto the men which thou has given
[43:48] me so he was here to
[43:53] manifest said now I have manifested thy
[43:56] name
[43:58] to the men which thou Gest
[44:01] me out of the
[44:04] world
[44:06] th uh they
[44:09] were that's what I want to speak
[44:12] about that the title will be D they
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] were in other words in other words he
[44:21] says these people are
[44:24] yours mine was just to come and manif
[44:27] your
[44:30] way now if these
[44:32] people are God's
[44:35] people and he come just to manifest his
[44:39] name then they will never lose a
[44:43] direction because he says my sheep hear
[44:47] my
[44:49] voice they will always keep the
[44:53] direction so now our lord Jesus
[44:58] when he was here on
[45:00] Earth was not here to show off that he
[45:04] is
[45:06] Jesus but there was a prophecy about
[45:10] him the prophet
[45:13] says a virgin shall
[45:17] conceive and bear a
[45:19] son now he was he was here to manifest
[45:23] those words
[45:27] the son that was spoken
[45:30] about it's
[45:32] himself but he didn't say the son that
[45:35] was spoken about is my
[45:39] son now he manifested the word of
[45:43] God because Gabriel the angel of
[45:47] God came to
[45:49] Mary and said to
[45:52] Mary thou shall
[45:57] you will bear a
[46:00] child and you and then when she when
[46:03] when he said thou sht bear a
[46:05] child started by saying thou shall
[46:09] conceive and bear a child now those are
[46:13] the words that come from the
[46:17] angel now where did the angel get those
[46:21] words the angel got those wordss from
[46:24] God himself
[46:27] in other words those were the words of
[46:30] God that Mary you will
[46:33] con and bear a
[46:35] son now the
[46:37] son came now to manifest those words
[46:42] that were spoken by the
[46:45] angel are we together now here he
[46:49] says those people are
[46:52] yours says they are thine now I am
[46:57] here to manifest those
[47:00] words in other words he cannot
[47:04] manifest the words that were not spoken
[47:07] by
[47:09] God it's God that says these people are
[47:14] yours and then it's his son that says
[47:19] father I came to manifest your
[47:25] weight that is why now when we are here
[47:29] on the Bible says in the book of
[47:32] Ephesians chapter
[47:34] 1 in verse four he
[47:36] says we were in
[47:39] him are we together amen our life does
[47:42] not start here
[47:47] in our lives has got no
[47:51] beginning are we together
[47:54] amen we were not created
[47:59] no we we were processed from his
[48:03] mind are we together now we were
[48:06] processed from his
[48:08] mind that's why he said now my my my
[48:13] sheep will hear my
[48:15] voice that's why when he says let us
[48:18] make
[48:19] men in our image he was communicating he
[48:23] was talking to
[48:25] us in him himself there was nobody here
[48:29] on
[48:30] Earth the Bible says in the beginning
[48:35] God created heaven and
[48:38] earth before the before everything was
[48:42] there now in in in first in in Ephesians
[48:46] 1 verse 4
[48:49] says we were in
[48:52] him
[48:53] before the foundation of the world
[48:57] now if we were in
[48:59] him before the foundation of the world
[49:02] now before the foundation of the world
[49:05] there was
[49:06] nobody it was God all by himself and his
[49:12] mind so we were with together with him
[49:15] there now if we were together with him
[49:19] there then we will never lose a
[49:23] direction we are his children
[49:27] the Bible says nobody no no one knows
[49:31] the
[49:32] father except the son so the son
[49:38] manifest the son that is the one that is
[49:42] manifesting because he was the one that
[49:44] was in the bosom of the
[49:46] father when you say when the Bible say
[49:49] he was in the bosom of the
[49:52] father it means he was in his father
[49:57] and then his father is the one that
[49:59] processed
[50:00] him now we were together with
[50:04] him that's why now the words of
[50:07] consolation is that one
[50:10] day this is the body of the
[50:13] man that surrender his
[50:17] soul to his
[50:19] creator I always remind people that they
[50:24] have souls
[50:26] lot and number of people are not
[50:31] aware that they are not what they
[50:34] are like I'm sending
[50:37] here I
[50:38] Amana but I know that I'm
[50:41] not are we together Scana is this
[50:45] flesh which is born out of my
[50:48] parents but within me there is a
[50:52] soul then that Soul does not come from
[50:55] my parents
[50:57] that Soul come from my
[50:59] Creator now that I was not created then
[51:03] I was
[51:05] processed then that Soul should
[51:09] be H in
[51:12] line
[51:14] coordinates with the one that has
[51:17] processed
[51:18] me remember God gave us a
[51:22] heart and in that heart there is what we
[51:26] call
[51:27] Soul are we together and when God speaks
[51:31] to us he speaks to us through that Soul
[51:36] remember that we've got a
[51:38] mind the Mind controls the
[51:40] body and when the devil speaks to us he
[51:44] speaks through our mind in the Garden of
[51:48] Eden the the
[51:51] serpent went to to to to
[51:55] Eve and Ted his
[51:58] mind he went to the mind of
[52:02] God mind I mean the mind of of of of
[52:07] Eve and tested the Mind mind is there
[52:11] for
[52:13] argument mind is there for
[52:17] reasoning when we want to reason when we
[52:20] want to argue argue through our minds we
[52:24] argue through our intelligence
[52:27] but God does not come to your
[52:30] intelligence come to your mind God goes
[52:34] right to your
[52:36] heart that's where life is that's who
[52:40] you
[52:41] are you are the
[52:45] soul and that's why God after creating a
[52:50] man he took his soul and put it in that
[52:54] man so that he can communicate
[52:59] when God communicate with you
[53:02] communicates with your
[53:04] mind with your heart thank you my
[53:06] brother are we together but then if God
[53:12] seek your
[53:13] soul and could not find you then we are
[53:17] not
[53:18] his remember there are those that
[53:24] are condemned
[53:27] there are
[53:28] those that are let me put it this
[53:32] way the Bible
[53:35] says there are
[53:39] angels that kept not their
[53:43] first are we together they did not keep
[53:46] their first
[53:48] estate as you are your first estate is
[53:52] the mind of God
[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] the mind of
[53:58] God God gave you an
[54:02] estate and the estate of has to do with
[54:06] the kingdom of
[54:08] God can I repeat myself there are people
[54:13] that are
[54:15] ordained for
[54:18] condemnation you read it in the book of
[54:20] Jude in verse six the the angels that
[54:25] kept not their First
[54:28] Estate they
[54:30] condemned they ordained for
[54:33] condemnation there are those you read it
[54:36] in the book of
[54:38] Acts
[54:40] 13:47 it says there are those that are
[54:44] ordained for eternal
[54:47] life now those that are are ordained for
[54:50] eternal
[54:52] life they are his they will never miss a
[54:56] point
[54:57] they will never
[54:59] miss their
[55:01] creator when their creator calls they
[55:04] could hear that my father is
[55:08] talking but there are those that will
[55:11] never hear his
[55:12] voice they don't even care about his
[55:15] voice they will never care about his
[55:18] voice are we together now the
[55:21] consolation to the family is that the
[55:25] man
[55:28] syney had the
[55:30] voice and surrendered his
[55:33] life now when we console the
[55:36] family we console them through those
[55:39] words that he
[55:43] repented repentance is to give your life
[55:45] over to
[55:47] God and then God have got his own
[55:52] way of directing
[55:54] you how to live
[55:57] and if you don't give your life to
[56:00] God then God cannot direct
[56:03] you God want to have a touch with
[56:07] you god want to have a contact with
[56:11] you god want to speak to
[56:13] you want to you to
[56:16] respond and the response is
[56:19] thisi my Lord and when you say here am I
[56:23] my Lord then you surrender the Bible
[56:26] says he that
[56:30] believe then he should
[56:33] repent and be baptized in the name of my
[56:36] Lord Jesus Christ he that heard the word
[56:39] of
[56:40] God then he
[56:42] repents and be baptized now repentance
[56:46] is to turn around and say now I am not
[56:50] living this type of life now I change
[56:54] now now he's the one that will take care
[56:57] of
[56:59] you God can never take care of you if
[57:03] you are not his own he take care of his
[57:08] own he says my sheep hear my
[57:12] voice when my sheep hear my voice I take
[57:16] care of them that is why now when he was
[57:19] here he said
[57:22] father I have manifested thy name
[57:26] he was yet to manifest thy
[57:29] name unto the man which thou has given
[57:33] out of was given me out of the
[57:37] world you hear what he's saying amen he
[57:40] says I am manifesting
[57:43] only to those
[57:46] men that you have given
[57:49] me right
[57:51] amen thine you have given me those
[57:54] people
[57:56] because they were yours that's why he
[57:58] says dying they
[58:00] were are we together amen and you gave
[58:04] them to me and I then they have kept thy
[58:10] weight there is no way that you can
[58:13] worship god without keeping his
[58:16] way because he's the one that pulls
[58:20] you he's he pulls you towards
[58:24] himself you are not doing a
[58:27] favor it's your life you don't worship
[58:30] God because you want to do him a favor
[58:33] there is no other way that we can do
[58:36] there is no other life that we can
[58:39] live are we
[58:41] together so now he says now in verse S
[58:46] verse now they have known that all thing
[58:51] whatsoever thou has given me are of Thee
[59:00] so all things that God has given
[59:04] you you must know that belongs to
[59:08] him there's nothing that you
[59:11] have except that God gives
[59:18] you right I want to go on with this
[59:21] until verse but before I go there I want
[59:24] to go to verse 39 in in in chapter 6 6
[59:29] ver9 I would like us to know that now uh
[59:36] man does not
[59:39] die yesterday evening I was showing I I
[59:43] was
[59:45] saying talking about the
[59:48] departure if somebody
[59:51] departs like our brother here has
[59:54] Departed
[59:57] then which means then he must come
[1:00:01] back he must return He has
[1:00:05] departed but the dead
[1:00:09] person is the one that will never see
[1:00:12] God
[1:00:14] again maybe to put you in the picture is
[1:00:17] like
[1:00:18] this we are
[1:00:20] here on and if the H arrives just tell
[1:00:23] me I'm looking at the watching
[1:00:28] we are here on this planet
[1:00:31] Earth there is also the world in this
[1:00:37] planet we in this planet
[1:00:40] Earth there is the world in this
[1:00:44] earth now uh if there is a world in this
[1:00:51] earth there are people of the world
[1:00:56] the world is controlling this
[1:00:59] planet and you'll find that most of the
[1:01:03] world is contrary to the word of
[1:01:07] God now why are we waiting for the
[1:01:11] coming of the
[1:01:13] Lord there are people that are so
[1:01:19] ignorant they don't I was also like
[1:01:23] that then they are not aware
[1:01:27] actually where we are right
[1:01:29] now the only thing that they
[1:01:32] know uh is of the
[1:01:35] world is that maybe
[1:01:38] Putin is is fighting with another
[1:01:42] country there's this thing that's
[1:01:45] happening in
[1:01:46] America there's this thing that's
[1:01:51] happening they they are concerned about
[1:01:54] their life
[1:01:57] they are
[1:01:58] environment which is good you must know
[1:02:02] what's going on in in the
[1:02:04] world but there are a physical part of
[1:02:09] life there are spiritual part of
[1:02:13] life now the spiritual part is not seen
[1:02:18] by a naked
[1:02:20] eye now most people are ignorant of the
[1:02:24] spiritual part
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:27] now let me just now now educate you
[1:02:32] spiritually we are living on this
[1:02:35] planet they've got two forces
[1:02:38] here there's one force that will drag
[1:02:41] you to eternal
[1:02:43] life to the kingdom of God there's
[1:02:47] another force that will drag you to
[1:02:50] another
[1:02:51] kingdom King the kingdom of this
[1:02:54] world we've got two uh
[1:02:58] forces now in teing them we say another
[1:03:02] force is draging you to its own
[1:03:06] kingdom now there are people then who
[1:03:09] are ignorant who are not aware of that
[1:03:13] who doesn't even care they don't even
[1:03:15] pray they didn't even try to contact God
[1:03:19] they just wake up and go to work and
[1:03:23] come back wake up go to school
[1:03:26] come back they don't have any
[1:03:29] contact with the
[1:03:31] spirit there is the spirit of God that
[1:03:35] really contacts you that you need to
[1:03:38] communicate with on daily basis on
[1:03:42] hourly basis on every minute a spirit
[1:03:46] that you need to contact
[1:03:48] you because one day look when God
[1:03:52] created you he God has created You Out
[1:03:57] of the Dust of the earth he formed Men
[1:04:00] Out of the Dust of
[1:04:02] the the body itself it is
[1:04:06] useless there's nothing worth of this
[1:04:11] body when when when when you are dead
[1:04:14] they cannot sell you and say this you
[1:04:17] worth nothing your body worth
[1:04:20] nothing are we together if you've got
[1:04:23] the gold teeth take it out because at
[1:04:27] least it worth something your
[1:04:30] ring they will take it out it worth
[1:04:34] something but your body worth
[1:04:38] nothing are you together now what
[1:04:42] happens what makes the body worth
[1:04:45] something is the spirit that God
[1:04:50] breathe into that body God breathe a
[1:04:54] spirit into that
[1:04:57] and then that spirit is to keep that
[1:05:01] body alive when that Spirit goes out of
[1:05:05] that body the body there's nothing that
[1:05:08] you can do you can clap it and do
[1:05:11] whatever you
[1:05:12] want it won't rise up it needs a spirit
[1:05:17] that will raise it
[1:05:19] up are we together now what happens now
[1:05:23] that spirit is out of the body
[1:05:26] now that spirit is to keep the body
[1:05:30] alive and then when God want to speak to
[1:05:35] that individual he gives it the soul and
[1:05:39] the Soul gave you a
[1:05:41] nature are you together when you were
[1:05:45] born you were born with your family
[1:05:50] nature but now your family
[1:05:53] nature is not of God it's of your
[1:05:57] family are we together now in your
[1:06:01] family you will say in our family we
[1:06:05] don't allow this and this and this that
[1:06:07] is your family but now one day you will
[1:06:11] have to change your
[1:06:14] nature your nature now become
[1:06:17] Divine and then when it's divine your
[1:06:21] nature changes now it's no more your
[1:06:24] family nature you will have two
[1:06:27] Natures now Paul says I have two of them
[1:06:32] my physical nature draws me to my
[1:06:36] family but now the supernatural one
[1:06:40] which is deep within me is calling me
[1:06:43] towards
[1:06:44] called so now you have to balance the
[1:06:47] two
[1:06:48] Natures while I am a being belonging
[1:06:53] toana yet Within Me
[1:06:56] there is a soul which belongs to
[1:06:59] God are we together when the word comes
[1:07:02] it goes to my soul when my father comes
[1:07:06] comes to my human
[1:07:08] nature he speak me as my father in human
[1:07:14] nature but God comes also as a father
[1:07:20] now I'll be having two fathers my
[1:07:23] biological father when he speaks to me
[1:07:26] he speak to me as my biological
[1:07:29] father my Supernatural Father which is
[1:07:32] my Divine father he comes to me and
[1:07:36] speak me as my Divine
[1:07:38] father I have to balance
[1:07:41] my this is
[1:07:44] my my my my biological father and this
[1:07:48] is my spiritual
[1:07:50] father but who is bigger higher stronger
[1:07:56] the two father the two fathers where
[1:07:59] does my father come
[1:08:00] from he was formed by God where does my
[1:08:05] spiritual father come from which is God
[1:08:08] himself No Beginning No End no beginning
[1:08:12] of Life no ending of life which is the
[1:08:16] better father not that your biologic is
[1:08:20] not
[1:08:21] good he raised you up good taking you to
[1:08:26] school he's done everything wonderful
[1:08:29] father what you have done is good we
[1:08:32] still respect you but there is no one
[1:08:36] but there's one that has got no
[1:08:38] beginning there no end so rather I will
[1:08:43] go for this one because I don't want to
[1:08:46] end because I don't have a beginning to
[1:08:50] now the inner man which is my soul has
[1:08:54] got no beginning has got no end because
[1:08:58] it's that father are you are we
[1:09:02] together who okay Mary gave
[1:09:07] birth to their son
[1:09:10] Jesus whose father was
[1:09:15] Jesus because the angel
[1:09:17] came and said thou shall conceive
[1:09:21] conceive
[1:09:22] what and bear a son
[1:09:26] the Bible says
[1:09:28] Joseph wanted to get rid of
[1:09:34] Mary right am
[1:09:36] because she has
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:40] conceived now Mary meet
[1:09:45] Gabriel then Gabriel said you you will
[1:09:48] conceive and then Mary says I don't have
[1:09:52] any
[1:09:53] man and the Gabriel
[1:09:56] says the spirit of the Lord will
[1:09:59] overshadow
[1:10:02] you right amen the spirit will
[1:10:06] overshadow you and you will bear a son
[1:10:10] and then what did Mary say Mary said Let
[1:10:14] It Be according to your
[1:10:17] word just those words that's the one
[1:10:21] that conceived him and conceived
[1:10:24] her she conceived of the
[1:10:28] word are we together and then she bear a
[1:10:32] child of
[1:10:34] the how can you conceived of a
[1:10:38] we now
[1:10:41] isia conceived of the
[1:10:43] word the word was Spen was spoken to
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:49] him there is God that has created you or
[1:10:54] that is God that has processed you now
[1:10:57] you must repent and recognize that God
[1:11:02] just by those words then you conceive
[1:11:06] you conceive the word of
[1:11:08] God now when we say we are
[1:11:11] waiting for the coming of the
[1:11:14] Lord coming for what what is he going to
[1:11:17] do to come and take his word that is in
[1:11:23] you are we together
[1:11:25] his word is in you you have conceived
[1:11:28] the word and that word has formed a
[1:11:32] person and that person is what you were
[1:11:36] before you become what you
[1:11:39] are before you
[1:11:41] becomes you the
[1:11:44] way are we together now God follows it
[1:11:48] and planted it in yourself in your heart
[1:11:53] and that germinate
[1:11:55] formed a man and that man is not the man
[1:11:59] of the
[1:11:59] world that is why he says those that you
[1:12:03] have given me they were
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:08] yours now he's coming to make them
[1:12:12] recognize that they are not of the
[1:12:18] world together so now I said uh uh John
[1:12:23] 6 did we read it
[1:12:25] okay fine let's read it it's 10 to now
[1:12:28] uh I think we are moving out
[1:12:31] here 8:00 now if you can read John
[1:12:37] 6 uh my brother let's read verse
[1:12:41] 39 John chapter
[1:12:44] 6:39 okay let's let's start
[1:12:48] from verse 36 up to
[1:12:53] 39 John chapter 6
[1:12:56] verse 36
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:38] now listen what what he says
[1:13:40] here but I say unto you you you also
[1:13:44] have seen me and believe
[1:13:48] not it's like people that hear the
[1:13:52] word and believe it not
[1:13:55] to the
[1:13:56] Jews he came as
[1:13:59] Jesus they believed him not now what did
[1:14:02] he do he jumped over
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:09] to when he came the first time it was
[1:14:12] not for
[1:14:13] theas the P the
[1:14:16] shans the Germans
[1:14:18] we he was not for the Gentiles only to
[1:14:22] the Jews when he sent his disciples
[1:14:26] will always says go to the house of
[1:14:30] Israel they rejected him then from there
[1:14:34] on crossed over to
[1:14:39] the and the Gentiles let me put it that
[1:14:42] way right but I say unto you that you
[1:14:45] also have seen me and believe
[1:14:49] not now to us he came as the we
[1:14:55] can I repeat
[1:14:57] that the word that is written in this
[1:15:00] Bible he came through it you read this
[1:15:04] word it it becomes very difficult for
[1:15:07] you to understand it but you go to the
[1:15:11] university you get a very big book
[1:15:14] written by
[1:15:15] fer you will read it and
[1:15:20] even
[1:15:22] graduate graduate but when you read this
[1:15:25] one you won't understand it you need a
[1:15:30] spirit that will guide you to
[1:15:33] understand that's where the mystery is
[1:15:37] because it's written by God
[1:15:39] himself through the
[1:15:41] inspiration now when you read it you
[1:15:44] read you need that
[1:15:47] inspiration that's why now then he
[1:15:49] continues and say all that the father
[1:15:53] have given me verse 37
[1:15:56] shall come to
[1:15:59] me and him that cometh to
[1:16:02] me I will know
[1:16:07] CH so you go you you you become a
[1:16:10] believer of the word of
[1:16:12] God not because you want
[1:16:15] to no it's something that is in
[1:16:21] you otherwise if one can change change
[1:16:25] the hearts of
[1:16:26] people I can change you
[1:16:28] all if I had that power but it's God do
[1:16:34] that are we together even now I'm I'm
[1:16:38] preaching here but there are those that
[1:16:40] can hear me there are those that cannot
[1:16:43] hear me there are those that hear this
[1:16:46] man is saying the word of
[1:16:49] God there are those that say no
[1:16:53] we it's because
[1:16:55] come from different
[1:16:58] direction now very that's why in verse
[1:17:01] 37 says that the father given
[1:17:05] me shall shall come to me all that the
[1:17:12] father has given him shall come to
[1:17:16] me and him that cometh to
[1:17:21] me I will know why is cast out
[1:17:26] you hear what he says now verse 38 ver
[1:17:29] 38 for I came down from
[1:17:35] heaven not to do my own
[1:17:38] will but the will of him that sent
[1:17:43] me you hear what he says there's
[1:17:46] somebody that has sent
[1:17:48] him make me aware when the H has
[1:17:52] arrived is it okay
[1:17:56] oh sorry sorry sorry okay let me just
[1:17:59] wind
[1:18:00] up I've got about four minutes now he
[1:18:03] says for I come down from
[1:18:06] heaven not to do my own
[1:18:09] will the will of him that sent me the
[1:18:13] last verse says and this is the Father's
[1:18:18] will which yeah he has sent me that all
[1:18:23] which he had given me I should lose
[1:18:29] nothing but should raise it
[1:18:31] up again at the last
[1:18:35] day so now what is
[1:18:38] happening is that now when somebody
[1:18:43] dies the spirit comes
[1:18:47] out goes back where it come
[1:18:50] from the
[1:18:52] soul go and wait
[1:18:55] somewhere else the body goes to the
[1:18:59] Grave so is the
[1:19:02] separation everything takes this
[1:19:05] direction the day you depart
[1:19:08] also your spirit will be
[1:19:11] taken and your soul will be taken out
[1:19:14] your body will buried now it depends on
[1:19:17] where does your spirit
[1:19:20] go you don't serve God it can't go to
[1:19:24] God
[1:19:25] and if your your
[1:19:27] soul was not occupied by the word of
[1:19:31] God it can go to God that's why now we
[1:19:35] have that's what we have what we call
[1:19:39] hell we we've got what we've got
[1:19:42] heaven got another dimension where the
[1:19:45] soul
[1:19:47] weighs we have this body here on
[1:19:51] Earth but when we die we wear another
[1:19:53] body
[1:19:55] but when we go to heaven it's another
[1:19:57] body we've got this terrestial
[1:20:00] body we've got when we come out of this
[1:20:04] one we wear a Celestial body and when we
[1:20:08] go to heaven we wear a
[1:20:16] glorified that is not just a
[1:20:19] saying thank you may the Lord bless you
[1:20:21] all may the family be comforted
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:27] that now he will rise
[1:20:29] another the spirit of him is in the
[1:20:34] hands of God but the soul is in the
[1:20:38] sixth
[1:20:39] Dimension and the body we are going to
[1:20:41] take it to the
[1:20:42] Grave one day that spirit will move from
[1:20:47] Heaven Come and collect the
[1:20:51] soul and come into this body he will
[1:20:57] res so that is your consolation sister
