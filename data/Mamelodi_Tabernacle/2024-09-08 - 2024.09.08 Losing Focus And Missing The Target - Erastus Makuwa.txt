Description:
Title: Losing the focus and missing the target
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 08 September 2024

The Pastor read the following scriptures: 

Mathew 14:22-331  | 1 Corinthians 13:10-11 | 
2 Corinthians 5:7  | 2 Timothy 4:9, 22  | 
Philemon 1:24  | John 5:19  | Gala1:24 | Mark 10:17-22  | Luke 12: 16:21

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about Losing the focus and missing the target. 

Things that can cause a person to lose focus are Lust of Flesh, Lust of the eye, Pride of life. You must not look at the present stage, look at the end. You don’t have to look down, you must look at the Lord. Don’t try to do this and that, just give it to the Lord. Those who try to do things have failed, but those who have given it to the Lord have managed. 

In life we have people who impersonate others, they try to be believers when they are not believers, they look at the failures of others while they are the ones who fail. People try to do what they think is important but fail. 

Every word of God and every promise that He has made is true, and it is to everyone who will accept it. 

The gospel of healing is not to everyone. It is to all if they can believe it, but we know that not all can believe it. Devine healing is for people who can believe, but you cannot believe until there is something within you to make you believe. Devine healing is for the Bride. 

People don’t know what is important in Christianity, they think what they are trying to do is important and that is not correct. The word of God is the one that is important. The Word of God of your age is the one that is important. You need to believe the one He has sent, that is important. 

We are living in a time where the seed has been matured. 

People miss the mark because they want to do something and be seen and be praised not for God to be praised but them. 
We don’t walk by sight we walk by faith; sight is our problem. 

You are not healed by any person, but you are heale...

little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingom om of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them amen you may take your [Music] seats they brought them children unto him so that he can touch them they touch the want it was not the outdoor touch they wanted the inward they wanted the life of these children to be changed they know that if that man can touch them these children's lives will be changed to get the children to guide them they can try to guide them to protect the children they can try to protect them but the problem is the inside that is what they want him to touch because if he can touch them

they say unto let us go to the house I believe that is what you saying you are glad when they said to you let us go to the house because that is where we meet our blessings that is where we are going to get power during the week we're telling Satan you must know I'm going to church on Sunday you are going to be in trouble the chance you are taking now use it because on Sunday you are not going to go on like I'm going to tell [Music] God about what you are doing to me and he's not going to be happy about you do what you want to do now because chance is limited while standing on let's open the Book of Matthew chapter 14 as you know [Music] um uh I want to do what we call uh scriptural lecture it's not they preaching it's a scriptural lecture you see these people of the world they used to say they're going to have a lecture on now we going to have a lecture scriptural lecture then when we go back we'll be fortified because we behav that would be AC acquiring more AC let's read the uh Matthew 14 CH 22-33 Matthew 14: 22 to 20 to 33 to 33 22 to 33 or 32 to 33 and straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him said Lord if it be thou beat me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but now he saw the wind be stros he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt and when they were come into a ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou are the Son of God Amen let us pray our de father thank you for this privilege you have privileged me with humbly we are coming before thee with my brother here we have got voice The Voice we are given by you yes we have read the scripture here standing in front of your church CH standing in front of bride you are the only one who can talk to them use our voice to deliver your message to them heavenly father I pray humbly in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen while you are taking your seats our brother will also read the book of First Corinthians 13 13 10 to 11 10 11 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things God bless you amen my topic will be losing focus and missing the target brother Bram says in this book here he says tonight we are going to try to take the word of God by the power of the Holy Spirit to blow all the indifferences and DS away from us all those little light fluffy things that just doesn't have any foundation doesn't have any weight in our life we want to blow it all away so we can find this glorious vein that vein is Christ he says in this book Luke he says that is what the church should do that is what each member of the church should do would focus out of all doubts look only to the way it promised it God said so is good to be that way amen Focus to the weight what can cause one to lose focus I'm going to tell you if I can find what they want to find what cause somebody to lose focus brother says here in this book Seven Church ages seven Church ages he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne as I also overcame and am and am sat down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome that is normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for th it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus Christ over coming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matth chapter 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he came he overcame the personal Temptation Of Satan by the word by the word only each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden I've said what can cause one to lose focus and miss the target these are the following the lust of the flesh the lust of the AR the pride of life these three things are the things which can cause man to lose focus and miss the target I'm going to put some examples of people who lost focus and missed the T but let me and let me continue reading this Jesus overcome by the word he fell to personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the way are you together there is brother BR talks about a brother here he say Brother Boer this brother was talking about how he was involved in a certain competion it was a bicycle competition you know about that and when he was in that competition he he he said they were sure that they're going to win that competition there was a certain boy they thought he wouldn't be in a picture because he was too weak for that competition but H he said the the competition was to to ride on a plain wood at 2 me above above the Earth and they said he said they all tried to ride those bicyle on that dud he said there was one little boy there we never would fellowship with him he didn't look like he know too much so we thought we were just little better than than that he was you know every one of us fell off that board but him he said he wrote it right out to the end and got off and bowed and pick up the sh bicycle because the price was a bicycle price then this boy won that race and and he took the bicycle and R away he said we boys met him down at the corner and we said John we want to know how did you got it he said I I am not the wrer that you fell are but said I see where you made your mistake you were looking down like this trying to balance it and I said that made you nervous and you fell off he said when I got on there when they push me I just kept watching the end of the road I didn't look every side the last of the the last the last of the eye he overcome it he look straight at the end he said the that is how I manag to to to to pass is what the man of God say something yeah he says it doesn't matter how you could you could work or pray or whatever let me read something for you here but it must be C who is doing that thing he says yeah you say well brother BR brother I have thought I had to do this and I had to do that such a difference in it in what you have to do and what you want to do you are safe not because you have done one thing to do with it you are Sav because that God saved you before the foundation of the [Music] world you don't have to look down look forward to Christ don't try give it to God are you together with us don't try to do this and that but look took it unto the Lord those who try this and that they have failed but those who have given it unto the Lord they have Manish they have manag let me read something for you here the prophet says that is why some people can believe it some can't believe it some try to make believe it in ordinance of people PR line comes through they were all good people there some that try hard to believe [Music] it try to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others just by Grace is just given to them you see this boy he was not qualified he knew that he could not ride the Bic but he had Fai he looked forward he WR the B looking forward but there are others who tried hard you see in life we've got people who impersonate they impersonate others they try to be Believers while they are not they try to please other people but they they are not Christians the Bible says we have got some who are humble people who are placing their faith in God they say if God can help me I will do this and do this but there others who are looking at others they're looking at the failures of others but they are as [Music] themselves let me read something he says I would like to take little test out of here his unfailing Word of Promise our faith is based right here on the unfailing word of prise through ages has trusted in this in the promises of God now if you ever in your life ever come into the healing service and wanted to be pay all the attention to what you could I want you to do it now we want to see the Lord glorified I truly believe that every word of God every promise that he made true and it is to anybody who will accept and now there is some who try to accept it and cannot there is others who can accept and some get it without half try [Music] are you together now that we have to preach theel that healing is to all and we know it is not we see God said I hate isra said I hate and love Jacob you see Jacob didn't try anything but it was said what said I love but this one tried he was loved by his father but this one he was not loved but he had the promise that's why whatever he did was but this one even if he he he do something he missed the target he lose focus that's why when he was hungry he wanted to eat then Jacob said if you I can give you the food but if you can give you better said you don't know what is important even now people don't know what is important in Christianity think what they try to do is what is important it's not what you try to do but what is important is the word of God by the word of God for your age that is what is important they asked Jesus what can we do so that you can do your Works they wanted him to say do this do this do this but he said the works is when you believe the one he has [Music] sent are you together with me such a simple thing believe the word he had said and that is what people Miss to believe the one he had he had s all right let me go on here we preach healing as if healing is for all yet do we know it is not it is is to all if they can receive it but we know that they all cannot receive I just want to be as honest with you as I know how to do we have to preach salvation the same way that salvation is for all but we know that all cannot receive all men cannot see these things Jesus said blessed that your eyes that can see you are you understanding for there is many that cannot understand the Divine Healing is for people who believe but you cannot believe until something is within [Applause] you to make you to be Divine Healing is the fruit of the Bride we are living in another age we have passed other ages we are living in the bright age we are living where the seat has come to its maturity we are living in the SE age amen when that which is perfect come that which is in part will be done away with but people miss the mark there because they want to do something so that they can be seen so that they can be praised not God be praed them to be pred this way we are let me take a certain brother here because the Bible says second Corinthians 5 he said we don't walk by sight we walk by [Music] faith sight is our problem is our enemy feeling is our [Music] after you prayed for you wanted to feel that pain disappearing but if he doesn't disappear then you move from Brother you go to so that can pray for you also but brother pray for because you you still feeling that pain go to is not the one who you is not the one who is your faith in not in not but in God if you can recognize who are in this age when you feel pain you can go to your next sister I've P I pray but that's just pray for my sister if you recognize each other who you are you see there is something that you cannot do sorry there is something that you cannot do is to feed the sheep feeding the Sheep is for the pastor but to pray for one another you can do it yourself you have that power but you cannot feed feeding is for the pastor to feed the sheep is his [Applause] responsibility we don't walk by side we don't walk by feeling we walk by faith I'm going to you're going to see somebody here but let's just pass Peter we have seen Peter seen Jesus Jesus was walking on their problem they had a problem the problem was the ways the problem was the winds the ship was going this way that was the problem when they were in that Pro they see their master moving working on their problem when you are in those problem you can see Jesus moving on those problem of [Applause] your let me read something for you God willing I want to read here in this book no sometimes we have more troubles when we come Christians than when we did when we were Sinners it is written many many is the Affliction of theous the if you are theous you have many [Applause] affli if if you don't have many afflictions then because the Bible is the seed and the Bible is talking about me and you and we look this our mirror we look ourselves when the preachers are preaching we look ourselves in whether it is me whether I am there or not if you don't find yourself there check again Satan be your eyes many are Affliction of the righteous but the god delivered him from them all when Satan comes like a FL raises the standard he likes to do that he put you in that so that he can rise the stand so that he can be praised [Applause] God deliver him from all promise many afflictions strange feelings strange things that would be beyond our understanding but is always done for our good we just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be Faith to us amen if if I can understand he this then I won't have faith amen I must not understand so that I can have faith in God Amen but we do it we have it we believe by faith his word that is going to work some good things for us we could grasp that today on this morning on in this morning we would grasp that all our troubles and there is none of of us immune from them if we could realize those things are for our good it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials are brought upon us are more precious than gold itself it is God giving us this trial we become is God who gives us this trial after become his prop after our confession after our baptism after promised to walk in his life every trial that comes upon to perfect us his glory he bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us before before the trial come remember in all these things Satan tries to make us nervous when Peter was looking at Jesus they were a frighten they thought he was a ghost He said don't don't don't be afraid he I and Peter said can I come to you moving on the water Jesus said come Jesus said come that is come you see sometimes when we meet some problems we even forget what God has said about us then when we forget Satan gives us his more more things and Peter got out of the sheep looking at Jesus moving on the water had the Roaring of the Waves how violent those waves were because of hearing he tend to look at the wus when he lose that Focus he [Applause] s when he move out of the shiping those waves were there they were violent Jesus knew and seen them but he said come come Jesus walking and first Peter walked but he lose focus Miss Target Target was to arrive where Jesus was our Target is to be [Music] like Hallelujah and he is the word and if he's the we we must be the we we have got ingredients and we have got cells this way iSell upon if we if we take it I was telling the children of God I said another Pastor one day start to preach he wanted to preach about the Lord the first Sunday preach about that suay and finish the next preach about that suay the Second Sunday he preach about say finish the fourth one he preach about the Lord Lord then the F he came to the church church do you do you know what you have in you they said no he said you have thus sayith the Lord in you if you were there when he preach about but when you preach about you were not there you see now you don't have the those who C building up to the Lord it is important to attend the church to hear the word of God because there are they building you to something if you miss [Music] one you give Satan chance to defeat you remember all these things Satan tries to make us nervous upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen why couldn't I have been like this in those crucial hours that press us to those second s was in the Bible remember no matter how great the distress is Satan cannot take your life until God has said until God has finished with you if God is still working with you Satan will do nothing there is nothing there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there is no evil can come unless God permits it it is for your good is working amen you see God always praise you before Satan Satan have you seen my son you seen my daughter [Applause] there and Satan will say no he is happy just distur see how we will refuse you a little and Satan will come around and if you lose focus then you miss the target Peter Peter because of the last of the eye he should have looked straight to Jesus to his Target he wouldn't have fallen the wind was violent when he went out of the ship but when he had and tend to look saw them he lose focus because of fear Jesus was there for him he was fortunate after missing the target Jesus was there read this scripture for me my brother second Timothy 49-22 second Timothy 4:9 to 22 you know that scripture I just want to make a revision [Music] second Timothy Chapter 4: 9-22 2 Timothy 4: 9-22 do thy deligance to come shortly into me unto me for demons have forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica to galatia timotheus unto Dalia only Luke is with me take Mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry and teus have I sent to Ephesus the cloak that I left at Tross with gapas when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the patment Alexander the co the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord will the word the Lord reward him according to his works of whom be thou where also for he hath greatly with stod our wordss at my first answer no men stood with me but all men forsook me I pray God that it may may not be laid to their Church let's just stop there a little we shall go back here I want to take this character this man must deas who is this Demas now he was from a rich family he was also wealthy he was brought into the gospel Ministry by Paul he became fellow he became Paul's fellow worker in the gospel Ministry and together with others Luke Mark and others even the book even the book of Colossians chapter 4:14 when Paul was in prison he spoke about de because he was with Paul then he was he Paul said he was a preacher and said he was a preacher but later he marked by his decep of Paul later he was marked by his de of Paul that is what the Bible says here why did this man leave listen to what he was thinking he knew Paul as a mighty man of God who could cast all evil spirits who could heal all diseases who could raise the Dead who could Smite people blind if they stood against his way now there is a man here Alexander alexand the copper Smith who is torturing Paul Paul doing nothing about you he thought Paul was washed up here is his friend friend of Paul theopus he is sick Paul cannot him but he healed many people but here is his friend he's sick Paul is just there he said drink a little wi that is what was wondering what was was amused what Isen with himself Paul he was sick he was always looking with a doctor next to him the doctor was Luke if you read where Paul was Luke was there he was he was he was always working with Luke Luke The Physician the Bible says Luke was a physician [Music] he lost focus of the word of Jesus [Music] Christ he lost the focus he missed the mark that is what happened here are you together with me brothers and sisters now Damas didn't smile he said why didn't he SM SM this man blind did SM Alexander blind he wanted to didn't Jesus say I do nothing till father shows me first if you can see a person say I he that one I heal this one that one was blind I him that one was a that is not [Music] God you cannot use God God will use you not youing him why that makes that that that that thing that must miss that thing he thought Paul could do anything he didn't know that it was God working through Jesus said I do nothing if I don't see my father Haven I told you years ago with my own mother was L dying and would say Bill what is My outcome I couldn't say nothing till God said so [Music] F that is just what happened man can't men can't man is a failure to begin with he's only an agent to which God works through God works his own will but when you see this super duper people that is always this and having this and that and the other you better stay away from it Jesus himself didn't do that he said I only work the father Works he shows me what to do and then I go do it I can't do other anything otherwise than that they must lose focus there he didn't look at the he missed what other people seen in Paul let me say this all these things brings back his love of materialism if you leave something bothering you which is against the words it will bring back your are old nature you see when you repent when you leave things here Satan pick them up and follows you with them when you stop he gives you back he don't leave he will follow with your if you are drun he will come back with your be that's why all these things which I read there while he was wondering why why why Paul didn't do this why didn't he do this why didn't he do this all those things brought back his laugh of mat Paul said he left me because of his love of this present world of men he wanted people to say hello Dr de how Dr [Music] deas he want to be to be [Music] praised he wanted to be somebody it is evident that Dem thought that what Satan has to offer him in this life is better than what God has to offer him in the next life he missed the target he missed what other people seen in Paul if we read the book of Galatians chapter one chapter verse 24 vers 24 he says people praised God in me people saw God in Paul and they praised God even if they were sick even Paul was sick but they pred God in Paul they didn't worry about the sickness [Applause] of they've seen God in this man of God Amen you cannot R it from them it is revealed to them but this one missed the focus and missed the Target and went back to the world [Applause] miss the target God cannot word without man he always had a man that is what people Miss they missed it from all there you make yourself better than others that is what G said g that is what said but God was using [Music] Moses what but that was woring Moses not God God Wasing that is what people miss and when you miss that then you miss that Target then you [Music] fall there is another young man read Mark chapter 10 my brother this is the spiritual lecture trying to blow away this fluffy things [Music] Mark 10 ver 17 ver 17 to 22 ver 172 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defro not honor thy father and mother and he said and he answered and said unto him master all this have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou laest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou sh have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was said at that saying and went away griefed for he had great possessions thank you very much I want to say to John the Baptist prepare your people for baptism let's go on a little um this this let's follow this man how this man was who was he he was also rich young man like Demus he was born and grew in a good and very home he was taught the law and kept it reverently he kept the law from his youth that is what that how he answered Jesus Jesus said you know the law he said no I kep from my youth he he was not telling Jesus a lie he was telling him the truth he kept the law but down in him there was something that belonged something more he was looking for something more then he wanted that then he went to the right person but something caused him to lose focus when he was gone forth into the way they came one running you see his approach he had a good approach because he was being grown religious he had respect you see his approach to Jesus the Bible says there running a rich man a richer man running coming to an ordinary man kneeling down a rich man kneeling down to an ordinary man he respect he KNE to him ask good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life Jesus said unto him why call th me good there is none good but the one that is good is God he had a good approach I dignified approach good Master what can I do that I may inherit he wanted something good something perfect something Beyond beyond anything he wanted that and he has he had come to the right place he had come to eternal life said oh the Bible says Jesus beholding him L him and he answered unto him Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lik way sever thou has give to the poor thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and take up that cross and follow me H what an answer Jesus answer made him to go away he was griefed why because he had many possession he thought Jesus would say if you can just give always 10% always always you have that would have said one is I can give you but he said go and say so that you are whole thing you must love God with all your heart [Music] spirit and soul love God don't let anything to stand between you because he said where your treasure is your heart will be there he said that that's why he said take away your treasure and you will have eternal life that gri that de man because he had more possession he Luke just read Luke then we are going to close Luke chapter 8 verse 7 Luke 8 ver 7 and read 14 and 14 God willing we shall come
