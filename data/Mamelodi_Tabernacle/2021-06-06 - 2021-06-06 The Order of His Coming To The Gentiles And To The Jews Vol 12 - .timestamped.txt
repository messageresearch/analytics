[13:45] their way.
[13:48] They [music] have lost [singing]
[13:52] their vision [music]
[13:56] of peace.
[14:02] Shall we bow our heads?
[14:05] Indeed, oh Lord,
[14:08] we don't have to lose the vision
[14:12] because father the vision is coming from
[14:15] thee.
[14:18] Heavenly Lord, even in this time where
[14:20] we are, Father,
[14:23] you still have your own vision, Lord.
[14:27] And the vision that is with us today,
[14:29] Father,
[14:31] is the vision, oh Lord,
[14:34] for your order of your coming.
[14:37] And Father, we thank you, Lord, that
[14:40] as the pastor Father is just taking us
[14:42] through, Lord, we thank you, Father,
[14:46] that indeed that is your vision. Father,
[14:50] this morning, Lord, we have came from
[14:52] different places.
[14:55] Others, my father, they are training in
[14:57] different places in some other
[14:59] countries.
[15:00] Father, we pray that Lord all of us
[15:03] we've got one mind, the mind of Christ
[15:06] Jesus and the vision of the Lord.
[15:09] Father, we glorify your holy name as we
[15:11] give you the honor this morning. We
[15:14] thank you father that those who are sick
[15:16] they are healed even this morning as we
[15:18] sing because father we only know that my
[15:22] father in heaven is silent and father
[15:26] you are only receiving lord the praise
[15:28] and worship father from your god
[15:32] &gt;&gt; and the father we like to thank you lord
[15:34] that when we give the glory and honor
[15:37] you said father in the last day those
[15:39] who are going to worship you they have
[15:41] to worship the father in truth and in
[15:44] spirit. And that is what we are doing
[15:47] this morning. Oh Lord, as we give you
[15:49] the glory, as we honor thee, Father,
[15:50] this [music] is the service. As my
[15:53] father, we pray for our brothers leading
[15:55] us with the songs and also Father, we
[15:58] pray for the pastor who is coming. We
[15:59] pray for all the offerings and
[16:01] everything that is going to happen into
[16:04] this place. Father, we love to thank you
[16:06] that mommy Lord is not the least. Oh
[16:09] Lord, that in mommy lord we have
[16:11] received the message and father we thank
[16:13] you like the Bible says Lord Bethlehem
[16:17] you are not the least from all the
[16:19] princesses and the prince of Judah
[16:22] because out of you a ruler will be born.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; He will shepherd my people Israel.
[16:28] Hallelujah.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; And that is why even this morning father
[16:31] this is what we say that out of m Lord
[16:35] Lord people are blinded they don't know
[16:37] that the message [music] father it is in
[16:40] this place oh lord and father we thank
[16:42] you that those father whom lord their
[16:46] eyes are being open my father we are
[16:49] just going to hold on lord to what you
[16:51] are giving us this morning also as we
[16:54] give you the glor as we honor you my
[16:56] father we just want to stand against
[16:58] every principalities of darkness, Satan,
[17:01] Lord, in the name of Jesus this morning
[17:04] because we know that my father as we as
[17:07] the Lord is here and the devil is also
[17:10] planning to come and disturb my father.
[17:12] But we thank you Lord that it's not
[17:14] going to happen
[17:15] &gt;&gt; because my father we are coming from
[17:18] thee and we are going back from thee. We
[17:21] are the sons of the most high God. We
[17:23] are the daughters of the most high God.
[17:26] And no matter what the devil is trying
[17:28] to do, my father, he will never harm us
[17:31] because the Bible says you have given us
[17:33] the authority to stand, the authority to
[17:36] train on serpents and scorpions and over
[17:39] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[17:41] by any means shall hurt us. As we give
[17:44] you the glory, Father, as we continue
[17:45] with the with the service in Jesus
[17:48] mighty name. Amen.

[53:40] We also have now now this all this is
[53:44] rapturing faith.
[53:48] We we are going through the rapturing
[53:51] faith.
[53:54] You know I was just reading something
[53:55] but
[53:58] we will take it the next time. It says
[54:01] the Lord now is outside the church
[54:12] and
[54:13] in Malawi I took that part that part
[54:16] that the messenger left the church and
[54:21] went west what was it west what
[54:25] &gt;&gt; yes to connect with the angel's message
[54:35] We will come to to those things
[54:38] and show that he he is not in the
[54:41] church,
[54:43] he's outside the church.
[54:46] Now
[54:49] those who follow him
[54:52] will have to leave the church.
[54:57] Amen. And
[54:59] Follow him where he is
[55:03] &gt;&gt; because outside the church means the
[55:05] ministry has changed.
[55:10] Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; You remember how he fed the people
[55:15] with fish and bread.
[55:19] The Bible says after that
[55:23] he jumped into a ship
[55:25] to go across.
[55:29] And the Bible says John 6, you know the
[55:32] scripture.
[55:34] The next morning the people came to
[55:37] where he fed the thousands
[55:43] thinking that he is still there.
[55:48] Then the Bible says when they arrive he
[55:50] was not there.
[55:52] Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; They wondered at it because they thought
[55:57] that was the place of worship.
[56:01] Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; And then because he was still on his way
[56:04] to the cross.
[56:09] Then uh then they also took the ship to
[56:13] the other side.
[56:16] But when they arrived
[56:18] the message, church
[56:23] Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And so
[56:26] they wondered because they thought there
[56:29] is still bread and fish on the other
[56:32] side.
[56:34] But the there was still bread and bread,
[56:40] but it has changed to be his body.
[56:46] For he said to them, "Except you eat the
[56:50] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[56:52] blood, you have no life."
[56:58] You see, he changed from that bread and
[57:02] fish
[57:06] to his flesh and blood.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Now he was now on the other side.
[57:15] Now even this morning he is on the other
[57:18] side
[57:20] of the seven churches.
[57:22] The ministry has changed already.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; It's something else now. Amen. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And when the seals were open, he had the
[57:33] prophet had to go westward
[57:37] and the ministry changed.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Now here we are.

[58:02] book of life

[58:12] small and great stand before God, and
[58:15] the books were opened, and another book
[58:18] was opened, which is the book of life,
[58:22] and the dead were judged out of those
[58:24] things which were written in the books,
[58:28] according to their works. Now, here they
[58:30] were judged according to their works.
[58:36] Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Now the the the bride of Christ

[1:00:26] were in it. And death and hell delivered
[1:00:29] up the dead which were in them. And they
[1:00:33] were judged every man according to their
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; works.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Works.

[1:00:44] a hardworking man or woman, you are
[1:00:47] going to be judged.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; The bride is not a hardworking woman.
[1:00:57] She was predestinated.
[1:01:00] Amen.
[1:01:02] And whosoever was not found written in
[1:01:06] the book of life because those in the
[1:01:08] book of life will be judged.
[1:01:13] Some some will be found
[1:01:16] judged according to their works.
[1:01:20] Then some will receive white robes
[1:01:26] according to their works.
[1:01:29] I hope I hope you you have switched off
[1:01:32] your mentality.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Now and whosoever was not found written
[1:01:41] in the book of life was cast into the
[1:01:43] lake of fire straight away.
[1:01:48] This one is not even judged.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; He was judged already.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And straight away to the lake of fire.

[1:02:14] life, he is just cast straight away into

[1:02:28] lamb's book of life.
[1:02:34] Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; And now Revelation chapter 5.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Did we read chapter one? Chapter 5 verse
[1:02:44] one.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let's go back to
[1:02:47] this.
[1:02:51] Go
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; chapter 1 to it's lengthy bit to 9.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 verse 1-9.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:03:06] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:03:10] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:03:13] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:03:16] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[1:03:19] worthy to open the book, and to lose the
[1:03:23] seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor
[1:03:27] in earth, neither under the earth was
[1:03:31] able to open the book, neither to look
[1:03:34] thereon. And I wept much because no man
[1:03:38] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:03:41] book, neither to look thereon. And one
[1:03:45] of the elders saith unto me, weep not,
[1:03:48] behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:03:52] the root of David, has prevailed to open
[1:03:56] the book, and to lose the seven seals
[1:03:59] thereof. And I beheld and lo in the
[1:04:02] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:04:04] beast and in the midst of the elders
[1:04:08] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[1:04:11] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[1:04:15] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[1:04:18] the earth. And he came and took the book
[1:04:21] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:04:24] upon the throne. And when he had taken
[1:04:27] the book, the four beasts and four and
[1:04:30] 20 elders fell down before the lamb,
[1:04:34] having every one of them hops and golden
[1:04:37] vials full of orders, which are the
[1:04:40] prayers of the saints. And they sung a
[1:04:43] new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[1:04:47] take the book, and to open the seals
[1:04:49] thereof. For thou was slain, and has
[1:04:53] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:04:57] every kindred and tongues and people and
[1:05:00] nation.
[1:05:03] Brother,
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; this is
[1:05:11] it's not this one. It's this one. Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; We are starting there.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh
[1:05:21] All right. God bless you.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm looking at something. I I want
[1:05:28] us to first
[1:05:30] uh see actually
[1:05:34] what is this book of life or the lamb's
[1:05:37] book of life.
[1:05:45] That's why it is so much rejected by the
[1:05:48] people
[1:05:52] today. I I'm told they are just
[1:05:54] preaching the sixth seal.
[1:06:01] Amen.
[1:06:02] And I said we are going to take both the
[1:06:06] six and the seven
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; when we arrive there to help the people.
[1:06:16] Let me just say it straight. Cape Town.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; You follow us there.
[1:06:26] You can even start now. We'll find you
[1:06:28] there because we are going to look at
[1:06:30] the sixth and the seventh seal.
[1:06:36] Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:06:40] Because the six is the tribulation.
[1:06:44] But right now, let's look at this. And I
[1:06:47] saw in the right hand. Now mark this in
[1:06:51] the right.
[1:06:54] Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Because uh the right hand
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; now that's why we I find the bride of
[1:07:06] Christ
[1:07:09] the right hand
[1:07:12] when he died.
[1:07:14] The Bible says he ascended up
[1:07:18] and sat on there
[1:07:22] at the right hand of the of the majesty.
[1:07:27] There's something about this right hand,
[1:07:33] the right hand of the majesty.
[1:07:38] Okay. Amen.
[1:07:40] and uh not to say something of myself of
[1:07:43] course
[1:07:46] a brother
[1:07:47] there's many of but I I'll quote only
[1:07:50] one
[1:07:53] we were fishing together
[1:07:56] then he comes and says
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; my hand is not working
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it was right or
[1:08:07] left.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; So I said
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and then I said to him it will work.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If there's a witness here who is
[1:08:18] not selfish, he will say amen to daddy.
[1:08:21] Witness is the person who was there.
[1:08:26] Then I said okay let me take your hand.
[1:08:30] Amen. Amen. And after that
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; the hand went. Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I used my right hand.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:08:45] you always look at this right hand.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; was the right hand man.
[1:08:58] The prophet, my prophet tells me so
[1:09:02] and it is in the Bible. He was the right
[1:09:06] hand man.
[1:09:09] So he lost the post
[1:09:12] because being in that post
[1:09:16] he thought that he could do something
[1:09:21] saying
[1:09:24] I I can become a ruler.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can rule from above.
[1:09:34] And that's when that's what the mistake
[1:09:37] he made.
[1:09:40] Sin not mistake.
[1:09:42] Sin
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; is when you think that you know better
[1:09:47] than the pastor.
[1:09:51] Yeah. You think so.
[1:09:54] And because you didn't hear the prophet
[1:09:56] of God
[1:09:58] saying the pastor is the angel of the
[1:10:02] church.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; How can you know better than the angel
[1:10:06] of the church?
[1:10:10] That caused Satan to be cast down.
[1:10:18] Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't take the word of the
[1:10:21] Almighty God.
[1:10:24] thinking that he knew better.
[1:10:28] And the Bible says because of his
[1:10:31] beauty,
[1:10:33] his brightness, he
[1:10:36] sinned
[1:10:46] you. I can be educated.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean I know.
[1:10:53] Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I I know that if I know
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; that's when I know God.
[1:11:05] Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; The first wisdom is
[1:11:11] fear of God is the first wisdom.
[1:11:16] Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; The first one
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; then you have graduated.
[1:11:21] Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; All right. H one brother said to me,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; don't always tell us that you are a
[1:11:33] standard six. You are standard six.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I say if you want me to say I am
[1:11:43] what do you call it the highest? What is
[1:11:45] the highest standard?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Doctorate. Yeah, if you want me to say
[1:11:51] that, I can say whatever you want me to
[1:11:54] say.
[1:11:57] If you want to me to say I've got
[1:11:59] honors,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I will say it because we we as the
[1:12:04] children of God have got all
[1:12:09] right. Okay. Let let let us come here
[1:12:13] then.
[1:12:16] I saw in the right hand
[1:12:20] of him that sat on the throne.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; A book
[1:12:27] written within and without
[1:12:32] in which end.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Now from here let us go just straight
[1:12:38] down from the right from this throne to
[1:12:41] the throne down but on the right.
[1:12:50] keeping the right side.
[1:12:54] Then it goes again to say
[1:12:58] now I I think already you are with me
[1:13:02] what is the lamb's book of life.
[1:13:10] Okay. Sometimes
[1:13:12] are you with me there?
[1:13:15] Now the book in the hands of whom?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; The one who sitth on the throne.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, that is the lamb's book of life.
[1:13:24] That is his book
[1:13:28] because no no one could open that book
[1:13:33] or could read out of that book because
[1:13:36] it is the book of the lamb.
[1:13:41] Amen.
[1:13:43] I hope somebody
[1:13:46] will hear it. I mean, let me let me just
[1:13:49] find something here.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You know, when Christ is standing
[1:13:55] outside, it's difficult to understand
[1:13:57] him.
[1:14:01] That's why he's no longer in the church.
[1:14:05] Now a church goer
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; will never understand
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; because when they were when he he he was
[1:14:16] on the other side
[1:14:20] those who were still remaining on this
[1:14:23] side
[1:14:25] could not hear what he was saying on the
[1:14:27] other side.
[1:14:30] If you are in a church age,
[1:14:33] you will never hear him. When he is
[1:14:36] speaking and he's on the other side,
[1:14:42] we are going we following some things
[1:14:45] that that you will understand what I'm
[1:14:47] talking about. Okay, let us read. This
[1:14:50] is the Bible now.
[1:14:53] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:14:57] with a loud voice. Not just an angel, a
[1:15:00] strong one.
[1:15:02] It takes a strong angel here
[1:15:05] who is worthy to open the book
[1:15:10] and to lose the seals thereof.
[1:15:14] Amen. Now you see
[1:15:17] who who is worthy.
[1:15:21] That's why the people if I I I'm not
[1:15:24] with you I won't even understand what is
[1:15:26] the the seventh seal
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; because it was opened by the one who is
[1:15:36] worthy
[1:15:41] he shed his blood.
[1:15:44] So he he was found to be worthy
[1:15:48] because
[1:15:50] that is his book.
[1:15:53] Brethren, while I'm talking, let me find
[1:15:55] you a book here by grace
[1:16:00] and then we'll look into it.
[1:16:04] H I hope is this one here.
[1:16:08] I hope so.
[1:16:11] God bless you, brethren.
[1:16:14] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are just h feasting
[1:16:18] on the
[1:16:22] eagle manner.
[1:16:26] Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; If it's not this one, I will find a
[1:16:31] book.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; But
[1:16:37] I want to read something here.
[1:16:41] You know meanwhile while while I'm
[1:16:44] looking for it
[1:16:47] let me say to you
[1:16:49] this is the book which the prophet of
[1:16:52] God says
[1:16:54] the Lord Jesus
[1:16:57] has signed it
[1:17:05] is the book
[1:17:08] only a page let me see perhaps
[1:17:11] Maybe I'm looking for something I've got
[1:17:13] here.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, pardon with me a bit.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Where is my book? Where is my book?
[1:17:23] Okay, while while I'm looking for you,
[1:17:26] let me say to you,
[1:17:29] he says, "This is the only book
[1:17:34] that the Lord has put his signature on."
[1:17:39] Amen. He he he he speaks if I don't find
[1:17:42] it now we still going to read it
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; hates the book of Genesis
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and Revelation.
[1:17:56] Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Because they both expose him.
[1:18:02] Now he says that book is not for
[1:18:06] everybody.
[1:18:08] Don't worry, I'm still going to read it.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; It's not for everybody.
[1:18:14] It's a book specially
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; h for a certain class of people.
[1:18:24] It says, "So, okay, let me you will hear
[1:18:27] when I read it that it will exactly tell
[1:18:30] you what I'm saying to you."
[1:18:34] He says this is the only book
[1:18:39] the Lord has put his own signature.
[1:18:44] It comes with his signature
[1:18:47] and no man could read it
[1:18:51] because no man recognized the signature.
[1:18:56] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Now which seal
[1:19:00] it's so unfamiliar with the people.
[1:19:05] the servants because they say he said
[1:19:09] nothing.
[1:19:12] All right. Amen. Now we'll come to
[1:19:14] something
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; where there is nothing
[1:19:19] to the bride there is something.
[1:19:23] Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But to the public to just a man is
[1:19:28] nothing. But there is it is something.
[1:19:33] Because when you go to buy a house, they
[1:19:36] want both your signature and your wife's
[1:19:39] signature.
[1:19:42] Amen. Amen. Yet there's nothing to the
[1:19:44] other one because you are the owner and
[1:19:47] you are the one that is buying the
[1:19:49] house.
[1:19:53] Somebody else would know nothing about
[1:19:55] it.
[1:19:56] Only those
[1:19:59] with the those who have put their
[1:20:01] signature
[1:20:04] their name.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to read it. Don't worry.
[1:20:10] But let's let's continue here.
[1:20:14] He has put his signature on it.
[1:20:18] And it says
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; this book
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; will only will will
[1:20:26] be understood by a special class.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Wait until we read it.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe now you think it's me saying that.
[1:20:39] You'll see. You'll hear. Okay. Here we
[1:20:41] here we ask. And no man in heaven nor in
[1:20:45] earth, neither under the earth was able
[1:20:48] to open, let alone to read it to open
[1:20:52] the book. Amen.
[1:20:55] neither to look there on
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; it was silence
[1:21:04] where
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; and what about in earth?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Because it never said
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; here on earth but in heaven.
[1:21:23] And he says the angels
[1:21:27] did not understand
[1:21:30] because the mysteries are not to the for
[1:21:33] the angels. They are for men.
[1:21:39] Amen. When they are still hidden, they
[1:21:42] are gods.
[1:21:48] Men, they are revealed.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; If unrevealed, they belong to God.
[1:21:59] But God never said he will reveal them
[1:22:01] to the angels
[1:22:04] because the angels
[1:22:07] minister unto us.
[1:22:11] Amen.
[1:22:12] Did you know that Peter says, "Even the
[1:22:16] angels,
[1:22:18] they desired to see the things that we
[1:22:20] see."
[1:22:24] Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Even the angels desired.
[1:22:29] Okay. Amen.
[1:22:31] Are you listening friends? Now the we
[1:22:34] are sons
[1:22:38] and even the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; came and took the form of
[1:22:44] Abraham
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; not of angels.
[1:22:50] The Bible says so the form of the image
[1:22:54] the form of Abraham a man.
[1:23:00] Amen. We'll read it. That's right. So
[1:23:04] that's why he never said, "Let us make
[1:23:06] angels in our image."
[1:23:10] But he said, "Let us make men."
[1:23:15] Amen. And the Bible answer, "Who is
[1:23:18] men?"
[1:23:21] Amen.
[1:23:23] because he himself
[1:23:25] became man
[1:23:29] until when they looked at him, they saw
[1:23:31] men
[1:23:34] until they crucified him as a man.
[1:23:39] But on the third day when he rose again,
[1:23:43] that is not man.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; It's man when they crucified you.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But he was not man.
[1:23:53] when he rose again.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now you consider us of men.
[1:24:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But I I wonder,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; how are you going to consider us
[1:24:12] as the judges? As judges.
[1:24:16] Amen. When we come to the throne, God
[1:24:20] will still consider us as just men
[1:24:23] because we will be judges there.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And in heaven, we are like high priests.
[1:24:29] And the Bible says he has made us
[1:24:31] priests.
[1:24:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I wept. I wept. Verse four. Because no
[1:24:44] man was found worth it to open and to
[1:24:49] read the book, neither to look here on.
[1:24:53] I think you understand this book. You
[1:24:55] know this book.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; And one of the elders says
[1:25:03] unto me, weep not. Behold, the the lion
[1:25:08] of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[1:25:10] David, hath prevailed to open the book
[1:25:15] to lose the seven seals thereof. Because
[1:25:19] if you have not prevailed, you can't
[1:25:21] even read it.
[1:25:26] Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's for the overcomers.
[1:25:31] Amen.
[1:25:32] In the church ages,
[1:25:35] you find just the
[1:25:40] church members
[1:25:43] and what they call the overcomers.
[1:25:47] Amen. We will come to that.
[1:25:51] Now
[1:25:53] you you if you take the right hand side,
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; you are coming down the overcomers.
[1:26:03] You'll hear that book will talk about
[1:26:04] them.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Then we are going to read even out of
[1:26:08] the book of church ages
[1:26:12] overcomers.
[1:26:14] Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Because be before you can be found
[1:26:19] worthy,
[1:26:22] you must overcome.
[1:26:25] Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You overcome to possess.
[1:26:30] Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You overcome to hear to understand.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] after
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; overcoming
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; is then those those who overcame
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; received not ropes like those who were
[1:26:53] judged according to their works
[1:26:58] but they stand there as judges
[1:27:06] listen what it says
[1:27:09] the whole as you going downh
[1:27:15] the other one wept
[1:27:17] the all all of them looking for a worthy
[1:27:21] one
[1:27:23] the worthy one here is the book but who
[1:27:27] is worthy
[1:27:30] and they wanted to know what's in this
[1:27:33] book
[1:27:35] they know that they are named
[1:27:37] are in the book.
[1:27:40] Brother Brenham says John saw his name.
[1:27:46] When he saw his name
[1:27:48] beyond the kitten of time,
[1:27:51] then he said there is John.
[1:27:55] Amen. Amen. Amen. that was beyond the
[1:27:59] now those who can see their names
[1:28:03] in the lamb's book
[1:28:05] they know that there is my name
[1:28:10] and because his name is there
[1:28:14] he can read that book now
[1:28:17] and understand what is written in the
[1:28:19] book
[1:28:21] because his name is there
[1:28:25] all right amen
[1:28:27] Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Now, behold, they said, "Weep no, don't
[1:28:32] weep.
[1:28:35] One of the elders said unto me,
[1:28:38] weep not. Behold, the lamb of the tribe
[1:28:42] of Judah,
[1:28:44] the root of David,
[1:28:46] hath prevailed,
[1:28:49] and opened the book to lose their seven
[1:28:53] sins."
[1:28:56] In this book, it is the
[1:29:00] what? What of the sun?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; It is the rising of the sun.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; The sun. S O N.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It says
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; he is the seals.
[1:29:15] Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That were opened.
[1:29:19] Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Because he opened
[1:29:24] the seals. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And simply I can say
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; the prophet will come and read it. The
[1:29:32] prophet says
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; he opened the seals
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; and gave it to the seventh angel
[1:29:41] messenger.
[1:29:44] Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; For him
[1:29:48] it is in the book. You've got it.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; But wait until we read it.
[1:29:54] He tore off the seal
[1:29:58] and gave the book to the seventh angel
[1:30:02] messenger.
[1:30:05] Amen.
[1:30:10] Sometimes we put it so straight and say
[1:30:12] he gave the book to brother Brennham.
[1:30:18] Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:23] And it's hard to say amen to that.
[1:30:27] He came with the book. He gave it to
[1:30:30] brother Bren.
[1:30:32] Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's too simple for a person whose name
[1:30:37] is not there.
[1:30:40] When he gave it,
[1:30:42] he says he gave it to the seventh angel
[1:30:46] messenger
[1:30:48] for to reveal it to the church.
[1:30:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; If you are waiting for revelation,
[1:30:59] the revelation don't come flying and
[1:31:02] jump into you or fly into you.
[1:31:06] When Cenius
[1:31:08] was waiting for the answer from God,
[1:31:12] there came Peter
[1:31:15] from Job.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; That was the answer.
[1:31:20] Amen.
[1:31:22] Do you know that
[1:31:24] when the man when the chariot from
[1:31:27] Jerusalem
[1:31:29] was reading the book of Isaiah's
[1:31:33] and he could not understand it
[1:31:36] and until
[1:31:38] God sent out Philillip
[1:31:42] and when Philip arrived
[1:31:45] the man was on a chariot
[1:31:48] and Philip said can I help you sir?
[1:31:51] Yeah, I've got I I'm reading here. I'm
[1:31:53] struggling here.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; But there's no man.
[1:32:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; To interpret this to me.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So he was in need of a man.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; That is the word of God. But he needed a
[1:32:12] man.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with the people?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; He needed a man.
[1:32:20] to interpret to him.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't say angel.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:32:28] "There is no man to interpret to me."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Philip said, "Here I am."
[1:32:36] Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; It is from God. It must be interpreted
[1:32:39] by men.
[1:32:42] That's how God did it. And we do it
[1:32:46] always like that. It has to come from
[1:32:49] God
[1:32:51] then through a man
[1:32:54] to a man.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And when Philip then Philillip
[1:33:03] interpreted to him
[1:33:06] and his eyes opened and said
[1:33:10] what now? Philip said here is water.
[1:33:15] He baptized him and vanished out.
[1:33:20] Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; When there was no man worthy
[1:33:26] in the in the garden
[1:33:29] in Eden,
[1:33:31] the Bible says
[1:33:33] there was no man
[1:33:36] worthy there. There was no man to
[1:33:42] always man.
[1:33:45] Because man is God's
[1:33:48] partner.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; The other part of the contract is held
[1:33:54] by men.
[1:33:58] You are deceived to say
[1:34:04] you must find a manifer.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, you worship.
[1:34:11] He was reading. He was from Jerusalem.
[1:34:15] Jerusalem. After that revival,
[1:34:18] he needed a man.
[1:34:22] Amen. And brother Benham says
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; not an angel
[1:34:27] man.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He says because
[1:34:32] man
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; is a gene.
[1:34:36] Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't look for an angel.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Cornelius.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Cornelius.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; He needed
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; a man.
[1:34:51] Peter.
[1:34:53] When they approach God,
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; God said, "See Peter,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; let us do our rounds, our rounds."
[1:35:06] When Saul
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; was blinded
[1:35:12] by God
[1:35:15] on his way to arrest the Christians
[1:35:20] when he was now blind,
[1:35:24] he was sent to
[1:35:27] Anas.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Anas
[1:35:32] amen.
[1:35:37] or God.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Who is What is man?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I'll read to you the book of Hebrews.
[1:35:50] Ask a question. What is man?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Is a being that God will
[1:35:59] would consider so much
[1:36:04] until Even back there,
[1:36:08] he molded things
[1:36:10] and sent them to a man
[1:36:13] to Adam
[1:36:15] to see what Adam would say.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't when he sent like a lion to
[1:36:23] Adam,
[1:36:25] he never gossip in his ear and say this
[1:36:28] one is a lion.
[1:36:32] Amen.
[1:36:33] He waited for Adam. There it is.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; If Adam says lion,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; the Bible says God said amen.
[1:36:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That's why it says what is man
[1:36:49] to be considered by God so much.
[1:36:53] Amen. Hey,
[1:37:02] Jesus was just like that.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; He is a man. He eats, he sleeps, he gets
[1:37:05] tired.
[1:37:06] You could find him sleeping.
[1:37:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; At one time he was sleeping in a ship.
[1:37:16] Amen. Amen. Amen. And when the the
[1:37:19] contrary arrived,
[1:37:28] it's it's bad out there
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; and always
[1:37:33] he would wake up to say
[1:37:37] where is your faith?
[1:37:41] Because he could he considered men to be
[1:37:44] like him.
[1:37:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; So he never said, "Oh, sorry.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I just fell asleep."
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; To Peter, you know, many people thought
[1:38:04] that
[1:38:06] when Peter started to sank,
[1:38:11] the Lord would say,
[1:38:16] My son, my son is sinking.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; But he said
[1:38:19] and he said, "You of little faith
[1:38:23] because
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; he did not make men to be like that."
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He wanted Peter
[1:38:33] to be like him.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he say, "Oh, you of little
[1:38:40] faith.
[1:38:42] You are disappointing me
[1:38:45] because you were supposed to walk like
[1:38:46] me upon upon the water. Now you are
[1:38:51] crying out here
[1:38:54] and you are really belittling my
[1:38:56] ministry. Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen sister. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen sister.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Means
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] Yeah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's like that.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; There was a pastor I'm told
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; he was preaching to some people
[1:39:29] and then
[1:39:32] they were like just looking at him like
[1:39:34] this.
[1:39:36] The brother says and the pastor said,
[1:39:39] "Amen.
[1:39:41] Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen."
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. One sister
[1:39:45] there saying, "Amen."
[1:39:47] Then they saw him picking his bags and
[1:39:50] he went out.
[1:39:53] I'm not saying I'll do that.
[1:39:56] No. Whether you say amen or not, I could
[1:39:59] because I'm preaching to the bride of
[1:40:01] Christ.
[1:40:04] Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Not to everybody.
[1:40:09] That's why we spend sleepless nights
[1:40:11] because we are dealing with the bride of
[1:40:14] Christ.
[1:40:19] Amen. Amen. God has put it upon us.
[1:40:23] Be serious about this message
[1:40:26] and put everything aside
[1:40:30] because we are dealing with equality.
[1:40:33] equality. Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; So now it takes equality
[1:40:40] to deal with equality.
[1:40:44] Now for the bride of Christ, you don't
[1:40:47] just come and say
[1:40:51] no, you can't do that. When the bride of
[1:40:53] Christ, you've got to dig
[1:40:58] because these things are not from here.
[1:41:02] They are from before the foundation.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's why.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I beheld verse six.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Lo, in the midst of the throne, and of
[1:41:20] the four beasts, in the midst of the
[1:41:22] elders stood a lamp.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; You see where where where he was found.
[1:41:33] in the midst of the throne
[1:41:36] in the midst of the four beasts, in the
[1:41:39] midst of the elders
[1:41:42] stood on them
[1:41:46] as it had been slain,
[1:41:49] having seven horns.
[1:41:52] We'll talk about that. Seven eyes,
[1:41:55] which are seven spirits of God, sent
[1:41:58] forth into the earth. Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know which do you know these
[1:42:04] seven spirits?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You see where the spirits are from?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Uh Pastor Freddy,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Pastor Freddy
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; from Congo,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; he said to me
[1:42:27] uh that time he was at my house.
[1:42:31] He said
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; uh
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; uh you know Belgium.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Go Belgium. Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; He even mentioned Italy.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Where is where is Vatican? Where where
[1:42:50] is it situated?
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; In Italy.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said in Italy
[1:42:57] they want to you to visit
[1:43:01] and I will take you there.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; That is pastor Freddy.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Pastor Fred.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I'm saying pastor because the Bible says
[1:43:09] he's a pastor.
[1:43:13] And a prophet says he is a pastor.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, a young man came to
[1:43:22] me
[1:43:24] And he said, "Brother Brenham says,"
[1:43:31] he actually wanted the people to say,
[1:43:33] "Brother,"
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, that is brother, but I
[1:43:40] call him prophet."
[1:43:43] Am I wrong to do that? The Bible says he
[1:43:46] is a prophet
[1:43:48] and me, I call him prophet.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And then uh I said and the Bible says
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I shall give you
[1:44:02] pastors.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the Bible gave me a pastor.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; You know, but if me I say don't call me
[1:44:14] pastor,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; call me brother. It's me.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; It's not the Bible.
[1:44:21] The Bible says pastor
[1:44:24] says pastor,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; you know, church politics,
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; I hate them.
[1:44:35] You even change the Bible just for the
[1:44:37] sake of being different.
[1:44:42] Why you call this man pastor?
[1:44:45] They say,
[1:44:47] let them ask me. I'll say because the
[1:44:49] Bible says he is the pastor.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:58] I'm glad that you are this.
[1:45:02] There is let me speak to this elders
[1:45:03] here. Not preach to them but speak to
[1:45:06] them.
[1:45:08] There is this young sister.
[1:45:12] She came to me and said
[1:45:16] they say you
[1:45:18] She visited a certain church.
[1:45:21] They said, "You know that pastor of
[1:45:23] yours.
[1:45:25] He's not Israel. He's Jacob."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, a brother tells me that
[1:45:33] that sister says they told her like that
[1:45:37] in the in a they were in a car
[1:45:42] from that certain fellowship."
[1:45:45] I said,
[1:45:48] You you you showed your sister this.
[1:45:51] Are they aware of the two fingers?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Right. If this one says,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; who's that? The brother to
[1:46:10] or if this one say Jacob
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; and this one says
[1:46:20] Are you aware? Are we Hey, the church.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Are you aware of that?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; If you say
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; supplant
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Jacob,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; this finger says
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Now, let's finish it today. Then God,
[1:46:41] let's ask God, God, what do you say now
[1:46:43] here?
[1:46:46] The people say this one is a suppler is
[1:46:48] Jacob.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; God just
[1:46:57] put it for us.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And God said, "I love Jacob."
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say it? Say, "I love Jacob."
[1:47:11] I love Jacob.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You're afraid. Eldashu.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. The elders say, "I love Jacob."
[1:47:18] This is what God has said.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Before it was changed. And the angel
[1:47:30] said,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; The angel said,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; "What's your name?"
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Jacob.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Jacob." Now he said the
[1:47:43] angel said from today thou art thou
[1:47:47] shalt be called.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; So now because there is it is from what
[1:48:00] you are and to who you are.
[1:48:05] Amen.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I was a I'm a sinner but saved by grace.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Then I am a Christian.
[1:48:18] Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody can continue to call me sinner
[1:48:22] but God will continue to call me my son.
[1:48:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. This things man are just for the
[1:48:34] those with God's wisdom. They know how
[1:48:37] to answer things and they know who they
[1:48:39] are.
[1:48:44] I'll tell you that
[1:48:48] I will tell you that I have no problem.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; An angry sister I was in Bumanga
[1:48:54] said to me, I know why she was angry
[1:48:56] with me.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jacob.
[1:49:03] You know what? How I answered her?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I said, "Hello, my sister."
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And she said,
[1:49:13] "Jacob,
[1:49:15] how are you, Jacob?
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I'm fine, my sister. How are you? And
[1:49:20] how's the children?"
[1:49:28] She can't hurt me. How how she going to
[1:49:30] help you?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, how are you?
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I would have said,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; "God bless you. Ye shall know the truth
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; and the truth
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; shall set you free."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as I know Esau, I don't
[1:49:50] have a problem. And as long as I know
[1:49:52] what did God say to Jacob, no problem.
[1:50:00] All right. Now God says they are
[1:50:02] pastors.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; If you want to change it, you can change
[1:50:08] it.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he came and took the book
[1:50:12] verse seven
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; out of the which hand
[1:50:19] right hand.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Of him that sat upon the throne.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] You know, it reminds me of Job.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; "I go
[1:50:35] left.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I can perceive him."
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; But he says left
[1:50:46] he workth
[1:50:48] on the left
[1:50:51] and he hides himself
[1:50:54] on the right hand.
[1:50:57] You see,
[1:50:59] so
[1:51:01] he is right in the
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; That's why now his people are the right
[1:51:08] hand people.
[1:51:11] Amen. That's why
[1:51:15] that's why to the world the Bible says
[1:51:18] and the world don't know them.
[1:51:22] Amen. because they are not of the world.
[1:51:27] The world loves its own.
[1:51:33] Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; I will read to you next John 17.
[1:51:38] The world don't love them
[1:51:42] when Jesus was praying.
[1:51:45] I am not of the world
[1:51:48] and they are not of the world.
[1:51:51] The world don't love them
[1:51:54] and that's why the world don't love me.
[1:51:58] The world is a system.
[1:52:02] The people,
[1:52:05] the systematic people,
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; they don't love God
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; because they say
[1:52:16] like this one who said,
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; you know, this church is a good church.
[1:52:21] I love it.
[1:52:23] But hey, the lawsman,
[1:52:26] don't do this. Don't eat this. Don't
[1:52:28] touch. Don't put on this.
[1:52:33] You mustn't cut like
[1:52:44] what is life.
[1:52:53] That's why
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; that's why a
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; won't mind saving worshiing with us
[1:53:07] because he doesn't need to make funny
[1:53:09] haircuts.
[1:53:11] It comes just like that.
[1:53:13] It comes to the service just like that.
[1:53:22] A person got funny hairstyles because
[1:53:25] there are these there's a new one these
[1:53:27] days
[1:53:34] another bed with but that bed God made
[1:53:37] it like that.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes with that hairstyle
[1:53:44] originally from God.
[1:53:48] this earth.
[1:53:55] I don't know why. Why can't you be human
[1:53:58] beings?
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; When I come from God,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; when he says you are
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; you are in Africa,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; go to Africa
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; and I say yes Lord
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; and I came to mommy. Africa
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; and I came to Africa.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; you are a Chinese.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Go to China.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; China.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; When he gets to China, he doesn't want
[1:54:31] to become an African.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; It's God's given nationality.
[1:54:37] Why don't we thank God for who we are?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; And for what he has made us to be. I am
[1:54:44] not ashamed to be an African.
[1:54:51] I always thank God
[1:54:54] for being an African.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; A white man is my brother.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Yellow man is my brother.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's God's variety.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; God wants us to be like flowers.
[1:55:13] One
[1:55:15] of different colors.
[1:55:18] That's why to me a white man is my
[1:55:21] brother.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; A Chinese is my brother.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hatred comes from Satan.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want it at all.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to walk with me,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; you must have hatred. Then I won't walk
[1:55:43] anymore with you.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; And hey. Yeah.
[1:55:48] Listen, we are now on the throne.
[1:55:54] The throne does not want hatred. You
[1:55:56] can't bring hatred to the throne. Amen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And he came and took the book.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Out of the right hand
[1:56:08] of him that sat upon the throne.
[1:56:15] We are on the throne,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; but we are on the right hand side
[1:56:22] now. And then you'll see when we are
[1:56:25] standing before that throne.
[1:56:29] The bride will say that is the language
[1:56:34] when they are standing before the throne
[1:56:39] because you are going to realize that
[1:56:42] you'll find Christ and the wife
[1:56:47] occupying the throne
[1:56:50] to hand over to hand judgment
[1:56:54] to hand out judgment.
[1:56:57] And the prophet told us even last week,
[1:57:02] those who will judge you
[1:57:04] are those who have preached to you.
[1:57:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? Amen.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; So now the very people that are
[1:57:16] preaching to you are going to judge you.
[1:57:20] Amen.
[1:57:27] But don't worry. Don't worry.
[1:57:30] The best judge
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; that day will be the man who has
[1:57:37] preached to you.
[1:57:41] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:45] Is that so, sister?
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking about the lamb's book
[1:57:52] of life.
[1:57:55] Now we we are coming as we are coming
[1:57:56] down to the throne
[1:57:59] because those in the lamb's book of life
[1:58:03] they are judges.
[1:58:06] Amen. Amen. Because that is his book.
[1:58:11] He had this book in his hand.
[1:58:15] Amen. And that's why we are the angel
[1:58:22] of the Lord
[1:58:25] was on the that angel on the right hand
[1:58:27] side. We will still read that.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Even the angel was on the right hand
[1:58:33] side.
[1:58:37] Did you hear that?
[1:58:39] Amen.
[1:58:41] And the seventh angel messenger
[1:58:45] actually Satan was Lucifer was the
[1:58:49] right-hand man.
[1:58:53] But when he lost the the the the post,
[1:58:58] he envied Adam
[1:59:02] when he was sent down flying by.
[1:59:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; But the wonder of it all when he dropped
[1:59:14] down
[1:59:16] and Isaiah saw him and say, "Ah,
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; how thou fallen
[1:59:24] yet some came and worship him.
[1:59:30] They are looking for luck from him,
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; money,
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; riches."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he can only say
[1:59:41] you must kill. I want blood.
[1:59:45] Yeah. Before I can give you this and
[1:59:46] that and it's costly, man.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You must bring me blood.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; So
[1:59:58] that is his best cook.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:05] Verse eight.
[2:00:09] Maybe you don't understand.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You can buy Coke,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; sugarf free or whatever.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; But the best cook
[2:00:24] for the devil worshippers
[2:00:27] is human blood.
[2:00:31] The judgment is coming.
[2:00:35] And when he had taken the book, verse
[2:00:37] eight,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; more verse 80,
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; the four beasts and
[2:00:42] and four and 20 elders
[2:00:47] fell down before the lamb,
[2:00:51] having every one of them hs
[2:00:55] golden vials full of others,
[2:01:00] which are the prayers of saints.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, your prayer
[2:01:08] there before God.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; It gives
[2:01:16] order.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; The prayers of saints.
[2:01:23] A
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; prayer of faith,
[2:01:25] a sincere prayer.
[2:01:28] It's a sweet smell before God.
[2:01:32] It is filling the house of God.
[2:01:36] Amen. The prayers of the saints
[2:01:39] and they sung a new song saying, "Thou
[2:01:41] art worthy to take the book." Amen.
[2:01:48] Amen.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; It is not just a book.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; It is the lamb's book.
[2:01:57] Amen. No one
[2:02:00] could take that book
[2:02:02] but the lamb
[2:02:05] but the right hand.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; That's why they say give me your right
[2:02:10] hand
[2:02:13] the right hand.
[2:02:15] Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And they saw the saints.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Look
[2:02:22] all the saints.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; We started here.
[2:02:27] You find some weeping.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; All of them looking for this for the for
[2:02:35] the one worthy, the worthy one.
[2:02:40] Because they had that in themselves that
[2:02:44] my name,
[2:02:49] I've been going to and fro. I have never
[2:02:51] seen my name.
[2:02:55] As the prophet says,
[2:02:57] Your name don't say in the book don't
[2:02:59] say never.
[2:03:02] But only the book reveals.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; If you have got a name in that book when
[2:03:09] it is opened,
[2:03:12] it reveals you.
[2:03:15] Amen. And to say it is revealed to you,
[2:03:21] that's when your name is revealed to you
[2:03:25] out of the book, the book of the lamb
[2:03:29] which he has signed himself with his own
[2:03:32] blood.
[2:03:34] Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; And it's not for everybody.
[2:03:39] It's it's for those
[2:03:42] uh whose names are in that book.
[2:03:45] But all this time they they were waiting
[2:03:47] like
[2:03:49] and brother Brennham says is my book my
[2:03:53] name there?
[2:03:55] He says I don't know but what I know my
[2:03:59] my our names were written before the
[2:04:02] foundation of the world
[2:04:05] in that book.
[2:04:07] Amen. And now that's why now today
[2:04:11] we not praying and fasting and
[2:04:15] digging or so. No,
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; we we are just worshiping him
[2:04:24] who is worthy.
[2:04:27] Worship the worthy one.
[2:04:30] They sang a song. Thou art worthy to
[2:04:33] take the book.
[2:04:36] They they knew that no other man could
[2:04:40] redeem them. But the one who could
[2:04:46] has the power to take this book.
[2:04:50] Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; There is a book there, but it is
[2:04:54] mysterious.
[2:04:55] We are looking for someone who is
[2:04:57] worthy.
[2:04:59] Open the book.
[2:05:02] And the elder said, "Don't you worry.
[2:05:06] The lamp has prevailed.
[2:05:10] Take and open the book."
[2:05:13] As you hear us saying, "The lamb's book
[2:05:15] of life."
[2:05:19] It doesn't appear when the books are
[2:05:21] called out there.
[2:05:24] The bride doesn't appear there.
[2:05:28] Those in those books shall be judged.
[2:05:33] Now the bride because she's not in that
[2:05:35] book
[2:05:37] in one of those books.
[2:05:40] She is a secret.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; In the heart of God.
[2:05:48] Amen. That's why they sing a song, a new
[2:05:51] song, totally new
[2:05:54] because the one who held their secret
[2:05:58] and their names has opened to them the
[2:06:01] book.
[2:06:03] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; And
[2:06:08] the book to open the seals.
[2:06:17] Now the sixth seal
[2:06:21] is the sleeping vision
[2:06:24] with the 144,0004,000
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; in the tribulation period. It doesn't
[2:06:29] mention the seventh
[2:06:34] and because
[2:06:36] just before it loses. Yeah, we are is
[2:06:40] this route leading to to the right
[2:06:43] thing?
[2:06:46] the route we have taken.
[2:06:49] It will it will even take us up to the
[2:06:51] meeting in the air.
[2:06:55] Amen.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; This route.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Don't change. Just stay
[2:07:01] in stay in the middle.
[2:07:07] You know how God said was it to Joshua?
[2:07:11] Is it Joshua
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; where he said keep in the middle of the
[2:07:15] road? Was it Joshua to the children of
[2:07:18] Israel?
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Don't you know the scripture?
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Joshua, my friend, you just right. Keep
[2:07:26] in the middle of the road.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; He said to the children of Israel,
[2:07:31] don't. He said, don't look to the right.
[2:07:34] Don't look to the left. Amen. Just keep
[2:07:38] in the middle of the road.
[2:07:41] All right. Now, this is the root
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; taking us to a meeting in the air.
[2:07:51] Amen.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; And this is giving us the rapturing
[2:07:55] faith.
[2:08:00] You know, an eagle
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; has rapturing faith.
[2:08:05] Amen.
[2:08:07] When
[2:08:08] when the time arrives for it to take
[2:08:10] off,
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; it doesn't start and practice and so I'm
[2:08:16] practicing.
[2:08:19] No, the rapturing faith is already in
[2:08:21] it.
[2:08:24] It will just take off.
[2:08:27] Amen. And the prophet of God says
[2:08:31] you know when you come when the people
[2:08:33] are quarreling and one saying this is
[2:08:35] this one that is not that
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; the eagle
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; will never
[2:08:42] enjoy such a meeting
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; when it starts here
[2:08:50] it goes up
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; and I said amen to brother Brennham when
[2:08:55] he said amen
[2:08:58] the the the higher it goes,
[2:09:01] the better it can see.
[2:09:05] Amen.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; In the word of God, the higher you go in
[2:09:09] the word,
[2:09:11] the better you can see.
[2:09:15] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I won't settle for just a sermon
[2:09:20] for the sake of being a sermon.
[2:09:24] Amen. Amen. But I will always look up.
[2:09:28] Brother Brenham says
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; he saw it when it was caged
[2:09:36] and they're walking around
[2:09:39] but looking up.
[2:09:41] Meaning that I don't belong here.
[2:09:45] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; That's why
[2:09:50] that's why we say
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:54] I was once blind.
[2:09:58] Now I can see.
[2:10:04] Amen.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; No more turning back.
[2:10:09] I can't turn back
[2:10:11] because I've seen the beyond. You You
[2:10:15] see that? You hear you know that chorus
[2:10:17] says,
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; "I've been on the mountain and I've seen
[2:10:22] the other side."
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; I've been on the mountain and my heart
[2:10:28] is satisfied.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; This is this man singing that song.
[2:10:36] being on the mountain
[2:10:39] because right now on the mountain
[2:10:43] on top of the seven churches
[2:10:47] you are now on on the mountain
[2:10:50] and on the mountain you know
[2:10:54] there was a cry from up the mountain
[2:10:58] saying to John
[2:11:00] saying to John come hither
[2:11:06] and I will show you things to come.
[2:11:09] The things that we are seeing here, you
[2:11:12] can only see them when you are on the
[2:11:15] mountain.
[2:11:18] Amen.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Because the more you go higher,
[2:11:22] the more you see higher.
[2:11:27] Amen. Amen. And you can see what has
[2:11:29] happened there,
[2:11:32] what is happening here and what is ahead
[2:11:35] of me.
[2:11:38] Amen.
[2:11:40] That is the people of the right hand.
[2:11:45] They know where they are,
[2:11:47] where they come from, where they are
[2:11:50] going.
[2:11:55] Even if all of you can leave,
[2:11:59] I will still come to the church.
[2:12:02] Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; And I will preach to myself,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; but I don't know where shall we go,
[2:12:13] Lord.
[2:12:16] The Lord said to Peter and them,
[2:12:21] "It's time for you to choose, brethren."
[2:12:23] Why?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Why did you not go? Why did you not live
[2:12:28] with those ones?
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:33] where shall we
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; for the words of eternal life
[2:12:41] are with you?
[2:12:44] Now since we are eternal beings,
[2:12:49] we were predestinated.
[2:12:52] Where shall we go?
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Now you you came here
[2:12:58] as the h the eternal life
[2:13:03] made flesh,
[2:13:06] eternal life in in a body.
[2:13:09] Now what we see of you
[2:13:12] is what is inside of you
[2:13:16] that's why where shall we go?
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; You know if you are a true worshipper
[2:13:23] you come to a place where you can say
[2:13:25] where shall I go
[2:13:30] for I have found and seen the words of
[2:13:34] eternal life.
[2:13:36] Because if you are eternal, you will see
[2:13:39] the words of eternal life. Even even
[2:13:43] when they are in the bodies,
[2:13:46] but still because you have eternal life,
[2:13:49] you will see the words of eternal life.
[2:13:54] That's right,
[2:13:56] Peter.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; How do you know this?
[2:14:00] It is because I have eternal life.
[2:14:05] My theophony
[2:14:07] my theophony
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; connects
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; in there.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; We we he has come
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; so that we with eternal life
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; could reconnect.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; That's why he came for
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; and said Peter Phillip follow me.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; This is what he came for.
[2:14:35] He knew his own.
[2:14:38] Hallelujah.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; He never stood there with a loud hail
[2:14:41] saying, "Hallelujah, Philip, this is the
[2:14:43] gospel of Christ." He just said, "Follow
[2:14:46] me.
[2:14:50] It just connected.
[2:14:53] Connect
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; and they just stood up and followed him
[2:14:57] without asking any question
[2:15:00] because they were not looking for a
[2:15:01] church.
[2:15:03] They were looking for the Messiah.
[2:15:05] When Messiah was here, they just
[2:15:08] connected there. Connect
[2:15:12] there's no other church for us. Where
[2:15:15] shall we go? And the Samaritan woman,
[2:15:19] she couldn't connect anywhere.
[2:15:23] So she came down went to Samaritan
[2:15:25] Church of God what?
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; She couldn't she couldn't connect.
[2:15:31] Yes.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; She came out still prostituting.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; But inside there
[2:15:42] was something else.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; The difference is is down there.
[2:15:50] That's the where the difference is.
[2:15:53] Amen. Amen. So the people could look at
[2:15:56] her and say
[2:16:01] This one loves me.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; But the wonder of it
[2:16:05] is the love of God.
[2:16:08] Predestination.
[2:16:11] When God Jesus arrived.
[2:16:14] He never looked at his dresses
[2:16:19] or hairstyle or what?
[2:16:23] Amen. Because as a child of God, I don't
[2:16:26] have any hairstyle.
[2:16:28] I've got hair
[2:16:32] given to me by God.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:37] I
[2:16:41] don't shave. I don't have hair.
[2:16:49] Even if I try to leave,
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; but I still don't have God took mine
[2:16:57] earlier on.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; So I'm waiting for my hair.
[2:17:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; But you don't think I shaved. No,
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't I don't spend any
[2:17:11] money on those things.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the worthy one. Now I'm
[2:17:20] going to close so that
[2:17:22] we we we we we'll come next just we
[2:17:26] we'll come back to continue.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. God bless you.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Hallelujah.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] Hey, we are so
[2:17:49] glad I I have a young man here on
[2:17:55] I just draft things
[2:17:59] and then I hand them over to him. Then
[2:18:03] he will go
[2:18:05] and
[2:18:07] harvest.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; So then they do this for me.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Now he can spend a night with me.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Comes and spend a night
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; when I run these things
[2:18:25] with my hand and give to him.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; So it's helping me here.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; It's just I'm trying to make things
[2:18:33] easier.
[2:18:35] You right.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; We close with this.
[2:18:41] That is now if I come let let me see his
[2:18:45] body now. The body of Christ.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Let let us read here. Now you you have
[2:18:54] seen all of the right
[2:18:58] coming down the right hand side.
[2:19:02] Mhm.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; His wife.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Revelation. I want to read something
[2:19:10] here again. Revelation 10
[2:19:14] verse 1 to3.
[2:19:19] Do you've got it?
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. And I saw another mighty angel
[2:19:26] come down from heaven clothed with a
[2:19:29] cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head,
[2:19:33] and his face was as it were the sun, and
[2:19:37] his feet as the pillars of fire. And he
[2:19:40] had in his hand a little book open. Then
[2:19:44] he set his right foot upon the sea, and
[2:19:47] his left foot on the earth, and cried
[2:19:51] with a loud voice. And as when a lion
[2:19:54] roarth, and when he had cried, seven
[2:19:57] thunders uttered their voices.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; But
[2:20:08] that is the gospel, brother. Amen.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:21] meaning that
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; we
[2:20:32] are
[2:20:36] the bride of Christ
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; in the midst of angels.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I saw
[2:20:48] another mighty angel
[2:20:51] come down from heaven
[2:20:54] clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was upon
[2:20:57] his head
[2:20:59] and his face
[2:21:02] as it were the sun, his feet as pillars
[2:21:06] of fire.
[2:21:10] Here is the book again. And he had in
[2:21:13] his hand
[2:21:16] a little book.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; If I were asked maybe
[2:21:30] do you want to worship God?
[2:21:35] And they would say to me, choose the
[2:21:38] place where you'd want to go for to
[2:21:41] worship.
[2:21:43] I will read these scriptures and say, "I
[2:21:47] want to worship here.
[2:21:52] When I can see this mighty angel come
[2:21:54] down
[2:21:57] with a cloud rain, I I I want to worship
[2:22:01] here.
[2:22:03] I don't need oil coffee and I enough at
[2:22:08] my home.
[2:22:11] I'm I'm even warned not to take too much
[2:22:13] coffee.
[2:22:17] So I don't need all those things.
[2:22:20] I not I don't need favor.
[2:22:24] No, I only need to be under this place,
[2:22:29] this ministry
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; where I'm told here's an angel. The
[2:22:35] angels are coming to that place. You
[2:22:36] know,
[2:22:40] the book is coming down from there to
[2:22:42] the place.
[2:22:44] I want to worship
[2:22:47] at such a place when things that God has
[2:22:52] sent down
[2:22:54] would have come my way.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's why he says here now now he had a
[2:23:01] book again. Here's a book
[2:23:03] opened. Now this time it is opened.
[2:23:09] Amen.
[2:23:11] It was sealed
[2:23:13] a book sealed
[2:23:16] seven.
[2:23:18] Amen.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Will come to seal the back. It has the
[2:23:22] backside
[2:23:25] because you have the seven church ages.
[2:23:28] You got the seven seals.
[2:23:30] So the book now
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; uh is the back side
[2:23:37] the back side of the book is the
[2:23:39] mysteries.
[2:23:42] Is that right? Because the backside
[2:23:46] will tell you that you know there's a a
[2:23:49] part here
[2:23:52] the book of seals I think the the the
[2:23:55] back side of the of the book
[2:24:00] we will follow it because it is even the
[2:24:05] h
[2:24:07] where it is
[2:24:11] I just want to I'm going to get you this
[2:24:14] one here.
[2:24:16] uh because of uh running to and fro some
[2:24:20] of the things I've got to as you see
[2:24:23] things are sticking out of here so so
[2:24:25] that I can be able to run
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; all the way again all the way back
[2:24:35] from Genesis
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; this seventh
[2:24:40] seal
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; is spoken of
[2:24:46] from the very beginning.
[2:24:51] Amen.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's why the people can't see it.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; uh
[2:25:05] John uh John chapter one here in Ghana,
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; that which was from the beginning,
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; that which was
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; from the beginning,
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; from the beginning
[2:25:16] which we have
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Now that is from from
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; from the beginning.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; So now a child of God,
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. I'm closing
[2:25:36] now.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; You if you are predestinated,
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; you don't have a beginning.
[2:25:44] Amen.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; But now before the beginning
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; already you could see
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; and you could hear
[2:25:55] before the beginning
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; out there when the beginning started.
[2:26:03] You you you were able to see
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; the beginning.
[2:26:10] And so because you were before the
[2:26:13] beginning,
[2:26:16] those who were there before the
[2:26:17] beginning
[2:26:19] could see the beginning
[2:26:23] could hear what was spoken there.
[2:26:28] Amen. That's why
[2:26:30] to today we are still going to to to
[2:26:34] read and you'll we will come to a place
[2:26:39] where it says book of revelation
[2:26:43] the bride
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; and
[2:26:47] the
[2:26:49] spirit and the bride
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; the spirit and the bride
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; say come
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; you see
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[2:26:59] and the bride.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; So when can you trace back where the
[2:27:04] spirit started to say something?
[2:27:10] Amen.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; You know as the Bible says of things
[2:27:13] here it was not so.
[2:27:17] It was not so from the beginning.
[2:27:21] Amen.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; There was no divorce. There was no these
[2:27:24] things from from there
[2:27:28] because God has no beginning.
[2:27:32] Now the people who were there,
[2:27:35] they have seen the beginning.
[2:27:39] Amen. Amen.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; These are the people who will come today
[2:27:44] and say to you
[2:27:46] what you are doing was not so.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; They have seen it back there.
[2:27:54] So they know how it should be like.
[2:27:57] They know what Christianity should be
[2:27:59] like
[2:28:01] because they were there.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; They saw it.
[2:28:09] Amen.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:13] They talk about the fallen angels.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; No. And
[2:28:20] the spirits. Let me close. I'm going to
[2:28:23] continue reading here.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; If you find a demon,
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; as my prophet says,
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; these demons,
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; they know better
[2:28:45] why they were
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; they are fallen, but they were there.
[2:28:54] So
[2:28:56] they are standing here as let me type to
[2:29:00] you this for one minute.
[2:29:04] Here they are standing
[2:29:06] again I'm saying it and here's a
[2:29:09] Pharisee
[2:29:11] and here's a demon.
[2:29:15] Now you listen who's going to say the
[2:29:17] right thing?
[2:29:21] concerning Jesus.
[2:29:24] Will it be a demon or a Pharisee?
[2:29:27] A
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; demon
[2:29:30] demon comes and say,
[2:29:33] "Thou art the son of the living God."
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; And they they say next you pastor, you
[2:29:45] come and give your testimony.
[2:29:49] Are you
[2:29:52] Mary's child?
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; That is his testimony.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; But the test the testimony of a demon
[2:30:00] differs.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "Have you come to judge us
[2:30:08] already?" That that's a demon now.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; And the father say,
[2:30:14] "I know him.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; His mother is Mary. His father is a
[2:30:18] carpenter. There
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; you see the difference.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Even it's the same thing today. Don't
[2:30:26] you see it?
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; A demon will tell you better of a child
[2:30:33] of God about the child of God
[2:30:36] than a so-called
[2:30:38] Christian
[2:30:40] brother in the message.
[2:30:47] If you want to get the truth,
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; you call them
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; and ask a demon,
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; who is this?
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, this one is the son of God. Yeah, he
[2:31:02] Yeah. But ask a so-called Christian,
[2:31:15] but not a demon. The demon knows better.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Can you see it? So,
[2:31:28] you know, we can't listen to the demons,
[2:31:29] but
[2:31:31] if we were allowed
[2:31:38] for a demon,
[2:31:43] but but
[2:31:47] so we're not allowed to go ask demons.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; It says you must cast them out.
[2:31:54] Yet
[2:31:57] Jesus Christ says Satan is a liar and
[2:32:00] the father of it.
[2:32:04] Now listen,
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; but he stood there on the mountain
[2:32:12] and Satan came
[2:32:15] to to test him. Now the Bible don't tell
[2:32:19] us that. Jesus said,
[2:32:24] Jesus didn't say to him, "I don't talk
[2:32:25] to Satan." No, he stood there.
[2:32:33] I said, "Can you see the whole world?
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; I have it under my
[2:32:40] throw yourself down from this mountain.
[2:32:44] When you wake up, I'll give you the
[2:32:46] whole thing."
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was listening.
[2:32:52] It is written.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written.
[2:32:58] He didn't change. You know that
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ says to Satan,
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; not Satan.
[2:33:07] Listening to him talking
[2:33:10] and says, "It is written."
[2:33:13] Satan brings another written.
[2:33:16] If we were like that
[2:33:19] every time Satan comes to test us we say
[2:33:22] it is written
[2:33:25] today even we can say it is revealed.
[2:33:30] [cheering]
[2:33:30] Amen.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; We shall not worship any other god.
[2:33:36] We shall not belong to church but to
[2:33:38] Christ.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Because church is a woman.
[2:33:44] Amen. If she's not converted, she loves
[2:33:49] fish and what what
[2:33:52] now? It is written.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; It is re today. I can say it is
[2:33:57] revealed.
[2:34:01] Can you see it friends? Now
[2:34:07] today we'll leave
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; to take some rounds and back again.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Then we'll come back again.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Just after
[2:34:16] six six minutes.
[2:34:20] Amen.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; A day is a minute to me.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; You see I'm leaving the pulpit.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; But before
[2:34:31] but before you say we'll be right back
[2:34:32] here.
[2:34:34] Okay.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Pray for me also.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; And
[2:34:40] God is helping us. Uh something
[2:34:43] something
[2:34:45] is happening.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, something is happening and very
[2:34:50] very soon we are going to see the king.
[2:34:55] Amen. And the people have already
[2:34:58] started
[2:35:00] working towards that
[2:35:03] because he is coming
[2:35:08] and I come to you and you come to me.
[2:35:14] Yes.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; So this is happening now. He's coming to
[2:35:21] us. We are also going to him. We shall
[2:35:24] meet in the air.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; As we stand up. Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; I suggest you put them like this. Yeah.

[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing, Father, to be here this
[2:38:48] morning,
[2:38:51] especially gracious heavenly father, to
[2:38:53] hear
[2:38:55] the mysterious things that were hidden
[2:38:58] before the foundation of the world.
[2:39:03] Just a mere mind, Lord, to recognize
[2:39:08] that we'll be sitting with you and
[2:39:10] judging. Father,
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; to a normal mind is just a farfetched
[2:39:16] thing. Father,
[2:39:20] just to think that, Father,
[2:39:23] you processed us from thyself. Lord, we
[2:39:27] are your offsprings. We're your
[2:39:29] children. And your seed that comes from
[2:39:33] thee.
[2:39:36] Heavenly Father, thank you
[2:39:39] for bringing us here and and thank you
[2:39:42] father for giving us the right direction
[2:39:46] and for giving us a shepherd, gracious
[2:39:49] Lord
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; that showed us
[2:39:53] where the green pastures are.
[2:39:56] and gracious heavenly father
[2:39:59] for giving us relevant food,
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; a ministry that is relevant to the time
[2:40:07] that we're living in. Father,
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; we've been reading scriptures that says
[2:40:15] there will be groaning,
[2:40:18] groaning for the manifestations of the
[2:40:20] sons of God. Amen.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Today we see
[2:40:26] the prophecy being manifested, Lord.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; And today we see
[2:40:33] the manifestations of the sons of God.
[2:40:36] Gracious heaven,
[2:40:38] our prophet taught us that John the
[2:40:40] Baptist
[2:40:43] prophesied about him and ended up
[2:40:46] pointing him.
[2:40:49] And when he came, Lord,
[2:40:51] you came, Father, to manifest
[2:40:55] what John the Baptist
[2:40:58] was prophesying about.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; And Father,
[2:41:02] this morning again, we are seeing the
[2:41:04] very same thing.
[2:41:07] The manifestations
[2:41:09] of all the divine promises, Father,
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; especially in this time. Thank you,
[2:41:15] Father.
[2:41:18] We raise our hands.
[2:41:20] We adore thee, Lord. And we will worship
[2:41:24] thee, Father. And gracious heavenly
[2:41:27] father, thank you once again
[2:41:30] to know that when the prophet says,
[2:41:34] "The word is now in the bride."
[2:41:37] Father, that is manifested, Lord, even
[2:41:40] to this morning. Thank you, Father.
[2:41:44] Bless each and every heart that has a
[2:41:48] space for these things that were said
[2:41:51] here and bless our pastor here
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; and bless the church
[2:41:58] and father with the revelation that you
[2:42:00] have given us. We will manage to see our
[2:42:04] positions in the new Jerusalem.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; We managed to see our positions Lord
[2:42:10] Almighty in the word.
[2:42:14] There was a prophecy that says, "He that
[2:42:17] overcomemeth,
[2:42:18] I will give him to eat from the hidden
[2:42:22] manner."
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Father, we are eating from the hidden
[2:42:26] manner. And in that manner that you are
[2:42:28] eating in, Father,
[2:42:31] you gave us a white stone
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; and Father, we could see our name in
[2:42:36] that white stone.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; We like to thank you, Father.
[2:42:41] May you bless each and everyone Lord
[2:42:45] and gracious heavenly father. Thank you
[2:42:47] once again. We are looking forward for
[2:42:50] more of these. Thank you father in the
[2:42:53] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:42:55] [music] we pray. Amen.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; [applause]

[3:32:20] scripture there after
[3:32:26] let us pray.
[3:32:29] Gracious almighty father
[3:32:40] to stand with you.
[3:32:42] We are thankful because this is
[3:32:46] Prophet once said that your word will be
[3:32:48] preached and heavenly father when the
[3:32:51] names of the believers are called they
[3:32:54] will respond. Father here they are they
[3:32:56] have responded to that call of the
[3:32:58] mighty angel. Father as they are coming
[3:33:01] to be baptized in the name of our Lord
[3:33:03] Jesus Christ. We say let all the
[3:33:05] promises of the scriptures be given unto
[3:33:08] them. Heavenly father we pray for this
[3:33:10] whole session and the brothers that will
[3:33:12] be performing the duty. We say let it
[3:33:15] all happen to bring glory and honor to
[3:33:17] your name. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[3:33:23] Acts chapter 2 verse 36-39.
[3:33:40] Acts 2 from verse 36.
[3:33:45] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:33:47] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:33:50] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[3:33:53] Lord and Christ. Now, when they heard
[3:33:56] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:33:58] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[3:34:01] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:34:04] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:34:07] them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[3:34:10] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:34:12] the remissions of sins, and ye shall
[3:34:15] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:34:17] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:34:21] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:34:24] even as many as the Lord
[3:34:27] the Lord or God shall call."
[3:34:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you as they come forth.
