Description:
Title: Everything That Was Created Has An End 
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 23 July 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience that everything that was created has an end.

The pastor reads the following scriptures: 

Revelation 22: 12-13, 16-17; 

The Blood test shows whether you’re  of God’s or not. God was not created, He was always God. There’s no place He was created. And the only way that we can ever have Eternal Life is to be part of that creation. Our Spirit’s were not created but it was processed. 

The Word has to bring a manifestation, reading the Spoken Word it is just reading, if that word is not manifested in you. We must manifest what Bro Branham preached  about. When you are manifested you become a dwelling place for God.

He read the following quotes:

60-1206 - "The Smyrnaean Church Age par 120

64-0614M - "The Unveiling Of God par 242-245

going to read from the book here it's mine Church age page 2 11 2 11. and let's just start with 130 yeah let's read the whole paragraphs but I will uh read up to this party yeah and where it says anything that head beginning yes okay I mean now usually you will read for me amen rather from paragraph 180. draw more paragraph 130 is it 180 yes let us read the whole paragraph Here Comes amen and the blood test shows whether you are gods or not see your God's children and you have eternal life but the soul that sinneth that Soul shall be separated is that right then it will be no more now look anything that had a beginning has an end because anything that had a beginning is a creation but God was not created he was always God and there's no place he was created and the only way that we can ever have eternal life is to be part of that creation Glory or if we could see it see what the Holy Ghost does for you is is the Holy Ghost the Creator himself God the father in the form of a spirit called the Holy Ghost because it was upon the body called Jesus his son that he created Jesus the body that's the reason it had to die God dwelt in this human flesh and the blood cell was broke and the life and the blood cell come back amen amen amen so I'm going to reach some few things actually the brothers asked me to remove this lose part here amen okay yeah but tomorrow will be uh fixing it the dentist or dentisting okay you saw you are glad to be here firstly I'm going to dwell on this everything that was created talking about creation how are you their daughter you come and see me in the office there okay should I remove it all right it will it will get off by itself everything is and yet you read God created heaven and earth then the same scripture tells you that is Heaven and Earth shall pass away I mean and yet God created but they shall pass away what will remain that was not created I believe we'll be seriously and see who we are and where we are blessed are they who read these books you are blessed you don't just become a follower of the message but you become the message I want to read this party it says we [Music] and outside amen amen uh they they think we we are crazy that's right but we who are in here in Christ so he's talking from the inside baptized into him that are in here in Christ preaching from them because if you are outside you will preach the things of outside but if you are inside you'll bring the word from the initiality and that's the difference that's why friends you see I don't hate anybody even if my brother don't understand like myself I won't say anything against that it is predestinated I thank God for what he made me trust me if somebody is not like me I won't criticize amen amen because me also I thank God for what he has made me that's all ah man the unveiling of God okay I mean um it says we are still veiled to them outside us because we have insiders they like an Outsiders is an impersonator [Music] there's so much impersonation today of The Outsiders who will listen to the Insiders and take the word a challenge preached by the Insiders they haven't received that word is yes [Music] all right you understand that now let me read here we are still veiled [Music] and let me pass yes [Applause] it says who so now we are invited into him remember to be partakers of all that he is we are invited into him remember which is hit to unbelievers what what amen now I want you to take note of this is to be partakers of all that he is because Paul says I preach him and him crucified that's why we we are here to preach him amen now listen to this we are invited to be no you we don't invite you to to church the way that we preach it's an invitation to be invited into um [Applause] I'm in to be particles of all that she is [Applause] not of all that he says of all that he is because we preach him call him and him crucified so I read yeah they know the glory they read of it is the glory of God I mean don't be surprised the why God is going to judge the people it is because after they have seen that is knowing exactly that this is the word of God hearing so now I'll turn to this one so now we are invited into him usually remember yeah it is no more all right all right all right amen that we're talking about the glory of God to them is just a word you know like to you if it is just the way and you even talk about it you preach but it's just the way you see the difference here the prophet is talking here now and things like that just a worthy to them but to us it's a manifestation now you've got to see between the weight and the manifestation foreign [Music] and then age that was the way so if you say we are going to preach this way we will continue to say yes age is that right now see what I mean that's why Paul says I'll teach him then it continues now we see him amen [Applause] all right amen that's what we are looking at [Music] but what about you yeah are you the manifestation because if it says if he says let there be light and there was life now it's normal a word amen all right amen just like you now you are you are here the word has been manifested you are the manifestation Prada amen amen amen now it's no longer well it's [Music] now God can't repeat again how many here are manifestations because it's starting with a church goals a person who just comes to change that's all and then but you have the way the dwelling place of God because if you are manifested you are a Dwelling Place of God amen now we have come here anything that had a beginning yes if you begin hello when the end comes you will leave [Applause] they left because they were not of us foreign the two beginning the one says that Genesis God created and everything that was created that's why in
