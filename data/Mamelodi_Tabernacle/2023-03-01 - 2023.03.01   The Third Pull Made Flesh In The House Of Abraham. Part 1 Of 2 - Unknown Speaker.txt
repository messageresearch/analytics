TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] come on baby [Music] assistant [Music] oh sisters and brothers yeah our peace be with you uh please be with you okay you may be seated for a while we is this the last day or the beginning okay yeah this is the first day of the services that we will have here foreign oh I guess okay brothers and sisters it's for you to know that way too a wonderful time we are having here is the Pastor said yesterday that it doesn't stop here because we'll be carrying it with us I really love it the word of God is not kept in the church amen and in our hearts eighties Wednesday too we don't just keep any word because the framework that is in us our souls the prophet says he is the mind which was in Christ now the only word that can come and remain there easy the word that proceedeth out of his mouth he is she went from this church to that church in search of the Messiah efunana no Messiah she knew that the Messiah will come down through a certain religious line why is [Music] she thought that way Messiah will come through a certain denominations she had not yet received the Revelation because the Messiah don't come through any observation um it's something that will catch up with you in your soul is then I read your Funda and I will read Uncle I'm just introducing to you something uh amen amen and let me just quote it again another book there yeah this woman Lois fazad she had something in here [Music] the prophet as he says we have little Stones John Prophet she was because if you want to keep a record of something you should use as to um [Music] the Lord Jesus Christ to Peter Thou Art zephas meaning a little Stone then later he said then Upon This Rock I will build my church because the stone is a uh and a device that can carry whatever for ages when the Apollo we were told of Apollo Apollo that when they reached the moon we are told like this and we are told that when they arrived back they had this is what we are told the Americans because in every stone there's some layers that can even indicate the the age of the area yes you must find a stone toilet Jesus is the Rock of Ages [Music] in him all the ages are registered let's stand up and read the word of God I guess I just want to look at the Deadpool catch up if I'm like I'm saying to you [Music] uh-huh you are being pulled we are done so silence means not me um I'm not fooled at all let's try it I guess it's uh let's open Hebrews chapter 11 verse 11. 11 verse 11. somebody read it for usai [Music] through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen yeah I recently read this in mamelodi and a brother said pastor we are going to Swaziland I think we are going to continue I said okay I will continue yeah the second scripture is Genesis Chapter 18 um Genesis 18 verse 9 to 11. or rather to 14 to 14. attending why you say tea why is it is [Music] foreign and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah had it in the turned door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it seems to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I'm waxed old shall I have a pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I off surely bear a child which I'm old is there anything to hurt for the Lord and the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son heavenly father is another wonderful time yeah here we've been this a privilege again to come in this place just to hear the way that was spoken yeah and father as the children of Abraham we come here father believing that we will receive the very same that Abraham has received and we are so glad to bless every brother and sister under this roof father God saw that by the time we leave this place we would be the happiest people in this world today as I pray in Jesus Christ's name for the reading of your word to be given revelation after this word is put in our hearts as I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be citizens you will understand I won't belong here I don't uh I I don't want to regret this day as the last day it will it will kill me but I will just say it's one of the days amen yeah now I want to read to you something foreign start [Music] made flesh in the house of Abraham oh well thank you Saints I was reading being fooled about the Samaritan women just to redeem time let me just quote it again it says it this summer is she had a little something in her why not work as if God wants you to meet you at a certain appointed time yes he has to put something in you let me repeat to you again I've seen some I love to watch wildlife myself so I've seen it how these people wouldn't abandon they go deep into the jungle I'm twist there with some thoughts about your mind to trace the life of a lion because sometimes you just see a lion at the Zoological Gardens how it was groomed up just see it when it is a grown up amen yeah so these people together they go in trying to start from scratch to see the birth of that lion the manner of that lion um and until it is an adult now for them to do that since the lions look alike they are use a device then every time they come up to follow the process it can be so they come with a receiver um now with this receiver they will start going around in that area and until they can receive some blips [Music] about tonight coming out of their device then they know that the lion is in this area so they will follow the blips yeah [Music] as the blips grow more noisy [Music] um you know that we are close until they can locate that lion I think they copied this from God because God has put something in the Samaritan woman the Bible says she had that in here the Messiah is coming I'm going to repeat to you some things in order to get to this again now she used to stand on the streets as you know how prostitutes operate today she will come with the highest hills today and the shortest tomorrow salsa she comes with transparency again like that beyond that there was something in here now when Jesus arrived at the well M to Jane as he followed the blips because she has he has put something in that woman now Jesus was in now now in the area because the woman was in that area hmm fuse me is to go to Samaria because of this woman you tell brother timoth I was preaching foreign it caused the Lord Jesus Christ just take a walk to that place there were some other people as he was passing by oh my God he he he went down especially for that woman while when he was in the area what my closest court that woman was a prostitute but he didn't disturb the Lord Jesus Christ he went for the innermost of that woman the thing that he has put in there amen yeah you know you know when he said to um Jesse we asking uh when some will arrive there the prophet um well uh is it Jesse yes who produced his sons now as usual Danger he probably he said with this Sons I want you to conduct you in a good man protect yourself in a good manner I want to you to look nice [Music] before the prophet nice and you I know your stubborn but you must stop it the prophet was now in the house confusion prophet so here comes the prophets now Jesse push the first son like a beauty contest um foreign I don't look at the good contacts no I don't look at that I go deep yeah to find what is inside this okay sorry to God amen amen my dealings are with the innermost maintenance so God rejected them all okay they were all surprised foreign Hallelujah Joseph Anthony Joseph came to Ayah Joseph said will you join me to go to Rama and Joseph had said your people are my people your roses my horses Joseph kindness we are brothers and then what happened Joseph I said shall we inquire at the word of the Lord today yes these are the people who didn't just Venture into things they went fast when you get into into a hotel which place do you touch before you go in here reception reception a reception so before they could go to warm pain they had to go fast reception buying the way to say Lord shall I go if God says no um so now after that let me cut the truth um after Ahab called has called His prophets people today are calling their yeah they don't like God's prophets they want their own Prophets because God's prophets of the Lord Jehovah now Joseph he also fought had 400 why not 400. they come with one word shall I go to work he said that is Joseph josephat was watching after that he said now Joseph how was the service is there not another one okay from whom we can foreign but yet deeper there is another one from whom you can inquire um Ahab said yes there is another one whom we can inquire but I don't like that he doesn't prophesy nice to me he's a danger to me when God's lawyer like in me every time when he is he wouldn't he wouldn't say anything nice he will dismantle me until I fall down Joseph and says what to Joseph King that very same one you know Messengers were sent out when they arrived they said prophet of God Prophet um prophesied there I need 400 yeah 400 made profits yeah Services out the professor in favor of the king or everybody yeah the service went well brother who Micah what color he started amen Amen Let the king proceed then he came that we beg you brother oh this time now we go prophesy nice so that the nation can rejoice and scissors Thomas [Music] [Music] I'm going to say what God has put in my heart um we don't worship to please no it is what God has put in my heart this one has already started he arrived I he said to the king our King you may proceed and the vision came down and he said didn't I tell you so they locked him in Long Way they say close him in yeah we won't be successful if we work with this one close them in lock them in there you can you could see that Prophet um prophet behind the bus you shall not return yeah when this Prophet says something it happens he went into war with fear but love alive I disguise I haven't put on a um but the enemy what do I See It Came Upon them that it should be that one yeah we had some lipsticks they hit directly to him the prophet has spoken prophet now yes sir that's why Jesse said yeah there is just a small boy he's heading the ship and the prophet said Prophet words [Music] amen yeah bring that one yeah I want the very one there is yet one man yeah among the prophets from whom we can inquire of the word of the Lord yes the world hates him Sarah Sarah here is something for few minutes amen amen Sarah was old well-stricken in age but at that time Dallas was cut because it was going Beyond it was now Beyond time is and then as I'm going to read to you this year now you watch and listen closely guys God has promised Abraham now here he says spoken word is it doesn't need fast to pray or what it's a promise given by God himself his personal is in your house so you need to pray after he did Cabo if God says go wait in Jerusalem I will send the Holy Ghost so they just go and wait God has promised that even if one can start to pray that would mean nothing normal if God promises something um the one who is he is also able we have ones who will fulfill who fails the way that he himself it's God who said he wrote and send unto you Elijah the problems no matter what the world says but still he will fulfill is but another thing I want you to understand I will send unto you sisters and like if I say behold I have sent Elijah is good I will send Elijah unto you now first of all you are going to expect and wait for Elijah to come outside he says if a man opens the dog hears my voice and open the door I will come into him is not looking at that door he's not knocking at that door he's looking at your dog that one cannot open the door because before the the looking is not at his door because God never promised him Elijah it won't open for Elijah because he will only receive from God to what he has promised you won't take any another person's thing so he has promised Abraham now God um the Bible says little bible it happened to Sarah once she has passed H I said today is are you listening my friends why God waited until she has passed age what why why she was wanting to be um until she was old was then God comes and says God never addressed them as foreign I was at the Victoria Falls Victoria Falls this is my brother my sister today we came to a place leading to a place called uh boiling point in the outside boiling point so you need to walk down there so the Deacon in the church there in Livingston the living Stone said to me again Pastor it's an effort to go down and to come back he said pastor I don't know I said when we are here I said are you going yourself yeah he said yes I am also going he has looked at me um and so that died this one is old I mean yeah so what you oh God I said I asked will you be able yourself I said myself [Music] until we came back we bypass some of the people hanging like this on the rocks amen um don't allow yourself to age inside Hallelujah this is going to board yeah Hallelujah I know my redeemer yeah the body was in trouble then he looked or big and that he said what in my flesh I shall see God then he started to see my job yes yes I know [Music] amen at the end um he saw the job he has defied terrible plague on her body work foreign [Music] so this man LED totally even the wife came and said Curse God and died suffer like this um amen amen and job said job I know yes after he has tested me I'll come forth as gold is [Music] and truly he came forth as goals instead God said to those men who accused job of a hidden sin amen he said to job but good job foreign [Music] listen foreign [Music] foreign then the cheese eating and where is my brother gum oh yeah so the bride um is looking for the promised son um before the pregnant son could come is their bodies had to be changed she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breast it is so what happened God changed her back to a young woman amen and 40 he did Abraham the same for he said his body was as good as dead he had to change their body in order to receive the promise this promised son the daughter was the spoken word yes now God had to wait for them to get older and older [Music] than when they were older because the promised son was coming through their inner moves so the Bible says through faith nice I'll tell you amen yeah through and coronary it didn't it didn't say by faith but Abraham or Abraham he said by faith Abraham it says through Italy because Faith was already there in Columbus Abraham because the seed is with Abraham the city now that woman in foreign substance substance of things hoped for it with Bambi sources there are six sense without faith so Sarah saw the face of Abraham and she believed through that and conceived came through faith not through a specialist I am a specialist still are you here my friends have faith in God don't look at the circumstances don't look at the hardness of your problems is a God who wants to demonstrate now for him to demonstrate he organized that a man should follow um God knew about it he could block it but because he wanted to demonstrate he wanted to restore a fallen man um and demonstrate all right amen that is the law of God he said to Moses Moses where most when things looked so hard and he said to Moses Moses I want you to know this thing I have hardened Pharaoh's heart is God says to Moses if you see pharaohs remains so stubborn amen the stubbornness of pharaoh came from me [Music] why Lord why Lord so that they can see my power Amanda um God don't want to fight weak things okay that's why he says when the enemy seasoning comes like a flood I will Mina is amen don't worry don't worry if you see um utana don't do don't look at the clouds look at the god if you come against a tall mountain um don't look at the mountains amen that's why I said to the this couple that couple yeah they exhausted they are medical AIDS went from this from The Specialist Specialists and the specialist said oh special it is impossible for you to Bear a child and what else but we can do an operation but as an act means that that's a specialist especially which is a risk you've got to sign for this before we signed the Leyland because she can end up a crippled woman so I said now I want to hear from you much do you want a child from a specialist or from God specialist my brother do you want a child from a specialist or from God [Music] you want to be healed by a specialist or by God all right I received a phone called this morning past one Past One in telephone call from Pretoria a very Pretoria saying it there from atteridgeville the daughters of a mama
