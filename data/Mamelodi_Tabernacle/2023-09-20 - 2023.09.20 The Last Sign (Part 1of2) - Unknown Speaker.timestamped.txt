[6:28] [Music]
[6:31] and the prophet of God says we can't go
[6:34] further Prophet the duty
[6:39] and this is just the engineer ing
[6:44] so we are looking at the
[6:49] last sign don't you know someone kind of
[6:54] regardless
[6:54] [Music]
[6:56] something that helps you that it's
[7:00] foreign
[7:28] [Music]
[7:32] that what was once God's Great Secret
[7:40] once God's great secretary
[7:44] [Music]
[7:49] the great mystery mysterious Secret in
[7:54] his mind
[8:00] is now put in the hearts of
[8:04] men maintenance
[8:07] [Music]
[8:10] made
[8:12] yes
[8:14] [Music]
[8:17] amen amen
[8:20] now I think we will we will come to
[8:23] terms that the place of God is the heart
[8:26] of man amen
[8:28] [Music]
[8:31] will come to terms with that fact
[8:35] that here that position of God
[8:41] is in a place
[8:58] [Music]
[9:04] men in them
[9:11] now in the Tabernacle there is a place
[9:15] there was a place in the oldest man
[9:19] called a holy of holies foreign
[9:24] [Music]
[9:46] [Music]
[9:54] you must know where God is
[10:02] because God is an object of worship
[10:05] [Music]
[10:08] amen now those who worship their son
[10:14] they look at the Sun
[10:16] [Music]
[10:18] those who worship a certain
[10:21] statues
[10:24] they come involved before the stage
[10:27] [Music]
[10:30] now those who worship God save the other
[10:34] till they come to where it is
[10:44] he has to identify himself if do I
[10:48] remember sit on TV where the Lord Jesus
[10:52] Christ is many First Steps
[10:56] [Music]
[10:59] not only where the uh where the peoples
[11:04] talk about him
[11:08] you know you you
[11:11] find a place where the people will talk
[11:14] about God
[11:18] that's why you find differences
[11:25] [Music]
[11:32] a worshiper will go walk past that place
[11:42] if you're not the wrong dude
[11:45] God is not a water of confusion
[11:51] so if I come to a place
[11:56] I realize that people are talking about
[11:58] God
[12:01] then I know that is not the place
[12:11] is when he is manifested
[12:18] where he is manifested love is when he
[12:22] is made known now he then manifestation
[12:32] amen that's how we worship God
[13:04] [Music]
[13:35] [Music]
[13:36] because as we said yesterday since
[13:40] the mystery of God is not in the book
[13:44] [Music]
[13:50] you know I during the time of services
[14:03] the Philistine they couldn't see the
[14:08] mystery the Improvement of his power the
[14:12] selfishness
[14:33] amen
[14:37] [Music]
[14:50] they
[14:52] knew that is
[14:54] since after they couldn't find the
[14:57] mystery

[16:11] um
[16:11] that one thing is God and the man
[16:16] the whole thing
[16:19] is
[16:22] that means the whole Mysteries
[16:30] [Music]
[16:32] and God and man was one two alone
[16:38] and God and man is one year children

[17:43] it was a perfect reflection
[17:47] reflection perfect on the highest in
[17:51] heaven
[17:54] Hallelujah when God made men

[26:29] through the seven churchages
[26:33] the message was coming to the change the
[26:38] message
[26:39] but the Seven Seals many said so the
[26:44] message is coming out of the church the
[26:48] message is
[26:51] but now they

[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] which was
[35:25] in the form of a rainbow
[35:32] [Music]
[35:36] the spirit of God
[35:38] in the form of a rainbow it is
[35:43] now if you come down down through the
[35:46] Sunday now the logos
[35:48] will still remain seven in the form of
[35:51] the logos
[35:53] amen don't come again
[35:59] [Music]
[36:07] now Jesus and see Jesus was Sevenfold he

[38:21] [Music]
[38:28] another person
[38:33] amen amen
[38:41] all right
[38:44] it is what we call that the soul since
[38:51] the soul is in the heart
[38:57] the soul is not the heart
[39:00] the soul is in their heart
[39:05] and just like Christ second Christian
[39:09] Christ was in the men Jesus
