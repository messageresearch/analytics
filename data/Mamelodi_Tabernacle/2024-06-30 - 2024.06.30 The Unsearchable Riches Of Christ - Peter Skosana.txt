Description:
Title: The unsearchable riches of Christ   
Preached By Elder Peter Skosana  at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 31 June 2024.

The Elder read the following scriptures:

Ephesians 3:2-9; Acts 13:45; Romans 8:19; Luke 4:21; Ephesians 1:17 ; John 6:62-63; Revelation 1:1-2; Revelation 22:6-9

The purpose of the sermon was to show the people about the unsearchable riches of Christ.

Our Prophet’s ministry was to change the heart of the children back to their fathers, it is a dispensation, it’s a commission. He was given a new Commission , which is the one that causes separation. There is another commission that is not written, it is called the 3rd Pull, the Seventh Seal, they just run concurrently. We have the manifestation of the Son’s of God and we have the revelation of the Son  of Men, these are different dispensations but they run simultaneously, if you miss them you miss the target.  After changing the heart of the children back to their fathers, then comes the new Commission. The 3rd Pull is a new Commission. The new commission is not for the public. 

This message doesn’t need your mind it needs the revelation. 
We can all be seating here listening from the same Preacher but hearing different things, because we are all coming from different dimensions. The ministry of the Seventh Seal it has to do with our inheritance, it is an Angelic ministry. 

He is in his throne which is our heart in a form of the word.  People want to understand instead of having a revelation, understanding is for educational purposes. The word of God has to do with a Revelation, which goes with a predestination.
The mystery of God has nothing to do with your mind it is all by revelation. 

When God visit you and express himself to you, that is the unsearchable riches. The unsearchable riches it is something that is not written. 
You cannot change the journey of a predestinated person. 
Your inheritance is in another dimension. God is omnipresent  he is currently in different places. 
This my...

a seven s the following day [Music] only 14000 [Music] SMS after year from police station case dismissed untraceable Tri [Music] and our wonderful Pastor amen hallelujah I'm going to summarize what the sister has just said her name is Sister bus Masina from W Bank sister Bim Masina she started by thanking God for the revelation of the seventh seal and of the third pool and thanking the pastor and and the for not giving up on them H she had a docket issue she says that in 2022 there was a lady who was selling her house for a for 100,000 she then H popped out 80,000 uh towards the payment of the house and the the lady of the house the seller then promises that after a month I am going to move out and then you will come in and then after a month the sister went and then the said did not want to move out anymore she said now the price has went up it's no longer 100,000 it's now 140 and then um the sister escalated the matter to the police and then she opened a case against the seller and H the case was stagnant for a period of a year nothing happened and then when she went to ask about the progress of the case she was told that H it's still under investigation and then after a year uh she she went back uh to she got a message from the police station saying that uh the case has been dismissed because it's untreatable and she then went to the high ranking prosecutor H to reopen the case and the case was reopen and she was given a date uh to go for um uh to court and then when that date arrived she was she was told that the the docket is missing H she then went back home um and then she she I think she told she called about the matter and then them me to convey the matter to the pastor and on the same day she got a call H from the court saying that they have found the docket and they apologized for that and then the the the doet will now no longer be at the police station will now be at the court in the office of the high ranking magistrate or prosecutor

know me I'm pet I'm a Deon here at home God bless you and I'm happy to say my my friends here from amen amen possibly I'll be with them next week amen amen God bless you Saints let's go to uh the book of Ephesians i' like us to read chapter 3 uh let's read from the first the second verse to the ninth verse Ephesians 3 yeah from verse 2 to9 yes if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you what how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in few words whereby when he read he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow H and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ okay let's bow our heads and pray will you pray for us you have gathered Us in this place oh God because there is something that is Promised oh God [Music] go hallu am and amen you may be seated God bless you all amen amen okay my title is based in uh I think there's a verse here verse verse eight brother verse eight unto me who am less than the least of All Saints in this Grace GI is this Grace given that I shall preach among the Gentiles the unable Riches of Christ yeah that's the title The unsearchable Riches of Christ that's the title that I want us to Fellowship about uh these things I mean they they've got to do with the time that we we are living [Music] in uh we are living at the end time now when we say end time we uh referring to the end of the Gentile [Music] dispensation right and then while we we are talking about the end of the Gentile dispensation then there are some different dispensations let's take our Prophet brother Brenham just you were singing a song here it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of of the Lord and He will change the heart of uh the fathers to their children and their children to their fathers now that that's what we called different dispensation so our uh Prophet brother Brenham change the hearts of the children to their fathers it's it's it's a [Music] dispensation yeah it's a it's a commission that he should change the ministry his ministry was to change the heart of the children to their fathers and then what else thereafter now he he was given a new Commission of which now that new commission is the one now that causes a separation because now once you stick to changing their heart of the children to their [Music] fathers and stop there and then you've missed the Target because there's another one which is not written remember it's not in the book it's a new commission but not that new commission uh is what we call the third pool it's what we call the seventh SE they they just run concurrently they go on simultaneously it is the seventh seal which is the pool and then we've got the manifestations of the sons of God we've got the revelation of the son of man now these are different dispensations but they run simultaneously then if you miss them you miss the Target because after after I have turned the heart of the children to the fathers then then comes a new commission no the new commission is the thir pool and now that thir pool uh it's not for the public now if if it's not for the public which means it's hidden now how do we come to it how do we come to the understanding that's why now Paul speaks about the unable riches now I was checking this with unsearchable or let me start with mystery you go to the dictionary it says mystery it's something that is difficult or impossible to understand or to explain now it's a mystery it's for you right am then I check the word unchange I mean un then it means hidden something that cannot be understood by by searching you cannot search it until you find it now Paul says he preach the searchable riches something that is hidden is supposed to preach it now if you could check Paul he laid the foundation of chur of the church that was not all and thereafter he went into different mention see he said I know a man in thir heaven now now that's another Ministry after he laid the foundation took every he took the church and laid found position that everybody find his position in the church then from and if you can you can check Paul what he preaches to the Galatians and the Corinthians is not what he preaches to the Ephesians so that's why now we read the book of Ephesians where he speaks about the unable riches but then then we have a Ministry of the time that you are living in we cannot go back after the opening of the seven and go to the things we've got these hidden things that are for us which if you approach them with your human mind it it becomes a difficult thing that's why during the time of Paul they said now his messages are difficult why what makes it [Music] difficult because it doesn't need your mind it needs a revelation from God now once you try try to scratch your head and bringing a human understanding it will crush you because it it has got it its Channel it moves in that channel and then there's a throne of God in you now when God want to communicate with you goes to his throne and what what what he want to give you it must go according to that [Applause] chel it had nothing to do with your own [Applause] mind are we are we together now you've got your inheritance now our inheritance are in another dimension and in order to reach that inheritance we not we need to go through that Dimension are we together and then once we miss that Dimension it becomes a difficulty are we together uh let me give you an example there was a time when Prophet was with right amen they were looking at the same thing together both of them but they were seeing different things a Elisha saw the Chariots of Fire saw [Applause] angels saw Chariots of enemies are we together they're looking at one thing one see it From Another [Applause] Dimension the other one see it from another dimension are we together so now until Elisha said Lord open his eyes but his eyes were open he had his eyes open both of them they were their eyes were open but said Lord open his [Applause] eyes now we can all be sitting here hearing from the same preacher but hearing different [Applause] things because our inheritance are in a certain Dimension and when the preacher goes behind the ppit he preaches from a certain Dimension and then if you you are in that Dimension if you are not in that Dimension it preaches something that you are not in but if you are in that Dimension and then you will go together now here comes a question how does it come that now you'll be sitting here seeing things from different dimensions the ministry of the seven SE uh it has to do with our inheritance and with our theop it's an angel Angelic Ministry an Angelic Ministry we are crossing Dimensions look this the Bible says the angel of the Lord is encamping us now that that angel that is in camping us it's nothing else but the revealed word when he says when he say when the prophet says the word is now in the bright he start by saying here is the mystery you see it's a mystery the word is now in the bright now what is the we in the beginning was the we the word was with God the Word was God in other ways now God is in his throne that is why he says he who overcometh talking to us in thean church he that overcome see I will grant him to sit with me in my Throne now he is in his throne where in our hearts in which way in the form of the revealed way so when he says Lord open his eyes the prophet says God opened his seeing because his eyes were open see and then thereafter he was able to see the things that are in another dimension now the prophet says right now there are people among us that you cannot see they in another D at times it does happen that one screams here right and some Elders take him to pray for him and then when they pray for him they would say I've seen 1 2 3 4 how come we didn't see it okay last week or two weeks back I don't know somebody said you was calling me at home he was calling me at home he said no we had a stranger somebody that visited us he was sitting in front of me and that man stood up and came and pressed me on my shoulders so I said now where were the other people he said the other people were saying amen the preacher was preaching this man was pressing me and I know he's a visitor I don't know him now if I it wasn't myself I would say no you're mad out of your mind no she is right some people do that through other dimensions okay I'm I'm not on that now my my my my my sermon here it has to do with what people call difficult because of their approach to the they want to understand instead of having a revelation understanding has to do with a university book which you must read and understand and go and write your exams but the word of God goes hand in hand with a revelation and the Revelation has to do with the predestination right amen now predestination it's not your choice it's a process when God processed himself he process what was in his mind now the Bible says the very same Paul said we were in him before the foundation of the world now if we were in him how does Paul know that we were in him because he hasn't even met Jesus Christ physically he says we were in him before the foundation of the you see it came through Revelation I will show you amen uh there was a day in Luke uh uh 4 verse 21 I would like my brother to read it now these issues of crossing different dimensions it's not something that you could scratch your head and try to say how does you jump from one dimension to another now just verse 21 only verse 21 Luke 4: 21 and he began to say unto them this this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now here what happened is this Jesus was given a book he read a book and after reading a book that was uh he read where it it speaks about him actually he was expressing himself look our Lord Jesus Christ never said I am that son of Mary and Joseph of which you don't understand how how am I called the Son of God he never tried to explain those things because he knew that that was for a certain CL when when he called Peter he never tried to explain to Peter just called him and say come right amen now when he was reading about himself now people were trying to understand him they were LED people they know their scriptures so they they tried they tried to analyze him what's wrong with this young man so now he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your years you hear and you see it's a fulfillment of the scripture what what I've just read speaks about me but he never said like I'm doing just read it and unfold it the hearing the understanding the assumptions comes from them it was pulling of its own it's it's like the third pull it pulls of its own it has nothing to do with understanding no you were in his mind you were processed from his mind now if you are office it's you says my ship know my voice when he speaks there's something that pulls you are you together the other example that I can give you there were two of his disciples they were going to ous and they were talking about him now those were his disciples they slept with him they act with him they saw him raising T and lazaros they saw him walking upon the sea are we together they saw him multiplying the bread and [Music] fish but they were talking about him and he came and stood with them and said what are you talking about and then why did they say oh it is you so they saw a stranger now the only way that he can tell them who he was then they will change from the dimension that they are [Music] in he started quoting scriptures [Music] from Moses go and read it it says it was pulling them it says our hearts SP as I was see he was calling he was he was pulling of of of of I mean he was talking to to to those that are of him it's only the word that can attract them so he was he was pulling them by the way and then until they arrive at a m a mouse now to say to them I you satisfied that I him he took [Applause] bread when he took bread then they saw him now I'm talking about changing dimensions and then did he vanish it was not a [Music] ghost spoke right am so what happened to to these disciples then it was revealed unto them that he said we should meet in gilee then that thing pulled him to Gile he never said to them go to G no he just fokes about he just spoke about himself they had a revelation of what was his last way right amen so he appeared unto them in another form and revealed himself through the we remember our Lord Jesus Christ was here to manifest the we when the word says a virgin shall conceive he didn't say yes the Bible says the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son he didn't say I am that son no he manifested until they could see them you could see him by his manifestation because he start by uh first pool second pool or the third pool what I want to say that Peter said he went he said now our Lord Jesus Christ his soul went to hell and go and preach to the souls that repented not in the days of Noah it's written that's written by Peter where where was Peter when the soul of our Lord Jesus Christ went to hell Peter was fishing there after our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified Peter said oh he's gone he's gone I'm going for fishing for fishing but now he's the one that says his soul was in hell how did he know that because he was fishing now I'm trying to show you that it has nothing to do with your your your your human mind God came and revealed that to and Peter wrote It's like Moses he wrote the Book of Genesis says in the beginning God created heaven and before everything where was [Applause] Moses how did he know he never went to any school to go and whoever can write that must must get it from somebody else if they say somebody's a scholar he has read big books it's an information from somebody else he will get that information and create his own information see but yeah are unable riches it's when God himself visits you and expose himself are we together how did Peter know that Jesus went to preach to the souls in Hell how how did you know that okay let's let's continue now the the unsearchable riches it's it's something that is not written it's it's out of the book says the book was written within and without now what was without that is what we called the third pool that's what we call the the the the the seventh SE the Bible speaks right now right in your eyes and in your ears if you go to book of Romans chapter 8 verse 19 don't read it you know it it speaks about the it says the nature is grumbling the nature Waiting For What manifestations of the sons of God what is the manifestations of the sons of God it's when God manifest himself in his bright how does God manifest himself in his PR because God will be in a human being and doing his job in a human being what is that how does he manifest himself okay we talk about and then we we we talk about the revelation of the son of man now he came to the Jews as a son of men God in a man he came to the Gentiles as the Son of God the Holy Ghost is it right and then after he has done the job of the Holy Ghost then he came as a son of man still to the Gentiles that is why now the time that you are living in he he is the son of man he is the revealed way what is he doing can we see what is he doing as as as the son of man yes we we're talking about the seventh seal we're talking about the third pool but now they should be you know our Lord Jesus Christ was uh manifesting the weight and then when he was manifesting the we they said to him H you should have a witness that's somebody that can say yes this is the son of God and then prove it I I prove then he said no I bear a record of myself you hear what he says I bear record of myself because now who was talking then or who was speaking by then it was Christ and who is Christ Christ was not created and Christ was not born Christ is the Son of God Christ is the logos Christ is the word so the word bear record of [Applause] himself that is the Son of God the pillar of fire the W Christ himself I bear record of myself who else can because I'm the first and the last I'm Alpha and I'm Omega who can says he knows me better I bear record of myself now when you talk about the third pool is when you bear record of yourself there's nobody that knows you because you processed from [Applause] go you'll bear record of yourself because worldly people cannot understand you because they they approach you with Earthly understanding meanwhile you have a divine nature are we together now having a divine nature having we are having a supernatural understanding that's what we call now another body now Paul speaks about body terrestrial and body [Music] Celestial 1 Corinthians chapter 15 that's I don't read it you know it yeah you know it body Terr and body where did he get that how does we know that we've got a physical body here and after we die we get another body and then in heaven we've got a glorified you see it's the process it comes from eternity okay I'll read you what the Bible I mean the prophet says okay he says here speaking with brother brother Brenham says here in this book what is a vision he said you see the first pool it's when you use to put your hands on the people and tell them what's their trouble I'm reading paragraph 98 then the second pool was when we know the secrets of their heart like I told you right then he goes on God now brother Bram is speaking to God now says God now if somebody says he speaking to God so if I'm speaking to Brother P here he's here I'm here now if somebody says God spoke to me you must know that that person is a great person before God now now this Prophet you will see that now him and God were friends God will speak to him what he says uh the second pull was when you know the secrets of the heart like I told you and said instead of keeping instead of you keeping that to yourself it's called now speaking to brother br say instead of you keeping these things to yourself you try to explain all about it that's God telling brother and tell people now he's saying to the prophet you shouldn't have told people and this man is supposed to preach and tell people so that people could believe that and then from down they must believe God now why does God say you shouldn't have told [Applause] them and when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself that's called now rebuking brother amen and how could you explain it because you got it from me you don't know anything about it now how would you explain my thing and yet is a prophet behold I sent you Elijah the prophet right he must turn our hearts and you've cost a big bunch of caral impers [Music] to rise up and you see what you've done no that is God saying to his Prophet look now you made a mess right and then he said Lord I'm sorry where did they meet when they were they were communicating about this was he sitting somewhere and then they had this [Music] [Applause] communication right amen and he said I'm sorry I don't know what to do then it goes on in this book says is this the time the time I think it's paragraph 392 392 then he said says you remember the third pool you remember what happened I tried to explain it he said don't do that things are happening you get excited say okay let me tell the church then he says don't do that why why did he he showed him this things I will I'll show you says don't do that and then with a second P says don't try and I pulled anyhow you all remember then he continues and then he said now there's a third pool coming but don't try to explain now you can get confused with now he's giving me that said I must not explaining and people are going to ask me questions then I then you see now I approach this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusion right amen now with this be the mystery that will open up that will bring Christ bring a power to the church so now is this the sign that's what that's what that's where I was reading now let's go back now to Paul we read the first verse we explain what are the riches the riches is the inheritance your inheritance is when you are reinstated to your place where you come from have you ever read uh The Book of John chapter 6 that one you can read chapter 6 verse 62 John 6 verse 62 now your your your inheritance is in another dimension and then your your riches are the inheritance you got it my brother Sir John 6:62 what and if he shall see the son of man as sent up where he was before where he was before that's that's what Christ said said what and if he shall see the son of man as send went up where he was before where was he before where was the son of man before because the son of man was Christ then what does Christ come from now if you could say Christ is the second person he will be leaving his father in Heaven the very same Christ that descended is the very same one that will go back where you was now with a human mind thing Heaven is a certain place where where go when God left that place it remains empty or with body guards until he comes back now God is omnipresent we are here now we are here now God is in Elizabeth God is with the p God is with with brother Reed where he is with all the brothers so his omn presentent now he says what and if you see the son of man Ascend and go back where you are now your inheritance is when you go back where you come from we together and then where you come from and where you are right now with the I was asking you where did Moses get this where did Peter get this where did Paul get this they get it from their place they ascended supernaturally and and find and find their inheritance and then they were in a place where they will know everything are we together where God reveals everything it was when Moses says in the beginning then he had to go to the beginning and see the beginning where he was with God when he was creating when he says in the beginning God created heaven and earth then he was there and in the Book of John when the Bible says in the beginning was the way then he himself have to be the way in order to write about the way and then he he has to be in that beginning and bring forth that thing now Paul says here you hear what is saying okay fine let's go to verse two then Ephesians chapter 3 we are talking about the unable the hidden that cannot be understood by searching you cannot understand because you searched it is beyond your understanding if you have verse two it says if you have heard of the dispensation of Grace dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you what so in other words God gave him the dispensation of Grace he says now I have received this dispensation because of you that's why it's you it's another English here King James Vision it says giv me to you what which means now uh giving me because of [Music] you now God didn't give you he gave me because of you [Applause] right amen then the second the third verse how that by Revelation he made known unto [Music] me he made known unto me by Revelation the mystery what is a mystery something that is difficult or impossible to understand or to explain now he says he gave me my Revelation amen verse verse three how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery and if you have your your Bibles there it is I could see it it has a close amen what do you call that brackets then from the one let's read between the says as I WR in few words and it goes to to to verse four the the bracket is still still s whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ I am given the Revelation and with my Revelation I write unto you so that you could understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ now God gave it to Paul and Paul gave it to the church that is why in the conduct order doctr uh we will have the sequence of positions whereby God does not take a shortcut and come he'll give it to the prophet for a purpose and the Prophet The Prophet will give it to the pastor and the pastor will give it to you but now when I say give it to you I'm talking about the revelation God will reveal it to the prophet let's go to the seven seal it says the revelation of the seven seal the revelation of the now the seventh seal is revealed to the prophet right amen and the prophet revealed the seventh SE and the pastor took the seven SE and clarified until it is revealed to us what does it do he he he just teaches and when it teaches there is a spirit that brings an understanding in you because this thing is a revelation it goes with that sequence it's revealed to brother BR it's revealed to the pastor it's revealed to the church are we together now individually you catch it by revelation now where is your where is your inheritance your the inheritance when it is revealed unto you because it takes you back to your position it ascends you to your position where you are that's where your Revelation is you hear what he says verse four when you read you may understand my knowledge Paul says when you read you understand his knowledge in the mystery of Christ it's a mystery then Paul says when you read what I'm telling you what I've written to you then you understand right amen amen there was a part oh there is a part in the SCP in the book of Acts let's read it the book of Acts chapter 13 acts 13 verse 47 verse 47 what I'm trying to bring forth Believers is that there's nothing uh heart and there's nothing that you cannot understand unless you you you do away with your understanding with with your mental understanding look I'm coming to that one what are we waiting here we are waiting for the changing of our body what what is the rapture the Rapture is when our body changes right now what is going to change your body and how is your body going to [Music] change right what does the Bible says it speaks about the the second Adam it says it's a quickening spirit says the second Adam is a quickening spirit that weight that is in you it germinates it forms another supernatural being the word of God is in your heart when is your heart it formed a supernatural being that supernatural being is called a theop it's your body it's your Supernatural and the prophet says that body is subject to the way it forms a man right it's a supernatural being right am now the quickening spirit it's when that body takes over it's like you were born you were born somewhere by your mother and father when you receive the word of God you you you get another nature which is divine now Paul speaks about the two Natures in a man fighting when you want to do this the other nature says do this until you surrender to the divine nature how does the divine nature come into you Romans chapter 16 16 it says your spirit and the spirit of God come to a point where they agree now what is the agreement of the two Spirits uh it does not say now the spirit of God surrender to your spirit [Music] it changes your spirit and then once it changes your spirit and then you start feeding from [Music] God and when you start feeding from we say you grow spiritually then it forms another body that is why he said take he says take this this bre it's my flesh that's why he said I am the bridge that comes from Heaven says eat this it's my body flesh is the weight you eat the word of God are we together that's why we are here because there's something that us there's something that when we come to the service we eat the way but now it's not a matter of feeding you but the interpretation of what has been said it comes from the spirit itself I don't want to read that scripture I read it in I'll quote it first it's it's it's it's Ephesians 1:1 17 it says God will give you a spirit right am and then that spirit will bring will give you knowledge and understanding in other words you cannot understand the word of God all by yourself there's a certain spirit that have to interpret what you have read like now people they say this thing is too difficult but there is a spirit that needs to explain to you what and then by explaining to you then that is the growth of what we call the inner until you reach the St of a perfect [Applause] man and then when you reach the St of a perfect man then you see your inheritance you know Caleb was shown as a place say Moses said that is your place in the Promised Land he kept that within himself he never left that thing when he crossed over knew where his place are when you cross over when you cross over you should know where you place when they said the word is now in the bright place you that is placing you let you know where your place is you are not going to scratch your head you already have the Revelation the seventh seed is the one that pleases you the power of the third is the one that makes you to overcome are we together all right let's continue uh I ask scripture or sorry before you could read that let's connect it Paul says as I write a four I'm reading I'm going back to verse three as I wrote a four in few words whereby when you read you may you may understand my knowledge in the Myster of Christ right amen Now read now that uh scripture in the book of Acts 13:47 for so have the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the end of the Earth yeah now you you should go and read the whole Acts chapter chapter 13 the old it's when now Paul was changing his ministry so the Min like like brother Brenham when the ministry changes becomes the ministry of an Angel remember he went westwards he met the seventh angel he met the notable one then after he met the the ministry changed it was a new Commission now it's the ministry of the angel now that angel communicate with your angel are we together because after he met that angel then there was no uh spoon [Music] feeding he was not spoon feeding he came look he preached from the first seal up to the Sixth Seal when it comes to the seven SE when it comes to the seven are we together now Paul was a a [Music] Jew okay let me leave that one our Lord Jesus Christ went to the first pool second pool the third pool and after the revelation after he said after Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God then he said tell no one why you know he took them to M Transfiguration and they saw him being transfigured and then he said tell no one there was a blind man he took him out of the city and prayed for him and he received his side then he said tell why is tell instead of running to the seat and say I can see now says tell no he was because these are Supernatural thing if you if you right now if one of you can go to heaven and and meet God and SP speak with God and come back and say I I visited God we're going to take him to like like I was reading here that brother was communic with God God was rebuking me don't do this don't do this what did the Pentecostal say now he's sick this actually after his death God killed him he was angry now our Lord Jesus Christ uh he did all those good things now when he says I and my father are one the problem started there now what is that it is because now changing Dimensions it it must God himself it must be God that reveals himself to them that's why he says tell no one he said Peter flesh and blood did not reveal that you now wait let the other people also get the Revelation now when they saw him on trans transfig they themselves were convinced that this man he not an ordinary man now wait until it is revealed to those people at the right time they themselves would say it like the Samaritan woman saw and then after I saw him the other people came and see and see him for themselves and then what did they say that's yes we've heard what but now we are seeing it for ourselves now each and everyone it must be [Applause] revealed it's not a a teaching or a preaching it has to be revealed brother Bram says I lay out I lay out I preach and preach and saw you must take what I've preached go and pray go and go and pray and then God will reveal it when when when you read the the seventh se you can read from the first up to the sixth when you reach the seven you will feel that now then you will say this is my Revelation then you will sit back and say yeah now I want to see his R then you'll end up saying it's mine it ends up there it say it's my Revelation are together that is why now some other people say it's not revealed and then what is it because he says it's my Revelation and then when okay let's continue right we were reading uh about Paul uh crossing over to the uh Gentiles we spoke about our Lord Jesus Christ after uh Peter had a revelation he became the target you see until he said to our Lord because he said after that the ministry changed after Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God the ministry changed amen and then when the ministry Chang it becomes something unable something that you cannot understand he says I'm going to be arrested I'll be uh crucified and I will rise on the third page now they start that's crashing their crashing their now Peter said you arrested Over My Dead Bo and then he called him aside and said that will never happen now I said Peter after the Revelation he became the target then what did God say I mean what did Christ say he said get the behind me you Satan devil now you were saying that to because he saw the devil in Peter he was casting out the devil you remember he said to Peter Peter the devil want to sift you like the bride the devil want to sift the bride but what did he say to Peter I have prayed for you you see now a predestinated person you cannot change his journey if the prophet says the word is in the bright there's no way in which you can divert look you can say what you want to no there was a time where where Christ said uh if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood are not worthy the others turn their back and Peter remain then he said no what about you people then Peter said where shall we go why because etal life are with you now if you read John don't read it I'm quote it John 663 joh 663 it says flesh profited nothing the spirit that profited now it's the words that I speak they are life and they Spirit the words that he speaks they are a life oh it is the spirit that Quicken it the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak un to you they are spirit and they are [Applause] life those are the words that builds life unto you those are the words that bring life unto you so what I want to show you that towards the end there's lot of commission because the I mean the lot of commotion because there comes a new commission which is not [Music] written so you going to search it with a scripture you won't find it it's to you because God gave it to Adam and the devil nearly took it that is why there was silence in heaven it must be something that will go directly to you because I gave you the first pool the second po the devil took it and diverted it that is why that is why there's so lot of healing sessions are we together let's continue amen amen now we were in verse four let's go to verse 5 he says let's let's connect it first whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it now revealed into His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit revealed unto the Holy Apostles Prophets by the spirit verse eight verse unto me who am less than the least of All Saints this Grace given I mean the I mean is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles they un searchable riches when min changed become the unable riches then he continues and says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery by the way we said what was the mystery something that is difficult or impossible to understand to explain but Paul says ver what you call uh uh verse n and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery fellowshipping in the mystery that is the seven it's it's it's a hidden that the bride fellow the bride Fellowship on the hidden on something that people say is difficult or impossible to understand or to explain we don't have to understand it it needs to be revealed so the Fellowship on those things he says which from the beginning of the world it had been hid in God something that was hidden in God himself that's what you fellowshipping about it was only God that knows that and when he went to fellowship with you he makes you a god are we together so that now we should could fellowship with the fellow God it's in the same [Music] stream have you heard what it says it says and to make men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world been hid in God who created All Things by who by Jesus Christ God created All Things by Jesus Christ who is Jesus now God himself came down here's another one he says the third pool uh it will never fail but before we go to that one I'm checking my time here I I want you I want to read this thing with you so that when I close I must not miss it the the prophet speaks about the angel of the Lord uh and he speaks about the angeling being and he speaks about the angel uh in the book of uh Revelation chapter 22 can you can you uh open it my brother I want us to to go on that one and then we should close before we go to that one let's read uh this this uh quote here why are people so toast about why are people so toast about yeah it says here therefore Angelic beings are ordained ministers of God you understand Angelic beings which means they being you know what they being b e i n g therefore Angelic beings are ordained ministers of God [Music] to come to the Earth to Bear record of God they are ordained to come to the Earth to Bear record and they work through mortal beings just as they did to Daniel back through the ages and I believe it with all my heart that Angelic beings Ministers of God then paragraph 13 says and so therefore and so therefore friends as your brother that all I [Music] am but God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel God's gift came down in the form of now he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walk just as that walk on the floor walk right over just as normal as any man and talk just like any man he comes time after time through the room and different places when I'm fasting and praying right amen let's continue reading Revelation 1 ver one verse one Revelation 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass yes and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John now it says Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ remember we say Christ was processed from God it's God it's God himself when he takes another platform and is Christ so the revelation of Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass now he send an angel he sent an angel to signify to John amen now John in order to be aware that that this comes from God there must be an angel that is send that's why the Bible says here he sends right amen and signify by his Angel unto his s right verse two verse two who bear record of the word of God now they said to our Lord Jesus Christ you bear record of yourself now in Israel whenever you come with your story they want to hear they want to see an angel bearing a record there should be a sign that you come from when when our Lord Jesus Christ says I come from God and I go back to God they say now bear a record you see now when God uh in the Book of Revelation John saw these things the Book of Revelation and then there was an angel that came and bear record it's like when uh you you speak about the seven seal or the thir pool an angel that bear record when you speak about third pool angel must bear record let me give you an [Music] example uh the manifestations of the sons of God what do they manifest they manifest the things that that were taken out of a man man was a king here on Earth are we together then men I mean men should be retained or restored back to his position and manifest what he used to manifest in the Garden of Eden uh Adam Adam was manifesting things was calling things into now it's brother says the third pool is to the lost [Music] soul that is why our Lord Jesus Christ had the first one making Miracles the second one rebuking the Pharisees and Jesus the third one he went to hell to preach to the souls and the third PO is to do the same [Music] thing now how do we preach to the souls that repented not now listen carefully how do we the bride preach to the Souls that repent that is why there's this issue of the underworld what what is in the in the Underworld the souls that repented not look he said I will build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against which means there's a gate from hell they Prevail I mean they ascend to the Earth together through those Gates what are those Gates those Gates they come through the rituals that they [Music] do when they make rituals they open up the gate they call the souls that never rep repented and they are in contact with those Souls now it's only the fat pool that can close that are we together you go out right now to any River you will find them making rituals rituals they make rituals what is the ritual the ritual will communicate with the Unseen with a spirit that is in hell and come in a certain form are are we together and communicate and come are we together and from there on they mobilize to fight people they come to the people and incarnate themselves into people are we together they come from hand and then you the bride you are the only one that could close that and and and what does the prophet say the prophet says there are those people that God hears when they pray what God hears them when they pray God hears them what makes them what makes God to hear them because they are in line with the word of [Applause] God are we together they are relevant with the word of God look if God says go south and you go north then God cannot follow you he follows the one that goes to the because he is relevant with he do what God says he should do at the right time are we together now God hears you because you are relevant with his words you do what he says you should do look our Lord Jesus Christ said to his disciples let's go and meet in Galilee they didn't go to galile he was not happy about he could not expose himself because he said they must go to G From Galilee is's going to give them a commission are we together but he will he he will prove himself there will be uh they were hiding he just came in and said peace be with you without any door opening you see and he say Thomas look look here come come because you don't believe he was proving himself but thaty want to do that that side and then from there he gave them a commission go and wait and the Holy Spirit will come and therea he start by saying in John 6 he says there's lot of things that I can tell you you will never understand he was with them but when he comes he will tell you all things now if you don't go and wait you won't know all things and if you don't follow the ministry of the time that you are living in after together so now there's a Ministry that is powerful but it's hidden from the wise and prudent and is revealed unto you the [Applause] babies all right I'm closing let me finish up here am I was reading uh paragraph 13 and so therefore friends as your brother okay I've read that one let oh I was reading Revelation chapter 1 verse 2 amen and then we said now he he he who bear record of the word let's let's let's join it with one let's what in the first verse said the revelation of Jesus Christ which which God gave unto him right God gave it unto Jesus Christ don't make them to you he he he called himself take another dispensation and became a son that's why it says the revelation of Jesus Christ God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he send and signified by his angel s John don't forget that he send and signified by his Angel who is that angel right amen he send and signify by his Angel unto John John hear what that angel says because God signified by that angel John is listening to what that angel says right amen uh verse two verse two who bear record of the word of God that angel bear record and signify John doesn't know anything we hear from that angel and also the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw there's an angel that signify praise God verse three ver it says blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of his prophecy and keep those things which are written there for time is at hand let's go to Revelation chapter 20 that's that will be my last okay 22 verse 6 226 mhm and he said unto me this saying that angel that angel said unto me to me who and he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done verse seven behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book eight and I John saw this things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things 20 n i mean I mean nine then say he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book God Amen now in closing uh we started by reading about uh the Angelic [Music] beings and and the process in which they they they descend the Bible says unto the angel of the church Church of Ephesus to the angel to the angel until it comes to the aition and says unto the angel of the Church of laisha so you see brother was an angel and then and then then when brother Brenham was an angel there was a time now that he went Westward and met an angel which is the notable one then that changed the ministry and then when that changed the ministry was the one now that came and explained everything in the Book of Revelation there is no Prophet that could explain the Book of from Revelation chapter one up to re the last chapter 22 he was bearing record of of all things that is the man that was explaining to John and John wanted to write said no don't write but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to write the mystery the mystery so that angel is your angel is your brother that's why he start by explaining the different Angels but you will never say that angel was me but you go and read between the line who explained to join all these things may the Lord bless you God bless you thank you may the Lord bless you all amen God bless you Saints can we clap hands for the Lord I will ask just to come forth to say a word of prayer then we will hand over to the worship team I believe brother Tois have something special to sing for us while they are preparing for the baptism as we bow our head our Eternal Heavenly Father amen We Just Want to Thank You Lord that these Mysteries father they are
