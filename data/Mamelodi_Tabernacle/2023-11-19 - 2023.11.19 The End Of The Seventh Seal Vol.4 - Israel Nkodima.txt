Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol.4
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-November 19 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 8:1 Isaiah 11: 6-9 Galatians 3:16
The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The End of The Seventh Seal.
John was lifted up from the seven church ages to be able to see things to come. For you to see further, God must put you in a higher position to be able to see.
The bride is not the churches, but they were taken out of the churches. The real message came from within the constellation. The ministry at the end was not church ages but was the constellation where the prophet was put inside the pyramid of angels.
The Seventh Seal is not coming through a preaching, but it is opened to us. A true preacher does not impersonate he wait to get the message from God.
It is the attributes that can hear what God spoke back then, and these attributes today they are manifested and they are people. The message that is spoken to the attributes is from before the foundation of the world. 
The word that you have received is the blood. The word that is spoken from the seed, it becomes a seed. To be born again is when you are a seed. 
The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

61-0730E The Sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel Par 132
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 78
60-1206 The Smyrnean church age Par  120

up and I'm looking at the the invisible Union invisible when the brother started to communicate with us the brothers from far away then I said this is the invisible Union of the Bride so invisible and I said this is the end of the seventh seon do you say it is not revealed if it is not revealed we'll come and look at it then Satan will be ruling forever but if it is revealed and brother bam says it is the end of that se but today I I have something from brother memes after this we are still going to continue with the end of the seven the bride is now not uh waiting for the revelation will will

you must put your house in order and all that I'm that's why I'm looking for a file it is here yes go God bless you brother amen amen amen all right we are going to read the scripture and my brother uh spoke to me now I promise even in my heart that I will read it this to the church the Lord willing we still continue with the end of the I am not waiting for the revelation of the seventh SE the seventh se he didn't say it will be preached he said it is open amen now if it is open it's some it is not preached where every person can say I also heard it is this you'll realize when we come with it next time that it is not something to preach but the the Bible says when he opened not when he preached amen amen because um when he opened when he opened and I what happened when he opened let's read brother and uh before we read we have our Elder here our Elder to just say a word of prayer to our most holy God we are here this morning amen let us pray gracious Lord before we read the scripture we Commit This Moment unto that's right a moment father where your presence is now in we used to say amen Israelites were in the Old Testament you were far in the clouds Lord Almighty they will see a pillar of fire and they will see a cloud amen and you came into the temple in Jerusalem they could not go into the holy of holies but father when the seals were opened father you came into the into our hearts yes and come Lord Almighty and S with us now Lord Almighty you are the one that is doing everything in the olden days it used to be the angel of the Lord uh encountering and doing everything but that angel now Lord Almighty is a an amature God gracious Lord even this very morning Lord we pray as the pastor stands here yes let anoint him Lord Almighty Inspire Him Father with that very same anointing brother Bram head when the Angels came and picked him up there's an angel that flew into him father then that angel commune with him and that very same Angel is the one that will commune with your servants today and it will commune with us the bride take control father of the situation that is the very thing that the devil doesn't want the devil doesn't want to see the bride seeing what he is because that makes him an amateure so then that devil will bind him with a mighty name Lord because it's a Divine name he has no power that is why he comes in different forms but rather he's too late because C the seals and the thir pool has been revealed Lord father thank you we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen all right you may be seated God bless you can read oh sir God bless you sir amen Revelation chapter 8 verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated I just wanted that part when he op you don't find in the Bible where the seventh seal was preached but we find only where he opened amen amen I think it's something you are looking at you remember how he said to John come up and I will show you things to come meaning John could not see those things he could only see them after was summoned up then brother B puts it puts it in this way that he says from there he was lifted from the church ages chur amen meaning he left this church at the end of the church AG Church in that Vision John was someone to come up in order to see beyond the church ages supposed to come up it is like that in the Bible for you to see further God has to put you in a position so that you can see now our vision it's not just to look at one thing like this no our because it is in a cycle of Eternity like when brother one day said us go the of amen amen and that's why we are going to see that today it is beyond our preaching season when brother bam met the seventh angel so it changed to something else now you must remember we are talking about the seven Church ages Church seven Church ages amen amen but you don't have the rest of this is we are only in the seventh where is the other part in the sixth Dimension they Beyond in the sixth Dimension but every time we hear preaching the seven Church ages Church yes part of it is is not visible is that right amen and now because is the time now for the bride which it is the part that is invisible to some people another thing let me say um the bride is not churches brother says the has been taken out of the churches amen that's why in your Bible Overcomers there is those who are are called each and every Church age Church age H it it had two twis twins twins then you can hear as you you you you go down reading it says uh in every Church age it has what it's called Overcomers each Church age I think we went through that out of each Church age you have their Overcomers amen chosen out of each Church age have you seen that and now the bride is not several different churches is the [Music] bright right amen if you were to bring churches together you get the differences are you going to call that the bread no you can have a bright differences yes amen you can't have this type of the Bride and this type of the that type of the no you have the briad is the bread of Christ that's why Christ made sure that at the end of time he introduced his wife he he's not a polygamous not wives but he has to introduce the wife so you are going to see when we go back to this the seventh seal it brings the white stone interpretation because uh the real real message came from within the constellation the seven se you know when it started then the prophet of God at first he went West now in the Bible it it says uh the Garden of Eden you know there was Eden the headquarters of God the garden of Ed the headquarters of son [Music] you amen ask brother will now Eden was that's why he says the angel took me to the West yes the garden the garden man was placed Eastward and you watch him like last we read something here I can just read that part for now then we'll come back to finish at this part all right amen because we still have one thing in our spiritual mind we have the three and a half years of the Lord Jesus Christ and the 3 and a half years of Lucifer Lucifer I read it you amen is the prophet saying that 3 and a half years and 3 and a half years where we are now H we are have done past the three and half years that was of the prophecy of Christ he says the prophet brother and a half amen am I right yes is that right Jesus Christ Jesus Christ prophesied for how long now and he says now there is 3 and a half years of Satan named called right amen now the bride is now looking with uh another I because the world now is entering the 3 and a half years of Lucifer what a terrible thing have you ever seen the world without the Lord [Music] Jesus you still can smile go to shop and do things because the Rapture has not yet taken but it will take the Rapture will go very very very I don't know which day but it's going according to the signs that we have seen uh what do they call this events now how do they interpret the events that are like what we see water earthquake rains and so [Applause] forth and they call it disasters natural disasters yeah but they call it okay leave there the Bible according to the Bible they as the Lord Jesus a question about this time and he said oh hey Brethren as it was in the days of what wasat then if you take the book Seven Church ages seven Church ages it tells you about thean church age church that the Lan church that was theia was a place of floods earthquakes get your book read and then it will tell you that this church age okay now H I'm going to finish just now now we see that the world now has gone that far as the prophet says this laition condition is just like that of the time of Noah but you know I was blessed that God spoke to Abraham the seed you read will come to that that the Bible says we are the Seed of Abraham you know seed in every field where city is planted there will be also the weeds all right amen then in that Garden some are not some of the uh seats there are not predestinated but among all that's coming up [Music] when there is a seat that is predestinated a brother ask a question why brother is quiet while the people are talking B about you I said why the Lord Jesus quiet who's this one who stood before him accusing him are you the king of the Jews the Bible says the [Applause] Jesus that's the nature of the seed amen amen he didn't he knows that this they don't hear him they will never hear him it's another seat amen so the Bible say he quiet I think I another Soldier smacked him how can you be quiet can't you hear what you being asked the Lord Jesus knew that to answer this person is just as if I'm talking to nothing amen he knew himself to be Jesus amen amen and he knew that the accusation was coming from Satan the people who came before him chos him just vels used by [Applause] Satan so that's why he kept because you answer them you don't answer them he let he let it flow like that amen amen now I said you remember I said I'm not ready for with anybody no I'll just carry on to preach the gospel of the master okay amen now that's why when I come here I don't prepare to answer some people I prepare to preach the gospel that's all God want me to preach the gospel he will take care of the amen leave it in the hands of Jesus Christ don't answer them don't argue if you are AED you don't argue because you know that is the devil now let's look at this H you know where is the part of my brother here there's a place this part here good afternoon my brother bless tell brother that I am looking forward to the service that was last week for the ending of the seventh [Music] SE and I said that is the invisible Union okay amen and they says and the opening of a new day now for this part I went to check the sixfold purpose of Daniel purp of Daniel 76 76 and I think I borrowed one last week from somebody you are free to come in after service yes sir amen page6 76 amen paragraph 132 paragraph 132 it anwers the question Isaiah 11 11 chapter 6 to9 verse 6 to9 and the brother has put this and now let's read read for us Isaiah 11 yes from verse 6 to 9 amen the wolf also shall dwell with the lamp and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the Cal and the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sing child shall play on the hole of the ASP and the wind child shall put his hand on the T then they shall not Hur nor destroy in all my holy land holy mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea amen okay amen uh this is what the brother was looking at and if you read this page 766 132 uh paragraph 132 paragraph 132 amen what it says brother Jack right back here and Isaiah speaking again at the 11th chapter the first verse to the 9th listen what he says here again what he is catches the vision after he sees the women the way they'll be acting in the last day now Isaiah 11:1 should I continue yes I wonder where it speaks of the answering the question here the lamp shall lie down with the lion more or the wolf okay and it shall come to pass before they call I will answer that glorious anointing in behind the chabs I'll answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall Feit together the lion shall eat thr like the bulock the dust shall be the Serpent's meat and they shall not H nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain said the Lord can you miss it no okay amen we are going to go down that until we arrive now if I take you back to the church ages not not I'm talking about what we we we we we touch it last week you know as we are going to see the interpretation of the white stone you see you see where brother B says the dream of our brother there who brother Jackson junior Jackson brother interpreted to the brother the dream he had about the pyramid now did you notice that since ever H we've been talking about the pyramid because the man responsible for the pyramid was the [Music] seven amen okay amen and uh I don't have the book but we are coming with that where the Prophet says pyramid pyramid Enoch Enoch the seventh man from Adam he came with this sign the pyramid seven steps to the king inside Pam and is it is taking us to the last pyramid of angels where we'll come with godage where the prophet of God says they put him in that pyramid of themselves and the white stone was within the pyramid so the ministry at the end was not the church ages church but was the constellation and the prophet was put within that constellation then he says when the Angels Came they put them him into the Pyramid of themselves so the the mystery now like the time of Enoch that was it was a pyramid and this is the seventh Church age amen mhm amen we need the prophet of the seven now that one was the seventh from Adam this one is the seventh angel Messer from Paul because you must count seven amen amen amen seven super then we'll come to that the white St because he started to talk about the interpretation the flying one time of the Angels you get what I mean amen now that's why uh you don't have you've never heard somebody preaching the seventh seal because he never said he will preach he open now to open is not to [Applause] preach now if the people are waiting for the preaching from the pul pit and they said yeah yeah now I've got it no it's not coming that way it is open revealed if God says I will open unto you this and that he doesn't say I will preach amen amen I can prove to you that the world is full of preachers even the new ones are coming up but those are imitators preaching over but what what is coming up now talks about impersonation yeah impersonation he says it I take the notes then afterwards I say last night God spoke to me Hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but the thing was preached by the brother now instead of saying I was blessed when brother preached that this Angel would know God spoke to me like if I come here I don't come here to be SE my brothers they know uh even last night I didn't sleep I slept the time I [Music] jump um my bedday was this morning this morning what was the time now I think pass three yes that's when I went just to take a nap because I'm not uh impersonating no I that wait upon the Lord a true preacher doesn't person he look he finds it from God Amen I love Moses when he said Lord if you don't go with us leave us here firstly he said these people are yours amen he knew that he has no message for the people these are the people of God I think every preacher should learn that that you are preaching to the children of God and it is God who knows what to say to his that's why brother impation [Music] kills you just say something after somebody and you say say pray this morning you know God spoke to me Hallelujah why don't you say I was blessed when brother preached so it's a stolen Minister you are guilty all right amen now before we close because we are still coming with the stone we are going to go into the pyramid because that's where the thing is can I read you something um where oh let me find it quickly amen uh because this message we have read last time that it's not from 19 it's way back the seven seal where when did it start let me find you this place where did he start brother way back where's my page here this seven SE all the way back from genisis or Genesis what do you say Genesis you agree with the bread doubt some all the way back this seven seal is spoken of that is Page 483 of s spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis the seven amen you see where it is coming from amen spoken of from that's why if you can see this the message here at the end is not H by any person because already it was spoken of back now this is the time of the attributes because it is the attributes uh who can she something that God spoke there attribute was in his mind and today there are people but the message coming to the attributes was not started was not spoken of from 19 before the foundation of the world believe the prophet of God he says you were in his mind before the foundation of the world when he started to open the MTH there were some amens from the and those attributes are me now amen that's why praise God they can hear the gospel that was never preached any age but they have heard him when they were attributes now brother bam says these attributes at the end time they will do exactly like you know the Bible says of the Seed of Abraham did you read in Galatians it says we have Isaac but it says you are the Seed of Abraham but have you realized you read where it said Jesus is this Christ is the Seed of Abraham amen [Music] amen who has seen that Brothers there Elder how are you Seed of Abraham it sayses Christ also it says you are the Seed of Abraham Christ is the Seed of Abraham amen what does that mean do you have it brother in your book yes I think Galatians 3 amen verse 16 now to Abraham and his seat where the promise is made yes he Seth not and to seeds as of many amen but as of one and to thy seat which is Christ right to thy seat which is that's why brother you are born again because you are a seed then I read C where it says God gave bir to it's how he puts it God gave bir to hisself then he become become as Jesus amen because we don't have the mother of God Amen even Jesus he was the seed that came to Mary now the word of God says when Gabriel came to Mary actually he was bringing the seed the seed is the word that he spoke and when Mary believed and said be it unto me could into your then the seat started to materialize the word in Mary the real real message you know there's something in this book can I check it amen all right I check it while I'm looking at the time there um let me take you back to this and the blood test blood test shows whether you go are of God or not I will remember to bring that book with me in the book of seals it speaks of the word being the blood and when he came to Mary to bring the way now the prophet puts it this way the way of the Bride says that word in Mary materialized and became blood so if you it says you are saved of the blood the word that you have received is the blood but we are talking about the real way just amen amen the word spoken from a seed becomes a seed [Applause] am amen amen if that word you have received is not a SE where are you going no life because life comes from the Sea by the SE to be born again it's when you are Ace to begin with he understand this word born again is not referring to everybody is to AED that should come back again if you are arguing I'll read it for you okay now listen the blood test shows whether you are of God or not now this blood test is not the done through an injection no it is the word now Christ also being the [Music] seed now this seed when it was born it became a a man human form right amen then he speaks to you the word amen don't you don't try to hear the word from me amen no amen pray and say Lord I'm going to the service speak to [Applause] me and God will speak to you through his servant and another mystery if it is God speaking to a predestinated seity that person receives it as the word of God that's why he cannot impersonate because he has received the word of God which is the blood amen we are going to go to get into the test we'll bring this flying interpretation and these other things the con in the conation when the prophet said remain here look inside inside amen amen and the and it says while they were looking inside he started to walk away now it tells me that the others started to leave because Revelation 7 when it open do you see anything it was silence but you must say silence in heaven silence you say silence or silent I don't silence amen amen in heaven and not [Music] on I hear people say it was silent say it was silent in heaven amen because here on there was a messenger [Music] amen who came when it was silent in heaven something here was amen and then because it was not meant to be you can't go to heaven to preach now I'm closing with this blood test shows whether you're of God you know I was looking at something I'll come with that something because the Bible says when he shall appear we shall be [Music] okay amen you know the reason is you have some people here but we we'll come with those things if maybe I happen to see myself and a young person inst instram or W you never know but things like that now if you find me there pH me immediately because the Bible says when he shall appear amen amen what I we all want to be like him I want to see myself in him after I was born never said to me you get yourself or let the people see you I don't want to I want to be SE of God that's all now after you see me being a person what will happen what is that for I'll come and read you those things the people shall be the lovers lovers [Music] of state of seeing Jesus if state of a desire to see Jesus you have the desire to see yourself thank you for yes say all right amen every time you know even when maybe it's night time I'm sleeping I just say to God I want to see you the people who were in his mind amen they are working now they want to touch him they want to meet him they want to see a cre creation the real creation wants to see the Creator a creation that wants to see itself is not in the form of God because if you are in the form of God and you were created that's why the people who who knows very well that they came from him even now they are looking for him amen they want to reflect him they want him to reflect them because they came from you take chickens or anything that is Born the mother G gives birth amen after that even in humans when a child is born the first thing he he he can smell milk from Mama but it is not by a smell that is the nature that I came out of he goes back to Mama that's why the prophet say respect your mama because she was the first person to see you when you will come and now as soon as the child this baby is born he is born with the revelation of this kind when he start to sck one is not to to do what what you say okay she will never turn to anybody but to M because it came out of did you see that now that's why men can live a man can leave children and go on drinking spring thinking not about his children but watch the heart of a mama I
