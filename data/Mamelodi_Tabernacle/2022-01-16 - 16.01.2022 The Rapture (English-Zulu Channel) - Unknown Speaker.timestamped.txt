[1:32:44] now
[1:32:45] you know when we were in malawi we are
[1:32:48] seeing
[1:32:49] the same
[1:32:51] surprise about
[1:32:52] the where mostly we were on the right
[1:32:56] hand
[1:32:57] side
[1:33:02] of course
[1:33:03] because the bible says here we back a
[1:33:06] little up and that is
[1:33:09] revelation chapter 5.
[1:33:14] this is what the bible says
[1:33:20] um oh read my brother you can go faster
[1:33:23] than i am
[1:34:30] is
[1:35:13] he's earning his own
[1:35:15] to what you have seen and have known
[1:35:17] uloco
[1:35:22] when there is a war
[1:35:25] they call the veterans
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:36:09] you know as peter says
[1:36:11] peter we were with him
[1:36:14] in the holy mountain
[1:36:18] and our eyewitnesses
[1:36:34] as i narrated this again
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:50] but
[1:36:56] there were some
[1:36:58] what do you call this newspaper people
[1:37:01] uh
[1:37:33] from the place the figure in the wind
[1:37:36] and
[1:37:39] the writing
[1:37:42] came like this
[1:37:45] that this is
[1:37:46] now the news
[1:37:56] and i took note of that
[1:38:00] news
[1:38:14] then i sat down now
[1:38:17] forgetting all about the other
[1:38:20] newspapers and so forth
[1:38:24] now i wanted to hear the news from there
[1:38:28] is
[1:38:39] from the inside
[1:39:11] there could have been some newspapers
[1:39:20] but when
[1:39:21] somewhere saying this
[1:39:53] no money nobody has to put you into a
[1:39:55] constitution
[1:39:59] and the weight will be held only by
[1:40:02] those
[1:40:33] you have rejected life
[1:41:01] me
[1:41:16] then i can't rest until i know we have
[1:41:20] again
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:24] because he says
[1:41:26] he went that way
[1:41:29] reflected in your soul
[1:41:44] i'm
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:42:12] europe
[1:42:30] christ in you i'm repeating
[1:42:36] but you is not actually
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:41] i'm not saying this to everybody maggity
[1:42:44] when
[1:42:46] just like
[1:42:52] began
[1:42:53] everybody
[1:43:35] and you will receive it
[1:43:49] now the message comes to your
[1:44:18] in you now you can just say christ
[1:44:23] everybody can say christ
[1:44:25] okay
[1:44:46] but only
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:58] because god himself is an object
[1:45:41] of god
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:46:52] because you
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:47:18] a man
[1:48:02] i was thinking even this morning
[1:48:07] when the bible says happy bible letting
[1:48:11] that that is filthy
[1:48:15] lawyers
[1:48:30] line
[1:48:34] of no return
[1:48:38] those that are in
[1:48:41] their constellations
[1:48:44] are going
[1:48:58] foreign
[1:49:05] is
[1:49:27] after the seals are revealed
[1:49:32] and
[1:49:33] food because it says over eating
[1:49:37] the revelation of the seven seals is
[1:49:53] let us look at this a bit i guess
[1:49:58] this one oh where am i looking
[1:50:01] i think
[1:50:02] there's somebody who can
[1:50:04] try something because i've got to look
[1:50:07] up like this every time
[1:50:10] maybe
[1:50:11] somebody can do something and lower
[1:50:15] it a bit
[1:50:17] i know that
[1:50:19] we are looking at the people back there
[1:50:21] but we still can lower
[1:50:23] this thing
[1:50:28] talking to somebody about it
[1:50:35] is it possible
[1:50:49] people who will be raptured oh
[1:51:04] but i will start here
[1:51:06] but today
[1:51:10] the rapture is a revelation to her
[1:51:18] take note of that i've had a look
[1:51:21] there
[1:51:23] it's not just a scripture
[1:51:27] because without revelation
[1:51:46] that's why paul says
[1:51:48] you are written a pistols name read of
[1:51:51] all means
[1:51:58] did you hear him
[1:52:00] meaning that
[1:52:28] m
[1:52:41] because he thought of uh
[1:52:44] coming down to us
[1:52:52] he has to come in the same station
[1:52:56] as
[1:53:10] is
[1:53:36] all right
[1:53:38] amen i was saying to my brother
[1:53:45] this message
[1:53:48] is the revelation of the word
[1:53:52] says we
[1:54:03] you god has made you
[1:54:06] imagine
[1:54:33] because it's those supernatural things
[1:55:03] now let's look at this i guess rapture
[1:55:06] is a revelation
[1:55:12] that the revelation
[1:55:13] the true bride of christ
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:44] makes
[1:56:12] a wonderful
[1:56:27] you yourself
[1:56:30] as the
[1:56:31] scripture says
[1:56:34] you yourself
[1:56:36] know that we are
[1:56:38] the lord
[1:57:23] and it says now
[1:57:26] christ's life in you
[1:57:30] have you ever experienced
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:34] what is
[1:57:49] god said to me stop
[1:58:18] yeah it's
[1:58:33] don't go this way
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:39] but if you can do something against
[1:58:42] me
[1:58:44] you are not his son i will see you in
[1:58:46] the terminal
[1:59:00] is
[1:59:13] in that way
[2:00:10] he snatched him
[2:00:13] sweet
[2:00:14] from the devil
[2:00:17] even about the the some written woman
[2:00:38] is
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:02:13] [Applause]
[2:02:30] uh

[2:04:32] armageddon
[2:04:34] are we
[2:04:35] empty
[2:04:48] me
