[23:59] April chapter 7 okay
[24:03] from verse 24 to 20. 6
[24:07] [Music]
[24:09] but this man because he continues ever
[24:13] have an unchangeable priesthood
[24:16] wherefore he is able also to save them
[24:19] to the uttermost that come unto God by

[29:59] paragraph 118 here mole paragraph 118.
[30:03] yeah so
[30:04] so to bring us to the meaning of this
[30:09] great
[30:11] contact with this with that great magnet
[30:19] are you glad you are in here this
[30:22] morning okay
[30:26] um
[30:28] one place it says mortal beings
[30:36] let me start from day 14 this party
[30:40] I have never believed that heaven was a
[30:44] place where there's a bunch of buildings
[30:54] where there's a bunch of houses up there
[30:58] made with Motorola
[31:01] foreign
[31:39] it's in the human heart
[31:44] and all the resonance fade away the
[31:48] [Music]
[31:51] God becomes the festival
[31:57] like in this morning
[32:02] uh
[32:04] I have
[32:07] sometimes back I know how I was invited
[32:10] for the a funeral on Sunday
[32:27] that's all
[32:30] I mean so that's why I I do not attend
[32:35] attend I'm not giving out a lot to some
[32:39] other people
[32:40] but I'm saying I don't attend funerals
[32:44] on Sundays
[32:48] in respect of the Resurrection Day
[32:54] amen then
[32:57] uh nothing I don't do things in fear of
[33:02] the people
[33:04] I do things in fear of God
[33:10] amen like sometimes one would say in the
[33:14] morning I'm I'm going for my my my son
[33:18] like orange I'm going to help to
[33:28] my heart
[33:30] I will
[33:32] only that my my mother is late
[33:36] and they wanted me to come for such a
[33:41] thing

[33:49] I said no no
[33:51] Sunday morning
[33:56] so I must be in the house
[34:01] amen all right
[34:09] there's two natures
[34:14] now the every time there's something
[34:19] happening like this funeral on Sunday
[34:22] morning
[34:27] then we will check
[34:29] which spirit is going to
[34:32] and
[34:34] catch up
[34:40] Sunday morning
[34:48] which spirit will catch up with that
[34:51] this spirit says
[34:54] you you get what I mean that's why we're
[34:57] looking at the the great in getting into
[35:01] contacts
[35:10] and
[35:11] uh

[35:21] are you
[35:23] um
[35:25] what time is it
[35:29] because if you don't know the time you
[35:31] don't know what to do

[35:41] that is
[35:43] Fellowship by
[35:45] Redemption
[35:47] not just fellowships
[35:51] Redemption is to do what yeah
[35:58] is to be taken back
[36:04] that is now that that's why we have this
[36:07] word Redemption
[36:13] they redeemed
[36:15] the people that were taken back
[36:23] that means they are redeemed
[36:26] called the bank again
[36:31] because you have no starting points on
[36:37] did you know that now we will read you
[36:40] we will read it amen and here it says
[36:49] heaven was a place where there is a
[36:51] bunch of buildings
[36:55] [Music]
[37:00] currently no I want uh I never believed
[37:04] that
[37:05] supernatural being who already
[37:08] would have to live in a literal house
[37:14] I believe when Jesus
[37:20] my father's house
[37:25] [Music]
[37:30] a Dwelling Place
[37:34] amen amen because uh it says and
[37:39] [Music]
[37:41] for the scripture they verify that is
[37:46] the same thing and say
[37:49] if this is
[37:54] we have one already
[38:15] let's hope
[38:17] Immortal beings
[38:19] live in immortal habitations
[38:27] amen amen then the place that we go into
[38:31] until we return back is not a place of
[38:35] brick and mortar oh another fellow
[38:38] [Music]
[38:41] is
[38:45] your stones
[38:55] let me now
[38:58] get down to this yeah

[39:34] Mars
[39:38] and they look at yourself
[39:45] and so forth and light traveling at so
[39:49] many thousands miles per hour

[1:42:24] who was that we were in the Holy
[1:42:27] mountains
[1:42:30] foreign
[1:43:06] melee
[1:43:08] they wondered

[1:43:15] something like this is
[1:43:21] amen
[1:43:22] then

[1:44:06] till today I've never had somebody
[1:44:11] asking Peter about it
[1:44:16] because there are things yeah we we've
[1:44:20] got testimonies
[1:44:23] but that one could not be used as a
[1:44:26] testimony
[1:44:30] no one would say to somebody
[1:44:33] they praise the Lord God is wonderful
[1:44:37] you know how he took people
[1:44:43] amen amen
[1:44:45] it remained with Peter
[1:44:49] amen because
[1:44:53] it comes to the mind Hey Campo

[1:45:00] Elijah
[1:45:02] right on top of them
[1:45:07] there was a song yeah

[1:45:31] just like
[1:45:34] we read this I've never had somebody
[1:45:37] talking about it
[1:45:40] the voice said come up here
[1:45:45] and
[1:45:46] I will show you
[1:45:50] now I've heard this brother singing
[1:45:54] I've been on the mountain and I've seen
[1:45:58] the other side
[1:46:02] I've been on the mountain
[1:46:05] and my soul is satisfied amen amen you
[1:46:12] know my soul is satisfied
[1:46:14] because I've been on the mountains
[1:46:25] he's talking of now if you take somebody
[1:46:31] and he sees the other side
[1:46:35] he won't enjoy this side anymore
[1:46:42] that's why according to the testimony
[1:46:47] when somebody said I've seen this boy
[1:46:53] at the place
[1:46:55] where there is a big cross there is a
[1:46:59] wall

[1:47:05] efforts of the people
[1:47:07] trying to help him
[1:47:14] and he said okay he showed me that cross
[1:47:20] and I'll find my
[1:47:23] um
[1:47:26] he didn't
[1:47:28] need any more helpers
