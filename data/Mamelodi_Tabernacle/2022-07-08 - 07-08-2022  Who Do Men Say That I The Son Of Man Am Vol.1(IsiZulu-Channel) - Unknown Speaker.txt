the pastor has a long list of houses for dedication we the board have noted that visiting each house will be a long process and will prolong the history to fast-pace this process we have suggested that the best approach is for the saints to send the following pictures of the house the house piece that is the picture of the house piece the full name of the house owner the address of the house the picture of the household now all this information will be sent to the pastor so i have displayed the whatsapp number for that so you just send all this and the [Music] god bless but at least

[Applause] [Music] those that are calling the word of the lord [Music] to um because by his works we can see okay me [Music] matthew 16 verse 13 to 19. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philly he asked his disciples saying who do men say that i the son of man am and they say some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets he said unto them but who say he that am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon but jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto me but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen amen let's turn to another scripture i forget about time foreign the woman said unto him i know that messiah cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus said unto him i that speak unto thee and he and upon this king his disciples and mother that he talked with the woman yet no man said what's he called or why took us down with him the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city and said to the men come and see a man which told me all things that i ever did is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him in the meanwhile his disciples played him saying master eat but he said unto them i have meat to eat that he knew not of therefore said the disciples one to another have any man brought him out to eat jesus said unto them my myth is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then come at harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the field for they are white or ready to harvest and he that wreaketh receiveth wages and gathered fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that ripped may rejoice together and here in is that saying true one saweth and another written i sent you to read that where on he bestowed no neighbor another i send you to read that where on he bestowed no labor another men labored and he are entered into their neighbors and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that i ever did so when the samaritans were come unto him they bestowed him that he will tell with them and he about their two days and many more believe because of his own way god bless you you may be seated isn't this wonderful [Music] because that was john chapter 4 i want to come to this place that is 38. of the woman who testified he told me all that i ever did [Music] so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he he would
