with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Spirit with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into amen amen which things brother the Angels desire to look into and but to us they were revealed due to Luke you may take your seat firstly I just don't know what happened to my wristwatch it is more visible than uh yeah hey there's a giant one there yeah brother I don't know uh I think there is no place here for that Hercules well maybe we can hide it here under Neath not that far okay sorry yes let me start by reading this uh like seals sales and page 98.98 93 93 I don't know sometimes yeah but I can see don't worry yeah yeah I want to read this party because uh let me read first it says no with the lamb with the book in his hands around you know this book where was it strong oh you don't know oh let's see brother where was this book now I can't hear you it was with God then gave given to Adam it was in the hand of Adam yes amen why I believe it because now I tell you the reason why I why I know and one what why you know you remember when John started to write and he said don't write someone because it was not time for for it all right I don't know if you you will say Amen when I say Gregory this book yeah it's now in our hands amen amen why it was given to Adam because it was given to Adam as our marriage certificate now all the family Mysteries were in that book gallery now but today I don't know if anyone can believe it that it is amen yeah all right why I believe that it is this book because my name is in this book the whole creation they were looking probably Village you see when it was opened what happened right amen when it was opened the whole Heaven roared Lord when they saw the lemon coming with the book because there was no man Worthy Adam has for sale for Has Fallen adamawa is so now surely the length of the tribe of Judah he has won the battle amen and was Worthy to open the book so the whole creation they were looking at that book but there was no one worthy to look into it until a Lamborghini when John introduced this lamp the Lamb of God take it away the sin of the world he is the wealthy one okay amen then what happened when he came with the book you watch what happened in heaven Road and John said Every Creature heard me already foreign and even John knew that Johanna my name is in that book I'm a now I read here now in this Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself took the book foreign so the book was in him he is the only one who cannot know who could do it he took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne the throne was within him as the prophet says I'll tell you something the only way God can operate is from the throne amen amen now you can be a preacher unless you are a throne amen because a preacher Murray is just God's Pulpit if amen that's a real preacher okay now before the king can address the subjects before he can address he spoke to us from history now the first rule in heaven the second through Jesus said the prophet of God amen amen now usually you never believe anything unless it is from the throne amen because he says if If Ever I he said if I speak that word shall never return to me foreign then it says and and let us look and pass the curtain of time because if he opens that book we can look our past and you see what was there and what is here because this book was there before their Foundation their Foundation okay now it carries now we can what what if he opens the book and let us look at past the curtain of time because if the book is not open we still can see but we are on this side but when he opens the book we can see a paste just and and to bring to all his redeemed subjects to reveal them now when we hit this in the seals we are going to go back there and see them songs now the Bible says Hebrews chapter 9. he is the mediator of the New Testament okay amen now what I'm trying to bring this one now and his subject is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption he walks from a mediator where death put put us in the Gravely he has come forth okay amen no he he walks forth from that means from being a mediator now I've got so many on this mediation Elijah he is no longer a mediator after the opening camera of the seventh seals and then as he said in that day you shall know I am in you in us but when that's why Hebrews chapter 9 says the mediator of the New Testament amen but now this is the Seven Seals but you know after he opened the seventh seal yeah when he come the first time to them he was not a mediator because he was with them when he died then he became immediate but when he was with them he was with them but when he died the Bible says then Hebrews 9 but every night he was the mediator of the New Testament all right amen but here now it says now he walks from that far meaning he he no longer a mediator he always walk from the the mode then he is now in US AME the seven seal brought him in now as he comes in no longer immediately standing for us again he is with us when he is in US is not a mediated this is what I see here he he yeah he but now he come from here at this last seal yeah he is whoa page 83 one Series right amen and there's another many books saying the same thing is no longer mediator we made it because okay before the opening of the seventh seals when he died he became our mediator but after that no longer is needed women when he is in you when he was with them but when he died he died for their sins I will go to the desire Angel's desire to see these things that's why when it was open in heaven because and they only desired things let me read this one here firstly now we find that whatever is six seals has been revealed to us we we see it real world and let us take it from here what is the six seal also let me find it opened is Moses and Elijah they opened the sixth seals amen okay amen that the prophet speak for himself amen 20 two is a I mean page 20 I can start here I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I was brought East to open the seals for God right while we are waiting there I want to say let me read this part I was foreign Moses and Elijah I'm trying to find them here I've got three books here let's start with them how they say the six was opened we will see how the seventh was open we know how it was opened when he stood there is standing here to open to us and what happened now we are watching him then he stood up there but then suddenly he just said everybody quiet now that that's how that seal was open quiet now he said he is here he is here to do what right and then when he stood like that you will start to say all quiet and he will start to say then we see the special opening up it is look at it eliminate let me repeat this John Johann was a foreign unlike the seventh angel messenger John could Point him out but as a man standing there but brother brilliant April Brothers stood and say we are now he is here um he never said behold now if he says he is then he will start to say the opening of the festival because it says I saw seven angels and I was brought East the headquarters is what in the garden he says I was brought East because when he was in the garden he was the god of the Earth all of us because he was Eastward in the garden that's why before the seals were opened man who was brought East because that way he had the authorities in his headquarters which was called The Garden of Egypt God was in his headquarters he could say anything amen amen amen there he is have you seen what happened you look at them I learned a lesson with the animals I saw one I was with a brother he was teaching me to hunt you want to talk to hunting with some dogs amen so we arrived at the place there was an animal age now I I want that same but what why this animal is not running instead it is looking at us then I couldn't understand I said maybe it wants to fight or what because it's a small animal like this now as we were getting closer then it came straight towards us yeah then I was wondering what's wrong here it made it past us why because carbon its house was on the back side of us it couldn't run directions yeah the book was sealed was written and on the back side now brother Brennan speaks about it the backside Ministry you go back to the original go back from Big to be before the fountain foundation of the world it is on the back side the message is coming from there amen amen that which was from the back side which we have seen with which we have stats What's the Word of Life silence so the ministry that we have the backside Ministry don't believe any word if it is it was not made flesh the real word the real pasta real pasta the way that is made flesh because he doesn't preach himself you are also a backside subject you are only here that is from The Breakfast that's why we need pastas because they will tell us about it which was made flesh all right if it is a modern Ministry we don't need a modern Ministry the back side of the book amen but now it says terrified the silk book okay this grace mercy upon us to open the seventh seals to us and let us look at level 11 our past or fatal you know if that book is opened now you can look up past that's why he says it was all silence and I passed the curtain of time seven changes speaks of time it's ages and the prophet of God says that's why you will find twins in each now if you are in this if you are in that church age we will read that we are not we are not in the seventh church we have done Pastor that is in the seventh church we are not a message now we are speaking of the bride of Christ [Applause] [Music] summer in England summer days it's called The Bride not in the message I said that said the thing taba the thing that will come that revelation the last thing that it will happen then he said it will happen at this church then I said it's not Brandon is he is preaching not to bring them again that is the bride of Christ so the message was not revealed uh to the entire bride of Christ amen is that right now which one yeah that's why we are here in Africa and he loved Africa free amen amen something in him about Africa free then I said when I I was in Mozambique we preach about it the the word of God what was it the title in the jungles of Africa let me hear one person amen what was the title the word of God in the jungles of Africa yeah I preached that I think in Mozambique so now it doesn't refer to Brandon no we have our brothers our sisters that's the bread of Christ all right amen now I'm looking at this but now he comes from here at the last seal is no more immediate foreign and that he said I believe that he said Philip I feel don't you know I am in my father foreign amen so it was Mad Father and Son but when they after the Holy Ghost came and Son and the Holy ghosts but do you watch him before the Holy Ghost came he just said I am my father he never referred to the effects because the Holy Ghost he couldn't mention anything to be the third King but after the Holy Ghost came and he said all right amen the number of Perfection okay now I reach it now he is a king he works forth from a mediator this is an announcement foreign to you is not a mediator because Let Me Wait for your admin first to you he's not immediate amen because he is let me put it here together where is that book uh [Music] Christ did you know that hey Christ is the mystery Christ means Christian anointing culture where is Christ is the mystery of my brother now Christ the mystery like I it's a great book Christ is the mystery of God revealed be careful then it never said Jesus Jesus because his ethnic name is Jesus it is not a mystery but Christ is Christianity because Christ is the anointing characteristic approach but Jesus after Jesus the name Jesus the angel said call him Jesus cheers it was and we're friends to say Jesus is the Christ foreign because the Jews knew for you to say he is making him oh God Amen now that's why it says Christ is the mystery of God revealed today let me repeat again it doesn't say Jesus is the mystery of God revealed I reach yes Christ and even with Abraham little Abraham it says uh we are the seed of Abraham which is all right amen the Seed of Abraham Perry Abraham is Christ and you watch Abraham Abraham how many people have seen Melchizedek this is amen so the third pool was a man in the house the third full made flesh in the house of Abraham they didn't just speak about the third pool in the house the third pool was made flesh and it was in the house it came to us as a prophet that's why we have seen melchized he came to us as a prophet now they waited that brother Branham there we have heard the message foreign amen now when he said who is this milk he said he was talking to you because your flesh cannot answer that question Abraham met him but foreign amen Ibraham knew that is the one without further why the ministry was to his family is there are seven seals books the seventh seals is for the theophan is your father the seven seas [Music] right okay now it was silence in heaven [Music] listen tell each other uh there's a book here oh wait do it where is my tending in the Gap you guys standing in the capyaka amen another thing brother I don't know extending in the game all right amen you know it's not just like a man standing in the cabin man which game standing in the government we could because there was a game Adam has left his post Adam he left a post again now here comes the prophet and says standing in the game then I don't have the book with me says No it is when Adam left the posts the Lord came down as a substitute Jesus Jason it is to become a substitute foreign he could not put something else in the place of Adam Yet to Come himself because you should know that was God of the Earth he could not be replaced to see another man had to come himself on the body of Flesh to come to them to the place of Adam called the second Adam Adam left foreign I met the prophet then the Lord Jesus and to shed his blood you know his blood they discovered that it's not human because it says that's why when he was born there was not there was no Joseph's blood today because with the seed of God then you read your spoken words spoken ready then the prophet of God says when the angel came remember with the word certainly then Mary Maria he lived in the way he said and then that way materialized amen amen not a human spam the word of God not to realize it shall be called because amen it has got nothing to do with Joseph [Applause] not a bit of Mary's blood of God Amen hey you you find it in your spoken ready came as a way very believe it that's why we are redeemed by the blood of God now that's why in you blood that materialized amen amen amen the blood in you might become away is the weight that materialize then you are born you are born again amen amen okay amen it's not a substance I see substance okay amen did you know that that's why you can you you can't fall because we don't you wonder why I can't fall well because the Bible says of God kingdom can foreign [Music] the weight of God says the word of God says they can change it and said he is I will repeat it again it is in the book adoption yeah adoption we are much in which book adoption adoption adoption we are a martial Gods amen the first time I saw it said this is what I was waiting foreign sorry end our likeness so if then God says to you you are like me you are a minor God says no no no I'm not God I'm not [Music] I read to you after God come around with you created you our soldier he looked at you God wanted to see himself in something um amen amen he is pleased when he can see himself then that's why it says God looked for a Perfection on Earth and it says but finally I fell alone there came out after creation of things and finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection Patel you watch what God calls Perfection it's not because you don't smoke that is not perfection the Bible never said if you don't smoke you are perfect but what God calls Perfection is this and he looked for Perfection upon the Earth and Perfection and that was a man foreign [Applause] now [Music] amen amen you condense yourself to the likeness of God until God says he's like you see when you look for Perfection says he looks at Christ is he can only see you in Christ in the Book of Genesis Ari the the blood is not blood put somebody out to the post what happening on the door I mean I mean then the death angel when it comes knock at the doors hello hello are you message Believers and you say yes that people would throw away the beer bottle and say yes he said put the blood put the blood when I see her the blood mighty amen amen amen he looks at the um no he says URI God don't look at you and he even said maybe I don't think I said God look at Christ that's why now was there and the Lord said I shall look upon um foreign he should see you in Christ not because you are dancing he looks at Christ amen then if you are this child he sees you in Christ when he looks at the boat all right Amen brother we closer now and it says here and then I read this almost every day then he could see in that mess that it looked like him amen amen he didn't look at the sweet of that man no amen amen or the dress or what else he looked in um God is not like a man you can't dress up to appease foreign [Laughter] I mean amen amen there's no way I can please God the only thing that can please God when God sees himself in me amen amen God seeing God Amen I think we know what is Christianity religion is a form we are not really Journeys we are Christians amen the Christian democrats according to being a religious a person somebody who believes they read about God that's why uh Isaiah says it will find its place amen amen fellow don't sometimes we get so mixed up when the people reject the word of God you know I explained to him if I the Lord he says amen and the weight will accomplish mean two little pen what it is sent for say listen to you amen amen if he sends his way to you accomplish you'll be a genuine Christian love with love long-suffering Temperance because foreign there's this scripture the love of um because a person who loves money they can tell lies come on even if you can say I'm hungry I don't have a job [Music] instead of giving him something Laura offends something

this game you realize that's where Adam left the posts are faded the book the title is the amen of God is the bread of God Amen and the bride says he says now godim came to the Gap it couldn't remain as a game God had to close the campus but the mystery is amen the Gap was supposed to be closed where are you yes because the operation our operation between God and Men God and Men amen amen even in creation it was between God and Men God would bring them to Adam Adam to call give them names God would say Amen oh you can see it down the line when [Applause] this man was going to arrest the Christians very soon he was called let us repeat when he was on his way to arrest the Christians what happened God made a roadblock for him and he Blended him at the road and they said hurry now you are blinded yellow forfeit yeah I've done this to you now you must go to yeah he will tell you what to do you see it started there in the garden he would move a thing sent it down to us after I created some let's say I type yeah maybe it's a lion and maybe it will say now Lord what is my name is amen because the prophet says uh it is not complete reached Adam if it's about to find a name the Bible says Adam gives a name to that products the first amen came from God amen amen amen yeah so that's how it was God wants to to God wanted to continue with that now when there was a kid he didn't please God now the prophet says and then what did he do to the Gap foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] brother brother name he preached extending in the cafe I was standing in the Gap now if you are listening from your feel funny how does that means all right amen it's not just is talking about something here foreign now foreign [Music] he's coming where if you see what do we have the only thing is was not genuine because government the knowledge didn't tell them that which I can't run from God Amen I mean I mean no that's why around is not giving you knowledge to Hallelujah and fire and all that a lot of faith the Lord will give to men yeah because when Adam was running a voice calling truly means is still calling even today can you hear that voicemail Elizabeth you can't leave that post please go to something else the only way to please God is to come back [Applause] God will be pleased only when you are medium posts but as long as from the game he is brother Brendan says then he wants you to be one with him let me read something here [Music] foreign [Music] um and what happened did not this happened amen right amen whether I say is a vision or what but it happened I mean and they said the Bible says then we said yes that's how he opened amen the Bible said people literally God said I shall come and deliver you looking out of the bondage amen the thing is how he did that local while they I we were anticipating here come one of their brothers then the Bible says biblier he preached to them that was the ministry of Deliverance they rejected him they rejected because he is a man they're looking at them and even when they look at himself we've been here for many years now this man with this dick because God when he approached Pharaoh you know the time he used to let my people I mean why because God said to to Moses Moses I have made you God Amen amen God himself was a God to Egyptians so God challenged him with a god if it is God the challenge should be performed by challenge so this God of the Israel from the Israelites the unveiling of God when God was in Moses Moses was God Amen that's why he said my people so even Pharaoh wondered because he said let my people go Mississippi amen amen until he stopped him from operating from the water America committee that was this God he closed the Gap there foreign they didn't know that Moses is God because it says when they went to us in Moses amen is that right now that's why he let them out and God call it calls it the road of God a simple rod from a tree but because it was in the hand of Moses MP3 it's okay Egypt okay cipila then they started off but Asia he followed them you know after you have given your life to God don't relax and say Oscar foreign and what happened and God said Moses Moshe tell the children of Israel to go forward amen amen so Moses told them until they crossed all right amen remember but when they crossed the opportunity he also Leonard walked on the dry land is that if they can cross so they were also but what happened right God was watching amen amen so they were coming close they even saw their eyes looking at them because that pillow of light came between pharaohs you know if you are a child of God there is a line between you and Satan and Satan cannot touch you amen so now we came between um because they see what the rich the Red Sea in what level did not recognize the Egyptians but with the children of Israelites it is said that the sea saw that amen the Siri the sea recognize Israel did not recognize Pharaoh April whatever amen at a certain line amen amen God just unscrew the wills of the Chariots You Must Fall us amen and the children of Israel Israel appeared on the other side okay amen that's how but the other thing is when you see that when there was pharaohs there was the Red Sea how many times you find yourself in that situation then God said go forward amen don't discuss about him I have delivered to you amen amen if God has saved you should walk on foreign a sister came to us I think I was with my older brother here um he used to go to uh no I said to her sister you are sick attacked and so foreign oh really I mean get

baptizing your problems now if you cross to the other side is left behind us when they were on the other side and then now the topic was not very topics there was no more you know very Lord God was dealt with no more but what happened everybody was now the unbelief they died in the wilderness there are people who have believed by the end they are suffering after they have believed and they cross over but in the wilderness the Bible says we believe because of unbelief man now they could testify hey you know we were in Egypt they praise the lord we crossed now we are on this side hallelujah hallelujah we are saved amen amen yeah we have conquered him but hey they had not yet reached the Promised Land life is foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign there was death we want to live in the second place the festival he left the Egypt wilderness they were supposed to cross to the other side there is some Messengers they are called joshuas Joshua it is in your own book this is Joshua Joshua they will take the people to the other side costs them you watch this ministry this ministry it's not a church ministry it's a Ministry taking the people across it's that Ministry we we are crossing now we

ask I will give it to you and because you have hit the spot managed to cross over now on this side now you should be on the other side with Elijah he was supposed to be on the other side listen on the other side he said and he said ah the double portion of your spirit amen where guy on the other side ask for the he asked for the double potion and he said if you see me taken away give spill from you then it shall happen hope foreign brother let me put it right here when did Elijah ask Elijah to ask now on this side of Jordan or on the other side on the other side all right I'm pardon on the other side yeah now we are on the other side of the seventh seals and he said ask what what do you want me now Elijah Elijah Alicia Alicia knew that Alicia God is only his throne in Elijah that's why he didn't bother to say oh Lord God he looked to the throne he knew that the Throne of God is in this man when they were on the other side as we are now on the other side of the seven churches and anything can happen only if you know who you are where where you are gonna ask you will receive it when you are on the other side yes sir that's right I mean you start here until you are on the other side and then what happened he said if you can see me going it will happen to you that is not the end of the ministry yeah you know if the prophet uh could be yeah no no no they're going away of the prophets it's not the end of the ministry amen what happened is that Jesus also said yes I must go thank you again amen amen because when he is here it is like this even a woman will come inside is it rightful for me to wear a trousers if the prophet says the prophet allowed me to put on my snake is is that Christianity no but if God took him at the right time for he said to disciples you benefit
