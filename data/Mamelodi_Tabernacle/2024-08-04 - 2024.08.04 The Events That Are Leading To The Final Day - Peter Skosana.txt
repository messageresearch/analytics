Description:
Title: The Events That Are Leading To The Final Day  
Preached By Elder Peter Skosana  at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 04 August 2024.

The Elder read the following scriptures:
Revelation 22:7; 2 Corinthians 11:2;Revelation 19:7; John 8:18; Revelation 1:12; Revelation 4:1
; Philippians 4:9; John 16:12; 1John 3:9; Romans 8:16,19

The purpose of the sermon was to show the people about the Events that are leading to the final day. 

The natural marriage types the spiritual one. The marriage is between us and God. 
The Prophetic visions are:

The first vision was that Mussolini would invade Ethiopia.

The next vision foretold that Adolph Hitler would rise up as dictator over Germany.

The third vision was about ISMS, Facism, Nazism, Communism.

The fourth vision is the advances in science that would be driverless cars that will be driven without a driver. 

The fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age.

Then in the sixth vision there arose up in America a most powerful , but cruel woman, this can either be the rise of the Church , it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women.

The last and seventh vision was the distraction of America,  the terrible explosion of America.  This will not happen in our time. 

Jesus come 3 times, to Redeem his church, to receive his Church, and to be with his church. 
The 3rd throne is in our heart. When you do wrong things , you must know that God is not on you. When you are angry, He is not in you. 

God cannot make you to preach about a place and not show you that place. 
The revealed word makes you a potential god. Son of Men is God in a Men.
When your dream has been interpreted it becomes a vision. 
The bride will go beyond the Church Ages, and the Church will not go beyond that.  When you go beyond the Church Ages you meet the Angel. 
The New Commission is for the Bride and not for the Church.  
If you don’t know that your body needs to be changed then yo...

book of uh Revelation chapter uh 22 I will read we will read only uh verse 17 brother Harvest let's just read verse 17 only 2 ver 17 fell and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that he say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely you may be seated God bless you okay today um standing in the gap on behalf of the pastor uh who is recovering wonderfully now he said I must pass his greetings to the church amen amen he's regaining strength day by day and then he's going to surprise us [Music] one amen amen so we are so thankful this morning we we we have just read one uh verse that speaks about the spirit and the bride uh that say come actually what I want us to Fellowship about this morning it's just the events that are leading to the final day those events has to do uh with uh the harmony of the bride and God [Music] himself so because they should be unism they should unite these two the bride and the groom now the the unism or the harmony that is within them it's called the marriage you see naturally we have a marriage and then after marriage we have a ceremony so whatever we do here it types the Real [Music] Marriage now in in each and every marriage uh there is a proposal proposal propos proposal yeah the the two started proposing each other or or the bride proposed I mean the the groom proposed the bride then there's a agreement of the two now if there's that agreement of the two and then there's a time where now they they they unite and become one that that's what we call marriage now uh we as the bride we there's a time where we Unite with our master or our brave groom now to fellowship or to worship God it's not just to come to the service is is to have an an understanding of actually what are you doing and then you become part of what is happening and then you [Music] also have an understanding of the events that are happening because you are in a process from eternity to New Jerusalem now while you are in this journey you should know exactly where are you at this moment and and what speed are you traveling at and how far are you to reach your destination you see always the pastor types give give a type about the the flights of there's a time when it take off there's a certain speed that it [Music] takes and the force and then there's a time where now it's C cruising there's a cruising speed also and when it's going to land and okay there will be the disturbance of the velocity of the Winds but the pilot is not disturbed [Music] [Applause] about then as he's going to land there is some other things that will be happening the speed and the force and everything now we are a bride not the church now I'll will show you the difference so now what I want us to Fellowship about is this marriage this coordination between us and our God when we say this is a marriage actually what is it how how do we get together us and God are we together now there should be some events that will be leading to the final day uh that unites the two together the bride and the [Music] groom there are some prophetic visions that brother Bram had you know them we had seven of them it was mol when he invaded Ethiopia you know about that was the first one the second one is ADF Hitler now these are prophetic Visions the prophet saw them that it will be like this and before they happen those [Music] so in are taking Ethiopia then you saw ADF Hitler on the second world war you know that then he spoke about the fascism nism and communism so the first one was fascism the second one was Nazism and the third one is communism that's why we had fascist we had communist I mean I mean I mean and the naist so that that is the third one the fourth one was science you know about it science now we spoke about uh the cars that that science will improve in such a way that they will build cars that you don't have to drive it you just give it an information I understand there is such car there is a car of which when you go to the mall you don't look for a parking you just get out and tell that car to look for parking and then you go in then it will go and look for a par it is there there somebody that has got that car here in this the church I just don't want to call his name right the prophet saw that yeah as before and then his the fifth one is the moral [Music] Decay then said the olden days the way uh women dressed it was a shame to see just a p cot a garment just by mistake that woman can cry the whole week so in the olden days they they dressed in a in in a very nice way now the prophet saw it before the Min skate came and the jeans came yes now if you dress in a proper way you become the most stupid woman that you you you are behind time the remember that that was the fifth one the sixth one was a powerful woman he says there will be a woman a woman one that will be so powerful and it will be voted by women so he said it could either be a church because a woman types A church or a a woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by by women some are guessing whether this vice president is it not the [Applause] one when I Was preparing this message busy checking who voted for this woman I find that is women that you know what who I'm talking very powerful now he's taking Trump left and right right now the last one is the destruction of America now where are we now we are on the sixth one because the destruction of America W happen during won happen during our time because it had to do with missiles and then once Russia can throw a misile that's the end of the world because they say that missile is like a rocket when it explode and then it explodes into different missiles [Music] and those missiles they exploit also that's explo also and then we have uh gases gas yeah on on on this planet Earth planet so those gases will also explode we have fuels we've got pipes where we've got oils and things like that so the whole the whole planet will explode that's why it says now it will shake the Earth back to its position because the Earth is in an angle because during the time of Noah H there was a lot of water and then it cost even the tilting of the how am so then which means that the up to one to moral you know the women now you know it's it's only you when we talk about women we are talking about you the sisters here otherwise I always I told you when I go to any mall I just check whether I will meet a sister just a woman that dressed in in a in a right way I'll will get one or two but they will not be that perfect according to the we but they'll be better okay fine so now let's know where we are we now it's a time for that powerful woman because the six Vision says there will there will arose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete complete [Music] power that's it amen so now we are we we are uh we are going we are almost we are almost there but now what what is going on now is you where is your position remember we are waiting for the coming of the Lord that has to do with the changing of our [Music] body now what's going to change your body we're waiting for the the groom we are the bride and the groom is coming to fetch us so Jesus came three times three times he first came to redeem his church then he came the second time to receive the church he he will come and receive the church we are waiting for him to come and receive us then he'll come for the third time with his church and the other thing we have to know his throne his first Throne was in heaven that was in judgment seat then his second Throne was in Christ now the the third room is in the bride amen that you should know amen you should know that the that Throne is in your heart whenever you do a wrong thing you must know that now he's not in the [Music] [Applause] throne because if God is in his throne then god is perfect then he expect perfection [Applause] when you are angry just know that God is not angry you and when you are lying must know God is not in you because he supposed to be his throne supposed to be God supposed to be a potential God you don't control yourself the the god that is in you is doing his [Applause] thing are we together so now uh the bride let me just uh introduce nicely this thing what is marriage now or what is the stage of being married in our case is the bright and the we not only the weight they revealed it can I repeat myself our case I will tell you why are you called The Bride but not the church the the the prophet says when we meet here we are not in an arena no no we said no the church is not an arena it's it's a it's a meeting place of [Applause] Believers it's a mystical Body of [Music] Christ right now the the most Saints and Maas they when they worship God they worshiped him in different dispensations now each and every one of us has got a strong Zeal to meet God you know Moses saw a burning bush Bible says so and say God spoke out of that burning and the angel of the Lord spoke also out so Moses was communing with God like we are communing with God whenever we meet communication with and whenever we pray we communicate with our father but we have that Zeal that we want to meet him one now Moses had that Zeal I want to meet him but he was with him day in and day out speaking with God day in and but he wanted to meet him until he said I want to meet now we was talking to him he says I want to see you you see amen it's like maybe a young [Music] man who want to get married he will always dream about what type of woman am I going to have or meditate about the type of now we meditate about our God I was I was I was speaking to the pastor the Pastor said I saw New Jerusalem amen then I said pastor that thing you have to tell me but don't tell other people they won't believe [Applause] you because if you can go to heaven right now and come back and tell people that you were in heaven they're going to give you a [Applause] displine I said to the pastor God cannot make you preach about a place and don't show you that place so Paul preached about the different bodies celestial bodies C and glorified bodies God took him to Third Heaven he saw what he was preaching when he came back he was you know he cross Dimensions he said I know a man in that heaven I don't know whether I was in this body or out of this body but I saw that and then where is that heaven see now brother bam brother preached about different dimensions and then God made it a point that he visits that place now now what happens is this you cannot visit New [Music] Jerusalem in this body and then you can never visit New Jerusalem uh without you being that Jerusalem because you you must be it then that is the visitation and then when you are telling somebody you must take him and he must be that Jerusalem and the two of you we meeting that Dimension now and then when you are through you come back here and come and and talk to us that is why John saw it and he was with somebody else and then he wanted to kneel and that man said no I'm one of you I'm not God because he knew nobody can go there unless he's God that is why the prophet says we are potentially you see the revealed word makes you a [Applause] potential so there are events that will make you to cross over you cross over so remember that now we have what we call dispensations you must always know in which dispensation are you right now then in that dispensation then there is a Ministry you should know your dispensation and the ministry because if you miss the right dispensation you'll have a wrong minist and if you got the wrong Ministry then your faith will be diverted your anointing will be the first one I the false one because you are in a wrong place amen are we together I always give you this example about Moses that now Moses uh he was taking the children of Israel to the promised land he never was in the promised land it's Abraham that knows the promis but now God cannot say take them without showing you that that is why I said to Moses come and stand here look that's the place you see and Moses saw it then God said you won't enter into but Moses saw [Applause] it you see now God cannot promise you eternal life without showing you that eternal [Applause] life that's where now we speak about the Revelation you know the prophet says when you dream and then when that dream is interpreted then it becomes uh it's no more a dream now because it has been interpreted uh it becomes now a vision once your dream has been interpreted then it's no more dream it's a vision you seen something then interpretation brings that something then it's a vision now that is why when you have a dream wait for the interpretation okay now the Bible says the spirit and the bride say come what is the bride what is the difference between the the spirit and the bride okay the bride okay we you know the Bible speak speaks about the Son of God and uh no it speaks about the the Son of God and then it speaks again about the son of man are we together the Son of God and the son of man when we are born we are born in the we as a Son of God now when Jesus Christ came to the Gentiles he came as the son of of God I'm talking about the the Gentiles to the Jews he came as a son of man he was coming to cap the Pyramid of the Jews he came as the son of man son of man is God in a [Music] man God himself coming as a man now he came to the Jews and they rejected him and then he came to us as the Holy Spirit the Son of God now we are going to where we are the Son of God the son the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit types the blood isn't it right now after that then he came as now the son of man to us the bride that is the difference between the church and the bride you the church ages from the church you need to cross over when you cross over to the seals you meet an angel then that angel It's called the angels of the seventh seal and the ministry and even the dispensation changes let me go back a little [Music] bit brother as a prophet uh the the mission or the commission he was given his ministry was to change to come to us and bring the word of God but before you could bring that word of God you just you just before we came to the pulpit says behold I sent you Elijah the prophet what would he do that he should change their heart of as the children to our fathers Paul Peter and then last time when I was preaching about the unable riches after that so what now now there's another commission which is called the new commission I'll read it for you for you here now the the the the the the the new commission is for the bride not the church the church is the seven Church ages then therea cross over then when you cross over we are no more the church you are the bride are we together all right now there is a a part where David said oh let me say Paul uh brother harvest the second book of Corinthians chapter 11 let's see let's read the second verse now the eagerness and the feeling of seeing our pastor I mean of seeing our our partner because there's two that are getting married a bride and a groom and some of you uh they're not even aware that they are [Music] married because it's it's it should be a sin of course a sin yes if you are married and not knowing that you are [Music] married see you've got you've got a spiritual [Music] husband but not on the negative I'm talking about Christ the the revealed word that is your husband he has married you but you should be aware you should you should you should be able to produce your [Applause] ring and say yes my marriage ring you must know it and you must be able to to display it you see amen okay fine we're talking about that that you should know that you are married just read that scripture I said 2 Corinthians chap 11 11 verse 2 verse 2 for I am jealous over you with Godly jealous that's Paul he what he says he says I am jealous over you but with Godly jealous Godly jealous continue my my brother for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ now here he says he says now I am I have espoused you so you are you have been espoused to one husband so that I must present you as a chest Chas uh a chased virgin to Christ now a chased virgin it means then it's it's undefiled and now the Bible continues why it says where he says I will receive you that's unto myself Paul says I have espoused you are we together now the Bible continues and says I will receive you unto myself right amen that's what the Bible say now verse chapter 19 chapter 19 uh if you read verse 7 Revelation sorry 19 S verse seven we can we can read that one now we we we we we we we are we have United with our husband it's just to make you aware otherwise if you don't have that then uh you miss the rapturing Fai because you're waiting for the Rapture what is the rapture the Rapture is the quickening power quickening power is the changing of the body now you don't leave the body here and be taken by a RT and look at your body and say there's my body no your body is [Music] quickened the Bible says the second Adam is a quickening spirit your body must change now what will make your body change if you don't know that now your body needs to change then you don't have the rapturing faith because the rapturing faith the Bible says with the same spirit that he rose Jesus from the dead he was going to do that so now you must have that same spirit that same power that can Quicken you our Lord Jesus Christ when he resurrected there was nothing in the Tomb there was nothing in the Tomb brother bam speaks about the first resurrection now the first resurrection says uh when you receive the word of God then he shows about he speaks about the the 10 visions five were wise five were foolish but they were [Music] visions and they were waiting and they all slept the the the foolish slept with their foolishness the wise slept with the wisdom right but when the word came the wise Vision light out their LS that is called the first resurrection they resurrected to the eternal life they cross over they don't go to any judgment they resurrected but now the second Resurrection will be in the Judgment the foolish virgin are going to the Judgment then they will Resurrect The judgment are we together so now with with with with the first [Music] resurrection it's ET so now the bride has got the first resurrection the bride will never go to any judgment he has resurrected to [Applause] Eternity and the bride must know that that he's got the first resurrection that is why at at times we should not be disturbed by the worldly [Applause] things they are there you've got the power to overcome them right now it says revelation 197 uh it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready now the the the the Readiness of uniting the two it's it's when the two United together because you must be a witness to that you know our Lord Jesus Christ when he was here while we are opening the book of Romans I mean John 8 John 8:18 last time I told you that now you must be witness of [Applause] yourself you must be the witness of yourself now Verse 18 read it my brother I am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me now what happens is God as I've said cannot make you a bright and while you yourself you are not witness of yourself look if you are sick and then you come to brother here to pray for you and you without him he will never be [Applause] healed because you must be witness of yourself that this man will pray for me and I'm going to be healed you see you are the he he is not a Healer no he's just executing the duty the gift but but the person that must receive the healing he must receive it before he's prayed for he must know that I'm in a right man I'm before the man of God then he will lay hands upon me I'm going to get healed that is why they rushed to Jesus some will touch the H of the government knowing that if this man can just ATT a away I'm going to be healed are we together so now they said to to to our Lord Jesus Christ you keep on saying the son of God God at times you are God you don't even have witness of the you yourself you don't have witness he said no I bear witness of myself now that was not the man Jesus speaking no it was not man Jesus it was God himself he says I bear witness of my who can be the witness of God because when he saw about himself he's the witness of himself now they say to God you don't have a witness he can easily say where were you when I created heaven and because I was by myself my witness was my [Applause] mind and in my mind was a bride because it processed from my mind but he said I'm I'm a witness of myself now brother Bren in this uh spoken with Revelation chter 4 part one in in in in in paragraph 8787 says so there's going to be a meeting in the air that is eruption says one of these days but there cannot be a meeting without a marriage amen are we together amen and then he keeps on say he says NE PGE your heart from all evil thinking and then he says have faith in God no matter how dark it [Music] looks and how many laughes and makes fun and says you made a mistake says keep right on living a holy and living for God he says just keep moving on the hour will [Music] [Applause] arrive let me read a very long uh uh quote here he says now in this uh book here proving his weight proving his word I'll start from paragraph 236 here paragraph 236 now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham no that could desend the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh don't miss that now during Abraham's time it was a man in human [Music] right amen remember the Bible says so shall it be the days of Sodom there will be God in human flesh we will come to that but it was a man in human flesh of which Abraham called Elohim and it was the days of s now he says now watch clo uh and Jesus said as it was in the days of sod so will it be at the coming of the son of man I said there is a Son of God and there's a son of man the Son of God is the seven Church ages when you cross over to the seals then is a son of man now is the time that you are living in the time of the son of men so will it be at the coming of the son of right amen now remember that the coming of the Lord is a process there are those that slept during the first church Age The Bride during Paul's time and during IR time during Martin's time Luther Wesley and even in our time there were those that slept before you see but now the Capstone is the son of man we will go to that when the son of man is being revealed right then not no more as a church no then he says he says see not noral you know English yeah uh not no more the bride is called see it says now it's no more a church it becomes now the bride when the son of man is is revealed to them right not the church church is ages that's why it says Church ages is time but once you cross cross over it's another dispensation I said we should know the different dispensation [Music] once the dispensation changes the ministry changes the Revelation changes the faith changes the inspiration changes it's another dispensation of not of the Church of the Bride now what what is that change that change is marriage is the word now becoming a revealed way we getting married in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word is God you see now it becomes the revealed way if it becomes the revealed way it's revealed unto you now that is your groom that is your husband look he said I stand at the door and knock and what do you do you open up what does he do he gets in what does he do it D with you he D with you that is why every Sunday you come here to D with you because he not now in your mind in his thir Throne now right so now we are called a bride do you see the difference between the church and the bride I want to read it again now he says Now not no more as a church you see it but the bride is called now what for to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride when the church the seven Church ages are over the head comes to the church then the church becomes the that's what that's what is called marriage to unite now the head and the church once the head comes in then it's a bride when when the pastor marries you he combines you then he says that the two should be one now now with us now with our husband he's our then makes he makes us with his word he makes us his bride we are married to him that that we should know now that we are married to him then what we receive now is the rapturing faith the changing of our bodies now he is the one that is going to change our bodies with the word that he is revealing to us that that word the revelation of that word is the revelation of the son of [Music] man are we together now we are living in the days when the son of man is revealed now when the son of man is revealed it makes you a potential God and when you are a potential God there is no gate that can be closed for you as there was no G that was chosed for [Applause] him together then there won't be any demon that can stand before you if it can stand before you then which means it stands before the potential go but that should be life it's not a recitation you don't read it it becomes your life [Music] together the breakr call will come right through this are we together when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together now he says here uh the the bridegroom will call and he will come right through this what we have said the marriage we come to this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together I'm not talking about when he coming to rapture no when it comes to unite the two together the angel of the Lord or the seven angels descended what for they came and pick him up and after picking him up what happened came from the West going Eastward what for to open up the SE to R to reveal the SE then that changes that's a new new ministry it it changes that's a new commission that's another dispensation I would like to repeat myself when I read here say the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to to unite the two together he comes in human flesh to unite the two together right amen and then once you unite the two together then it makes you a potential go who came in human flesh having a book that carries our name look the Bible says he that overcometh I'll give him to eat the hidden man there's a man that was hidden it will only be given I'll read you the code the prophet says it's for specific [Applause] people you see if you don't have a white stone you won't you won't know your name because he says I will give him even a white stone and his name will be written there and he will know his [Applause] name so you will know your your new name because it's written in the Lamb's Book of Life the church has to be the weight he is the weight and the two unites together right and to do that it it takes the manifestation of the reveal of the revelation of the son of are we together Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us to unite us he says he will come in human f now people when you talk about Jesus Christ they think about oh that food or where is it okay fine it's not here yeah that one now when it says he will come down in human flesh it doesn't it doesn't mean when it comes to Rapture in rapture ing us we going to change our body going to meet him here he's not coming here no we're going to change and meet him but I'm talking about what the prophet says here the church has got to be the we because he is the we and the two unites together and to do that it takes the manifestation of the re of the of the revealing of the son of man then he says now Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and and will make his way real that it will unite the church and him as one he will come and make the church and make the word being so real understanding Supernatural understanding Supernatural knowledge that it becomes a real thing the word becomes real he will make it last time I spoke about the unable riches it's when that word itself it works itself in you the the pastor used to say when you drink castor oil you don't dance around and make it to work on you you just relax it will work on you you see when the word comes is the one that will work on [Laughter] you amen you don't have to dance he will make he will make the words so real and that will be uniting the church and him the bride then she will go home to the wedding Ser after she is already United see we go to the wedding serer not marage marriage is here right now we are in the marriage ceremony not what you call we we have been mared by the [Applause] word right amen okay fine you know what the prophet says I like what he says he says uh you you you have to be a fighter he says you you have to be a fighter I'm looking for that code I'm looking for that code yeah yes it says You must be a soldier not a new recruit you must you must be a soldier let me read it for you and you must be a soldier and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits you are aged soldiers now and been trained to fight and the Satan will come among you cause you to dispute with one another turn him down just immediately immediately you are Brethren and he's the enemy and we are here to hold the standard the when the world is dark we are the light all together when you fight don't use the wrong weapon right now they use missiles and Rocket there no time for Bo o room no they're using rocket don't fight with a wrong weapon and your weapon you must hold it with your right hand and you must swing it to the right [Music] direction otherwise it will never find a Target and it will never destroy your enemy [Music] when you have your weapon you must know that you have the right weapon and when you direct it it must reach the right place uh I understand I don't know I've never joined an army but the the the the the the basic strategy in the army the first they they teach you to unite must be one thing and you must be orderly and you must be disciplined you must unite be one thing when you're going to the Army you're going to fight you must not be enemies and you must have order and you must be disciplined uh years back I saw a a battle between America and [Music] Japan and then Japanese are very short then they will take uh the branches and even stems and hide with them as though lot of you think it's a bush it's human beings and then they will move a little bit and then one soldier saw that these trees are moving then he went to the send say such the trees are moving then the s said I know now he was shivering he he wanted to shoot but the sergeant and the cap knew that they won't reach the target he want them to come closer and this one is J and in the Army you don't shoot until they tell you to shoot so the captain of the ship when he's in the ship he's not disturbed by The Roaring waves he's got an experience he is the captain of that he knows that it will never sing he's been traveling in that sea for years he's been trained on that you'll never be disturbed by that or the velocity of the and he knows that his crew has been trained now that's a season Soldier he knows when to shoot doesn't waste his bullet shooting in the air no he shoot for the Target now his first enemy is fear as a soldier your first enemy should be fear now what causes fear that is why Jesus Christ says fear not that's why the angel of the Lord when he comes Daniel throws himself down says fear [Applause] not when the prophet was in the cave reading and praying he saw a light the logos coming and then it dropped yet it became a man he said fear not the first thing fear not a captain hates a fearful Soldier you know that in the Army you can be caught Marsh because because of fear they armed you with Necessary Things weapons they gave you generals they studied that war and everything you've got everything you have your country behind you you have everything there so when you go there you go there knowing that I am representing my country now when you are a bride you know that now you got a better place than this one it's an eternal one don't fear and fear not that is why he said tell no one because that thing is yours it should be revealed in [Applause] you so now we as a chest virsion uh the word unite us with our groom when the word here unites with a person the we combines with a person and the two become one when the we combine with a person who is a person a person is when the word germinates into your [Music] heart and then when it germinates into your heart it brings your self which is your theop when it comes to Perfection it becomes your theop when the we here unites with the person that person is your soul you see the soul is the nature of your spirit when you are born naturally we are born in your nationality but when you are born spiritually H you receive divine nature your nature changes then it becomes a divine nature and then now when you are a perfect person then we say you are Divine when the word when the word has created a being in you that being is called yourself you see amen okay let now the Bible says uh let me read it again or let me qu let me go to another quote it's it's still Revelation chapter 4 paragraph 105 he speaking now about he says if you read uh brother Harvest let's go to Revelation chapter 1 Revelation 1 uh then verse 12 uh are we together are we lining up you definitely have to be a witness of yourself [Applause] right verse 12 Revelation 1:2 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being T I saw seven golden candles sticks now you see the he says he T to see the voice that was speaking with him there was a voice that's [Music] speaking and then after I turned to see it what happened saw seven golden candlesticks he saw seven golden C right Revelation 4 ver1 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hether and I will show the things which must be hereafter now here I'm just want I want to show you the two voices the other voice made him to see the seven the other voice says come up here listen what the prophet says after the church Ages was over and everything was uh uh uh come down I mean everything was come ready made ready the setting of the fourth [Music] chapter then the church Ages was gone right amen he had done left the Earth you see remember the voice that spoke to him behind him in the seven gold in the seven golden candlesticks the work was finished which means the the church Ages were and now that same voice was speaking up in heaven is finished with the church ages now that voice was speaking now in heaven now that is the changing of the dispensation and the changing of the ministry but it's the same voice that's side now it speaks from heaven now when you cut over to the seals you go to the Heavenly things are we together it's it's a voice the very same voice but now it takes you as the bride we are the very same person that had the virtues you had Faith you had virtue you had knowledge you had uh uh Temperance on and on and on and then from there on you are taking over you cross over and when you cross over you become now a bride we are getting married now you are a bride now it's it's a revealed way it's no more a word is the very same way but now it's revealed it's the very same voice but now it speaks from Heaven are we together the same voice was speaking up now but in heaven he had done redeemed his people yes thank you his Earthly work was finished he was in glory calling to John come up here right amen this is the setting of The Great Battle this is a very serious statement the people that rejected God's message rejected the Holy Spirit the messenger of the seven churches the one um the one that had rejected this message of his grace had nothing left but judgment is a very serious statement the one that rejected this message has nothing left judgment right amen and that we know that there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky right amen do you understand right let's continue and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready says now you have the material here on Earth you the bride you have the material that will make you ready [Applause] now what is that material that will make you ready you'll get it on the new commission what is the new commission is is is when now the word is revealed unto you he came with a book and then that book had your name now in if the name is in the L book of life there are some things that now uh you know in the book of Philip we come back chter 4:9 4:9 I want you to see this now it says that you have the material on earth now to make yourself ready now your Readiness should be a Harmony Philippians 4:9 Philippians 4:9 those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen now it says now those things which you have leared have leared and what after you learn what do you do reive you receive because you have heard and seen you have heard you have seen you have learned you have received right right remember that the Throne of God is in the heart of men and the greatest battle is in the mind now what was in the mind of Abraham when he met what was Abraham thinking when he was communing with with with with with M or what was in the mind of brother because the Bible says we should have the mind of Christ mind of Christ amen now brother Brenham brother Bram when he calls the squirrels into existence what was in his mind because you know he said he said I didn't hear any voice no he didn't hear any voice no but he just decided and call those squ and then it was said to him God said that is your third fool you created squirrels into existence and what was in the mind of sister Ed when he said nothing but the truth brother right amen and what was in the mind of Paul when he speaks about the the the Battle of two Natures he says now I'm a human being I've got two natures and those Natures are are fighting so now these things they start from your heart and go to your spirit and go to your mind now if there's no word in your heart then there's nothing in your spirit then there's zero in your mind your thinking will always be zero in terms of the word of God your [Music] reasoning will always be zero now what what what makes men to see visions that is because his everyday life is a song it's a scripture it's a verse he's thinking it's about the word of God and when you think about the word of God it takes you what you thinking about it takes you to that [Applause] place and when you pray you you don't pray a God that you don't know you pray God that you could see his vision you've never seen him personally but when you speak you speak like somebody speaking to his father your father is standing here with him right that's why it no man can come to me except the father then the the the prophet says the word manifest when the word is Manifest you see the father when the word you see it manifested then you see the father let me let me uh uh uh read you another quote here you can take a wheat and plant it in a different kind of soil it will never grow but what's good to have a certain fertilizer in that ground to raise wheat and there is no fertilizer and and if there's no fertilizer on that ground the wheat will not germinate it will never grow so no matter where the word Falls it doesn't fall in the right kind of heart you hear what he says it says now if the word of God doesn't find the right kind of heart it cannot germinate you can water read day and night the sun can come it will never pick up the life from because it landed in a wrong heart but he says yes in paragraph 261 unveiling of God it says and when you see the word made manifest you see the Father the manifestation of the word brings the father okay we uh we we read the scripture that says the spirit and the blood says come amen now the spirit and the bride say come Lord Jesus how many people do you see there one because the Bible says God is a spirit they that worship him they shall worship Him in spirit in truth and in spirit right now if if the word is a spirit I mean if God is a spirit so now the Bible says is the bride and the spirit now that spirit is the we in the beginning was the we the we was the we was called that that is the seat of God you know the scripture that I love in what you call we don't read it I'll just quote it you know it uh 1 John 3:9 it says John 3:9 John the Son of God does not sin because the seed remains in him because he's born of God amen right now it speaks about the seed of God know that one says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin yes it's right for his seed remain in [Music] him now the Bible continues and says greater is he that is in US so which means is the seed that is in us now how does now that seed germinate in uh The Book of John 16 in verse 12 verse 12 it says Uh there's quite a lot of things that I will teach you you won't be able to cross right but I will send you a comforter and then the comforter will take from me and bring to you you so it says you cannot B them now what I'm trying to say is to take the word the word is God and combine it with you who is the you the you is the soul that [Applause] is and now when once that word finds a place in your soul remember you were born in sin see now the word must come right into your heart and then you remember I I always called Romans 86 is speaking about your spirit and the spirit of God that they should be one they combine in one now I'm trying to bring the weight how does it come into your heart and when it is your the spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are the children of God right so the two spirit one with the capital S the one with the small they come to a place where they become one and then from there on that spirit is watering the seed what is the seed the seat is when you read the word of God but you don't need the natural understanding that word brings it Waters the we and then it forms another man a supernatural man in you now that's a marriage between you and the w now when now you are fully married and what will make you to be to receive the words of marriage what will make what will make you to say I do what will make you to do that it's firstly it's predestination now after predestination then it's the right dispensation now when is the right dispensation then it should be the right Ministry now Ministry plays a very important role because it's a seed that comes to their heart now if that seed comes to a wrong heart it will not germinate what what is the difference between you and the Pentecost Pentecostal they chase the the demons they pray demon will run but the difference between you and them is that after the demon goes away the Bible says they come and check what are you eating see and you find that now you don't eat the right food then they go and call another seven then you've got a problem now with that person that's why you differ because you you chase away a demon but you put the weight and when the demon comes remember that the demon he's not afraid of you he's afraid of the weight now you become the we then when you are the word it cannot penetrate that and you are not fearful now you are a season Soldier now how are we together now that makes you now a bright now that is the ministry of the son of man now if you go to Romans chapter 8 and think is verse 19 ver it's the same supportive [Music] Scriptures it says for the earnest expectation of the creatures waited for the manifestations of the sons of God when the Son of God is manifested is when he recognized the groom and is married now when you are married to the groom there's no demon because it must face your husband because now we are married now now that is the manifestation of the sons of God are we together in closing there was one brother who came to me and you are talking about underw brother Brenham here speaks about seven dimensions uh that is meta the Met time time whatever you call it science science Fifth Dimension Souls under the altar I mean Souls under lost souls lost souls and souls under the altar the seven Dimension now where is your uh under where do you place it then I said the prophet says there are levels in heaven and there are levels in Hell there is a level where the devil is there is a level there's a a level where the his angels are there's also a level where the demons are and there's a level where the lost souls [Music] are so in explaining I said the Bible says the devil is bound in Chains he says those that kept not their first estate then they were Bound in Chains then I said to him job I mean when God called his children the devil was there the Bible says he Bound in change and is in darkness how did it go how did he go to so now when we speak about levels we speak about a demon incarnating a person and then remember God uses your heart the devil uses your mind but you must know that now God and the devil they want you you is not your mind you is not only your heart but is the soul that and the Soul travels your soul can move your soul can [Applause] fight look you can enclosing we have dogs we have guns we have B proofs we have everything we lock our places but how does a witch come in why don't you shoot that person it's because he's in another Di the only person that can shoot that one is your soul because your your soul does not [Applause] sleep it's your mind that controls your body and then that mind is the one that sleeps that is why they come at night when you are asleep and do whatever they do are we together now they always want an an an an immature mind that's why they go for children because they are still growing not that their souls are growing their minds are growing are we together so now I said to the brother said brother there are levels there are things that you can see with your naked that were you you you you are a black man when you grow up you knew that I mean you know that they were witches where do they stay these witches how do they CL the broom why don't they fall how can you what you call a monkey and and and and dive with that monkey it's it's it's a thing that happens to another dimension but now they are all in the sixth Dimension but you are alive here you are not dead then they can take your soul we still alive because what keeps your body alive is your spirit so you'll be alive and then they can replace that spirit with a demon so you are a human being that has got a demon now that is why they come here in the service and even attack somebody you w you see somebody screaming you see somebody taken up [Music] by you just say but it's a being supernatural being and come and squeeze him and squeeze him how are we together it's it's in another dimension and in another level and comes he comes as your grandfather okay let me leave that now but now what I want you to see is that now the power that are in you is the revealed [Music] weight that is the marriage may the Lord bless you amen amen amen hallelujah let us ask our brother here just to pray for us thank the word of God can we bow our [Music] heads the original
