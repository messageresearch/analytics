Bless my God. Bless my God. [Music] Welcome. [Music] Truly, oh, [Music] we power with power. is with our Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. [Music] [Applause] Shalom. Shalom. As I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I was told to obey the voice of an angel. So I'm standing in the gap just to obey the voice of our pastor. Our elders normally say you can't do anything unless it comes by commission. So the pastor will always commission the elders and every time they follow the commission it comes with blessings. We have quite we have he had quite a number of testimonies where the pastor will send the elders to pray for a person and the person that they are praying for will say I see another man and each time when they describe that man we can see that they see the theopan of our past. So we are truly blessed to have a watchman because the word comes to him and he reveals it to the church. So whenever we stand in the gap, we go back to the messages that he preached. And when we listen to those messages, God always honor the man of God and give us a thought. So may the Lord richly bless our pastor. He called this morning and said today he just want to rest. and that he will see us very soon. So we are just going to read a scripture and continue on a thought that the Lord has given unto us. So if you can just sing the song that the pastor love and just say I'll be ready when Jesus comes. I'll be ready while is coming forth just to say a word of prayer. God bless you. Amen. [Music] Be ready. When Jesus come [Music] ready when she Happy [Music] way. [Music] Hallelujah. Let's go ahead and pray. Gracious and eternal father. Indeed, when you come, we will be ready to meet you. We have seen you many a times. We have seen your grace and mercy upon us. Indeed, we do not just take a step in our life without a commission. Amen. We are so generous in this word, Lord God. You make us to bypass our theophony and come in this world. Amen. We will be going back heavenly father to our theophony. But we see them always active. As our precious brother Mercedes just say when the elders pray for someone they see the theophony of our pastor. It's not a myth. It's true indeed. We will keep on appreciating your present amongst us. For Lord God, you brought us here to become more than conquerors. And we cannot be conquerors without a fight. Amen. We fight the devil every day because the war that was in heaven, we fought and we triumph and anything, anytime, anywhere, we shall triumph once more. We love you so much, heavenly father. Bless our pastor and his family. Bless the entire church, heavenly father. As our precious brother Miti is standing behind the pulpes this morning with our precious brother harvest to interpret Lord God. We knew this before the foundation of the world and we prepare the message Lord God. And you prepare our heart once more so that we can absorb. Bless them heavenly father. Put them under your wings. When they talk we should look beyond the flesh. When we look beyond the flesh, we see our theophony and that's where we take from. Hallelujah. Bless each and every individual this morning and all the activities we have seen you when we enter. What a good spirit we have. What a wonderful message we receive, we will receive this morning. Bless everyone, heavenly father. Those that are streaming as well, Lord God, bless them and bless everyone as we put all with the reading of the scripture as well. be the interpreter of it in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. As we turn to Revelation chapter 3 verse 20- 21. It says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth, I will grant to sit with me in my throne. Even as I also overcame, I am set down with my father in his throne. Amen. And also John chapter 10 verse 27. John chapter 10 verse 27. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. You may take your seats. Uh I'm going to continue with the same title, God condescending to his creation, but I want to take the text from the book of Acts chapter 7 where it says, "What house will you build me?" If we can just read this scripture, Acts chapter 7. Acts chapter 7, starting from verse 47. But Solomon But Solomon built him a house. How be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as said the prophet. Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me? Sayeth the Lord. Or what is the place of my rest? [Music] [Music] So what house will you build me? So that means we have a responsibility to build a house where the Lord will find a place of rest. So it's a question. What house will you build me? Saith the Lord. What is the place of my rest? So that will be our text. So we saw last time that it says the Lord will return again as the son of man. So he will be revealed in our day as the son of man. [Music] So that's what the prophet is teaching us. So I want to read few things from the spoken word hear 58 the prophet says and this is coming from revelation 3 verse 20 for the book says behold I stand at the door. It is the Lord that is standing at the door. And he says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in." We saw last time that when God was condescending, he was lowering himself. And the first thing that we see is the fatherhood [Music] in a pillar of fire. Then it was God with us. [Music] So he lowered himself to be with us as Emmanuel, God with us. And they crucified him. Then he comes again, God in us. Now when he comes in us, he says he comes to the individuals and he says behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice. So it is the individuals that will hear the voice and when they hear that voice and open the door he comes in. Now, it says here, "It's a rare thing to hear the voice of the Lord and to find a person that can say, "The Lord spoke to me. We should wait on the Lord. You see, we do all the talking. We don't give him a chance to talk back to us. If we will pray until our soul comes into the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice. But the prophet says there are so many voices in the world, so many things to attract our attention. So the Lord says, he that heareth my voice. But now we must be careful with the voice. because it must be the voice of God. You know many times people will come and said I heard the voice of God but when you ask them about that voice of God it is something else. The prophet says hear his voice speak back in your heart. So it's not a literal voice that will come from outside but this voice comes in your heart and the prophet says that voice is a word expressed. So it's not talking about the literal voice but it is talking about a revelation a word expressed. The prophet speaks about Peter and I will read this about Peter. But before we do that, there are few things that I want to read and I believe the Lord will bless us. Now I want us to look at some of the believers in the Bible. Isaiah, the prophet says he was changed after he heard that voice. [Music] And he also speaks about Daniel. He says when Daniel was in Babylon, he understood by the books of the prophet and he wanted to hear the voice of God. Yet he had the scriptures, but he needed to hear the voice of God. and he became desperate about it until he heard that voice. Amen. Amen. So the prophet says this voice is God in a letter form. Amen. This is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. So this voice is the entire revelation. As the prophet says here, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Uh paragraph 232. Amen. He's talking about Peter. It says now watch when Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." The Lord said, "Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never revealed this to you. You never learned it from school, but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you. So Peter heard the voice but to him the Lord says it came by revelation. Notice what he said to him. That's Peter, the rock, the predestinated seat of God that had received this light and was given the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is. You see that voice is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. So once it is revealed to you who he is then you have heard the voice and it gives you power. It says the gates of hell will never shake you. It will never prevail against you. a revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. Amen. Now it also says and this is what I like because the pastor kept repeating this and it has blessed me because it says it is based upon the revelation who Jesus Christ is. Now the prophet says John the revelator was filled was filled full of quickening power that stood up and seen the end from the beginning. Isaiah was full of the quickening power and stood up and seen the millennia. Now the prophet also says look what we have seen in this day. The quickening power has come to us to open the seven seats. So today the prophet says when you want to know who he is, he says he is the one who opened those. So the voice of God today is the revelation of who he is and today he is those sins. The prophet says Christ is the sins that was over. So that voice of God he says he who hear my voice and that voice comes by revelation of who he is and today he is those things that the pastor is always talking about the revelation of the service because today that voice is the revelation of who and that is Christ is the seals that was open. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Now it says here Christ in you makes you the center of life of the revelation. So that revelation of who he is the prophet says it builds another body in you. Hallelujah. Amen. Now the prophet says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you is what he calls the new birth. [Music] They ask him what is the new birth. Well, brother Brandham, what is the new birth? And he says it is the revelation of Jesus Christ, personally to you. So it's not just a revelation but it is personal. It is an individual affair. And it says from this new birth it builds another person in this image that you are. It says here cood paragraph 248. Paragraph 248. This body is subject to death and it will die. But the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die. That's the person that the new life starts from. Remember our text says, "What house will you build me?" It says, "What house will you build me?" But it is actually the Lord building the house in you so that he can come and dwell. But because you are part of his attribute back in the beginning, he said let us let us. But when it comes to an individual says what house will you because it's a personal revelation. Now that personal revelation, the prophet says, it starts inside of you from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person that you are that the Lord wants to dwell in. He build it from the revelation of who he is. So once you receive that revelation, then it says it builds another person in the image of this person that you are. the word that's in you materialize around that. So he's building another house, a house that he can come and when we read the masterpiece masterpiece, it says let let the Lord willing, let us read masterpiece. masterpiece. If I can find it. Ah, there we are. Thanks, my brother. Amen. It says, "But here the master builder." You see, the one that built that house is the Lord himself. He says, "I stand at the door and knock. He that heareth my voice, all that you have to do is to stand still and let him reveal himself personally to you. And from that new birth, the master builder re gives is a the new birth is a gift from God. Amen. It's a gift from God. That's why the prophet calls him the master builder. When when that house is now perfected, he steps inside. Then it is God in us. But first, he must build the house. Amen. Amen. God bless you. The prophet says, "When you read the spoken word to the angel of the Lord, the new birth is an experience, it is a gift of God. It's a seal of your faith. When his spirit bears record with your spirit, in an experience of the new birth. And the prophet says every birth is a mess. And he said there's three things that come from his body that makes up the new birth. Amen. Water, blood, and the spirit. That's why it says when he was talking to Nicodemus, how can a man be born again and he said, "Except a man be born of wood and the spirit, he cannot see the kingdom." So for you to receive this new birth, We start from the water. So that's why we have to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Amen. And the prophet says there's a spoken word impersonation of Christianity. And the prophet says something wonderful here that what happens after you are baptized. It says God actually uh take the old stony heart out and put a new fleshy heart. Scientifically we can't explain. And he says notice the order. First I will take away the old stony heart. With that stony heart you can't receive nothing. Then he said I'll give you a new spirit. Then the Holy Spirit. And he says this is where the mistake has been made. Many people rather come to the altar to pray and they get down there to pray and praying. They get to feeling a little bit better. They might get up and go up and jump around a little while and after a while you find they just bounce. They never received the Holy Spirit. So they just received the new spirit because the Lord said, "I'll give you a new spirit." Why the spirit? Amen. Why the spirit you had not even get along with yourself? So how so how are you going to get along with God? That means with your old spirit you yourself could not get along with yourself. So you can't even get along with cuz you can't get along with yourself. So God had to give you a new heart. Not a patched up one, but a new heart. Amen. Amen. Amen. He said, "I'll give you a new spirit." That's a new desire so that you can quit smoking. you can have a desire to read the scriptures. Then after that he will put his spirit. Amen. Amen. So the prophet says here three things come from his body that makes up the new birth. Blood and spirit. And the prophet says when you read the spoken word why I'm praying for the sick when I got the new birth I got the new blood. So he gives you a new heart, new spirit, new heart, new blood. Hallelujah. So he had taken away the old and gave you the new. God brings the new birth into you and gives you a part of himself. See the new birth gives you part of himself. Amen. When the new birth is come, you are changed. And that same new birth, he builds another body in you. When it is perfected, he steps inside. When you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you then have the new birth. You receive a new thought, a new life. But that is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You see the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally. This only comes to the predestination because the prophet we read it last time that we can receive the new we can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. and still go to hell. But with a new birth is a personal revelation of who he is. And the prophet says here you have got the new birth when you believe. That means you've got eternal life. The gift of God. by his sovereign grace, the gift that God is giving to you. Hallelujah. Amen. But the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you into the body of Christ subject to his services. [Music] Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is a different act from the new birth. [Music] One is a birth. One is a baptism. One brings you eternal life. That's question and answers on Hebrews part two. Amen. Preached in 1957. Amen. The new birth is different from the baptism of the Holy Ghost. One is a birth. One is a baptism. The new birth brings you eternal life. The Holy Ghost gives you power. So that means the other one receives the the revelation personal revelation of who the Lord is which gives him eternal life. You see, when you receive the new birth, it proves to you that you were part of his attribute and you start to build another. And God gives you the Holy Ghost, power, but the other one can receive the Holy Ghost, which gives him power, but it's not predestined. That's why the prophet says these two are different. Amen. Amen. Let's finish with this. The natural birth. Let me read his first birth brings him a natural man on earth. His second birth brings him a spiritual man of heaven. You see the new birth brings your attribute. The part that you bypass start to build in you through the new birth. Amen. It changes him. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Aren't you glad that the pastor has taught us this [Applause] there was a there's a testimony of a brother. Now this brother says the church in Modi is blessed because the pastor prepared them for the rapture. Amen. Amen. So we are blessed because our pastor is preparing us for the rapture. You know, we had an opportunity to have a fellowship with the el with the pastor. So the elders had an opportunity to fellowship with the pastor and he was telling us about the east gate. So there's a mystery about the east gate because even the Jews they watching the east gate because they said when he came for the first time he came through the east gate. So now he's coming back and they watching the east gate and the pastor says they are watching it and it's vibrating. It's shaking. Amen. So they saying he can come at any [Music] watchman. Amen. Amen. So the prophet says this new birth it's Christ himself. Amen. is the revelation. God has revealed to you a great mystery and that's a new birth. Amen. Amen. I want us to read a scripture here. John chapter 5 verse 25. You know this scripture we normally read it uh when we go to funerals. But the scripture is eternal says verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming. Amen. Amen. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God, and they that hear shall live. Amen. So I was looking at this scripture. The dead shall hear the voice of the son of God. Now these are not the dead from the grave. Because the Bible says we are dead while we are alive. Now it says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is." When you go to verse 28, verse 28, it says, "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice." Amen. It talks about the second resurrection. So these are in the graves. So you must not wait until you in the grave to hear it. You must because he says the the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God. And it comes again and says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, uh, chapter 8 verse 51, chapter 8, verse 51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death." Amen. So you can only keep his saying while you are still alive. So when you keep his saying, it means his word has a place in you. And when the word of God has a place in you, it says they that it says, "And when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God, You see during the seven church ages, it is son of God. Son of God. And during the seven church age, it says God working through men. But then it says he that overcometh. You see the the pastor says the bride is made of the overcomer. So he that overcometh. Now the overcomers are the bride. So those are the people that were dead. Then they heard the voice and the Bible says they that hear that voice shall live. So when you receive that revelation of then you shall live. Amen. Amen. I want to read this and we are preparing to close. It is the rising of the sun paragraph 309. Amen. It says paragraph 310 paragraph 310 the quickening power. Let us see his coming. Amen. You see the reason why he had to give us the Holy Ghost so that we can see his coming. The quickening power snatched us from death. Snatched us to life. That is the quickening power. So we have been snatched from death to life. Amen. Amen. I'm preparing to close. See, I'm closing my books. Hallelujah. Amen. So, I'm just going to read the last thing. The prophet talks about the the three-fold purpose and in that three-fold purpose.
