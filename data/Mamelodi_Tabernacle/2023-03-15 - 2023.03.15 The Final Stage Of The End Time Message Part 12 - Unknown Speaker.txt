TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen um we thank God for this privilege established a covenant with a company before [Applause] this morning and then conditions outside are the contrary to the human mind is but to us worship God under such circumstances produces equality um if you want to see a quality of things you should put them under pressure um when things are going smooth uh it will end up without seeing any quality is [Applause] um I was asking about the Believers from Hawking and uh the announcement was maybe too late um foreign that is a condition you know if sometimes somebody comes to announce the death of a family member we don't say you announce it late now that that's when you know sometimes you wonder why Jesus Took only three actually three brothers up in the mountains why didn't he take all the people to show them their Transfiguration experience it is because it is according to the quality amen and you'll understand today why the people on the seventh seal are in the minority it's according to the quality amen um our brother stood here to announce us um but the utterances he made concerning the message were so sufficient to save anybody else is already the quality of that announcement um could raise a dead man um amen now this is the end time brothers and sisters recently I was called to Gabon especially to talk about [Music] um our to talk about the Lost inheritance and how to restore it um amen and so we had to fly some uh many many kilometers we have one young celebration for the purpose of talking about our inheritance amen and while we were there with vladama City there was a brother sent from a Cameroon foreign foreign has invented us this one says he wants me to come there and preach about the seventh seal or 49 years amen so it is in demand yeah man not everywhere but from the people to whom the Lord has predestinated so they want nothing else because it's a pool the pool of the day okay amen now uh we are we are going to look at the in these things so I'm glad that we are here a quality today we can see now it's only a quality and that is those who worship God unconditionally once in his preaching he said something striking he said what um the Most Blessed people are those that are in his presence then he said God bless those outside there but the Most Blessed ones so meaning that the stages there is some stages of blessings he says God bless them the Most Blessed people and those not on the radio not on the cell phone but those that are in his presence man the Queen of Sheba the queen of Shiva realized this when she met Solomon while Solomon and said blessed are the people that are in your house amen amen amen so this morning I feel so much blessed and I'm sorry under this trying conditions the Lord has it up to this house so that it can be among Transfiguration experience a The Experience yeah let me say to you one time Jesus spoke something oh yes he said to his disciples accept a man drinks my blood the blood of the son of man or and it is flesh he has no life after this saying the Bible says many how many left you 70 of his disciples left him and then go back now did you notice that Jesus didn't follow them in trying to explain to them um no would take and because 70 plus 12 makes 82. yeah now Jesus didn't need 82 disciples now he wouldn't say well you others I don't need you you can go buddy he said something that was a contrary to the others uh foreign so that's how you will do it every time he will say he will say something that will draw some other people away from him and also into Ezra when the money amen amen amen in order to remain with equality all right amen now we were talking I was talking to some brothers about these bodies of ours how God has shaped them up emotionally uh naturally now as we are here itches because I don't want to put too much heat to my body because I I want to hear the word of God amen the money I don't see this morning this body with a too much food um because I want to hear the word of God amen amen so you can you can condition your yourself for something into small so it depends there it depends on that he is we we have so much to do back home there uh but when received a call from this side from our fellow man of God foreign we were trying to say this and this but eventually we said we we should go there and meet with our brothers and sisters you know because the third pool is so active and putting us everywhere around the globe um as you are going to see it happening right here you know God start by shaping things and put them in the right sphere yeah and then uh what I hear from here or I've been hearing [Music] it is leading to something like language see as we read we are going to read here and the message shines better when the people are in the right condition um if you came here for the world and you left everything and forgot about all other things then God is gonna speak to you part of data now you won't feel any cold I was over one night they will be no flu coming to you amen amen amen and you know if we go to places like where there's too much where there's some mosquitoes what do you call it yeah foreign his with when I said uh most of the cold that you feel is from your mind you see we are born oh this brothers are serious about the message amen yeah all right now I'm told that and there is a center Center Point in your mind a a KO and if there's an announcement from your brain that today is cold I'm not going to church then you are not going to church Yahoo uh not because the pastor or the minister says you should not come I am um it is because it from the center yeah announcement has been made to the whole the entire body that it is it's foreign [Music] the Bible says she said if people eat what that was in her heart now because there's a saying that is coming from the mind and it's different from the one coming from the soul uh amen then this woman she said hello if I can Touch the Hem of His garments okay I will be fine stay out in the police I will be here I'm this is what she believes if I can touch now it's personal now he doesn't say the Bible says so I got to eat or a ministers she personally says if I can touch if I can go to the service right now God you know who I am going to be blessed you will you will only receive what you believe amen amen amen let's turn to the Bible Matthew thank you Brenda's instrumental leader instrument a few two sisters or three from gauteng and was the mechanisms and brother um and the rest of the Brethren from this place amen as we open the books Let's go to this controversial scripture to some other people Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. Revelation chapter one amen this one yes chapter 8 verse one is Chile Lord chapter 80 verse one who's gonna Reach For Us in this one all right our local all right [Music] this too that's born is four foreign and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour just read also Revelation chapter 10 verse 4 only and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me fill up those things which the seven Thunder uttered and write them not uh yes read it that's four uh [Music] okay let the brothers first finish with this foreign and we move my own elements or uh because again foreign who will ask somebody who will I think it would lead to promise you know the song that says that means it means let us bow our heads after reading we must talking to our Heavenly Father it's another precious time to come before thee together with your children we are so glad that this day was specially chosen the father God for us to come and fellowship in this place amen we are not here father to teach the people we don't neither doubt do we know better but we are here to share amen with the people whom we have seen before yes when we were together in those Realms of Eternity amen when God looked down and the sons and the Stars yeah look down and down and started to dance around the Throne of God when they saw their framework that the what God was gonna do amen and we believe that this morning was is also in the books in the book of the Lamb that this morning will be gathered here yes together we the Saints yes not to talk about anybody but they just to enhance what the Lord has already put in our handsome by believing him that they will remain in the stages as set up in order to take his church through some stages for the church to reach the climax and we are so glad this morning Father that the seventh seal has produced the climax and the climate as well as father we believe that we are here for share these things that they con that the Lord has done to concerning this time that we are living in bless the sisters brothers and under these conditions father we believe that they will feel the warmth of the word father that will most powerful more powerful you know that the conditions the human conditions pray for the blessings of upon the word that we have read in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated amen amen brother Brittany one time let's say firstly I I was listening to the men of God here uh uh when he spoke about the stages although it didn't mean stages but I heard that he believes and he has seen that God comes in stages and even if you're reading the Bible in the Old Testament realize that God let his people in stages and each stage produced a special message for that stage [Music] um and we realize like brother Brennan speaks of the junction of time [Applause] it is in the junction when some people are crossing over some others remaining behind yes the dispute came at the junction yes the people who came together believe in the same Prophet but when it comes at the junction they started to stand family we're baptized together but they were coming through the stages they stood up against Moses amen amen and so this is the things I think as the children of God should look at yes this is then later we will look at the how the people some peoples the people separated and the final stage [Music] separating whilst while talking about the same thing the same message so but some others talking about the earlier stages of the message stage of the message who spoke about the Wilderness I against those who knows about that third part of it which is Canaan um so it's always the same thing it started back then let's look at the final stage of the end time message I want to give you that some title and the funeral the final stage the final stage of the end time message now we we are the bride of Christ but in which stage because the the the bride has was taken through some stages foreign now we sometimes need to sit down and look at the stage is because you want if you you understand what you are talking uh about if you don't know the stage that you are living in all the time that you are living is amen amen amen I was just saying in Gabon been decided [Music] that if you don't if you are not in the southern seal stage you have not given started to preach the message the message okay let's look at things now the final stage should be you know in a cycle is this ministry it's like a cycle lufana now in a cycle there is a starting point you go in a cycle we are we are you come back to the same point this is how God did his ministry how he brought about his ministry it will it starts from somewhere which we look at is to come back to the same amen now I will start reading to you something here as you are the message later will show that the prophecies when they reached the message was not Evangelistic amen you know here I'm here to talk to the people that are inside amen I respect an evangelist who goes out and say come to Jesus name is Canton all that she's Katie young girl he's talking to an unbeliever but when now the now now we are now here I'm I'm talking to the Insiders amen amen I can't imagine [Music] because you are the Insiders now as the Insiders I'm going to talk about the things that are found within yes [Music] foreign now if there is somebody even if even if it is his or her first time to come here nobody will happen if his name or her name is in the Lamb's Book of Life I tell you he's gonna or she's gonna catch up with the proceedings we will touch the original state state this is amazing amen they don't come because you condemn their their attire a prostitute now you know you all know about prostitutes [Music] you can't see them standing there carrying Bibles or so forth a amen amen have they are always half naked because they are there yet to attracted but this woman amen she has she you'd never find a reading the Bible she had a predestination then the Bible says if I believe she said in herself a messiah is coming and when he has come he he will tell us all things that's what was in that woman standing there with some shots for transparency in the highest hills um there was something that the Messiah is coming um [Music] amen so no church because she was waiting for the Messiah now there's some people here you were waiting for the seventh sea well then I I mean so no church can keep you I will uh you are made higher than just a denomination or a church now we'll read it here since I found the app because the message is beyond religion is religion can be any kind of worship religion and Christ is there seals that were revealed today who cries to Himachal in is not a religion I would imagine it's Christianity amen Christianity a Christian um if you are called a Christian that means you are Christ's like you are not a religionist a religionist um a person who believes things about God is but a Christian is a christ-like being a new Crest amen amen amen so let's read this the prophet speaks here let's start here uh I think it's page 64. I've got here Christ is the mystery of God revealed and Page 64. oh yes amen I carry this book everywhere if I don't have it then you should carry it because I'm gonna ask it for it Christ is the mystery now he doesn't say Jesus is the mystery you'll see now what is the seventh seal because foreign amen because it's the same thing or the seventh seeds it speaks of the same thing we will read it it is in the spoken way since I found I will listen take away now amen the conflict is around the fact that that God said nothing about the seventh seal is foreign [Music] all right now but let's start here this is God's great mystery of Love expressed that God and Men became one um amen amen now we can stand therefore therefore ages God and Men became one amen some people as I discovered that the enough once said uh maybe I can use this name godima one certain kodima thinks that he is god um and I said but and I said um God himself said let us make men in our image away [Applause] now if you say somebody is making himself god um it is because you've never heard God when he said let us make men in our image now if God said that that means if you want to see a genuine man then you want to see a man who that is in the image who is in the image of God [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music]
