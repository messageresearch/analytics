Description:
Title: The Migration Of The Citizens of Salem Vol. 2 
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 23 April 2023 at Mamelodi Church South Africa.

The Pastor in his opening remarks before he started with the preaching he read John 8:23 “And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.”
‭‭Revelation 12:10-12 “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhibitors of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”
‭‭Revelation‬ ‭12‬:‭10‬-‭12‬ ‭KJV‬‬

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The Migration Of The Citizens of Salem. The Pastor read Hebrews 7: 1, 24-27“For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;”
‭‭24-26 “But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.”
‭ Through the bible we only know of Abraham as the only man who met Melchisedec. To Abraham he is a King, and meet him as Melchisedec. 

The Pastor took reference from the spoken word 60-0221E -  Who Is This Melchisedec? 
65 When...

through the mouth of your Prophet without the battle that started in heaven was fought father and the enemy was defeated but the battle came down and became human Belfast and today Father we got engaged in this battle even now it is intensifying yes so much that the father if it was not because the captain was the Lord Jesus Christ we would all thought that we have been threatened and the battle is getting hot by day I mean but who shall We Fear because the Lord Jesus Christ is the captain we remember how Joshua he knew that there's a captain and they confess the city seven times and father it is just it was just like the church ages every day they would come past the city once but on the seventh day they compressed the city seven times bringing in the seven changes and the Seven Seals together and the walls came down amen we know even now that that Captain is still with us yet amen singing his sword and the church will compare Compass the city the city and that walls will come down amen thank you Lord Jesus Christ Whom Shall We Fear him because our King is the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Lord for the wait this morning we are praying unto thee that you will bless your children and hear the sick and arrest the spirit God is trying to come trying to compare itself with the spirit of God Amen and even there's even Satan himself could not overcome Michael even today even today he has no chance the battle was won already we pray Lord for your word is here again you are the word of the today as I pray bless your children hear the sick in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated amen amen I think we were saying something for a few minutes I I don't know if we were together in these things we have seen here anymore this book is a great book is who is this all right amen but it says when Abraham Abraham met him he was God all right sometimes you you will say you can think that we have read this last song only to find that it has not found the places I will still read to you when the prophet said something in me and it's so difficult for men to digest what is that something something in him amen amen sometimes we just end up saying hey meaning that it passes amen amen our amen should be amen because we see who have seen it king of [Music] he's a king [Music] that very same God yeah who became Jesus in flesh well I learned about Jesus in order to save our souls through his blood you know I have I had a book I don't know if it is not here how the prophet says when he died and the devil was rejoicing but remember Revelation chapter one when John met him he said foreign he came for that he knew that for him to uh get the keys he has to come through the cross amen amen then but there's a party even if I don't have the book yes where it says when he died there was celebration it is Jesus who when he was Tried by pilots Pilate a heathen Governor Pilato he went through his books how to judge this morning Jesus before Pilots Anya now passes was looking for a law to judge him but the Roman law well Jesus and he said to them I see no fools he wanted to know the crime of Jesus he will destroy the temple is uh these people right in their heads how can these men destroy the temples now he went through them and that he said to them I will find no fault and they said we find foreign Roman Ethan are I find no friends but those who professed those who were a church they said we find foreign all right but okay okay judge him with your own laws now [Music] but then the people who professed or godliness and he said all right [Applause] [Music] amen the Jew the Roman jewry find any yeah you could not find him okay I mean no I read something here and when then he died falsely accused [Laughter] then being falsely accused the Bible says he never mumbles knowing that it was written that it will go that way foreign Nancy I read this party then when he died the book of Peter says you know his soul went down because this is [Music] he is the Redeemer yeah but I love it when it says he is [Music] [Music] that's why it says in the book of Acts we are saved bye we are all you if you believe him now you you become of the bloodline of God amen have you ever thought of that of the Bloodlines [Music] of God have you ever thought about you or maybe not because you don't answer your question when he was buried like every dead person that personally I read this here because he became the poorest [Music] but she was the most blessed went down into the very lowest deaths of the lowest hair you know the Bible says he went down down and after the resurrection if he goes down he really goes down sometimes we have pride in order but not Jesus isn't James um sometimes if we are not of his nature amen amen but not Jesus he is love I don't say he has love he is the Bible don't say he has baby Wings he says he is Jesus said yes because you'd be looking for a way without him when asked what are you leaving foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] okay I am the way I am the truth I read this part when he died listen tillage he went into the very lowest that's of the lowest hair bearing our sins Arena and got the end of the strings he was holding two things foreign then then lifted it up I I promise in the resurrection with the other part of it amen amen Adam has lost the book now he came in how we we can humble ourselves today he is amen amen we were to be judged he humbled himself in order to die foreign after he took part of Eternity because he had to bring men and God together again that's what he came from all right amen you know today the people are striving to trying to bring the families together [Music] they always have family meeting family meetings and come together without without God you can't come together but when now surely he went because the Bible says he went down to take the string men bring men foreign foreign [Music] we are talking about our last week
