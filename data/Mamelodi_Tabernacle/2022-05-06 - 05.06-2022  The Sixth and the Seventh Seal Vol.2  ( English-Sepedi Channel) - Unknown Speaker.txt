been trying to chase us around again yes or no [Music] attending a funeral somewhere another one lord jesus said to us fear not so we think uh i have overcome defending the world the fast now this whole woman she's going to drop one day because they come to the church of god with him with their nigerian stuff and they will drop low okay now i want you to say now jesus christ said mourinho christ i have overcome a woman to uh to read to us i make sure every time when i come to the service that it is the lord that is invited to talk to us i will be glad to go back there but even here let me promise by god's grace i'm going to read something here um [Applause] i have something this morning song before we go up i i i've got something to look at which will show us yesterday i will start by reading this part okay uh yesterday i wanted to read something here which reached us because we are going to stick to the seventh church we will go to mount transfiguration is coming down from there elijah and jesus there's no more time finally he said watch russia king of the north russia again he said watch russia and he saw america america so all those things are here with us now and russia is but it the foundation of the world let us just stand up for a while and read but we are going to start from the side of the seventh seal is that is some time ago because this is the new world order thing new world order you listen to your prophets nothing will even death uh i'm going to this scripture and we believe that god will help us brother i'm trying to figure out here what what was this for the world all right to our bibles we i will start by reading from revelation chapter eight verse one tomorrow morning a scripture that says nothing to the people but they're saying something to the bride okay you know if you are going to talk to the to us you are funny because you are in the terms of the supernatural in heaven and let's start by reading this revelation chapter 8 verse 1 amen and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour our heavenly father here we come again lord at this point in time we have the brethren in here and we have pastors in here the shepherds and we are so glad that you are here with us amen lord they were again the devils were trying to spoil but yet we knew that you are here with us yes and you are going to take the service throughout until everybody will leave this place singing jesus is lord father as you said we should fear nothing and we don't fear anything this morning we are here to worship god not the devil so we are thankful to god that he is with us here as we open the holy scriptures and he will lead us on in jesus christ's name we pray for the word we are about to partake of in jesus christ's name amen okay so we and i left you with a part of the scripture here last night last night i must bring this first to you that is age twenty trying to comply i think you'll put on a paper something that will guide me so if it is on paper that at least we will wind up at this this time then it puts me in a better position i was supposed to read to you now we find that we find here that enoch was the seventh from before him died which was trans enoch was translated into showing that it is the seventh church age that takes the rapture it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture oh the rapture meaning [Music] but we are leaving emperor to our side because it doesn't show the things that are happening it shows the things puts it as what it was [Music] talked about yesterday which one is that you we are ready to read it and the first epistle of john chapter 1 which was from the beginning which we have had which we have seen with organs that which was from which we have had because the prophet says yoga that which was from the beginning at the we don't need to go to a bible school or what because the community is already which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the way of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us amen a critic saying to me that you message believers believers you are also divided how can god be divided you heard me saying at the wedding can so now if we are one with god churches are divided [Music] and he was not amen because he a walk with god it pleased god until he was not of all the rest of them he was not found god took him without death what does that mean when enoch walked with god the rapture is in you already working with god in his word divided i take a turn to have a fellowship with somebody we had that fellowship before the foundation of the world we don't need a meeting in order to try to fellowship together we came fellowshipping together we are fellowshipping together we don't need a meeting for differences how can we differ we are the children of god there's no way because we are part of him and christ is different you know there is a book here i don't know if it is here with me this is the revelation of jesus is christ for a certain class of people i mean it's not for everybody i see among the man and at this seventh seal is uh he says the only way the only way you will know him because we the bride knows him [Music] will be called out of the seventh church age record of that age the right now let's look this is the seventh h and uh and in this seventh he says the seals in their opening makuto because church ages speaks of time time frame if you go back there how are you going around the people fighting about that fighting pastors the bride is in christ [Music] and so that's why i'm reading here now we are now in the rapture that we have the rapture in faith [Applause] you know how the bible says enoch walked with god for how long 300 years ago all these 300 years and who is the other one elijah earlier the bible says he was with elijah elisha elisha then he called elisha richard elisha actually to beat him goodbye [Music] elijah for them to receive the mental which was called the holy ghost you will always leave a witness behind it i will give it to you you know on the other side of jordan elijah doesn't say god will give it to you but jesus will give god uh because god is descended and then he was in him all right so now that's why he said to elijah yeah alicia i because you know what what is it i can read you something quickly you know the lord says the prophet says after they came forth upon the earth at perfection words a so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was yes amen when god looked at the man of everything that he is you know you should know god okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll tell you something right now we were inside the room when he came for to come call me come on and he was talking about who's that today demand because as i told you yesterday so now then it was pointed to them i was busy looking we were busy looking at the word of god knowing that principles are not here to fear gaddafi gaddafi all [Applause] [Music] you are the muslim are you trying to win in christ the people who fought in heaven now and they have one is [Music] we want [Music] we are winning even now we are going to win amen so i read i want to worship in a church of this nature that is [Music] no he says did you see that he finally he has won he he has let me read it was a reflection of what his creator was brother he a is of what she wanted you to be uh somebody doubt says i can't be that thing i in his image what god wanted all right okay here now usually before we skip on we are talking about the rapture in faith our that's why you'll never see us involved in some meetings in trying to solve some quarrels and so forth will be called out of the 7th church shall never touch us we will be called out of the seven churches of that age now finally i'm going to read something here look it's about the system you know you you must say first to get to the nature of things we preach as preachers i'm going to read this part here yeah this is dealing with the gentiles i was looking for something but let's go to this uh [Music] and it shows a bunch all right let me take it from here uh you notice one more notice now no more for the end-of-time message you notice for the end of time message this seal amen which seal is this liquid yes after [Music] now even if you were trying to get to those things all things he has spoken about something there and it's so it is so difficult for the world to believe that we imagine i don't know if i've got the book i'll find it talking about the hour that we are living we are not even living in a certain hour uh when it starts will be absolutely a total secret before that remember at the end of the seventh angel's message it is this now the seventh season amen the end of the world now the first the owner of the seals it doesn't speak of the annihilation is actually the seals i would say is the message of the true fairness it doesn't go with the church ages times amen but he continues to say them seven thunders are turning themselves right close together you know the angels that came manila they were the interpretation it is we said last time revolutionary way you of the angels everything has changed his gospel has changed now in the constellation says 17 the celestial buddhism [Music] how god can drive put something down into their hearts to put them first in orbit that's why even today nothing unless you are in the constellation amen there is it is not a church you know before the foundation and god decided to put us into a body this one will not hear this message that the lord has revealed to us hallelujah let's look at it all right it says here when he was looking for an an interpretation but i have this book here hey this is wonderful books man do you read the message god bless you for doing that some people don't even bother to read the message they are busy with their cell phones s you know did you know that a vote saver your child knows more of the cell phone than you say because that is the fourth dimension it's keeping the people so busy amen there is no busy instruments in the world or an instrument that can keep men busy the whole day and night it is the cell phone cell phone keep him busy by a child school children can't even get time whenever school that's another trouble facebook [Applause] the people that want to see themselves more than they should see god there are some living now saying [Music] celebrity and that she's doing so now the reason she left she wanted to do it and then in the rapturing she couldn't they shall now i'm going to come with this like i say many things i uh i'll explain when chedding chickens are the saloon about to close house was all right uh to catch up with something here yeah this is it has started now to me when they shall start now forever tomorrow we've been trying to suppress river tomorrow mutual our savior cannot do anything i can see the rest then you ordered other things a new world order he says it will never do anything until the bride has left hospital did you know you are so safe satan can will do nothing saturn [Music] until who [Music] [Music] [Music] then what will happen is what the african nurse says it has started he said it to me now that shows that since the one challenge said something in this nature more about the immediately because instead of watching a football match i look at these things 1935 when a treaty was signed riverside a treat between russia and iran iran [Music] now will magog literature is just here you sit in the farm because you are watching today yeah people are when they open up the news and so forth java is to check these things if they can kill a all right they they they want money banana chili in the world today they kill for money holy why we should return here by god's grace it looks like god wouldn't want us to do it now he wants us to put another date what do we want to preach then it will show you down to jerusalem they appeared on monday this one all right it starts here a tomah we we i read that every day but before tempo you listen cheerleaders i don't know whether this one will differ with the one i've not differed not differ yeah i went west to kill [Music] before we close we are battling here i'll start here good night that is page five three four of my sales book here that's like a five one three four all the way back from the very beginning do you find it brother okay from the very beginning in genesis yes or no [Applause] all right i'm going to pick up this i'm watching my wrist to watch it brother why brother he went he was put into a constellation then he speaks of the pyramids of the angels is time you don't know he speaks of time but speaking about the angels he came to interpret the white okay now i'm looking at it before we can close at something here now did you from the very compared with the seventh sevens all right now that's why they could interpret their other things but they could not interpret the other things he interpreted the people are still waiting for it but what i mean all right here we are again from from genesis if you are standing there with me foreign now watch two things say definitely we will close out there's a did you find that one are we human oh sorry my brother sorry my brother keeping you busy hold here you know brother branham yes brother brennan right speaks about more profitable uh the the the end of time who fell overnight in this manner that's where i'd rather find it to myself you know when he says he said something in this manner [Music] uh eternity because that is just there i'm trying to pick up the page rather you bring it to me i will find it while i'm reading here okay let's let's look at this now can i read it all right i want to read this part here in your book do you know the book the book where brother brandon spoke of the new commission page 26 says this the time do you have second 26 he spoke about the new commission but that this new commission commissioning the angels do you have a wrong one the first one was given to him to yield the sick if you were now angels amen all right but i'm following something here do you have that book brother if not i can just quote it okay meanwhile let me read you this let's say find it brad that page in that i don't have all my books here sorry looked for a flying interpretation and liberty that's really fulfilling as he says one day when when [Music] no no no no no when it banged seven times i ever eat i saw something out of this seven so he kept on looking actually certainly until you get interpretation he was not supposed to to say i took place if you are listening to the tape of the of what time is he desired you will notice this is page five seven six give it a kind of five one seven six yeah uh we are winning national four we wanna get man i wanna share with the people yeah that they can read it the rest of them just seemed ordinarily came [Music] west sweeping towards with great terrible speech they picked me up you know you know that one you can't keep it running in your head there is no faculty i will not defeat you but listen tillage uh with great speech and they picked me up this this is angels that was coming back east the garden the headquarters of men was placed you know he planted [Music] that's why that's why he came back he came east that's where he was the king of the world the earth the prophet says god was the king was the god of the universe but he shared to his son also adam became a god of the earth from his headquarters called the garden of eden is given a sword will there are fewer churches that was mounted yeah we were standing there in the fire exactly where he received the sword and then he says the sword was in the garden when when remain in the middle of the keep in the middle well unappealing foreign i'm looking at this quickly um let me i know my mother used to go to this one my son was [Applause] here or not to say that your summary so you see under the new commission [Music] angels commissioner amen is no longer paul up to buddhist angels they are the earthly angels [Music] and they put him in a constellation and from that time okay [Music] in a ship how will somebody escape you don't take safety measures for massages [Music] if you are in christ how will the democracy you don't take measures you don't worry about the is greater than you in the world fasting is have you ever found somebody saying that the reason i left eternal life closing now listen to this third the third king is talking about [Music] now at that time the church is talking about it can be the very same church seven churches [Music] of the engines when you could perform the supernatural horn not in the church age this is the inside of the pyramid is [Applause] [Music] to the are you there you know you must change with the seasons yes the message today is not from a church age yes [Music] speaking of the bride we know she was called the church is called the bride but not he was not talking about just personal views he was talking [Music] another thing i want you to notice says the angel was very notable to me what does the word notable mean leno chibuna he was watching that one availability the rest of them just seemed ordinary but the angel remember noted one engine right [Music] ages was the mess and the only known to them this is referred to and now them was the messengers to and the angel was to my left or the seventh engine yeah my prophet he's talking about the seven engines we would count them from left to right [Music] he's got his head back and his great sharp wings that way the people get into trouble do you know where it says is but the angel came to him each keep it to you a [Music] [Applause] so let's keep what the lord has given to us [Applause] now i am saying um me and my brother here another one is sofa we've been working hard since we arrived here what was that one the secret of mount transfiguration security center have happened today but this one is just like that as you have hated it and yes [Music] god bless transfiguration
