[0:01] [Music]
[0:31] Now, let's turn to our Bibles.
[0:35] John 14 John 14. Um
[0:40] verse
[0:42] 20
[0:42] &gt;&gt; 20
[0:44] more verse 20.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; I am in my father and
[0:49] at that day you shall know that I am in
[0:52] my father and you in me and I in you.
[1:02] Revelation chapter 3
[1:05] verse 20- 21
[1:08] or rather 22.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:14] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:17] door, I will come into him and will s
[1:20] with him and he with me. To him who that
[1:25] overcomes will I grant to sit with me in
[1:29] my throne, even as I also overcame and
[1:33] am sat down with my father in his
[1:35] throne.
[1:55] Let us pray.
[1:59] Again, we come in this house for to
[2:02] worship the almighty God who created
[2:04] heaven and earth and who has chosen us
[2:08] before the foundation of the world so
[2:11] that we should be who we are. This
[2:13] morning
[2:14] &gt;&gt; we are praying believing that you are in
[2:17] our midst and also in us as you have
[2:20] promised that in the last days you'll
[2:23] come into us and uh we are believing
[2:27] that you'll heal every uh sick person in
[2:30] this house uh both physically and
[2:33] spiritually emotionally. And so we as we
[2:38] pray, we believe that you are here to
[2:40] deliver again the word uh to us in this
[2:44] end time in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; You may be seated for a while, the Lord
[2:51] willing, and
[2:54] now this morning I just want uh to pose
[2:57] for a photo with Christ.
[3:01] I want us to talk about being identified
[3:07] with Christ.
[3:12] Amen.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; And uh a brother just happened to uh
[3:20] give me this portion of the word
[3:25] when he asked a question
[3:28] but sincerely.
[3:30] So he said to me, "Who is this man who
[3:34] has put your face in the cloud?"
[3:40] But the brother was asking this in a
[3:44] very good mood.
[3:47] And I said to him,
[3:50] "Maybe I would not know, but what I
[3:53] believe that is his photo.
[4:02] something
[4:03] [Music]
[4:04] must have prompted him to uh put my face
[4:09] in that cloud.
[4:14] Now that is his photo.
[4:18] Amen. Amen. And uh and I said to the
[4:22] brother,
[4:24] uh I I believe that
[4:27] if
[4:29] I we can see Christ this to to Jesus
[4:32] this morning,
[4:35] everybody would want to pose a photo
[4:37] with him.
[4:41] Amen. Amen. I I believe it.
[4:46] So I believe for posing for a photo with
[4:49] Christ
[4:52] is a desire in every believer's heart.
[4:56] [Music]
[4:59] Now let's let's start now. Now now the
[5:02] subject here
[5:04] is being identified with Christ.
[5:08] Amen. Now I go to Congo and elsewhere.
[5:13] The brothers know
[5:15] [Music]
[5:16] last time we were in Cameroon in Congo,
[5:23] I I tried to run away from the brothers
[5:25] and sisters.
[5:28] They all want to pose for a photo with
[5:31] me
[5:33] just to identify themselves.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; You know, if um
[5:43] if somebody comes to this place
[5:47] &gt;&gt; and then maybe he's from somewhere else,
[5:51] I think all of us would want to post uh
[5:55] I mean to take a photo with him
[6:00] just in order to be identified.
[6:04] Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; With him.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, now I will read some
[6:08] something
[6:11] before the the brother is just working
[6:13] on a a small um diagram here.
[6:19] Now, you know, here we we've got some
[6:22] books.
[6:25] Now, the first man
[6:27] who actually had a desire to uh take a
[6:33] photo was God.
[6:38] Amen. Now as we say at that day you
[6:41] shall know that I am in you.
[6:47] That means I will identify myself
[6:52] and express myself
[6:55] in you.
[6:57] Amen. Go
[6:58] &gt;&gt; God likes that.
[7:00] He creates a thing
[7:03] and post for a photo with it.
[7:07] Amen. Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; He wants to be identified with his
[7:12] creation.
[7:16] That's why the Bible says he is the all
[7:19] and in all.
[7:23] Amen. He is identified with all.
[7:27] [Music]
[7:29] Now I read where the prophet says
[7:34] when Jesus was born
[7:37] the first people to receive the message
[7:39] were his subjects.
[7:47] That means the other people
[7:50] they receive the announcement from their
[7:53] subjects.
[7:57] Now the subject is the one who has the
[8:01] first information
[8:07] because he is part of the whole picture.
[8:12] That's why the Bible says in the book of
[8:14] Psalms
[8:16] and the seed shall serve him
[8:20] and shall declare to this generation
[8:24] he has done this
[8:27] only the seed
[8:30] and uh so now and and now the Bible
[8:33] again Galatians chapter 3 says
[8:38] &gt;&gt; uh Abraham's seed Abraham is Christ.
[8:43] Amen. Now,
[8:44] &gt;&gt; now we will read it.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; And now, that's why this morning
[8:49] I've been hearing people
[8:55] uh talking about it.
[8:58] Now, this time,
[9:04] now they've put face in the cloud.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:12] It's a a a a
[9:14] global outcry.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; About
[9:23] what's wrong with
[9:25] because he's just a human being.
[9:28] A sinner. A a a sinner saved by grace.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Saved by grace.
[9:37] I know.
[9:39] Amen. Amen. But now let's first here
[9:45] um
[9:46] now let's put the whole thing in a a
[9:50] center point
[9:53] and look at a man because the Bible says
[9:58] what is man
[10:01] [Applause]
[10:02] what is man
[10:05] now the first person
[10:08] &gt;&gt; to announce
[10:10] Uh this poor man like me
[10:14] was God himself.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; No, not the church, not who? Somebody
[10:23] else, but was now you must always
[10:28] make sure that
[10:31] [Music]
[10:33] you you what you the your identity
[10:39] is with God.
[10:42] So then you don't mind the other things
[10:45] coming from
[10:47] the circum coming by circumstances
[10:53] because you must be able to identify
[10:57] yourself
[11:00] with with God.
[11:02] Amen. Now this morning I want us to take
[11:05] a photo
[11:07] &gt;&gt; in the cloud.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Now I'll show you how you pose for a
[11:18] photo with that cloud.
[11:22] Amen.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you ask the people the Bible
[11:29] says
[11:30] he was taken up in a cloud.
[11:35] Amen.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; And the message believers believe that
[11:38] that cloud was the the souls the the
[11:41] people who had gone before.
[11:47] [Music]
[11:48] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] You say to them,
[11:55] &gt;&gt; uh, what was this cloud?
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Because we have some readers.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Now, they don't believe a thing unless
[12:07] they can read. They can read it.
[12:12] They believe the reading.
[12:16] But then the Bible says
[12:19] in the end time
[12:21] God will reveal
[12:24] &gt;&gt; the mysteries
[12:26] hid throughout the the the ages.
[12:32] Now that that thing is not something
[12:34] that you can read
[12:37] is the revelation of the word.
[12:40] [Music]
[12:42] Amen.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus says Who do men say that I, the
[12:46] son of man, am?
[12:49] Did Peter read?
[12:53] No, he couldn't read that.
[12:57] And yet, it's a question posed to him.
[13:01] He posted that question to the
[13:04] disciples.
[13:06] Amen. Amen. H Now, Peter and them,
[13:12] they they couldn't read that.
[13:17] until
[13:18] Peter
[13:21] uttered this words,
[13:23] &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ.
[13:27] Amen,
[13:28] &gt;&gt; son of the living God.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Now, if you have a revelation,
[13:34] he didn't say thou, thou art Jesus,
[13:39] &gt;&gt; because it is Jesus asking a question.
[13:44] [Applause]
[13:45] Now the the answer can't be thou art
[13:47] Jesus.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; If brother asked me a question,
[14:00] &gt;&gt; who do you men say that I
[14:03] am?
[14:07] The answer is not
[14:11] because it's asking the question.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Now
[14:22] men like the people of today
[14:26] uh some say you are Jeremiah, some say
[14:31] you are this.
[14:33] Some say we dealing with him. make
[14:35] yourself.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Some say
[14:39] some say you know but then he wanted to
[14:42] know who who then he turned to them
[14:46] who then do you say that I am.
[14:51] Amen. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Now who do men say I
[14:58] am?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; And who do you say that
[15:08] Amen.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; A prophet is not a prophet to the whole
[15:17] world.
[15:19] He's a prophet to a certain class of
[15:22] people.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; A pastor is not the pastor of all the
[15:28] the churches.
[15:33] He is a pastor to a certain class.
[15:38] Amen.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus said,
[15:42] "If they believe you,
[15:46] Amen. Amen."
[15:48] Now, let's read here. Now, God said in
[15:52] Genesis 1 verse 26, Genesis 126,
[15:56] &gt;&gt; "Let us make men in our image.
[16:02] You see
[16:04] &gt;&gt; and uh so he was starting to identify
[16:07] himself.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Let us make men in our image.
[16:14] Meaning that I want to see myself.
[16:19] Amen.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; How I look like.
[16:24] Amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; So now
[16:27] uh in seeing myself
[16:30] I should have somebody
[16:34] my resemblance
[16:38] &gt;&gt; so that I I won't have a problem looking
[16:41] at myself
[16:45] if you have a mirror.
[16:48] What does that mean?
[16:51] Because without a mirror you can't
[16:53] clearly see yourself. If you WANT TO SEE
[16:57] but with a mirror
[16:59] you you you see the people in the
[17:02] morning
[17:04] after dressing up they come before the
[17:07] mirror.
[17:09] Amen. Amen. Doing this
[17:14] &gt;&gt; because you can't see your face
[17:20] now. You must have an image.
[17:24] so that you can see how you look like.
[17:29] Now God also was the first one
[17:34] to be wanting to identify himself
[17:38] and see himself on a mirror
[17:42] now and his mirror is not like our
[17:46] mirror.
[17:48] His mirror should be a living mirror.
[17:53] Amen.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; So that this mirror can talk.
[17:57] [Music]
[17:58] &gt;&gt; This mirror can talk back to him
[18:03] so that he can also know
[18:06] how he speaks.
[18:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. You know your your
[18:15] man-made mirror
[18:18] can't walk, can't talk.
[18:22] So you you you don't know your voice.
[18:25] You can
[18:27] &gt;&gt; you don't hear yourself.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; It can speak. But God's mirror,
[18:34] God's image,
[18:37] it's like him.
[18:40] Amen. Amen. Now by that mirror,
[18:46] he can even send that mirror.
[18:50] Amen.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; To stand in his place.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[19:01] "If they hear you, they hear me." Amen.
[19:05] Amen.
[19:07] And they see you, they see me. Amen.
[19:11] Amen. Amen.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Now, let's see.
[19:17] Now that's God's mirror,
[19:20] &gt;&gt; his image.
[19:24] Even this morning, you are here to look
[19:28] at God's image.
[19:31] [Applause]
[19:34] The image that can stand for God.
[19:37] [Music]
[19:40] Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Not for a church,
[19:43] &gt;&gt; not for a group.
[19:46] [Applause]
[19:48] Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; What we need this morning
[19:54] &gt;&gt; um is God's image
[19:59] &gt;&gt; so that we can be able to identify
[20:02] ourselves.
[20:05] I I will read you something here.
[20:09] If I've got the book, I I will read it
[20:11] to you.
[20:14] You know this is what we need this
[20:15] morning
[20:18] men. Forgive me here.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; I must look for for my page here.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; It's somewhere else around here which I
[20:28] I would like to read to you.
[20:32] So just before we can pose for a photo.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Those who want to be identified
[20:44] Yeah, you know the book a the mighty God
[20:46] unveiled before us.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; That that is something else again.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; The mighty God
[20:54] unveiled.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Before
[21:00] not before the world,
[21:03] before us.
[21:05] Amen.
[21:07] Jesus appeared to some others
[21:11] and not to some others.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Page 26. The mighty God unveiled before
[21:24] us.
[21:26] Amen. Um
[21:29] to be a Christian
[21:32] I must stay identified where the word of
[21:36] God is being manifested.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us
[21:47] page 26
[21:49] paragraph 202.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 202. Amen.
[21:55] H maybe let me read it again so that now
[21:59] to be a Christian
[22:03] now a Christian
[22:05] &gt;&gt; it's a God
[22:08] God's indwelled being
[22:14] amen now it doesn't say to be a believer
[22:19] but to be a Christian
[22:23] okay Because the word believe
[22:28] &gt;&gt; can mean like this.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read it to you again. You
[22:33] listen. The word believer what it really
[22:36] means.
[22:40] Okay.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; You where's that book? I
[22:45] I will read it to you.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Um
[22:51] John chapter 8 verse 30.
[22:55] As he spoke these words, many believed
[22:57] on him.
[23:02] You see, now this doesn't mean faith.
[23:08] It's a believe
[23:12] like the people would say, you know, I
[23:16] believe when he says this, this, but
[23:18] when it comes to this, I don't take it.
[23:24] So that's a belief. That's not faith.
[23:28] You believe a certain statement and
[23:30] reject the next one.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now listen here that is John 8 29
[23:40] verse 30.
[23:42] As he spoke these words
[23:46] h many believed on him.
[23:51] So they believe the words.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Now God is
[23:59] &gt;&gt; the word
[24:03] but you can believe the words.
[24:08] Amen
[24:08] &gt;&gt; and still disbelieve the word.
[24:15] Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. you can believe some of
[24:18] the things I'm going to to speak about
[24:24] and reject the others.
[24:27] Now, that's five senses.
[24:30] That's not faith. Faith takes the word.
[24:36] Amen. Okay. Amen.
[24:39] Some of the people here
[24:42] when it comes to underworld and the
[24:44] things
[24:46] &gt;&gt; they say
[24:48] I say no here we don't agree with the
[24:50] pastoral
[24:55] how how can human being be
[24:58] &gt;&gt; if you don't know a thing just keep
[25:00] quiet
[25:05] amen Amen. Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; If you say this is not this,
[25:10] &gt;&gt; then you must be able to give us the
[25:12] answer.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; If you can't give the answer,
[25:19] &gt;&gt; then you know nothing.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[25:25] Then verse 31,
[25:27] &gt;&gt; then Jesus said to those Jews who
[25:29] believed on him,
[25:35] If you continue in my word
[25:40] now he didn't now he doesn't say in my
[25:43] words.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Then are you my disciples indeed?
[25:54] If you continue
[25:57] not in my words but in my word
[26:02] because the way God is the way.
[26:05] [Music]
[26:06] Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Not the words.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Verse
[26:15] 32.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 32.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; And you shall know the truth and the
[26:19] truth shall make you free.
[26:23] But he means if you continue in my word
[26:28] then are you my disciples.
[26:31] That means his disciples
[26:34] are not those who believe the words.
[26:39] But are are those who continue in in
[26:42] God?
[26:43] [Music]
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Because the words is not a complete
[26:51] thing.
[26:53] But the word
[26:55] &gt;&gt; is complete.
[26:58] Amen.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was not the words but
[27:01] the word
[27:04] and the word was God.
[27:07] [Music]
[27:09] Amen.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; It never said words.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Now
[27:15] verse
[27:17] 32. And you if you continue in my word,
[27:21] you shall know the truth and the truth
[27:23] shall make you free.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; The people who believed the words
[27:34] were not yet free.
[27:40] Even today there's some people who
[27:43] believed the words.
[27:47] They tell you
[27:50] the word
[27:53] but they don't believe the word
[27:57] because
[27:59] every time you identify yourself
[28:04] with God
[28:06] then there's an outcry.
[28:12] They believe in talking about the words
[28:14] the words the words the words
[28:17] But they don't believe the word.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; I'll show you here in the Bible.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Now here, here you are. Listen now.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Now h and if you shall know the truth
[28:32] only if you continue
[28:35] and the truth shall make you free.
[28:41] Then answer
[28:43] they answered him
[28:47] we are Abraham's seed
[28:51] &gt;&gt; right
[28:53] &gt;&gt; meaningh
[28:56] uh you must know that you are talking to
[28:58] Abraham seed
[29:03] Amen
[29:05] don't just take us us for granted
[29:10] &gt;&gt; yeah Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Must know that we are the message
[29:13] believers.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; We've got the spoken word spoken word.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Be careful
[29:24] when you speaking to us.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And we are never in bondage to any man.
[29:31] Yeah.
[29:35] We not under any man. Amen. How sayest
[29:38] thou you shall be made free?
[29:43] We are saved.
[29:47] We have received.
[29:51] How do you mean is free? Because we are
[29:52] free already.
[29:55] [Music]
[29:57] You are free in the denomination.
[30:01] Out of denominations, we are free.
[30:04] You be careful when you talking to.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus answered them, "Verily,
[30:09] verily, I say unto you, whosoever
[30:12] committed sin is the servant of sin."
[30:21] Sin of unbelief.
[30:24] Amen.
[30:26] Amen. Amen. Believing unbelievers.
[30:32] Amen.
[30:36] The thing is
[30:38] they want Jesus to speak to them the
[30:41] words
[30:44] but they they don't want himself to
[30:47] identify himself
[30:51] as the word.
[30:54] Amen. As knowing something,
[30:59] you know, they don't they just want him
[31:00] to preach about God.
[31:04] God is this. God God can do this. God,
[31:07] but they don't want him to take a
[31:10] picture with that God.
[31:14] Amen. Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; They don't want him to identify himself.
[31:21] Because that is the thing that e kindled
[31:25] anger in them.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; You are a man.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; You see, that that was their problem.
[31:34] You are a man. Now Jesus would always
[31:37] come and identify himself with GOD
[31:42] and say the father is in me.
[31:46] I am
[31:49] they said no no no no
[31:51] just speak the word.
[31:55] Don't identify yourself.
[31:58] The people today want you to talk about
[32:01] the prophet
[32:03] but they don't want you to identify
[32:05] yourself with the prophet.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; They don't want that.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; H you know the people they they think
[32:18] God is like the a king of Rwanda or
[32:23] somewhere else.
[32:27] You know, you've never seen Jesus
[32:31] &gt;&gt; in Jerusalem
[32:33] &gt;&gt; been driven around in a a a bulletproof
[32:36] carproofh
[32:43] disciples were not bodyguards.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; A king today
[32:54] to see him
[32:57] You have to be somewhere elsewhere
[33:01] &gt;&gt; because
[33:02] he's surrounded by bodyguards.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; The bulletproof what and else
[33:09] bulletproof
[33:11] &gt;&gt; but not Jesus.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Don't mistake the the disciples to be
[33:18] bodyguards.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[33:25] So this Jesus of mine,
[33:30] &gt;&gt; he he was just he was a man of men.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; He walked among the people,
[33:42] embraced children, and embraced the
[33:45] people.
[33:47] H visited the poor.
[33:50] He visited the sick.
[33:53] Amen. He was an ordinary citizen among
[33:57] the people
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] but with a extraordinary life.
[34:05] All right. This is the Jesus I know.
[34:09] It's a man you could meet and sit down
[34:11] with him and talk to him.
[34:15] You could you could ask him questions.
[34:19] Today if you come close to the king
[34:22] your security will
[34:27] you won't be allowed to shake his hand.
[34:32] Amen. Amen.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of security.
[34:40] So now this Jesus of mine
[34:43] &gt;&gt; is not a king
[34:46] &gt;&gt; uh who sat on a throne
[34:50] with people creating fresh air. I mean
[34:54] what we're doing feing him.
[34:58] No no that's not my Jesus.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; My Jesus was a man.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes he got hungry
[35:10] and in the process as they were coming
[35:15] and bankrupt.
[35:18] So he even cast a fig tree
[35:23] for failing to produce feed
[35:27] because he was hungry.
[35:29] That that is the Jesus I know.
[35:33] Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; It's not that he was not walking around
[35:38] with oil and water selling to the people
[35:44] selling to the people.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. That's not the one I know.
[35:50] The one I know
[35:52] is the word of God.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Now, in order to identify himself with
[36:03] me,
[36:05] He became me.
[36:10] Amen. That
[36:11] &gt;&gt; that's how God can identify himself.
[36:15] He became a man.
[36:18] Amen. And also he felt the infirmities.
[36:26] He got hungry and thirsty
[36:29] like me.
[36:32] Amen. Sometimes he was bankrupt
[36:35] like me because he post a photo with me.
[36:42] Amen. Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; He posed for a photo
[36:47] with He wanted to be a man.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. In order to be
[36:55] identified,
