[1:30:27] have a building of God and house not
[1:30:29] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:30:33] for in this we grow earnestly Desiring
[1:30:36] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:30:40] is from Heaven if so be that being
[1:30:43] clothed we shall not be found
[1:30:46] naked yes can you read also Revelation
[1:30:49] 21
[1:30:54] verse um 1 to 4 I think

[1:31:18] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[1:31:21] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:31:24] more see and I John saw the holy city
[1:31:27] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:31:30] of Heaven prepared as a bride Adon for
[1:31:33] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:31:36] out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:31:39] Tabernacle of God is with me and he will
[1:31:42] dwell with them and they shall be his
[1:31:44] people and God himself shall be with
[1:31:47] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[1:31:50] away all tears from their eyes and there
[1:31:52] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:31:56] nor crying praise God neither shall
[1:31:58] there be any more pain amen for the
[1:32:00] former things are pass away Hallelujah
[1:32:03] 24
[1:32:05] 24 the nations of them which are saved
[1:32:09] shall walk in the light of it and the
[1:32:12] kings of the earth who bring their Glory
[1:32:14] and Honor into
[1:32:16] it and the gates of it shall not be shut
[1:32:20] At All by day for there shall be no
[1:32:23] night
[1:32:25] amen let's close our
[1:32:28] eyes dear heavenly father thank you for
[1:32:32] this privilege here are your people who
[1:32:36] are standing in front of me that
[1:32:39] expecting something from
[1:32:42] our voices our mouth to come to them and
[1:32:47] to confy them amen give us something
[1:32:50] Lord we pray in the precious name of our
[1:32:53] Lord and Savior Jesus Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:55] amen we may take your seats brothers and
[1:33:04] sisters I'm going to just speak a little
[1:33:08] about
[1:33:11] bodies I and my sister we are going to
[1:33:15] put on when we pass from this amen
[1:33:25] so that you may
[1:33:29] know the Bible here
[1:33:33] says um when this early Tabernacle is
[1:33:43] dissolved let me say like
[1:33:46] this when this Tabernacle is
[1:33:52] dissolved I am my
[1:33:55] sister we have
[1:33:57] another
[1:34:05] tabern if you are living in a
[1:34:11] house when that house is
[1:34:15] dissolved is
[1:34:18] destroyed you have to go to another
[1:34:22] one but but you will go to another one
[1:34:25] if you have got another
[1:34:30] one but if you don't have another
[1:34:34] one then you are
[1:34:38] miserable we hear people we hear
[1:34:43] earthquakes and
[1:34:47] storms destroying
[1:34:51] houses and people cry out
[1:34:55] there saying our houses are
[1:34:59] destroyed in other words they don't have
[1:35:02] no way no other place to go
[1:35:06] to but according to the
[1:35:09] B Paul
[1:35:11] says when this tacle of
[1:35:19] ours we have got another one
[1:35:23] R
[1:35:25] waiting you cannot have a a
[1:35:29] house if you have not built
[1:35:33] it or if you have not bought
[1:35:36] it and if you have not applied for
[1:35:40] it there must be some
[1:35:44] system that must be
[1:35:47] followed before you can have another
[1:35:51] house because before you can have this
[1:35:54] one there were some certain
[1:35:58] systems that brought you to this
[1:36:01] one and there must be another
[1:36:05] system so that it can BR you to another
[1:36:09] house but if you have not undergone that
[1:36:14] system don't don't don't try to tell us
[1:36:17] that you have got another
[1:36:20] one but if those who have got another
[1:36:22] one
[1:36:25] when they say we have got another
[1:36:28] house they know they have undergone some
[1:36:33] syst they know they have applied for
[1:36:35] that
[1:36:36] house they know they of
[1:36:40] house they don't just say I got
[1:36:44] house they
[1:36:50] don't are you together with
[1:36:54] that is the
[1:36:55] truth the Bible says so
[1:36:58] here then
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:05] anly is a
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:10] body is this one and if if anly
[1:37:14] Tabernacle is this
[1:37:17] one in other words I have another body
[1:37:21] like this one
[1:37:25] when this one is
[1:37:27] dissolved that is how Paul is telling
[1:37:29] me that is how I telling
[1:37:33] you I know about
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:39] that to have this
[1:37:42] one all of you you
[1:37:45] know that we are all
[1:37:50] born we are born to have this body
[1:37:55] no one has this
[1:37:57] body without undergoing
[1:38:02] birth we are born all of
[1:38:06] us then we have
[1:38:08] this so to have another
[1:38:11] body you must be
[1:38:15] born you cannot have a body without
[1:38:21] B that's why Jesus told
[1:38:25] neod you must be born
[1:38:29] again so that you can have another
[1:38:35] tabernac you must be born
[1:38:38] again we have the Bible says here Peter
[1:38:44] says You must be
[1:38:47] born by a new
[1:38:51] seat which is not
[1:38:55] corruptable which is the word of
[1:38:58] God to be born
[1:39:01] again to have another
[1:39:04] Tabernacle you must be born
[1:39:08] again to be born again according to the
[1:39:12] Bible you must be born by the
[1:39:16] way you must be born by the
[1:39:20] seed and the seed which is the word of
[1:39:23] God
[1:39:25] and the word we have
[1:39:26] said the way travel through the
[1:39:30] body the word from
[1:39:33] God to the vision
[1:39:36] Mary through the
[1:39:38] Angel God sent the angel and gave the
[1:39:42] angel the
[1:39:45] seed and the angel went to Mar with the
[1:39:50] seed and the angel brought the seed to
[1:39:55] Mary the word spoken by the angel to
[1:40:00] Mary come the blood in the womb
[1:40:07] ofy the word was brought by the
[1:40:12] angel to
[1:40:16] Philip was brought to
[1:40:19] Philip Philip carried the seed
[1:40:23] to the
[1:40:25] UN so that they can be
[1:40:29] Bel to have
[1:40:31] Bel there must be a
[1:40:36] seat amen
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:49] amen you
[1:40:51] obtain this
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:56] through the
[1:40:58] seat let me say I don't want to go
[1:41:02] deeper in this
[1:41:04] one there must be an
[1:41:09] angel which must bring the
[1:41:14] SE to the
[1:41:16] woman in the end
[1:41:19] time there is a a vision
[1:41:24] which received the
[1:41:26] SE who has made the
[1:41:29] angel who is
[1:41:32] that this
[1:41:38] one she met the
[1:41:41] angel I may witness for
[1:41:44] that she met the
[1:41:47] [Applause]
[1:41:51] angel let let me say this going to go
[1:41:56] far so that you cannot be angry with
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:04] me
[1:42:05] because you are impatient I
[1:42:18] know people want to hear stories
[1:42:23] when it comes to the way
[1:42:25] of
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:32] always I'm not going to waste your
[1:42:36] time we have got types of
[1:42:39] bodies because this is a
[1:42:42] body as the Bible says PA says so he
[1:42:47] says we have got different type
[1:42:49] of he said you have got anly body
[1:42:54] and we have got Heavenly
[1:42:55] Body that is what Paul
[1:42:58] said we have got this one this is called
[1:43:01] a terrestrial
[1:43:04] body and this body belongs
[1:43:09] here and it ends
[1:43:14] here then we have got another
[1:43:17] one the second one which is called the
[1:43:21] the theop
[1:43:24] a Celestial
[1:43:26] one this
[1:43:29] theop belongs to another
[1:43:33] dimension it does not belong to this
[1:43:37] one it is belongs to another
[1:43:40] dimension but if you are born
[1:43:44] again when you die from
[1:43:46] here you go to that one because it's
[1:43:50] another
[1:43:54] amen but it's for those who are born
[1:44:00] again when the new bed start to grow in
[1:44:04] you in
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:07] you there is another body been formed
[1:44:14] somewhere that is how the man of God
[1:44:18] says the Bible
[1:44:20] says and that body is a
[1:44:25] when you die
[1:44:27] here being the child of God if you have
[1:44:31] applied for this
[1:44:33] house if you have
[1:44:37] got that that that house is called
[1:44:41] theop then you go to that
[1:44:46] house are you together with me I
[1:44:50] believe that my sister now
[1:44:55] he is in that
[1:44:57] house amen he's together with
[1:45:02] others some are from the Old
[1:45:06] Testament they are there in that
[1:45:11] Buddhist when
[1:45:13] Jesus rise
[1:45:16] up according to the
[1:45:18] scripture those old Saints there
[1:45:23] rose up
[1:45:25] with they move he went to
[1:45:28] Paradise because he went first to
[1:45:33] hell to to take the keys to from
[1:45:38] Satan and open
[1:45:41] Paradise when you open
[1:45:44] Paradise the Saints in Paradise saw
[1:45:48] him each and every one of them praise
