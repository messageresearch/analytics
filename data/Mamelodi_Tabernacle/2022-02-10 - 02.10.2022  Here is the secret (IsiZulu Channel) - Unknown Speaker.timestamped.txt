[2:34:55] you know that in the bible
[2:34:58] let me
[2:35:00] rewind this
[2:35:02] the Bible says
[2:35:06] in the beginning was the word
[2:35:11] was with God
[2:35:14] was God then it says and there was a man
[2:35:18] sent from God
[2:35:22] I think we said yesterday not sent by
[2:35:26] God
[2:35:29] and this man sent by God
[2:35:33] from God
[2:35:34] meaning he is part of the word
[2:35:39] when he was asked to address himself
[2:35:45] he said yeah I am the voice of one
[2:35:49] crying in the wilderness
[2:35:51] [Music]
[2:35:55] because he knew himself to be that
[2:35:59] scripture
[2:36:03] believe that today
[2:36:06] me by the time we will believe in this
[2:36:09] place
[2:36:15] that we are a scripture
[2:36:20] we are the scriptures
[2:36:24] now the message
[2:36:27] the messenger was sent
[2:36:30] to preach
[2:36:32] foreign
[2:36:46] right no other
[2:36:50] form of life can believe the words
[2:37:02] now I I will read here uh
[2:37:09] this is this book here
[2:37:12] it says it
[2:37:16] speaks of
[2:37:18] the cycle of Eternity
[2:37:22] in English and this is
[2:37:26] the future home of the bride and the
[2:37:29] bridegroom in what in the future page 29
[2:37:33] says
[2:37:34] you can't find no Corner
[2:37:39] eternity is like a ring
[2:37:43] you can't find nobody to listen
[2:37:50] you can't find no stopping place I will
[2:37:54] call him
[2:37:56] if you are a son or a daughter of God
[2:38:02] since he has called you you can't stop
[2:38:09] Maybe
[2:38:10] because
[2:38:12] you are in a cycle
[2:38:17] and you know in this cycle
[2:38:19] let me try it again
[2:38:23] and when
[2:38:25] Adam forfeited because God and men were
[2:38:29] one
[2:38:34] I can get it for you in the book Christ
[2:38:37] is the mystery of God revealed
[2:38:41] where it says
[2:38:43] revealed this is God's mystery
[2:38:48] God and men were one yeah
[2:38:56] if you were one with God you'll say Amen
[2:38:59] to that
[2:39:00] um
[2:39:03] it's a secret
[2:39:05] that's why it says the word is where
[2:39:10] in the bride now I can't go around
[2:39:14] trying to find a place for me to worship
[2:39:18] because the word is where and what's
[2:39:20] good
[2:39:23] is really give me amen amen we are not
[2:39:28] searching as if we are not looking for
[2:39:31] something as a phoning for because the
[2:39:34] secret here is

[2:40:35] anything that started in eternity
[2:40:39] has no stopping place
[2:40:48] my brother
[2:40:49] I'm looking for
[2:40:51] that cycle and
[2:40:59] I think today
[2:41:02] I have occupied a greater place here
[2:41:08] again in the book
[2:41:14] it is in the same book
[2:41:18] because we have this
[2:41:22] book Perfection perfection
[2:41:26] in the book Perfection we realize that
[2:41:29] God
[2:41:31] there is a cycle here
[2:41:34] perfectionist
[2:41:36] the top part it says
[2:41:42] and the bottom part says men laying a
[2:41:48] pants
[2:41:55] all right
[2:41:58] earn
[2:42:00] s-i-m
[2:42:04] I didn't have
[2:42:06] time to sit with the brothers here
[2:42:08] is
[2:42:16] the beginning
[2:42:20] s e is at the ending
[2:42:28] and as he was
[2:42:31] at the beginning
[2:42:33] foreign
[2:42:38] God is endless
[2:42:40] like
[2:42:44] eternity
[2:42:47] unlike Satan
[2:42:50] Ina let me tell you about Satan
[2:42:54] Revelation 12
[2:42:56] verse 12.
[2:43:02] 12 10 to 12.

[2:43:09] now this comes salvation and strength in
[2:43:12] the Kingdom of our God and the power of
[2:43:15] this Christ I think Israel is
[2:43:42] brother Branham telling you about that
[2:43:45] part

[2:43:51] them

[2:44:12] [Music]
[2:44:33] amen he knows that his time is
[2:44:41] cornered

[2:45:01] if the sons of God come are coming
[2:45:04] together

[2:45:29] [Music]
[2:45:30] and I also know that
[2:45:34] the time of the Rapture is
[2:45:37] just here
[2:45:41] Satan also knows that he is short
[2:45:46] foreign
[2:45:50] [Music]
[2:45:51] what did it say about you those the
[2:45:54] Dwellers of the earth and the
[2:45:57] whoa eating Maya

[2:46:06] tribulation
[2:46:08] which is three and a half years Satan
[2:46:20] foreign and even now put in a man who is
[2:46:24] they he is preparing he has lungs for
[2:46:29] that

[2:47:01] nothing shall touch that bride
[2:47:07] amen and the bride believes that we are
[2:47:10] called
[2:47:12] when the men of sin shall come in
[2:47:19] he will never be successful while the
[2:47:22] bride of Christ is here
[2:47:29] Christ will take his bride first who
[2:47:32] Christ
[2:47:35] then hell is on Earth there is a system
[2:47:40] and the Dwellers of the sea
[2:47:42] on Earth
[2:47:50] they operate from the sea and all those
[2:47:52] things
[2:48:03] because in that new Heaven and Earth
[2:48:11] [Applause]
[2:48:16] that's why you see today
[2:48:19] go to Every Church you find water now
[2:48:23] that is
[2:48:30] amen because water is going to burn
[2:48:36] the fires of God
[2:48:42] to clean the Earth
[2:48:52] now we are here let me look at it
[2:48:57] uh no
[2:49:00] I I could yeah
[2:49:04] you can find no
[2:49:11] eternity
[2:49:12] if I know never find the corner of a
[2:49:16] perfect cycle
[2:49:22] infection
[2:49:24] you could run and run through ages
[2:49:35] that's never I could never say there
[2:49:39] will never never be an end to it
[2:49:45] and that's the way God is
[2:49:49] and when
[2:49:52] and God which always was yeah
[2:50:01] perfect okay to begin with
[2:50:04] we will always be the same
[2:50:07] he never can change
[2:50:15] now this great chain of perfection are
[2:50:20] called The Chain was broken by time
[2:50:22] space
[2:50:24] because
[2:50:30] but it says
[2:50:34] there came the space of time
[2:50:38] this strange great chain
[2:50:41] s
[2:50:48] and there was broken by this time space
[2:50:54] that's why now if you can look at it now
[2:51:01] has gone beyond time
[2:51:05] no more ages to the bride is
[2:51:09] [Music]
[2:51:16] still funny
[2:51:20] that is now
[2:51:22] in the rooms
[2:51:26] the Angels that's why
[2:51:29] the constellation is none of the Angels
[2:51:48] now let me read you something here about
[2:51:51] this uh what happened with this
[2:51:54] constellation
[2:51:56] um
[2:52:03] I hope it doesn't happen again let me
[2:52:06] look at this
[2:52:10] uh brother I'm looking for this book
[2:52:13] here will help me to find it loud
[2:52:18] standing in the Gap standing in the game
[2:52:24] yes I had it here with me
[2:52:29] Perhaps it is this one yes yes thank you
[2:52:33] brother
[2:52:34] okay let me check something here
[2:52:40] standing in the cabin
[2:52:43] is that page 20.
[2:52:47] I saw seven angels
[2:52:54] in a form of a pyramid
[2:53:00] many places about the Pyramid of angels
[2:53:07] and you see even the pyramid
[2:53:28] the prophet said to the people in that
[2:53:31] great vision Prophet
[2:53:35] is
[2:53:43] but as the time goes on what is the
[2:53:48] people left one by one
[2:53:52] because there was no response
[2:53:57] to some other people but to the other
[2:54:01] people
[2:54:02] still looking inside
[2:54:07] because that was beyond time
[2:54:16] is because there was something they
[2:54:18] could see
[2:54:21] those who remain with Christ
[2:54:24] they said where shall we go
[2:54:30] eternal life
[2:54:33] there's something that they saw that
[2:54:36] kept them rallied around him
[2:54:39] because of the words of eternal life
[2:54:47] something keeping us
[2:54:51] because we have seen the words of
[2:54:54] eternal life
[2:54:58] was even crucified
[2:55:03] [Music]
[2:55:32] the predestinated
[2:55:35] himself
[2:55:54] okay
[2:55:56] I wanted to be sorry to put it that way
[2:55:58] but no no I'm not sorry
[2:56:07] God's word when he is
[2:56:13] so the words of eternal life
[2:56:17] where in Jesus
[2:56:25] Peter saw that
[2:56:29] and
[2:56:31] he even today he is with Jesus
[2:56:39] foreign
[2:56:47] I saw seven angels that descending in
[2:56:50] the Gap
[2:56:53] I don't know if we can reach that place
[2:57:02] amen amen I've asked many a time which
[2:57:07] game
[2:57:12] the sun forfeited the book yeah foreign
[2:57:34] no
[2:57:37] all
[2:57:39] these ages
[2:57:43] the battle is just for one thing
[2:57:47] since God cannot be defeated
[2:58:03] now where is something
[2:58:08] whether it will receive amen or not but
[2:58:11] here is something here um
[2:58:18] and in this book Perfection
[2:58:20] Perfection the prophet says
[2:58:23] the Lord Jesus which is came and
[2:58:26] sprinkled blood where's luck
[2:58:32] from this side of the Gap
[2:58:37] [Applause]
[2:58:39] because
[2:58:41] for the Redemption of Adam
[2:58:45] that place
[2:58:47] did not belong to the cherubim
[2:58:50] it belonged to men
[2:58:58] he was there at the gate
[2:59:02] but when he fulfated the book God to
[2:59:05] tell me God drove them out of the garden
[2:59:10] and so he put some cherubim
[2:59:18] but cherubim
[2:59:21] stood therefore in case in in state of
[2:59:25] Adam
[2:59:29] that's the place of men says
[2:59:44] so the game
[2:59:51] no this one
[2:59:53] it will take a real real amen from a
[2:59:58] theophany
[3:00:06] firstly listen I saw seven angels in a
[3:00:10] form of a pyramid is
[3:00:17] [Music]
[3:00:25] step down and pick me up
[3:00:30] this is
[3:00:32] the second
[3:00:37] commission best commission
[3:00:43] preach the weight
[3:00:45] is was the angels from eternity
[3:00:54] amen amen so it was a pyramid
[3:00:59] foreign
[3:01:05] I saw seven angels
[3:01:08] in the form of a pyramid yeah
[3:01:19] the pyramid
[3:01:22] seven steps to God
[3:01:30] all right amen
[3:01:34] then as we come to the seventh step she
[3:01:38] says
[3:01:45] you can enter the New Jerusalem without
[3:01:48] meeting the king first our words
[3:02:00] maker and Builder is God
[3:02:04] Abraham knew that there is
[3:02:11] God and the Bible

[4:37:37] I think somebody will say I will never
[4:37:41] be the same again
[4:37:46] [Applause]
[4:37:49] if we rewind back to hear that voice
[4:37:52] crying out
[4:37:55] before there was anything
[4:37:58] said let there be light
[4:38:02] is still the same voice
[4:38:16] and I was like
[4:38:20] [Music]
[4:38:26] and they wanted to make men
[4:38:30] in your own image
[4:38:35] here we are
[4:38:37] in your image
[4:38:41] [Music]
[4:38:42] we are here to worship you thank you and
[4:38:46] say
[4:38:47] no one is Lefty
[4:38:52] [Music]
[4:38:54] there's some people here
[4:38:57] who has have never met you
[4:39:04] will this be
[4:39:06] an opportunity
[4:39:09] to these people to say in this dying
[4:39:13] moments of the history of this world
[4:39:16] every time I'm walking around
[4:39:20] I say to myself I'm looking to these
[4:39:23] things for the last time
[4:39:28] I shall never see them again
[4:39:34] there is a country
[4:39:37] when Abraham
[4:39:40] and their seed
[4:39:42] they started off in my migration
[4:39:47] looking for a city
[4:39:50] they knew that
[4:39:55] this city somewhere
[4:40:03] here we are Lord as the Seed of Abraham
[4:40:07] in migration
[4:40:09] we know that there's a city somewhere
[4:40:13] whose maker
[4:40:15] and Builder is God
[4:40:21] and you have sent
[4:40:24] the messenger
[4:40:28] we recognized him
[4:40:32] for you are sent to us
[4:40:35] we knew him we recognize him
[4:40:39] for we all came from the same place
[4:40:42] as brother Branham says men and God came
[4:40:46] from the same place
[4:40:48] and I believe that
[4:40:51] I believe that men and God came from the
[4:40:54] same place
[4:40:58] that's why
[4:40:59] we worship them
[4:41:02] bless
[4:41:03] the souls here Lord God
[4:41:08] some came in here
[4:41:11] not in a good mood some sick
[4:41:15] but let the hand of the Lord
[4:41:20] touch them
[4:41:24] touching each and every one
[4:41:29] father
[4:41:31] we know that one day
[4:41:34] we are thinking of that every
[4:41:39] day every moment
[4:41:43] my mind is flooded with that day
[4:41:48] when you shall come in the air
[4:41:55] after this trumpet has sounded
[4:42:00] we are watching
[4:42:02] that one day
[4:42:05] there will be a sound
[4:42:09] and here he will be standing in the air
[4:42:14] then
[4:42:17] we shall put off these bodies
