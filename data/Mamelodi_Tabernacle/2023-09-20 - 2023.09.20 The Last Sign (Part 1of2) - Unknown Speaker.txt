made yes [Music] amen amen now I think we will we will come to terms that the place of God is the heart of man amen [Music] will come to terms with that fact that here that position of God is in a place [Music] men in them now in the Tabernacle there is a place there was a place in the oldest man called a holy of holies foreign [Music] [Music] you must know where God is because God is an object of worship [Music] amen now those who worship their son they look at the Sun [Music] those who worship a certain statues they come involved before the stage [Music] now those who worship God save the other till they come to where it is he has to identify himself if do I remember sit on TV where the Lord Jesus Christ is many First Steps [Music] not only where the uh where the peoples talk about him you know you you find a place where the people will talk about God that's why you find differences [Music] a worshiper will go walk past that place if you're not the wrong dude God is not a water of confusion so if I come to a place I realize that people are talking about God then I know that is not the place is when he is manifested where he is manifested love is when he is made known now he then manifestation amen that's how we worship God [Music] [Music] because as we said yesterday since the mystery of God is not in the book [Music] you know I during the time of services the Philistine they couldn't see the mystery the Improvement of his power the selfishness amen [Music] they knew that is since after they couldn't find the mystery come again since then couldn't find the mystery or see London and they picked up a woman his own private Farm Amen to pull out the Mysteries and like like we can put on long dresses [Music] [Music] this is God's Great history the mystery of Love expression [Music] um that one thing is God and the man the whole thing is that means the whole Mysteries [Music] and God and man was one two alone and God and man is one year children [Music] [Music] [Music] he says and when God formed men could do it from alone and it was a perfect reflection reflection perfect on the highest in heaven Hallelujah when God made men it was a perfect reflection sitting in perfect reflection you know God wanted to be reflected amen now for for God to be reflected reflectively [Music] and the Soul as he said let us make men in our image now that's why that's why we as the children of God you come and found that you will be looking for a man no regarding person a man who will resemble God is amen now if you are looking for God you will find God when you find a man that looks like God [Music] [Music] but she wanted something on Earth to reflect him in on Earth now God needed something to reflect him on Earth it was a perfect reflection of the highest perfect reflections and [Music] which was which little God is a man [Music] God it is okay and some people fear that and certain personal business [Applause] [Music] speaking the prophet speaking okay

of the church the message is but now they know we will read it it is he speaks out of men now he is speaking out of me amen and if if I pick up one of the things here I see your pancake facility see their Prophet says again the prophetic and the unity of one God in the one Church please like this is the spoke anyway now he says when God comes to a man I know he comes to his heart even if amen amen amen now we are talking about the coming of the Lord all the denominations are talking about the coming of the Lord now when God comes to a man he comes to his activity amen and we are talking about the coming of the Lord now that's why the seventh seals Prophet says brought him down to Earth because when God comes to a man yes everybody [Music] okay [Applause] now it's something like this is French men Francaise that's me and I will say um this is Jesus is the Christ electricity reversing right it is now in may we have what we call them soon [Music] what's that yes that's correct okay now Jesus Jesus [Music] he cannot come into you in Peppa as a man come on [Music] twister amen amen to your soul because man has only five senses he can't come to you amen [Music] now that is [Music] [Music] now Christ Feast is what was in Jesus [Music] the Pharisees could see Jesus Christ that's the difference that's that's why the people can't see the seventh seeds they can see amenities [Music]

[Music] another person amen amen all right it is what we call that the soul since the soul is in the heart the soul is not the heart the soul is in their heart and just like Christ second Christian Christ was in the men Jesus amen and in me and you is the soul now let's read about it and in your mind don't occur there is another person Paul calls him the inner men long interior the inner men in
