TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Make sure that the road you have is God's role. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a miracle worker. &gt;&gt; Moses made sure that he had a rod in possession because that rod was responsible for opening of the sea. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah knew it. &gt;&gt; He had the mantle. &gt;&gt; Elisha knew it. The church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She had the mental now. She I mean church now. He knew that without that mental he would never perform. He will only reside. &gt;&gt; So he put his son &gt;&gt; Adam and bride in that headquarters. So Adam was in the headquarters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what happened? &gt;&gt; And uh there was this man without the garden, &gt;&gt; a revivalist, &gt;&gt; he had his open air meeting there. So because now the the the headquarters were well guarded. So he he just walked around this way and that way. &gt;&gt; He would look at Adam. He was blinded because that was the original seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he would move down up there and checking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he's doing that like a lion &gt;&gt; of the tribe of Cain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember even when you are asleep &gt;&gt; the devil is just about &gt;&gt; but the pillar of light is there. &gt;&gt; He won't touch you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; that was the garden of Eden. Adam meant that place. &gt;&gt; He was a god there. &gt;&gt; So now the serpent, &gt;&gt; Lucifer's prophet. &gt;&gt; So it came there came there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and until &gt;&gt; the church &gt;&gt; was found being alone. &gt;&gt; Naturally, you know that if a woman goes down the street alone, you know that whistling whistling hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if she happens to go down to be going down with her husband, &gt;&gt; do you hear any whistling? Amen. &gt;&gt; The serpent will always wait for a chance to find her alone. Don't worry, sister. You say I'm single. &gt;&gt; You say I'm single. &gt;&gt; No, you are married to Christ. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about natural things outside. Even brother Brennham says you are not seeing it. The pastor is your husband. &gt;&gt; But I mean spiritually. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; So in Christ you are not single. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are not yet married, &gt;&gt; your marriage is coming. They that wait upon the Lord, &gt;&gt; they shall receive the their marriage and their blessings. &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord. Waiting upon the Lord means gaining experience in God. The more you wait, the more you are spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you you you have to keep your title a young man, a young woman. I said this in Botswana. to remember how to be a Christian is to be a champion. &gt;&gt; Now a champion harder than any other if we talk of boxing boxer &gt;&gt; because all the other boxers are they want that belt &gt;&gt; they are looking at the belt &gt;&gt; your belt once you are a Christian that means you are a champion of all hell and the demons looking at the belt at your belt now After you have won, then you must keep. Some people sometimes they score and win to lose it again and say, you know, I used to rejoice in the Lord. You know, I used to the the prophet says, God don't have exchildren. [Music] Once a child of God, you're a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible puts it better than me. It says we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; That means that there's con there is some conquerors. But the Bible says we are more than that. &gt;&gt; We don't even consider that level for we are more than that &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a champion [Music] &gt;&gt; he sweats day and night to retain that's a Christian day and night she or he fights to retain &gt;&gt; the belt is Let's look at these gods now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now after Satan m the system the prophet now says then there was a gap. &gt;&gt; Can I read that part again pastor? Then there was a game. &gt;&gt; The past partner was no longer in his position. &gt;&gt; Then it caused God to make a plan. &gt;&gt; Plan for what now? Our position is not just to quit smoking and that is nothing. &gt;&gt; When you were born you were not smoking. You are not drinking. So to quit smoking and drinking is nothing compared to the quality that we are made of. &gt;&gt; It is like maybe you are smoking and somebody tells you that you are a child of God you are a child of God. Then you say, "Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; It's nothing. &gt;&gt; When you were born, you are not smoking." &gt;&gt; Now, if sometimes in the denomination, a person comes and quits smoking, then he says, "No, she's he's just a non-smoker. The devil is so cunning. He knows the levels. We are we are not nonsmokers and non drinkers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Sometimes people take the word of God to be a good policy. Just a good policy, not really what it meant." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God came to make us God. But &gt;&gt; let me reverse this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God &gt;&gt; came to confirm because brother Brennham says have eternal life always ahead. He says only it's like this. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe I've got the book here. &gt;&gt; Who is this mechisedc? Let me read this partage 11. &gt;&gt; Those who have tonight eternal life. No, no, this morning. Those who have this morning eternal life were with him and in his mind before there was an angel star or cherub that's why we are going there. When Adam left the place, &gt;&gt; the cherubim stood guard there guarding the way of the tree of now. We all know that the place belong to Adam. But after God drove them out, he put cherabim with a sword to guard the way of the tree of life. Now I know that this morning God gave back. &gt;&gt; God brought Amen. &gt;&gt; The man &gt;&gt; to the place [Music] says &gt;&gt; we have seven angels leading back to the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Now you come to the seventh. &gt;&gt; He's standing there with a sword. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you are looking at this thing geographically. Leave it geographically. The cherubims were there. But today, God gave the end time messenger and said this is the sword of the king. Now we can say every time you see the source man you should know that behind that source man is God's mysteries. &gt;&gt; So he restored that. Let's come down this way. H I'm reading this part here. Oh yeah. Yeah. Uh who is this Melkisedc? &gt;&gt; The prophet says something here. &gt;&gt; Uh he says &gt;&gt; look unless you you are a thought at the beginning for he says you can't be a word unless you were Then it solves our pro our problems. You can't be a word unless you were a thought. So it solves our problems. &gt;&gt; The people don't believe because the prophet says they were not there. they were not in his. &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brenham says some of the things were not there you know how they came as plagues and what else thorns were not there but after sin thorns started to &gt;&gt; and he says in the garden in the field they so much looked alike some were not planted by the father they will be rooted they were not So my problem is solved today. &gt;&gt; I believe because I was there. You believe because you were [Music] that proves the predestinated of God. You can't be the word unless you are a thought. But you see, in order to stand temptation, you had to bypass the theophony. You had to come down here. Now, brother Brennham says &gt;&gt; this theophony that's where we lived before. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then God, he had to bring us down here to bypass our theophony, come down here in flesh to be tempted. And now although I don't have the papers here but I can say let me look at this. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says let me just quote it. You are here in the negative showing that if there is a negative show that somewhere there's a positive this body is the negative. You can read it. Masterpiece page three. We realize that we are here in the negative. and realizing that if there's a negative positive and if you process the negative positive now this also can solve this solved my problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For it says, &gt;&gt; yeah, I've got this part here, &gt;&gt; the negative. &gt;&gt; There has to be an object somewhere. When the light strikes that lens and uh so I'll take it from here. So when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we are in the image of some life somewhere for the prophet says each and every one of us is influenced from up or from down. from up or from beneath. We are all being influenced. What influences you just to think of God and one God all the time? Something from above. And what influences somebody just to to be after sin, something from beneath? We are influenced from. So he says that we know that there is a positive somewhere somewhere beyond the blue for me. Amen. And the light has struck and it reflect something here and we are only that reflection. A genuine object is somewhere. Amen. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says &gt;&gt; after the fall, &gt;&gt; I asked the pastor to read this again. What happened after the fall? &gt;&gt; Then Adam left a gap. Now we can understand all this about standing in the gap. [Music] Adam left a gap there. &gt;&gt; It cost God something &gt;&gt; because one part left the place. He had to come through the laws. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all these shadows and so forth. in order to bring it back again. The whole ministry bring Adam back to them where God would be able again to run his Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if maybe your radio maybe you don't hear from the studio blame the studio it's your radio you turn on And you see now you see those people now. &gt;&gt; It's not the studio. It's your radio. Now what you need to fix, &gt;&gt; the receiver here, your radio. &gt;&gt; So that's why God, he knew that the problem is not with the studio, &gt;&gt; but with the receiver down there. receiver. So he came back, fixed the receiver. Then after he fixed the receiver, he went back and started again. &gt;&gt; You know, he tried it there with seven church ages. And the seventh man &gt;&gt; received the receiver receiver. &gt;&gt; And the Lord started again. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's working now. &gt;&gt; The first church age is Amen. &gt;&gt; He was receiving a response now. &gt;&gt; How how many are here? [Music] &gt;&gt; Now the the prophet says, "I've got this book again. Tomorrow I'm going to read it again. Now this great chain of perfection was broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The chain of perfection. God on this side, another God on that side. One side was broken &gt;&gt; and the studio. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Broadcast was still broadcasting and there was the receiver was quiet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All quiet there. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Where are you? &gt;&gt; I can't I can't hear you. &gt;&gt; Where are you? &gt;&gt; Finally, he cornered him. And he said, &gt;&gt; "It's this woman." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She made me quit the post. &gt;&gt; And remember, &gt;&gt; God never made arguments with Adam. He said, "It's this woman. &gt;&gt; He made me to do it." &gt;&gt; And God never made an argument. &gt;&gt; Then he said, &gt;&gt; "Okay, woman is the serpent." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they were pointing behind them. Is this woman? The woman says is this serpent? And God never said anything to the serpent. He never asked him anything. He knew that he was going to tell lies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He only ex executed judgment on him &gt;&gt; from today. &gt;&gt; The sentence is your legs will be chopped off. &gt;&gt; I won't kill you. &gt;&gt; I will only you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Since that time, he's a &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the believers can always see him. You know, the the police were chasing some &gt;&gt; a gang ofis and one was limping. So the police left all these other spring box and they were after this limping one. because it was an easy catch. You know, &gt;&gt; and people don't realize that Satan is limping and the seven seal finished him off. One day it was the prophet Isaiah's when he looked up he saw him. &gt;&gt; He said, "How did you fall?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You thought you would go beyond God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw him down there in a &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So since that time he is crippling. &gt;&gt; He's limping. I mean he's a He's limping. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now those who don't know him. If you arrive, you will stand still. So that you can see that is now this great chain of perfection broken by time space &gt;&gt; because of sin. Satan caused it. It dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the patching of the lost. God by his sovereign grace somehow lift that little hickey. Amen. Back into a perfect cycle. for it to roll again the same. Now this little loop down down there, Jesus came from eternity, he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and came here in order to sanctify. and to put a a streak of blood across this place, &gt;&gt; that place of that God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to to spread a a a sprinkle blood there across that place to redeem it. To redeem that place of Adam to redeem Adam, the place of Adam to redeem the garden of Eden again because the Garden of Eden itself is a believer. He He redeems the man and his place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God redeems you, then he redeems your position. Amen. Amen. So as a redeemed being occupy a redeemed position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid that anybody can overrun me on that because my position was redeemed. They want to take my pastor. &gt;&gt; Oh, they want to take my pastorship because because his pastorship &gt;&gt; was not redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he came &gt;&gt; stepped into time. He &gt;&gt; he came to that gap. &gt;&gt; Stepped into time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring it again. Now to bring it again together, &gt;&gt; bring Adam back to that place is to bring Adam. &gt;&gt; To bring it back again to bring it back again is to bring Adam &gt;&gt; to the gap. Hallelujah. Amen. Now you say Adam. Yeah. Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam. The man. Adam. &gt;&gt; We were all Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Adam &gt;&gt; was given a sword. &gt;&gt; Brother was the redeemed Adam. He is the redeemed Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To repossess again. Now let's run it down to keep to a safe time. So blood across the place to redeem it back with God again. eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I will take the end of it here. For the prophet says he came with the other end of the road of the robe and he had the other end of the robe it together again. [Music] That's why we have the Old and the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now the seventh man was God's answer for the closing of the gap. That's why he says, "I come standing in the gap." Now let me let's get to this one here. Amen. Blasphemerous names. Uh the prophet says here blasphemous names. This one is page 26. Blasphemous names. Amen. It says &gt;&gt; uh God &gt;&gt; specially upon Adam the breath of eternal life and he became eternal person with God power like God. Yeah. The brother is very careful. He had power like &gt;&gt; for God said, "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness." &gt;&gt; He wasn't a mature God. He was God of the earth, not God of a heaven. Amen. He was God of the earth. And someday the sons of God will again become God. &gt;&gt; Now I always don't believe someday to be just another day that I don't know of and keep on eternally saying someday I believe that that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan says, &gt;&gt; he said, &gt;&gt; "At that day you shall know that I am in you." &gt;&gt; And brother says, "It's this day." &gt;&gt; He he could not keep on saying at that day That day must [Music] so brother Brennham says now this day it is like the lamb took the book from the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. The lamb took the book from the throne. And what else? &gt;&gt; It can't just be the lamb took the book. [Music] He left the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He took the book and walked away. And the prophet says he thundered behind after he had left the place. That's why we can't preach thunders. &gt;&gt; What we can preach &gt;&gt; is the mystery of the thunders. &gt;&gt; What went we can illustrate it again. &gt;&gt; I say every time the president would leave the place There will be some and they would fire some canons and the president is moving on. But there's nothing in those. The president is president. Now the eyes of the people are on the thunders of the president. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they say it revealed then I must see something that it is revealed. island. &gt;&gt; What the thunders revealed is this thing. &gt;&gt; It can't just beh the seals were revealed. &gt;&gt; They revealed something. It is that something that we must receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is like this pastor from the s called church of Christ. &gt;&gt; I was preaching at the funeral. &gt;&gt; I said something about uh the they ate from the tree of life from the tree of knowledge &gt;&gt; and that was adultery. &gt;&gt; Now this pastor after the service He says, "No, I hear that you say um in the Garden of Eden it was adultery or what? What else?" I said, "Yeah, this is what the Bible says. They ate from the tree of knowledge and they realized that they were naked." &gt;&gt; So, can you interpret that they ate from the tree of knowledge? realized that they were naked. &gt;&gt; Their eyes were open. &gt;&gt; You can take it to a little girl today. &gt;&gt; She comes up and uh of course we don't have sweet 16s today before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We used to have sweet 16. But it's no longer sweet because 16 has a child already. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he says &gt;&gt; uh the Bible says they ate from the &gt;&gt; they ate from from from the uh they ate the fruits. &gt;&gt; I said no the the right interpretation is a fruit not fruit of the tree not fruits of the tree. That tree has one fruit. Now you can read between the lines. &gt;&gt; The tree had one fruit. &gt;&gt; And when their eyes were opened, the Bible says they saw that the tree was pleasant. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whistling started just there. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They saw that the tree was &gt;&gt; pleasant to the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. And good for food. Now you can go back to come back today. when she grows up &gt;&gt; and that boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once they touch touch that fruit, &gt;&gt; they become wild. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time they feel guilty or she feels guilty. Every time you call her or &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He feels so guilty &gt;&gt; and they start to do this. &gt;&gt; It's now 4:00. Where were you? Okay, let me leave it like that. Let's let's let's finish here with the gods. &gt;&gt; God specially upon Adam breath the breath of life and made him an eternal person. That's why he lost the battle in nature. I will redeem because the seed is still there. &gt;&gt; He had power like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me talk to a brother. &gt;&gt; He had power &gt;&gt; like God. He was an amateur god. &gt;&gt; He was God of the earth. &gt;&gt; And someday the sons of God will again become God. [Music] &gt;&gt; When is someday? &gt;&gt; That's why Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I say &gt;&gt; he took the book, &gt;&gt; then he walked away. And the prophet says he standed where he left. [Music]
