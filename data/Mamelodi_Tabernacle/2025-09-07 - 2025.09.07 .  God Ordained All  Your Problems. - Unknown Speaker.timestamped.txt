[1:24:26] Once more happy
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:30] to be amongst you.
[1:24:33] Amen. Um I'm happy again
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; to be under a ministry of a man.
[1:24:46] like my pastor.
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:52] My
[1:24:53] my my spiritual father
[1:25:00] is not ashamed
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; to call me his son.
[1:25:09] And then I'm I'm not also ashamed to
[1:25:12] call him
[1:25:15] my father
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; and then
[1:25:20] I know
[1:25:22] he's in hospital
[1:25:25] but I believe everything is going well
[1:25:34] and our pastor has preached.
[1:25:38] He has preached everything.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I don't think there is anything left
[1:25:50] which he has not preached about.
[1:25:56] When God allowed this disease to take
[1:25:58] over, sorry, when God allowed this
[1:26:01] disease to take over
[1:26:06] is because the pastor is finished.
[1:26:12] What I'm what I'm standing here to say
[1:26:18] is just to take from what he has
[1:26:20] preached
[1:26:24] and remind you about what he has already
[1:26:27] preached.
[1:26:31] There is nothing you I can preach about.
[1:26:37] In the message I'm going to preach here
[1:26:39] today,
[1:26:42] he has already preached about it.
[1:26:47] But I'm just going to remind you about
[1:26:50] that.
[1:26:53] Then while standing on our feet,
[1:26:57] I'm not going to be too long.
[1:27:01] As usual,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be short.
[1:27:08] Uh,
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; let's read the book of Romans, chapter
[1:27:10] 8.
[1:27:14] We start from verse 17 to 18. Verse 17
[1:27:20] and we skip, we read verse 28.
[1:27:26] 28.
[1:27:29] Romans chapter 8 from verse 17.
[1:27:35] And if children, then as as of God and
[1:27:39] join us with Christ, if so be that we
[1:27:42] suffer with him, that we may be also
[1:27:45] glorified together. For I reckon that
[1:27:49] the suffering of this present time are
[1:27:51] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:27:54] which shall be revealed in us. Verse 28.
[1:28:00] And we know that all things work
[1:28:02] together for good to them that love God,
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to
[1:28:08] his purpose.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; For whom All right,
[1:28:14] let's close our eyes.
[1:28:17] My dearly father,
[1:28:21] humbly
[1:28:23] standing in your presence,
[1:28:27] we really say forgive us all our
[1:28:30] trespasses.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Use
[1:28:34] my voice
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and my brother's voice here
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; to convey your message to your children.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I pray. Heavenly Father, In the name of
[1:28:46] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to have just a small
[1:28:59] topic here.
[1:29:04] It says
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; God ordained all your problems.
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:15] If I can say he he has not ordained them
[1:29:19] before,
[1:29:24] I will be saying he is not infinite.
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:31] And if he is infinite,
[1:29:35] he has ordained everything.
[1:29:40] Whatever happens to me,
[1:29:44] whatever happens to my pastor,
[1:29:48] God had ordained them before.
[1:29:52] What happened to the church here?
[1:29:56] God had ordained them before.
[1:30:01] then we know
[1:30:04] uh whatever happens to the child of God
[1:30:08] had a purpose in it.
[1:30:13] There is nothing which happened to the
[1:30:14] child of God
[1:30:18] which God doesn't have a purpose in it.
[1:30:23] Let me read something here.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Is the book in this book
[1:30:30] the prophet says people they were
[1:30:33] thinking something about Jonah.
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] Thinking that Jonah was out of the will
[1:30:41] of God.
[1:30:46] But Jonah was not out of the will of
[1:30:47] God.
[1:30:51] What was happening there?
[1:30:54] It was according to God's purpose.
[1:30:59] But to my eye
[1:31:03] and to each and everybody's eye.
[1:31:07] It seems Jonah was dodging the calling,
[1:31:14] but it was not so.
[1:31:16] It was pre-planned.
[1:31:20] that it must go like that.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet is saying.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Let's take a prophet again just a
[1:31:30] moment.
[1:31:34] Jonah Jonah
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; I had first chapter of Jonah wrote down
[1:31:39] here
[1:31:42] Jonah came from the whale belly.
[1:31:49] was a sign.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; They worship God. They worship God of
[1:31:56] the sea.
[1:32:01] And their God was a whale.
[1:32:07] How many people tried to condemn Jonah?
[1:32:12] I always took up for Jonah.
[1:32:20] Jonah wasn't out of the will of the
[1:32:22] Lord.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the Russians
[1:32:30] is ordered by the Lord.
[1:32:34] We want to say
[1:32:36] he is a Jonah.
[1:32:38] But let's take it.
[1:32:41] I know he was supposed to go to Nene.
[1:32:47] But God had him to take the ship to
[1:32:53] Are you listening?
[1:32:55] He was supposed to go to Nin.
[1:32:59] But God,
[1:33:01] but if you read from the Bible,
[1:33:04] you you you hear that Jonah decided
[1:33:10] he was afraid to go to need
[1:33:13] because he thought those people are
[1:33:15] hidden
[1:33:17] and those people are Gentiles
[1:33:20] and Gentiles are called docks.
[1:33:24] God cannot send me to Gentiles.
[1:33:27] God cannot send me to dock
[1:33:30] then let me take this.
[1:33:33] The prophet says
[1:33:35] God
[1:33:37] had him to take that ship to
[1:33:43] some sometimes things which happen
[1:33:46] we must give them chance
[1:33:51] so that can come so that God can himself
[1:33:53] come
[1:33:56] because if you see some dust going up
[1:34:01] then you get inside the dust.
[1:34:03] They will never see correctly.
[1:34:06] You must wait for the dust to go down
[1:34:12] when the dust has gone down.
[1:34:14] Then you must look then you'll see
[1:34:17] clearly what is happening there
[1:34:21] when
[1:34:22] decide to go to
[1:34:25] the prophet says here God had Jonah to
[1:34:30] take ship to
[1:34:34] It was not Jonah. It was God
[1:34:40] and he had the trouble to come up on the
[1:34:43] sea.
[1:34:48] Then we must believe that what is
[1:34:49] happening to our pastor there
[1:34:54] is is is God's purpose. It has God's
[1:34:57] purpose in it.
[1:35:00] We don't know that purpose. But we must
[1:35:03] not just rush.
[1:35:06] We must wait
[1:35:08] and see what the purpose of God.
[1:35:12] We must see the purpose of God unfolded
[1:35:17] and it will be unfolded.
[1:35:22] It will be unfolded one way or the
[1:35:24] other.
[1:35:26] We must not think
[1:35:29] But God had a purpose.
[1:35:34] Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; He had the trouble to come up in the
[1:35:40] sea.
[1:35:44] That trouble in the sea
[1:35:48] caused by John
[1:35:51] not going to Nene
[1:35:54] going to Tarish.
[1:35:56] because the trouble for the people in
[1:35:58] the sea.
[1:36:01] But he said himself,
[1:36:04] Jonah said,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; "Tie my hands and feet.
[1:36:11] I am the one in trouble.
[1:36:16] I'm the one that caused it
[1:36:21] and threw him out."
[1:36:24] And a fish was swimming through the
[1:36:26] water.
[1:36:31] You see the purpose of God
[1:36:35] when they when they throw him the ship
[1:36:38] the fish was already there
[1:36:41] waiting for John
[1:36:43] because God knew
[1:36:46] the people Jonah was going to
[1:36:50] they their God was a fish.
[1:36:55] And if Jonah could come through the
[1:36:58] fish,
[1:37:01] they will respect Jonah
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; because he came through their own God
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:08] and they will believe that this was sent
[1:37:10] to us by our God
[1:37:15] and they will listen to John because he
[1:37:18] came through their God.
[1:37:22] But if he would have just went there,
[1:37:25] they wouldn't have listened to him,
[1:37:28] perhaps they would have killed him.
[1:37:31] But because he came,
[1:37:34] let me read.
[1:37:36] Notice all people was out fishing,
[1:37:42] pulling their nets and things.
[1:37:45] After a while up come the sea god
[1:37:51] the way
[1:37:52] and rushing towards the bank.
[1:37:58] The ship was the fish was rushing
[1:37:59] towards the bank.
[1:38:02] Every everybody fell on their knees
[1:38:07] because their God was coming
[1:38:10] and they and
[1:38:13] God knows how to do things.
[1:38:16] Amen. Do you see God knows how to do
[1:38:20] things?
[1:38:23] Our minds are so limited.
[1:38:28] That's why God wants us to believe him,
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:34] not to try to reason things out.
[1:38:40] But to believe in God.
[1:38:44] God knows how to do things.
[1:38:48] And he got right to the bank
[1:38:53] and leaked out his tongue.
[1:38:56] That is the fish.
[1:38:58] And when he did,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; here come the prophet walking around out
[1:39:04] of the whale's mouth.
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:17] Because
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus quoted this.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "As Jonah was in the belly of
[1:39:26] the fish,
[1:39:30] he had to be in that bailey
[1:39:34] because he he has to make that sign
[1:39:38] that the the Lord Jesus,
[1:39:41] he will be in the bail of the earth.
[1:39:46] He had to do that.
[1:39:49] But when he was doing that, it seems as
[1:39:52] if he was going out of the will of God.
[1:40:01] The prophet is God spit the prophet
[1:40:05] right out of the bank.
[1:40:12] You see, when the sheep was coming
[1:40:17] Yeah, they were they were inspired and
[1:40:18] then all that their God was coming.
[1:40:22] They were happy. Their gods were coming
[1:40:23] to us.
[1:40:26] There are people who love their God.
[1:40:29] But there are people who don't love this
[1:40:31] God of us.
[1:40:37] You see, when people go to sports,
[1:40:41] they wear different kinds of
[1:40:45] And you see they will never sit down.
[1:40:50] You see when they you see their champion
[1:40:54] even if they their team is is beaten.
[1:40:59] You see but you see people in the church
[1:41:07] but they say they love this God.
[1:41:17] Even when we were
[1:41:20] handing her or something
[1:41:24] with our dogs,
[1:41:27] when the hair gets out
[1:41:30] when the door rush,
[1:41:33] we also run after them.
[1:41:35] But we say sir sir satch catch catch.
[1:41:41] We don't just keep quiet.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; You must also say to me, "Catch him.
[1:41:45] Catch him. Catch him.
[1:42:00] No wonder
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; they repented.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:42:09] God ordained your problems.
[1:42:15] He made them hard for you to solve them.
[1:42:24] He made them so hard.
[1:42:27] When you try to solve them,
[1:42:30] you fail,
[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:34] he made them so hard
[1:42:37] so that he can come so that he can be
[1:42:40] the only one
[1:42:42] who can solve them.
[1:42:45] Amen.
[1:42:48] Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; He He is a He is our God is a
[1:42:57] specialist.
[1:43:07] said this word.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Saying our God is a specialist.
[1:43:16] Specialist.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I am also saying my God is a specialist.
[1:43:25] He he he he specialized in things which
[1:43:28] you cannot solve. Hallelujah.
[1:43:36] But if you try,
[1:43:38] he stand there and look at you.
[1:43:44] He says, I think of my wife of 22 years
[1:43:48] old.
[1:43:53] Taken just merely a girl. Sorry. Taken
[1:43:56] just merely a girl.
[1:44:00] A little mother there.
[1:44:03] When the papers give headlines here,
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:08] a young mother
[1:44:12] just dies.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; How my heart bled.
[1:44:21] I didn't know what to do.
[1:44:28] But today I know it was all working for
[1:44:31] my good
[1:44:38] I didn't know
[1:44:41] but today I know
[1:44:43] I know the life had to be ground
[1:44:50] and twisted
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and squeezed.
[1:44:57] to get what it what in it was out.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; There was too much of brenam in there
[1:45:11] had to be squeezed out.
[1:45:15] But before God could make himself known,
[1:45:20] there was too much of you in you.
[1:45:28] God had to squeeze it out
[1:45:34] through trials.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; While that squeeze was coming on,
[1:45:42] it is hard. It is hard.
[1:45:47] But after a while,
[1:45:49] the skies clear back.
[1:45:52] Then you see the purpose of God.
[1:45:56] Then you cry, "I know my redeemer.
[1:46:02] At the last day he shall stand on the
[1:46:04] earth.
[1:46:07] Though the skin worms destroy these,
[1:46:11] yet in my flesh shall I see God."
[1:46:16] These little trials
[1:46:19] things are just for a moment.
[1:46:23] They will fade and pass away.
[1:46:28] But they are only done for your good.
[1:46:35] Let us remember that that God would get
[1:46:39] the glory.
[1:46:42] [Applause]
[1:46:45] He specializes
[1:46:48] in things that we cannot.
[1:46:52] When Moses was standing before Farah,
[1:46:57] Janice and Jambru
[1:47:00] imitating him in whatever he was doing.
[1:47:04] When he throw the stick down, they threw
[1:47:07] theirs down and they turned into
[1:47:09] serpent.
[1:47:11] But God didn't tell Moses
[1:47:13] that when you get there, you're going to
[1:47:16] find janies and jumbles.
[1:47:19] They are going to do exactly what they
[1:47:20] do. He didn't tell him like that. But
[1:47:24] what Moses know God said, "Oh,
[1:47:29] I have come down. I'm going to deliver
[1:47:32] them."
[1:47:33] He was going with the word of God of
[1:47:37] saying God is going to deliver these
[1:47:40] people.
[1:47:42] If these people can do what I can do,
[1:47:45] then I must wait for him.
[1:47:49] Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He was just looking at the snakes there
[1:47:56] in there.
[1:47:58] You see
[1:48:01] you you try to make Jimmy G.
[1:48:06] See born
[1:48:09] simple thing
[1:48:13] Moses seemed to be embarrassed.
[1:48:17] that was beyond his ability.
[1:48:23] But because our God is a specialist
[1:48:27] and he and and he specialized on things
[1:48:32] or things which we cannot
[1:48:35] we cannot do ourselves
[1:48:38] the snake of Moses.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Just look at these two snakes and start
[1:48:44] to swallow them up.
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:49] I think Moses heart was championed.
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; After the Moses after the serpent of
[1:49:00] Moses
[1:49:02] swallowed those others nose,
[1:49:06] Moses took it by the the tail.
[1:49:12] To take a snake by the tail
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; is dangerous.
[1:49:19] taking a stick by the tape.
[1:49:21] Yeah. Yeah. You are risking.
[1:49:25] You better try to hold it by the head.
[1:49:29] But not the snake. But not the When you
[1:49:32] said,
[1:49:35] hit you once. But Moses was told to do
[1:49:40] something which is difficult.
[1:49:44] You must take it by faith.
[1:49:46] You mustn't say I know this thing will
[1:49:49] hurt me.
[1:49:52] If I do like this, it will hurt me. No,
[1:49:56] no, no. God said, "Take it by the tail."
[1:50:00] Moses went then take it by the tail. It
[1:50:04] turned into a rod
[1:50:07] in Moses hand.
[1:50:15] Far and his group
[1:50:18] they were embarrassed.
[1:50:22] I think I believe Janis and Jambro
[1:50:27] they said to Farah
[1:50:29] where is our wrote
[1:50:35] where we going to get the rod back
[1:50:38] Moses where can
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] they don't know
[1:50:44] this is my ro
[1:50:48] [Applause]
[1:50:51] I don't No,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; he made that problems hard for Moses
[1:51:04] so that Moses himself cannot solve them
[1:51:09] so that he God himself
[1:51:14] can come down
[1:51:17] and solve it himself.
[1:51:21] He he always loves that.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:51:27] to come when things are difficult.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; You see there are people
[1:51:37] who love to preach something like this.
[1:51:42] Come to Christ.
[1:51:44] Everything will be all right.
[1:51:50] But let me see what the prophet says
[1:51:54] in this book. Through the scene,
[1:51:58] the Christian doesn't ask for easy
[1:52:01] things.
[1:52:06] There is so much promises today
[1:52:11] that are made among Christians.
[1:52:18] So many ministers
[1:52:20] [Music]
[1:52:22] promise the people false things.
[1:52:28] They say if you just come to Christ,
[1:52:32] all your troubles is settled.
[1:52:38] The prophet now says,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you, when you come to Christ,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; they then begin
[1:52:50] They tell you when you come to Christ
[1:52:54] everything all troubles have
[1:52:58] my prophet says I tell you when you come
[1:53:02] to Christ they then began
[1:53:09] that is when you put on a uniform
[1:53:14] and take be a gun
[1:53:18] and enter the battlefield.
[1:53:21] This Christian root is not a flowery bed
[1:53:24] of ease.
[1:53:30] My pastor used to say
[1:53:34] people thought when they get into Canaan
[1:53:39] into the promised land they will just
[1:53:41] find uh vine trees there.
[1:53:46] They will just sleep under divine tree
[1:53:50] then open their mouth
[1:53:53] then open their mouth then a grip just
[1:53:55] fall in the mouth
[1:53:58] and they will just chew.
[1:54:00] Next time they will just see the the
[1:54:02] honey bee
[1:54:05] and then the bee fall the honey falls
[1:54:08] into their mouth
[1:54:11] sleeping under the tree. It was not like
[1:54:13] that.
[1:54:15] They had to fight
[1:54:17] so that they can possess their land.
[1:54:22] It's not the flowery bed of
[1:54:30] it's not for cowards.
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:35] Cowards will complain and complain and
[1:54:38] complain.
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:50] It is a battle
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; from the very hour you start
[1:54:56] until your spirit is set free by death.
[1:55:03] You are not at you are not at a picnic
[1:55:06] here.
[1:55:08] You are on a battleground.
[1:55:11] And so we are promised.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; We know what we preach
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; because God has sent us the prophet.
[1:55:28] When things goes wrong,
[1:55:31] we must not preach wrong things.
[1:55:36] But we must say,
[1:55:38] "Fear not.
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:46] That that must be our message.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Let me read something inside here. I
[1:56:00] said I'm going to be short.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have more troubles.
[1:56:12] when we become Christian
[1:56:15] than when we did
[1:56:18] when we were still sinners.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; It it but it is of course
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; it is written.
[1:56:28] Many is the afflictions of the
[1:56:30] righteous.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That is what is written.
[1:56:38] Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just written there for nothing.
[1:56:48] If it's said like that,
[1:56:51] the affliction of righteous must be
[1:56:53] many.
[1:56:57] Because God said so.
[1:57:02] Even if you can try to rub it or take
[1:57:04] out that page,
[1:57:09] But it is a seat.
[1:57:14] It is written.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Many is the affliction of the Russians.
[1:57:22] But God
[1:57:24] delivered him from them all.
[1:57:33] God promised many afflictions.
[1:57:37] and strange feelings
[1:57:40] and strange things that we would it
[1:57:43] would be beyond our understanding.
[1:57:48] But it is always done for our good.
[1:57:55] We just can't understand it
[1:57:59] because if we did then it would not be
[1:58:02] of faith.
[1:58:06] We must not try to understand
[1:58:09] but we we must believe.
[1:58:13] Amen.
[1:58:15] When Satan comes like a flag
[1:58:20] our God promised
[1:58:22] he will raise the stand.
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:29] We mustn't try to understand.
[1:58:34] If we do that, we would go with
[1:58:37] understanding.
[1:58:39] We would go with understanding, not
[1:58:41] faith.
[1:58:46] But you must go with faith.
[1:58:51] But we do it.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; We have it.
[1:58:57] We believe by faith.
[1:59:00] with that is going to work some good
[1:59:02] things for us.
[1:59:07] If we could grasp that today
[1:59:11] on in this morning,
[1:59:14] if we could grasp that all of our
[1:59:16] troubles,
[1:59:21] there is none of us immune from them.
[1:59:29] to realize that those things are for our
[1:59:32] good.
[1:59:36] It is written in one scripture
[1:59:40] in the Bible that trials are brought
[1:59:43] upon us
[1:59:46] are more precious to us than gold
[1:59:48] itself.
[1:59:53] I believe now you you realize what the
[1:59:56] pastor has said.
[1:59:59] He said you cannot buy a clay p this
[2:00:02] side.
[2:00:05] You must let it go through the fireplace
[2:00:08] [Applause]
[2:00:09] then buy it at that site.
[2:00:12] But if you can buy it at this side
[2:00:15] our pastor
[2:00:18] he said you will regret yourself.
[2:00:22] You see dispute this one is
[2:00:25] I won't take this. No, leave them all.
[2:00:30] They must go through the fire and look
[2:00:33] them at that side. Then you can buy
[2:00:38] [Music]
[2:00:41] because the one which you said this is
[2:00:43] the next one it may fail the test.
[2:00:49] Amen.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; For is God giving us trials
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; after we become his property,
[2:01:07] after our confession,
[2:01:10] after our baptism,
[2:01:13] our promise to walk in life for him.
[2:01:20] Then every trial that comes upon us
[2:01:26] is to is to perfect us
[2:01:30] for his glory,
[2:01:33] is to bring us to a place
[2:01:37] where God can make himself more real to
[2:01:40] us
[2:01:45] than he was before the trial.
[2:01:52] Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; He also says this
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; is our prophet.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Let me read him
[2:02:08] in this book. He says,
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; "But it is all with purpose."
[2:02:17] All right, let me stud it above there.
[2:02:21] He may commit you to death
[2:02:26] as he did Paul.
[2:02:30] He may commit you to suffering
[2:02:36] as he did Job.
[2:02:40] But that is his prerogative.
[2:02:43] He is sovereign.
[2:02:47] But it is all with a purpose.
[2:02:51] If he did not have a purpose,
[2:02:55] then he would be an author of
[2:02:57] frustration,
[2:03:00] not of peace.
[2:03:04] His purpose
[2:03:06] is that after we have suffered a while,
[2:03:12] we would be made perfect.
[2:03:15] would be made established,
[2:03:19] will be strengthened
[2:03:21] and will be settled.
[2:03:27] Today they see you woriing here.
[2:03:30] Now you are worshiping that side in that
[2:03:33] side
[2:03:36] because you are not settled.
[2:03:39] You are not established.
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:44] If you are settled and established,
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:48] nothing will move you.
[2:03:53] When things comes, they just strengthen
[2:03:57] you.
[2:04:00] You see a tree. When wind comes,
[2:04:05] when that tree is pliable,
[2:04:09] when when the tree when the wind goes
[2:04:11] that way,
[2:04:13] the wind will go this way. the tree will
[2:04:14] go this way when it will go that way.
[2:04:18] The more the more it it does that
[2:04:21] the the soil there
[2:04:24] get soft then
[2:04:27] the the roots go down
[2:04:31] is the more the roots go down.
[2:04:33] [Applause]
[2:04:37] You think the tree is suffering.
[2:04:40] [Applause]
[2:04:44] But this
[2:04:46] [Applause]
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:54] you see he himself suffered.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; He learned obedience by the things he
[2:05:02] suffered. man.
[2:05:07] He He was actually made perfect by
[2:05:10] things that he suffered.
[2:05:17] He said
[2:05:19] in the book of Hebrews 5:8,
[2:05:24] "Though he was a son,
[2:05:28] yet he he learned obedience.
[2:05:35] by the things which he suffered.
[2:05:39] And being made perfect,
[2:05:42] he became the author of eternal
[2:05:44] salvation
[2:05:50] and to all them that obey him.
[2:05:55] In a plain language,
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:58] the very character of Jesus
[2:06:02] was perfected by suffering.
[2:06:07] And according to Paul,
[2:06:09] he has left his church a measure of
[2:06:12] suffering
[2:06:17] that they too
[2:06:19] by by their faith in God
[2:06:23] while suffering for him. Sorry. While
[2:06:25] suffering for him,
[2:06:29] come to a place of perfection.
[2:06:34] Amen.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; He says here,
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; where does he stand by?
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by?
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Why does why does he leave people get
[2:06:45] inside the suffering?
[2:06:49] The reason is in Romans chapter 8 verse
[2:06:53] 17 to 187
[2:06:57] to 18. We must suffer with him
[2:07:02] so that we can rule with him.
[2:07:06] If we don't suffer with him, then we'll
[2:07:08] never rule with him.
[2:07:13] Amen.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Unless we suffer with him,
[2:07:17] we cannot reign with him.
[2:07:20] To suffer
[2:07:22] to reign. The reason for this is that
[2:07:26] character simply
[2:07:30] is never made without suffering.
[2:07:36] Character is a victory.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; It's not a gift.
[2:07:42] You cannot pray God give me character.
[2:07:45] You cannot pray God give me character
[2:07:50] fasting seven times.
[2:07:54] You will remain the same you are.
[2:07:58] Character
[2:07:59] is victory
[2:08:01] not the gift. A man without character
[2:08:07] can't reign
[2:08:10] because power apart from character
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; is satanic.
[2:08:18] But power with character
[2:08:22] is fit to rule.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[2:08:29] You cannot rule without courage.
[2:08:32] You must have courage.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Then you are fit to rule.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; That is what our prophet says.
[2:08:45] When the children of Israel here
[2:08:52] when they were facing that fire,
[2:08:59] the king telling them
[2:09:02] Why don't you bow down?
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; They answered the king.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Our God
[2:09:11] is able.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; They were leaning at the they relied on
[2:09:19] the ability of their God.
[2:09:25] When when they were thrown in that fire,
[2:09:29] the invisible
[2:09:32] becomes visible.
[2:09:35] Until the king said, I said,
[2:09:39] "Our God is a specialist.
[2:09:43] He specialist on things that you cannot
[2:09:48] where you cannot help yourself.
[2:09:51] God comes in there
[2:09:54] when they were in that dark hour
[2:09:59] when they were when they have already
[2:10:01] thrown into that fire.
[2:10:05] When their hopes were gone,
[2:10:09] when they fall in that fire, they found
[2:10:12] that this place is less than that we
[2:10:13] are.
[2:10:21] The king said,
[2:10:24] "Hi,
[2:10:25] we have how many people have we thrown
[2:10:28] in that day?"
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; They said, "Four keep three king." He
[2:10:34] said, "But I see four
[2:10:38] and the other one is like the son of
[2:10:40] God."
[2:10:44] Because the invisible
[2:10:47] become visible. Now even the king could
[2:10:50] see
[2:10:52] sometimes they invisible
[2:10:55] because the Bible says our our angels
[2:10:59] encamped around us
[2:11:02] and we don't they are invisible
[2:11:05] but one day those angels will become
[2:11:10] visible
[2:11:12] when you are in trouble
[2:11:15] the invisible
[2:11:17] will be visible.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I think a certain wish doctor,
[2:11:30] he was my neighbor.
[2:11:33] I think he was trying to bewish me
[2:11:40] at midnight
[2:11:43] when he tried to come in my house.
[2:11:48] He find me standing in there.
[2:11:52] He went back
[2:11:54] tomorrow in the morning.
[2:11:56] He said to me, "What was you doing
[2:11:59] there?"
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:03] I say, "What?"
[2:12:05] And today at about 2 or 3,
[2:12:10] I said, "No, is my house this?"
[2:12:16] I I I've got all the right
[2:12:19] to move around the house
[2:12:23] at at any time
[2:12:26] whether night whether day when I want to
[2:12:31] go around
[2:12:33] I just go around
[2:12:35] but I wasn't there I was sleeping
[2:12:42] the invisible
[2:12:45] become Invisible that wish doctor.
[2:12:58] He specialized in things we cannot do.
[2:13:04] When there was no one to open the book
[2:13:08] when there was no one
[2:13:11] and to break the seals the rock.
[2:13:15] in heaven, on earth, under the earth.
[2:13:21] He himself
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; open it.
[2:13:26] Amen.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; When there was no one, he himself was
[2:13:31] worthy
[2:13:33] and he took the book and break the sins.
[2:13:39] and he makes us
[2:13:42] worthy
[2:13:44] to receive that book.
[2:13:47] Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; It's not that we are intelligent or
[2:13:52] or perhap we live better than others.
[2:13:56] He made us
[2:13:59] to be worthy to receive that blue
[2:14:03] because he was the worthy one.
[2:14:07] Take that brew. and break the seals, the
[2:14:10] rock and bring it to us. And that's why
[2:14:13] we're happy today because he made us
[2:14:16] worthy.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; The seals will open for us.
[2:14:32] That's why we receive them.
[2:14:36] Amen.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem
[2:14:40] when people are wondering.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; We are happy.
[2:14:49] Not long ago,
[2:14:54] a man said to me
[2:14:57] that the Roman Catholic Church
[2:15:01] had to be the true church
[2:15:05] as it had been true to what it believed
[2:15:12] all over the years
[2:15:16] and kept on growing.
[2:15:19] not changing.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; That isn't so
[2:15:24] so at all.
[2:15:27] any church with the government becking
[2:15:30] behind it
[2:15:35] and with its own cre
[2:15:39] which isn't the word of God at all
[2:15:43] with no manifest manifested ministry
[2:15:49] to cause the devil to get around it.
[2:15:53] If the the the manifested ministry
[2:15:58] cause the devil
[2:16:02] to come to attack,
[2:16:06] the devil attacked you
[2:16:08] because you have got something in you
[2:16:12] which is God.
[2:16:15] If God is not in you, why should Satan
[2:16:19] bought himself about you?
[2:16:22] When you start to grow,
[2:16:25] Satan and his demons,
[2:16:28] they will come.
[2:16:32] That's why he he does not bore himself
[2:16:34] in Catholics.
[2:16:41] He says here
[2:16:43] that was not a criterion.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; But when you think of that little group,
[2:16:54] whose members were sown as
[2:17:01] fed to lions,
[2:17:04] persecuted,
[2:17:06] driven from pillar to post.
[2:17:10] He had stayed true to the way.
[2:17:15] Now definitely from the definitely that
[2:17:18] would have to be God. Amen.
[2:17:26] How they survived their battle of faith
[2:17:33] and carried on still.
[2:17:36] That is a miracle. Amen.
[2:17:42] Why?
[2:17:43] Because God when Satan comes like a
[2:17:47] flood,
[2:17:49] God resist standard.
[2:17:52] When Satan say now I kill
[2:17:56] the oxlike creature,
[2:18:02] come on. and announces
[2:18:06] and gives them the spirit of of an ox,
[2:18:12] a sacrificing spirit.
[2:18:16] They all want to be killed.
[2:18:19] They all want to be persecuted.
[2:18:22] They don't step back. The more they are
[2:18:25] persecuted, they they all go there.
[2:18:29] And I was told by my my prophet
[2:18:32] that one soldier
[2:18:35] who was taking people to the arena
[2:18:39] will be fed by the lions.
[2:18:42] He repented on the way
[2:18:46] when going to the taking the people he
[2:18:50] also he said I am part of these people
[2:18:54] because the spirit in those people was
[2:18:57] not their own spirit. God has given them
[2:19:00] another spirit.
[2:19:02] God has raised the standard.
[2:19:08] When you feel pity for them when you
[2:19:10] feel pity for them
[2:19:12] But they were not feeling pity for one
[2:19:14] another.
[2:19:15] They were happy.
[2:19:17] [Applause]
[2:19:20] When you take one and throw him into the
[2:19:24] praise God,
[2:19:27] [Applause]
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; he is a specialist.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; He just want us to believe.
[2:19:44] in his ability.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; He is always there to act.
[2:19:56] That is the reason he said, "Fear not.
[2:20:00] All things are possible
[2:20:04] to them that believe.
[2:20:06] Everything
[2:20:08] work together for good.
[2:20:13] to those who love him,
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; not to all
[2:20:19] to those who
[2:20:21] love him.
[2:20:23] Amen.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; All things work for good
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; to those who are called
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you. on a short
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; while my brother comes.
[2:21:06] God bless.

[2:25:10] [Applause]
[2:25:15] Now, I'm going to do something unusual
[2:25:18] now,
[2:25:20] but I've requested the pastor
[2:25:23] because it reminds me when the
[2:25:26] tabernacle of God was entering the
[2:25:28] temple

[2:25:44] I want us to rejoice.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; I want us to celebrate
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; because God
[2:25:54] has answered you.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; No more complaints.
[2:26:02] God is in control.
[2:26:11] Let's just celebrate for the moment.

[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Makua
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; to come and share the word with us.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Indeed, you are a specialist, my God.
[2:32:16] I search all over
[2:32:19] and still find there is none like thee.
[2:32:30] When you do things, you do things. Oh,
[2:32:34] you know how to do things
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; and that makes you a specialist.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[2:33:14] The more the wind blows
[2:33:18] is the more we anchor

[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; thank you for what came forth.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; I am so happy Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; To learn that a character
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; is what we need
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; and you always
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; wanted us to be like you, Father.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Fellow, you didn't take a shortcut.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; You came the same route
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; that we are coming through. Oh God,
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; all the afflictions
[2:34:01] actually you went through the worst. Oh
[2:34:03] God,
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; and that made you
[2:34:07] to be to be the the Lord of Lots.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible when talks about you, it says
[2:34:15] when you ascended, you ascended high
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; and when you went down, you went lower
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; so that you can be the all in all.
[2:34:27] What a mighty God we serve.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; And you've made us your children. You've
[2:34:33] made us victors, oh God.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:34:39] my prayer is let this thought
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; be with each and every son and daughter
[2:34:47] of God. When we move out of this place,
[2:34:51] we must know that there is a purpose
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; in all the things that we go through.
[2:34:58] And the more there seems to be harder,
[2:35:00] it is for you to come and specialize.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know where we are in our
[2:35:07] lives. And we invite you Lord to come
[2:35:10] and specialize. Heavenly Father, bless
[2:35:12] each and every one of your children.
[2:35:20] this wonderful
[2:35:26] as you go backward the word has been
[2:35:28] delivered
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; and Lord we are praying for our dear
[2:35:33] pastor
[2:35:35] we are here because we have a pastor
[2:35:37] also
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Israel is our pastor
[2:35:46] Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray for him. Lord,
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; I pray that you be with him.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; This is the work of his hands.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; May you may you bless him wherever he
[2:35:59] is, oh God.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; And thank you Lord for a pastor like
[2:36:03] him.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; Continue to bless him. Continue to bless
[2:36:07] his family. And and bless us also.
[2:36:10] Father,
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; as we are going home, we are going home
[2:36:13] a happy people because you have spoken
[2:36:16] to us, we just want to give you all the
[2:36:19] honor and all the glory in the precious
[2:36:22] and wonderful name of our Lord and
[2:36:24] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:34] So we are
[2:36:36] going to baptism
[2:36:40] my brother
[2:36:44] and then we are going to baptism.
[2:36:47] All those who needs to be baptized
[2:36:49] please let them prepare themselves
[2:36:54] and God bless them. Amen.
[2:36:57] Amen.

[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads?
[2:41:17] Dear heavenly father,
[2:41:20] we have heard your word.
[2:41:22] In the beginning was the word. The word
[2:41:25] was with God and that word was God.
[2:41:30] It is the original spoken word. The word
[2:41:33] which was so creative
[2:41:36] when you said let there be light. There
[2:41:38] was light because you came from the
[2:41:40] supernatural being that cover time,
[2:41:44] space and eternity.
[2:41:46] Today you have entered in our precious
[2:41:48] pastor Makua
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; to deliver this masterpiece
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; the golden nuggets
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; from eternity changing us every day
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; with this great power
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; the quickening power
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; in this last days and evil days we see
[2:42:05] this glorious light shining
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; you have called the brothers here and
[2:42:10] sisters
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; we have taken a decision
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; that they are taking up their cross.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; One day, Lord, you came and became a
[2:42:18] man.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; And we're in Jesus, Lord.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; It was written about you.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; It was written about him
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; and he believed in his word.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; He was the fulfillment of all the
[2:42:34] scriptures,
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; all the word that you spoke through all
[2:42:38] the holy prophets. And he knew that he
[2:42:41] must go the way of the cross
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; to die for our sins, Lord
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; to make a great reconciliation
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; to make a new way and a living way
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; for us to get into the holy of holies
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; where the shakana glory always is there
[2:42:58] Lord.
[2:43:00] Father, we thank you for the word that
[2:43:02] has came
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; and you have vedicated yourself, Lord
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; with these saints that have taken a step
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; to die with you, to rise with you and
[2:43:14] sitting in heavenly places. Amen.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Father, we commit this service of bapti
[2:43:20] baptismal
[2:43:22] which you have already given many times
[2:43:24] in the Old Testament.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; When the children of Israel were coming
[2:43:28] up going to the promised land,
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; they had to cross the rod sea. Father,
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; when things were impossible,
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; you intervene, Lord,
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; when people were complaining to Moses,
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; saying, Moses, you brought us from Egypt
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; where we had everything,
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; but you have brought us here,
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; and you make Moses to cross them over,
[2:43:53] Father.
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; You opened that that sea.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you today. You gave us
[2:43:59] a prophet
[2:44:01] who has make a way for us. Lord,
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; you send us seven messengers to deliver
[2:44:07] this word. Father, as we go in the
[2:44:10] baptismal, Father, we believe that
[2:44:13] you'll enter in in this people
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; that are going to be baptized today
[2:44:18] because they saying the very same word.
[2:44:20] You said straight is a gate, narrow is
[2:44:23] the way. Few find that way and that is a
[2:44:26] waterway. The word of God has spoken.
[2:44:29] Bless our pastor. Bless them as they go
[2:44:32] in in the mighty name of our Lord and
[2:44:34] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:44:37] [Applause]
[2:44:43] Acts 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:44:48] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:44:50] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:44:53] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[2:44:56] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:44:59] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:45:01] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[2:45:03] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[2:45:06] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[2:45:10] them,"Repent, and be baptized, every one
[2:45:12] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[2:45:14] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:45:17] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:45:20] the promise is unto you and your
[2:45:22] children, and to all that are a far off,
[2:45:26] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:45:28] call.
