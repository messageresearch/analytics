[2:14:52] is the white
[2:14:54] stone but in the
[2:14:59] pyramid so I was talking to a
[2:15:02] brother that we should
[2:15:05] first show what is a
[2:15:11] pyramid because the people know it as
[2:15:14] just a
[2:15:18] structure but they really don't know
[2:15:22] then time and again we
[2:15:25] quote pyramid pyramid the
[2:15:29] prophet was talking about the pyramid
[2:15:32] the pyramid but I will read you
[2:15:34] something
[2:15:35] here but today we are not on
[2:15:39] that I knew that we will I will have a
[2:15:42] short
[2:15:44] time so now but we are we have that on
[2:15:48] the what is what is
[2:15:52] a
[2:15:55] pyramid then but I will read one part of
[2:16:00] something
[2:16:02] here and Sarah

[2:16:08] ceased to be with Sarah after the man of
[2:16:15] women it

[2:17:15] inside we'll still
[2:17:18] continue we want to come to the pyramid
[2:17:22] what is a
[2:17:24] pyramid because you will realize that at
[2:17:27] the end of it
[2:17:30] all H the prophet said
[2:17:33] something that
[2:17:36] closed the rest of the
[2:17:39] ministry and put it in one
[2:17:44] thing Hallelujah all right
[2:17:48] amen and then
[2:17:51] he says
[2:17:54] yeah he spoke of the dream of Junior

[2:18:05] is this
[2:18:09] one on the inside of that

[2:18:34] people they walking around still
[2:18:38] wondering what is the
[2:18:43] seventh and then as we will continue
[2:18:46] even after
[2:18:49] this then you will see where the seventh
[2:18:52] seal
[2:18:57] is and no one

[2:24:59] are because it's not
[2:25:08] revealed now if you are
[2:25:11] public you are part of
[2:25:14] that then you say to me it
[2:25:19] is but if you are a son you just come
[2:25:24] through amen
[2:25:27] amen praise God now there are things
[2:25:31] that H an ordinary man cannot
[2:25:38] see

[2:25:43] here and it ceased to be with
[2:25:48] Sarah after the man
[2:25:51] of
[2:25:54] churches after the manner of
[2:26:00] women how come that this special
[2:26:04] woman what makes her so
[2:26:08] special it is
[2:26:11] because it
[2:26:14] seized to be with
[2:26:17] her
[2:26:18] after that means they were maners of
[2:26:25] women but God dealt with this one in a
[2:26:29] special
[2:26:34] way she
[2:26:36] didn't need to come through the manner
[2:26:39] of
[2:26:44] women that's why she didn't Belong To
[2:26:47] The World Church
[2:26:55] it was something special in the house of
[2:26:59] Abraham God
[2:27:05] specializ in the house of

[2:29:21] came you know of the angels that
[2:29:28] came from
[2:29:30] the
[2:29:35] West uh did you know
[2:29:38] that there was this Eastern
[2:29:45] West now Genesis chapter 2 tells you
[2:29:49] that
[2:29:53] God placed
[2:29:56] menen
[2:30:02] where the east of the Gard yeah
[2:30:05] am that's
[2:30:08] why he
[2:30:10] says no no let's read it where is it
[2:30:14] Genesis chapter 2 verse verse 8 yeah
[2:30:17] read there let let us see and the Lord
[2:30:20] God planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[2:30:24] and there he put the man whom he had
[2:30:26] formed Amen in that
[2:30:29] Garden
[2:30:32] East what not
[2:30:36] West that's why you hear the prophet
[2:30:39] speaking about East and West has
[2:30:48] met you you you
[2:30:51] remember h i will avoid reading some of
[2:30:55] this but we will come and
[2:30:58] continue but you
[2:31:00] remember the prophet
[2:31:02] said I
[2:31:08] went to
[2:31:09] connect with the angels
[2:31:16] message okay amen now because
[2:31:21] it
[2:31:22] says uh hey where is that scripture
[2:31:27] here what happened
[2:31:30] there we have
[2:31:33] east and

[2:31:43] Adam read it brother you know where is
[2:31:47] it Genesis chapter 2 amen
[2:31:50] yeah and the Lord God planted a garden
[2:31:53] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[2:31:56] man whom he had
[2:31:58] formed
[2:32:01] where yeah so now then the prophet said
[2:32:06] I
[2:32:10] went West to connect with them Angel's
[2:32:16] message and he came back

[2:33:17] interpret for him
[2:33:20] we will see this
[2:33:22] dream on the
[2:33:24] inside why the people don't know what is
[2:33:27] a
[2:33:29] pyramid
[2:33:31] which I've got it will
[2:33:34] come on the inside of the

[2:35:10] East to connect the
[2:35:13] Angels amen amen so that east and west

[3:26:42] Lord for you to come down today amen and
[3:26:46] use our pastor once again delivering
[3:26:49] this
[3:26:50] masterpiece a direct message from that
[3:26:54] great
[3:26:55] rock as you have said that Upon This
[3:26:58] Rock you'll build your church and the
[3:27:02] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[3:27:05] it because it's the great
[3:27:07] Revelation the revelation of the opening
[3:27:10] of The Seven seal that
[3:27:13] closes everything
[3:27:16] father we thank you today to be part and
[3:27:20] parcel of this great
[3:27:22] ministry of the opening of The Seven
[3:27:26] seal when the Bible becomes a new
[3:27:29] book because it's a prophetic
[3:27:32] book and father since you spoke in those
[3:27:35] days amen every man had to come to this
[3:27:38] rock
[3:27:39] confession to identify ourselves who we
[3:27:43] are where we come from where we are and
[3:27:48] where we are
[3:27:49] going father bless our
[3:27:52] pastor who you have kept through all
[3:27:55] these ages
[3:27:57] Lord from
[3:27:59] eternity and Lord we thank you for
[3:28:02] sending a
[3:28:04] prophet in this evil age
[3:28:07] Lord and you gave us a
[3:28:11] prophet and after that Lord the Bible
[3:28:14] became a new book amen
[3:28:17] Lord we thank you for everything that
[3:28:19] you have done for all these years father
[3:28:23] men and women have come in this place to
[3:28:26] hit at that spot of
[3:28:28] Eternity going Africa going the world we
[3:28:32] can hear what they saying out there
[3:28:34] father but today you have spoken may
[3:28:38] this word find a Dwelling Place in our
[3:28:41] hearts because Lord you said this is not
[3:28:43] for a public show
[3:28:46] is strictly to the
[3:28:48] predestinated to the bride The Chosen
[3:28:51] lady because you always tell her all the
[3:28:55] secret I remember one day when I came in
[3:28:58] a message the prophet was talking about
[3:29:01] the Deep calling the
[3:29:03] deep and the pastor one day said the
[3:29:06] third pool will cat the big
[3:29:09] fish because you've got to cast down
[3:29:13] deep father we thank you for the type of
[3:29:15] the
[3:29:16] Ministry that you have given to us your
[3:29:20] word that was there all the time and we
[3:29:23] see it in this great Revelation this
[3:29:26] great Rock Jesus Christ himself Lord the
[3:29:30] solid rock
[3:29:32] stands all other grounds are sinking
[3:29:36] SS but this rock which is called Jesus
[3:29:40] Christ it's a great
[3:29:43] Revelation it's a great mystery
[3:29:46] and one day the prophet it has never
[3:29:49] reached the heart of a man to know what
[3:29:52] God has got in store for us and every
[3:29:55] day we come in this place father to hit
[3:29:58] at the spot of
[3:30:00] Eternity where father we hear our names
[3:30:03] the character of who you are throughout
[3:30:06] the seven Church ages coming in the
[3:30:08] opening of the seals we thank you Lord
[3:30:11] Jesus for giving us a
[3:30:14] Shepherd who always look after our souls
[3:30:17] father who every time he goes and feed
[3:30:21] us with the right food Lord a right
[3:30:24] stuff that has made us to be who we are
[3:30:27] today father as you have delivered this
[3:30:30] word may you seal it in our hearts
[3:30:33] father may we go out there and manifest
[3:30:36] what is in our hearts we cannot help it
[3:30:39] but just to say glory to God and say
[3:30:42] Amen so be it as we go out home Lord
[3:30:46] keep on
[3:30:47] meditating upon this word we can hear
[3:30:51] time and again many sisters and brothers
[3:30:54] are talking about that brother that
[3:30:56] sister there that brother but we have
[3:30:58] heard the message we have heard the word
[3:31:01] of God that you spoke to us through our
[3:31:04] pastor through you the seven Angel
[3:31:08] messenger brother William meran emper
[3:31:12] the seven churches have been preached in
[3:31:13] this place now we have in that opening
[3:31:16] of the seventh seal father and they talk
[3:31:19] about the closing of the seven seal but
[3:31:22] it keeps on
[3:31:24] unfolding and it is that word rock with
[3:31:27] a rock confession every one of us we
[3:31:31] confess who we are where we come from
[3:31:34] and what you have done for us we have
[3:31:36] traveled throughout the seven Church
