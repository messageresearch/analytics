Title: The Third Throne Ministry vol.3
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 02 July 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the Third Throne.

The pastor reads the following scriptures: 

Rev 3:20-22.  Rev 12:7-12 
Genesis 13:5 , 19:27-28

The battle does not start now. The people who fought and overcame the devil in heaven are the people who are still going to fight because God does not have a new army.

Abraham stood where he stood before the Lord and he saw Soddom burning. We also must always find the right place.

The battle that started before time will be finished beyond time in the form of battle of Armageddon.

chapter 3 from verse 14 to 22. and unto the angel of the Church of the auditions right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I will thou were called or hold so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayeth I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I canceled it to buy off me gold I think we shall go back to where we have started previous weeks behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that heaven here let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen you may take your seats okay amen after the vows and camera will just follow this part here thanking the lord you know we were watching and seeing ribona the signs unfolding according to the seventh angel messenger what he has God has given to him for the bride of Christ um it is here with us you know as we said that previous week we are looking at I was trying to come to this Gog and Megan and I just come short of that day in North Carolina reversed back to something because I will read to you again something here there is this three and a half years and this the three and a half years of the Lord Jesus Christ as the prophet says in the sales book 147.147 then we read we go to the Bible again we realize Satan also has three and a half years and I think we have read our scriptures we have the three and a half years and now we have the three and a half years of Satan yeah the prophet puts it in that way because this lasts three and a half years it's called the tribulation period which if you you look at the events unfolding you can see that the tribulation period is here and uh it's just another three and a half years you know the scripture there yeah we I think we read that scripture last time three and a half years which the prophet says now he will become a king is there's a statement here that speaks of this Satan in his time at the breaking of that series he is referring to the seventh sea um that is the end of all things that is the seventh okay and now he says but he will be revealed in his time and the prophet says what statement after the bright is taken away let me read this podcast as I say I'm going just to take uh a small but spiritual part of it and we will still continue next time I read this part let no man deceive you that is Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 9. for that day shall not come except there come a falling away face and that a man of the men of sin City the son of permission who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called to God that is worship as God you see these days we are going to look here in the Bible he is God in the temple of God showing himself that he is you know it is happening even recently The Ten Commandments were changed by somebody Pope went up there to the mountains those things were read out to us he has changed so he was talking also of going to the same mountains foreign uh long time the followers will understand of the message now right now this battle or the wall is actually how about this pushing his way battle of but you you remember the Revelation chapter verse the Battle of Ahmad verse no let's start from uh verse 12. okay verse 12 Revelation chapter 12 from verse 10 to 12. amen and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice see Heaven say neither dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the F and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he had but a short time amen amen okay if you [Music] the battle does not start now amen amen and you know we look into it last time that the people what about uh who actually fought and overcame the devils are the people who are still going to fight God God has got no new Army [Applause] there's only one Army you know what I'm here started in heaven and the battle that started in heaven started yeah we are waiting now he says that battle that started in heaven will end up in the Battle of America all right I mean but now since today we are looking at this uh this is the brother read the scripture here yeah Satan which deceived them and verse 9 I'm still I'm trying to read verse nine years amen and the dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth now I heard a loud voice in heaven now is come say a voice saying in heaven now is come salvation strength and the kingdom of ourselves in the power of His Christ for the accuser of our breath down amen amen which accused them before our God therefore Rejoice verse 12. but 11 says and they overcame him by the blood of the Lambs and by the word of their testimony they laughed not their lives therefore surely rejoice when we approach Brothers that's when the prophet says when the bride goes Satan comes down amen amen because you have but some short time foreign the Bible speaks of the Heavenly places just as the statement says after the bride is taken away will reveal himself you should remain blessed tribulations maybe you don't know listen what it says Rejoice please don't dwell they were not they were not taken up in there so they remain as inhabitants foreign all right and for the Devil is cast down unto you who wanted the devil that terrible enemies if then he is cast down unto you he is a problem even if we don't see him around buttons what more if then he's cast down amen amen because all those demons [Applause] speaks of the Demons they were soldiers [Applause] took a farm in the people and they did their work amen amen just like if you look at the witches and so forth demons those bodies foreign [Applause] but but demons will be so active why the river Euphrates in preparation okay do you know where it is in the Bible yeah Revelation chapter 16. level 16. okay verse 12. right and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared right amen it is becoming a way now will it ever see and what they have discovered now when it dried out the voices that are coming from what looks like tunnels inside there amen amen opening yeah the demons are coming down they are coming down amen amen so we are glad we are not part of this because therefore Rejoice he's talking to you [Applause] you that's going in there it's already therefore rejoice there is a predestination [Applause] that was foreign say it Before Time yes amen he says the book that was foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign amen I was reading something here this one says for few years where is my book now I was reading something here yeah that Bible again I mean back to that scripture um behold go back to behold I stand at the door amen uh this is logician church age I will read just small part we are closing we'll continue next time this logician uh you call it you remember the Bible says Lord uh when he looked at Sodom he saw a fertile place ah I won't read before you you we have read that but the Bible says when he looked at the same place amen amen that is Genesis chapter 19. oh I'm talking about Abraham when Abraham Abraham look the Bible says get me that scripture Abraham early in the morning he walked back to the place where he stood before the Lord verse 27 do you have it amen right and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plane and beheld and low the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace that's how the people see things by chapter 13 tells you of Lord what happened Lord where when he saw the same place Genesis chapter 13 from verse 5. a lot also which went with Abraham had flocks and heads and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together yeah did you see the problem of full lot there yeah the Bible says Abraham Abraham foreign people's rights you watched that yeah the people's rights you go to Americans we are America whatever and now they are fighting the gospel because it comes in this way the people's rights yeah yeah maybe if you can say to uh those who do not know um about this uh what do you call it when people hang themselves suicide no no no no no on your your screen there social media people appearing on the screen they want to appear there to be seen of men to do things and so forth what is that where is brother where is not here today okay Instagram Instagram yeah things like that I will show you something should a pastor stand up maybe [Music] don't hang yourself in those things the Devil comes and pick you up I'll tell you something if even the person who hasn't started to do that is [Music] saying to you you are not going to control me now you take magazines I read these things a girl saying I don't want somebody to dictate over me to tell me what to wear you what to use I want to be myself have you seen those things you become a celebrity over a celebrity you want to be yourself no one will tell me what to do what to wear people they call it people's rights amen amen not God not God's rights and the people love this rice don't take your children [Music] the people's right all right that's all okay amen now it is I'm watching that I'm seeing it that man was not doing that and his wife he is doing it just to show that we are not going to control yes but a pastor is not somebody who's controlling somebody the pasta reaches the word of God Amen and the pastor is a Shepherd yes now a Shepherd has got a flop that's why the Lord Jesus my sheep know my voice apostle did you hear policies amen so that that's that that's it amen and now let me just read this part here it shows now the the people taking their rights doing what they want to do nobody will tell them the difference I'll do everything that I want to do I do to my family what I want to do yes is only responsible for his ship Paul was only responsible for those who reside [Applause] to her okay okay now we are we are here I'm looking the drug there yes I mean and I was with this scripture here because we we let me read you uh because we are on the audition where is that loudisha of mine amen amen and there's seven Vision where he he said I I hit a most terrible explosion that is the seven Vision but of uh who who's that who saw Sodom Abraham Abraham Abraham he saw smoke going up yeah the Bible says early in the morning he walked to the place where he stood before [Music] amen amen but did you read off lot also a lot also he looked at the when he separated with Abraham because the problem of Lord Abraham had his head you see I mean a Shepherd has this and a sheep sayona it will be very difficult to look after that chip yeah it has its own Revelations can only look after a ship that cannot look after it [Music] that's why the Lord is my shepherd amen what I don't know he knows all right I'm relying on him okay now this is that's where where it says it speaks of the people's rights with register last time no notice the name the people's rights or Justice of the people was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all nations rising up demanding equality um socially and financially so that's the age we have all those things then it goes to say it was a city of earthquakes what are you seeing today earthquakes everywhere the earthquake finally destroyed it is this age will end up in God shaking the whole world the whole world is it not happening okay if you are watching hello Andy and has gone off to make love with the older heart [Music] earlier only will the World System crumble the systems but the very Earth will be shaken it's in the system is it not happening and then he comes with the Visions now Abraham Abraham saw the smoke um and what did Brothers uh foreign you have things here like three men came to Abra Abraham but have you realized Sodom to Lord Abraham saw three men coming um amen that's why in the house of Abraham Abraham according to the book their souls in prisoner and those men when they come they were three then I will read to you next time that three is the number of Life foreign uh now when they arrive at the Lord because here I'm talking about his in identification with an individual here but we are closing we'll take just a small business the Lord willing will continue his identification is with an individual that's why he says you know I said sometimes actually we are not the message churches [Applause] because a church in the long run will start to do I mean then that one will say this one is not revealed you know it becomes God is dealing with us as you can get the pieces of the price it is now I'm looking yeah at this time love at the people's rights he says his identification is especially in these days people's rights and then he's that's why Abraham Abraham when that morning he he woke up and in the morning now in order for him to see he went back to where he stood before you know you must always find the right place he went back there from there where he stood before the Lord you could see all right amen no I'm looking at Brothers what what happened foreign as I tend to look I saw nothing because [Music] that's the prophet and now we that are watching these things because the prophet has spoken [Music] he was told to foreign now this is what the prophet I'm talking about the seeds will see the same thing that abrahamas it is the Seed of Abraham that's why this Seed of Abraham you remember the message the migration Abraham Abraham just appeared you know about Abraham you saw him only when um God recognized him and the Bible is recognized you only started to see him it is God who recognizes but in the form of melchization logos as the prophet puts it to you was a God and then God is a spirit [Music] a small car yes yes God the capital is the first thing it will be manifested in use Rapture is not something that I'll be waiting for um scripturally saying the Rapture is coming here I must be seriously he says potentially appreciate it is in you already you know every day when I'm walking around it is just in me anytime can be the time [Applause] did you know that uh potentially it's already in you now let me leave it here we will continue as his identification only I will read to you that what we are going to do um foreign question I think oh yeah yeah here we are it's a personal individual Affair now that is Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed that he he's trying to to show that God now at this time it's a personality individual affairs Linda amen amen he has left the church hey did you did you read those things that Christ for Christ is no longer in the church hmm I fear to start now okay it will take us it will take us somewhere but it is there in the seven churches that he is who are not in the church that's why he says he says that's after he was kicked out of the church Brothers page 357. rice test left in the church Christ it's not it's not the The Logical result or end if the word is put aside for crit let me try peace three five six three five six Christ is that's why he says I stand at the door look if any more it didn't say any church any man let me hear my voice it's now individual Affairs open the door because I'm no longer in the church but I come to the individuals I will come into him and we'll stop with him to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my Throne tells me in his throne in his domain even as I also overcast let him hear what the spirit say yes and to the church that I'm no longer in kicked out of the church oh my it says I'm rich that's why how it started congratulations okay amen why he was kicked out because he was told that on um because thou said I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing [Music] miserable and poor and blind and naked foreign lady Deborah amen Buffett they are answering back to one another this age it's God's answering is people answering back to God no we are rich when he comes they say oh enough for me we don't need you we are all right rehabits we have our church our system system we don't need you you know individuals the individuals they don't need him why they they are saying Barry I'm okay I agree right I don't need Jesus I am myself [Music] sure but because of time we are going to continue with these things amen now with this I will say Christ outside the church that is this age I'm reading from church [Music] spirit says unto the churches it is not a personal message where is he says where the spirit says to the churches because Christ Our Christian way Jesus is Christ has left the church is this not The Logical result or an end is not aside amen this is what I'm reading fella the the theme here is just Christ is outside the church the auditions we come together as individuals not under a church system s for you to be born again it is because you are not born again in order to be a seeds I have listened to him you are born again before because foreign happy [Applause] I told you that my mother one day he
