[29:47] [Music]
[29:54] by my mom asked me to read this
[29:58] we notice the Little Flower let's take
[30:01] the significance of a little flower it
[30:04] stands up there beautiful and it serving
[30:06] a purpose serves it well and when the
[30:09] frost hits it in the fall of the year
[30:12] that's it young or old it dies that's
[30:15] death its little petals drop off and a
[30:18] little black seed drops out of it let's
[30:20] see whether God interested in what we
[30:22] are struggling for a little black seed
[30:25] drops out of it and after a while then
[30:27] it
[30:28] as strange as it seems God is so
[30:31] interested in that little life until he
[30:33] has a funeral procession for it it is
[30:36] the fall rains come great big tears drop
[30:39] down out of the skies and buries that
[30:41] little seed now is that true it sure is
[30:45] buries it under the ground Along Comes
[30:47] the winter freeze freezes over several
[30:50] inches under the ground the little Bub
[30:53] dries up freezes gone the petals drops
[30:56] off gone the leaves gone the little seat
[30:59] freezes bursts open the pulp runs out
[31:03] that poor little life that God made is
[31:05] it finished not by no means oh no see
[31:09] the solar system controls botani life
[31:12] the Sun the Su and just as soon as that
[31:15] warm sun moves from around behind the
[31:17] Earth and gets back around here there's
[31:20] a gem of Life somewhere in that that no
[31:22] scientist can find but that little
[31:24] flower lives again it served its purpose
[31:28] it lives again because it's life well if
[31:31] God made a way for the solar system to
[31:33] raise up again a life that saved him
[31:36] what about the s o n when he comes with
[31:39] eternal life and we have eternal life
[31:41] we're going to rise against some of this
[31:44] days let's just serve our purpose well
[31:47] what whatever we are let's serve let's
[31:49] serve
[31:50] it whatever Place God put you let's
[31:54] serve it for the Sun is going to rise
[31:56] one of these days with heing in his
[31:58] wings I want to come forth then in the

[46:57] through which you speak to us and
[46:59] Heavenly Father we know that when you
[47:01] speak each and everyone will find his
[47:03] position in your word we just want to
[47:06] command the devil to step back and to go
[47:09] back to hell where he belongs because
[47:12] his place is not here amen Lord even if
[47:14] even as he doesn't have a place in your
[47:17] word so now we are gathered here around
[47:19] your word and we believe that it will
[47:21] just be a meeting between you and your
[47:23] bride this morning as we commit the
[47:26] service into your hands in Jesus name
[47:27] amen amen thank you you may be seated
[47:31] God
[47:35] bless okay like I said
[47:40] yesterday that yes we I think we all
[47:43] know brother
[47:46] Victor he was very
[47:53] notorious on the issue of the
[47:57] hatred
[48:01] Ministry of the
[48:05] underworld so most people hate that
[48:10] Ministry without understanding what's
[48:13] going
[48:15] on so brother
[48:18] Victor he understood
[48:22] it because his father
[48:27] went through those uh part of
[48:33] way of course there are
[48:37] families that want to help their
[48:43] families trying to assist them when they
[48:46] are in a
[48:50] situation only to find that they take
[48:53] them to the wrong people
[48:58] those people initiate
[49:01] them they'll be serving the kingdom of
[49:04] the devil unknowingly some of
[49:09] them and it becomes very
[49:13] difficult to retrieve him back that
[49:18] person and at times when you retrieve
[49:20] him
[49:23] back some people will criticize you
[49:28] and uh not understanding what is going
[49:33] on so we're
[49:35] living at that
[49:39] time but our brother we used to go
[49:43] together with
[49:45] him in trying to assist
[49:49] such may the Lord bless
[49:52] you so let's just uh have some few words
[49:57] of
[50:00] comfort to the
[50:02] family I also know the
[50:06] family may the Lord bless
[50:08] you right we just read the scripture
[50:13] here what is very important about this
[50:18] scripture it start by saying behold I
[50:22] show you a mystery
[50:27] now if you could look at it
[50:31] carefully it says s h e u i show you a
[50:41] mystery right
[50:44] amen uh we shall not all
[50:49] sleep but we shall all be changed
[50:57] now this scripture doesn't say we shall
[51:00] all
[51:03] die no it says we shall not all sleep it
[51:08] doesn't say we shall not all
[51:15] die are we
[51:17] together so which
[51:20] means those that have
[51:23] departed they are asleep
[51:28] they are not
[51:29] dead they are
[51:32] asleep the prophet
[51:34] says when you are dead is when you are
[51:38] separated from
[51:41] God it's when you will never never be
[51:48] able to see God in your
[51:52] life you have crossed the line
[51:56] we are
[51:58] dead are we together amen now it
[52:03] says we shall not all
[52:08] sleep but we shall all be
[52:13] changed that
[52:15] means there are those that will
[52:20] sleep there are those that will
[52:24] change like I said yesterday
[52:27] those that are
[52:30] asleep they've gone before
[52:34] us they are
[52:36] gone but they are
[52:41] asleep uh yesterday we read the
[52:45] Scripture it speaks about two
[52:49] bodies that scripture start by
[52:53] describing the Flesh of the birs
[53:00] and the Flesh of all the animals that
[53:03] are on the
[53:06] ground and the Flesh of all those that
[53:09] are in the
[53:13] sea then it speaks about the
[53:18] [Music]
[53:19] bodies there's a body that we are
[53:22] wearing it's called terrestrial body
[53:29] and when you get out of this
[53:32] body you put you on another
[53:35] body it's the Bible that says
[53:38] so which is the celestial
[53:41] body that is why the
[53:46] sist they could not believe in the
[53:51] resurrection when somebody
[53:54] depart he's not
[53:58] dead and we have
[54:02] dimensions and then these
[54:07] dimensions are in this
[54:11] way you being the
[54:15] body the
[54:16] spirit and the
[54:20] soul and then we have the two
[54:25] kingdoms the kingdom of the
[54:28] devil and the kingdom of
[54:31] God so it all
[54:34] depends on the kingdom that you were
[54:37] saving whil you were in this planet
[54:43] Earth and when you
[54:46] depart
[54:49] obviously you cannot go to
[54:52] God but everybody that departs
[54:56] even if he serves
[54:58] God but he does not go directly to
[55:02] God he's going to
[55:05] wait then he put a
[55:08] body where he'll be
[55:10] waiting in a different
[55:13] place you remember Abra I mean the the
[55:18] rich
[55:20] man and Lazarus I think the rich man's
[55:23] name was Divas
[55:27] they both
[55:29] died but they went into two
[55:33] different one went to
[55:36] Paradise the other one went to
[55:39] Ides see the one that was in
[55:42] Ides was in
[55:44] torment the one was in Paradise was in
[55:49] relaxation that is exactly what
[55:51] happens now those that were in Paradise
[55:56] when our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:59] died the book of
[56:02] Peter uh says I think it's chapter 3:
[56:08] 19 his soul our Lord's
[56:12] soul went to
[56:17] hies and then just to preach to those
[56:20] Souls that repented
[56:24] not and then from he went to
[56:28] paradise and took those
[56:31] Souls from
[56:34] Paradise
[56:36] because those Souls that were in
[56:40] Paradise were not washed by the blood of
[56:44] our Lord Jesus
[56:47] Christ so it was just the blood of uh
[56:51] the ox and
[56:55] the so so they could
[56:57] not go under the
[57:00] altar but after his blood was
[57:04] shed then he went and took Abraham Isaac
[57:08] and Jacob andbody and removed them from
[57:14] Paradise and took them under the
[57:17] altar now coming to you and
[57:22] me you and
[57:24] me it all depends with which God are we
[57:30] serving
[57:32] everybody believe that he's serving
[57:36] God but believe me not everybody is
[57:39] serving
[57:44] God
[57:45] everybody says we are serving
[57:48] God we worship I've got my own church I
[57:53] attend every day or or every week but
[57:56] not
[57:57] everybody is H by
[58:02] God right now some
[58:06] people they serve God and
[58:11] ancestors now
[58:16] innocently they think they can serve
[58:19] God and the ancestors now let me explain
[58:23] that
[58:24] issue spiritually
[58:27] the Bible says when you
[58:31] depart your body goes to the
[58:37] Grave like our brother's
[58:40] body he goes to the
[58:43] grave but your
[58:45] spirit will go to
[58:47] God
[58:49] if you serve
[58:53] God and your soul
[58:57] it's either it will go to
[59:00] hell or it's going to
[59:02] wait for
[59:05] Resurrection let's repeat that when you
[59:09] die your body goes to the
[59:12] Grave your
[59:14] soul if you sered
[59:17] God it will be under the
[59:20] altar waiting for the
[59:23] resurrection not for judgment
[59:27] waiting for the
[59:30] resurrection now the
[59:33] soul of the one that was not serving God
[59:37] correctly it will be in Hell In
[59:42] torment waiting for the
[59:45] Judgment not the
[59:48] resurrection it won't
[59:51] resurrect and what about the spirit when
[59:55] you die your spirit goes back to
[1:00:00] God now if you didn't serve
[1:00:03] God your spirit cannot go to
[1:00:07] God now what what is happening it's
[1:00:13] meing so it's absorbed by it becomes a
[1:00:16] demonic
[1:00:18] Spirit that's the one that you serve
[1:00:21] now thinking that it's your ancestors
[1:00:26] a spirit wants a
[1:00:29] body where it could dwell in even the
[1:00:33] spirit of God wants a body where it
[1:00:36] could dwell
[1:00:37] in now it will look for the body in the
[1:00:43] family and then if there's one in the
[1:00:46] family that does not serve God then uses
[1:00:50] that body and then it comes to you and
[1:00:54] you see your grandfather
[1:00:57] or your grandmother or your aunt or your
[1:01:01] grandfather then you see me will come
[1:01:03] you will see
[1:01:05] him but it has come in the form of your
[1:01:13] relative because your
[1:01:15] relative did not serve
[1:01:18] God and then you will
[1:01:21] innocently think that is your ancestors
[1:01:29] right right now the Bible says
[1:01:32] here we shall not he says it's a mystery
[1:01:36] says I'm showing you a
[1:01:38] mystery we shall not
[1:01:42] all those that are
[1:01:44] sleep they are under the
[1:01:47] altar when the time
[1:01:49] come they will come and take their
[1:01:53] body or their spirit
[1:01:56] will come and take their
[1:01:58] souls Under The Altar and go into the
[1:02:02] body they will
[1:02:05] resurrect they will resurrect and after
[1:02:08] the resurrection then we will see them
[1:02:12] and after seeing them we will together
[1:02:15] with
[1:02:16] them the bodies will change that's what
[1:02:20] we call Rapture that's what we are
[1:02:22] waiting for
[1:02:24] now waiting for the changing of the
[1:02:28] body and the body will never
[1:02:31] change without the
[1:02:33] word that will cause the body to
[1:02:37] change now when you worship God you must
[1:02:41] be
[1:02:42] aware how you worship
[1:02:44] God you must worship god with the
[1:02:48] intention that you will receive a spirit
[1:02:52] that will bring
[1:02:53] about the changing of your
[1:02:56] body not any
[1:02:59] spirit that can change your body the
[1:03:02] spirit that can can change your
[1:03:05] body is the revealed
[1:03:07] we now when I'm speaking about the
[1:03:10] revealed we I'm speaking about the word
[1:03:13] of
[1:03:14] God but the word that is
[1:03:19] revealed now what is a
[1:03:22] revelation a revelation is an
[1:03:26] understanding and the knowledge but the
[1:03:29] spiritual
[1:03:31] one the knowledge and
[1:03:34] understanding of what you should how
[1:03:37] should you pray right
[1:03:40] now what is the relationship between you
[1:03:43] and
[1:03:44] God and how should you pray him and what
[1:03:48] God wants at this
[1:03:51] time now going to the service
[1:03:56] worshiping God it's a good thing but you
[1:04:00] must have a
[1:04:02] revelation
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:06] look uh the
[1:04:08] Pharisees the
[1:04:10] sagues the
[1:04:12] scribes those were
[1:04:14] pastors those were
[1:04:16] priests they were waiting for the
[1:04:20] Messiah and Messiah
[1:04:24] came which was our Lord Jesus
[1:04:27] Christ but they were
[1:04:30] worshiping they were high priest they
[1:04:32] were in the temple they were leaders but
[1:04:35] when the Messiah came they could not see
[1:04:39] the
[1:04:40] Messiah but they were church
[1:04:44] goers now you need to
[1:04:46] know where to because they missed the
[1:04:50] Messiah they even crucified the Messiah
[1:04:53] the very same people that we're having
[1:04:58] scribes are we together now even us in
[1:05:03] order that we should have eternal life
[1:05:07] we should know where and how to worship
[1:05:14] God the
[1:05:16] departure of a person is nothing all of
[1:05:21] us it's
[1:05:23] scriptural it's scriptural I've just
[1:05:25] read it
[1:05:26] we shall not all sleep which means some
[1:05:29] will
[1:05:31] sleep so now if one of your family
[1:05:36] members it's not
[1:05:39] unfortunate it's
[1:05:41] scriptural tomorrow I might sleep
[1:05:44] also the day will come you sleep at
[1:05:47] times I might not
[1:05:50] sleep I'll be around until my body
[1:05:52] changes
[1:05:56] are we together amen so then let's read
[1:06:00] the book of
[1:06:05] John Book of John chapter
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:10] 6
[1:06:12] uh before we go to Book of John chapter
[1:06:15] 6 while we still on that book of First
[1:06:19] Corinthians my
[1:06:20] brother we
[1:06:23] read verse 51 let's go back to the
[1:06:26] scripture we read
[1:06:28] yesterday uh verse 45 go verse 45 yes
[1:06:34] and so it is written the first man Adam
[1:06:38] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[1:06:41] made a quickening spirit okay fine amen
[1:06:45] now the Bible here
[1:06:48] says the first
[1:06:51] man Adam was made a living soul
[1:06:58] and the last
[1:07:00] Adam which is Jesus was made a
[1:07:06] quickening let's explain
[1:07:10] that uh in the Book of
[1:07:14] Genesis chapter
[1:07:17] 2ter 2 vers 7 ver it says
[1:07:21] God formed
[1:07:24] men after Out of the Dust of the
[1:07:28] Earth are we together and what did he do
[1:07:33] he breathed in his
[1:07:36] nostrils then Man became a
[1:07:42] living in other
[1:07:44] words it was a
[1:07:47] body that was made of the Dust
[1:07:51] of and then it became a living soul
[1:07:58] but the second
[1:08:00] Adam the Bible says he was made a
[1:08:03] quickening
[1:08:06] spirit how was he a quickening
[1:08:10] spirit if you go to the Book of
[1:08:14] Luke let's go to the Book of
[1:08:18] Luke chapter
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:23] one verse three
[1:08:29] Luke
[1:08:35] 1 am I
[1:08:38] right no no verse
[1:08:41] 35 verse 35 can you read it for
[1:08:46] us verse 35 it says and the angel
[1:08:50] answered and said unto her the Holy
[1:08:52] Ghost shall come upon thee and and the
[1:08:55] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:08:58] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:09:02] which shall be born of the shall be
[1:09:04] called The Son of God now the first man
[1:09:09] the first
[1:09:11] Adam was uh a quickening spirit a Living
[1:09:16] spirit was was was a living Soul sorry
[1:09:19] thank
[1:09:21] you the first
[1:09:23] Adam but coming to thank
[1:09:26] but coming to the second
[1:09:29] one the spirit of
[1:09:32] God overshadowed
[1:09:36] Mary and
[1:09:38] Mary received the word
[1:09:41] from from the angel of the
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:47] Lord and and then after receiving that
[1:09:52] word and then made believe that word
[1:09:56] and after believing that
[1:09:58] we and that we formed a
[1:10:04] child in the womb of
[1:10:07] Mary and with the first
[1:10:10] Adam it was a a a
[1:10:14] soul that was put in in in a in a in a
[1:10:20] body that was made out of a
[1:10:24] dust but the second one became a
[1:10:28] quickening
[1:10:29] spirit that's why I want us to
[1:10:33] read chapter 6 of John to to to to just
[1:10:38] explain these
[1:10:40] things you see if one of us
[1:10:44] depart like I said
[1:10:48] yesterday it's
[1:10:51] painful but it's not a natural pain
[1:10:56] are we together it is
[1:10:59] painful but it's not a natural
[1:11:03] pain it's like going to
[1:11:06] hell it's
[1:11:08] painful it's not a natural
[1:11:12] pain it's like the fire of
[1:11:17] God it's it's a very painful
[1:11:21] fire it's not like the fire that you at
[1:11:25] your
[1:11:27] home you see if you take your finger and
[1:11:29] put it in the
[1:11:31] fire you'll burn is very
[1:11:34] painful but the fire of
[1:11:38] God it's something
[1:11:40] else and the pain that you feel when you
[1:11:44] are
[1:11:47] injured or when you are sick the pain
[1:11:50] that is in your
[1:11:52] body it's not like the pain that that
[1:11:55] you see when you are in torment in
[1:12:00] heav when you are in
[1:12:03] torment it's a supernatural
[1:12:07] pain you cannot explain it to a a human
[1:12:12] being unless you go to torment
[1:12:16] itself are we together amen now we are
[1:12:19] here we are
[1:12:21] divided some believe in God some don't
[1:12:24] believe in God
[1:12:27] now those that don't that believe in
[1:12:32] God they believe in God by
[1:12:36] faith they've never seen God with their
[1:12:38] Naked
[1:12:40] Eyes they've never seen New Jerusalem
[1:12:44] with
[1:12:46] their with the faith that is in
[1:12:50] them that
[1:12:52] Faith it's a it's a they got it from God
[1:12:57] it's a blessing from
[1:12:59] God God revealed it but it doesn't show
[1:13:04] you a
[1:13:05] picture he gave you a supernatural
[1:13:09] strength which we call
[1:13:12] Faith that is why the Bible says without
[1:13:17] faith you can't please
[1:13:20] go faith is to
[1:13:23] believe on something that you don't
[1:13:27] see but you believe in you believe in it
[1:13:29] in such a way
[1:13:31] that you can even see it even if you
[1:13:34] don't see
[1:13:35] it are we together okay fine I said we
[1:13:40] should read uh John chapter 6 amen uh
[1:13:44] let's read
[1:13:46] verse let's start by reading verse
[1:13:50] 53 John 6 ver 53 53- 54
[1:13:56] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:13:59] I say unto you except he eat the Flesh
[1:14:02] of the son of men and drink his blood ye
[1:14:05] have no life in you who so eateth my
[1:14:09] flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal
[1:14:12] life and I will raise him up at the last
[1:14:16] day right now he says then Jesus said
[1:14:19] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[1:14:23] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:14:27] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:14:31] in
[1:14:40] you we we we touched that
[1:14:45] yesterday but
[1:14:47] now uh when he speaks about
[1:14:52] eating the Flesh of a son of man he's
[1:14:57] speaking about the word of
[1:15:00] God now he says except you
[1:15:05] eat the
[1:15:08] Flesh of the son of
[1:15:11] man and drink the
[1:15:14] blood you have no life In
[1:15:18] You Now by that he
[1:15:22] means when you read the Bible
[1:15:26] the word of
[1:15:27] God we are
[1:15:29] eating because the Bible says in the in
[1:15:33] the beginning was the
[1:15:35] word the word was with God the word is
[1:15:41] God the word is God he that finds
[1:15:46] me so the word is God you are
[1:15:52] reading so I was saying to somebody
[1:15:57] I said you don't read a
[1:16:01] Bible
[1:16:02] like okay we just read it
[1:16:08] just for
[1:16:12] fun some other
[1:16:20] songs no there's no sense in that song
[1:16:27] there's no anointing you just
[1:16:31] say I'm just saying that amen so now
[1:16:35] there are some other people who will
[1:16:37] just read a
[1:16:38] Bible and when they read it it's a good
[1:16:42] book it's nice
[1:16:46] nice Jesus the and he raised Mary I mean
[1:16:50] he
[1:16:52] raised the Dead
[1:16:57] Lazarus so he's just reading
[1:17:00] that it becomes just a
[1:17:03] knowledge but the
[1:17:05] Bible should be
[1:17:09] read according to uh you know we are
[1:17:14] living at this time
[1:17:17] now it should be relevant with the time
[1:17:20] that you are living in
[1:17:25] if you read about the children of Israel
[1:17:27] crossing the Red
[1:17:30] River just reading is good but you have
[1:17:34] to read about the relevant thing
[1:17:38] and and even look at them and see
[1:17:41] them during the time of
[1:17:43] Jesus the
[1:17:47] relevancy was that the Messiah is
[1:17:51] here and some were waiting for them
[1:17:55] Messiah so they were
[1:17:59] irrelevant but they were doing a good
[1:18:02] thing waiting for the
[1:18:05] Messiah but they they were they were
[1:18:07] wrong Messiah was
[1:18:11] working are we
[1:18:13] together now when it says You must eat
[1:18:17] the Flesh of the son
[1:18:19] of it means it must be a relevant thing
[1:18:26] the
[1:18:27] scripture that will bring life into
[1:18:31] you and bring a change in your
[1:18:34] life when you read it you look and
[1:18:38] see when it says in such and such time
[1:18:43] this and this and this will happen you
[1:18:45] will see them happening now you are
[1:18:48] relevant with the
[1:18:51] scriptures you don't just read
[1:18:55] that's why now it says
[1:18:58] here you can never read and
[1:19:02] understand without the blood it says you
[1:19:06] you you you eat that you read and you
[1:19:10] drink I read you a scripture
[1:19:14] yesterday that now the blood types the
[1:19:17] spirit of
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] God that's the one that interprets
[1:19:23] it and when do you get the spirit of God
[1:19:27] it's a gift God gives
[1:19:29] you because you are
[1:19:32] predestinated God will give
[1:19:36] you are we together he will give you
[1:19:41] to that's
[1:19:43] God when we talking about the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost you don't go you don't have to go
[1:19:49] to a
[1:19:51] mountain and go and pray
[1:19:55] there are people that will go around and
[1:19:57] pray a lot and
[1:20:00] say just find out the time that you
[1:20:03] living
[1:20:04] in and what does the scripture says
[1:20:06] about the
[1:20:08] time then all your problems will be
[1:20:12] so
[1:20:15] look
[1:20:16] even when you are
[1:20:19] sick if you get the right scriptures
[1:20:23] that
[1:20:24] that are relevant with your
[1:20:28] life you get you get
[1:20:31] healed I would say even if you touch the
[1:20:36] child of
[1:20:37] God who has the connection of
[1:20:42] God then you get healed because that
[1:20:47] is okay let me put it this
[1:20:49] way uh God lives in a man
[1:20:57] Elijah touched
[1:20:59] Elish he didn't say a thing just touched
[1:21:03] el el followed
[1:21:07] him you know that
[1:21:09] lady that
[1:21:12] woman that touched the seam of the
[1:21:15] Garment
[1:21:16] of just touched that and then there was
[1:21:19] a
[1:21:22] pool are we together and even if you
[1:21:25] fight against such a
[1:21:27] person you're fighting against God
[1:21:30] because God dwells in that
[1:21:32] man and God want to show
[1:21:37] himself but because he's a
[1:21:39] spirit now he dwells in a man and that
[1:21:43] man becomes God when you touch that man
[1:21:46] you are touching
[1:21:48] God are we together amen because the
[1:21:52] word of God is in that
[1:21:56] amen are we together amen now who so it
[1:22:00] verse
[1:22:02] 54 eateth My Flesh and drink my blood
[1:22:07] you know now what what is to eat
[1:22:10] flesh and you know what is to drink
[1:22:14] blood has eternal life that's what he
[1:22:18] says you eat the flesh you drink the
[1:22:22] blood but be careful
[1:22:25] how you eat that flesh it must be
[1:22:31] irrelevant with a event with a
[1:22:35] event it should be the right
[1:22:38] event and then you'll get the spirit of
[1:22:41] God but if it's not
[1:22:44] relevant then you when we speak about
[1:22:48] the
[1:22:49] Revelation the Revelation comes to you
[1:22:52] through the spirit of God
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] that's why we call it the Holy Spirit
[1:22:59] now the holy spirit it's not to speak in
[1:23:02] tongues and roll around and do all those
[1:23:04] things no no the holy spirit is an
[1:23:10] explanation that God gives you and that
[1:23:14] explanation is known only by you when
[1:23:18] when we when we talk about the re
[1:23:20] Revelation it's your new name
[1:23:24] a revelation is your new
[1:23:27] name and when you have a
[1:23:30] revelation you know you have
[1:23:33] a
[1:23:35] look going to heaven you know if you
[1:23:38] don't go to heaven
[1:23:40] that when you look at yourself say I
[1:23:44] don't think I'll make it I need to make
[1:23:46] that thing that thing that
[1:23:48] thing but when you are ready you know
[1:23:51] what mean I'm going to heaven come with
[1:23:55] me I am
[1:23:56] to you know yourself and if you can't
[1:24:00] you know I must Rectify
[1:24:03] some are we together now that's what we
[1:24:06] call a
[1:24:07] revelation that's what we call your new
[1:24:11] name it's you
[1:24:14] alone that knows how are we
[1:24:18] together it is you don't go to
[1:24:22] heaven as a group
[1:24:26] or as a
[1:24:27] family or as a
[1:24:29] church no it's an
[1:24:33] individual we can be a
[1:24:35] church all of
[1:24:37] us but some might take a wrong
[1:24:41] direction are we together that's how it
[1:24:46] is so now let's go to the the book of uh
[1:24:52] uh John
[1:24:55] chapter 6 chapter 6 we we read did you
[1:25:00] read it verse 63 let's read verse 63
[1:25:03] verse
[1:25:05] 63
[1:25:06] says we on John 6 yes yes it is the
[1:25:10] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:25:13] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[1:25:16] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:25:20] life yeah you see now Paul says here
[1:25:24] Paul
[1:25:26] it is the spirit that quickened 63
[1:25:31] yes the spirit that Quicken
[1:25:34] it that's why we said the the second
[1:25:41] Adam was a quickening
[1:25:44] spirit right it is the spirit that
[1:25:49] quickened the flesh profited nothing
[1:25:56] you see that is why the flesh we take it
[1:25:58] back to where it comes
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:01] from it
[1:26:04] profited but now he
[1:26:06] says the words that I speak unto
[1:26:11] you they are
[1:26:13] spirit and they are
[1:26:17] life the
[1:26:19] words that I speaking to
[1:26:21] you where are those words
[1:26:26] they are here they are written
[1:26:30] here the Lord
[1:26:33] himself they are
[1:26:36] life
[1:26:38] now they are
[1:26:41] life and then it says they are
[1:26:45] Spirit
[1:26:47] right now that we are on that
[1:26:51] one let's try to take the word and put
[1:26:55] it in a human
[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:26:59] heart how do we put it in a human
[1:27:03] heart because the mystery of
[1:27:06] God is when God and man combine and be
[1:27:09] one
[1:27:11] thing that is
[1:27:14] Mystery now before there will be a
[1:27:18] creation to your
[1:27:20] heart there has to be a creator
[1:27:25] to create that
[1:27:28] creation there should be a new
[1:27:32] man that is created in your
[1:27:37] heart that is
[1:27:39] a a
[1:27:41] creation before there's that creation
[1:27:44] there should be a creator that will
[1:27:46] create
[1:27:48] that right now the prophet says
[1:27:55] uh he's speaking
[1:27:58] about the the little
[1:28:02] part that is in Your
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] Heart Right it says God when he speak to
[1:28:10] you when he
[1:28:13] created
[1:28:15] Adam he was a
[1:28:17] body and there spirit and then a Man
[1:28:22] became a living soul
[1:28:25] the soul is in the heart of a
[1:28:29] human so he
[1:28:31] says there's a little
[1:28:35] part it's a compartment in a man's
[1:28:41] heart uh God has made it in your
[1:28:44] heart there compartment in your
[1:28:48] heart that was created by
[1:28:51] God yeah then he made that in there for
[1:28:57] himself each and every one of
[1:29:00] us there is a part in your
[1:29:03] heart which was created God by God when
[1:29:07] God want to speak to you he goes to that
[1:29:11] compartment he calls it his control
[1:29:16] room you have you have a control
[1:29:21] room in your heart
[1:29:24] when God wants to pick to you he speak
[1:29:28] because in your heart there's other
[1:29:31] doubt or
[1:29:33] faith the word of God you receive it by
[1:29:38] faith all of us when we receive the word
[1:29:41] of God our friends turn their back
[1:29:44] towards
[1:29:46] us because he say ah you are no more my
[1:29:50] friend because you don't drink you don't
[1:29:52] you don't SM smoke
[1:29:55] Ste and the family turn their
[1:29:59] back now I remember when I
[1:30:03] repented they said I must go to the
[1:30:06] Mountain
[1:30:08] School I said no I'm believe I'm not
[1:30:10] going there they said no now from now
[1:30:14] on we we won't have any negotiating with
[1:30:19] you even now by then I was a young man
[1:30:24] I think I was 30 years old I think I was
[1:30:27] 30 years old today I'm 77 years old not
[1:30:32] even a single one knows my
[1:30:35] house never
[1:30:37] came but I still preach this
[1:30:40] gospel and I'm happy in
[1:30:42] this are we together amen now when you
[1:30:46] when God touches that
[1:30:50] compartment people will turn their back
[1:30:53] against
[1:30:55] and you'll be seeing what they don't
[1:30:58] see because there's something that God
[1:31:01] has
[1:31:03] touched so now when God touches your
[1:31:06] compartment you don't go together with
[1:31:08] your family there and with your friends
[1:31:12] there it's
[1:31:15] you are we together amen that becomes
[1:31:18] your baby it's you and your
[1:31:22] God so
[1:31:25] then you must be
[1:31:29] able to understand your control
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:35] room it's your control room you receive
[1:31:39] the word of God by faith
[1:31:42] thank are you together thanks my brother
[1:31:46] let me just finish here now he sets
[1:31:50] there to control you
[1:31:55] that is his
[1:31:57] place that's where he sends the message
[1:32:03] from are we
[1:32:05] together so
[1:32:08] now when he sent the
[1:32:11] message when you receive that
[1:32:13] message it forms God
[1:32:17] himself if you are a
[1:32:19] messenger I mean if the message comes
[1:32:22] into you
[1:32:24] then you become the owner of that
[1:32:27] message and then when uh your body and
[1:32:31] your
[1:32:32] spirit
[1:32:34] separates then he takes what is his back
[1:32:38] he takes his word that you have
[1:32:42] receed may the Lord bless

[2:10:30] word and remind each
[2:10:33] other and then we read the word that is
[2:10:39] relevant with what has
[2:10:44] happened
[2:10:46] so as to console the the the family
[2:10:54] and the church at
[2:10:56] L and those who were used to
[2:11:01] him okay let me start by saying yes
[2:11:11] uh
[2:11:13] was our
[2:11:16] friend as a
[2:11:19] Believer as for my myself I know him
[2:11:22] while he was still very
[2:11:26] young I used to pick him
[2:11:30] up section
[2:11:33] F take him to the service
[2:11:38] every until he got
[2:11:41] married and have children
[2:11:44] too but brother
[2:11:48] says he has been very courageous
[2:11:54] in fighting this demonic
[2:12:01] world is the first
[2:12:04] man that led the
[2:12:10] team uh to fight against these evil
[2:12:15] spirits he will take them to the rivers
[2:12:21] to cut off the
[2:12:24] connections those that have got
[2:12:29] connections to the Demonic
[2:12:32] world now he go to the
[2:12:35] place where they were
[2:12:39] initiated cut off that
[2:12:43] connection there was quite number of
[2:12:45] them amen and there's quite a number of
[2:12:48] people that were were helped
[2:12:53] you know all brothers and sisters
[2:12:57] from so we're going to read the
[2:13:02] word uh and here and say some few
[2:13:07] uh words concerning the scriptures that
[2:13:10] we have
[2:13:16] read I would like us to read from the
[2:13:19] book of First Corinthians
[2:13:30] 15 uh we'll start from verse
[2:13:40] 45 First Corinthians chapter
[2:13:45] 15 chter 15 starting from verse
[2:13:49] 45 vers 45
[2:13:52] and then up to
[2:13:54] 51
[2:13:59] 51 and so it is written the first man
[2:14:03] Adam was made a living Soul the last
[2:14:06] Adam was made a quickening spirit how B
[2:14:11] that was not
[2:14:12] first which is spiritual but that which
[2:14:16] is natural and after what that which is
[2:14:19] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[2:14:23] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[2:14:27] Heaven as it is the earthy such are they
[2:14:31] also that are earthy and as is the
[2:14:35] Heavenly such are they also that are
[2:14:38] Heavenly and as we have borne the image
[2:14:41] of the earthy we shall also bear the
[2:14:44] image of the heaven now this I say
[2:14:48] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[2:14:51] inherit the kingdom of God neither do
[2:14:54] corruption inherit
[2:14:56] incorruption behold I show you a Myster
[2:15:00] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[2:15:03] be
[2:15:05] changed okay let's just power ahead we
[2:15:08] have our
[2:15:09] Elder
[2:15:14] B will just
[2:15:17] to pray for the reading of the word
[2:15:25] [Applause]
[2:15:28] as we bow our
[2:15:31] head
[2:15:33] gracious Eternal Heavenly
[2:15:37] Father the almighty God The Great I Am
[2:15:52] even tonight we are
[2:15:56] gathered for the memorial of our brother
[2:15:59] and our Elder that
[2:16:03] Mo and we believe that the word that has
[2:16:07] been
[2:16:08] read is read for a
[2:16:11] purpose to comfort the
[2:16:14] family to comfort all the Beloved
[2:16:21] for the Bible is the only
[2:16:24] book that has ever been
[2:16:28] written that can tell us about where we
[2:16:31] come from amen Lord where we are
[2:16:36] going where we are going to spend
[2:16:41] eternity our Elder is standing in front
[2:16:44] of
[2:16:46] us anointed of the Holy Ghost to speak
[2:16:49] to us
[2:16:52] Lord God Almighty it is our prayer that
[2:16:55] you
[2:16:56] anoint each and everyone that is in
[2:17:01] here for the Holy Ghost to
[2:17:04] flow and for all of us to hear the
[2:17:09] word we know the evil
[2:17:12] one always try to take
[2:17:17] chances there was a time
[2:17:22] when the prophet of God was
[2:17:26] preaching an unbeliever was
[2:17:31] sent to challenge the
[2:17:35] preacher with the intention to hypnotize
[2:17:39] him to make him back like a
[2:17:44] dog but the man of God CAU that spirit
[2:17:51] and even so where that Spirit was
[2:17:53] hanging amen and he announced it to the
[2:17:58] church the man was paralyzed and carried
[2:18:03] out that is a
[2:18:06] warning to those that cast
[2:18:10] spells while a man of God stand on the
[2:18:13] pull pit amen for this place is an
[2:18:17] anointed place is a holy place
[2:18:21] Satan we command you to live right
[2:18:25] now you stand no
[2:18:28] chance as we
[2:18:30] commit this service unto the hand of the
[2:18:33] Lord the Almighty God for we believe
[2:18:38] that the word that would proceed
[2:18:41] here shall not return unto us
[2:18:44] void but it will accomplish that which
[2:18:47] is will please God
[2:18:50] father God we commit everything unto
[2:18:53] thee in the mighty name of our Lord and
[2:18:56] Savior Jesus Christ
[2:19:03] amen or you may be
[2:19:09] seated yeah we have read the
[2:19:15] word especially where the Bible says
[2:19:22] the first Adam was
[2:19:27] a it speak speak about the first Adam
[2:19:31] and the second
[2:19:32] Adam but before I go there I would like
[2:19:36] to compare what I've been
[2:19:42] reading what what we have
[2:19:45] read with Luke chapter
[2:19:49] 10 L chapter 10 we can start reading
[2:19:54] from verse
[2:19:55] 20 or can we can read only verse 20 and
[2:19:59] compare these
[2:20:00] two Luke 10 we read verse
[2:20:04] 20 not not withstanding in this Rejoice
[2:20:10] not that the spirits are subject unto
[2:20:13] you but rather Rejoice because your
[2:20:16] names are written in
[2:20:18] heaven yeah now what happened here
[2:20:23] our Lord Jesus
[2:20:25] Christ gave his disciples
[2:20:29] power to go and fight the evil
[2:20:35] spirits they did fight the evil
[2:20:39] spirit the the disciples did fight the
[2:20:43] evil
[2:20:46] spirit and defeated
[2:20:49] them and they came came back to him very
[2:20:53] happy
[2:20:56] so now he said to
[2:21:00] them uh not withstanding in this Rejoice
[2:21:04] Rejoice
[2:21:07] not that the spirits are subject unto
[2:21:13] you but rather
[2:21:16] Rejoice because your names are written
[2:21:19] in heaven
[2:21:22] so my title will be uh uh the preserved
[2:21:27] and uh registered names in
[2:21:32] [Applause]
[2:21:35] heaven because here what he
[2:21:39] says he says your name are written in
[2:21:44] heaven now if the names are written in
[2:21:48] heaven then they are preserved in
[2:21:53] heaven and then they are registered in
[2:21:57] heaven so now
[2:22:01] death is nothing is nothing compared to
[2:22:05] that because once your name is
[2:22:10] preserved and is
[2:22:14] registered nobody can do any okay what
[2:22:17] we call death here on on this planet
[2:22:20] Earth
[2:22:23] it's just the departure of an
[2:22:28] individual is that
[2:22:31] we
[2:22:33] uh we had that
[2:22:38] ignorance we had that ignorance that
[2:22:41] when somebody has passed
[2:22:45] on we think that that somebody is dead
[2:22:50] but actually is not
[2:22:53] dead it's just a
[2:22:56] departure the soul took its own
[2:23:01] Direction the spirit took his own
[2:23:05] Direction and the body took its own
[2:23:09] direction we know very
[2:23:11] well that all of
[2:23:14] us are going to soal die
[2:23:21] but actually it's just a
[2:23:24] departure and the Bible
[2:23:27] says this
[2:23:29] Flesh and Blood shall not
[2:23:34] inherit the kingdom of
[2:23:38] God
[2:23:40] now the prophet
[2:23:43] says you know one day Pastor M
[2:23:47] said said why when we meet we've got
[2:23:51] when we have
[2:23:55] funerals why don't we preach like we
[2:23:57] preach every
[2:24:02] Sunday he says now if there is a funeral
[2:24:06] of the
[2:24:09] Catholics they do their Catholic
[2:24:14] thing if there's a funeral of the
[2:24:18] zc they will you with
[2:24:21] water you came to
[2:24:25] their but we message
[2:24:29] Believers we sort of
[2:24:32] uh back
[2:24:35] up okay fine so now I will preach the
[2:24:39] way I preach every
[2:24:42] Sunday now I will read a certain
[2:24:48] portion where the prophets
[2:24:51] says only those that are written in the
[2:24:54] Lamb's Book of
[2:24:58] Life by being
[2:25:02] redeemed right because the Bible says
[2:25:06] except a
[2:25:07] man be born
[2:25:10] again he will not enter into a
[2:25:14] kingdom now he says only
[2:25:17] those who are in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:25:23] by being
[2:25:25] redeemed when when Jesus
[2:25:29] Christ uh came here on
[2:25:32] Earth he was not coming to show off
[2:25:39] himself he was here to reveal the
[2:25:43] [Applause]
[2:25:44] word now the revelation of the
[2:25:47] word was that people
[2:25:50] must receive that
[2:25:52] weight and when they receive that weight
[2:25:56] they receive
[2:25:57] life because the Bible
[2:26:00] says who he who finds
[2:26:03] me find
[2:26:06] life now now what is happening is that
[2:26:09] now the word must be
[2:26:14] incarnated into a human
[2:26:18] being and then that word
[2:26:21] itself then gives that person
[2:26:25] life in in John
[2:26:30] 17 yeah remember here he says don't be
[2:26:35] happy because the
[2:26:38] demons runs away from
[2:26:41] you
[2:26:43] but what is important is that you must
[2:26:48] Rejoice because your
[2:26:52] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[2:26:58] Life After the
[2:27:01] resurrection he went
[2:27:04] up and then when he went
[2:27:06] up and then he sent the spirit
[2:27:12] down and then the spirit down he
[2:27:14] redeemed Us by that blood and the spirit
[2:27:21] remember one day he
[2:27:23] said he took a
[2:27:27] bread and gave his
[2:27:29] disciples at
[2:27:32] it this is my
[2:27:37] flesh and then took
[2:27:40] wine and gave them and say eat this is
[2:27:45] my blood drink this is my
[2:27:48] blood so they at his
[2:27:51] flesh and drank his blood but he never
[2:27:55] explain
[2:27:57] that now his
[2:28:00] flesh or
[2:28:03] bread it means the
[2:28:07] we the
[2:28:09] spirit means the blood I mean the the
[2:28:13] wine means the
[2:28:15] blood are we together so now he cleans
[2:28:20] his
[2:28:23] church by his
[2:28:25] blood now when he cleans his blood by
[2:28:29] his I mean his church by his
[2:28:33] blood the word that is
[2:28:36] preached it become too difficult
[2:28:39] for a human
[2:28:41] [Applause]
[2:28:44] mind it must go to a human
[2:28:48] heart and then should be a
[2:28:51] spirit that come and
[2:28:55] interpret that word like in the book of
[2:28:59] First Corinthians I mean first I mean
[2:29:02] Ephesians chapter
[2:29:04] 1 Ephesians chapter
[2:29:09] 1 if you read verse 17 verse 17 yes
[2:29:13] verse
[2:29:15] 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:29:20] the father of Glory may give unto you
[2:29:23] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[2:29:27] the knowledge of see the he must give
[2:29:31] unto you the spirit of
[2:29:35] [Applause]
[2:29:37] wisdom and
[2:29:39] Revelation in the knowledge of him
[2:29:42] there's a
[2:29:44] spirit that will give you
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:48] wisdom and the revelation
[2:29:51] in the
[2:29:52] knowledge of him in other words you must
[2:29:55] have a
[2:29:57] knowledge of him but not through your
[2:30:01] mind there's a spirit that must give you
[2:30:04] that
[2:30:06] Revelation are we together now let's go
[2:30:11] back now we are talking about the
[2:30:15] preserved and
[2:30:17] registered names in heaven
[2:30:23] [Music]
[2:30:24] if somebody
[2:30:27] depart we don't have to worry
[2:30:30] that the only worry that can
[2:30:34] come is that we are used to
[2:30:38] him it it become
[2:30:41] difficult to accept his
[2:30:45] departure but as far as you know you
[2:30:48] need to know where you come from
[2:30:51] from and where you
[2:30:54] are and where you are
[2:30:57] going you don't just leave you always
[2:31:00] look back where you come
[2:31:02] from and then see where you
[2:31:06] are then if you
[2:31:08] compare from where you come
[2:31:11] from to where you are you will see that
[2:31:15] there's
[2:31:18] Grace God was mer to you because where
[2:31:22] you come from you didn't know
[2:31:25] him and where you are
[2:31:28] now you know him and then that gives you
[2:31:32] now the
[2:31:35] forecast you know exactly where you are
[2:31:40] going you are you are waiting for the
[2:31:43] Rapture and while you waiting for the
[2:31:46] repture you
[2:31:48] know that you need to have a rapturing
[2:31:53] faith right and you know how to have
[2:31:58] that rapturing
[2:31:59] Fai now when you look at back where you
[2:32:02] come
[2:32:04] from and and when you are here now you
[2:32:07] become very
[2:32:09] happy because you have the
[2:32:12] Revelation and there are people who
[2:32:16] doesn't see what you see
[2:32:19] haven't heard what we are hearing every
[2:32:23] Sunday are we together so now that is
[2:32:26] why he says now only those who are
[2:32:30] written in the Lamb's Book of
[2:32:33] Life by being
[2:32:36] redeemed right then in Revelation
[2:32:41] 20 I'll just quote these
[2:32:45] scriptures
[2:32:46] uh it
[2:32:48] says and whosoever was not found written
[2:32:52] in the Book of Life was cast into the
[2:32:54] Lake of
[2:32:57] [Applause]
[2:32:59] Fire now that that tells you about the
[2:33:02] future
[2:33:04] now you know where you
[2:33:07] are and the Bible tells you
[2:33:10] that whosoever was not
[2:33:14] found written in that
[2:33:16] book then will be cast into the Lake of
[2:33:19] Fire
[2:33:21] then you know that now if you are not if
[2:33:24] you read Ephesians
[2:33:26] 1 verse 4 you know that the pastor
[2:33:29] always read that he says according as he
[2:33:33] had chosen Us in
[2:33:37] him before the foundation of the
[2:33:40] world that we should
[2:33:42] behold and Without
[2:33:44] Blame before him in love now now the
[2:33:50] preserved and registered names in
[2:33:54] heaven have been
[2:33:57] chosen in him before the foundation of
[2:34:00] the
[2:34:01] world you you won't change
[2:34:04] that it's it's a
[2:34:08] predestination it's according as he has
[2:34:11] chosen Us
[2:34:12] in in
[2:34:15] himself before the foundation of the
[2:34:17] world that we should be
[2:34:21] holy and Without
[2:34:24] Blame before him now that thing you
[2:34:27] cannot make yourself
[2:34:30] holy it's him who has predestinated
[2:34:35] you now he has
[2:34:38] preserved and registered your
[2:34:41] name in heaven now now every
[2:34:46] Sunday the pastor reads this scripture
[2:34:50] in Revelation 2 revation 2 you know that
[2:34:53] verse 17 that he who
[2:34:59] overcomes now in other words you need to
[2:35:04] overcome then he said I will give him a
[2:35:07] hidden
[2:35:09] man not just an ordinary
[2:35:13] manner a hidden
[2:35:17] man now because you have preserved
[2:35:21] that man is preserved only for
[2:35:26] you and then you have to overcome not by
[2:35:32] yourself you are
[2:35:36] predestinated as an
[2:35:38] overcome right and then verse five he
[2:35:43] said having predestinated us
[2:35:49] unto the adoption of of
[2:35:53] children by Jesus Christ to
[2:35:57] himself according to the good pleasure
[2:36:00] of his
[2:36:02] will now let us understand
[2:36:05] that he says he do
[2:36:09] things he God do things according to his
[2:36:16] good pleasure
[2:36:17] [Applause]
[2:36:20] now he do things according his good
[2:36:25] pleasure and then what are those things
[2:36:28] he predestinated
[2:36:31] us now and he has chosen Us in
[2:36:36] himself now that is why
[2:36:38] now we worship
[2:36:41] God we worship God because he himself
[2:36:47] has called us you know the scripture
[2:36:49] he he he that he
[2:36:52] knew then he called them then he that
[2:36:56] has called them he predestinated
[2:37:00] them to a preserved
[2:37:03] life to a preserved and registered names
[2:37:07] in
[2:37:10] heaven the pastor taught us about the
[2:37:12] citizens of
[2:37:15] Heaven now the citizens of Heaven will
[2:37:19] start the citizenship here on
[2:37:23] Earth are we
[2:37:25] together
[2:37:27] Abraham started his
[2:37:32] citizenship here on Earth and the
[2:37:36] bride start his citizens her
[2:37:41] citizenship sh on
[2:37:44] Earth you remember about Revelation
[2:37:48] chapter 5
[2:37:50] it says he took the
[2:37:55] book that is the book of
[2:37:58] redemption now that book of
[2:38:00] redemption our names are written in that
[2:38:05] book then if our names are WR in
[2:38:08] that what
[2:38:10] happened
[2:38:14] after he was through with his seven
[2:38:17] Church ages
[2:38:21] then he came down with the
[2:38:24] book and then he's
[2:38:27] calling people by the names that are
[2:38:31] written on that
[2:38:33] book are we together he has finished his
[2:38:37] job now he's he's having a
[2:38:40] book now he's calling
[2:38:43] people according to their
[2:38:47] preserved preserved and register
[2:38:50] names which are in heaven so now if your
[2:38:55] name is
[2:38:57] preserved and
[2:38:58] registered in heaven there's no way that
[2:39:02] you'll miss
[2:39:03] it you you won't miss a
[2:39:08] direction he said my sheep hear my
[2:39:15] voice and when they hear my voice what
[2:39:18] will they do
[2:39:20] they will follow
[2:39:21] me they will follow me so you follow him
[2:39:25] because you
[2:39:27] he his
[2:39:30] voice right let
[2:39:32] me give you another
[2:39:36] example there's a time where our Lord
[2:39:40] Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter
[2:39:43] 25 he spoke about the wise and the
[2:39:46] foolish virgin
[2:39:50] you know about that but I'm going to
[2:39:53] read only two verses there in verse
[2:39:57] 10 chapter 25 2 it
[2:40:01] says it
[2:40:03] says and while they went to
[2:40:08] buy the bridegroom
[2:40:11] came and they that were ready went in
[2:40:15] with
[2:40:17] him to the
[2:40:20] [Applause]
[2:40:21] reach and the doors were shut was
[2:40:25] shut you know about the 10 foolish
[2:40:30] virgin five were wise five were
[2:40:35] fish they they were waiting
[2:40:39] for uh the the the
[2:40:43] bridegroom then he says when the
[2:40:45] bridegroom comes
[2:40:49] those that don't have
[2:40:51] oil went to
[2:40:54] buy while they were
[2:40:57] out the bridegroom
[2:41:00] came that they were ready they went in
[2:41:03] with
[2:41:05] him in the
[2:41:07] marriage and the door was
[2:41:11] shut then shall the king say unto them
[2:41:14] in verse
[2:41:16] 34 on the right now is the judgment
[2:41:23] Come Ye blessed of my
[2:41:27] father inherit the
[2:41:30] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[2:41:33] foundation of the
[2:41:36] world you see I
[2:41:40] said my my my my title is the preserved
[2:41:46] and registered names in heaven
[2:41:52] now he will
[2:41:54] say
[2:41:56] come you blessed of my
[2:41:59] father now he says now inherit the
[2:42:03] Kingdom that was
[2:42:06] prepared for you
[2:42:09] [Applause]
[2:42:10] when from the foundation of the
[2:42:14] world now your
[2:42:17] kingdom was prepared for
[2:42:20] you before the foundation of the
[2:42:23] world and there's no
[2:42:25] way that you will miss the the
[2:42:28] citizenship of
[2:42:32] the are we together and in verse
[2:42:36] 411 and and he shall say unto them on
[2:42:40] the left
[2:42:43] hand depart from
[2:42:46] me you cast
[2:42:49] [Applause]
[2:42:51] into the Everlasting
[2:42:54] fire prepared for the devil and his
[2:43:00] angels while we are
[2:43:05] worshiping we are
[2:43:09] aware that there are
[2:43:13] those that uh will take a different
[2:43:16] direction
[2:43:20] uh if you can read with me in in
[2:43:24] Jude in the book of of
[2:43:28] Jude read I'll read only uh verse four
[2:43:33] now you see you've got two
[2:43:36] types there are
[2:43:39] those that
[2:43:41] their uh names are not preserved in
[2:43:47] heaven and you say you hear what he says
[2:43:50] he says depart from
[2:43:53] me ye cast he says they
[2:43:57] Cur they are cast into Everlasting
[2:44:02] fire and the the other ones he said they
[2:44:06] are blessed of the
[2:44:08] father they inherit the
[2:44:11] Kingdom that was prepared for for from
[2:44:15] the foundation of the world
[2:44:21] right now if you go to
[2:44:25] Jude in verse 4 ver it says for there
[2:44:30] are certain
[2:44:32] men crept in an a who were before old
[2:44:36] ordained to this
[2:44:46] condemnation you hear what it says it
[2:44:49] says they are
[2:44:51] ordained for this
[2:44:57] condemnation now you can you you might
[2:45:01] ask me a question and saying okay what
[2:45:04] what has that to do with the
[2:45:09] funeral and what has it got to do with
[2:45:12] the memorial
[2:45:15] service now I said when we started here
[2:45:20] that a memorial
[2:45:23] service has to is to do to do with the
[2:45:27] Departed
[2:45:30] one now what we are reading
[2:45:33] here is what he used to
[2:45:37] hear now we are reading this in his
[2:45:42] memory because we used to Fellowship
[2:45:45] about these
[2:45:46] things he used to sit down and this
[2:45:49] things were were
[2:45:50] preached he knew that there is a
[2:45:55] bride and there is a
[2:45:57] church he knew that there is a a
[2:46:01] predestinated
[2:46:04] seat there is a cured
[2:46:07] people he knew that there are those who
[2:46:11] are ordained for
[2:46:15] condemnation there are those who are
[2:46:18] predestined
[2:46:20] inated for a life if you go to verse 6
[2:46:23] it says and the angels which kept not
[2:46:26] their first estate but left their own
[2:46:29] habitation he had reserved in
[2:46:32] Everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[2:46:36] the Judgment of the great day
[2:46:51] are we still together what I'm trying to
[2:46:54] show
[2:46:56] you is that
[2:46:58] now you won't miss
[2:47:02] it if your name is
[2:47:05] preserved and if your name is in the
[2:47:08] Lamb's Book of
[2:47:10] Life so when you
[2:47:14] depart we will have a natural H pain
[2:47:21] natural pain but the
[2:47:25] Comfort it should be the spiritual
[2:47:30] one I always
[2:47:32] say when somebody has lost the one that
[2:47:37] he he or she
[2:47:38] [Music]
[2:47:41] loved the only way of comforting that
[2:47:45] individual is to go to the Bible
[2:47:49] and and and check the promises of
[2:47:53] God but the natural
[2:47:57] part you can't you can't you
[2:48:02] can't uh what do we say if somebody
[2:48:05] feels the
[2:48:07] pain it's not the natural pain like
[2:48:10] somebody who is
[2:48:11] [Music]
[2:48:13] injured if somebody feels a natural
[2:48:17] pain you'll give him
[2:48:21] tablets or
[2:48:23] injection or you
[2:48:25] bandage but now the spiritual
[2:48:30] pain need a spiritual
[2:48:34] bondage and the spiritual
[2:48:37] bandage it's a
[2:48:40] supernatural you go right to where his
[2:48:43] soul
[2:48:45] is and feed that soul with the truth
[2:48:51] look youve got soul a body and Body Soul
[2:48:55] and Spirit once once the
[2:48:59] soul gets the
[2:49:01] truth and then that's the the the
[2:49:04] greatest
[2:49:07] bandage because that's where you
[2:49:10] are that's that's who you
[2:49:15] are are we together yeah
[2:49:19] because the prophet says the bride is
[2:49:21] himself
[2:49:26] revealed see so we're talking about
[2:49:30] those
[2:49:33] that took the wrong
[2:49:36] direction and those that took the right
[2:49:39] direction and then he says the rest was
[2:49:41] left for tribulation
[2:49:46] period whipping and wailing nation
[2:49:50] of and then he says that's the church
[2:49:53] not the
[2:49:55] bride let me tell you what's the
[2:49:57] difference between the church
[2:50:01] and our Lord Jesus
[2:50:05] Christ came there were Pharisees there
[2:50:07] were
[2:50:08] SES and there were there were
[2:50:11] scribes now the the
[2:50:15] SES did not believe in the res
[2:50:21] Resurrection no they they did not
[2:50:23] believe in the
[2:50:25] resurrection they say when you are dead
[2:50:28] we are
[2:50:29] dead you
[2:50:31] see and
[2:50:33] then do those Paul called them
[2:50:40] fools the scripture that we just read in
[2:50:43] in in in in in in uh First Corinthian
[2:50:48] Paul
[2:50:51] says when you when you plant a
[2:50:55] seed that se must
[2:50:58] die so that it could give
[2:51:02] life so says now you
[2:51:05] fools you don't have an
[2:51:09] understanding okay fine what he's trying
[2:51:11] to say is that now there should be a
[2:51:16] seed in you
[2:51:19] the seed which is the weed in
[2:51:23] you and that
[2:51:26] seed uh must spare of its
[2:51:34] own let me read it so that you could
[2:51:37] understand it uh let's read John
[2:51:41] 17 I mean John 17 yes John chapter 17
[2:51:50] the difference uh uh between the the
[2:51:56] bride and the
[2:52:15] church okay chapter 17 verse
[2:52:19] one it these words spake Jesus and
[2:52:24] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[2:52:27] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[2:52:32] that thy son Also may glorify thee
[2:52:49] right
[2:52:51] now
[2:52:53] glorify he says now father the hour come
[2:52:56] glorify thy
[2:53:00] son that thy son Also may glorify
[2:53:06] thee now our Lord Jesus
[2:53:09] Christ was here on
[2:53:11] Earth so that the words that he
[2:53:16] speak should find the
[2:53:19] place you remember in
[2:53:22] John 8 verse 37 he
[2:53:27] says you say you are he says John 8:37
[2:53:32] you don't have to read it uh he says you
[2:53:35] want to kill
[2:53:38] me but you say you are the Seed of
[2:53:46] Abraham okay say say you want to kill
[2:53:50] me and yet you say you are the feet
[2:53:54] of it is
[2:53:57] because my word could not find a place
[2:54:01] in your
[2:54:02] heart see now he he he was bringing the
[2:54:07] word to the
[2:54:09] people and once that
[2:54:12] word get a place in the heart of the
[2:54:15] people
[2:54:18] then that we
[2:54:20] germinate and then when it
[2:54:23] germinates it becomes
[2:54:26] Christ now the difference
[2:54:29] now between the
[2:54:31] church and the
[2:54:34] bride the church enjoy the
[2:54:38] weed are we together but that weed
[2:54:43] cannot
[2:54:44] germinate and bring the mean and
[2:54:48] germinate and be the
[2:54:51] owner because when the word
[2:54:55] germinate it makes Christ in
[2:54:58] you and when the word makes Christ in
[2:55:01] you then you become
[2:55:05] Christ you see amen now when when he
[2:55:08] says
[2:55:10] uh glorify
[2:55:13] me he was
[2:55:15] saying the words that I preached
[2:55:20] let it be
[2:55:22] manifested into the
[2:55:25] people so that when you speak about
[2:55:30] me he speaks about the
[2:55:32] word remember there is the physical Son
[2:55:36] of
[2:55:39] God which was
[2:55:42] Jesus and there is a supernatural Son of
[2:55:45] God
[2:55:48] which is
[2:55:50] logos logos is the Son of
[2:55:54] God Jesus is the son of
[2:55:57] God you this this is
[2:56:00] Harvest is a physical Son of
[2:56:05] God but the Revelation that is in
[2:56:09] him is also the Son of
[2:56:13] God are we together amen now Jesus
[2:56:19] wanted that now look look if as he
[2:56:21] continues verse two says as thou has
[2:56:24] given him Power Over All
[2:56:30] Flesh that he should give eternal
[2:56:33] [Applause]
[2:56:35] life to as many as thou has given
[2:56:40] him so his
[2:56:43] waight when it reaches
[2:56:46] you then it the word comes from
[2:56:50] eternity in the beginning was the word
[2:56:52] the word was the word was with God the
[2:56:56] Word was
[2:56:57] God now when it comes to you it brings
[2:57:02] eternity it brings the Eternal
[2:57:07] beam and it forms the Eternal
[2:57:10] beam now it makes
[2:57:12] you the Eternal
[2:57:16] being not this flesh
[2:57:20] no it bring uh it goes to your
[2:57:24] heart and then when it gets into your
[2:57:27] heart that word itself like when when
[2:57:31] the prophet says the word is now in the
[2:57:35] bride it means then then that word which
[2:57:39] is in the
[2:57:41] bride makes that
[2:57:44] person an amature God
[2:57:48] amen are we together amen now if it
[2:57:51] makes you an amateur God then it gives
[2:57:54] you a
[2:57:55] revelation and then when it gives you a
[2:57:57] revelation says
[2:58:00] now H you'll know what to
[2:58:04] do with that
[2:58:06] Revelation now our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:58:10] wanted that
[2:58:13] people should know the
[2:58:16] word that is why if you go to uh to the
[2:58:21] day he was speaking to
[2:58:24] Peter he said to
[2:58:27] Peter H before I mean he started by
[2:58:30] saying to all who do
[2:58:33] people say that the son of man
[2:58:37] is you see he want just them to to to to
[2:58:41] to to have a
[2:58:44] revelation of who he was
[2:58:48] not not really
[2:58:51] Jesus but the word
[2:58:54] itself we together amen that's why he
[2:58:58] when he said thou are the
[2:59:01] Christ Christ and logos and the
[2:59:06] spirit it's one and the same thing
[2:59:10] Christ is logos logos is the pillar of
[2:59:14] fire logos is still the we so when he
[2:59:18] says Thou Art Christ then he was saying
[2:59:21] this was
[2:59:22] logos this was Pillar of Fire and then
[2:59:25] it was a revelation to
[2:59:27] Peter and then if if it was a revelation
[2:59:30] to
[2:59:32] Peter uh then is
[2:59:37] finished that's why he says now glorify
[2:59:40] me my last scripture my last scripture
[2:59:44] is here in the Book of Matthew
[2:59:51] uh Matthew chapter
[2:59:59] 22 from verse 41 he says while the
[3:00:04] Pharisees were gathered together Jesus
[3:00:06] asked
[3:00:10] them
[3:00:12] saying what think ye of
[3:00:16] Christ whose son is
[3:00:20] he they say unto him the son of
[3:00:24] David I'm sure you are aware that he
[3:00:27] says what think ye of
[3:00:32] Christ he doesn't say what think ye of
[3:00:37] Jesus says what think he of
[3:00:41] Christ now he was asking the
[3:00:44] Pharisees and then he said whose son was
[3:00:49] he is
[3:00:52] he and then they said is the son of
[3:00:56] David then he said unto them how then do
[3:01:01] David in spirit call him
[3:01:08] Lord saying the Lord said unto my
[3:01:13] Lord see thou on my right
[3:01:16] hand till I make thine enemies thy foood
[3:01:21] sto if David then call him
[3:01:25] Lord how is he his
[3:01:29] son verse 46 and no man was able to
[3:01:33] answer
[3:01:36] him now this
[3:01:38] question is the very same question that
[3:01:41] he ask his
[3:01:44] disciples it's the very same question
[3:01:48] so
[3:01:49] now the
[3:01:52] consolation to the
[3:01:56] moas is that
[3:02:00] uh your your the things that we
[3:02:05] preach your
[3:02:08] father engaged
[3:02:13] them and when you engage them
[3:02:20] then that gives
[3:02:24] you a supernatural
[3:02:29] encouragement that there is a citizen
[3:02:34] of New
[3:02:37] Jerusalem if there's a citizen of New
[3:02:41] Jerusalem according to the
[3:02:45] predestination we will meet there
[3:02:50] and the Bible also
[3:02:53] says
[3:02:54] uh the all those that
[3:02:59] slept they will they will
[3:03:03] rise and then we will see
[3:03:06] them and then our bodies will
[3:03:10] change now this ministry that you are
[3:03:14] having the ministry of the revelation of
[3:03:17] the seventh
[3:03:20] seal which is the power of the third
[3:03:23] pool gives
[3:03:26] you uh it inspires
[3:03:31] you as his as his
[3:03:34] children that's where you get the the
[3:03:37] rapturing
[3:03:39] faith the Bible the Bible speaks
[3:03:43] about uh in Romans chapter 8 verse
[3:03:51] 19 speaks about the manifestations of
[3:03:54] the sons of
[3:03:57] God now the revelation of the seven
[3:04:01] SE
[3:04:03] shows the manifestations of the sons of
[3:04:07] God and then that is the
[3:04:11] consolation we we don't have to
[3:04:15] worry home is sweet home we are going
[3:04:17] home all of
[3:04:20] us if if he
[3:04:24] terries of which we know right now the
[3:04:27] time and the signs are
[3:04:31] telling everything is
[3:04:35] telling and the word also is
[3:04:37] telling there's nothing Beyond
[3:04:41] this there's nothing Beyond this
[3:04:45] ministry we cannot say awaiting another
[3:04:50] Revelation there's no other Revelation
[3:04:52] the Revelation is that of the seventh
[3:04:56] SE beyond that is a
[3:04:59] Rapture God bless you God bless
