Description:
Title: Turn On The Light
Preached by Pastor Edgar Kuchinkale at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 28 July 2024

Genesis 1:1-2 & 3 | Genesis 2: 5 & 19-20 | Exodus 3:8 

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about Turning on the light.

Light is God spoken word. What made the light was God Spoken Word. We vindicate the Word of God by making it known to the people.

Light is a separator. When Light comes, all creatures of darkness runs away.

Darkness represents denominations. The Spirit of God moved upon the waters ( which is the people) and darkness was upon the face of the deep. The Spirit of God can move where there is darkness.

Apostle Peter was a bishop during his time but Paul was the light of that age.
The prophet said Polycarp couldn't be the light of the age because he allowed darkness to remain in the church. So the light of the age was Irenaeus.

Poverty can be spiritual and physical. When people are in poverty they walk undressed. 

We are the ambassadors of heaven and therefore we cannot run short because we belong to a different economy. We cannot be beggars because we are kings.

You shine the best as a star when there's too much darkness.

Your natural birth is too mysterious than your spiritual birth. 

As kings and priest we are interceding and not accusing. We need to petition for one another.

The pastor also the following spoken words:

63-1229M There is a man here that can turn on the light.  Par 58-63 & 68
64-0125 Turn on the light. Par 18, 20, 35, 51 & 5
64-0119 Shalom Par 171 & 176
60-0515E Adoption Par 7-8
63-0118 Spirit of Truth  Par 91 - 93

cannot turn on the light which you don't have you need to have the light so if I'm saying turning on the light I'm not turning about the light somewhere else that light is within you amen amen hallelujah amen so we start again amen amen uh Genesis 1 verse one and two and in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters ah harest that is exactly the mistake which we make gen 1 and two cannot be read like that gen 1 one is something which happened long ago amen amen uh get seated um just get used to me um I'm now getting old but I got not too many places to go when I come to church I don't have any I don't have any programs when I come to church program when I come here actually I come to stay so I always ask the church that if you are tired or you got another program even if I'm preaching you can leave and continue your program for me I am here to stay there are two or three people who are unlucky like me here I know The Interpreter is one of them when Monday comes you start learning and I don't know you know I can go 300 km and come back Monday so the devil wants me to leun again on Sunday I tell him no no no Sunday day break today evening ADV I not attend your wedding I canot attend your wedding want me to go to church run through the church no today we are going to settle down on the yeah let's start settling Harvest Harvest genesis1 verse1 it's a whole Bible that one verse is standing for everything which which happen there there hallelujah amen in the beginning in the beginning in the beginning there I don't know how many billions of years in the [Music] beginning but God created the heavens in the beginning period hallelujah amen when we are coming to two then we coming to our time now with with the beginning amen amen amen uh go to paragraph 58 my brother more verse 58 turn on the light H sorry paragraph 58 turn on the light yes are you there yes uh I want you to be no rushing uh turn on the right turn on the right paragraph uh 58 paragraph 58 yes so that was yeah there f is that 10 on the right um oh there are so many of them no no I want there is a man there is a man who can turn on the light there's a man who can turn on the light yes it's me who made me you wrong there is a man who can turn on the light amen there is a man who can turn on the light yes now uh the first light we find it in the Bible is found in Genesis one 1 ver3 amen amen amen amen let us all read it was God's spoken words so what's light you have to be answering me or we go up to four what is right God spoken words what you see outside there the sun is actually a result of God's spoken word it's not a light what made the light was [Music] God's God said let there be light and there was light amen now remember then light comes by and light is the Vindication or the subject of has spoke when light flies shows that God said amen amen amen amen amen amen so the light there it's a proof that God has [Music] spoken the light is a Vindication that God has spoken amen amen hallelujah amen God has spoken go down a little bit my brother go down down yes there now when you see his word being Vindicated what is being Vindicated made known or proved hallelujah amen how do we vindicate God's word when we make the word of God known to other people we are the people to make the word of God known to who is going to make the word of God known you it is your duty that's why you are here on Earth to make the word of God being known you are as important as the sun is amen amen go down my brother amen I'll go I'll come back to 61 but let me go to 62 first yeah 62 62 some of the people argue today in our schools and so forth about the world being made Millions trying to condemn the Bible and say it's wrong don't read the Bible That's so because the Bible doesn't tell us how old the world is God the Bible said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period when how that we don't know we don't know it now that's first that's period that's the end of the sentence that God created the heavens and the Earth how he did it we don't know hallelujah amen down a little bit my brother in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth it might have been million years how he did it that's up to him to know see not me can I stop there amen amen so in the beginning what happened there uh I don't want to know so whether it was a big bang it was what whatever is happening there for me I got a duty to do today because my part has been given to me so the Earth was without form and void that means there was a chaos amen amen amen amen amen amen and the spirit of God moved upon one one more thing I have to I have to teach this morning I I believe I already told this one my brother what is what is Darkness last time I said tell you what is Darkness yes my sister you said what is darkness no yes but what is Darkness for us as Believers no no no no no from today onwards I come back ask again darkness is [Music] denominations hallelujah amen so what is Darkness denominations okay after knowing that let's go back to Genesis 1 1 ver2 amen amen Genesis 1:2 yes and the Earth was without form and void yes and darkness was upon the face denominations were upon the face of the of the de yes that is yeah darkness is go and search in the message you find that darkness is denominational teachings and uh the dangerous thing is the next sentence and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters in that Darkness the spirit of God was moving you find people in the denomination they say hey the spirit of God was in me yes in Genesis the spirit of God is moving [Applause] am light is what the spoken [Music] word the spirit of God can move where the spoken is not there because according to Joel he says in the last days I will pour my spirit on all fresh what is fresh according to the scriptures according to the what US fresh no no no no no no what is fresh according to what brother us what is many people what is many people Waters what is many people beginning many people is water yes so water which is in darkness it's many people who are in which is denomination the spirit of God was moving many people who were in darkness all the way from Genesis without form void without [Music] order but the spirit was there one day there were 400 400 prophets they were inspired when one turns this way the all 400 turn this they turn that way and the head of put horns so they were 400 so another brother came Chief I have heard this 400 isn't there one he wanted them to be 400 [Music] soab no being a Jew he knew exactly what J meant he said yes my brother but I hate him if he comes here that'll be no good for me so the brother came his friends were warning him as they were coming you know brother uh here all your friends they have said good about the king when we take you from here and you go with us please just say good things it says okay I'll will say good things I say what I going to tell me so when he came to the church there uh he shouted uh good things the king says no you haven't said the way you always say say that say the Lord said oh now that say the Lord amen amen that's the difference then one of the the leading person on the group turn to him and hit him when did the spirit leave me you see why he was there he was moving like that the of can move where there's [Applause] Darkness so when God says let there be light he is moving Darkness to separate it from light amen amen and Children of the light go to the light of Darkness go to Darkness amen amen um hallelujah amen uh uh God bless you since we are called differently some of you might have houses have got a kitchen maybe this living room other side most likely a lot of all of you cook in the house so when uh there's darkness in your house there's a fellowship there amen there a fellowship so when you come put on the light you will find the Presbyterians learning under theti under the because light is a separator once light comes the creatures of Darkness cannot stand they can have fellowship with you when it's dark but when just come up with the light you find that light separates so in the beginning Genesis 13 13 brother uh what does it say my brother God said God said let there be yes the darkness was separated the speed was already moving amen so if you check on that if you come to the book of Acts if you come to Acts 2 you find that the speed came and they were speaking in tongues they he the sick was being healed dead were being lazed hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen how many of you who are Catholics here amen am Hallelujah we Catholics yeah let's yes my brother without any controversy who was the first Bishop of the church who was the first Bishop of this church Peter who did the keys who who has left with the keys that these are the keys to Heaven who Peter hallelujah amen Peter was there for some years the church the church was going on amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen who was the light of the day yeah that's where we are today we have to learn that one so who was the light of the day Peter was a bishop very Bishop but he did women col put on whatever they want to do the Jews run away from the Gentiles them he was P he himself wouldn't the Jews fearing the feeling so who came to correct that so who was the light of the day he came to separate the spirit was already moving the spirit was doing Miracles but they were able to leun away from Gentiles and blacks and they with am white [Music] but the spech is moving the word is moving so when Paul comes he come to tell them no no no no no no no the way you taking communion Darkness separate women keep quiet it doesn't matter whether you are the mother of Jesus or [Applause] you know people use relationships very hard keep quiet if you wife of Peter keep quiet who said that so who is the light of the day because he brought the light that's why you find in each and every chur you remember PO he was the the main Minister CH of actually irus was a student of Po the day which po was killed went to heaven those people who were believer that day saw his Spirit going to heaven as a dove and they head heaven singing welcoming po but when when the prophet comes says cannot be the light because he allowed Darkness to remain in the church so who was the light because so when it comes actually to come to [Music] Catholicism even if it was a small light you know the small Stars small small small Stars they shine a lot when it's dark that's why a small star like shine during the Catholic Times amen amen it's like you go to university of johbur you can SP sister from because this too dark there you know when it's dark people people put off cloths they walk without clothes in darkness so you shine the best as a star when there's so much Darkness brother Bram was talking about uh Mount superstitious M superstitious mountain turn on the 18 He said uh at this superstitious mountain people are talking about a lot about the superstitious mountain so one day brother went there and he took a torch so he was there with a torch so he says he had fears sorry he had [Music] fears he was there the whole night because they had told him that at superstitious mountain there evil spirits the Indians yeah yeah you know Mr President here sometime ago we sitting on on my first trip to Arizona to go hunting we out there is it 18 my brother that one 18 yes yeah we're sitting there near the superstitious mountain I had it a long time had many legend about Superstition I remember looking uh for it [Music] it was before day and the ghost shadow hang at the east of [Music] me which was known to be Superstition supers yeah Superstition Superstition I amen amen I hate about about the Indians how they wouldn't go near it they were afraid how the Spanish mistreated them when they were hunting for God they claim the evil spe lived in it all these my city but I only had a flashlight to see the and while I watched the Majesty of the sun began to move upon the [Music] darkness amen when it did it separated darkness and press in there so finally she ra her highness over the top of the mountain and it showed Superstition what it was it lit up show what it was all the Spooks and the fears that I heard of superstition when the sun sh in its power it it fled away what will make this what what what will make the Superstition to Lear this what will make [Music] the light what is the light the spoken word spoken the spoken word will make the all the superstitions to run away amen amen he says no matter how bright and artificial light can be when the sun shines it de it out amen amen paragraph 35 my brother yes sameone will just go paragraph 35 35 yes there okay and and it Mees the condition every time manifest his light the world itself rejects hallelujah amen hallelujah amen but each age each age God has alloted so much word for each age we have God alloted us each age he always send somebody to manifest that there is somebody here there's somebody side there's somebody the back who is going to Manifest this word amen amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen uh before I go away from this one go to paragraph 51 paragraph 51 amen he was speaking to good uh he was speaking to the uh this message was speaking he was speaking to Full Gospel businessman this message he was speaking to full amen amen um 51 says may I say this with leverence you were speaking to the businessman may I say this with L and respect but to bring hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what bringing light the prophet amen he was he was to bring light Unfortunately they never he that amen so there's always a man who can bring light amen Amen on paragraph five you can you can go back to paragraph five paragraph five he says yes I can yes go that sentence which I can only speak by inspiration yeah inspiration there no no he says it's up there yeah it's there it's up up up up I can only speak yes there yes I'm uneducated I only can speak by inspiration now that's good education when inspire two you can explain things could only speak by inspiration amen amen so the light your light has come rejoice and rejoice so uh the light is with who us you are the light because according to Genesis 1266 you were supposed to be an amate [Music] God and everything which was made on Earth was supposed to be under your rule hallelujah amen amen amen because Genesis if you can go to Genesis 2:5 my brother 25 you find that nothing grew for there was no man to the ground [Music] you hear you see that one my brother my sister amen the Lord God has uh every you can read my brother and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every h of the field before it grew for the Lord God has not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground look here God waited until the man was found for him to do something hallelujah amen so God waited for you my brother to do something in the location which you are in he did nothing in the location which you are in until you that location who are you the light so what happens in your kitchen when the light comes when the light comes it attracts creatures of the [Music] lights creatures of [Music] Darkness that's why when you are in there you find those of the light will come to you the other say no we are all all the same got the same mistakes well we have got the same [Music] mistakes no the light separates amen amen so God waited for you hallelujah amen if you go to Genesis 2 19 to 20 Genesis 2:9 to 20 when I'm

you are the real uh lungs of this [Music] church remain inside there hallelujah amen do you know how the Sun makes its [Music] light the sun is a big big planet but it would have been not been able to make light was not moving very very fast and turning upon because that Force creates a gravity towards the center of the Sun the center of the sun is so prized and it ignites to give up nuclear fusion hallelujah amen for those young people who are studying physics or you have already you see that's the way they make a nuclear bomb they fire from different places toward the plutonium the plum core becomes so compressed from there then BL so you cannot give out light unless you squeeze yourself squeeze yourself squeeze yourself squeeze squeeze move on brother move on that's when you bur out [Applause] and you don't give out light while sitting comfortably the sun is moving at a very high stage about 1 1 million km 1 million km per second the center of the gy at the same time that's the way it gives outl so if you see a big star which can become a supernova which is a very bright [Music] thing how does it become a Supernova by squeezing so much so much so much until the M of the Earth can can fit in a tennis ball when it does that when bur become how are we going to give ourselves light it's not about it's not about expanding ourselves it's about squeezing ourselves making
