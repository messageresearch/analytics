preached from the constellations standing up together we stand to for the reading of the word and we believe I'm going to be brief not knowing uh what is in his mind on brother do you have the scripture and we look at that scripture and that's less power hits our heavenly father we come today how wonderful it is to be amongst the Saints the people who were there before the foundation of the world and father they came through the Supernatural series and even this morning they I hear a lord God I have known you before the foundation of the world and we are glad that even this morning there is something that the Lord has been keeping for us for this morning you are you specialize every time lord we come we know there's something from God coming to us Lord God we are not politicians we are Sons and Daughters of God coming here to hear from you Lord God not from any man and we believe that the father your church was in you before the foundation of the world as a wife you have chosen to marry as father we are looking forward to that great day of the marriage of the lamb and they were so glad this morning Father all around the world all the saints the father who were there are even this morning looking forward to hear from them I pray father as we open the book that you will preach to us whatever is in your heart in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen brother you have a scripture for us Genesis chapter 19. from verse 27 and 28. and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plane and beheld and low the smoke of the country went up as a smoke of a furnace foreign oh man so you may be seated okay I'm in well Abraham Abraham early in the morning me so you got up I told her and went to the place where he stood before the Lord all right amen if we were to rewind and stand where we stood with the Lord [Music] even before feeling the foundation of the world because the Bible says as he has chosen us guy in him come here hey that's something wonderful it reminds me of this part that we we have read um what God does foreign I won't mention what the brother has read out morning that there won't be a service here today if they were supposed to be a human service if they were supposed to be that hello what you have read for us this morning would have been would have been I can't hear you it would have been possible if it was a Human Service okay yes the things that you have already there won't be a service today amen amen you know Lucifer that's why Lucifer Satan even from before foreign it will end up it says in the book of sales the better in this all better that started way back and and then and it says Satan and his angels and then they come to the Earth set in again because if broke all right let me step there but this old battles started way back Beyond Time amen amen but I want you to know that um before it's it started after it come around we existed or we are existing and he is our existence foreign [Music] [Music] the death of our bodies is that right ah man after last weekend [Applause] before last weekend so we thank God now I I want to go to something before we go to our scripture the battle that started way back Beyond Time and and Satan and his angels I kicked out but I'm going back to this the battle started Beyond Time and we will end yeah the reason why the people don't understand like the battle of Armageddon basketball it is because the people who were involved will be involved at the end because that battle that started will end up in the form of the battle of America [Music] will come back to those things because it tells me that all those beings if [Music] hey you were in heaven and you fought against Satan you have won the battle even this money you are winning you are we are not a newcomer what happened is now happening surgery all right before I go back to our scripture the battle that started way back uh Satan and his angels He is now you remember the prophet saying those the Angels there foreign demons they were responsible for the Jews of the death of the Jews because those demons they were responsible as they fought us [Music] and they killed the Jews the demons amen amen now it's going to happen again those demons will be seen again [Applause] I have just a short short something here [Music] because now we are facing the what the prophet spoke of here Arena the Christ he says or Christ there was three and a half years of Christ prophecy for three and a half years it is okay amen and I don't know if it is in this one because yeah I've got page 140 it speaks of Satan three and a half years Jesus prophesied for three and a half years foreign [Music] the reason we read this scripture here this morning is that Abraham appeared just before that tribulation and now we are appearing here before the tribulation amen amen now we must look at Abraham at that time when the tribulation was supposed to take place in those days of Abraham stood before the Lord okay now that was now we have here three and a half years We Are The World Is entering [Music] the three and a half years we'll come to that because that is the Tribulation Satan will be given power as the Bible says amen amen and he becomes for three and a half years you will be reminded we are going to bring them and read them and going as far as back to the Battle of America now [Music] um foreign and brother in my book here it is one page seven page 147. 147 five more a paragraph two to five but it seems it is not in this one because this one is another version okay all right I mean anyhow let me just quote to you and I could yeah now we are just some few days if you don't know hello I see you are preparing for future but you are just a few days from the tribulation period yeah now that's the time when Abraham after camera there were a few days away from that tribulation Abraham stood before the Lord that's why God said I hide from Abraham um and I'm so glad this morning we won't be we will not be taken by surprise foreign now the Seed of Abraham foreign you know if you plant your seeds yeah the seed uh a seed possessed some great I would say a great mind Hollywood yeah because in the process if it is planted it comes out through the process but the sit already before you plant it it knows that it has to come through this yes until it arrives back to the seed again if you go to your field you see on the in the field there is the seed of wheat planted then you will know that this seed is coming up there's a great minds yeah it is already in their minds fella but it as it starts to geminine it is the life that is in that City amen you just you you just watered all you can do but the law of growth just like we planted the seeds but the law of Life the law of growth you should be like Jesus you know that is the law of growth wow it is if it is not in you a preacher will work want help if the law is not in the witch will do everything sweaters because the life yes the life should be in the seat all that the farmer can do you know God just give you the holy ghosts was there in Genesis amen [Applause] brother have you if you go to the farmers are you a farmer now um do you go to your field every day um foreign okay it makes it easy things will be will go easier he sends the holy ghosts and the seed will start yeah and the seed has the Lord you don't give it the law every day okay oh man you are dead now I'm going to finish up quickly here where we are now who what is left now is the Tribulation period how many knows the same business all right I mean yeah God bless you all right now listen um do you know that the world now is facing the tribulation now where are you going what's the future you're talking about the future which one um because coward the river Euphrates it's dry EOP right now but we'll we'll come back to that this morning I just want to look at this for a few minutes the tribulation wouldn't come without Abraham being amen standing before God that's right [Music] God would never let anything happen without Abraham knowing today it is the Seed of Abraham that's why I read description that morning Abraham came Abraham read it again Abraham God and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord amen amen to the place Abraham knew that Abraham as he looked into his Supernatural calendars he knew that the only way for me to go forward is to Come Back To Where I Stood before and the bride of Christ or things can be seen from where she stood yeah as the Bible says yes you as I have chosen you before not after the foundation foreign it is a world without God you know what is tribulation that is that is just around the corners and maybe you don't know but Ibrahim knew the destruction of that word now surely we are watching we are seeing the signs every day I was with the brothers and then we were looking at things and uh seeing that now this is the time and so we were looking at things that were not they never happened before but it was only that time decided to come back to the place where he stood amen and dwelling the thing is you cannot see these things all right now you will not be foreign let me just uh read something there is a tribulation after the Rapture let's hear the Lord speaking both to those that are already Beyond those left behind us Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 12. now I want you to listen to something here he it introduced to two things uh as he reads it is telling us about those that are Beyond already and those that are left all right amen Revelation chapter 12 from verse 10 to 12. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the weight of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice in Heavens and neither dwell in them who to the Inhibitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because you knoweth that he has but a short time amen amen now listen I'm gonna chill each other you know even this morning the brothers were telling us about something in the office here that day the demons for whatever we were not supposed to to be in the services there won't be any services amen amen but while uh they were saying that while they were reading that to us we were we have already residual enough prepared for this service [Applause] trying to take advantage of last weekend advantage um I mean because somebody said maybe the pastor is dead and you are trying to hide it is I'll tell you something when there were some this woodlums this thought is in my house and they were sent um when they were doing what they were doing I kept on saying God has never told me that I will go this way amen amen and I knew that it is not from God so it won't work so [Applause] and there's something you it will be hard for you to believe with those strips you know caddy cable ties how they just snapped like you know [Music] um [Applause] [Music] all right I mean and foreign but I relaxed because I will go this way all right amen now Julie babies perfectly as Daniel said that she is and would be cut off in the midst of the week and Jesus prophesied three and a half of this week of this uh three and a half yes in the middle of it now the last part is the Tribulation this is great he says [Music] then after that we will come to the Millennium because there's a marriage of which we have to look at the marriage [Music] I'm looking at this the last we were looking at these things [Music] I'm looking for my papers it's a great mystery oh all right let me put it back together again amen all right now before we close Satan was cursed out according to the Book of Revelation let me go back again where did you read verse 12 verse 12. yeah let's come back I'm looking at it here verse 12 and what happened would you railing therefore Rejoice see Heavens any that dwell in them woe to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great breath because he knoweth that he had but a short time okay amen the devil knows of this coming short time do you know now we know whatever because you should know better than him if the devil knows something I know the bride should know better the devil knows about his short time yeah okay amen and what happens issue maybe start again Revelation chapter 10 chapter foreign and I heard a loud voice saying in heavenly now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night foreign and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the Dead therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea oh the devil is come down unto you amen right amen I want it I want just to foreign rejoice but will come with it the prophet puts it he told me that when I read um [Music] he is referring to the people Kappa that are here but at that time we have been raptured now the only person who will hear that the person who's going in there [Music] because predestination puts these things in you they actually happening to those who are abduced after the Rapture and those who remain foreign that's the difference the only person who is going to hear this is the person who's going in there because as I said it is like a scene we are going in the Rapture it's not just a preacher I didn't know what it is that life that is going in there but that is growing in there the people that are going in there you know it right now because the prophet says whoa amen it's not just the Rapture is but the Rapture is already if it is coming then it is you're reading the Bible that's right oh amen it is like you open the Bible for the seat the law of growth then comes this you take Roots um Yahoo England he didn't need to go to England that subject it's in the flowers [Applause] it is [Music] not every seed bring forth I mean it is like you see they say uh teach them then I say that's why we are not under that law I mean the law used to kill them and the Lord came and said I will now put the law in them [Applause] the law could not help them because it was thousands I'm going to put the Lord so it is the Lord that will operate not away from a preacher but the planted laws to be planted haha that is in you because God don't change now if he gave birth to you that you are like your father [Applause] amen amen already you were born with that Lord the lord gave birth that law of life now the law of life is in the wheat itself [Music] the Seven Seals that's why you come against and this one is not revealed that one is that one is on the board foreign not by teaching you all right oh man we are done and and that will close Okay amen amen you say ore I type maybe to uh the witch don't do not be which after that and you even say um he tells me that I will show him what I'm made of it means he's telling me that I'm sure or produce what is inside amen amen [Music] now I will show him I'm going to be with him you understand we are going to hell he is not here no I because it's like when you say more down to a lion and pray and pray to say to a lion foreign it will say amen amen amen amen amen I hear you yeah what I've done I'm with you just now going after that anymore because that thing is I can preach about I can talk about people who are

sticking out of the pastor's Pockets well the pasta was saying yeah you see my my son the Lord is coming this morning until the boy was busy [Music] but he is looking at them [Music] the dollars in the pockets there's two types of listeners if I I can say to you I understand this morning does their uh what do you call this sir like not like I mean heists [Music] and those same or whatever they just spread them some notes everywhere okay amen even after Services where is the place [Music] not that he wants to help now he wants to go there thinking that maybe there's still something you see so you preach You Preach Hypes amen now I was saying you can say you are a witch are you referring to me you are saying I'm a witch I'll show you I will show you I will show you that I am a witch okay it's a thing like that then you end up saying a witch is a witch I'm closing now now I'm going back to this for a few minutes [Music] so God told him about sodomo um now let's go to description Abraham Abraham early in the morning brother that's Genesis 19 19. verse 27 . let me look in my Bible here in Abraham got up early in the foreign you know that's why you'll see that the bride had to go back as he was chosen before I'm closing before the foundation of the world there was something I was reading here I want you to watch it as we are looking at this because I'm talking to you because the tribulation it's just here more house amen amen I'm looking for my picture going back to where you know yeah yeah let me read this and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place now if you read again and Genesis 15. you know the Bible said to Abraham after Lord separated then things became better for Abra yeah separation yeah sometimes is for a good purpose read it brother but let's listen here my few minutes Abraham Genesis chapter 13 from verse 14 yes and the Lord said unto Abram after that Lord was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place right wait a bit here and he said now and look from the place where thou art Northwest and Southward and Eastward and Westward foreign for all the land which thou see us today will I give it and to thy seed

mean now he said look from look from look from their place [Music] I mean Abraham came to their place he says look from there please how God dealt with Abraham and tell the stars [Music] and because the Seed of Abraham says the Stars the knowledge representatives [Music] from there now you say look up there shall be like that when you see the stars amen will be like the stars if you sick and you see those Stars you see the brightness it says foreign God created heaven and earth all right amen then when the people are shouting hallelujah amen then it comes again everything that was created

which Pastor is that the one inside well the one inside we'll talk about it by finish cabbage Abraham Abraham after Lord separated not not after Abraham separated meaning it is with the Lord understand it now yeah Lord Lord separated [Music] with god with God that's why after he loves separated Abraham let's talk business you know you know the goodness of separation all things work together for good okay all right amen but when I'm talking about separation I'm talking about the people who are separated from the Lord all right amen but listen get a challenge after God then God when Lord separated God got closer to Abraham like Hosanna you know sometimes some people a person would come to you toxic reasons why he finds you with somebody he will also talking like foreign thank you it's not for Lord I see a lot is for Abraham here Abraham now after you know the people come but they find you talking to somebody so they will be waiting for separation he wants to talk to you but because you are you are with somebody he will also be yeah on trial waiting for separation [Music] um if some we are with somebody who says the seventh seal is not revealed again after this one has left then God continues with you we're talking about the continuity is there any continuity there are some people here they are known to be destined and there's no continues you don't expect that person that's what he is now this Mysteries foreign you know preaching is like come come on come to Jesus because God has got no beginning all right come either come to Jesus but are the people coming yeah if the people really well came to Jesus every person to whom the gospel was preached come to Jesus would be in Jesus but you you go around you find the people question about Whom The Gospel was preached come to Jesus they were baptized and some of them well you don't find them in Jesus we understand that means then we must go back to predestinians all other things but we are the
