[Music] he for [Music] amen amen hallelujah and just forgive um I will ask all the pastor has already prayed Brothers will will you read the scriptures that I have given to you I've given them I think two scriptures okay maybe they don't remember okay we have read the scripture now let us read Ephesians 1 verse4 we are looking at the the ministry that started Beyond Time Ephesians 1 ver4 according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love heav predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins Accord to The Riches of his grace amen God bless you shall we read the second scripture eastic 3:4 to 15 15 ecclesiastic chapter 3 vers 14 to 15 15 if somebody can find that scripture 3:4 to 15 I know that what soever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it sir nor anything taken from it and God doth it that men should fear before him that which been is now and that which is to be has already been and God requireth that which is past uh I have the book the unveiling of God unveiling of God brother can you help me here [Music] [Music] Brother s this but amen from the book theing of God paragraph 279 it says it is all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was amen amen the revelation of what that was church the revelation of amen okay amen you may be seated I won't be long and we are sorry that uh something kept us now we are looking forward to the [Music] ministry the second you know we have a what do you call when the Lord the Lord Jesus he left one Ministry to another [Music] Ministry and they call they call this ministry the ministry of angels am amen uh we have the first one of the seven Messengers then the second one there's seven angels it blessed me when it said it's the second commission but it is of the Angels and these angels the prophet says they came from The Eternity yes there is EAS West the Garden of Eden was placed I don't know if we can read that scripture because there's also the ministry brother BR brother came he says let me read it rather but it's not what I'm going to talk about amen amen all right let's leave it for tomorrow if there will be any tomorrow now he speaks here of this uh the seven SE open up the revelation of what that [Music] was amen amen so that's the ministry Beyond Time amen then there's another part here it says the battle that means the Battle of amag he says it started Beyond Time amen the things that are revealed to us [Music] today to us it's not new things amen now Beyond time that's when we were in him [Music] and that was beyond time amen amen amen this ministry started there okay amen Ephesians says read it again brother I I won't be long is just to put this things in their place Ephesians 1:4 according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world okay yeah just keep standing according as he has chosen us before before there was any foundation [Music] we were we didn't start there but we were chosen before the foundation of the world the lord wanted us to see everything he was he was going to do so that we would not come as newcomers amen we started back there not actually there's no starting point for the Bride of what do we know he was in him before the foundation [Music] before there was any material we were already there amen so when he started to bring in the material things we have already existed in him [Music] remember we don't have any starting point it says we were in him no starting point and [Music] you amen amen now he says to Philip before was it Nathaniel amen before Nathaniel say it what happened called you saw [Music] [Applause] you like all of us here before even we are talking about coming to the message before that he has seen [Applause] us amen amen so that's why we can't go [Applause] back there's no return path for us okay amen now is the ministry that started Beyond time I just quote some uh there's another one here I have read where it says the battle started Beyond [Music] time that se amen 3:30 amen and this battle like the Battle of amag it's coming but the the people who will get engaged in that battle that will not be the first time because says the battle that started Beyond Time meaning it shall be finished now Beyond time is back there and Beyond time is a coming there's Beyond Time there and Beyond Time that will end the time so from Beyond time to beond now you are chosen and from Beyond Time and to Beyond Time amen I'm looking at the P here there's a purpose of God Beyond time that will run to Beyond time now do you understand I'm talking about Beyond Time before there was time to Beyond Time okay amen that's the ministry that amen we are blessed with amen then he speaks of the threefold which we will see amen amen I looking at this the seventh seal the seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis it's not a new SE it is spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis it's in the spoken word spoken Redemption is the day the book of redemption was revealed that's why brother says you were redeemed now to redeem is to amen amen now he speaks about this book of redemption he says Redemption is the day the book was opened the book of redemption [Applause] now he says Redemption day is the day the book of redemption was open he says that is the Redemption day you know to redeem the prophet has taught us much about what what to redeem to be redeemed to take something say it yes Amen in English to bring back to its origin that's what you call Redemption am okay amen now that's why he said Redemption is the day the book was opened which book the book of redemption brother says Redemption is the day the book of redemption was open amen amen amen now I'm looking at this we were one day talking about the coming Battle of [Music] amagon although it is like it confused the people when I asked who is fighting who but brother Bram says he speaks of the White House and another horse a Pale Horse the battle is between the right the white horse rider [Applause] Tau me about that that's why they call the ble of it is coming amen amen all right now I read here that's why he says the battle started in heaven 34 I'm trying to bring the things that have already started and the people don't know about the seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning you see we are not new in the seven I could Brothers 534 the seventh seal is spoken of from which year he spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis before we receive the opening of the seals the prophet says this seven seventh SE is spoken of from the very beginning of Genesis amen okay amen I I I don't want to read but we'll see tomorrow will be uh God has shown us these things which of the first I mentioned it the first commission right now we are under another [Music] commission you know why the people say the seventh seal is not revealed it is because it is in the pyramid now you will see when we open that book that the new commission is of the angels in the pyramid that's why even the seventh seal there's this seven angel with the seventh SE am why the people can't see the seventh seal it is because it is in the pyramid pyramid pyramid is the new commission [Applause] commission that's right amen we'll read it don't worry the new Commission Now the people that are struggling to understand what is the seventh they are struggling because they are without the because even the white stone brother Bram said brother said it is in the pyramid so the the the bride of Christ is in under the new commission not the seven se but the seven seven angels we we'll come to that the Lord willing now I was reading where he says the white stone we will read it the white stone is in theid now the pyramid is not the church ages amen can you see that there seven Church ages but we will see that the bride now is under the new Comm and that is the commission of angels that's why theeven seal brother BR speaks of the angel with the seventh SE with all right amen we look at that we are not in the church ages the bride is beyond the [Applause] church that's why people that are in the church AG they have been left [Applause] behind because once now it is in the pyramid what remains is a denomination right let us read all the way from Genesis this seventh SE is spoken of not from 19 no all the way from Genesis the seventh seal was there now if the seventh seal was there the bride was there so you go back amen you will find that the bride of Christ was beg there amen absolutely now here let let me I'm tempted to read again amen all the way back from Genesis this seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning Genesis only it was open okay Jesus Christ j is speaking himself told of the end time and told of the six seals when he got to the seventh he stopped let let's read something here uh we see every time how God stopped at something uh where's my books [Music] there's another book I miss here uh brother who this brother uh no no don't open there it must be somewhere

this um all the way I quote 483 in this cies all the way the book is either you left it in the car amen yes because I can't see it here amen all the way am I preaching or talking we are still talking weach I don't mean tonight all the way back from Genesis the seventh seal it's spoken of from the very beginning of Genesis amen you are you looking at that we say all the way back from Genesis this seventh seal is spoken of it's not a new thing now all the people the bride of Christ people who were there back there they came already with the seventh [Applause] SE the seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis the seventh SE amen that's why when he got to the seventh he stopped that is Revelation chapter 7 what do we see there Revelation chapter seven I I believe the brother will bring the book either they left it in the car more Revelation 8 verse1 uh Revelation the book of the the Bible the Bible chapter 7 talking about silence and and when he had opened the seven seal God bless you Pastor there was silence in heaven about the space of and hour amen silent in heaven amen because Brothers the we came with that book I think either they left it in the car okay they will bring it because I wanted not just to talk all right amen because here we have the ministry that started Beyond time that's just Ministry and I think I'm here with the people who were there Beyond [Applause] Time and Ministry is not a 1963 Ministry no before there was [Music] 19633 they were already there amen amen Beyond time you know beyond time we were not in the like this we were not in this type of things that was beyond time now the bride will reside from Beyond time to Beyond [Applause] time because when you come next time and I'm beyond time you won't find me in this material amen amen so right now I was looking the people that are saying the seventh seal is not revealed it is because it is in the pyramid and the bread of Christ is now in the pyramid now we will come and talk about the pyramid it is amen amen everything the bride Christ we will look at the pyramid that even the white stone brother B says is now in the pyramid amen all right amen the ministry uh who was that woman the Lord Jesus spoke to her and brother Bram says when the Lord Jesus spoke to the woman uh when brother Bram spoke to that woman about squirrels sister and she said brother that's nothing but the truth and you know brother Bram says she didn't hear it from here when he spoke to her and she said said brother nothing but the truth and brother Bram says it is not she didn't hear it from here God spoke out of her heart do you remember when those men some body will C they said we didn't hear I I I'll look for it now they heard the Lord Jesus speaking but not from here [Music] the the ministry of the seventh seal is note from here you can hear it anywhere in the world the seventh seal you don't hear it from here no one can even teach you that do you remember yes when they said we have heard him ourselves who are they the of Samaran woman Samaritan men are this men who said we didn't yes amen but the one I'm talking about they said we didn't hear him I'll I'll find it okay amen oh I'm I'm I'm there amen we have had him [Music] ourselves that's what it should be like with you after service it should be we have heard him ourselves are we going to say that we'll pick him up we'll pick him up we will hear his voice in The Pyramid I'm not talking about that pyramid I'm talking about the pyramid that brother BR T me where there was seven angels because after the church ages the ministry changed and was put now in the pyramid I will read it if you don't know what the pyramid is okay amen and that's why he calls it the second commission the first commission it is M seven Messengers Messengers that's the first commission but the second is Angels it is the commission of the Angels now you will realize that brother bam is dealing with the [Music] angels but we look at it and that's why even today the people that are left behind with the quotations they haven't yet arrived because it has to change to the second commission the first commission is on the disciples the apostles but the second is of the Angels even the the brother B speaks of an angel with the seventh SE showing that only the people that are found to be in the second commission these are the people who have received the who they know about the seventh [Music] SE because it is an angel that came with the seventh SE that's why brother speaking of flying [Music] interpretation amen not for everybody did you hear him speaking about the flying interpretation flying is speaking of as an angel that the seven SE is so special he received it from an angel now he calls it the flying interpretation he brother sister the FL [Applause] interpretation amen that's what brother and we that the s that came flying hey what great mystery uh I don't know the brothers we had a book with us I don't know what happened to my uh either it's in the car not in the car I don't know in the back or what but we had we came with the book find in the check in the in my back I don't know what happened but we had it in the car amen all right amen or let me just quote even if brother uh the title I am still I'm I'm myself I'm searching for the title but let me quote to you something brother Brenham speaks about the seventh brother Brenham speaks about the seventh I just wonder why we had the book and let me check first before let me not surrender all right anyhow we talking about something here in that book it speaks of the seven where brother Bram when he arrived at the seventh he [Music] what they saying that is in the book he stopped at the seven because it says God stopped there because that is Revelation chapter 7 the seven he stopped at the seven now there's a reason why he because in that that book it says because he arrived at his own image that's why we have the seventh angel messenger it can't be the sixth seven now the Revelation says when he opened the servant he stopped there now in that book it says why he stopped it is because he arrived at his own image now we have the seventh messenger when he arrived at the seventh when he open the what how how does he put it in the in the book Revelation I mean the the S book even in Genesis it says let us make men in our image so that book I I wonder what happened to that but when he arrived at the S he stopped now the book says because he arrived at his own image that's why we have the seventh angel messenger you cannot receive the revelation of God from any other person but it should be the seven amen that's what is written in that book is two books that got when now looking today we are so blessed the seventh seal now the seventh seal not just as a quotation you have not received a quotation you have received the seventh seal where is it from brother [Applause] oh are you sure it's from the library okay amen God page 10 God wanted to make a man after his image God don't want something different from who he is am that's why he said let us make men in our image so the bride of Christ is in the image of let me read I'm closing God wanted to make a man after his meaning he looked at himself amen am and he was pleased about this image so that's why the first thing in his mind he wanted to make gods brother bam says in the book Blasphemous name he says the sons of God will be Gods because God is worshiped by the gods as he said let us make men in our image if we are if I am God let them be God God is worshiped by the god amen amen amen now I quote God wanted to make men after his image the great is it sculptor yes he went to work on him a Man In His Image he couldn't think of any other kind of creature if then he regards himself as God now in order to make men it should only be in His image not another kind of man not a giant not a what but let us make men in our image this is what he said and we are all seated here but we should be in the image [Applause] of that's right says the great sculptor he went to work on him and we notice as he brought up from the materials perhaps the fish then the beds he was he was coming to his image then the creeping things upon the Earth and many things that he brought but all this time he was coming to his To His Image none of the things before the image could worship him or could be like him that's why he started like that mind Was His [Applause] Image amen things couldn't be like him he was the sculptor of Eternal things let me come to this and the scor that could create and bring into existence that which he has in his mind let me finish he began to work upon the scripp things little animals but finally he brought it into larger animals such as the lion TIG bear amen you know you you read these things but I'm coming to this one but finally there Came Upon there came forth upon the earth a Perfection that's why he says be ye therefore perfect as I am perfect nothing imperfect can worship God right amen what is you know something that is imperfect the young people are are ruled by the cell phone every time when where they are cell phone that's what in in their mind all right amen and they come to church with cell phones ready to open in their [Music] pockets I've got cellone not even not one but I'm not ruled by a cell phone to phone you I will use my cell phone M but the young people they don't use it for that you check the pH photos in their cell pH young men say Amen you check their cell phones they are here with their cell phones with girls you know what else can a person with the cell phone and girls in the cell phone go in the rupture which Rapture can you be raptured with a cell phone full of girls young men young women you don't know God let me I'm not attacking I'm preaching now listen when God was thinking then he wanted a worshiper to be in his own image you know to be worshiped by his own image now that's why this book Masterpiece it says but finally they came forth upon the earth a Perfection that's why the seventh SE and that was a man and and then he could see in that man that it looked like [Applause] him he didn't look at the suit of the young man of that man but he looked where in because the real person is in if you see somebody smoking and worshiping cell phone you know that that's what is in all right amen somebody phed me and said it was not a phone call it was a type of communication he said how are you going to help us in the Rapture I said no I it is God who's going to Rapture us me I can just preach Rapture to you okay then he said but Satan says he is planning something for us because God has planned for us the Rapture Satan also has planned for his own people that liar and then he could see in that man that it looks like mean God has put a mirror in a man so that when he looks at that Mir he can see himself amen amen amen so that means in you inside of you there is a mirror when God wants to see himself he looks at you hallelujah praise God that's why he said let us make men in our image God don't use a mirror like we have this mirror it's your heart it's in you when he wants to see himself he looks at a brother and he can see himself inside that's why he said let us make men in our image the image he didn't mean that that person to look like a Zulu or was talking about the inside the inner man amen amen the Rapture is coming the Rapture is coming the socalled prophets in this world let me tell you something the Rapture is coming and those that are called prophets and so forth they can't even see that then they say no one knows when the rupture will take place they are right I can't give you that day the exact day no for the Bible says I am just waiting for the rapture but the Rapture is in [Applause] you amen amen you know sometimes you can't even sleep during the night you find yourself longing to see him why you are in His [Music] image and so for and sometimes not only when the people are singing even when you are alone there is that in a man singing oh I want to see I can't even sing sing singing a his face start [Music] it amen amen that's it amen if you have that it is because it is that man in your heart I I'm closing here and he could see in man that it looked like him what will he see when he looked in you but when he looked in that man it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of that of what his creator was you know he looked at Peter at C Philip and said who who do men say that I the son of man am now there at uh that place what did they say cilia Philippi because that place that's where they worship God sacrifices and there was one part which looks like a cave like and that one they they say is the gate to hell and there was some other places where they would worship their God amen amen now when he said to Peter seen it recently there he said who do men say I the son of men am they said well some say you know the and he said but who do you say and Peter said Thou Art the Christ son of the living and said Peter blood and flesh not revealed this to you but who has now I saw last time that where he asked this question they were standing before that H there that looked like um a cave and uh they call that place the Gate of Hell and the Lord said Peter said Thou Art Christ son of the Living God and the Lord said Peter Peter meaning little Stone flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but father what did the Lord say about the h I will the Gates of Hell shall never Prevail and before them there was that gate of and it's written there the Gate of all right amen and Peter meaning small rock and they were standing before that place where the Greeks the Romans they used to come there to worship their gods now in closing now he could see in that man that it looked like human so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator [Music] was how would you like to see the Lord Jesus was looking at you in the manner that he looked at Peter Peter meaning small rock amen amen Peter Thou Art and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall never Prevail hey it was not an apostle or a preacher who told Peter that you know I'm always longing to hear God saying something about me but then when we receive the message by the seventh angel messenger is then we willage to read about what God thinks about us amen the seventh angel messenger the message told us all things that message told me who I am it even tells you whether you are going in the Rapture or not because God don't just tell you something but he puts it in you your the coming rapture to you it's not on a piece of paper but he has put it in you that's why when you are walking you find tears running down and because you know there's a song in me always of how I will react when I shall see him face to face amen amen how many would want to see Jesus not just to hear about him but to see to behold his face is there something in you that wants to see him is it there while walking thinking that one day there will be [Applause] Rapture and you'll see him amen amen let me close with this then he could see what can God see in you in that man that it looked like him when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator [Applause] was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted Amen in his own image to God it it is an achievement to see a man in his own Revelation 7 says when he opened that it was seven the seventh messenger the seventh seal seven when he opened the seven seal so I you know a child of God can see what is in him or in you know sometimes we we spend a lot of time beholding His Image as we are closing I wonder who has that thing in his or her heart Amen to meet Jesus is there [Applause] somebody and can you sing that chorus oh I want sing it brother oh I want to see him look upon his face let to dwell Forever sing of hising GRA Amen in the streets of Glory let me lift my voice oh fast home at last ever [Music] to Hallelujah all brother

he around here be ready be let us just stand up ready when Jesus will you be ready sister [Music] Amen brother will you be ready amen amen then he could see in that man that it looked like him what about when he looks at you he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God has now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted hey that is God's achievement God's achievement amen amen when he could see in that man that it looked like him he looked upon him was a reflection that his creator was God had now been able to achieve a thing that he wanted a man in His [Applause] image to God that is an [Music] achievement are you in that position that when God looks at you he can Rejoice to see himself in you in the cross in the [Music] cross oh my [Music] sh [Music] rest the
