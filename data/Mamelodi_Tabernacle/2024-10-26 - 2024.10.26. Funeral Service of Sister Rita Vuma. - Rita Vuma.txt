Title: The Secret of Life After Death
Preached by Elder Dan Masethe at Soshanguvhe on 26-10-2024

Romans 8: 11 & 18-19 | I Corinthians 15: 35 & 40 | John 8: 51 | Luke 20: 37 - 38 | Matthew 16: 13 - 15 | 

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the secret of life after death.

This secret was not known until Jesus came and said I have the power to lay my life down and to raise it up again.

There was the Sadducee, the Pharisees and the scribes who were blinded and they were under the bondage of death.

There are people who are accounted worthy of the new world to come and of the resurrection from the dead. God is not God of the dead but of the living.  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are not dead but live in Him.

There are three stages of everything. The stage of the mortal body, the stage of an immortal body and the stage of a glorified body. When you depart you enter into your celestial body. That is the body we enter into while waiting for the resurrection day.

Your celestial body is the form and shape of this body. In the resurrection the spirit will be released from God and go into the sixth dimension to pick your soul and come to the earth to pick the substances you once lived in.

Old age is the sign that we were once chased out of the garden of Eden because of sin. 

When you receive the spirit of Him that raised Jesus from the dead, it is a confirmation of resurrection. Jesus did not need someone to come and raise him. If the spirit dwell in you, you don't need anyone to raise you up in the first resurrection. Jesus said my sheep hear my voice, when they are alive they hear his voice and when they are dead, they recognise his voice.

The quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition. With the celestial body you go to the place of rest, but in the resurrection you come with th...

scripture is First Corinthians chapter 15 I will read verse 35 and verse 40 but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come verse 40 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another Amen 15:14 Let Me [Music] may the Lord richly bless you you may take your [Applause] seats we had a wonderful time last night with our Elder comforting our hearts comforting the family comforting friends and comforting all the people that were close to our sister he was indeed inspired by the Holy Spirit to read the scriptures unto us so I'm just trying to follow on his footsteps I want to put a title to the message this morning I want to speak on the secret of life after death the secret of life after death this secret was not known until the Lord Jesus Christ came and he said I have the power to lay my life down and to rise it again there was never a man that was able to lay his life down and raise it again all this years death was an enemy but after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ death was no longer an enemy there was also an argument among the Pharisees and the Sadducees the sad did not believe in the resurrection cuz they were not aware of the secret of life after death and the Pharisees believed in the resurrection but they didn't believe the message of the Lord Jesus Christ so they were blinded both the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes they were all blinded and they were under the bondage of death until the Lord Jesus Christ came and he revealed the secret of life after death I want to read the scripture John chapter 8 while we are still here there was an argument between the Lord Jesus Christ and the Pharisees verse 51 says verse 51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my seeing he shall never see death that was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking says if a man he's talking about a moral B if a man keep my say you shall never see death that was the first time they heard a man saying those words if a man keep my say he shall never see death then said the Jews unto him now we know that thou has a Dev they were blinded they didn't know and they say even quoting the scriptures to the Lord Jesus Christ Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death cuz they were under the bondage of death our Elder yesterday said people feared death and they were under the bondage of death now here comes the Lord Jesus Christ say if you keep my sa you shall never see death now they looked at him and they said art thou greater than our Father Abraham and they repeat Abraham Abraham which is dead to them Abraham was dead to them the prophets were did then yet a man says if you keep my saying you shall never see death hallelujah amen amen I hope you don't fear death hallelujah amen amen amen it says here art thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead who maketh thou thy asking the Lord Jesus Christ who makest thou thyself and say if you keep my saying you shall never see that hallelujah amen then he answers them and I'm going to read Luke chap 20: 38 he says telling them now about Abraham about Isaac and about Jacob says now that I'll start from verse 37 from verse 37 uh maybe I should start from verse 35 amen but they we shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world you see the the Bible promise us about the future where when you read Revelation chapter 21 there is a promise that in the world to come there will be no more death hallelujah amen and he says and the resurrection from the dead for there are those that are counted worthy to obtain that world so that means the world that is to come is not for everyone but only those that are counted worthy we will look at it later who are these worthy ones that are accounted for the future world to come it is not everyone but there are those that are worthy for the future amen amen and the resurrection from the dead so there are those that are accounted worthy for the resurrection of the de it's not everyone you know uh when somebody pass away or when somebody depart there is a saying may his soul rest in peace rest it's easy to speak lies this thingsapp we will be posting that even on WhatsApp soul rest in peace we must be honest he didn't believe the word of God how can you rest in peace it's not worthy to be counted in the first resurrection unlike our sister here he is accounted worthy of the world to come he's accounted worthy of the first resurrection hallelujah amen so the Bible says there are those that are accounted with to obtain the world to come and the resurrection from the dead verse 36 verse 36 neither can they die anymore you know death is a separation from the loved ones you know the Lord Jesus Christ said to his disciples Lazarus is sleeping even the disciples were happy I love their respond they said Lord if Lazarus sleep he's doing well he will wake no problem so the Lord Jesus Christ noticed that they don't understand this language then he spoke plainly unto them Lazarus is so our our sister sleepeth you will do well he will awake hallelujah amen let me continue even Moses sh at the Bush when he call the Lord the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him you see to the Pharisees they said Abraham is dead and the prophets are dead they did not understand the secret of life after death but to the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says he is not God of the day because Abraham Isaac Jacob they are not de to you they live hallelujah amen they are not dead you see the are three stages we read the book of Corinthians it talks about the body terrestrial that is a mortal body then it talks about imortal body now that is a cal body that is the body that our Elder yesterday said when you depart from this Mortal body there's another body waiting hallelujah amen that is the body that we enter into on our journey to the six Dimension you see H they say a man is a a three-fold being we have this body we have the spirit and we have the soul now this is in a mortal body a body that die a body that gets sick but then there is so there's three stages of everything there a state of the Mortal body there's a state of an immortal body and there is a stage of the glorified body now when we talk about the secret of life after death we talk about the J when we depart from this place into another body that is only for the Christians then when you depart you go into an immortal body which is your Celestial body is a body that we go into while we are waiting for the Resurrection Day hallelujah amen now it says when this body dies the spirit goes back to the Lord that gave it and the Soul goes into the sixth dimension that is a a waiting place while you are in your Celestial body amen amen now it says I'm going to read this when the soul leaves the body it takes a journey into a place of rest in a body that's in the form and shape of this body so that means your Celestial body your Immortal body is in the form and shape of this body hallelujah amen but it is not this type of a body it is another B amen amen you will meet your loved ones hallelujah amen in that Celestial B those that are in the six Dimension when you depart from this place as a Christian now we we will talk about how to prepare this Mortal body so that the incorruptable can swallow the corruptable so that the the the immortal body can emerge out of this Mortal hallelujah amen now when you when your soul lives this body it takes a journey into a place of rest that is in the sixth dimension in a body that is in the form and shape of this body that body is called a Celestial body that's what our Elder was talking about last night amen amen now in the resurrection it says the spirit remember when you depart from this place the body goes to the Grave so we are taking the body of our sister to the Grave hallelujah amen now it says in the Resurrection the spirit will be released from God because when you die now as a Christian worthy of the future where worthy of the first resurrection the Bible says your spirit goes back to God hallelujah but if you are not worthy obviously goes to hell you know there's a testimony of our Elder he says never never never wish anyone to go that route to go to hell he says is my that is not a place of rest you don't even meet your loved everybody's just crying and it is it's like a bottomless p and it's so dark you can't see another person you just see others crying some have been crying for the last 2,000 years they are going to miss the Millennium they will just be crying it's so said amen amen now it says in the Resurrection The Lord Jesus Christ will release your spirit and it will go into the sixth Dimension to pick up your soul then it will come to the Earth to pick up the substance that you once lived in hallelujah amen our Elder said yesterday when you are in that Cal body you don't eat you are just waiting in a place of rest and there is no old age there so it says old age is is is a sign of of sin so old age is a sign that we were once out of the Garden of Eden because of sin but the prophet says when you enter the sixth Dimension you become at your youth you go back to your youth age you are not old there you know we read the scripture in the book of Corinthians it says and God gives them a body as it has pleased him you see if you please God while you are still alive when you depart God gives you a body because you have pleased him and you become young again a Celestial B so in the resurrection God will release your spirit it will go into the sixth Dimension pick up your soul and it comes to the Earth to pick up the substance that you once lived in hallelujah amen now when it picks up the substance that you once lived in now you are in a glorified B you see the secret of life after death you Journey from Mortal to Immortal to a glorified B Hallelujah am the Pharisee didn't know these things amen amen so your journey from being mortal to Immortal as you have pleased God God gives you a body which is a Celestial body you go into a resting [Music] place in the Resurrection the first resurrection then God gives you a glorified body hallelujah amen amen let us move on May the Lord richly bless you let us go back to Romans chapter 8 ver 11 can I borrow a watch amen amen now I said earlier on it is not all the Mortal bodies that will journey into a place of rest with an immortal body amen amen it's only those that were converted that received an abstract abstract which is their title de while they are still alive hallelujah amen so I want to talk about this Mortals Mortals I want to talk about those that are alive which the Bible says they are counted worthy for the first resurrection how can one be counted Worth to come in the first result while you are still alive you cannot be counted worthy after death but you must be counted with while you are still here while you are still alive hallelujah amen you know uh uh let's go back to Romans 8:1 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you hallelujah amen now we must find out the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead because that Spirit must dwell in you hallelujah amen and it says that spirit will Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you see you receive the weight that is very good you believe the weight but then you must be quickened and it is the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead that can Quicken your mortal so if you are not quickened then you are not a potential for the first resurrection amen amen it [Music] says now the word Quicken means to be made alive after death you know the Bible says we come to the world speaking Lies We Come To The World dead hallelujah amen but then these bodies must be quickened while we are still here on this amen amen so the word Quicken means to be made alive and it is only the spirit that can Quicken this body amen amen as we continue it says that when you receive that spirit is a confirmation of the Resurrection the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead when you receive it it is a confirmation of the Resurrection we call it a Pentecostal blessing Hallelujah amen so when you receive it the Bible says you receive the abstract the title deed hallelujah amen amen amen it's like you are surprised it is the scripture amen amen so it is the spirit that brings you to life when the Holy Spirit comes down into your heart it's a confirmation that you are for ordained of God hallelujah amen to be in the Rapture so it's a confirmation that you will come in the first resurrection amen amen when you receive that spirit it's a potential that you are already recog recognized by the Lord that you are worthy of the future world hallelujah amen amen amen it is a potential it is a quickening power of your Resurrection let's go back to the Book of Romans chapter 8 [Music] I want us to to read from verse 19 amen let's my brother just read from Verse 18 from Verse 18 yes for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so there's a glory that must be revealed in That Glory must be revealed while you are still here so there's a glory that is growing in you and that Glory must be revealed amen amen go on my brother for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God you know when the Lord Jesus Christ was here on the earth he said Greater Works shall you do says the works that I do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do you know there was a time that he was sleeping in the boat and Satan was trying to take advantage with a storm threatening the disciples and they woke the Lord Jesus Master we are dying here wake up and the Lord stop and the Lord Jesus Christ stopped to the storm and he said where's your faith meaning I'm not the one that must stop the storm when I made you in the beginning I made you to have dominion over the Earth exercise your godship exercise that you are an am God where is your faith why can you stop stop the storm hallelujah amen so he said the Glory this power must be revealed in you amen am I'm going to look at it where our Elder yesterday said this must come by Revelation and he quoted Matthew chapter 16 and it says this must also be revealed unto you hallelujah amen now let us read my brother it says for the earnest expectation of the Creator wait for the manifestations of the sons of God so there will come a time that the sons of God are manifested the glory is revealed in them when our Elder was praying he said there is an Uninvited Guest I'm sure you heard him there's an Uninvited Guest but his prayer was telling that Uninvited Guest that you have no power yet the sons of God are manifested they have that power to stop you hallelujah amen amen amen verse 20 my brother for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glory Liberty of the children of God continue for we know that the whole creation grown and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body you see when you talk about the secret of life after death he talks about a journey from Mortal to Immortal to a glorified body but it says even though we are groaning with the first fruit of our spirit we are waiting for the adoption hallelujah amen and when you receive the adoption it means you receive the Redemption of your so when the sons of God are adopted while they are still here their bodies are redeemed they are just waiting to show it hallelujah amen you know it says potentially the quickening power of your Resurrection is already in you when you receive the Holy Spirit when that spirit is dwelling in you it means you are growing to the full Resurrection one day the incorruptable shall swallow the corruptable and the and Paul says we shall be changed in the twinkling of an that's if that spirit dwells in you when you die it will raise you from the dead elishah received a double potion of the spirit that was in Elijah when Elijah died at an old age they buried him and the the body deteriorated into bones for hundreds and hundreds of years then one day a dead body was dropped but the power the quickening power was still in Elijah even though Elijah was in Paradise but the body itself the bones that were in the grave they still had that quickening power a man that dropped dead down there resurrected because of the power that was in Elijah hallelujah amen even when elishah was dead that quicking power was still there hallelujah amen amen so that's why it says if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you it will also raise you from the dead you see H the Lord Jesus Christ didn't need another person to come and raise him up you don't need another person to come in the first resurrection that power must be in you when you hear the voice of Resurrection you stand up because the power is in you you don't need somebody to give you power you see when Lazarus was dead what Lazarus heard was to recognize the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ when the Lord went to the graveyard when he went to the Tom he said Lazarus come forth with a loud voice and the Lazarus that came forth was the one that recognized the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he says my sheep hear my voice when they are alive they hear his voice when they are dead they recognize his voice hallelujah amen you know when when when is preaching I can hear my pastor speaking in him and that means I recognize the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may the Lord richly bless you let me move from this you are growing to the full Resurrection aren't you happy that you are growing to your full Resurrection amen amen you see that quickening power brings your body into a ruptured condition amen amen it brings your body into a ruptured condition amen amen I want us to to to go back to the book of Corinthians then after we will go back to the scripture in Matthew chapter uh 16 then I believe we will be closing it says but some man will say some how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come you see with the celestial body you go to a place of rest but in the resurrection you come in a glorified Bo God will release your spirit and it will go into the sixth Dimension into that place of rest it will pick up your soul and it will come down to the Earth and pick up the substance that you lived in that is this body and you will now be in a glorified [Music] body now when you are in a glorified body the beauty part is you can eat but when we in a Celestial body you don't eat when we are in this body you get sick you need a car to travel to go to limo you need a bus to go and see your beloved ones you travel through days and days to go to mamb you have to cross a border in this body but in a glorified body you don't need those things hallelujah amen you don't need those things even the walls cannot stop you you know when they were in the upper room with the doors locked making sure that nobody will come in and they just heard the Lord saying peace he didn't have to knock he didn't to say hey open the door he just walked in and said Peace be unto you you know the glorified the body that's what we long for amen amen now I want us to go to the Book of Matthew chapter 16 and I I want to close with that scripture may the Lord richly bless you my brother let us read from verse 13 Matthew 16 from verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philip he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am let's stop right there whom do men say that I the son of men you see the gospel is not about what the people say about him but it's about what you say he is he must be revealed to you you know the Bible says John recognized him when he came to the River Jordan to be baptized but for John to recognize him he was revealed by the Holy Spirit and John says I saw the Spirit like a dove coming to him and John recognized him and said this is the one so now the Lord brings that question to the disciples who do men say I the son of man am verse 14 and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he sath unto them but whom say ye that I you see he want to be recognized he want to be revealed unto you because you cannot say the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwelleth in me where as you have not even received the revelation of who he is you need to know who he is hallelujah amen if you don't know who who he is then you can't come up in the resurrection how will you recognize him how will you hear his voice Hallelujah so he wanted the disciples to say who he is read again my brother verse 15 he said unto them but whom say ye that I am continue and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God only Simon Peter responded I'm sure they were looking at one another say hey what are we going to say because we have told him what the people say but now this is directed to individuals then Peter received the greatest Revelation that he is the Christ the son of the Living God you know Christ means the anointing verse 17 my brother verse 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven so this revelation of who he is is revealed by the father himself hallelujah amen it is revealed by the father himself you know there was a time that the disciples asked and they said show us thy father you have been talking about your father show us thy father and he said the father is in me hallelujah amen and the pastor says when you see the word being revealed you have seen the father hallelujah amen I normally H H say a a joke you know Samuel heard the voice of God and and and El said you must respond they say speak my lord your servant is listening so H we always had that kind of an expectation that we want to hear the voice of God speaking to us until when your parents call you from the kitchen say when they call you you just say speak my lord your servant is listening because it's not the voice coming from outside it comes from the inside and you will recognize amen amen now Peter received that Revelation and the Lord Jesus Christ said blessed are thou he see for receiving that Revelation you are blessed amen amen Verse 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it when you receive that Revelation it says the gates of hell will not Prevail against you you see that is the prevention we need protection the revelation of who he is when you receive that Revelation it says the gates of H will not Prevail against just to receive the revelation of who he is hallelujah amen the last verse 20 then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ you see that Revelation it's not something that somebody can tell you that he is Jesus the Christ it is something that comes by Revelation amen amen now let me go to this you know H the Bible says You must be born again it says You must be born again and I want to read this to you you see a new body comes from this born again you see the body that must swallow this corruptable body it comes from this Born Again from this new birth hallelujah amen the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you as it happened to Peter so it says when you receive that Revelation you also receive a new body so a new body comes from this new birth without that new birth you don't have a new body because the Bible says the in corruptable will swallow the corruptable so is the new body that you receive from this new birth that will swallow the corruptable when you receive the new birth which is the revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth is Christ hallelujah amen the inside of you down in here inside that is a person that cannot die and that's the person that the New Life Starts from when the Bible says You must be born again it says You must be born of water and the spirit that's why the Lord Jesus Christ said you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you are baptized any other way you are far from the kingdom baptism must be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen now when you receive the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know it says God will give you a new heart and a new spirit that means you'll have a new desire for the way you receive a new board when you receive the revelation of who Jesus Christ is then a body start to develop inside of you and he says that that is a new body a new life that starts from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person that you are so when you receive this new birth we see you but inside of you there's a new body that is growing and one day that body will swallow the corruptable let me read the last thing here H you see I'm closing I just want to read this to you about this mysterious new body that [Music] develops cuz that is the glory that will be revealed in you now it says Romans 8:1 the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if that spirit dwelleth in you it will raise you from the dead so now the people that have this Spirit the Bible says they associate with the Unseen World and the supernatural you know was preaching in m and he quoted where the pastor says I have seen that New Jerusalem and says God will never allow you to preach about something that you didn't see hallelujah amen so when he talks about the New Jerusalem you have seen it when he preach about Millennial when he talks about the sixth Dimension hallelujah amen so when you receive the spirit that dwell that raised Jesus from the dead while you are here you start to associate with the Unseen you start to associate with the [Music] supernatural hallelujah amen no wonder people can't believe these things because you associate with Angelic beings with the supernatural it says when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly you become a twofold being you become a two-fold being you are still subject to Earth in this body you are subject to death but in your soul you have passed from Death unto life hallelujah amen and the body is subject to death but at the same time one of you you are heaven and you live there while you are still here no wonder you cannot de associate us with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen in this body you are still subject to death remember death is just a separation from the loved ones the Bible speaks of the first death and the second death so the second death is when you die in your soul that means you are totally separated from God but when you depart from here you are just separated from your love hallelujah amen but then you must avoid the second death while you are still here the first death you still have a chance of Resurrection but you can avoid the second day amen amen and it says the people that have this Spirit the angels of God visit them hallelujah amen to reveal and to bring a message from God to the individual you see the spirit that raised Jesus from the is your birth right and that is the spirit that will bring you forth in the Resurrection May the Lord richly bless you amen as we stand on our feet I will invite our Deon to come forth maybe the sisters can give us a
