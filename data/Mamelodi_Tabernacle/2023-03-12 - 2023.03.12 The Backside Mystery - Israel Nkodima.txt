Description:
Title: The Backside Mystery 
This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 12 March 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the backside mystery. The Pastor read Galatians‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬-‭19‬, as the opening scripture.
“Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, and to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.”
‭‭
During the sermon the Pastor indicated that we are not born again because we have done something, but we are born again because we are the seed. There is nothing in a man that can please God, but God himself pleases himself in a man.

He also read the following scriptures, Revelation 5: 1 - 3 “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.”
Genesis‬ ‭13‬:‭5‬-‭10 “And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee?
