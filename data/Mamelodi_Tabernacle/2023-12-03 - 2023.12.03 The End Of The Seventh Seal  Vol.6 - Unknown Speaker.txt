Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol 6
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 03 Dec 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Revelation 8:1

The purpose of this message was to show the audience about the End of the Seventh seal.

What makes you an eternal believer is because, before the foundation of the world you were in the mind of God.

The people who can not keep the word from the beginning will come and go. 

God knew an eagle will be flying high and He fitted it with a vision to see from high above. Any other bird trying to fly that high will be blinded. The seventh seal is where the eagles fly. 

John recognised him as the supernatural came upon him, not just a preaching. 

God knows how to bring the eagles together and it will be through a unique ministry. 

The more you go higher the higher the revelation you receive. The eagle is not evangelistic. 

The Pastor read from the following books: 
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par: 231, 304, 307, 405 and 404.
57-0818 Time Tested Memorials of God  Par 110

says how beautiful this Spirit fi church I pray that I may someday visit love from Boston massachusett amen from which country USA Boston massachusett God bless our brother open Revelation chapter 7 chapter 8 verse one 8 verse1 Revelation 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour God bless you let's bow our head our heavenly father Yes my God here we come again Lord thanking you amen for the blessings that you have showered us with blessings up to even last night so we are also people the difference is that we were in your mind as attributes before the foundation of the world yes that's why the prophet came and said we have heard from our theophany there's difference when it comes to to hearing we don't hear with this natural ears we come from a far country the mind of God so our hearing as the word says when the brother gave his record he said that which we have heard and we have [Applause] sin this is the ministry oh that which we have heard and that's why my beloved Prophet says you have you from your theop it's not a new thing to us we don't we didn't hear from any man but from the from our theop amen so we are so dread even this morning we come here ready to hear from our theop amen thank you Lord for this word yes Lord that we just about to share among us am in Jesus Christ's name I pray for the blessings upon all those who will hear from their theop as I pray in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated okay we have to read okay uh I'm going back to this uh firstly let me quote to you this the seventh seal Seven Seals seven and this is the seventh seal it says we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time right amen just there meaning that we are living time as this is the end when time in then what happens then we are going back to Before Time Time put us in this bodies but before we were in the mind of of God as attributes and that's why my Prophet says before it can be a word it is a thought in a mind now what makes you a believer an eternal believer is because before the foundation of the world you were in the mind of God Amen that's the only thing that can make you a real amen amen amen and I was reading something here H I'm going to watch my clock you know brother Brenham brother BR is God's prophet why we know that he is God's Prophet it is because we were together it's not we don't hear from the people that's why brother B says you have now if you have heard already then the message that is coming forth is not from the people the Mind of Men is so shallow that's why even if we come to the service we sit to hear from to hear what we have heard now if we say Amen that is because the utterance is something that we we have he now sometimes men can preach taking off the jacket and jumping down and so but to a predestinated being he doesn't just taken up by such no he has heard that's why the scripture says that which we have amen not last Sunday amen amen and that which we have heard and have SE declare we unto you okay amen meaning if somebody comes with the things that he has is here can you tell that person something he has already H from his now if you preach to such a person you should be preaching from the the and your preaching will will be as it is told in the Bible what we have heard it says from the beginning in the beginning was the way all right amen now if there's somebody who has heard the word from the beginning you can't convince such a person with any word he has already [Music] heard right Amen in the beginning was the word am all right that's why you see people coming going they cannot keep the word from the beginning some come and take some few notes and go as I said last time the church was not started by quotations no it is the blood of [Music] Christ and we you know if then you were coming after the word that God has blessed us with you see where we are going now Beyond [Music] time and we are looking at you you'll see when we come to this notable one the angel okay amen so I read something here it goes this way remember this seventh seal is the end of time of all things right amen you can't start anything now I can't start a church I don't have men cannot start a church because he has not that blood for to start a [Music] church it was started by the Holy Blood of God when they looked at that blood they realized that it is it was not human blood they couldn't find human blood in the Lord Jesus Christ the the Bible says we were bought of the blood of God the blood what can the blood of God make you to be all right amen now you as The Offspring uh from God washed in the blood of the Lamb that lamp was not like this lamp you see you know while the people were in sin there was the word of God which came to Jordan there is Jordan there was an eagle a great Eagle brother Bram says it was an eagle on the banks of the [Music] river now this Eagle was there in order to introduce Christ [Music] chist that great his ministry was not for any other thing but was only to introduce the Great Eagle that came there Riv Jordan send to me and you amen that's why we are iglet an eagle can see far away they call it a majestic B and brother bam says for for for an eagle to see better it has to go up if there's something here and the eagle can't see that amen then it goes up the more it goes up the better it can see now you as an e you are just like your father the more you go out the more you can see better Majestic brothers and sisters I now let let us read here now that's why you know it is the time for the Eagles to take their flight the other birs can also fly as far as an eagle [Applause] can because if you go higher you must have the vision of an eagle if you can try to go high you'll be Blended and the eagle was armed amen amen God knowing that it will it will fly high he fitted it with a vision all right amen now when the Seven Seals I mean the seventh seal you watch the seventh that's when the Eagles take off that's why the prophet says even the interpretation was flying amen amen he speaks of the flying interpretation meaning that only the Eagles will understand and receive okay amen the mother Eagle gives birth to a baby eagle okay let's look at this now H I'm going back to this for for few minutes again I read here page 562 562 of the seventh seal now you should know that the seventh is the highest that's why it was supposed to be an eagle to introduce that eagle because this Eagle John didn't see him when he was standing there but he followed him until he saw even a spirit coming like a upon him he recognized him when he saw the supernatural not just a preaching amen amen you know there's been there have been preachings after preachings but man is getting nowhere because your preaching should be from above that's why we are reading now about the Eagles food the church ages over did you see how it ended it is over uh we we have reached the height where you can even introduce the VES because it says we have passed the seven Church [Music] AG can we go back there we can now you listen I will I will read here uh you notice now for the End of Time message did you hear that there is the end of time message right amen it is for the people H who came from eternity and they were putting the bodies of time now the seventh seal introduced the End of Time the seventh SE is the End of Time message amen amen now if you go beyond that you enter into something higher than any man's [Music] thoughts amen he says I knew not this SE they've been revealed this week that week and he speaks he says uh did anybody think of that of those seven angels being this being the message that was coming forth it was introduced to him of the message that was coming forth the message after the message I believe now the bride of Christ the message after the message I can't leave should you take me back there I can't leave there amen now listen to this you know that's why uh I've been listening to many things saying amen amen now they are talking to themselves when the Lord Jesus was working here on Earth he was mocked he was called King of the Demons amen amen amen when I heard somebody calling me when I he that that doesn't make me angry so they said to the Lord Jesus Christ you he didn't anger the Lord because what do you expect from the opp Opposite all right amen and the Lord just carried on all right am if he was called King of the Demons What more about calling the Creator King of the demon what do you expect if you believe him now let's here now it says I read this part uh see the Angels coming because the whole message has changed it's now after this church ages Church you know it's time ages then what is beyond timeing that if he says he speaks about the end of the church ages then what's next eternity that's where even angels are introduced and so for that's ET now let me read to you something here uh remember the seventh messenger the seventh messenger then he says the noted one to me the seventh angel yeah the noted one is the one you are looking at that one is noted among the other Angels you know if we we were in Mal at a certain place I remember I can't remember the name of the place but a a man w we were at the at the lake he he he introduced to us the Eagles now while we were standing there he said to us I want I'm going to feed the Eagles now we wonder this man how is he going to feed the and they had pieces of Flesh myself I don't know about others I was wondering this man is going to feed the eag where are they there was no but he says I want to show you feed the [Music] Eagles while I was watching you and then he started to do this H he called to this Eagles in a certain way amen amen and uh who are they yes yes the brother was there brother mang was that mangi yeah the place is called mangi you know what he did he has a piece of Flesh and he throw that into the air but before that he made a certain sound I think no no other B could answer to that because it was just for the Eagles God knows how to bring the Eagles together amen it will be a unique am [Music] Ministry so now when he made that sound then I'm I'm looking at him because there's no eag then he he took one piece of threw it but when he did that an eagle came from there from a tree we didn't know that but that piece of Flesh an [Music] eag amen am then I was there was no sign amen amen but that peace what the Eagles feed on and we didn't know that in this seven Church ages Church there some special [Music] people you know eag don't eat like other beds when I look at that I realize that no other bed is coming only an eag because it is special food for the eag it will be coming from at only throws that of eag is there picks it [Music] up and fly back then the second piece another eag is then we realize we been among the eag but something revealed them you know it is just like church ages Church AG there's a time when the Eagles the eagle flesh or food for the Eagles was displayed all right amen and one special thing about an eagle it can feed from high is that right amen all right amen then you can see also with the church ages when the time for the eagle to be seen comes he open the seals the seals opened at the time of the eag because some other B will never even understand and I realize that no other bed was attracted by that piece of meat the eagle Asing all right amen now that's why even today I know that for to call an eagle I must bring a special I can call call for prayer allance and so for Jesus is for the E it should be [Music] special all right amen because it can fly a majestic bed loved the eag so much that's why he likened John to walking on the watching and when that great Eagle landed there John look at it amen amen am and he saw it then he said beh behold the lamp of [Music] God who else could see him but it was an eagle now the real message closing now of the eag you know the more you go higher the more the Revelation you receive we you are taken up by the Revelation amen am amen amen an eagle is not Evangelistic an Eagle When it comes it won't introdu to you just the gospel but it comes from above it will introduce to you the highest [Music] like we are going to we'll follow this things and introduce the noble [Music] one you don't hear any men say the noble one then yeah the notable one okay God bless you my brother now let's let's close with this uh we will still carry on as okay I will reach this part uh this is something I started with saying I I knew not the seals but how they were introduced when he did not know and he says seven angels you know from seven churches he didn't know but then came seven angels not seven churches Church seven angels amen amen you know we were talking about you must sa [Music] love because it was all types of [Music] beds but when the time of the Eagles come you can't even say love one another because that is their nature to love one another you can't preach to the Eagles about the Love of [Music] Money if I preach to you the love of M I'm evangelizing uh somebody bought a a car that can go fast he knows it why use that this car once he start off amen amen now he cannot say to e car I'm going to drive you and I want you to go fast no the speed is in that [Applause] [Music] car that's why I'm saying talk to the Eagles it is when like when God if you can find God talking to The Offspring I've seen many a time a mama trying to teach a child to speak but what puzzled me you just hear amen he's not saying you ask him why what are you doing he says I'm teaching him te to speak now I end up not knowing who's teaching because he says okay amen all right amen I don't believe Elijah God taught Elijah no it was Elijah if God creates an eagle he will put the engine of eagle amen so each and every being as a kind of Angel like right now uh the gospel if I sit down to listen and you will come you say repent repent and be baptized you you would not be talking to me amen all right amen now I let me read something the last thing here we we we are still going on we have the the notable one we have the white stone we are going there was a white stone in the pyramid and even the church is built upon a [Music] rock and brother we listen to that he will come in the book blasphemous namas speaks about the rock confession is that as I said in Malawi we were walking alongside Lake Mala we came to some big boulders then I said to a do you see this rocks when the Lord Jesus was here they can give you a testimony amen amen they were [Music] here and the people who went I shall repeat uh I I I won't say I know the people went Americans went to the moon and so what I'm saying is that when they arrive back according to their testimony they came with a stone they called it the Genesis Stone White Stone then I typed that all right what they say they went to another [Music] body and they came back with a white St this is according to there are testimony and while I'm on this I had a book I don't know if it is still here with me we're going to to hear things from this Books Okay amen I can I can tell you about it but I want to read it if not we we'll will read it we still coming to follow these things with those amen amen now uh what what I'm saying now is that we are talking about the things we know [Music] uh wait a bit let me leave it for next we will find it it is still there but for now uh let me read this in closing okay I will turn oh yeah here's the book I I just wanted to read this to you because we are going to come to that the white stone in the pyramid the prophet said when he the top of the pyramid was chopped now he said look inside here and when they looked there was a a what was there white St a white stone then he went where now you'll understand that man was placed Eastward but if he speaks about the Angels speaks about West I went West to connect with the angels message this is what he said and came back to do what yeah uh listen uh the third speaks about the Angels before I finish up with this guy have found the third came from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speech and they picked me up and that was coming east amen amen now don't forget this man was pleased now with the mystery of the seven cies just like it said in junior Jackson's Dre that the Lord let me interpret there we are going there the Lord willing if he doesn't come tonight on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone that were no writing on you know there he said watch look inside and the stone had no writing that's the reason I had to go west to connect with the Angel's message to come back here to reveal it to the church all right amen remember I said the next thing that will happen will be here at the church not the churches the church because Prophet when he is sent he is sent to a certain [Music] class you know the opening of The Seven SE is for a class A Certain class not every all right amen then he says then he he carries on to talk about angel very notable all right with this one the reason I had to go west to connect with this Angel's message not just a message but the Angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church when he opened the book what happened he gave the book to theth Angel message okay amen for the angel to reveal to the now this one is is human I mean in figure in stature but he's a he says that's an angel then he speaks about an angel now we'll see when he speaks about the angel with the seventh seal did you read about that an angel with the seventh seal all right amen now today because we are closing now but it is something he says unknown to the public because it is open in a threefold now you take your book Christ is the mystery of God reveal Christ the Myster of God revealed let it show you and tell you about the three F amen amen now you can ask one here and say did you hear what the brother was talking about and then he can say I didn't hear a thing all right amen will we we we look at that but what I was trying to say to you before we we enter into these things the notable one the white stone in the pyramid amen and the interpretation of the white [Music] stone have you ever had somebody talking to you about the interpretation of the okay amen but me the brothers gab we are talking about this things thousand and [Music] thousands but one in the Lord oh what I was trying to say let me close this book we still have the Lord willing a long [Music] way to go with this book this is something you know as we are going to come to this white stone yeah it says you know when H that man wanted somebody to build a bridge you know the story I want okay amen he started by saying long years ago before they had smelters this is time tested Memorials of God 1 they used to take gold and how they would know uh it was right or not all what what they do and all the slud is out of it all the IR I don't know that's Fool's Gold's gold and all the fool was out of beat it and beat it turn it beat it and and turn it until the bit seeing hisself his reflection that's how God can deal with his son you know God don't treat us like babies I know he will beat you and turn you around and beat you he sees himself in you amen yes Lord amen amen that's what God did with himself in the form of Jesus was beat around until God see himself then it says now finally it says when this man was found I'm trying to I will reduce it to because I know you know what I'm talking about when that man was hired to to build a bridge and it's a true story told by the prophet of God finally there came the first one who came I don't know how many they couldn't take the job when they went down in the sea they found that it is send then they said no we can't take the job because we can't build this bridge because it is send down now you know what I'm you know it now here comes this man and it says this one he he's a man with a reputation okay amen now he arrived now it the first thing he knew was that they must be sent amen amen but knowing that there is s he knew about the gospel of these others gospel it is not revealed about it there but he knew something beyond the S amen amen yes he knew something the people are talking about something about something about you there must be some people who would know that beyond what these people are arguing there is a genuine [Applause] thing you know you don't join the choir with the people argue but the one who knows that Beyond this arguments and Beyond the sand there's a rock so it's a true story story now the last thing is that finally that man he knew that you know brother Bram puts it right knew that be the must be a rock that's why he speaks about the rock confession each and every age had a rock confession they must reach the rock your gospel your gospel must reach the rock am if it can't reach the rock then it's not genuine now this man he also arrived at the S but he knew that Beyond this there must be so he carried on he came to where others have failed amen then from there he went deeper knowing that then must be a Rock Amen now when he went down he came to the Rock he found the rock then he went back and said sir I can build this bridge because there's a rock down there amen I came from denomination as I was coming looking for the rock then I would come to a place it's just evangelism Jesus loves you I hear that but it's not getting missed anywhere it doesn't put me anywhere amen I want to come to a place where myself I have a revelation amen I find this rock then when I received the message the first book I started to read there in amen I said yeah this this is something now the first book was God of this evil age God of this EV age when started reading that book I realized that there's something I've been missing uhhuh amen you know a Christian it's somebody like that he keeps on because he knows what he wants he must find his own reflection he must come to see someone who resembles him amen he doesn't stop until he can see [Applause] himself he don't stop halfway how do we meet him in the air all right amen because even right this this morning we are going [Music] up we meet him all right amen it doesn't mean that they'll come and lift you up come and see the Lord no that power of Resurrection should be in amen amen and it is there already in you working every time expecting to up you know the plane when it is on the runway the pilot the passengers they know that sooner we will be lifted up that's when you find a Christian even when you leave your house you don't know whether you will return back to your house because you are on the right way you are expecting to be lifted up I don't know how many of that every time there's something in that I'll be lifted up in a twinkling of h i my time is over I I would like us to stand up but stand up saying until then [Applause] stand up saying until until then amen but until then I will go see is that until then until then with joy [Applause] until the day
