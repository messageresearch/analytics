[1:11:46] morrow after they had eaten of the old
[1:11:49] corn of the land neither have the
[1:11:51] children of Israel Mana anymore but they
[1:11:55] did eat of the fruit of the land of
[1:11:57] Canaan that year and it came to pass
[1:12:01] when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[1:12:04] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[1:12:07] there stood a man over against him with
[1:12:10] his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua
[1:12:13] went unto
[1:12:15] him and said unto him are thou for us of
[1:12:19] for our
[1:12:21] adversaries and he said nay but as
[1:12:24] Captain of the host of the Lord I am now
[1:12:27] come and Joshua fell on his face to the
[1:12:30] Earth and did worship and said unto him
[1:12:34] what saith my Lord unto his servant and
[1:12:37] the captain of the Lord's host said unto
[1:12:39] Joshua lose thy shoe from off thy feet
[1:12:44] foot for the place whereon thou standest
[1:12:48] is Holy and Joshua did
[1:12:51] so okay let's B ahead brother
[1:12:56] will uh lead us in
[1:13:08] prayer we are approaching a very
[1:13:11] important moment in our
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:24] lives for
[1:14:05] let everyone let every concentration be
[1:14:08] in the service as you address us oh God
[1:14:11] and we shall give you all the honor and
[1:14:13] all the glory in the precious and
[1:14:15] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[1:14:17] Jesus Christ amen amen you you may be
[1:14:21] seated God bless
[1:14:23] you okay
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:30] okay as I've said we together
[1:14:35] again you remember last time I I had a
[1:14:39] title
[1:14:42] yeah I think we are continue with the
[1:14:45] same
[1:14:49] title it will be part
[1:14:52] two the title was the
[1:14:58] migration of the process as
[1:15:04] attributes I'm sure you still I'm sure
[1:15:06] you still remember
[1:15:09] that that we we are processed from
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:16] God and when we are processed from
[1:15:21] God that makes us the the the the
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:28] attributes now when you are uh the
[1:15:33] attribute of
[1:15:36] God there's no way that you can get
[1:15:42] lost and there is no way that you can
[1:15:44] miss the
[1:15:50] Rapture
[1:15:51] and there is no way that you could do
[1:15:54] what you don't
[1:15:59] understand
[1:16:01] because you are a minor
[1:16:08] God now now the migration as we
[1:16:11] explained last
[1:16:15] time that is the the
[1:16:19] movement from one
[1:16:23] part to another
[1:16:27] like we we we were in
[1:16:31] him then we become the
[1:16:34] attributes and you all know what
[1:16:36] happened in the garden of
[1:16:40] Ed and then after uh
[1:16:46] God uh redeemed
[1:16:50] us then we start our journey back home
[1:16:56] then we we migrated
[1:16:59] now you know uh the the the
[1:17:05] animals they they've got this seasonal
[1:17:08] migration like I've explained
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] last they migrate through
[1:17:21] seasons and we also m
[1:17:26] we migrate according to the different
[1:17:35] dispensations and when we we we
[1:17:39] migrate according to the
[1:17:42] dispensation each and every
[1:17:47] dispensation uh it's got a
[1:17:52] region you migrate from
[1:17:56] one region of
[1:18:00] life to
[1:18:03] another and the reason is
[1:18:06] what the reason is for the changing of
[1:18:09] your
[1:18:13] body because there's another level or
[1:18:16] region where you will
[1:18:20] reach that does not necessarily need
[1:18:23] this for
[1:18:27] amen now we
[1:18:29] all have to
[1:18:34] know uh the the time that we are living
[1:18:39] in and what is expected of
[1:18:45] us it's not just a matter of going to
[1:18:48] the
[1:18:51] service but you are received
[1:18:55] and if you are
[1:18:58] Ace then you are an
[1:19:02] attribute and then you
[1:19:05] had to uh produce what you
[1:19:12] are okay let me take the example that
[1:19:16] the pastor always gives
[1:19:21] us he will always uh
[1:19:25] speak
[1:19:26] about uh the the the
[1:19:33] flight because we've read now that when
[1:19:36] when Joshua crossed the river
[1:19:41] Jordan he met an
[1:19:44] angel now after meeting that
[1:19:47] angel then that angel said I I am the
[1:19:51] captain of The Host
[1:19:55] these
[1:19:56] people that you are
[1:19:59] leading I am their
[1:20:03] K so when he is
[1:20:08] the then now after crossing
[1:20:12] over the captain took
[1:20:17] over but the Myer
[1:20:20] is it was Joshua Contin
[1:20:25] but
[1:20:26] actually it was not
[1:20:28] jhua it was
[1:20:33] a now brother Brenham brother preached
[1:20:38] about the seven Church
[1:20:43] ages the Bible
[1:20:46] says he was to
[1:20:48] turn their
[1:20:52] heart sure we've just sang
[1:20:55] what you call it
[1:20:56] song behold I will send you Elijah
[1:21:01] the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:21:05] Lord now he will do
[1:21:13] what
[1:21:15] not not not
[1:21:18] hearts a
[1:21:21] heart one heart
[1:21:26] now why is it not
[1:21:31] HS it is
[1:21:34] because when they were waiting for the
[1:21:37] holy
[1:21:39] ghost in the upper
[1:21:43] room the Bible says they were one
[1:21:48] mind one
[1:21:50] heart one spirit
[1:21:55] now now when you you you speak about the
[1:21:58] bride you speak about you we not
[1:22:01] speaking about the
[1:22:09] bride they are one
[1:22:14] heart one
[1:22:16] Spirit one
[1:22:19] mind that's that's what we
[1:22:22] are those are the attributes of
[1:22:27] God when they
[1:22:30] move when they
[1:22:32] migrate they migrate being one
[1:22:37] heart one one
[1:22:42] Spirit now when we
[1:22:47] migrate with different
[1:22:50] Hearts will take different direction
[1:22:56] and once we take different
[1:22:59] direction we become
[1:23:04] vulnerable because we are no more
[1:23:09] one so now the pastor will always speak
[1:23:13] about the
[1:23:16] flight remember now the
[1:23:20] ministry he is of the captain of the
[1:23:23] host remember
[1:23:27] when brother Bram
[1:23:30] brother preached about the seven
[1:23:36] churches after that he went
[1:23:42] what then when he
[1:23:44] came he came with a new
[1:23:48] commission new
[1:23:50] ministry the ministry was of the angel
[1:23:56] because he went
[1:23:59] Westward he met an
[1:24:04] angel right then when he came
[1:24:07] back the ministry was off
[1:24:13] that when Joshua crossed
[1:24:16] over he met an
[1:24:19] Angel and the ministry became off angel
[1:24:26] but we see
[1:24:28] Joshua righten and we see
[1:24:32] brother saying I am going
[1:24:38] eastwards to open the
[1:24:42] se you see amen and the Bible
[1:24:47] says John
[1:24:51] cried and then it was said to John
[1:24:58] Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:25:02] Judah has
[1:25:05] prevailed not
[1:25:08] brother the lion of
[1:25:12] the but then who opened the
[1:25:17] SS I'm going
[1:25:21] eastwards to open the SE
[1:25:25] the Bible
[1:25:27] says the lamb took the
[1:25:32] book you see amen now that's where now
[1:25:37] you see the cream of the
[1:25:43] Bride exactly what is happening
[1:25:47] there you you miss that
[1:25:51] one it's difficult to cross over
[1:25:57] it's
[1:25:59] difficult to recognize the ministry of
[1:26:02] that
[1:26:05] angel the
[1:26:07] angel that FW
[1:26:11] brother are we together and you will
[1:26:14] miss
[1:26:17] what brother said have you met
[1:26:24] you will miss
[1:26:26] that you will want
[1:26:28] somebody that you are going to meet
[1:26:32] physically and you won't find
[1:26:35] him right amen so now when when he
[1:26:39] speaks about the flight that is about to
[1:26:42] take
[1:26:46] off now he speaks
[1:26:50] about the the order
[1:26:57] inside and
[1:26:58] outside what what was happening
[1:27:02] outside and what was happening
[1:27:05] inside when the
[1:27:07] captain is on the
[1:27:13] cockpit and then you will only hear the
[1:27:17] rumbling and the running of engines
[1:27:19] outside
[1:27:26] once the C
[1:27:30] crew can close the
[1:27:34] door now which
[1:27:36] means the one that is on
[1:27:40] outside can't come
[1:27:42] in the ministry
[1:27:46] differs outside you hear the rumbling of
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:52] engine and the captain now
[1:27:55] take
[1:27:56] control he's the one now you'll always
[1:28:00] see him looking at the
[1:28:03] dashboard giving instructions to the
[1:28:08] C checking his
[1:28:11] departure and cruising
[1:28:14] time and his Landing
[1:28:19] time now the captain's Ministry
[1:28:24] is directed to the
[1:28:28] Overcomers and
[1:28:31] the will tell you relax
[1:28:35] welcome
[1:28:37] welcome our flight will go like this
[1:28:42] in in other words he says fear
[1:28:46] not I am
[1:28:50] the he will even tell
[1:28:52] you that we going to find a cross
[1:28:58] wind he wouldn't
[1:29:00] say he wouldn't
[1:29:03] say well we don't
[1:29:08] know will see whether will
[1:29:12] arrive because there
[1:29:16] thunderstorms cross
[1:29:18] wind we don't
[1:29:21] know no he will just relax
[1:29:27] we're going to meet
[1:29:30] cross but we'll
[1:29:33] just and those that know they speak very
[1:29:40] simply no we will do
[1:29:42] that even when the cross wind comes you
[1:29:46] will just fasten yourself
[1:29:49] well we were crossing
[1:29:52] through and you were cruising
[1:29:56] through so that that is his
[1:30:00] ministry the the ministry is
[1:30:04] fear he he he is
[1:30:09] the he is in
[1:30:13] control yeah beautiful now the
[1:30:19] concentration is
[1:30:21] now fear not
[1:30:26] those were taking their relatives to the
[1:30:33] airport have kissed them and Bing them
[1:30:39] goodbye they will know what is going
[1:30:42] on they will be driving
[1:30:45] home but the one that will be now right
[1:30:50] inside would have identified his seat
[1:30:53] number
[1:30:58] so he will be relaxing concentration on
[1:31:01] his
[1:31:05] journey
[1:31:07] now remember that PO and F is not
[1:31:17] allowed no there's a special
[1:31:22] men after you've crossed
[1:31:25] over there's
[1:31:29] no no the menu
[1:31:35] changes it's now another
[1:31:40] menu we had sisters I think I don't know
[1:31:45] whether they were going to Cape Town or
[1:31:52] well they had their
[1:31:56] crew said no no no
[1:32:00] BR so now when when when you cross
[1:32:03] over the ministry
[1:32:06] changes we we will read that I'm just
[1:32:09] giving you Direction where we
[1:32:12] going remember there's a special
[1:32:18] menu when Israel crossed
[1:32:21] over she started to eat
[1:32:26] the fruit of the
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:30] land right remember that we we we we we
[1:32:35] have seven major
[1:32:38] Visions still remember
[1:32:43] them now our
[1:32:45] ministry is this way there was the
[1:32:49] first major Vision you know
[1:32:54] that one of
[1:32:55] molini and the second
[1:32:58] one was ADF Hitler you know

[1:33:24] that will
[1:33:28] swallow you see and the prophet said
[1:33:33] Beware and
[1:33:35] watch the King of the
[1:33:38] North was referring

[1:34:36] de yeah and then uh the the
[1:34:43] creators
[1:34:45] smoke over
[1:34:47] America so we we have all the
[1:34:51] guidelines now this
[1:34:55] Ministry that now is the inside
[1:35:01] Ministry
[1:35:04] uh he says
[1:35:07] now the the last major vision is is the
[1:35:11] one
[1:35:12] that America will be in
[1:35:20] creatures right remember we take uh the
[1:35:24] Old Testament as a
[1:35:29] shadow and then we are on the new
[1:35:32] test we take what happened to the
[1:35:36] Jews and then how did they they they
[1:35:39] they they they refused their
[1:35:44] Messiah and then we come to our
[1:35:49] site we see how in our time
[1:35:54] the Lord was
[1:35:58] rejected now we the Beast is now
[1:36:04] ready the King of the
[1:36:08] North need to be
[1:36:13] provoked because the prophet
[1:36:16] says behold the King of the
[1:36:21] North now the King of the North will
[1:36:24] never
[1:36:27] Strike unless he's
[1:36:31] provoked because the bomb is
[1:36:36] ready the Buton is
[1:36:40] ready it needs somebody just to press
[1:36:44] the it needs just people to come and
[1:36:49] provoke the King of the North is ready
[1:36:54] need to be
[1:36:57] provoked those that listen to the
[1:37:00] news they know that there is
[1:37:06] provocation and the king of the not keep
[1:37:09] on
[1:37:11] saying I will just press a
[1:37:15] button and
[1:37:18] destroy you see
[1:37:20] amen so the major vision
[1:37:25] needs to be
[1:37:28] completed but I don't think that will be
[1:37:32] here yeah the Vatican is
[1:37:37] ready
[1:37:39] remember the
[1:37:41] prophet spoke about
[1:37:45] America
[1:37:47] Russia and the
[1:37:51] vaan those are the three spoke
[1:37:55] about America is a powerful
[1:38:00] Nation
[1:38:02] together Russia is the King of the
[1:38:06] North that is not history it's what is
[1:38:11] happening and what is happening about
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:16] Vatican they when when when when Russia
[1:38:20] Russia was fighting which countries
[1:38:26] what UK Ukraine Ukraine they ask the
[1:38:31] pope actually what are you saying about
[1:38:37] it he said I'm seeing two
[1:38:41] Devils fighting it depends which devil
[1:38:48] wins but from there
[1:38:51] on he went now
[1:38:54] now and
[1:38:56] open the holy
[1:39:00] doors those who
[1:39:04] follows these
[1:39:07] things the media
[1:39:11] says Pope
[1:39:14] Francis Francis open the the Five Holy
[1:39:19] doors
[1:39:24] to
[1:39:26] inaugurate the
[1:39:28] 2025
[1:39:34] Jubilee now I won't say much about
[1:39:38] remember there are
[1:39:41] demons that were
[1:39:43] bound on the river
[1:39:46] e and the prophet said during the second
[1:39:50] World War
[1:39:53] some of them were
[1:39:57] released then you know what happened in
[1:39:59] the
[1:40:03] Holocaust those were those
[1:40:07] demons now the
[1:40:10] river
[1:40:13] euph it's
[1:40:15] dry when it's

[1:40:20] demons are coming out
[1:40:24] when when they are coming
[1:40:26] out somebody's opening
[1:40:31] doors there's a spirit that must
[1:40:38] descend when Jesus
[1:40:41] Christ was with his
[1:40:44] disciples he said you were I chosen
[1:40:50] 12 one of you
[1:40:53] is a
[1:40:56] devil and then on that
[1:40:59] day he
[1:41:03] descended to
[1:41:07] Judas it was
[1:41:10] difficult for Judas to shake it
[1:41:14] off when the spirit
[1:41:17] descend and the wrong Spirit descend on
[1:41:21] individual and find a
[1:41:25] place it's difficult to shake it
[1:41:29] off
[1:41:32] especi when you are
[1:41:36] predestinated for
[1:41:39] condemnation remember
[1:41:42] some are
[1:41:44] predestinated for eternal

[1:43:49] body now we cannot change the body
[1:43:54] without the
[1:43:56] ministry that will make us to change
[1:44:01] our that is why we can't go
[1:44:05] backward I'll read you the scripture of
[1:44:08] those that uh fail to
[1:44:13] cross but after after we are
[1:44:17] gone there are two
[1:44:21] prophets then the prophet said what will
[1:44:24] they
[1:44:25] do it's Moses and
[1:44:28] Elijah it says they will rise on the
[1:44:32] sin I believe they are already
[1:44:37] ready because their Min should be only 3
[1:44:41] and a half years after

[1:45:16] ready Moses and
[1:45:18] Elijah they'll tell these Jews their
[1:45:22] mistake
[1:45:27] what is their
[1:45:29] mistake the Bible says they were
[1:45:34] blinded so that we could be
[1:45:39] crafted right amen and we were grafted
[1:45:44] in now we are called the the
[1:45:48] Gentiles and our time is over
[1:45:53] amen right amen then he must go back to
[1:45:56] the
[1:45:57] Jews those two prophets they will tell
[1:46:01] the
[1:46:02] Jews their
[1:46:04] mistake that you crucified
[1:46:08] him and out of that Jewish
[1:46:12] bunch there's to be
[1:46:15] 144,000
[1:46:17] 144,000 God will
[1:46:20] call only 144
[1:46:24] 14,000 then the prophet
[1:46:26] continues and say what is
[1:46:29] it the
[1:46:31] spirit of
[1:46:33] Elijah I'm sure you reading
[1:46:36] there it says the spirit of
[1:46:40] elij can you see that
[1:46:44] off it's no it's not o and
[1:46:49] F it's O and dou F
[1:46:54] what is the difference o and f o
[1:47:07] f when it says
[1:47:11] off it says the spirit of
[1:47:14] Elijah off the Gentile
[1:47:20] Church spirit moves off
[1:47:23] from the
[1:47:26] Gentile it leaves the
[1:47:28] Gentiles because the ministry is
[1:47:31] finished behold I send you Elijah the
[1:47:35] prophet and then Elijah the prophet has
[1:47:39] done his job now that Spirit now
[1:47:42] moves moves now
[1:47:45] off the
[1:47:47] Gentiles he will
[1:47:49] continue right into that Jewish Church
[1:47:55] go right on in and call
[1:48:01] Moses right call Moses and he Contin
[1:48:06] says and he will preach the same
[1:48:11] message
[1:48:12] Pentecost to those
[1:48:15] Jews they rejected the
[1:48:18] Messiah right amen it will be the same
[1:48:21] Pentecostal music
[1:48:23] I mean
[1:48:27] message that these Jews will
[1:48:30] preach right over
[1:48:33] them and they hate those
[1:48:39] Jews you see when you have the
[1:48:42] ministry the last
[1:48:45] Ministry you will be
[1:48:47] hated because the L
[1:48:50] Ministry is the one that corners the
[1:48:56] devil that is the end of
[1:48:59] him it exposes
[1:49:03] him
[1:49:05] right so
[1:49:07] now they they they supposed to hate
[1:49:11] them and kill
[1:49:14] them but they will
[1:49:18] resurrect they just done remember
[1:49:24] it's not
[1:49:25] you who believe the word of
[1:49:30] God is the word of God in
[1:49:35] you that believe the word of
[1:49:38] God is the word of
[1:49:40] God believing the word of
[1:49:42] God you are just a
[1:49:48] carrier that is why right now
[1:49:53] we are in this time the Bible
[1:49:56] says let
[1:49:59] him who is
[1:50:01] filthy continue there's nothing that you
[1:50:04] can do with
[1:50:06] him right at the end let him
[1:50:11] continue and let the one that is
[1:50:14] Holy continue with his
[1:50:18] holy you won't change you will not
[1:50:21] change him also
[1:50:23] yeah you you see amen now let's go back
[1:50:27] to the
[1:50:29] Scriptures it says
[1:50:31] now uh Joshua chapter
[1:50:35] 5 and verse 12 ver
[1:50:39] says now
[1:50:42] therefore is it right no I'm reading a
[1:50:44] wrong chapter
[1:50:47] yeah it says and the Mana seized on the
[1:50:56] moru after they've eaten the old corn of
[1:50:59] the
[1:51:02] land you see now there's a manner of the
[1:51:06] seven
[1:51:09] church and there's the manner of the
[1:51:13] seals they are not the
[1:51:16] same amen so you are
[1:51:21] born in the church
[1:51:24] ages you grow and grow and grow I was
[1:51:33] in then I was telling some
[1:51:38] sisters that
[1:51:41] uh when uh the the Holy
[1:51:46] Ghost landed on Jesus
[1:51:50] Christ because he's typing that
[1:51:54] the
[1:51:56] lamb right amen and then when it
[1:52:02] LS it starts now to uh build a
[1:52:08] church now there's so many
[1:52:11] people that will say my church my
[1:52:15] church so now the Holy Ghost is the one
[1:52:19] that builded the
[1:52:21] church but remember the Holy Ghost is in
[1:52:25] the
[1:52:28] man
[1:52:29] right and then you
[1:52:32] grow you know the the the the the the
[1:52:35] the
[1:52:37] the the
[1:52:39] virtues is that you have
[1:52:42] faith you have a
[1:52:46] virtue you have a
[1:52:50] knowledge you have a temp
[1:52:55] you have
[1:52:58] patience you have
[1:53:01] godliness you have brotherly
[1:53:05] kindness now these things the Bible says
[1:53:10] if you lack one of
[1:53:12] them it's impossible for God to adopt
[1:53:16] you
[1:53:22] it says you see
[1:53:27] vividly you can't go further
[1:53:30] on so you cannot cross over because when
[1:53:34] you have
[1:53:35] them then God says this is my beloved
[1:53:42] sister and is my beloved
[1:53:45] Son it's not something that you can
[1:53:50] create God gives you
[1:53:55] are we together now from there on then
[1:53:58] you eat now
[1:54:02] EA let's read it again and the Mana
[1:54:05] seized on the morrow after they had
[1:54:07] eaten of the old
[1:54:16] cor that land amen neither had the
[1:54:19] children of Israel I mean sorry
[1:54:22] neither had the children of Israel Mana
[1:54:32] anymore right amen but they did eat of
[1:54:36] the fruit of the land of
[1:54:48] Canaan okay let's go to numbers
[1:54:53] Numbers chapter
[1:54:58] 32 and then let's read verse 2 to
[1:55:05] 10 I hope you
[1:55:08] understand but now we are in a stage
[1:55:11] where now we
[1:55:16] understand uh that
[1:55:19] now actually somebody
[1:55:23] must take
[1:55:25] over and let us cross
[1:55:29] over so when brother
[1:55:32] Brenham
[1:55:34] departed he gave the Bon to the
[1:55:39] pastors now it it can really surprise
[1:55:44] you he said I'm going
[1:55:49] eastwards to open the seals
[1:55:53] now after I open the
[1:55:55] se he said the seventh
[1:55:59] seal is within
[1:56:01] me but the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:56:07] pastors right amen and they are the
[1:56:12] one that will give you your
[1:56:17] inheritance are we together now and here
[1:56:20] we are saying now
[1:56:22] the ministry is of the cap I mean it's
[1:56:25] of the
[1:56:27] yes it's of an
[1:56:29] Angel it's a Ministry of an
[1:56:32] angel now it start from
[1:56:35] here behind the
[1:56:37] pit the the
[1:56:41] angel of the
[1:56:43] church that is behind
[1:56:45] the will be the
[1:56:47] one that will give you your inheritance
[1:56:54] amen before we read on let's go to
[1:56:56] Hebrews I want I want us to we'll come
[1:56:59] back to this
[1:57:00] one let's go to the book
[1:57:04] of chapter
[1:57:07] 13 because when
[1:57:11] God speaks about
[1:57:15] himself but he will point a
[1:57:19] man to manifest
[1:57:23] what he was speaking
[1:57:27] about listen to verse
[1:57:29] 17
[1:57:31] 1 obey them that have the rule over you
[1:57:35] wait a
[1:57:36] bit obey them
[1:57:39] that a rule over
[1:57:44] you people don't want to be
[1:57:50] ruled amen that is why even at
[1:57:54] work they they
[1:57:57] struggle because at work there is
[1:58:00] directing
[1:58:02] manager is looking after the
[1:58:06] company and they are
[1:58:12] managers and they are
[1:58:17] supervisors now each and
[1:58:19] everyone is responsible
[1:58:23] and he's a
[1:58:25] leader so now if you can't listen to
[1:58:28] your
[1:58:32] supervisor you won't listen to the
[1:58:34] directing
[1:58:38] man because he's
[1:58:42] expressing what the the direct manager
[1:58:45] is
[1:58:47] [Applause]
[1:58:50] saying look look some of the traffic
[1:58:54] cops when you look at
[1:58:57] him he's just a young boy seems to be
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:08] useless from but but he could stand and
[1:59:16] stop big truck and give instructions
[1:59:23] the driver dare disrespect
[1:59:27] him he can take the
[1:59:30] keys he can remove everything and call
[1:59:33] another truck to come and pull
[1:59:36] this because he's
[1:59:41] authorized that is why when brother
[1:59:43] Harvest read said wait a
[1:59:46] bit I I want this to
[1:59:50] sink because it
[1:59:54] says read it again my brother verse
[1:59:58] 17 oby them that have the rule over you
[2:00:02] who's got the rule over
[2:00:05] you and then what does it says again and
[2:00:08] submit yourselves yes for they watch
[2:00:12] over your souls look the angel of the
[2:00:17] church is watching over your soul
[2:00:23] he's the
[2:00:24] one that will give you your
[2:00:29] inheritance now when you're going to say
[2:00:32] no now I'm going to be given by
[2:00:36] Christ and then where is your
[2:00:40] Christ let him come and give
[2:00:44] you now Christ has given it to the
[2:00:49] angel the prophet
[2:00:52] the angel the
[2:00:54] prophet gave it to the
[2:00:56] angel behind
[2:00:59] theit Angel behind the pit gave it to
[2:01:03] the
[2:01:08] angels so you have to
[2:01:11] know when the prophet says have You Met
[2:01:16] m means you have you met your angel
[2:01:23] when he says have you met your
[2:01:25] angel not referring to a
[2:01:30] man is referring to the man that will
[2:01:33] give you the word as it
[2:01:39] is a man that won't sacrifice
[2:01:44] with regardless of what people
[2:01:48] say the
[2:01:52] because he's an angel and you when you
[2:01:55] have received it you won't compromise
[2:01:58] about comprom because you're are an
[2:02:01] angel you stick to
[2:02:04] it you know your
[2:02:06] destination and you know how far are
[2:02:11] you are we
[2:02:13] together no brother Harvest it
[2:02:16] continues you you see it he watches for
[2:02:19] your soul
[2:02:22] there somebody that is watching your
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] soul a human
[2:02:28] being is
[2:02:32] watching right
[2:02:35] amen because it
[2:02:39] continues as they that must give account
[2:02:43] right your pastor must give account
[2:02:46] about
[2:02:48] you whether you like it or not
[2:02:54] if it's
[2:02:56] off the word and you miss
[2:03:02] it you miss the
[2:03:04] Rapture you're going for a
[2:03:07] judgment and in the Judgment you will
[2:03:10] say
[2:03:12] no no my pastor didn't teach me about
[2:03:16] this then they would say give account
[2:03:18] pastor
[2:03:22] because the Bible
[2:03:24] says as they must give
[2:03:30] account so that when they give
[2:03:34] account that they may do it with
[2:03:38] joy and not with with
[2:03:42] grief you see when you are doing a wrong
[2:03:45] thing it Grieves your pastor
[2:03:52] because he's the one that is looking
[2:03:56] after your
[2:03:57] soul he's the one that must give
[2:04:02] account now when he speak to
[2:04:05] you he speak to you with a grieving
[2:04:10] spirit because you are not doing the
[2:04:12] right
[2:04:14] thing that gries
[2:04:17] hisory but if you are right he will say
[2:04:20] no
[2:04:22] uh this
[2:04:24] brother will be with me in New
[2:04:31] Jerusalem you will always hear him
[2:04:34] saying there are people that are going
[2:04:37] to be with
[2:04:38] me in
[2:04:41] Jerusalem now he's saying that with
[2:04:45] joy but he will start saying now being
[2:04:48] grieved now
[2:04:51] there are
[2:04:52] people who are going
[2:04:55] around in social
[2:04:58] media doing this and that is grieving
[2:05:05] him they're doing this
[2:05:09] and now he's giving
[2:05:13] account under
[2:05:15] a ging
