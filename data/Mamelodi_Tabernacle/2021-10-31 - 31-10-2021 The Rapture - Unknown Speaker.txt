one part of it the lord willing we shall continue we are we have arrived at the time of the rapture it will be as it will be secret when the saints shall be taken away in a twinkling of an eye and so how loving our father is did you know that god in the form of jesus has a wife called the bride of jesus christ then just as every man is the protector of his wife the husband is the head the wife is the body amen that's how he protects the body but the god situated she situated their heart right here in the like in the middle so to show that the two are one the heart is not in the head it's in the body here to unite the upper and the law so that the two may be one now he is coming for his wife and even if he will have some thoughts of doing things never try to touch his wife he is the protector of his wife throughout the ages and this is time now for to come to take his wife amen now we will read a scripture just to introduce that we are entering that area of the rapture we've been coming up looking at the city saw give us a proper proper name what it is bride made even if they are males grooms maze all right now the 144 000 will be the grooms the bride and the groom's maze during the millennium wherever she will be they will be there what a wonderful day aren't you glad that you are part of it amen let me not go far hey let's read the word of god now we have come here to do what to magnify his name and worship him i can't magnify my poor name i'm here to magnify his glorify his name magnify his name and worship him as we open our bibles let us read this scriptures there and god bless so are you here for the word of god [Music] we are not here to talk about some other people we are not here to say bad things about the people we are not here to bewitch anybody we are not saying here to say bad things about we are here to worship him that's what i am here for all right let's read in history a moment in the twinkling of an eye that the last time for the chapter shall sound yes believe in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the way of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are saved for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead culture rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the end and so shall we okay i'm just waiting for the brother let us bow our heads in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated all right i'm just waiting for a message before we start off amen okay [Music] announcement is that the flight is from here to the new jerusalem the altitude is the seventh seal amen so if you are told that this is the end of the seventh seal you know that we are just almost there okay now i'm i will start by reading some things here the first thing it speaks of them that are asleep then i have it oh do we have it here oh yeah we have a cloud and clouds cloud the tree and i see the eye there it's also part of this morning the clouds the tree and the eye yeah part of this morning because in jerusalem we are going to see things and i think they are trying to pro to pour three years the tree in jerusalem because the light in jerusalem is christ himself don't worry about the umbrella or redeemers there amen we want to have a site like we have here and what confronts me the most is that i was told that when you are there there will still be the pleiades and some other forms of different words i understand but i'm told that should i want to go to the pleiades i don't need any form of transport your support because i will just travel like in my thought you know this body is a hindrance is a cover it is a mask but even as i'm standing here i can visualize my study room i can visualize my house but somebody else who has never been to my house must be must have a guide but not me because it is my house it is in me so leaving this place after service i will just follow the vision of the house that i have in me do you understand that when we were in heaven and god brought us here to worship him and we were planted like trees amen but he has put also in us something that is called soul and in that soul there is one we call eternity now that's why we know our way home as the bible says for our citizenship is in heaven i know i don't need a visa to go back to my home he's always there to guide me all right now listen now as we read and paul was the first messenger and you know how he he went to the third world set heaven did you do you know that scripture he says i know a man in christ who went to the third heaven [Music] it is again called the heaven of heavens and the bible of jesus it says you know when he died he went down to the outermost and from the outermost the book of luke says then he went to the highest heaven when he goes down he really goes down when he goes up he really goes up amen that's why we are looking at this now let's let's look at this for a few minutes we'll continue until we come to the place now the scripture says i show you [Music] say it and me stirring mystery is something that is not known to everybody is only known to those whom the lord has chosen and they are the keepers of the mysteries of god the real believers of this message are they keepers of the mysteries of god the keepers of the title deeds because god has given them the title deed because the title did with the title did you know who you are where you come from where you are going where you are that's the title deed holder a worshiper should be a worshipper with a title deed [Music] the person who knows where is god who is god he should know that he is coming and he should know what to do when he is coming and he should know the secret the mystery of his coming you can't make preparations unless you know the secret the preparations are made only after we have received the secret the mystery of his coming that's why we see the signs today they are pointing to that direction [Applause] uh just a couple of days ago and i but anyhow let me say it in this manner i faced some what do you call larry [Music] and the occupants of these things are called the aliens i was facing aliens one night i was called that there's aliens all right i know you don't know what i'm talking about don't worry but anyhow because it is i know it i'm saying it but if you don't understand it you need not to worry i'm just telling you about what i know peter said one day we are eyewitnesses we were with him on the mountain [Applause] and that's why they saw moses and elijah and peter didn't argue with anybody he only said we are eyewitnesses that was peter john and james he summoned them up in the mountain and while they were there they saw they saw moses and elijah just as i'm i say and some have seen these aliens it's none other person's business is the pill that's why peter says we are eyewitnesses we don't need to argue with anybody about it because we have seen it all right now let's take it from here in those days i'm going to read some things you are familiar with if you are a christian let's read what happened in those days when the people died it will tell us here so because it speaks of the dead in christ yes where is that scripture again i don't have my my other bible here but i want you to look at this carefully when we die as the prophet has taught me this the word of god when we die anyhow i know that this body is sentenced to death every time a child is born the first thing done by the parents is by trying for a security or what to do against dance again with chi because the first lily please [Music] hey value a man are going to be judged god is going to judge you for your deeds you are very well known you are known very well but let me read the scripture now i i'm not saying somebody should fear if you are a child of god there's nothing to fear let me repeat this if you are a child of god there is nothing to fear if you fear means there is something wrong let me let us read now that was the selenius chapter four today we'll just take this part then by god grace will but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them who are asleep that you may sorrow not even as others who have no hope [Music] you know should you announce death of somebody or family member to somebody he drops everything [Music] and all that amen [Music] those without hope you know my let me not mention but it's one of my relatives he said about me and my elder brother otherwise our family why she said this it is because every time we were sent to take the message you offer one disease to somebody you know they would want you to knock and going inside their house like this then they know already that you can command because yeah but now we as christians i just come in and you know so and so i i'm told that she has just passed away army now that's why they said me and my brother we don't fear death i would concerning them who are asleep that you may sorrow not just like at home in the morning you wake up but some are still asleep amen what do you do you just wait for them also to wake up so that you can meet and continue with the daily duties and so forth okay for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them who are asleep in jesus take note of that he slipped in like lazarus was sleeping but in jesus christ [Music] and who's that woman she said to jesus was it martha he said to the lord jesus i know that lazarus will rise again but in the last days and the large the lord jesus said what did he say i am the resurrection amen you know brother branham said one thing one day now i've seen it in the bible that death and life cannot come together life came to a home in the form of jesus and there was a themself that died [Music] and when he entered there were mourners in there and he said give way the resurrection has come the resurrection in the form of a man the walking the talking resurrection which is jesus christ was coming to that house of sorrow every time jesus is here all things are possible amen there is no death there's no hunger there's no as long as he is here [Music] now let us invite him in our hearts today and and not only invite him but let's keep him don't just invite him but keep him amen then he entered make way for the resurrection amen the resurrection was working and talking and came in then and the damsel was there and then he just called them sir amen he didn't pray he called them [Music] just as we are the cold ones [Applause] now death there's no death for us anymore because he has already called us [Applause] amen and that's why the bible says we have passed already because our names you go through things you are going through things then listen for hey for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even them so who are asleep also who are asleep in jesus god will bring with him amen with but the dead in christ are in christ the dead in christ meaning they are in christ absent from their bodies [Music] because a christian do not die it is your body that dies amen you are spirit soul and body the body is made of dust we can beautify it we can do whatever we do but it is aging [Music] until one day that is the body she is of age now [Music] is she still a celebrity know she has done past that because multifaceted ladybug amen you will stand up before the almighty god listening listen for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we also who are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord that's why i have it here with me them that are asleep and we which are alive take note of that we are going to follow that and them that are asleep they are still part of us you will see but in the sixth dimension and when the the prophet of god arrived there and he said where is jesus i want to see jesus and they said he is just in the seventh dimension and one day he will come down and pick us up then we will come together for the bible says he will come with them we are going to read amen and they will meet him in the air he will never set his foot here but will meet him in the air [Applause] [Music] amen and that will be the end of the is because we we have here two things we have the three and a half years of christ's prophecy [Music] then after we have the three and a half years which is called the tribulation period but that is of satan's period after the rapture did you know you hear the bible saying this revelation chapter 12 verse 10 12. verse 10. therefore verse 12 years therefore rejoice ye heavens and neither dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time i wonder if he has announced given this report to his followers addressing them to say my brothers and sisters i have my time is short has he has he announced that to his church no they don't know about it he follows god okay let's look at these brothers and sisters i'm reading who and to say it are you here with me yeah that is verse 10 12 verse 12 and my scripture and now you you come here again i i i verse 13 i'm in chapter 13 and i stood upon the scent of the sea and they saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and welcome to that the beast out of out of the sea all right as i say somebody said they were talking i was just close to them saying if then maybe like talking about how people go for their rituals initiation and to the river and so forth and the one it's a pastor i respect that pastor he said should one go in the water he will drown you know so he was referring to this underworld things and so forth then in the sea in the river there's water there's fishy fish crocodiles they don't drown amen now i refer to this coming we saw a beast rise up this beast we know to be a man here a beast coming out then if you go and you'll hear this beast talking i want i wonder how these beasts survive drowning why is caesar but he came out of the water now going down rebel you realize that this beast because we are coming now to the reincarnation of things [Music] then you realize that this beast is a man today incarnated that is satan well all right but yeah i i know it's easy verse 4 today i'll just take this small part here and they worshiped the dragon who gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast and [Music] saying who is like the beast who is able to make war with him you see they are referring to a man but out of the sea why he didn't drown and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and the power was given unto him to continue and two months how long is that three and a half years the lord jesus said he's three and a half years he has his satan also has three and a half years then that's why it says after the rapture of the earth and the sea and you realize revelation chapter 21 there is no mercy there's no place for you to hide no mercy and because he's been running his office from down we have three spheres heaven as an anger but the people are allergic to the under where they wait and did you hear that now john says every creature hated me do you know that scripture read it every creature hated me now read it will tell us creatures where okay read it you read it brother forever right john because he he saw him who had the book in his right hand who has won the battle because this book belonged to adam when adam forfeited it the original holder the keeper took it so that saturn would not see the mysteries of god that's why satan don't know about the seventh sin he doesn't know about the third pool because these are the mysteries of god that's why the rapture itself is a secret because it says in the twinkling of an eye meaning that saturn will see nothing that is in a twinkling of an eye but here now that the beast here it is now it's a man called the beast because that is incarnation and also the lord jesus did the same thing john 14 20 at that day you shall know that i am in you now he doesn't speak of the holy ghost he says i myself now i'll be in you and you in me you read john chapter 14 verse 20. it will tell you that but he says at that day there is a day when you will know that he is in you and you are in him there is a day you should know that he is in you and you in him [Applause] you should know [Applause] when will you know who who is in you you is your ruler amen what is that in your heart [Applause] okay those who are in him and he is in them they are called the true worshipers they worship god in spirit and in truth [Applause] they are not just worshipers but they worship him in [Applause] spirit and because there's so many spirits it says in truth and what is the truth it is his revelation he gives you revelation that means he's giving you the truth otherwise you'll keep on guessing [Music] they say the seventh seal is not revealed the seventh is not revealed and i read there it says that the seventh engine flew to me and that is the seventh scene brother that seventh season seen only few people have had him saying that only few that seventh seal flew straight to me and that is the seventh seal i was picked up it says your your book which book standing in the game you don't know which book okay standing in the game brother he says i was picked up by an angel to go and now don't miss this that like all the time this thing is missed i go worse i went west to open the seals for gordon i'm going to repeat it again i went west to open the seals for god now it will never pass a predestinated soul but some will hear the reading but will not hear the word you get what i mean some will hear the reading of that word but they would not hear the word because the word is god speaking to you but if the word says i was picked up and i went worse to westward to open the seals for god i can sit here the whole day i was picked up and went westward to open the seals for god we read the part last week i think in another week and that week and that week it says he tore off the seals and gave it to the seventh angel messenger for to reveal it to the church [Music] i can stand here the whole day the lord the lamp toe of the seal sent it down to the seventh seal that is that book this book was in the hands of adam the manual book is when you buy a car you get the manual book so adam received that manual book from god in the garden of eden and it had it has part that says you can eat from this tree but not from this tree that was the manual book he had amen but then he fulfilled the book because a preacher came there a scientific preacher and said what did god say and the woman said god said we can eat from this tree but not from this one and that scientist men say that that was the serpent not a snake if was not deceived by the snake we've got snakes here around amen he saw but he was deceived by an upright being even when it speaks it will tell us we are still going to read the beast the dragoon but referring to a man amen so when you forfeited that book the original holder or owner of the book because that book is called the title deed to eternal life our names are written in that book not in a church book amen that's why i don't go to a church because then god must worship there no actually the bible says for by one spirit are we baptized into the body into easy do you know what is church it's not something formed by men our satan is going to break that one because as i'm saying for me to start any church i must have the blood of god because it is the blood of god that started the church amen now if somebody starts a church without the blood of god that is human blood church satan will bless you to pieces all right brother don't ever take a direction without being directed [Applause] there's some wizard who can misdirect you that's why the wise men and women if you come and say why is amen god church for i will give you pestering shepherds now in the morning i was also a head boy in the morning it is the head boy already the shepherd who will drive the ship out oxen and so forth for the pastures what if he says he drives them out of the crawl and some stand and say hey um no a ship can look after itself no the best talent of a sheep it is that it can't look after itself [Applause] and it's a good talent when it can look after itself then there is a shepherd david was a shepherd and as the prophet of god says shepherds are suspicious should he see grass moving like this because he is a shepherd he will start to pick up his spear pick up his sword amen when we are told that some people have planned to do this and this in the church we quickly draw our thoughts we are shepherds looking after the sheep but a sheep would go without a shepherd is going astray [Music] they are known of being heroes when i was in malawi we were told and the pastor they brought us a disc on that uh he told us you know the messiah tribe even lions fear them now we watched it what they do they will come make a cycle around a lion that has devoured their sheep or whatever now then they start their song coming closer moving together the thing is the elders should move together amen so they come moving together just like that then when the the lion will start look around and the first thing the lion will see is the unity the first thing satan has to notice among us is the unique amen that is the first thing you carry a gun it's not a problem even if you are carrying a gun it's not a problem for the enemy but but if you come in one unit that's trouble sends a message to the enemy now this messiah tribe they come like that now they make sure none of them will drop out of that unity [Music] of that cycle do you know about the cycle of life when we are all together in one accord [Music] amen satan stands no chance there [Music] i've lent it there now a lion if you look around the same thing that there's danger here because these people look alike [Music] they are in one mood one heart one spirit one gospel one baptism one one love amen it makes such a mighty power [Applause] but should one drop out the lion goes after him brother don't drop out [Music] once you drop out the lion comes after you [Applause] because it can sense that now you are alone that's why amen joshua said stay in the middle of the road [Music] don't go to the right don't go to the left and the prophet say when he shows he he saw once one ship moving out dropping out of the airline he said go back he never said first pray dude that go to the mountain pray three times a day and they said step back [Applause] if you are iron amen you need to collect connected to the power [Music] once you unplug it it won't save the purpose if you say my hand doesn't work the first thing they plug it back don't you say you know these these days you know i don't feel like going to the service i don't feel they say plug back because you were not like this i'm saying the first thing you'll start to blame the people yeah how can i worship when this one gossip about me how can i worship when this one have you come to worship man or a gardener [Applause] i was told about the sister she she's no longer coming to church now she tells the sister yeah every time i ask the teacher i want to see the pastor he keeps me waiting and waiting and waiting i said in the first place she is not a worshiper uh is god has he come to worship god or the deacon or the pastor now if then she the complaint is that the pastor has done this to me and what has god done to you come on [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] into the rapture yeah there are things that we just uh i've learned this in bupay you just they don't allow you just to venture in but um getting into the rapture now you are listening here and i'm not saying we are going to read about the rapture i'm saying we are getting into the rupture [Applause] that's why we said who is this bill kisadega [Applause] amen and we came to where we know that who is this milky side we we can't keep on going with the questions who is this medicine who is this do you say this is who do you say this we must come to the conclusion which is the answer of who is this melchizedek [Applause] because if it is an answer there must be is a question there must be an answer [Applause] a question without an answer becomes a ghost and it will keep on haunting you i'm glad this morning that who is this melchizedek i know who is this man kissing them [Applause] because these questions end then if there is a question there must be an answer the lord said who do men say that at the son of man em [Applause] it's a question and when all was quiet suddenly peter says thou art the christ son of the living god and the lord jesus said and the lord jesus said peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you brother do you know who is melchizedek flesh and blood has not revealed that to you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you know what is the seventh season flesh and blood has not revealed that to you [Applause] flesh and blood is also struggling to know who is this melchizedek [Applause] so i don't expect the answer from flesh and blood [Applause] flesh should the answer should come from him not from flesh and blood conflation blood will say i think amen holy chamom [Music] i was travelling in a train now there were some two young men took in there one very known to me i knew that he's referring to me because he knows me now but he's talking to this one you know in the train sitting like this i'm facing them we greeted one another hello but after that it was time now for him to scroll to me and say things and so forth yeah and then hey whatever would give me someone more about you amen now i'm closing with this we haven't preached about it now i was introducing to you one says them that are asleep and one other one says we which are alive we are going to get into that and look into that there's that those brother but i can show something here in closing here where how you operate this thing like this now we have this here are you together now we that are alive it's this side now we have here them that are asleep now we are going to dwell on that all this that you see here we're going to touch them coming down like this one let me just give you a glimpse of things we are going to look at where is that book here page triple one then i finish this one we close the service by god's grace we are going to prepare for ourselves to come to the service it says there was a time and that is cod that the people didn't go into the presence of god when they died they justified that was in the old testament they went into a place called paradise and then the source of the just waited in paradise but paradise was a place where god kept the souls in like a dreamland until the blood of jesus christ was shed for the blood of the bulls and goes would not take away sin it only covered up sin by jesus blood takes away sin so the old testament blood could not take away sin but could only cover but the new testament blood do not cover but it takes away sin are you there so you notice he died at calvary now those those uh all right and on his return he brought out from the grave those dead saints but you should know that the saints are actually not in the grave by their bodies you see because the resurrection the stages of it it says the lord said father received my spirit then peter as we are coming to read it peter says when he died his soul went to the uttermost the spirit to the father the body to the grave amen now you are going to see here when he went down now when they were celebrating his death that's when he was down there preaching preaching to the souls down there because during that time when he was preaching there it says that because you see the judgment hasn't yet come it is coming and there is no banning hell now because satan is there it's not benign it will bend when at the time of judgment [Music] then the hell will start to burn the fire will be so strong even those operating under will come running the fire will start down there as the prophet of god says a fire that will even bend water and peter saint peter apostle peter speaks of it we will read it that fire amen don't compare that fire with this fire here amen the fire here will only bend the body and immediately the soul will leave the body but that fire will benefit the soul [Applause] amen that is the fire of god that's why he pointed the judas inside my wood unto you because when he died he died a terrible death and going down the bottomless pit the queens of this seas they are going to go down the bottomless pit it is darkness burning darkness thick darkness going down without touching down bottomless bottomless means you can be rolling for ages without touching my who unto them the bible says so amen that's right you know now amen [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] where will you be [Music]
