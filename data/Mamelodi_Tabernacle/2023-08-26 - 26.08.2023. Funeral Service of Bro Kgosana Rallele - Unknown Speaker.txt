conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ we shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself may the Lord bless you another scripture Romans chapter 8 chapter 8 this 18-23 Romans chapter 8 from Verse 18 to 23 for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with that Glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the Creator itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation grownness and surveillance in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body you may be seated God bless you like [Music] uh this is the man I have known the young men um and that today we are we are here to bury foreign time Jesus came to the funeral of Lazarus because we are in a journey all of us did you know that the bodies we have put on uh the Redemption of our body that is why the Bible is talking about topology spiritually we are redeemed but we are still waiting for the Redemption of our bodies okay I mean you are redeemed that we are still in the body of motor [Music] and waiting for your true body I was saying there was a young man who came to to me um change foreign [Music] you know you the people in mamelodi no this is it is like a person who's going to he was talking like a person foreign then driving past a scrap yard or not discouraged agree ing because this is also coming there foreign I remember let me repeat this to you I was with a brother a brother and take us and now so they were they were showing us the coffins now the sixth lady gamola hello the brother introduced me to the sales lady she said oh okay come let let me show you the best coffins then you can choose one for your pasta now he said the best so we followed yeah to the other the other side of um she said then you can choose your password just from these ones I was laughing the body our bodies oh the best coffee whether they bury me yeah foreign we wish but all that is we say we are pilgrims on this Earth all right I mean now everything is just but tempura and that's why if you go to the graveyard is more with the stone there I guess where they always put the history of somebody I've never seen one I say because reading that he was a rich man who or he was a poor man and then I realized foreign uh you know in that Bible it says our citizenship Arena in heaven but now let me let us just drive a bed I want to look at the funeral attended by the Lord Jesus Christ we will know that Jesus Christ being our life amen amen I'm going to read this scripture the way to the funeral of Lazarus now if you look into your Bible Jesus has never attended any funeral Jesus because he is the resurrection now Resurrection cannot attend a funeral that's why when he arrived because my time is just here when he met Martha on his way not to the funeral but to the resurrection you remember a damselves and when Jesus was told of Dutch 11. [Music] uh the Lord Jesus was told about the death of lazarusa and it says when Jesus hated that yeah that Lazarus was sick he said ah his this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God foreign God can do things that will leave us wondering foreign because every time somebody is sick we think of death amen amen now let's look at it now he arrived at Master oh at the place where Martha dwells then Martha Bello Marta I'll start here then Mata as soon as she hit that Jesus was coming this is John 11 20. go John 11 verse 20. went and met you but Mary said still in the house um then set Martha unto Jesus Lord Moran if thou has been here my brother she was trying to console Jesus but I know that you can see now whatsoever ask of God God will give it to thee um Jesus said unto him my brother rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last days she was also giving out what she knew foreign I am the resurrection he never said all right let us discuss this you are talking to the resurrection I mean I mean and I am the resurrection amen amen and whosoever lives or a pillar and Believes In Me shall never die she said unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God you should come into the world she arose quickly and came unto him away now Jesus was not yet in the town on his way foreign amen amen that was the route to the tomb to lazarusa now you know one thing Masa didn't understand if Jesus says I am the resurrection he didn't say I have them and yeah Martha Marta thought she was talking to a mere man she didn't know that she was talking to the resurrection and the resurrection cannot attend anything do you know that yeah when they come together they can't come together when Jesus comes he is the resurrection and that's why he says now it took Mata a very long time then Jesus then the Jews which were with her in the house Jesus arrived there it's yes she was well comforted when they saw Mary that she rose up and went uh out followed her saying she goes unto the grace and then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet if that was being here amen he reversed the whole thing if only if foreign now he died because when Jesus therefore saw him and he said and the Jews also weeping which came in with her he groomed in the spirit and was troubled and said where have he laid him I really made a guy and yet Jesus knew where he was they said unto him Lord come and see he followed them just like amen Jesus also wept TJ so Leonardo he wept and not that Lazarus is dead no because he looked at the people was gifted to see the people crying all right I mean that was the resurrection that was the Redemption then that's why we thank God today he took the form of man foreign but she died for us it was not an accident when Jesus died that's why he said father forgive them he has plenty yeah now we plan his death commanded by him he has planned that his death the Lord Jesus because as a redeemer it is only by his blood yes we can be redeemed it takes blood not not a prayer that's why he is called the King's Men yes I mean and then so we were saved everybody meaning that uh we are part of him after the fall of Adam then he played with a plan he came with the Plan of Redemption is to take something back together okay then lastly let's arrive here again foreign this man which opened the eyes of the blind of course that have have caused that even this men should not have died again groaning in himself it was a cave the Bible this Bible says it was a cave and a stone lay upon it is [Music] you know uh he gave back to the man what belonged to the man where have you ladies foreign amen amen Martha the sister of him that was dead you know they had some sprays and all that never displayed they were lecture in Jesus for he has been dead four days we then Jesus said yes sir I said I not unto thee that if thou would have believed thou should I should have seen the glory of God Jesus then they took away the stone and Jesus the Lord Jesus because he said he said to the disciples Lazarus is dead foreign he didn't say let us go to his funeral because he is the resurrection he can't attend again okay I mean let us go unto Aryan Korean all right I mean to Jesus was alive because Lazarus was in Jesus when he was coming to the uh we call it Grace he came with the soulless now that's why have you ladies that is talking about the body of Lazada not Lazarus because Lazarus is yeah did you know that yeah and then he says or take you he's giving it to them take ye away mother the sister said hey Morella Lord this time about four days it's already now Jesus said unto him in closing now are not unto thee that if thou who just believe thou should say the glory of God then they took away the stool from the place because already in this body it is like I am buried because this body is the body of the ground the ground of us or the Earth this body now in this body I am a visitor as Paul says we all of us we are visitors is that right okay now let me finish this agency Jesus said yes said I not unto thee that if thou death belief and they took away their store from the place where she where the dead was laid Jesus lifted up his eyes yes and said father I thank you and I knew that thing and I knew that our that they may believe foreign and the dead shall hear this voice because he will come for those who are alive and that we know that either we meet him in the sky we will meet him even if I can die now but when he arrives now this is what I believe that believe that we should believe that he is not hey this word death who was given to men okay amen not to men but to the body of I was [Music] okay I mean now that's why we shall put on immortality if you as I said one time that every time you go for when a child is born they make some predictions she is no longer enjoying that time of that type of ministry he also before when he was born relations were made we wish but those that time is he is old autophage and this one is born it's just like that in this world when this one is born this this other one is ready to go he can't take it any longer now I was just saying let us believe him and you know Comfort one another qualifies now if it is the body of the world of us the world shall pass away now this body shall pass but we have another board amen amen not like this one is not the bleeding yes [Music] that is the body we're going to how many people is he doesn't take tablets it's Eternal workouts are feeling this body is not Italian but the person where we are today we going to bury the body not the brother yes okay I mean you can't bury a song yeah I mean you can't bury myself and the Earth shall

knowing whether tomorrow I will still be around Christian is somebody who is waiting this world is we are just passing through renewable feet foreign all right I mean but in this body we are suffering
