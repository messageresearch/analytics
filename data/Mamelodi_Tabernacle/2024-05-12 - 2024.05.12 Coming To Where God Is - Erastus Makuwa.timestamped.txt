[1:00:01] to me and Jesus answering said unto him
[1:00:05] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[1:00:09] becometh unto
[1:00:11] us to fulfill all
[1:00:13] righteousness then he suffered him and
[1:00:16] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:00:20] straightway out of the water and lo the
[1:00:23] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[1:00:26] the spirit of God descending like a dve
[1:00:29] and lightning upon him and L a
[1:00:34] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[1:00:38] beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:00:41] pleased let's read the last one
[1:00:45] chapter the last one while standing
[1:00:48] chapter
[1:00:50] 10 reel 10 ver 1-4
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:01:05] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:01:08] from heaven cloth with a cloud and a
[1:01:11] rain bow was upon his head and his face
[1:01:14] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:01:18] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:01:21] little book open and he set his right
[1:01:24] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[1:01:27] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[1:01:31] when a lion Roth and when he had cried
[1:01:34] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[1:01:37] when the seven Thunders had uttered
[1:01:39] their voices I was about to ride and I
[1:01:42] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:01:45] seal up those things which the seven
[1:01:47] Thunders uttered and write them not
[1:01:50] let's close our eyes as we
[1:01:54] pray what Heavenly Father thank you
[1:01:57] for this
[1:01:59] privilege you have privileged me with my

[1:02:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray
[1:02:28] amen you may take your
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:36] seat at the topic I'm going to speak
[1:02:43] about um before I go to that
[1:02:48] topic let me read a quote
[1:02:52] here in the book of Hebrews
[1:02:56] Hebrews
[1:02:57] chapter page 20
[1:03:00] 992 page 92 paragraph 28 paragraph 28 it
[1:03:08] says
[1:03:09] here there is something about where you
[1:03:16] go what church you go
[1:03:21] to and what teacher teaches you
[1:03:26] did you know
[1:03:28] it he's got something to
[1:03:31] eat therefore we ought to seek out the
[1:03:34] very
[1:03:38] best that we can
[1:03:41] find so we are getting the
[1:03:45] best we are getting the best we are
[1:03:49] getting the
[1:03:53] best was saying we are getting the
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:04:01] I believe perhaps you also you are
[1:04:04] getting the
[1:04:09] best not because it is
[1:04:14] sociable it is because it is not because
[1:04:17] it is
[1:04:20] sociable or so
[1:04:22] forth but the real
[1:04:26] Bible
[1:04:29] teaching in other words we are getting
[1:04:32] the real Bible
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:39] teaching um my topic is going to be
[1:04:43] coming to where God
[1:04:50] is I'm going to try to
[1:04:54] teach I'm not the
[1:04:58] but uh that's why I read the quote
[1:05:01] here is because our pastor here is the
[1:05:05] best
[1:05:10] teacher and I am his
[1:05:14] student and we have got brother is also
[1:05:18] the best
[1:05:22] teacher I am their student
[1:05:28] then um
[1:05:34] teaching it it convicted The
[1:05:43] Sinner and brings the sinner under
[1:05:51] condemnation but he says
[1:05:53] teaching brings his
[1:05:57] a person
[1:06:02] positionally when Jesus was commanding
[1:06:05] his
[1:06:08] disciples he said go and preach the
[1:06:12] gospel to Every
[1:06:17] Creature but and baptized
[1:06:20] them and those who believe bapti
[1:06:24] them and when those who were
[1:06:27] baptized they will be
[1:06:30] saved and after
[1:06:32] that you must teach
[1:06:35] them in other words it must be
[1:06:39] preaching and
[1:06:42] teaching it it mustn't be teaching and
[1:06:47] preaching it must be preaching and
[1:06:53] teaching because you cannot
[1:06:57] preach if people have
[1:07:01] come they've ran away from their
[1:07:08] places now they are
[1:07:11] here they must be
[1:07:14] placed
[1:07:17] positionally then you cannot preach to
[1:07:19] the people who have
[1:07:23] come you must teach them
[1:07:27] so that they can find their
[1:07:32] position that's why the prophet
[1:07:35] said an
[1:07:37] evangelist must never be a
[1:07:43] pastor because he is an
[1:07:48] evangelist the prophet says is a rolling
[1:07:52] ball of Fire
[1:07:59] is
[1:08:03] destroy then if you can bring an
[1:08:05] evangelist in the formal
[1:08:10] church he will drive the people out of
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:16] church but when the people have
[1:08:20] come they are waiting for you to teach
[1:08:24] them
[1:08:28] to show them their
[1:08:30] position when people were taken out of
[1:08:36] Egypt there was a
[1:08:38] message of taking them
[1:08:41] out and when they are in the
[1:08:44] wilderness there was another
[1:08:47] message in the
[1:08:49] wilderness because the first one it was
[1:08:53] saying come out
[1:08:56] the one in the
[1:08:57] wilderness it must say let's go
[1:09:02] forward it mustn't say come out where
[1:09:07] now it must say let's go
[1:09:11] forward then when they are about to
[1:09:16] enter they must it must say let's
[1:09:20] enter and when they have
[1:09:23] entered now they must they must be given
[1:09:27] their
[1:09:30] places you can't say you can't say to
[1:09:32] them come
[1:09:42] outen let's go
[1:09:46] brother come to where God
[1:09:51] is you cannot come to where God is
[1:09:56] if you don't know where he
[1:10:03] is and you must know what he
[1:10:13] is you must know what he
[1:10:17] is and you must know who he
[1:10:21] is are you together with then you can
[1:10:25] not go to
[1:10:27] somebody if you know where he
[1:10:30] is but if you don't know what he
[1:10:34] is you'll go to that
[1:10:37] place find him but because you don't
[1:10:41] know what is
[1:10:45] he what is
[1:10:47] he then you will never
[1:10:51] know but you'll be at the right place
[1:10:56] but you fail to find
[1:10:58] him there was a certain Young Rich
[1:11:03] Man Who
[1:11:05] rushed wanted to have eternal
[1:11:08] life he went straight to eternal
[1:11:12] life but because he don't know what
[1:11:14] eternal life
[1:11:17] was he came there where the eternal life
[1:11:22] was he came to that place
[1:11:26] life for
[1:11:27] was but he failed to get
[1:11:30] it because he he he didn't know what
[1:11:33] eternal life
[1:11:36] is but he wanted eternal
[1:11:39] life you must know what he
[1:11:45] is and who he
[1:11:50] is and if you are brought by
[1:11:53] somebody that person also must know
[1:11:57] where he
[1:12:00] is so that he can before he can take you
[1:12:03] to
[1:12:06] him in the
[1:12:09] beginning I'm going to read something
[1:12:11] for you
[1:12:15] here to to know who God
[1:12:20] is and where he is
[1:12:25] because we must know
[1:12:28] that you cannot worship
[1:12:32] God if you don't know
[1:12:38] him let me before we go any
[1:12:42] further go
[1:12:44] back
[1:12:48] genesis6 I will pick it up on I will
[1:12:52] pick it up Wednesday
[1:12:56] when God made
[1:12:57] man before he made man he called himself
[1:13:02] L
[1:13:06] El the word means in
[1:13:11] Hebrew men men self
[1:13:18] existence all by
[1:13:22] himself nothing existed before him
[1:13:27] he was old existence there ever
[1:13:32] was self existent
[1:13:37] one
[1:13:39] Elohim means the all sufficient all
[1:13:43] powerful
[1:13:47] Almighty self existent
[1:13:53] one then
[1:13:57] God was
[1:14:02] Elohim before the
[1:14:05] beginning and he
[1:14:07] said but in Genesis
[1:14:10] 2 when he made
[1:14:12] men he said now I am
[1:14:17] Jehovah I read in the middle of the
[1:14:20] paragraph Jehovah means the one who
[1:14:23] exist with his
[1:14:29] before he had
[1:14:31] family he was
[1:14:35] Elohim then then he had a
[1:14:38] family when he had a family that
[1:14:43] was male and
[1:14:46] female Adam and
[1:14:48] Eve it was called
[1:14:51] family then he was called Jehovah
[1:14:55] because Jehovah means the one who exist
[1:14:58] with his
[1:15:00] family he wasn't he wasn't Jehovah
[1:15:04] there he was
[1:15:06] Elohim but when he had
[1:15:09] family then he was called
[1:15:11] Jehovah are you together with
[1:15:14] me then
[1:15:18] there in in Exodus 6:3 Exodus 6
[1:15:26] when he appeared to
[1:15:30] Moses he said to
[1:15:33] Moses I am
[1:15:36] Jehovah and I was not known by this name
[1:15:43] before I am
[1:15:45] Jehovah why why he called he tells Moses
[1:15:50] he is
[1:15:52] Jehovah because now Israel
[1:15:56] was his
[1:15:59] family then he was the pillar of
[1:16:03] fire because he appeared to
[1:16:07] Moses as the pillar
[1:16:09] of that Pillar of Fire was
[1:16:14] God when Moses was where the pillar of
[1:16:17] fire
[1:16:19] was he was where God
[1:16:23] was are you
[1:16:26] together means the pillar of fire was
[1:16:31] Jehovah because he said I am
[1:16:35] Jehovah and this name I was not known by
[1:16:38] it
[1:16:40] before you read it in in Exodus
[1:16:47] 6:3 63 then he told
[1:16:50] Moses
[1:16:52] Moses now I don't want to be above
[1:16:56] you I don't want to be above you
[1:17:00] isra because he was above
[1:17:04] them leading them as the pillar of fire
[1:17:08] during the
[1:17:10] night but during the day there was the
[1:17:13] pillar of cloud then he said to Moses I
[1:17:17] want to dwell among
[1:17:19] you then make me a
[1:17:22] place where I can dwell
[1:17:26] then Moses buil
[1:17:28] a in using the
[1:17:32] plan he go on the
[1:17:35] mountain then he he made that
[1:17:38] Tabernacle after he had made the
[1:17:40] Tabernacle when he was dedicating the
[1:17:44] tabern that pillar of
[1:17:46] cloud came down into
[1:17:50] that it was Jehovah am them
[1:17:57] and if you want to know where God
[1:17:59] is you must go to the
[1:18:02] Tabernacle the children of
[1:18:05] Israel they were sure that their God was
[1:18:10] there my pastor told
[1:18:13] me that it was a it was a
[1:18:17] revelation to the
[1:18:19] israelit to know that their God was
[1:18:22] behind those B
[1:18:27] then one
[1:18:29] day after David has built his own
[1:18:34] house when he was in his beautiful
[1:18:38] house he looked
[1:18:40] at he said I can't live in a beautiful
[1:18:45] house and my God lived in that tent
[1:18:50] there I must build my God a beautiful
[1:18:54] house
[1:18:56] a beautiful house more than my
[1:19:00] house then he go
[1:19:02] toan was a
[1:19:05] prophet he said
[1:19:06] to I want to build a place for my
[1:19:13] God then said you had a good
[1:19:19] Revelation let give me time then when
[1:19:23] pray
[1:19:24] then God told
[1:19:27] Nan tell my son my son
[1:19:31] David that he is not the one who will
[1:19:34] build me a
[1:19:37] temple his
[1:19:39] son will build me a
[1:19:43] temple David had two
[1:19:46] sons he had two
[1:19:49] sons yet Solomon was his son
[1:19:55] Jesus was his son Jesus was his
[1:19:58] son Solomon was his natural
[1:20:02] son and Jesus was his spiritual
[1:20:07] son when he says your
[1:20:10] son he was talking about the
[1:20:14] two Solomon's natural
[1:20:17] son David's
[1:20:22] sonon bu the temple
[1:20:25] but what when God was saying
[1:20:28] that he was talking about
[1:20:31] this David
[1:20:35] spiritual that he will build him a
[1:20:40] temp but even
[1:20:42] though even though Solomon buil a
[1:20:49] temple let me say this my precious
[1:20:51] brothers and sisters
[1:20:55] he lived in the
[1:20:57] Tabernacle Our
[1:21:00] God a tabernacle was a place when they
[1:21:03] were
[1:21:07] moving God was in
[1:21:10] there and when when he moved out of the
[1:21:14] tle they were sure that they had to move
[1:21:20] here and when he
[1:21:22] settled they know we must
[1:21:26] here we are
[1:21:28] here in our
[1:21:33] Tabernacles we are in our
[1:21:35] T this
[1:21:38] our is because we are on a
[1:21:42] journey when Israel reached the promised
[1:21:46] land is where Solomon buil a
[1:21:50] temple in the promised
[1:21:53] land we have Promise
[1:21:56] Land then our houses
[1:21:59] there David Jesus promised us in the
[1:22:04] Book of John he said I'm going to build
[1:22:08] your
[1:22:09] house in my father's
[1:22:12] house there are many
[1:22:15] mansions and we know we know when he
[1:22:17] said in my father's
[1:22:19] house he me in his in his father's
[1:22:22] family
[1:22:25] he said there are many
[1:22:26] mansions when he talks about the
[1:22:28] Mansions there he was talking about our
[1:22:34] bodies they are there he said I'm going
[1:22:37] to
[1:22:38] prepare then I must so that so that when
[1:22:43] where I
[1:22:44] am you should be
[1:22:47] there this is
[1:22:50] our because we are on our journey
[1:22:55] then we have got temples there we have
[1:22:58] got houses
[1:22:59] there as Paul
[1:23:01] said when this edly Tabernacle
[1:23:06] dissolve we have
[1:23:10] houses built by
[1:23:12] God this one is here by
[1:23:16] birth is born by
[1:23:19] sin shaped in
[1:23:22] iniquity coming to the speak
[1:23:26] Li you cannot perfect this
[1:23:32] one
[1:23:36] a then after Solomon has built the
[1:23:41] tle in the promised
[1:23:45] land then the children of
[1:23:48] Israel they were sure that their was in
[1:23:53] that on the day of
[1:23:57] dedication that Pillar of Fire came in
[1:24:00] that in that
[1:24:01] Temple their God was
[1:24:04] there he was there
[1:24:09] accessed by the high
[1:24:13] Prest
[1:24:15] once
[1:24:18] year
[1:24:19] here Moses told them if they want to do
[1:24:24] a
[1:24:25] service if they want to do go
[1:24:28] service they must go to
[1:24:31] that that is where God will receive the
[1:24:35] services he said you must not do go
[1:24:38] service at any
[1:24:42] place you must go where
[1:24:45] is even now if you want to
[1:24:48] Worship You must go where God
[1:24:52] is God God is Not
[1:24:57] everywhere he is worship where he
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:04] is but you must
[1:25:07] know he always has a
[1:25:11] place where if you want to worship
[1:25:14] Him you must go there even now he has
[1:25:19] got a
[1:25:23] place he said I don't dwell in the place
[1:25:27] built by by
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:32] men but just
[1:25:35] place we must know the
[1:25:39] place isra knew that
[1:25:42] place that's why when he was in the
[1:25:45] temple even even if they were in the
[1:25:48] Exiles
[1:25:50] there when they want to worship and pray
[1:25:54] they would they would look towards
[1:25:58] Jerusalem they would look towards the
[1:25:59] temple
[1:26:01] Jerusalem when they when they looking
[1:26:04] towards
[1:26:05] there would listen to
[1:26:07] them you know how David you know how
[1:26:12] Daniel were
[1:26:14] worshiping he would he made a a window
[1:26:17] towards
[1:26:20] Jerusalem so that when he worship he
[1:26:23] must worship looking towards that
[1:26:26] window towards
[1:26:28] Jerusalem and he knew his God to receive
[1:26:31] his
[1:26:33] worship because he is there in the
[1:26:35] temple
[1:26:40] Jerusalem what about
[1:26:43] us when they were still
[1:26:47] worshiping God in the
[1:26:50] temple worshiping him praising him
[1:26:54] a vision
[1:26:57] conceived prophets after
[1:27:00] Prophet they were
[1:27:03] prophesying that there is God
[1:27:06] coming there is God coming there is God
[1:27:09] coming until a
[1:27:12] prophet the last one
[1:27:16] saying I'm going to send my
[1:27:20] messenger before my
[1:27:22] face you will prepare
[1:27:24] my my
[1:27:26] way because the Lord you are looking
[1:27:30] for will come to his
[1:27:33] Temple that was malter
[1:27:36] 3 he was talking about God coming into
[1:27:39] his
[1:27:41] Temple but they were worshiping at the
[1:27:45] temple thinking that he is
[1:27:48] there but this prophet he says is coming
[1:27:51] to the temple
[1:27:55] they thought perhaps they thought it
[1:27:57] will be
[1:28:01] recom but while they were
[1:28:04] worshiping the vision
[1:28:10] con when the vision
[1:28:13] conceived they were still
[1:28:17] worshiping
[1:28:18] praying in the temple but the vision con
[1:28:26] when he was with them in the
[1:28:28] temple when they were
[1:28:31] Jehovah Our
[1:28:34] God he was just laughing in his
[1:28:37] heart the god they
[1:28:39] worshiping is in
[1:28:43] me she was the only
[1:28:46] one who had that
[1:28:49] secret even now in our age there is a
[1:28:55] vision who is
[1:28:59] pregnated with
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:03] him and that vision is the only
[1:29:08] one he is climbing
[1:29:11] texes with people he went to shops with
[1:29:16] people he St with them he has got
[1:29:20] families he's the only one who knows
[1:29:30] the she is the only
[1:29:34] one before the vision could
[1:29:38] conceive she met the
[1:29:42] angel even this the vision I'm talking

[1:31:31] water to
[1:31:33] him who

[1:31:49] cousins by
[1:31:51] flesh Mary and Elizabeth were
[1:31:57] their eyes met one
[1:32:00] another there was there was God and His

[1:32:28] God one of those men there was a prophet
[1:32:33] one of those men there was his God was
[1:32:37] the god of
[1:32:43] another he

[1:32:48] said I have need to be baptized of Thee
[1:32:54] why Come Thou to
[1:32:55] me Jesus said suffer it to be now
[1:33:01] so but
[1:33:03] remember thus it behooves us to fulfill
[1:33:06] all
[1:33:11] righteousness why did John do
[1:33:14] it because he was the
[1:33:18] sacrifice the man who was before John
[1:33:24] he was the
[1:33:25] sacrifice John was a
[1:33:28] prophet he knew that the sacrifice has
[1:33:31] got to be
[1:33:34] washed before it can be
[1:33:37] presented oh yes and he suffered

[1:33:58] said this is my beloved
[1:34:02] Son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:34:06] dwell King
[1:34:07] James it put it like
[1:34:11] this in whom I am pleased to
[1:34:15] dwell so it's just any way you want to
[1:34:18] turn it
[1:34:21] around in
[1:34:24] or or or I am pleased to
[1:34:30] dwell it depends in what way you want to
[1:34:34] put then our Prophet
[1:34:37] say the God
[1:34:40] himself this is my beloved
[1:34:43] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:34:48] in God and
[1:34:51] men becoming one
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:57] day it was God and men becoming
[1:35:04] one it was the manifestation or
[1:35:07] fulfillment of Mali chapter
[1:35:11] 3 on that
[1:35:14] day man and God becoming
[1:35:20] one God moving into another
[1:35:27] Temple can you FL something there if you
[1:35:35] can if you can flesh
[1:35:45] it there it
[1:35:48] is I don't have a point
[1:35:52] here but
[1:35:56] I've already passed
[1:35:58] there this thing you
[1:36:01] know it's just a it's just a
[1:36:06] revision of what you already
[1:36:11] know in
[1:36:13] Genesis one and
[1:36:18] one he
[1:36:20] says in the
[1:36:22] beginning let me read it for
[1:36:28] you you must not
[1:36:31] forget we are going to where God
[1:36:36] is because he's always
[1:36:40] there the problem is that people don't
[1:36:43] know where he
[1:36:46] is but they want to worship
[1:36:51] him in the beginning God created the
[1:36:53] heavens and the
[1:36:57] Earth the Earth was without form and
[1:37:04] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:37:07] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:37:10] upon the face of the
[1:37:15] waters God is a
[1:37:18] spirit the Bible says the spirit of God
[1:37:21] was moving
[1:37:25] upon the face of the
[1:37:27] waters and he said
[1:37:30] there that spirit that was moving
[1:37:33] there it
[1:37:37] was and the prophet calls
[1:37:39] it a fountain of seven
[1:37:44] colors in other words when you were
[1:37:46] looking on that fa the face of that
[1:37:50] daughter you were seeing a rainbow
[1:37:55] a rainbow has seven
[1:37:58] color it was moving upon the
[1:38:02] wat and then John
[1:38:06] 1: it says that in the
[1:38:11] beginning there was the word the word
[1:38:14] was with God and the Word was
[1:38:19] God then God spirit
[1:38:24] came
[1:38:25] down when he came down he be in other
[1:38:29] words those seven
[1:38:31] colors came
[1:38:33] together when those seven colors came
[1:38:38] together it
[1:38:39] formed a
[1:38:43] logos the
[1:38:45] weight that's what the Bible says in the
[1:38:50] beginning there was the weight
[1:38:53] and the word let me read it the word was
[1:38:55] with God and the way was
[1:38:59] God are you together with
[1:39:03] me in the beginning was the
[1:39:08] weight the weight was with
[1:39:11] God the we logos
[1:39:16] theop was with the
[1:39:21] spirit it was the spirit there
[1:39:24] before it can be the
[1:39:26] weight in other words all when all those
[1:39:29] seven colors came
[1:39:32] together it form the
[1:39:37] word and the
[1:39:40] word it it is called a
[1:39:45] theop
[1:39:46] logos then it is also
[1:39:49] called Christ the pillar of Fire Son of
[1:39:54] God angel of the
[1:39:57] cant all those things is the
[1:40:03] weight is
[1:40:05] God when when he came in a
[1:40:09] form where he could be
[1:40:12] seen because when he was the pillar of
[1:40:15] fire you could see the pillar
[1:40:18] of but when was the spirit you couldn't
[1:40:21] see anything
[1:40:24] are you together with me he was coming
[1:40:26] to a
[1:40:28] form where he could be
[1:40:31] seen then he was
[1:40:35] aop you could see there you could read
[1:40:39] those as Pages
[1:40:42] there it will tell you exactly like
[1:40:46] that that those seven
[1:40:48] colors came together then from that
[1:40:52] theop
[1:40:55] in below there I've written Spirit
[1:41:00] there then I going this
[1:41:03] way I've written
[1:41:06] thoughts in other words God from
[1:41:10] Spirit he came to be a
[1:41:14] theophany and from the
[1:41:16] theophany he became
[1:41:19] flesh in John 14 1 ver4 joh 1: say the
[1:41:25] we was made
[1:41:27] flesh in other words the theop became
[1:41:31] flesh in other words all those
[1:41:36] scholar it was only in one
[1:41:41] man which was
[1:41:45] Jesus when you see Jesus moving
[1:41:48] there all those
[1:41:50] Scholars it was in him
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:41:58] are you together with
[1:42:01] me and with the
[1:42:04] prophet and with my
[1:42:09] pastor
[1:42:11] amen and then it says there when he was
[1:42:17] Spirit we were
[1:42:20] Spirits we were we were in him
[1:42:24] as
[1:42:26] thoughts we were in him as
[1:42:30] thoughts Adam was the thought of God
[1:42:36] expressed you are the thought of God
[1:42:40] Express but the the was the thought of
[1:42:44] God
[1:42:47] expressed but we by passed our theop
[1:42:54] because when he become a
[1:42:56] theist we were
[1:42:58] theist but we bypass those
[1:43:02] theop then we to become
[1:43:04] flesh so that we can be
[1:43:09] tested are you together with us we move
[1:43:12] from
[1:43:14] thoughts to
[1:43:16] flesh but Jesus moved from
[1:43:21] Spirit from thoughts
[1:43:24] to
[1:43:25] theop from
[1:43:27] theop flesh because we were
[1:43:31] flesh so that he can move us
[1:43:35] back to carry us back to
[1:43:42] again because we
[1:43:46] them I was just passing
[1:43:50] there are you together with me but where
[1:43:54] where where where was I
[1:43:56] going I was going to
[1:44:00] where um
[1:44:03] Jesus was the place of
[1:44:08] God go he was the
[1:44:11] temple of
[1:44:13] God if you have got the seat in your
[1:44:17] hand you you know what the seat
[1:44:20] is if you have got the seat in your
[1:44:24] hand
[1:44:26] because Jesus says
[1:44:30] himself I am a
[1:44:34] corn a corn of
[1:44:39] wheat the word of God is a seat the
[1:44:43] Bible says
[1:44:45] so then if you have got a
[1:44:48] se you have got
[1:44:51] everything but is is
[1:44:53] one but in
[1:44:56] it there are
[1:44:58] Roots there are
[1:45:01] stems there are
[1:45:04] leaves there are
[1:45:07] flowers there are
[1:45:09] fruits there are other
[1:45:11] seats inside this
[1:45:15] seat but even if you can break it
[1:45:19] down if you can break it
[1:45:24] to look
[1:45:25] inside if you want to find the The Roots
[1:45:29] there you can't find them but they are
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:35] there amen but if you want to find those
[1:45:39] lives
[1:45:41] there you must put the
[1:45:45] seat in a in the in the in the good
[1:45:51] soil in the
[1:45:55] condition then now you will see the stem
[1:45:58] you will see the
[1:46:00] roots then you see the
[1:46:03] stem then you see
[1:46:06] leaves then you see
[1:46:08] flowers coming from the something you
[1:46:11] have placed in the
[1:46:14] soil but that thing must rot
[1:46:18] first the seat you have placed
[1:46:21] there it must
[1:46:23] Ro in order to bring something
[1:46:29] up all right are you with us here let me
[1:46:35] read something here for
[1:46:37] you in this book
[1:46:40] here I just want to go back a little
[1:46:43] read it for
[1:46:44] you so that you can hear is the prophet
[1:46:47] who says
[1:46:50] those now here is what happened
[1:46:55] this gets me right where I love
[1:46:58] it see the logos this great
[1:47:04] Fountain this great Fountain of
[1:47:07] spirit which had no
[1:47:10] Beginning No End this great
[1:47:16] spirit begin to form in the creation
[1:47:23] logos that went out from
[1:47:27] it was the son of
[1:47:29] God it was the only visible
[1:47:35] form that the spirit
[1:47:38] had it was a
[1:47:40] theop which means a
[1:47:44] body the body was like a
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] man that was that that it it is the same
[1:47:54] type of a
[1:47:55] body that we receive when we die
[1:47:59] here if this early Tabernacle be
[1:48:04] dissolved we have for one already
[1:48:07] waiting that was
[1:48:10] it that was the
[1:48:12] theop that was the
[1:48:14] theop which was the Son of
[1:48:17] God the Sun the
[1:48:20] logos became flesh
[1:48:24] because we were put in
[1:48:26] flesh and in the theop the logos became
[1:48:32] flesh here Among
[1:48:34] Us it was nothing
[1:48:37] else but the dwelling
[1:48:40] place for that entire
[1:48:44] fountain dwelt in
[1:48:47] him there he
[1:48:49] is that was the one that is
[1:48:54] I just want to show
[1:48:55] you that it is the
[1:48:58] prophet who says the whole
[1:49:02] Fountain was in that
[1:49:05] man the whole Fountain came
[1:49:09] together and become the
[1:49:12] man then that man was a
[1:49:17] temple which was spoken by Malachi
[1:49:21] 3 was in
[1:49:25] him and
[1:49:27] people some could
[1:49:30] recognize that God was
[1:49:33] there but they didn't leave
[1:49:37] worshiping they went on
[1:49:40] praising they went on trying to
[1:49:43] worship but they were worshiping where
[1:49:46] God was not
[1:49:49] there even
[1:49:51] now people are still worshiping but
[1:49:54] they're worshiping where God is not
[1:49:57] there they think God is
[1:50:00] there they build their own
[1:50:03] denomination after building their own
[1:50:06] denin they give the denomination the
[1:50:09] name after giving the
[1:50:12] name they say our God is
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:18] here how how is he got in there
[1:50:24] because you have bu your own
[1:50:26] thing and you have called Your Own Thing
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:30] name but they say our God is here he is
[1:50:34] here with
[1:50:35] us then they worship he sing they do
[1:50:40] whatever they want to do they pray for
[1:50:42] the sick some of the sick get
[1:50:45] healed but God is Not There
[1:50:54] the prophet says we preach
[1:50:58] salvation as salvation is for
[1:51:02] all but we know that salvation is not
[1:51:06] for
[1:51:07] all but we preach
[1:51:12] it we preach
[1:51:14] healing as if healing is for
[1:51:17] all but we know that healing is not for
[1:51:21] all
[1:51:25] some people
[1:51:28] recognized that God is in this
[1:51:32] man just like Philip Philip recognized
[1:51:36] that God was
[1:51:38] there and he went to
[1:51:40] call to
[1:51:42] bring where God
[1:51:46] is if you don't know where God is you
[1:51:50] cannot bring somebody
[1:51:53] because you don't know where
[1:51:56] he if you have
[1:52:00] fire you have make it or you have you
[1:52:03] find it
[1:52:05] t and you find somebody who is getting
[1:52:10] cold who who is
[1:52:13] shering with
[1:52:16] coldness you must just took the
[1:52:19] man by the hand or that woman
[1:52:23] pull him to the
[1:52:25] fire where the fire
[1:52:28] is but you must not show him the picture
[1:52:31] of
[1:52:33] fire if you show him the picture of fire
[1:52:36] he will even
[1:52:41] die say
[1:52:43] Amen am but take the man with a
[1:52:48] hand lead him to the
[1:52:50] fire when he approached fire you'll see
[1:52:55] him raising his hand towards the fire
[1:52:59] you see him like this because he's the
[1:53:02] one who's feeling the heat
[1:53:04] now you'll never tell him turn turn
[1:53:08] around turn around this way now this
[1:53:12] way because he is at the right
[1:53:15] place see what happened to
[1:53:18] Philip when he brought Nathaniel there
[1:53:21] said
[1:53:23] the one the
[1:53:25] prophets in the
[1:53:27] law talked
[1:53:30] about I have found
[1:53:32] him is Jesus of
[1:53:34] nazare when he brought
[1:53:37] nael to the
[1:53:39] fire before Philip could say yeah this
[1:53:41] is the
[1:53:43] man Jesus spoke if you bring people to
[1:53:47] where Jesus is you bring people to where
[1:53:50] God is
[1:53:54] speak yes
[1:53:57] sir before Philip can say
[1:54:00] something God
[1:54:02] spoke said this is the
[1:54:05] Beloved a true servant of
[1:54:09] God how do you know me he said before
[1:54:14] Philip I saw you studying the Bible
[1:54:19] there answered
[1:54:24] the Son of
[1:54:29] God he
[1:54:30] knew who this man
[1:54:34] is because he came to where fire
[1:54:37] is Philip say say You must
[1:54:44] say he if you bring
[1:54:47] someone who is
[1:54:50] predestinated to a predestinate
[1:54:54] Place something in
[1:54:57] him will tell her or
[1:54:59] him who is this man he will say
[1:55:06] something you will never teach him how
[1:55:09] to
[1:55:11] pray you must always pray brother you
[1:55:14] must always read the
[1:55:19] Bible he
[1:55:20] himself will read the the Bible he
[1:55:23] himself will pray he himself will need
[1:55:28] God
[1:55:33] more because if you have brought a
[1:55:37] person where God
[1:55:40] is then he will get whatever he
[1:55:46] wants
[1:55:48] amen but only to where God is
[1:55:54] also Samaritan
[1:55:56] womanize that that God is there then he
[1:56:01] brought she brought people
[1:56:03] there and when they were
[1:56:05] there they also
[1:56:08] saw this is God is
[1:56:11] here this is
[1:56:13] God they said to
[1:56:15] him now we
[1:56:20] see he don't go on
[1:56:25] because
[1:56:25] now we
[1:56:28] ourselves we
[1:56:32] see we
[1:56:33] ourselves we can
[1:56:39] hear that these are people who have come
[1:56:42] to the
[1:56:45] place when that's
[1:56:48] it because he is the full
[1:56:53] he was he was all all things were in
[1:56:58] him when he was building his
[1:57:05] church which
[1:57:09] was the seven Church
[1:57:12] Ages which was which the the r
[1:57:17] the which the foundation
[1:57:20] thereof was Jewish
[1:57:25] the
[1:57:26] body was
[1:57:30] Gentiles and the roof
[1:57:35] thereof was Christ
[1:57:40] himself when he was building his
[1:57:44] church he unfolded
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:50] himself but me go back there on the day
[1:57:54] of
[1:57:56] P he unfold himself
[1:57:59] there came
[1:58:00] in as a
[1:58:03] of
[1:58:05] himself among
[1:58:08] them they
[1:58:10] were the
[1:58:12] places from one place to many
[1:58:18] places
[1:58:20] because when
[1:58:23] Saul was trying to persecute
[1:58:25] Christians when Saul was trying to
[1:58:27] persecute
[1:58:31] Christians Jesus himself
[1:58:33] said you are persecuting
[1:58:37] me because it was him in
[1:58:42] them if you persecute them you persecute
[1:58:47] him he was
[1:58:49] there even when Cornelius
[1:58:52] when he was looking for God he was
[1:58:56] worshiping loving God doing all things
