[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; If you can just commit this prayer
[1:08:10] request unto the Lord.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And also the offerings and the tidings.
[1:08:27] We are running short of ways to say
[1:08:30] thank you unto the Lord
[1:08:32] for the goodness that you are doing into
[1:08:35] our lives. Lord,
[1:08:41] when Jesus died on that cross,
[1:08:46] there was blood that scattered the gap.
[1:08:51] And that blood, it was the power
[1:08:55] where the Bible says we were healed
[1:08:58] through that blood from the foundation
[1:09:01] of the world.
[1:09:03] The same power
[1:09:05] it is the power gracious heavenly father
[1:09:08] that is in
[1:09:10] your bride this morning.
[1:09:14] There are so many requests that has been
[1:09:16] brought gracious Lord.
[1:09:20] But there is a healing power
[1:09:23] and that power gracious Lord will touch
[1:09:25] each and everyone.
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:28] And also for those Lord who
[1:09:32] never manage to bring their request but
[1:09:35] you know their hearts the very same
[1:09:38] healing power is touching each and
[1:09:41] everyone. Gracious Lord.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that Lord
[1:09:47] through the grace and through the power
[1:09:49] of the Lord, that is why we've got the
[1:09:52] thanksgiving.
[1:09:54] Because Lord, after healing your people,
[1:09:57] they will come and say thank you unto
[1:09:59] the almighty God because the God has
[1:10:02] done it for them. Even also this
[1:10:05] morning, Father, we pray that let no
[1:10:08] even a single one, gracious heavenly
[1:10:11] father, who definitely need your
[1:10:14] healing, need your power in the corner
[1:10:17] where you are, gracious heavenly father,
[1:10:20] let it work for them in the name of
[1:10:22] Jesus. Casting out every demonic power,
[1:10:26] casting out devils in the name of Jesus.
[1:10:29] You Satan, get out and never come back
[1:10:32] in the name of Jesus because the healing
[1:10:35] power of the Lord is controlling right
[1:10:37] now. Thank you heavenly father that they
[1:10:40] shall testify and say that the god the
[1:10:44] god the the god has made it for them
[1:10:47] again this morning. We give you the
[1:10:50] glory and we give you the honor for we
[1:10:52] are worthy to be praised not for
[1:10:54] coaching baba amat tithes and offering
[1:10:56] that has come through. We pray for them
[1:10:59] Lord and bless each and everyone in the
[1:11:02] name of our lord and savior Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ. Amen.
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; The band will just say something.
[1:11:19] While we display our thanksgivings,
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:12:42] Amen.

[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; These are the upcoming events.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; The next Saturday we have a wedding in
[1:15:33] Malawi.
[1:15:38] And on the 11th of August we have
[1:15:40] another wedding.
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:45] October. Oh,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; in smart school,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; we also shared a a link for for people
[1:15:59] to register.
[1:16:03] I trust you have all
[1:16:06] made the RSVP.
[1:16:12] Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; We also
[1:16:19] have our elderly
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; from Northwest.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sure many of you remember
[1:16:34] and
[1:16:36] is back in fellowship with us.
[1:16:41] Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Uh we have decided to display the photo
[1:16:49] because he's not feeling well.
[1:16:53] So at the moment he's in and out of the
[1:16:56] hospital also.
[1:17:00] So he wanted to be with us
[1:17:03] so that we can introduce him
[1:17:06] while he's present with us.
[1:17:10] So we asked him to send us the photo
[1:17:15] so that we can display to the church.
[1:17:19] May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:17:23] We also have a request
[1:17:28] that when
[1:17:31] we send prayer request and
[1:17:33] thanksgivings,
[1:17:38] if we can try to make them a little bit
[1:17:40] shorter
[1:17:45] so that we can save time,
[1:17:48] we also have a request for those that
[1:17:51] are rendering musical items.
[1:17:56] that they practice with the band.
[1:18:00] They can always li us with brother
[1:18:03] Kandis
[1:18:07] and he will assist them to practice with
[1:18:09] the band
[1:18:12] and also let us try to keep our items
[1:18:16] shorter
[1:18:20] so that we don't take the time for the
[1:18:22] preacher.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] And
[1:18:31] there is
[1:18:33] another request.
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:39] We may have created a wrong impression.
[1:18:46] And please forgive us.
[1:18:50] It was not our intention.
[1:18:54] I'm sure you remember when Pastor Magu
[1:18:56] was preaching
[1:19:02] indicated
[1:19:05] that he received a call from sister Das.
[1:19:11] So that was actually a request from the
[1:19:14] pastor
[1:19:17] that the sister called pastor
[1:19:22] to come and see him
[1:19:25] and to come and preach.
[1:19:28] So it was the pastor that actually
[1:19:30] requested pastor Magua to come and
[1:19:32] preach.
[1:19:36] So every time you see a minister
[1:19:39] standing on the pullpit
[1:19:43] It is always a request from the pastor.
[1:19:49] Sometimes when we are close,
[1:19:53] when we are close to the pastor,
[1:19:56] the pastor will ask us,
[1:19:59] can you call so and so to come and
[1:20:01] preach?
[1:20:04] Sometimes sometimes he will ask a
[1:20:08] can you call so to come and preach.
[1:20:12] And sometimes the pastor himself
[1:20:16] will pick up a phone and call.
[1:20:19] So it is the pastor that actually
[1:20:24] recommend a preacher for us.
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:30] Hallelujah.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we created the wrong
[1:20:36] impression,
[1:20:39] please forgive us.
[1:20:42] We are blessed in this church.
[1:20:45] We have our precious pastor,
[1:20:48] Pastor Israel.
[1:20:53] And he is our shepherd.
[1:20:56] Can we thank God for that?
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] Even this morning
[1:21:05] we are truly blessed.
[1:21:08] Our precious pastor
[1:21:11] has requested
[1:21:13] our elder.
[1:21:18] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you
[1:21:23] as we stand on our feet
[1:21:25] to welcome the word of God.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. with our special song.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; But in the days
[1:21:36] of the
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:50] be
[1:21:53] to
[1:21:56] make that
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:01] our
[1:22:04] should be finished.
[1:22:07] as he
[1:22:09] has declared
[1:22:12] to reset
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:21] you
[1:22:28] before
[1:22:34] and
[1:22:39] he
[1:22:41] shall
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:49] to their children.
[1:22:52] The heart
[1:22:54] of their children
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:18] will come.
[1:23:21] Holy
[1:23:24] [Applause]
[1:23:25] [Music]
[1:23:31] Ghost
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:38] with power.
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:50] Holy God,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; we
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; As I greet you this morning
[1:24:12] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:24:14] Christ.
[1:24:17] Amen. Amen. is the same yesterday,
[1:24:19] today, and forever.
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; I'm standing in the gap
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; because our pastor
[1:24:33] has requested me to stand on his behalf.
[1:24:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe I must apologize.
[1:24:46] You can sit for 5 seconds.
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; It just came to my heart
[1:25:00] that I must share this with you.
[1:25:04] The reason being
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; maybe many are wondering
[1:25:12] what is happening with our pastor
[1:25:15] because it's been sometimes
[1:25:17] not behind the pullpit.
[1:25:20] I I I want to read you a quote
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; from brother Brennham
[1:25:25] life story life story
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; because some of the things
[1:25:30] do happen in life
[1:25:33] and we do not understand
[1:25:36] we realize that things are in the hand
[1:25:39] of God.
[1:25:43] Uh
[1:25:45] I said it the other day
[1:25:48] go and read
[1:25:51] the spoken word called life story
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] life story
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; of brother Brenham the people of the old
[1:26:00] I know they've read it but read it again
[1:26:05] for understanding this time
[1:26:09] amen
[1:26:13] what we are going through in life
[1:26:17] brother went through
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; brotherham
[1:26:20] and he became our example.
[1:26:24] That's why it came to me
[1:26:26] that I must just read this this quote.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; I stayed so long in the platform
[1:26:40] and things until I had to take 8 months
[1:26:44] rest.
[1:26:48] I don't know how many of you
[1:26:51] knew that brother Brennham
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; did not preach for 8 months.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] I was off the field
[1:27:10] when they thought I would leave the
[1:27:12] world.
[1:27:16] You've heard the story of that.
[1:27:19] And while I was gone,
[1:27:22] why
[1:27:24] some of the other ministers
[1:27:27] that were following along be behind my
[1:27:30] ministry
[1:27:32] was going ahead.
[1:27:35] praying for the sick
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; and they were carrying articles and so
[1:27:40] forth.
[1:27:42] So the suggestion was made
[1:27:47] suggest
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; that we make it the inter evangelical
[1:27:50] paper
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; and just not have any
[1:27:56] representing anyone a certain man
[1:28:01] and that's the way I like to see things.
[1:28:07] I don't want things that look as to
[1:28:09] myself.
[1:28:12] I want it for the church of the living
[1:28:13] God,
[1:28:16] for everybody.
[1:28:18] Did you hear it?
[1:28:22] You know, Jacob dug three wells.
[1:28:28] The one well, they drove him away
[1:28:32] and he called it strife.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And the other one was a malice,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; I believe, or hatred.
[1:28:41] or something. He he said well
[1:28:46] and said there's a room for us all.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; So I think that's what what is what now?
[1:28:57] There's a room for us all.
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Many a times when the anointing strike
[1:29:08] me
[1:29:11] Just imagine going out
[1:29:13] into another world
[1:29:17] then coming back
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; then out then.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That was brother
[1:29:24] and after a while you get weak.
[1:29:29] After a while you don't know where you
[1:29:30] are.
[1:29:34] And when I go to walk,
[1:29:38] it's not because
[1:29:40] I'm too weak
[1:29:42] but I can't see where I'm walking.
[1:29:46] Then believe sometimes
[1:29:48] put arms around me,
[1:29:51] he he watches.
[1:29:53] If you will notice,
[1:29:56] he will stand over there in a corner
[1:29:59] somewhere and keep his eye on it.
[1:30:04] That's the reason I have him.
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; How many remembers when I was off for
[1:30:12] eight months
[1:30:17] because of poor management
[1:30:21] and so forth. Amen. Then brother Brenham
[1:30:24] continued saying
[1:30:26] the scripture teaches us that as well.
[1:30:30] He said, "Look at Elijah."
[1:30:33] After being under the vision up there
[1:30:37] and saw how to fix that bullock and
[1:30:40] everything,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; a bulock
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; for the sacrifice,
[1:30:48] called fire down out of heaven
[1:30:52] and rain out of heaven.
[1:30:55] The same day went out in the wilderness.
[1:31:01] was lost
[1:31:02] for 40 days and nights
[1:31:06] wandering around.
[1:31:09] God found him,
[1:31:11] pulled him back in the cave.
[1:31:14] Is that right? Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He heard the winds goes by
[1:31:19] and he heard noise goes by and then a
[1:31:22] small still voice said,
[1:31:25] "What are you look in there, Elijah?
[1:31:29] See the anointing left him and that's
[1:31:32] it.
[1:31:34] Last quote.
[1:31:37] Brother was in the service
[1:31:40] when he comes back after 8 months.
[1:31:44] He said
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; am I looking at Henry Croenry?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother Henry.
[1:31:53] I haven't seen you for a long time
[1:31:56] and brother. Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I just happened to look back
[1:32:02] seen dead and recognize him.
[1:32:06] Seen dead
[1:32:10] recognize him.
[1:32:13] The other day was not even recognizing
[1:32:15] his death.
[1:32:19] When I had my great breakdown,
[1:32:23] break down or come off the field
[1:32:29] about eight months.
[1:32:32] They were real brother
[1:32:35] and a daddy to me.
[1:32:38] They stayed right with me all the time.
[1:32:42] I never will forget the day
[1:32:46] that brother grow there
[1:32:49] we went out in the cornfield to pray.
[1:32:55] I was so nervous.
[1:32:58] I stayed in the vision so long
[1:33:02] I couldn't tell whether I was in or out.
[1:33:08] He put his arm around me.
[1:33:11] Just simple like said
[1:33:15] now

[1:33:44] you
[1:33:47] and set down by the evergreen trees
[1:33:51] where the fountains of waters of life
[1:33:55] is flowing from the throne.
[1:33:59] We will be in the presence of our papa
[1:34:01] God
[1:34:03] then forever and ever to live in his
[1:34:07] presence.
[1:34:09] Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you that
[1:34:13] all men of God has went through this.
[1:34:19] If you don't see our pastor this
[1:34:21] morning,
[1:34:22] don't worry. Just be like brother Cro
[1:34:27] put your arm
[1:34:28] around him and say Papa God
[1:34:32] make everything well.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I many of you did not know what
[1:34:40] brother went through
[1:34:43] but lucky we are this morning
[1:34:47] we know what he went through
[1:34:49] when he was not behind the pull pit
[1:34:53] he was talking with God
[1:34:56] brother
[1:34:58] after he came back to the pull pit
[1:35:02] the devil couldn't challenge him
[1:35:06] I just want to tell you This morning
[1:35:09] pastor is not behind the prophet today
[1:35:13] physically.
[1:35:14] He is coming.
[1:35:16] When he comes the devil will not
[1:35:19] challenge.
[1:35:23] I had an opportunity
[1:35:25] of being with him for three weeks.
[1:35:30] I saw him every day.
[1:35:32] It's the third week. It was the third
[1:35:34] week yesterday.
[1:35:37] I've seen that and I have a personal
[1:35:40] testimony
[1:35:41] that I want to share with you.
[1:35:44] The reason why I was with the pastor for
[1:35:46] 3 weeks
[1:35:49] is because I'm not working.
[1:35:51] This is the third month
[1:35:54] not working. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; So I went to see I explained to the
[1:36:00] board what happened.
[1:36:03] Then I said to the pastor, I'm not
[1:36:05] working. I'll be with you here.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Then he asked me what happened.
[1:36:14] I explained to him that we work in
[1:36:17] project
[1:36:19] and the project has duration.
[1:36:22] Now the duration
[1:36:24] has an ending. It came to an end. But
[1:36:28] they promise me that they will call me
[1:36:32] if there's another project.
[1:36:34] And I I stick to that.
[1:36:37] Every day. I'm saying every day. There
[1:36:41] was never a single day pastor did not
[1:36:44] ask me that question.
[1:36:47] Did they call you? I'll say no pastor.
[1:36:51] He
[1:36:52] closed their eyes.
[1:36:54] He said they will call you. I don't know
[1:36:57] he was tired or he was praying for me.
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:05] But he did that
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; for two weeks.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; On the third week, that was this week on
[1:37:16] Tuesday because even that Monday he
[1:37:18] asked me then in Tuesday on Tuesday he
[1:37:22] didn't ask me then my company
[1:37:27] you know we have a website where we see
[1:37:31] whether they are project or not.
[1:37:33] website.
[1:37:35] Then I look on the website, I find that
[1:37:39] there's a project in Second
[1:37:43] Skunda is not far from Wheatbank,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; but it's about 110 kilometers.
[1:37:50] To me, it's not far.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Then I phoned the head office. It was
[1:37:55] early in the morning around.
[1:37:59] I said I see a project in Sund
[1:38:03] why can't you take me there
[1:38:06] then they said to me no we are not
[1:38:09] taking you there we found someone I I
[1:38:12] was not happy to be honest I said this
[1:38:14] guy come Tuesday the very same Tuesday
[1:38:20] midday
[1:38:22] I I received a call from the head office
[1:38:26] they greeted me was the senior director
[1:38:30] Then I say I'm fine.
[1:38:32] They say agently send your document.
[1:38:37] We have a project for you.
[1:38:40] Amen. Amen. And I said to the pastor I
[1:38:45] need a project that is not far from
[1:38:47] home.
[1:38:49] Can be here in
[1:38:51] Oh yes. That's why I was very much
[1:38:54] worried about second.
[1:38:58] Then the pastor said, "No, you'll get
[1:39:00] the one that is for you
[1:39:03] nearer to your house. Don't worry."
[1:39:07] Then I asked this director of mine,
[1:39:11] "Where do you want to place me?"
[1:39:14] He said, "With bank."
[1:39:19] Amen.
[1:39:24] Then I asked him,
[1:39:27] "Am I dreaming or what?"
[1:39:36] So I was like, "I don't know how God
[1:39:39] does things."
[1:39:43] There's a power station called
[1:39:47] station.
[1:39:49] just 35 km from my house.
[1:39:53] So, I'll be working there.
[1:39:56] God bless you.
[1:39:59] I'm just
[1:40:01] strengthening you
[1:40:03] because God is a good God.
[1:40:07] Keep on holding on his everlasting arms
[1:40:11] as we stand to our feet.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song, our national
[1:40:17] anthem.
[1:40:19] and we will read the word of God.

[1:46:23] But incomplete.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; We forgot to we forgot to say
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; we have the seven seat.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Let's sing
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:48] now.
[1:46:51] Oh,
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:00] heat,
[1:47:14] heat.
[1:47:17] Heat.
[1:47:18] [Applause]
[1:47:25] Heat.
[1:47:35] Heat.
[1:47:38] Heat.
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:52] Heat
[1:48:00] up
[1:48:08] here.
[1:48:19] Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; As we open our Bible
[1:48:25] in the book of Isaiah chapter 65
[1:48:30] only verse 21.
[1:48:34] Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:48:39] them and they shall plant vineyards and
[1:48:42] eat the fruit of them.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:45] Let's go to the book of Revelation 20
[1:48:48] verse 1-3.
[1:49:02] And I saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:49:06] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:49:08] a great chain in his hand.
[1:49:11] And he laid hold on the dragon, that old
[1:49:14] serpent, which is the devil, and Satan,
[1:49:18] and bound him a thousand years, and cast
[1:49:21] him into the bottomless pit, and shut
[1:49:24] him up, and set a seal upon him, and he
[1:49:28] that he should deceive the nations no
[1:49:31] more, till the thousand years should be
[1:49:34] fulfilled, and after that he must be
[1:49:36] loosed a little season.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you for being patient.
[1:49:48] Let's start with our message of the day.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; We continue
[1:49:57] with our same title,
[1:49:59] the simultaneous appearance of our Lord
[1:50:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:50:06] Today we specifically look at the
[1:50:09] millennium.
[1:50:14] Millennium is a thousand years.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; So I we I was talking to brother harvest
[1:50:24] just behind here
[1:50:26] that I said we are in part four.
[1:50:31] He said part three.
[1:50:34] I I said this millennium.
[1:50:37] Previously we were speaking about the
[1:50:40] and then the go and make and then our
[1:50:43] bright age. Bright age.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So we agreed on that one.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; So
[1:50:52] there's a moment
[1:50:55] that we call the millennium.
[1:51:00] Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham. Brother was ask questions
[1:51:06] by people thinking that the millennium
[1:51:10] is eternity.
[1:51:12] Then brother said no millennium is not
[1:51:16] eternity
[1:51:18] eternity is in the new Jerusalem.
[1:51:23] Millennium is time.
[1:51:26] Yes. Amen. Then he spoke about
[1:51:30] the post millennium,
[1:51:33] the preliminary or the prelim millennium
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; and the no millennium.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he was trying to show the
[1:51:43] people that
[1:51:45] what happened before millennia,
[1:51:48] what is happening in the millennium,
[1:51:51] what will be happening after the
[1:51:52] millennium.
[1:51:55] For today we will talk about the
[1:51:58] millennium.
[1:52:01] Why the simultaneous you know?
[1:52:07] Well, in back then
[1:52:11] we were normally talking about the
[1:52:14] Israelites,
[1:52:16] the Samaritans
[1:52:18] and the Gentile. And the time goes by.
[1:52:22] So today
[1:52:24] we will talk about the bride, the
[1:52:28] foolish visions,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; the unbelievers
[1:52:34] and Israel.
[1:52:36] What will be happening
[1:52:38] for this people in the millennium
[1:52:44] only the millennium?
[1:52:46] Where will the bride be?
[1:52:48] Where will the foolish vision be?
[1:52:52] Where will the unbeliever be?
[1:52:55] Where will the Israelites be?
[1:52:59] Are we together? Amen. Now brother start
[1:53:03] teaching us about what happened in the
[1:53:06] garden of Eden
[1:53:09] that God has created this earth
[1:53:13] for six days
[1:53:16] for 6,000 days
[1:53:19] and then the seventh day
[1:53:22] he rest. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; So he said the seventh day
[1:53:27] was like a millennia.
[1:53:31] But none
[1:53:34] has completed
[1:53:37] thousand year in his life
[1:53:42] since human race began.
[1:53:46] No one has lived a thousand years.
[1:53:52] Adam
[1:53:53] lived 930 years.
[1:53:57] 98.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; You will find it in Genesis 5.
[1:54:01] Genesis 5th lived 969 years.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; You will find the same chapter verse 27
[1:54:12] 27. They couldn't reach a thousand
[1:54:15] years.
[1:54:18] And God has made a man to live a
[1:54:22] thousand years.
[1:54:25] Now a man fail.
[1:54:27] If a man fails, God cannot fail.
[1:54:32] He will fight
[1:54:34] back to restore a man to live a thousand
[1:54:38] years.
[1:54:40] That is God. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says the first Adam
[1:54:47] was the living soul.
[1:54:49] But the second aid being Jesus Christ is
[1:54:53] the quickening spirit.
[1:54:55] Now the first Eve
[1:54:58] was the one that fell. But the bride
[1:55:02] being the second Eve is infallible.
[1:55:09] I'm talking to the infallible one.
[1:55:12] [Music]
[1:55:14] You are the one that you will never
[1:55:16] fall.
[1:55:18] You are the one that will benefit
[1:55:22] from where Eve fell
[1:55:26] from where Adam fell.
[1:55:29] He will live that thousand years.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Well, brother was saying
[1:55:43] Jesus
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; for him to be in this earth
[1:55:47] He wanted to bring back
[1:55:50] that man has lost
[1:55:53] because if he doesn't bring back
[1:55:56] Satan Satan
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; is the winner. Now Satan cannot be the
[1:56:01] winner from Revelation 12.
[1:56:06] He tried in heaven.
[1:56:08] He couldn't win. He will try here. He
[1:56:12] will not win. He will try later.
[1:56:17] to win.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I read just the elect goes in that time.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The time of millennia
[1:56:32] on then brother. What type of people
[1:56:35] should we be?
[1:56:38] I want to live through the millennium.
[1:56:41] Let us lay aside every weight and sin
[1:56:44] that so easily beset us.
[1:56:49] If the fellow says something wrong
[1:56:52] or does something this way,
[1:56:55] pray for him and keep moving on,
[1:57:00] let your one alternative be set towards
[1:57:02] God.
[1:57:07] If nobody else makes it,
[1:57:11] you make it.
[1:57:13] For there's going to be an elect
[1:57:16] who's going to live
[1:57:19] through the millennium period
[1:57:21] and will go in and out with Christ for a
[1:57:26] thousand years and then shall go up into
[1:57:31] glory
[1:57:33] with him and return again. When the
[1:57:36] resurrection of the wicked is brought
[1:57:38] forth,
[1:57:41] then the millennium set in
[1:57:45] the end of the thousand years.
[1:57:48] He will return with the church.
[1:57:53] Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Christ comes three times.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; First,
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; he came to redeem.
[1:58:03] He
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; is redeeming us. He's redeeming his
[1:58:06] church
[1:58:08] for only that three purposes.
[1:58:12] Is that right? Amen.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Secondly, he come to receive his church.
[1:58:19] Thirdly, he come with his church.

[1:58:27] He come to redeem her. He comes to
[1:58:30] rapture.

[1:58:35] in the time of the plagues and so forth.
[1:58:39] Return back for the millennium.
[1:58:42] Live the millennium. Amen. Amen. When
[1:58:46] Christ died on the cross,
[1:58:49] he was redeeming us.
[1:58:52] For we were born in this world,
[1:58:55] the world of sin, shaped in iniquity.
[1:58:59] He must cleanse us. He must redeem us.
[1:59:04] When we are redeemed,
[1:59:06] we are his church. We are his bride and
[1:59:10] he rapture us. When he rapture us, he
[1:59:14] take us to the millennium.
[1:59:19] Amen. Amen. That's where we will enjoy
[1:59:22] with him.
[1:59:24] Like a brother,
[1:59:26] when you get married, you want to please
[1:59:29] your wife.
[1:59:31] on a millennium
[1:59:33] and you start preparing that journey.
[1:59:37] Let's say you are not flying.
[1:59:40] You are driving to wherever you'll be
[1:59:42] driving. But along the way, you have
[1:59:46] some stop, have some snacks,
[1:59:50] refreshment, you're still driving, you
[1:59:53] are still in a journey. And then when
[1:59:55] you reach your destination,
[1:59:58] that's where
[2:00:02] You relax.
[2:00:04] Now you start to tell your wife
[2:00:08] what is her future
[2:00:11] future. Why you chose amongst all women?
[2:00:16] You start telling her those things.
[2:00:18] How long is the honeymoon?
[2:00:34] During our time,
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; it was not compulsory to go for
[2:00:42] but now we got married in your list
[2:00:48] will check
[2:00:50] why there's no honeymoon.
[2:00:55] It's it's kind of compulsor
[2:01:00] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; So now that's where you start to I don't
[2:01:03] know whether you're going to take two
[2:01:05] weeks or a month
[2:01:07] but whatever time you taking our Lord
[2:01:10] Jesus Christ take us to the millennium
[2:01:15] thousand years.
[2:01:18] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; How much he loved us.
[2:01:22] We are part of him.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; When all those wars come
[2:01:28] When we are the bright in the bright
[2:01:30] ages brother and sister when we are
[2:01:33] enjoying ourselves we are just in a time
[2:01:37] we are just going somewhere
[2:01:39] when we get into the rapture rapture is
[2:01:42] a time
[2:01:44] three and a half years
[2:01:46] do not end there but we are still
[2:01:49] continuing and we go to the
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; millennia
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; millennia
[2:01:54] where our Lord Jesus Christ will be able
[2:01:58] to tell us all
[2:02:00] for a thousand years.
[2:02:03] A years that no one has ever lived in
[2:02:06] this world.
[2:02:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; We will be there with you and there is a
[2:02:15] time. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; So that time we will be enjoying
[2:02:21] ourselves.
[2:02:23] If you miss rapture don't expect
[2:02:26] yourself in the millennium
[2:02:29] a rapture or as we are today we are in a
[2:02:33] journey we go to the rapture still is in
[2:02:36] a journey maybe when you are going to
[2:02:38] Cape Town we are in blue fondane but
[2:02:42] when we are in rapture we are already
[2:02:45] about to enter because the rapture is
[2:02:48] just ushering us to the millennium then
[2:02:52] you reach your destination is not ending
[2:02:55] there. We are going somewhere.
[2:02:58] Today we talk only about this.
[2:03:02] God give us time will continue.
[2:03:05] So now we have Israel, a nation that is
[2:03:10] well respected amongst all the nations,
[2:03:14] can be hated by many but is the nation
[2:03:18] that God loves.
[2:03:20] [Applause]
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:22] Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; You can be hated by men,
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; but you are the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; that he loved.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; So now the millennium of thousand years
[2:03:40] belongs to us as the bride of Jesus
[2:03:43] Christ. Where will Israel be? What is
[2:03:46] happening with them? What is happen with
[2:03:48] the vision? in the fool and the
[2:03:51] unbelievers.
[2:03:52] You will see as we go. Brother said,
[2:03:56] "Ira
[2:03:58] had their millennia
[2:04:01] here in this earth." Do you understand?
[2:04:04] We will be having our
[2:04:08] listening to this man from
[2:04:12] Joshua yesterday. I was listening to I
[2:04:16] could see
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; he needs help.
[2:04:22] You know, he's talking about how the
[2:04:25] European took our resources.
[2:04:33] Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; But he does not know. Remember that man
[2:04:37] I'm talking about
[2:04:39] in his heyday.
[2:04:42] You couldn't stand before him. He was
[2:04:44] the most powerful preacher.
[2:04:47] He was a bishop bishop. But today since
[2:04:51] have turned like this you know why he
[2:04:54] looked up to here
[2:04:56] up to the resources of this world but we
[2:05:00] look beyond the resources of this world.
[2:05:03] When you look beyond the resources of
[2:05:05] this world,
[2:05:07] you see a thousand years in the
[2:05:10] millennium that God is given to us. You
[2:05:14] can take the resources.
[2:05:16] You can take the man of this world. I
[2:05:18] don't care. What I will care the most is
[2:05:21] when I see myself in the millennium that
[2:05:25] God has prepared for me. I said it last
[2:05:28] time that God is a good God. when they
[2:05:32] take the the minerals,
[2:05:36] God is preparing us to the millennium.
[2:05:41] That is why God, he finished the course
[2:05:45] of life
[2:05:47] through Africa. I want that thing in
[2:05:50] you.
[2:05:52] people, you are lesser than anybody else
[2:05:56] because God has given you what the world
[2:06:00] does not have. When we go this message,
[2:06:04] we go back to Israel. Listen to what
[2:06:07] brother Brennham says.
[2:06:09] He set Israel ahead millennia.
[2:06:14] I read God gave Solomon a gift and all
[2:06:19] the whole church.
[2:06:21] Everybody believed in it.
[2:06:24] That was a millennium for the Jewish.
[2:06:29] That was the Old Testament millennium
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; in the days of Solomon.
[2:06:38] Yes.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; A for
[2:06:41] millennium to come.
[2:06:44] And I said,
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; "The richest people in the world
[2:06:49] are Jewish people. They scattered the
[2:06:52] entire world. They own everything
[2:06:56] on the natural side and is what God has
[2:06:59] given today. lucky we are this morning
[2:07:03] because God has gave us everything that
[2:07:07] belongs to heaven.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; So we have two people here. We have the
[2:07:15] natural people that God has blessed
[2:07:19] the spiritual people that God has
[2:07:21] blessed and us
[2:07:26] thousand years for the Israelites
[2:07:29] 40 years.
[2:07:32] Amen.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; The golden age of the Jewish
[2:07:40] notice, nobody started war with them.
[2:07:45] They feared them because they knew their
[2:07:48] God was
[2:07:51] because they had him in their presence.
[2:07:54] The people was all in one heart,
[2:07:58] one accord.
[2:08:01] Why? Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; The fame went everywhere.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Everywhere. And you hear, "Oh, what a
[2:08:08] great thing.
[2:08:10] Great God. Israel
[2:08:12] has a living God.
[2:08:16] Everybody
[2:08:18] has realized that Israel has a real God,
[2:08:23] has a living God. The entire nation
[2:08:29] they knew Israel. That was the
[2:08:31] millennium.
[2:08:33] David was a fighter.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; He was fighting the Philistine. He was
[2:08:38] fighting the pes. He was fighting the
[2:08:41] amalachi.
[2:08:42] He was fighting preparing the throne
[2:08:48] son.
[2:08:49] When his son get into the throne status
[2:08:53] changed.
[2:08:55] Hallelujah.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; When the state has changed, Israel is in
[2:09:00] their millennia.
[2:09:02] At the age of 15,
[2:09:04] Solomon,
[2:09:07] he became the king and he ruled for 40
[2:09:10] years.
[2:09:12] He died at the age of 55.
[2:09:15] During that time of 40 years
[2:09:18] there was no war in
[2:09:22] everything
[2:09:24] that they do they were in one heart one
[2:09:28] accord everything they touch
[2:09:33] blossom
[2:09:35] because is the millennium
[2:09:39] and there was never a time in Israel
[2:09:42] like the time of Solomon
[2:09:45] where the whole nation was at peace.
[2:09:49] Even if other nation
[2:09:52] wanted to invade them,
[2:09:54] they are not scared of Israel,
[2:09:57] they were scared of their living.
[2:10:00] They were scared of their living God
[2:10:04] because they realized that if God punish
[2:10:07] you, he will punish you to the fullest.
[2:10:11] You will never stand the wrath of God.
[2:10:15] Don't take chance with God.
[2:10:18] Be a humble brother.
[2:10:20] Be a humble sister. Then God will bless
[2:10:24] you. Don't try to make yourself
[2:10:28] something that is not in the word of
[2:10:30] God. You are trying to fool God. You
[2:10:35] will never stand his wrath.
[2:10:41] other nation that tried to invade
[2:10:43] Israel, they were just shaking
[2:10:47] because when they see Israel fighting,
[2:10:50] they started to realize it's not them,
[2:10:53] it's something else.
[2:10:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. When God said to
[2:10:59] Joshua, "Go to Jero, surround their
[2:11:02] walls."
[2:11:05] At the last day, the seventh day, the
[2:11:08] walls of Jericho
[2:11:10] fell. Was it the sword of Joshua?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Be realistic. It was not. It
[2:11:18] was God. When they start to think about
[2:11:21] it, they started to see none can
[2:11:24] challenge Israel.
[2:11:27] Now brother says the journey they had
[2:11:31] Israelites naturally is the journey we
[2:11:34] are having
[2:11:36] spiritually brothers and sisters none
[2:11:40] can challenge you.
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I want to take it further.
[2:11:51] Whoever can challenge you is challenging
[2:11:54] God. Can you challenge God and win?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Let's not challenge one another.
[2:12:03] [Applause]
[2:12:06] Let's be in one heart.
[2:12:08] Be in one accord.
[2:12:11] We are in the foraste
[2:12:14] of the millennium.
[2:12:17] We are about to go there. Just a matter
[2:12:19] of time.
[2:12:21] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:25] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Because the other people, they just want
[2:12:28] to try to prove who they are to
[2:12:33] know they are challenging God.
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:39] We we think of this
[2:12:41] Solomon
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; in that great millennium of the Jews
[2:12:46] that when no nation
[2:12:49] dare to touch them and the great gift of
[2:12:52] God
[2:12:54] was in the prophet
[2:12:56] till he made it known to the queen
[2:13:00] of all her secrets
[2:13:04] in her heart.
[2:13:06] Nothing was withheld
[2:13:09] but a great age
[2:13:12] showing and typing
[2:13:14] that there was a great age coming
[2:13:18] to us. Don't worry about Maponga and
[2:13:22] them.
[2:13:23] Don't worry about the resources
[2:13:27] of this country of this country. Don't
[2:13:31] worry about the millennium. That's where
[2:13:34] we are going. The Bible says you know
[2:13:38] the only thing that must concern you is
[2:13:42] when you are named is written in the
[2:13:45] lamp.
[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:52] I don't know you listen to the news or
[2:13:53] what
[2:13:59] has dust blowing all over
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; he's not taking chances
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; those untouchables
[2:14:13] in the South African government
[2:14:17] shaking
[2:14:18] but let Let me tell you why is the very
[2:14:21] same people that has the minerals that
[2:14:24] owns mines that owns billions
[2:14:28] and wealth of the country but where are
[2:14:31] they now
[2:14:35] brother don't run after those
[2:14:38] are temporal the word of God teaches us
[2:14:41] there anything that you can see with the
[2:14:46] naked eye is temporal
[2:14:49] And the Bible says the love of money is
[2:14:52] the root of all evil.
[2:14:55] [Applause]
[2:14:57] That is why people like myself when I
[2:15:01] need God, I just go close to the pastor.
[2:15:05] Then I'll come back with job
[2:15:09] to to feed my family.
[2:15:12] But for me to have billions in the
[2:15:13] account,
[2:15:15] I might come back belittling all of you.
[2:15:19] [Applause]
[2:15:23] I'm sorry,
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; but just take them in your heart.
[2:15:33] Amen.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Can we continue?
[2:15:45] Notice
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; this is still not he said the this
[2:15:49] millennium reign
[2:15:52] the thousand years it's not the new
[2:15:55] earth
[2:15:57] it will happen here on earth
[2:16:01] brothers and sisters do you realize how
[2:16:05] much Lord Jesus Christ has honored us
[2:16:13] he honored us. He He take us on his
[2:16:17] journey of life. He give you this
[2:16:20] message. He revealed all the sins for
[2:16:22] you. He manifested all
[2:16:26] you to the rapture after the rapture. He
[2:16:31] take you to the millennia. It's not your
[2:16:34] effort.
[2:16:36] It's not because you can read the
[2:16:37] scripture. It's not because you come to
[2:16:40] church every Sunday. It's not because
[2:16:43] you know better
[2:16:45] that for you
[2:16:48] unconditional love
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:59] the young brothers when you want to get
[2:17:02] married if you are still looking for a
[2:17:05] sister
[2:17:06] one that can cook better one that is
[2:17:09] beautiful on the face one that is
[2:17:11] educated, one that is this and that. You
[2:17:15] are lost. You're looking for something
[2:17:17] else that you cannot eat.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; The one that cook, he can cook less
[2:17:23] today, tomorrow, put more salt.
[2:17:27] I don't know. You're going to divorce.
[2:17:36] Don't put a measure of a standard
[2:17:41] That is so low.
[2:17:44] When you choose a wife, you choose the
[2:17:47] one that is in you.
[2:17:50] [Applause]
[2:17:52] And if you choose the one that is in
[2:17:54] you, if you love her unconditionally,
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:18:02] if she sweat as you, Amen.
[2:18:12] You say, "I like that, honey."
[2:18:16] Don't worry, you're going to the
[2:18:17] millennia.
[2:18:30] I'm trying to say
[2:18:32] in your situation
[2:18:35] condition
[2:18:36] God loved you conditionally
[2:18:41] unconditionally I want you
[2:18:44] when when you say unconditional
[2:18:47] is when you have money you don't have
[2:18:51] money you are sick you are wealthy you
[2:18:56] are educate ated. You are angry. You are
[2:18:59] happy. When I look at you, I just love
[2:19:02] you.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That is an unconditional
[2:19:10] love,
[2:19:12] does not have condition.
[2:19:15] Amen.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; But if you're stilling looking for the
[2:19:17] one that cooks nice,
[2:19:20] good luck.
[2:19:22] Let's continue.
[2:19:24] That's what we go into
[2:19:27] the millennium. We go into the
[2:19:29] millennium. But that isn't the new
[2:19:31] earth,
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; the new heaven.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. That just a rest place.
[2:19:44] Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:46] I was driving
[2:19:48] from Witbank
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; to the pastor's house. Just after the
[2:19:53] toll gate,
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; my car says rest. You need coffee.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Not even 200 kilometers,
[2:20:02] I must rest and drink coffee. No, but
[2:20:06] God gave us the rest place
[2:20:10] of a thousand years.
[2:20:13] Our God is a good God.
[2:20:15] But the rest place in this world
[2:20:18] after 200 kilometers you rest when you
[2:20:21] are driving a long distance you can see
[2:20:24] naturally we we we rest we get tired and
[2:20:28] so forth but the rest of a thousand
[2:20:31] years
[2:20:33] something else if someone
[2:20:36] can look at that and look up to that and
[2:20:40] hold on that is the reality
[2:20:45] When I was with the pastor, he says
[2:20:48] something like, "You know what? When we
[2:20:51] go forward,
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; let's do everything that will please
[2:20:55] God."
[2:20:59] I said, "Amen. Amen.
[2:21:02] do everything that will please God and
[2:21:06] say amen to that
[2:21:10] because we are going to a millennium and
[2:21:13] in a millennium it's not the end of
[2:21:15] things
[2:21:18] and have coffee after coffee we continue
[2:21:22] we are going somewhere
[2:21:24] later
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:21:31] not all the heavens and earth.
[2:21:34] For you see
[2:21:37] in the millennium we have things that
[2:21:40] will not go into that
[2:21:44] is a type
[2:21:46] of the old seventh day.
[2:21:52] The seventh day after he made the world,
[2:21:56] the seventh day he rested in there in
[2:21:58] Eden and the millennium.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Our God is eternal. He's taking us to
[2:22:09] eternity before we hit there. He just
[2:22:12] give us the you know you rest and
[2:22:16] continue. You rest and continue. Not
[2:22:19] because you are tired. You are not
[2:22:22] tired. He He just enjoying himself with
[2:22:26] us.
[2:22:28] I want you children of God to take the
[2:22:31] word of God easy.
[2:22:34] Take it easy. Relax
[2:22:41] because a complete job was done.
[2:22:46] A complete job was done.
[2:22:49] Why are you worried?
[2:22:51] about the things of this world. Relax,
[2:22:54] brother.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; God did everything for you.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know those that had experience
[2:23:06] traveling with their, you know, families
[2:23:09] when as a as a husband
[2:23:12] driving a long distance,
[2:23:15] your wife on the left side,
[2:23:18] sleeping, your kids behind,
[2:23:23] you driving, you maneuver, you do
[2:23:26] everything, you stop somewhere and say,
[2:23:29] "Guys, let's have coffee." And then we
[2:23:33] continue. Then oh where is this place?
[2:23:38] Then we just say no it's just a garage.
[2:23:43] I'm just trying to simplify things.
[2:23:48] They don't even know where they are.
[2:23:50] They don't know how many car missed you
[2:23:52] on the road. You are just fighting for
[2:23:55] them. You were in charge of the car. You
[2:23:58] were in control.
[2:24:00] But your wife and the kids are relaxing
[2:24:04] believing that our father will make us
[2:24:07] reach the destiny.
[2:24:09] [Applause]
[2:24:12] So
[2:24:14] why as a child of God sitting at the
[2:24:18] rear seat telling God
[2:24:27] Papa God
[2:24:30] will just look at them and say, "Hey,
[2:24:34] relax."
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Don't help God.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; That one that says God helps those that
[2:24:55] there is no apostles in here.
[2:25:01] Are we together?
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters,
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; relax
[2:25:07] in the word of God. A complete job was
[2:25:09] done.
[2:25:12] We're just crucifying
[2:25:14] going from level to another level. For
[2:25:17] you to be in the message, it's not
[2:25:20] because you seen better, you understood
[2:25:24] better. Why the next person didn't see
[2:25:28] what you see? It shows it's not you. It
[2:25:32] was God doing it for you.
[2:25:36] So if God has done it for you, why are
[2:25:40] you worried?
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Are we still happy?
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Future home.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Future home. We are going to the
[2:25:53] official home. But before we get there,
[2:25:57] let's see the millennium.
[2:26:01] And notice
[2:26:02] not the perfect world.
[2:26:06] This millennium
[2:26:09] of the seventh day.
[2:26:12] Then comes the white throne judgment.
[2:26:17] See, we still have judgment.
[2:26:19] We still in time in the millennium. It's
[2:26:23] a day. A thousand years. It's a time
[2:26:27] element.
[2:26:30] Don't get mixed up with the new earth
[2:26:33] because it's not
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; is time.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Armageddon.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Armageddon
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; is time.
[2:26:48] Rapture is time.
[2:26:51] Millennium
[2:26:53] is time. You understand? White throne
[2:26:56] judgment.
[2:26:59] Go and make time. New city
[2:27:03] is no time.
[2:27:07] So we are going to a place of no time.
[2:27:12] But along the way we have those
[2:27:16] rest
[2:27:18] joy
[2:27:20] go
[2:27:23] are we together as I was just giving
[2:27:25] this example when you travel with your
[2:27:27] family I don't know about you but now
[2:27:31] when I travel with my family
[2:27:34] my wife my kids are sleeping
[2:27:37] but here we are we reach all the
[2:27:39] destinated
[2:27:42] Because they have a trust that daddy
[2:27:46] will make us rich.
[2:27:49] You are daddy. God will make you.
[2:27:55] You don't need to help him.
[2:28:00] He knew Satan. He defeated Satan. He
[2:28:05] will defeat Satan. He's going to defeat
[2:28:07] Satan.
[2:28:09] If God did that or is doing there just
[2:28:14] be with him just follow him.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; We continue on the future home spoken
[2:28:28] with spoken future home.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Notice
[2:28:32] seven days only has to do with the old
[2:28:37] creation.
[2:28:40] The world time
[2:28:43] seven days that's the millennium
[2:28:47] the the the rest day as God labor six
[2:28:51] days
[2:28:55] labor six days
[2:28:58] the rest the seventh
[2:29:01] still in time amenment
[2:29:03] and speaking of eternal
[2:29:06] but you
[2:29:08] There's no such a thing as eighth day.
[2:29:13] Go back to the first day.
[2:29:15] The first day, the Sabbath
[2:29:19] speaks of the old law
[2:29:21] which must pass away or
[2:29:25] have to change to another.
[2:29:28] It didn't pass away. just changed from
[2:29:32] the old law
[2:29:34] keeping a certain day of the week and
[2:29:38] that Sabbath was for the Jewish. Now we
[2:29:42] are in them which Sabbath
[2:29:46] we are resting but the rest day that we
[2:29:50] need that will not see death
[2:29:54] is the millennia.
[2:29:58] We labored for six days.
[2:30:02] When we labor for six days and the
[2:30:04] churches is come,
[2:30:07] the seventh one is the end of
[2:30:10] everything. No wonder brother Brandham
[2:30:12] says we are no longer in church. As the
[2:30:17] seventh church age,
[2:30:20] we are in the bright age. The bright age
[2:30:25] is the foretaste
[2:30:27] of eternity.
[2:30:29] If we are in the bright age started
[2:30:32] crucified
[2:30:34] anytime
[2:30:36] rapture can take place
[2:30:40] and I repeat don't say hey the message
[2:30:44] today was wonderful
[2:30:47] I'm going to start working for God.
[2:30:50] You're wasting your time.
[2:30:53] Don't even there because you will be
[2:30:58] deceiving yourself.
[2:31:00] You are not going to start living right
[2:31:04] doing the right thing after this sermon
[2:31:07] if you are blessed this morning. But the
[2:31:10] living right will be with God has
[2:31:13] started in eternity. It will go to
[2:31:16] eternity. It's a life of God in a human
[2:31:20] being. That is why the blood at the
[2:31:23] cross was meant for you and me.
[2:31:27] Others is foolish.
[2:31:29] You and me.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; It's something else.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Are we still together?
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Oh yeah,
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; help us Lord.
[2:31:50] If there's one, he let us go to his
[2:31:54] wedding supper of the lamb.
[2:32:00] Yes. This thousand years of millennium,
[2:32:02] right?
[2:32:04] And to then enter into the city after
[2:32:08] the honeymoon is over.
[2:32:11] The millennium
[2:32:13] is merely the honeymoon.
[2:32:16] Then she the bride take his bridegroom
[2:32:20] take his bride home
[2:32:22] it's hers bridegroom his bride or he's
[2:32:27] gone to prepare the house
[2:32:30] he's become engaged
[2:32:33] as I said amen there at the honeymoon
[2:32:36] there in your millennium
[2:32:39] where that's where the bride and the
[2:32:43] groom
[2:32:46] Amen.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I will build a house for you
[2:32:53] in Midland
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; or in Centurion.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; And then the wife started to say, "Oh,
[2:33:01] wow.
[2:33:02] Things will work out here." You
[2:33:04] understand?
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then yeah, I'll make sure you
[2:33:09] don't suffer
[2:33:11] financially
[2:33:13] when the kids come in the house.
[2:33:15] Everything will be fine.
[2:33:18] That's the promise.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; How many achieved?
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you an honest truth. We
[2:33:34] promise all those.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's like studying a business.
[2:33:46] You you you sleep, not sleep, but you
[2:33:49] just close your eyes. You see yourself
[2:33:52] flying to Dubai.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; All the people when they see you, they
[2:33:57] salute you. You just give them money.
[2:34:02] is when you are just relaxing. But when
[2:34:04] you face really
[2:34:08] you don't even have a bicycle
[2:34:12] when you come from a honeymoon
[2:34:16] you are sleeping
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; sometimes you sleeping
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; and then the wife will say
[2:34:26] now realize things are tough you start
[2:34:28] to work and that's why others end up
[2:34:32] committing fraud to get money
[2:34:36] Don't do that as a child of God. You
[2:34:40] relax, God will do things for you. If
[2:34:43] you you need something, it will never
[2:34:46] make you to disrespect God
[2:34:51] for you. Some of the things God does not
[2:34:54] give to us
[2:34:56] because he knows
[2:34:59] if I can give this one. Billion 1.8
[2:35:03] [Applause]
[2:35:05] [Music]
[2:35:09] Even
[2:35:11] car I don't want to give it to him.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; I will give him TT
[2:35:17] Toyota T
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; then
[2:35:20] you continue with it
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; and he will just we are saying heaven we
[2:35:25] go
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; and God will love you in that way.
[2:35:32] No, I hope
[2:35:35] you're not driving.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; I was just giving an example.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he comes in three names.
[2:35:53] The son of man, a prophet, the son of
[2:35:57] God, the spirit, the son of David for
[2:36:01] the millennia.
[2:36:03] That is our God. He He was the son of
[2:36:06] man, the son of God. He will be the son
[2:36:11] of David. Who's the son of David?
[2:36:14] Solomon.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Solomon the son of David is
[2:36:20] the one that God made him to create
[2:36:24] millennium in Israel.
[2:36:29] But in fact the son of David is the Lord
[2:36:32] Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ will
[2:36:36] be the one that will bring millennia for
[2:36:40] his bride. And here we are this morning.
[2:36:45] We are the beneficiary of
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Few minutes
[2:37:00] uh question and answers. The people ask
[2:37:02] brother a question.
[2:37:06] They said now
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; if if time sees
[2:37:12] let me put it in this way.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seals were open
[2:37:17] then the millennium is also
[2:37:22] finished
[2:37:24] is a question.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Answer and say no no time didn't seize
[2:37:35] when seals were open misunderstood it.
[2:37:40] What happened? The mystery
[2:37:44] was revealed.
[2:37:46] No time sees.
[2:37:49] Watch real close now. Okay. He was
[2:37:52] playing the tape for them. Time never
[2:37:55] cease until
[2:37:58] be a postmillennialist
[2:38:00] or something that as the question.
[2:38:03] We got a thousand years. After church
[2:38:06] has gone home, come back to the earth.
[2:38:09] Then time cease.
[2:38:11] in the new heavens
[2:38:15] and the new earth. Now, millennium is
[2:38:18] not the new heaven and the new earth
[2:38:22] will still be seen
[2:38:25] after the millennium. A millennium is a
[2:38:29] type of Noah going
[2:38:32] and carried over and brought him and
[2:38:36] them on the other side and the sin
[2:38:40] and the sin ever come out of the ark.
[2:38:44] What is saying here in the ark there
[2:38:48] were people that were safe when they
[2:38:52] come out sin was still there in the
[2:38:55] millennium we will be there after the
[2:38:58] millennium sin will be there
[2:39:01] maybe you don't know what he's talking
[2:39:03] about is the message that I'm preparing
[2:39:06] to preach thereafter
[2:39:09] I want to show you just a tip of it says
[2:39:11] After
[2:39:14] the millennium,
[2:39:16] the devil
[2:39:18] will come
[2:39:20] to fight you with Christ and that will
[2:39:26] be the end of sin.
[2:39:30] Revelation 12 says there was a war in
[2:39:34] heaven. In that war in heaven, Lucifer
[2:39:39] and his angel fought Michael and his
[2:39:42] angel, but he couldn't conquer them.
[2:39:46] After the millennium,
[2:39:48] Lucifer and his angel, Michael and his
[2:39:53] angel with fire and Michael will consume
[2:39:57] them with fire. That will be the end of
[2:40:05] Amen.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; But Enoch, the translated one,
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; was the type of the bride that went up,
[2:40:15] not the one that was carried over.
[2:40:18] The sin
[2:40:20] will still be on the other side of the
[2:40:22] millennium.
[2:40:24] During the millennium
[2:40:27] is peace, but sin will dealt with on
[2:40:32] will dealt with
[2:40:35] after the millennium
[2:40:37] when that time fades out.
[2:40:41] Now the opening of the seals
[2:40:44] was
[2:40:45] that was given by the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:48] The seventh seal only was to make known
[2:40:53] what had been left off
[2:40:56] in the dispensation behind us.
[2:41:01] Are we together? Amen.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; So the seven seals
[2:41:05] were was dealing with that.
[2:41:07] But in the millennium
[2:41:10] we will be at peace.
[2:41:14] Now as some great theologian tried to
[2:41:16] corner me on that.
[2:41:20] He said,
[2:41:22] "Uh, you God someday will give you the
[2:41:25] secret of those seven seals.
[2:41:28] Those seven seals will something that
[2:41:30] will never land yet.
[2:41:34] That will be something that's even not
[2:41:36] in the Bible.
[2:41:39] No, no, it won't be that because if you
[2:41:42] do, that will make it
[2:41:45] me a false prophet.
[2:41:48] Everything that's there, the whole
[2:41:51] revelation of Jesus Christ is all
[2:41:53] completed
[2:41:55] in this weight.
[2:41:58] And if the seven seals
[2:42:01] pertained to the seven church ages,
[2:42:05] it had to be already passed
[2:42:10] because we are in Laia church
[2:42:13] and the seven seals was only revealing
[2:42:17] what they have left back there and it
[2:42:20] opened up and they have left what Luda
[2:42:24] left
[2:42:27] Wesley left all the reformers and the
[2:42:31] Pentecostal
[2:42:32] and down to the present time. The next
[2:42:35] thing left is the translation
[2:42:40] of the church. The return of Moses and
[2:42:44] Elijah,
[2:42:46] the reign, the millennium reign
[2:42:49] upon the earth with the bride and the
[2:42:52] groom
[2:42:53] for a thousand years. Then the judgment
[2:42:56] part and then the total annulation of
[2:42:59] sea
[2:43:02] will never be no more at that time.
[2:43:06] Now
[2:43:07] the seals never ended time
[2:43:12] or season
[2:43:14] until after the millennium.
[2:43:17] No, it still be time until after the
[2:43:22] millennium.
[2:43:24] Is it clear to the children of God?
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; What is happen? The seven seals
[2:43:29] came
[2:43:31] to reveal what was left behind. That is
[2:43:36] why brother Brandham says we are from
[2:43:38] the church ages.
[2:43:40] The first one until to the last one. But
[2:43:43] the seven seal is when you bring God
[2:43:48] from heaven down here and cap
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; the pyramid. Pyramid
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; is the capping of the pyramid.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When I was with the pastor
[2:44:00] was saying when I come I will tell the
[2:44:03] children of God about the rapture light.
[2:44:09] Tell the children of God about the
[2:44:12] pyramid.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; Who is the pyramid?
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; Wait for that.
[2:44:18] [Applause]
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; I didn't know my code were this many.
[2:44:27] Let me skip.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Let me skip others and go straight to
[2:44:34] the end and close.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:38] But the best thing you can do to a human
[2:44:40] being is tired.
[2:44:46] Don't say and I'll make sure the moment
[2:44:49] you think I'll go forward, I'll stop.
[2:44:54] But now he is through the church age.
[2:44:58] Now
[2:45:00] he has been the son of God. in the
[2:45:02] millennium
[2:45:04] he'll be the son of David sitting on
[2:45:06] David's throne but between this time
[2:45:10] found out by the scriptures he is to
[2:45:13] reveal himself again as the son of God
[2:45:18] prophet
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; can I tell you this you are the
[2:45:23] prophetic class
[2:45:26] tells you this
[2:45:28] this time is he revealing himself
[2:45:31] We know him better. There's no other
[2:45:34] people that can talk about him except
[2:45:37] ourselves.
[2:45:39] [Applause]
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; We are facing Eden again.
[2:45:48] Amen.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; I want to
[2:45:51] read the last quote.
[2:45:54] Amen. Amen. Then I close. He said his
[2:45:57] physical being
[2:46:01] physical being
[2:46:03] was raised up to the throne of God
[2:46:07] where the spirit was on the throne.
[2:46:11] Now Christ is on the throne
[2:46:14] a little while and well sees me no more
[2:46:18] yet you shall see.
[2:46:21] He's referring
[2:46:24] this time. The world will not see him,
[2:46:28] but we shall see
[2:46:32] for I'll be with you to the end of the
[2:46:35] world even in you.
[2:46:42] This is the only time is the only moment
[2:46:46] when God is in a human being.
[2:46:50] I repeat myself since the world began
[2:46:55] from Genesis from the time of Eden until
[2:46:59] today there was never a time where God
[2:47:03] was in the human being like our time. So
[2:47:07] our time is where God says I will even
[2:47:13] be in
[2:47:15] [Applause]
[2:47:17] God whom you worship
[2:47:20] is in you.

[2:47:43] The throne of God,
[2:47:45] Christ is erected in your heart
[2:47:50] and he's sitting on God's throne.
[2:47:53] But in the millennia
[2:47:56] on his own throne,
[2:47:58] which he saw that he'd raise up a man,
[2:48:03] his son, David's son, to sit on the
[2:48:07] throne.
[2:48:08] Amen. Amen. Listen to what is saying
[2:48:12] attentively.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; All along he was with them.
[2:48:19] Now is with is in us.
[2:48:23] He's in us again. Then when we go to the
[2:48:28] rapture to the millennium, he's no
[2:48:31] longer in us but is with us. We reign
[2:48:37] with him.
[2:48:39] separate himself from us to him as a
[2:48:43] stand alone. So that we can look at him.
[2:48:47] We can look at him. He can look at us is
[2:48:52] the groom. We are the bride. That is the
[2:48:55] millennium.
[2:48:58] Like a young man, you don't tell us, but
[2:49:02] you know the kind of a woman you want.
[2:49:05] That woman,
[2:49:07] that woman is in you.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When he's in you at the
[2:49:15] right time, we will be with her. And
[2:49:19] then when we are with her, we will be
[2:49:21] able to tell
[2:49:24] them, the bride and the groom. That's
[2:49:27] what is happening. We were in God. Now
[2:49:31] God is in us at the millennium.
[2:49:34] God will be with us. We will be his
[2:49:37] bride. We will be our groom.
[2:49:41] And it goes on and on and on like that.
[2:49:44] And let me just stop here by just asking
[2:49:47] you this question because
[2:49:50] do you love him?
[2:49:52] Do you believe him? Are you sick and
[2:49:54] tired of Satan's kingdom?
