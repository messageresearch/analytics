either extremely high speed or extremely slow until sister footy offered to take over the driving along the way i continued having this strange feeling of being half conscious but i didn't tell anyone in the car until a point where i felt i could not breathe at all i stood up in the car and started throwing up inside the car the car stopped and very little i remember of what happened thereafter i was told by my family that after they moved me out of the car i just stopped breathing and passed out they told me that they immediately called pratham kise and informed him of the situation who quickly informed the pastor in a telephone call pastor called my name three times then prayed it was after the pastor's prayer that i slowly started gaining consciousness i was shocked to see so many people around me and that i was lying down outside in the bush i was told by my family that before the pastor's prayer they had tried all possible first aid techniques but they could not fill any parts i was then moved back to the car and the pastor called again and said a thanksgiving prayer i was able to hear the pastor during the second prayer as i was fully conscious by then thereafter i

the people who are so loving and wonderful people yes whom i thought that having gone to spend eternity together [Music] because you go through the stages when we were still young like policies i i when i was young every person was together with me we were together for eternity [Music] actually eternity is the word of god to be wonderful people they have fallen off but we really and i wonder

circumcised that he is adapted to do the whole whole law [Music] there for in jesus christ neither circumcised jesus christ anything nor uncircumcision but faith which workers by love uh paul was getting deeper into the circumcised and the uncircumcised because they were holding to their father's traditions the spoken word is the original siege spoken which is the original side of god here is the secret name you'll hear me one day talking about jesus saying here is the secret thing you know if somebody says to you wanted to go away secrets this church is singing dancing nice [Applause]

creation that means he was the son of god because you are going to see yourself what was born away now going [Applause] i'll the bride of christ nobody has got christians going from this stage to that stage if you look back you see that we are now looking at the roots of things easy now your root impaired that you can kill holy they are going nowhere is [Music] nowhere he or she is right yeah no

[Music] god they are devils and the pastor agreed with me but [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] she kept on saying what he might jesus what you [Applause] jesus [Applause] come to the service and
