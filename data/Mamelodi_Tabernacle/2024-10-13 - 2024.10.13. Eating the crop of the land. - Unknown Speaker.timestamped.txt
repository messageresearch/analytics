[1:14:28] speaker going to take much of your
[1:14:31] time not even more than an
[1:14:34] hour but let's look upon what the
[1:14:37] scriptures said
[1:14:39] here my title this
[1:14:41] morning is about eating the corn of the
[1:14:46] land but my
[1:14:49] subtitle is what our pastor was saying
[1:14:52] the other
[1:14:53] day when was listening I conned this to
[1:14:57] this
[1:14:58] message because he said don't L to the
[1:15:03] right look to the
[1:15:06] left now the prophet says just speak and
[1:15:10] go
[1:15:11] forward amen that will be my
[1:15:15] subtitle don't look to the
[1:15:17] right to the left straight because you
[1:15:22] were born with a purpose
[1:15:25] don't let
[1:15:26] anyone hind you for the purpose that
[1:15:31] God
[1:15:33] Amen we we we see lot
[1:15:41] here amen verse S and the Lord said I
[1:15:46] have surely seen the
[1:15:48] application of my people which are in
[1:15:51] Egypt and have heard their cry
[1:15:56] by the reason of their task
[1:15:59] Masters so I know their are
[1:16:02] sorrows amen amen so God has has had the
[1:16:07] Cry of
[1:16:09] Israel and he started to prepare
[1:16:12] them for the day of
[1:16:15] departure and God sent
[1:16:18] Moses he prepared the children of
[1:16:21] Israel he prepared
[1:16:23] Moses see
[1:16:25] again preparing
[1:16:29] phara amen amen so the entire
[1:16:34] world the entire life we live in this
[1:16:39] world everything has prepared by God
[1:16:44] himself you may think some of the things
[1:16:47] are not good
[1:16:49] things but God allowed
[1:16:52] them God prepared them
[1:16:55] for a certain
[1:16:57] purpose that you might not
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:05] see let's sing a worshiping
[1:17:10] song Amen
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:26] be
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:29] ready
[1:17:33] Jesus
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:38] ready be
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:44] ready be
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:52] ready ready
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:00] Jus amen
[1:18:03] amen so we see God preparing
[1:18:08] everything and the Bible says everything
[1:18:13] was
[1:18:14] prepared by him before the
[1:18:18] foundation what is happening in your
[1:18:21] life is just the unfolding
[1:18:25] until brother Bram says even if I can
[1:18:29] take me to hell even if God can take me
[1:18:34] to I will still love
[1:18:38] him he's trying to tell you that there's
[1:18:42] nothing you can
[1:18:43] do but it's God who did
[1:18:47] everything before the foundation of the
[1:18:50] world he knew what you went through
[1:18:55] he has prepared you
[1:18:58] already amen amen if he has prepared you
[1:19:02] already and you know your purpose don't
[1:19:06] look to the left don't look to the right
[1:19:10] just walk on the
[1:19:13] purpose has called
[1:19:16] you amen amen let's read exod chapter 7
[1:19:21] exod 7 verse 1 to 4 verse 1 to
[1:19:29] 4 and the Lord said unto Moses see I
[1:19:33] have made thee a God to faraoh and Aaron
[1:19:36] thy brother shall be thy Prophet Thou
[1:19:38] shalt speak all that I command thee and
[1:19:41] Aon thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh
[1:19:44] that he send the children of Israel out
[1:19:46] of his land and I will harden Pharaoh's
[1:19:50] heart and multiply my signs and my
[1:19:53] wonders in the land of Egypt
[1:19:56] eypt
[1:19:59] continue but Pharaoh shall not hecken
[1:20:01] unto you that I may lay my hand upon
[1:20:05] Egypt and bring forth my armies and my
[1:20:09] people the children of Israel out of the
[1:20:11] land of Egypt by great judgments amen
[1:20:14] amen so you see the previous
[1:20:17] verse God was telling Moses
[1:20:20] that I have heard the
[1:20:23] Cry of the of Israel but I've chosen you
[1:20:28] to be a
[1:20:29] deliverer but here where we just read he
[1:20:33] said to Moses it was part of the
[1:20:35] preparation of
[1:20:38] God God the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:20:42] I will make you
[1:20:44] Moses
[1:20:47] god I will make
[1:20:50] you amen amen so I'm preparing you then
[1:20:54] I will prepare
[1:20:56] Aon your brother to be your
[1:21:00] Prophet you will speak to Aon Aon will
[1:21:04] speak to
[1:21:06] Pharaoh I will harden the heart of
[1:21:11] Phar some other people that are
[1:21:14] stubborn is God who their
[1:21:17] heart for a certain purpose because
[1:21:21] before the for of the world he has
[1:21:24] prepared
[1:21:26] he knew our end before our beginning
[1:21:30] that is
[1:21:31] God it it looks
[1:21:34] somehow when he said I will harden the
[1:21:37] heart of
[1:21:39] pharaoh it should be like
[1:21:41] that because he want to show his power
[1:21:46] that is why some of our
[1:21:50] diseases who allowed them
[1:21:55] so that we can see the power of
[1:22:01] God you have done nothing wrong but
[1:22:05] sometimes maybe you do not appreciate
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:09] enough he will put you in a
[1:22:12] situation where you will forcefully
[1:22:17] appreciate because he is
[1:22:20] God by so saying you no longer worry
[1:22:24] about yourself but you look up to
[1:22:30] God God knows everything about
[1:22:35] you amen amen faith is the substance
[1:22:39] spoken
[1:22:40] with is a substance spoken with spoken
[1:22:43] with it says and then they begin to cry
[1:22:47] to
[1:22:48] God for a
[1:22:52] deliverer is that right and they cried
[1:22:55] and
[1:22:56] cried and God for ordained a
[1:23:01] deliverer is that right that deliverer
[1:23:04] was
[1:23:05] Moses fored him foration of
[1:23:11] God ordination of God it happened before
[1:23:16] the foundation of
[1:23:17] the before the foundation of the world
[1:23:20] when God looked at Moses he saw him
[1:23:25] as the
[1:23:27] Deliverance nothing much nothing he was
[1:23:30] born to
[1:23:32] deliver the children of Israel to cross
[1:23:36] the Red
[1:23:37] Sea things may
[1:23:39] come negatively from both
[1:23:43] directions they are not going to hinder
[1:23:47] Moses in any way in
[1:23:50] any to deliver the children of God
[1:23:56] you know in a Christian Journey there
[1:23:58] are a lot of things that will hinder you
[1:24:02] but they are not going to stop your
[1:24:05] purpose so you must not look to the
[1:24:07] right you must not look to the left we
[1:24:11] must go on that's what our pastors told
[1:24:14] us those we shall even stand
[1:24:19] today go
[1:24:23] forward amen
[1:24:24] amen so it happens that way and those
[1:24:28] that ask for a deliverer and the
[1:24:31] deliverer came and they be against the
[1:24:36] Deliverance it's a human being because
[1:24:39] they think he must come in a certain
[1:24:43] way their way not the God's way because
[1:24:47] the God's way is always
[1:24:52] peculiar amen amen for you to see the
[1:24:56] God's Will and the God's way you must
[1:25:00] have been with
[1:25:02] God when he say let us make a man in our
[1:25:07] own image if you were with him you will
[1:25:11] see the image of
[1:25:13] God once you see the image of God canot
[1:25:17] be
[1:25:20] contrary be careful when we are contrary
[1:25:24] sometimes
[1:25:25] we might not have come to the same
[1:25:31] Source I'm speak about the Deep calling
[1:25:33] to the
[1:25:35] Deep when I speak and you speak Amen
[1:25:42] to the only man that contradicted the
[1:25:46] word of
[1:25:47] God is the
[1:25:49] devil he he contradicted the word of God
[1:25:53] he wanted to do better than
[1:25:55] God he found himself in a t
[1:26:00] area amen amen that is that man and that
[1:26:03] man has follow
[1:26:07] us if you follow him you will
[1:26:11] forever contct the word of
[1:26:15] God amen amen that is why God said to
[1:26:20] Moses I am preparing you to have power
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:27] authority over the entire
[1:26:30] Egypt every weight that you speak will
[1:26:34] come into
[1:26:36] existence because God bring things into
[1:26:40] existence then we see Moses going but
[1:26:43] there will be people that will be
[1:26:46] against the word of
[1:26:48] Moses because to begin with they were
[1:26:51] not with him
[1:26:55] am amen amen you know in our corporate
[1:26:58] out
[1:27:00] there we normally say we disagree to
[1:27:04] agree or agree to
[1:27:09] disagree but in the word of God is only
[1:27:14] believe have faith in
[1:27:17] God amen amen when God has
[1:27:21] spoken we respond positively
[1:27:25] something will tell you in the heart
[1:27:28] that this is right this is that says the
[1:27:32] Lord that's how the word of God is then
[1:27:36] Moses became
[1:27:38] God and when Moses is God the others
[1:27:43] mama why Moses is God why God made
[1:27:48] God and the prophet but that was the
[1:27:53] plan of God
[1:27:56] amen amen you you you cannot defy the
[1:27:59] word of
[1:28:02] God of God you just need to accept
[1:28:06] him you just need to sing this
[1:28:09] song where he leads
[1:28:14] me where he leads
[1:28:18] me the word of God is not like in our
[1:28:21] corporate meeting
[1:28:24] we
[1:28:25] argue the word of God is like when
[1:28:28] someone talk according to the word of
[1:28:31] God say Amen
[1:28:35] am amen that is one of the
[1:28:39] purpose the children of Israel were just
[1:28:42] supposed to say a they were supposed to
[1:28:45] say amen amen Moses has
[1:28:49] spoken because he's God amongst us
[1:28:54] he was the man in
[1:28:56] charge was listened to at that
[1:29:01] time amen amen until Moses had an
[1:29:07] headache when he was pulling them out
[1:29:10] of when he faced the Red
[1:29:13] Sea he wanted to see the
[1:29:16] psychiatrist the
[1:29:18] Physicians specialist because he was
[1:29:22] like is this thing possible
[1:29:25] I took them out of Egypt now they are
[1:29:28] against
[1:29:29] me now God
[1:29:31] responded to him and say Moses why
[1:29:36] cry
[1:29:39] speak there is time for prayer but
[1:29:43] there's time for
[1:29:44] speaking there's time for
[1:29:48] claiming When you pray is a good thing
[1:29:52] but when you claim you are in
[1:29:56] purose he gave us that
[1:30:00] Authority he was trying to tell Moses
[1:30:04] whatever you want to do will happen
[1:30:08] now he was trying to tell Moses you are
[1:30:12] God God is the Creator God knows
[1:30:15] everything when speak things come into
[1:30:21] existence amen amen and God said
[1:30:25] I will
[1:30:26] even
[1:30:27] Harden the heart of
[1:30:29] PHA it was not
[1:30:32] certain who
[1:30:34] hadn't is
[1:30:37] God because he want the entire world
[1:30:40] know that is God God
[1:30:44] created the Heaven the H and the
[1:30:50] under God created them no one
[1:30:54] the devil is one of the creation
[1:30:59] of is God who planned for him who put
[1:31:05] him in that place because he's got
[1:31:08] followers they will follow him to their
[1:31:15] doomed is God who prepared all those
[1:31:17] things so this morning whom are you
[1:31:20] going to
[1:31:21] BL if there's person to BL
[1:31:25] you caname
[1:31:26] God he the heart
[1:31:31] of made the prophet if you think he
[1:31:34] hasn't made you
[1:31:38] anything then can because God did
[1:31:43] everything we are just
[1:31:46] walking on the plan of
[1:31:49] God you know when you are a son in the
[1:31:54] you no long worry about the things of
[1:31:56] the of the world about even your own
[1:31:59] body but the only thing that you will

[1:32:17] man the spoken with spoken obey the
[1:32:21] voice of the angel

[1:32:28] name of
[1:32:30] Moses had him born in this
[1:32:33] world for that specific
[1:32:37] purpose to deliver the
[1:32:39] people that were in
[1:32:43] bondage that couldn't help
[1:32:46] themselves he brought them out in fact
[1:32:50] not
[1:32:51] Moses Moses never performed one
[1:32:55] Miracle it was the angel of
[1:32:58] God that went before

[1:33:04] fire at night and Loud by
[1:33:09] day amen amen that was Moses and is

[1:47:04] children of Israel Mana anymore but they
[1:47:07] did eat of the fruit of the land of
[1:47:10] Canan that year and it came to pass when
[1:47:13] Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up
[1:47:16] his eyes and looked and behold there
[1:47:19] stood a man over again him against him
[1:47:24] with his sword drawn in his hand and

[1:47:43] and did worship and said unto him what
[1:47:46] sayth my Lord unto his servant and the
[1:47:50] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[1:47:51] Joshua lose thy shoe from off thy feet
[1:47:55] for the place where on thou standest is
[1:47:58] Holy and Joshua did so amen God richly

[1:48:05] sees on the after they' eaten the
[1:48:12] land amen amen the Mana

[1:50:18] another brother or another sister it's
[1:50:21] when he's doing that
[1:50:23] in
[1:50:26] you brother said to
[1:50:29] us there was a day when he hear the
[1:50:33] voice from the cave from the cave from
[1:50:37] the river from the
[1:50:39] tree but he said the day I hear that way
[1:50:45] Within
[1:50:46] Myself I said Lord God you made it this
[1:50:51] is the most wonderful
[1:50:53] time because that voice from the tree

[1:51:06] is in me from today going forward I am
[1:51:11] God I am the voice of
[1:51:17] God maybe that's why God has visited him
[1:51:21] and revealed the unto him because he
[1:51:24] said one of the day here today to open
[1:51:27] the seals for
[1:51:30] God but the Bible says no one was worthy
[1:51:35] but we see
[1:51:38] brother open
[1:51:40] them we are the beneficiary
[1:51:46] today and time and time and you remember
[1:51:51] the man
[1:51:53] from that day until they entered into
[1:51:57] the promised land and the holy ghost
[1:52:01] that fell on the day of
[1:52:03] Pentecost will never cease falling on
[1:52:06] the
[1:52:07] T on the
[1:52:09] church will never Cee falling on the
[1:52:14] church till the
[1:52:18] Millennium Jesus come in power the old
[1:52:24] again if you notice as soon as they
[1:52:28] Cross
[1:52:29] Jordan me separation from the Earthly
[1:52:34] journey into the other
[1:52:37] land which was spiritual
[1:52:40] thing SE and they eat the old
[1:52:43] coin they eat of the fruit from the land
[1:52:47] again in the Millennium see we are
[1:52:51] eating spiritual manner
[1:52:54] but we'll be
[1:52:55] back won't need spiritual
[1:52:59] manner in that
[1:53:01] time we will eat the fruit of the vine
[1:53:06] again and of the filled the
[1:53:10] cor and the Bible says we will build
[1:53:15] houses and
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:20] inhabit plant vine yards amen plant
[1:53:25] vineard and eat the fruit of
[1:53:29] them when we come into the Millennium
[1:53:33] the Thousand Years of
[1:53:35] rest then will be Wars and trouble and
[1:53:38] sickness and
[1:53:41] death will flee from the
[1:53:43] world will return here on Earth on this
[1:53:47] Earth and be with Christ A Thousand
[1:53:50] Years
[1:53:52] right here before we go into the
[1:53:56] glory that is the teaching of the
[1:53:59] scripture now the children of Israel
[1:54:02] when they are in Canaan they were in the
[1:54:06] promised
[1:54:07] land promised land they have to be in
[1:54:11] their
[1:54:12] position they have to be in their
[1:54:15] purpose need to know their standpoint in
[1:54:18] the way they need to build houses
[1:54:22] they need to plant
[1:54:25] vineard and us in the
[1:54:28] Millennium it was exactly like that so
[1:54:31] when they were there they worked for it
[1:54:35] the ministry Chang the ministry has
[1:54:39] changed when the ministry has changed
[1:54:42] and you are part of the ministry you
[1:54:45] will start to
[1:54:46] realize something has happened we are in
[1:54:49] another level so you go with the
[1:54:56] amen amen you no longer worry what
[1:55:00] happen behind you no longer worry about
[1:55:03] what is happening with you but you are
[1:55:06] looking forward because you have been
[1:55:08] called for
[1:55:12] a do you know that there are certain
[1:55:16] people they were just born to
[1:55:20] complain and they doing doing it very
[1:55:23] nice even if you say nice things they
[1:55:26] will just complain and be negative and
[1:55:29] they started to realize that they were
[1:55:31] born for that because we never had them
[1:55:33] talking anything
[1:55:43] positive now I saw them my work premises
[1:55:45] I've
[1:55:46] seen if you see them stay there the
[1:55:49] corner if you do some presentation
[1:55:56] this one is just talking
[1:55:58] nonsense like I prepared for the whole
[1:56:04] night but this is becoming nonsense but
[1:56:07] okay say something
[1:56:10] good this one is just undering us that's
[1:56:14] when you realize and start to observe
[1:56:17] that
[1:56:18] individual he's just like that
[1:56:23] I wish there's none
[1:56:25] here the great warrior
[1:56:29] Joshua brother says now when Joshua was
[1:56:33] over there walking after the crossed
[1:56:35] over
[1:56:38] Jordan they start to to
[1:56:41] eat the
[1:56:45] Earth and I can imagine Joshua that
[1:56:49] morning after getting this great
[1:56:53] vision of the Lord saying I will be with
[1:56:58] you just like
[1:57:01] Moses so will I be with
[1:57:05] you called him one night and said now
[1:57:09] look Joshua give him a vision and say
[1:57:13] now my Serv Moses
[1:57:16] day rise and go over
[1:57:19] Jordan thou and all the of
[1:57:23] Israel and the Lord thy God will be
[1:57:27] you no man remember that no man shall
[1:57:33] stand before thee all the days of your
[1:57:37] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:57:41] with you only be good
[1:57:45] character just
[1:57:47] focus and do not be
[1:57:50] discouraged just keep on moving
[1:57:53] I will be with you every place you set
[1:57:57] the soul of your feet is a possession
[1:57:59] for
[1:58:03] you he if we were like Joshua this
[1:58:06] morning knowing that nothing can stand
[1:58:12] before we will have more courage and
[1:58:15] what I like about God
[1:58:17] said I will be with you but this this
[1:58:22] morning he will not be with us he will
[1:58:26] be in
[1:58:28] us if he's in us when we walk is him
[1:58:32] walking using our body we need to allow
[1:58:37] to be
[1:58:41] the above all the human
[1:58:44] race this is the most greatest
[1:58:49] age where God is Not with us where God
[1:58:54] is in
[1:58:56] US brother Bram say all the years I
[1:59:02] heard him I've seen the
[1:59:05] angel Paul Paul saw it but the moment I
[1:59:11] realized that this in me it was the
[1:59:14] closing of the
[1:59:19] chapter amen amen it is the rising of
[1:59:22] the sun spoken
[1:59:23] way Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:59:27] talking
[1:59:28] about it was a wave over the
[1:59:33] people and the first time they will come
[1:59:36] forth for the bright
[1:59:38] age for a
[1:59:41] resurrection out of dark
[1:59:44] denominationalism will be a
[1:59:46] message that the full maturity of the we
[1:59:52] has turned back
[1:59:54] again in its full
[1:59:56] power and being waved over the
[2:00:00] People by the same
[2:00:02] sign and
[2:00:05] wonders that he did back
[2:00:08] then now the spoken with more events
[2:00:12] made clear by prophecy the man of God
[2:00:15] says we are not living in Pentecostal
[2:00:19] age we are living in another
[2:00:22] AG we are not living in a method this
[2:00:26] church we are living in another age we
[2:00:30] are living on up to the bright
[2:00:34] age the calling out of the
[2:00:37] church and getting it
[2:00:40] together for the Rapture that's the
[2:00:43] great
[2:00:44] age that we are living in to my honest
[2:00:48] opinion that exactly the truth
[2:00:53] the man of God is putting an assurance
[2:00:55] to
[2:00:56] you that the AG came and
[2:00:59] passed they came and passed but we know
[2:01:03] until laudation
[2:01:05] church and church age was the age of
[2:01:12] Pentecostalism but the age we are living
[2:01:14] in is the bright age the bright age
[2:01:18] means of everything
[2:01:22] anytime we will be
[2:01:29] gone amen amen I like the game when the
[2:01:33] pastor say we are on the
[2:01:38] runway amen amen when you are on the
[2:01:41] runway that plane does not have a
[2:01:47] reverse even if you can say I love
[2:01:52] something and this and this you are on
[2:01:55] the runway it goes we are in that plane
[2:02:00] we are going beyond the sky you remember
[2:02:05] brother when he was saying when the tube
[2:02:09] of the
[2:02:11] astronauts going up once it's shoot up
[2:02:15] there's no RSE
[2:02:17] because we have hit the point of no
[2:02:21] return
[2:02:23] when someone is dying when someone is
[2:02:26] dying he hit the point of not
[2:02:28] return you started to realize that you
[2:02:32] are no longer going back you are going
[2:02:34] forward if you are sinner you cannot
[2:02:38] come back to this life again before you
[2:02:41] die there will be that moment that you
[2:02:45] cannot change it's happening before your
[2:02:49] departure even if you like to
[2:02:52] you will never return back to to life
[2:02:55] again because you have hit the point of
[2:02:58] no
[2:02:59] return at the moment the pyramid has
[2:03:02] gone
[2:03:03] up and there is a point of no
[2:03:06] return the Bible the last chapter of
[2:03:10] Revelation
[2:03:11] say the children of God Will Remain the
[2:03:15] children of
[2:03:16] God will remain a sen a holy one will
[2:03:21] remain a one an evil one an evil one
[2:03:25] will remain an evil one that is this
[2:03:28] time we are
[2:03:30] living amen whereby we are already
[2:03:34] hooked
[2:03:36] in when you are inside you no longer
[2:03:40] listen to what the people says
[2:03:43] outside you have seen your
