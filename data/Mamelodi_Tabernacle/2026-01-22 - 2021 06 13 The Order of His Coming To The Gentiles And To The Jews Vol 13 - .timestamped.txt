[31:57] We now want to welcome our precious
[31:59] pastor
[32:01] to take the phone.
[32:03] So I'm going to ask the worship team to
[32:07] sing that special song as we welcome our
[32:10] precious pastor. God bless you.
[32:26] Remember
[32:48] that song is for the past.
[32:51] So let's wait for him to come.
[32:56] Amen. H a pastor read an invitation to
[33:02] DRC.
[33:06] I believe it was last week.
[33:10] Pastor Salm
[33:12] says if there's anyone that is going to
[33:15] accompany the pastor is welcome
[33:18] but then you need to send me the names
[33:21] so that they can prepare the invitation
[33:24] specifically tailored accordingly.
[33:29] Hallelujah.
[33:31] Amen.
[33:33] Now just to inform you
[33:37] uh in DRC
[33:40] before you travel to DRC
[33:43] you need to take a COVID test here in
[33:45] South Africa
[33:47] and on arrival in DRC
[33:51] you are going to pay $50
[33:54] for the COVID test.
[33:57] So you do it here in South Africa. You
[34:00] do it on arrival
[34:06] and
[34:08] also there's charges for airport tax
[34:13] about $100 that you need to pay. So if
[34:18] you're going to accompany the pastor,
[34:19] you need to know that you need to have
[34:22] about $200.
[34:24] $100 is for airport tax. $50 is for
[34:28] COVID test in entering DRC. Another $50
[34:33] for COVID test to exit DRC.
[34:37] And they also need a yellow card.
[34:41] May the Lord richly bless you.

[35:48] before the pastor comes in and on
[35:51] arrival we will sing a special song for
[35:54] the past. God bless you.

[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] you know
[41:13] just
[41:15] I I think it has been three weeks now
[41:21] thinking of visiting the
[41:24] the the singers here
[41:31] to introduce to them this song behold
[41:34] I'll send you Elijah so that for them to
[41:37] arrange it
[41:43] But God had me. Amen.
[41:49] Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; But in the days,
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; of the voice.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And
[41:59] now I'm living in the days
[42:03] &gt;&gt; of that manifested voice of God.
[42:10] Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Now, that's why when we sing these songs
[42:15] to me, it's not just a song.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; It's a manifestation of
[42:22] &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice
[42:25] of the seventh angel.
[42:30] Thank you. Thank you.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[42:34] Yeah. Yeah. Carry on doing that.
[42:37] Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Now our
[42:40] welcome welcome has changed.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Welcome.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; It has taken another form now.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not,
[42:56] we are here to worship God.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Your hatred won't work.
[43:09] All those who are here are here to
[43:12] worship.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "Forgive one
[43:19] another
[43:21] and worship God.
[43:30] If you want to go there
[43:31] &gt;&gt; today at the end of the service,
[43:36] You stand right here.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; And
[43:43] repent.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Uh
[43:55] for being the Let me read you some
[43:59] things before I sit down. There is
[44:02] something here.
[44:05] I will tell you why we worship
[44:14] in the way we worship.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Shall I read it to you? Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You forgive me. Sometimes I will
[44:24] pick up a book and try to read and
[44:27] because of my uh
[44:32] my my
[44:35] mind
[44:38] fast. My mind is so fast. Sometimes I
[44:42] try to read something
[44:46] and I will miss it.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And yet it is in the book.
[44:52] Amen. But still I will miss it
[44:55] &gt;&gt; because of my mind running too fast.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; But be just before we sit down.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Uh I will read you something here.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Um
[45:15] the prophet speaks here.
[45:18] He says,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; "The reason I don't believe
[45:24] this is something we missed last time."
[45:28] &gt;&gt; You could see I was running through the
[45:30] book trying to read this same thing I'm
[45:33] reading to you right now
[45:38] because I owe you. I'm I'm reading it
[45:41] now.
[45:43] Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; That's the reason that is smile smiling
[45:49] church age page 210.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I don't believe that
[45:56] there is an eternal hell.
[46:02] There cannot be an eternal hell. Cuz if
[46:05] there ever was an eternal hell, then
[46:08] there always was an eternal hell.
[46:19] Because there is only one form of
[46:22] eternal life and that's what we all
[46:25] striving for.
[46:32] Amen.
[46:34] That's why I'm not striving
[46:36] uh for
[46:39] like a thing of striving for the people
[46:43] to love me or to walk with me. I'm
[46:46] striving for eternal life.
[46:54] Amen. Amen. And uh there's only one form
[47:00] of eternal life. That's what we all are
[47:03] striving for
[47:09] because it's either eternal life or a
[47:11] hell.
[47:14] Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Now,
[47:20] how can I be waiting for things that I
[47:23] know they will come to the end? They
[47:25] will pass away.
[47:33] Okay, think deep.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Can you work for something that you know
[47:39] exactly that it's not eternal and it it
[47:43] it will pass away.
[47:50] Even the Bible says heaven and earth
[47:54] shall pass away.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And John say I saw new heaven and
[48:02] a new earth.
[48:05] Therefore because the former one has
[48:07] passed away.
[48:10] Now we are living here in the former one
[48:15] which shall pass
[48:17] away.
[48:19] When you if even if you can say to me,
[48:23] I give you 10 billion randsion,
[48:28] &gt;&gt; but they shall pass away.
[48:30] Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Do you think I will enjoy them?
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Because I'm looking at the end
[48:38] of of that 10 billion.
[48:42] If you are looking at a man, you are
[48:45] actually looking at the body of a man.
[48:49] You are actually looking at the end
[48:52] because this body shall rot in the
[48:54] grave.
[48:57] You are just looking at the end of that
[48:59] person.
[49:02] He can be rich and boast and be whatever
[49:06] but you are looking at the end of it.
[49:11] Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I can't embrace the
[49:17] things of this world.
[49:21] Because every time I pick up this thing,
[49:26] I'm picking up the thing at its last
[49:30] breath.
[49:33] Okay. Amen.
[49:38] And but there's the wonder of it all.
[49:44] While I'm saying this,
[49:47] somebody still holding
[49:50] to something
[49:52] that is slipping out of his hand
[49:57] because that thing shall pass away
[50:01] and the world shall pass away.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Demons shall pass away.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Riches shall pass away.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Your mind
[50:17] shall pass away.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That's why I can't rely on my mind
[50:25] because I'm looking at these things.
[50:29] I'm looking at the things that are
[50:31] passing away.
[50:34] Heaven and earth
[50:36] shall pass away.
[50:39] and says,
[50:42] &gt;&gt; "Behold,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; I make all things new,
[50:48] the book of Revelation."
[50:51] Okay,
[50:53] but I was saying this, this is a thing
[50:56] that last I was trying to read to you
[50:59] and it just slipped off my mind.
[51:04] Um,
[51:05] it says
[51:07] &gt;&gt; now there's no burning hell.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; You can't have eternal hell.
[51:16] Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Don't rejoice and say
[51:26] the prophet says don't go there.
[51:32] You've seen terrible things,
[51:35] but don't go to hell.
[51:37] Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; You have seen terrible and terrible
[51:40] things,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; but then don't go to the tribulation
[51:45] period.
[51:48] Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Because he says hell can be there even
[51:52] for millions of years or so forth, but
[51:55] it will eventually pass away.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] It
[52:05] it can be around for eternal
[52:11] eternity.
[52:13] Now let me finish.
[52:16] Hell was created.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; That's why it has no eternal life.
[52:23] And if it's created, it is in eternal.
[52:28] Anything that's eternal never was
[52:32] created.
[52:37] I I believe somebody's listening.
[52:41] Amen.
[52:43] Then one can stand up and say I was
[52:45] created by God.
[52:49] Anything
[52:52] that's
[52:54] eternal never was created.
[53:00] That's why my soul was not created.
[53:05] Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; It always was. It's eternal.
[53:13] Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says hell was created for
[53:19] the devil and his angels.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Hell was created.
[53:26] It is in eternal.
[53:29] Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And then
[53:34] we can read on and on and on and on.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; But
[53:39] that's it. Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Now we are going to read the scripture
[53:44] of today
[53:46] and I believe God will be with us
[53:51] and for
[53:53] for this moment
[53:57] Okay.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Before we ask
[54:04] one of our brothers to
[54:10] or my son is here to just for the word.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to
[54:16] as we bow our heads
[54:22] in him there is no failure.
[54:29] In him
[54:32] there is
[54:34] no
[54:40] ine.
[54:42] There is
[54:45] no faith.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; In him there is no favor.
[55:03] There is no faith.
[55:15] There is no
[55:24] there is no so.
[55:41] Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:03:40] We only know the song.
[1:03:44] Let's turn our Bibles to our Bibles.
[1:03:48] Let us just read today. Let me read two
[1:03:52] books. Revelation chapter 12 verse 4.
[1:03:59] 12:4.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll start with that one
[1:04:06] and we'll turn to we are still just
[1:04:09] around
[1:04:11] the throne room.
[1:04:15] Amen.
[1:04:19] Amen. Amen. I don't want to start

[1:04:35] dance around.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; So that's why I want to read about the
[1:04:39] song and after this we are still going
[1:04:43] uh to look at some things because for us
[1:04:47] to arrive at the throne is after
[1:04:52] overcoming.
[1:04:59] Then we'll take you
[1:05:02] back
[1:05:04] to show how we arrived where we are
[1:05:10] because we are beyond
[1:05:12] the seven church ages.
[1:05:17] Verse 20 says chapter 20 verse4
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and I saw thrones. Now it's not now this
[1:05:26] time is not throne but thrones.
[1:05:31] And they sat upon them and judgment was
[1:05:34] given unto them. I and I saw the souls
[1:05:38] of them that were beheaded for the
[1:05:42] witness of Jesus and for the word of God
[1:05:46] and which had not worshiped the beast,
[1:05:50] neither his image, neither had received
[1:05:55] his mark upon their foreheads for in
[1:05:58] their hand or in their hands. and they
[1:06:03] lived and reign with Christ a thousand
[1:06:07] years.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Can you identify them?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord said, "You shall sit on
[1:06:19] how many thrones?"
[1:06:21] Oh,
[1:06:23] we were reading yesterday, brother
[1:06:25] harvest.
[1:06:27] You read it yesterday.
[1:06:30] Amen.
[1:06:36] read it.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; The church don't know about those
[1:06:40] thrones.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:06:45] Otherwise,
[1:06:48] 12 thrones.
[1:06:50] Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You are reading it last night, I think.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Have you forgotten?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:01] 27
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; chapter
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; 19th chapter
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Matthews

[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; then teacher and said unto him behold we
[1:07:12] have forsaken all and followed me what
[1:07:15] shall we have therefore
[1:07:18] and Jesus said unto them verily I say
[1:07:21] unto you that he which shall follow me
[1:07:24] in the regeneration when the son of man
[1:07:28] shall sit in the throne of his glory. He
[1:07:31] also shall sit upon 12
[1:07:35] tribes of Israel.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; We will come to that throne. The Jewish.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; The Jews will be judged by the Jews.
[1:07:49] The Gentiles shall be judged by the
[1:07:51] Gentiles.
[1:07:56] Amen. Amen. The Jews shall be judged by
[1:08:01] the Jews.
[1:08:03] The Gentiles shall be judged by the
[1:08:06] Gentiles.
[1:08:08] It is in your Bible.
[1:08:11] But let's follow these things
[1:08:15] because it is the end of the whole
[1:08:17] thing.
[1:08:19] Okay. Amen. Now we have here again.
[1:08:24] Now this is for the Gentiles.
[1:08:27] Verse 11. Verse 11.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And I saw a great white throne. Now, not
[1:08:33] thrones.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Because for the Jews, it says on on how
[1:08:40] many thrones?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; 12.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And he shall judge.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Because even the gates there 12 12.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that is Jewish because the
[1:08:56] prophet says
[1:09:00] the roots
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; is Jewish.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; For the Bible Ephesians says
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; for for we are built upon
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; the foundation
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; the foundation of the
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; prophets
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; and apostles.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why if you go to the new
[1:09:22] Jerusalem,
[1:09:24] you'll realize
[1:09:27] Thank you, brother.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Have you prophesied that I'm getting
[1:09:34] I'm bending here.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:41] Well, this is not part of preaching. But
[1:09:44] if the month is June or July, it doesn't
[1:09:46] mean that even if the sun is out and
[1:09:50] burning, but because it's winter, you
[1:09:53] should switch on the game
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; because some go to sleep.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Don't sleep, my friends. Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Around the throne.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:09] But I saw a great white throne and him
[1:10:12] that sat on it from
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Now you can see the difference.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You see the difference because that one
[1:10:22] is thrones 12.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; This one is throne.
[1:10:28] Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I want us to you you may take
[1:10:34] your seat.
[1:10:36] Now I want to go back again a bit
[1:10:42] uh something uh so wonderful here
[1:10:47] and I want us to read it.
[1:10:52] I don't know if these things were packed
[1:10:54] together.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now I've got to
[1:11:01] look around. I don't know how the
[1:11:04] brother packed them here.
[1:11:08] And then
[1:11:11] okay, hold on.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; I'm still It is the brother who packed
[1:11:16] these things for me last night,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; but it seems as if not packed away.
[1:11:26] I would have loved them to be packed
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; otherwise.
[1:11:33] Amen. We have read the word of God.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my look at this.
[1:11:41] Uh and the brother is not here. But
[1:11:45] let me not give in or give up.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Let us
[1:11:52] I will start here again.
[1:11:56] Now this part that we are going to read
[1:12:01] uh all the things scriptures that are
[1:12:05] being read here
[1:12:09] they are it's an they are indicating to
[1:12:12] us that we are on our way back home.
[1:12:18] We're not talking about
[1:12:22] we are not talking about the past here.
[1:12:25] We are talking about the things that are
[1:12:28] coming.
[1:12:31] Why? Because they are coming
[1:12:34] immediately.
[1:12:40] Uh we are already in
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; those that are
[1:12:46] in are going shall be taken in the
[1:12:49] rapture.
[1:12:53] They are already in that zone.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; And I told a brother
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; that you see this lockdown
[1:13:06] has
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; shown us
[1:13:12] a a church goer
[1:13:14] and a predestinated son or daughter of
[1:13:18] God.
[1:13:25] All right. Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Until some people said mocking
[1:13:31] mockingly, they said,
[1:13:37] "Oh, these days, you know, go to
[1:13:39] fellowship in
[1:13:42] the Bible said they shall come
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and they shall mock us."
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; All right. They mocked the Lord Jesus
[1:13:51] Christ
[1:13:53] even when he was on the cross.
[1:13:56] They continued to mock him.
[1:14:00] Now we are who who are we?
[1:14:03] If they mocked your masterly
[1:14:07] they will mock you.
[1:14:11] If you they mock your master
[1:14:15] and said you you are trying to be God.
[1:14:20] Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Are they not going to do the same thing
[1:14:25] to us?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm not offended if you say to me,
[1:14:32] brother, you are trying to be God.
[1:14:38] Why?
[1:14:40] God
[1:14:42] came and became us.
[1:14:47] Amen. And it is God who said, "Let us
[1:14:50] make men in our image,
[1:14:55] now a person who was made in the image
[1:14:57] of God
[1:15:00] has that desire
[1:15:02] always to be like him
[1:15:06] because he was made in his."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; What is the bride of Christ?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay sister, worship him.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; If you are made in the image of God,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; there is a desire in you to be like him.
[1:15:32] Amen. Amen. And the prophet came the
[1:15:35] seventh angel messenger.
[1:15:39] You read blasphemous names.
[1:15:43] He says, "The sons of God
[1:15:47] will be God's."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen."
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; How that's how it is with God.
[1:15:59] Then again in your book adoption,
[1:16:04] then he says,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; "You
[1:16:10] you know the scripture I mean the
[1:16:13] quotation that we read it time and again
[1:16:17] it's killing one and giving life to one
[1:16:21] because if I say to you brother
[1:16:25] uh you are an amasha god
[1:16:28] if you are
[1:16:31] you say
[1:16:34] amen that's what you are
[1:16:39] amen Amen. Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; All right, let's leave it there. That's
[1:16:44] why
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; it's Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen to the word
[1:16:49] of God because this is who you are.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; The angel said,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; "Oh, Jacob,
[1:17:05] but that's what you are.
[1:17:08] But Israel
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; is who you are.
[1:17:13] Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Now there's difference be between what
[1:17:16] you are and who you are.
[1:17:22] Amen. You are the word of God.
[1:17:26] That's who you are.
[1:17:28] Amen. Do you know that? Now let's take
[1:17:32] this.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[1:17:38] This thing is wonderful.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; You know these days I love this book.
[1:17:43] Future home of the
[1:17:46] future of what is it? Future home.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Where is it brother?
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes when I do things I
[1:17:57] peg them them myself because I pick him
[1:18:00] for somebody next time he finds that
[1:18:02] brother. We were in Switzerland
[1:18:05] then he said look at that wife now. one
[1:18:07] shoe.
[1:18:10] This I find one shoe here.
[1:18:15] It's not
[1:18:18] pale
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; and that the socks also mixed up here.
[1:18:24] I I I said brother you pack your things
[1:18:28] for yourself
[1:18:32] otherwise you'll find because
[1:18:35] she knows to pack her things
[1:18:39] but not yours
[1:18:48] brothers I'm not messing things up for
[1:18:50] you that you know you sometimes ask mama
[1:18:51] please do it for I I pull my trolley and
[1:18:55] pack things for myself
[1:18:59] so that when I arrive
[1:19:02] in Congo or Switzerland,
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I won't blame somebody.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's not a good thing. Do it yourself.
[1:19:20] You know, I thought we
[1:19:34] The Bible says she is your
[1:19:37] help.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:19:43] In in which way
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; in taking for you?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; What I today? Let's leave it today.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; We'll bring it.
[1:19:56] Now listen. Last week we were on
[1:19:59] something very important.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of God
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; is with men.
[1:20:14] You know, you must watch these things.
[1:20:19] When brother Brennham was preaching
[1:20:21] there
[1:20:23] and he said, "I went back to the
[1:20:27] tabernacle."
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Was it to the tabernacle?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I came back to the earth
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; to reveal
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; these things.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And you remember
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; it's not tabernacle
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; but the the tabernacle he went back to
[1:20:47] reveal the things to
[1:20:51] was the body.
[1:20:54] Amen.
[1:20:56] It is the bride of Christ
[1:20:59] because when he came back from
[1:21:03] meeting the angels message,
[1:21:08] he came to the bride.
[1:21:10] Amen. Amen. Not
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; to the bride
[1:21:18] of Christ.
[1:21:21] That's why sometimes the people would
[1:21:22] rush to Brenham.
[1:21:26] and saying, "Brother Brennham said, I
[1:21:29] came back to reveal them."
[1:21:35] Not knowing that to reveal them to the
[1:21:38] tabernacle, the bride of Christ.
[1:21:42] That's why this morning we are enjoying
[1:21:44] these things.
[1:21:46] We are the tabernacle.
[1:21:51] Amen. and the whole
[1:21:54] parts of this tabernacle
[1:21:58] everywhere you go to California,
[1:22:02] you go to Zambia,
[1:22:04] you go to Tanzania, you go to Malawi,
[1:22:08] they all in one voice. Ah, amen.
[1:22:13] That is the tabernacle of God.
[1:22:17] entire tabernacle of God. It's it's
[1:22:20] Malawi, South Africa.
[1:22:23] Hallelujah. As I'm preaching here,
[1:22:26] I'm greeting also Tanzania.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I'm greeting Malawi.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I'm greeting
[1:22:36] California.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That's the tabernacle of God.
[1:22:42] Now, let's look at it a bit.
[1:22:45] All right.
[1:22:46] Um
[1:22:48] uh um if I were preaching to mommy
[1:22:54] I it would be different.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; But if I'm preaching to the board the
[1:23:01] entire body of God
[1:23:05] you'll hear that
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; it will be different
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; from just taking upon mood.
[1:23:17] maybe
[1:23:20] uh there it's two people
[1:23:25] you never know.
[1:23:27] Now if you intend to preaching to mommy
[1:23:30] Lord
[1:23:32] you maybe you are preaching to two
[1:23:33] people
[1:23:35] or one or three.
[1:23:38] Now the message is not the mood message
[1:23:44] is the message to the entire body of
[1:23:46] God.
[1:23:50] Pastor Fredding Congo knows that
[1:23:55] okay let us look at it. Future home
[1:24:00] page 3. You don't have future home. Let
[1:24:03] me help you here.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Page 35.
[1:24:09] Now, I I I want you to
[1:24:13] to hear this because
[1:24:19] I'm not going to take long time,
[1:24:22] but because I'm still looking to some
[1:24:24] other things.
[1:24:26] Heaven and earth
[1:24:29] have met.
[1:24:32] Amen. Amen. Now you'll say yeah no last
[1:24:36] week he also uh said things like this
[1:24:39] but now you listen it's not last week
[1:24:42] today
[1:24:47] let us see the earth the new earth
[1:24:52] and the new heaven
[1:24:54] let us see them embracing
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] coming together
[1:25:03] until there will be no more a prayer of
[1:25:07] that kind. Our father in heaven.
[1:25:13] Amen. Now you listen here, you will
[1:25:15] realize that
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; the one whom we loved
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; and uh we we we we've been wanting to
[1:25:29] meet him
[1:25:32] in his corporal body.
[1:25:36] We we we we will very very very soon
[1:25:39] meet him.
[1:25:42] Amen. in his corporate building.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's why they say
[1:25:52] that's why they say come let's go to
[1:25:55] heaven so that we can see his cars.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Now this is very important part.
[1:26:01] Heaven and earth have met.
[1:26:05] Amen. Now it says, "Behold
[1:26:13] the new heaven and the new
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; earth."
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, friends.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:26:26] 21. Revelation chapter 21.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation 21.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] Now

[1:26:41] what do you call it the thing that you
[1:26:43] used to jot verses and what script

[1:26:52] is not from CNA
[1:26:56] it is in my heart
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I catch it from God
[1:27:04] in my heart.
[1:27:06] Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Because uh if it's a a booklet like
[1:27:12] Amen,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; you they I've seen them writing like
[1:27:15] this
[1:27:17] until you using it as a pillow.
[1:27:23] Now the best one is in the heart.
[1:27:28] Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] But God bless you
[1:27:33] for for coming with your books,
[1:27:37] notebooks.
[1:27:39] It shows that you are so much concerned
[1:27:41] with the word of God.
[1:27:44] You want to put it in your heart
[1:27:48] and also in your booklets.
[1:27:53] Unless a person who comes without a
[1:27:55] Bible.
[1:27:57] Have you ever a soldier going to war,
[1:28:01] without a gun?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Just like this going to war
[1:28:09] and and the enemy is coming
[1:28:11] with the guns and
[1:28:16] what what what do you call that? the
[1:28:19] machine guns and the bombs and
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; this thing of Russia. What do you call
[1:28:25] it? EMP.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; EMP.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; And you come folding your
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; When the captain says fireaptain.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:44] All right.
[1:28:47] The Bible told me about the
[1:28:52] the
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; arament.
[1:28:58] Yeah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It is put on.
[1:29:02] Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; You remind me the whole life.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Don't go there barefooted. Put on
[1:29:13] from the head to your toes.
[1:29:17] Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; maybe next week we'll say
[1:29:27] the pastor is shouting at us saying we
[1:29:29] must bring our Bibles.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That still won't work.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; It should not be the pastor
[1:29:38] push you to carry your Bible.
[1:29:41] It should be your heart,
[1:29:44] your soul, not if it is the pastor, then
[1:29:48] you'll just come and put it in front of
[1:29:50] you.
[1:30:04] It says, "And I saw a new heaven and a
[1:30:09] new earth
[1:30:11] that's chapter 21
[1:33:36] He is in his body.
[1:33:40] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; That is the tabernacle of God
[1:33:43] is with men.
[1:33:46] That means Jesus is in a body
[1:33:50] working with men.
[1:33:54] That is what is coming.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And we come and meet him here in the
[1:34:00] tabernacle
[1:34:03] spiritually.
[1:34:05] Amen. To worship and honor him.
[1:34:09] But we are going to meet him
[1:34:12] in his body.
[1:34:15] And when we shall
[1:34:20] let us go to heaven.
[1:34:25] The heaven that we are going to is
[1:34:27] immov.
[1:34:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That is coming.
[1:34:54] Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And is is short coming
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; and every breath
[1:35:02] every second.
[1:35:05] Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; To meet like a clock
[1:35:09] because he is coming very very soon.
[1:35:14] Amen. If you are a child of God, if you
[1:35:17] are predestinated,
[1:35:20] you can even hear within yourself
[1:35:24] that he is coming very soon.
[1:35:27] So he is even so close to us
[1:35:32] in his body.
[1:35:37] Now look at the difference.
[1:35:42] Today he is with us
[1:35:47] and we are a body.
[1:35:50] He is spiritually with us.
[1:35:54] But that day that is coming,
[1:35:57] he will be with us.
[1:36:01] Amen. Amen. He will be in a body.
[1:36:06] While I'm in a body,
[1:36:10] the body that is to come.
[1:36:14] Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; That's why they sing. It's going to be
[1:36:20] wonderful. It's going to be wonderful.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. In heaven.
[1:36:24] And
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; when we meet
[1:36:26] and the holy saints.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not I'm talking about this.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice.
[1:36:39] out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[1:36:42] tabernacle of God is with me,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; and he will dwell with
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; with them."
[1:36:54] Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Even now we say that he is walking with
[1:37:00] us.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; This is spiritually.
[1:37:04] But now when he the tabernacle God will
[1:37:07] will be with us
[1:37:11] and he will dwell
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; with with us.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Now there's difference between he will
[1:37:23] dwell in us and he will dwell with us.
[1:37:30] Right now he is in us.
[1:37:34] as he said that day you shall know that
[1:37:36] I am in you
[1:37:40] but from being in us
[1:37:43] then it says now he will dwell with us
[1:37:49] he also being in a body
[1:37:52] and we right now he's not in a body
[1:37:56] he is in a body his wife
[1:38:00] but he will come when he is in his
[1:38:02] individual body
[1:38:05] and we also in the bodies.
[1:38:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Looking at him, his face.
[1:38:14] Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you'll recognize him.
[1:38:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; That's why now we are striving
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; not to be known of men,
[1:38:29] not to get millions,
[1:38:31] but to see him.
[1:38:34] Amen. That
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; that's in our heart
[1:38:38] because if you are predestinated,
[1:38:40] you were born to meet him.
[1:38:43] You are born to see him.
[1:38:46] You are born to love him.
[1:38:49] You are born to serve him
[1:38:52] because you are predestinated
[1:38:55] to see him, to love him. Amen. Amen. To
[1:38:59] be indwelled by him.
[1:39:04] He says, "Yes, Jesus."
[1:39:08] Amen.
[1:39:10] Dwell in me. Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody's blessed.
[1:39:16] Amen. And I heard a great voice
[1:39:21] out of heaven saying, "Behold,
[1:39:25] the tabernacle of God is with me,
[1:39:28] and he will dwell with them,
[1:39:31] and they shall be his people
[1:39:34] and God himself,
[1:39:38] not the Holy Ghost now, God himself."
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we shall see him, look at him
[1:39:49] and God himself
[1:39:55] shall be with them
[1:39:57] and be with their God. The Bible here is
[1:40:02] trying to emphasize on these things
[1:40:06] that that's when God and men
[1:40:10] shall meet.
[1:40:13] Amen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It's really
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; putting that in us
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; to our comfort.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Verse four.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Verse four.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And God shall wipe away their tears from
[1:40:30] their eyes. And there shall be no more
[1:40:33] death, bye-bye death, neither sorrow
[1:40:38] nor crying.
[1:40:41] Never shall there be any more pain.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; For the
[1:40:49] You can say to the chemist, bye-bye.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Bye-bye. Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to the pharmacy.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to hospital.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Bye-bye to ambulance.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Ambulance. Bye-bye.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; That's not the land of ambulances.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; That's not the land of pain.
[1:41:10] No sorrow.
[1:41:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That's where we are going.
[1:41:18] Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; That's why it says
[1:41:22] they look back to the world they used to
[1:41:25] be.
[1:41:28] Amen. They have seen a better country.
[1:41:34] Can you keep the old one if you have
[1:41:37] seen the new one?
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:43] You buy new shoes
[1:41:46] and you do away with the old ones.
[1:41:51] You receive Jesus.
[1:41:54] You do away with the religions of the
[1:41:56] world.
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; The old stuff.
[1:42:02] Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Put on the new man. He says,
[1:42:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Put off
[1:42:12] the old man.
[1:42:15] Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's why he says
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; the old water shall pass away.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; He will put it off.
[1:42:24] Amen. And
[1:42:27] shall bring forth the new one.
[1:42:30] for the new people,
[1:42:34] for the new bodies,
[1:42:36] for the new mind,
[1:42:39] for the new souls.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; For brother Brennham says
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; speaks of the new soul.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Now this new soul
[1:42:52] is the word of God
[1:42:55] to you.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's new soul.
[1:42:59] the old things have passed
[1:43:03] away.
[1:43:05] He told me one time saying,
[1:43:08] "If you haven't married a good wife,
[1:43:13] did you hear the prophet say
[1:43:16] or if you haven't found a good one,
[1:43:21] you'll find one?"
[1:43:24] Because he says, "I make all things new.
[1:43:31] Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Comfort in somebody.
[1:43:35] If I want to comfort somebody who comes
[1:43:38] and say, "Hey, my wife, brother,
[1:43:43] she's like problem,
[1:43:46] you know, I can't even sleep."
[1:43:49] I said, "Don't worry, brother.
[1:43:51] Follow the prophet."
[1:43:53] He says if you you haven't got a good
[1:43:58] one,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; you will you are still going to get a
[1:44:01] good one.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say drop this one.
[1:44:12] Leave it like that.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I told a brother
[1:44:19] what what must I do now?
[1:44:23] You know, even every time I knock off my
[1:44:25] duty,
[1:44:28] thinking of going back to that woman,
[1:44:32] brother,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; don't you worry,
[1:44:36] go to your house.
[1:44:39] Amen. Amen. Remain with your family.
[1:44:44] He said, "What must I do?"
[1:44:47] I said, "What you should do?
[1:44:52] is to live
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; and let live leave.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus is greater than your wife
[1:45:04] to your life,
[1:45:06] your life.
[1:45:08] If you love even your mother more than
[1:45:11] your him,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; what did he say?
[1:45:20] He comes first.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; He's the first in everything.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; You know today, every time a child maybe
[1:45:33] comes to age,
[1:45:38] we will take the Bible and put it there
[1:45:42] and sit down and say, "Mama, come let us
[1:45:45] plan for the future of this child.
[1:45:51] And the Bible says you never say
[1:45:54] tomorrow I will do this and that
[1:45:58] is God.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; But naturally today the people will say
[1:46:05] let us plan for the future of this
[1:46:07] child.
[1:46:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; One says I want her to be this the other
[1:46:13] want to be that.
[1:46:15] But I will always say
[1:46:17] I want her or him to be a Christian.
[1:46:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; In this and that and that
[1:46:29] you will fail.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; But in Christ
[1:46:35] come
[1:46:40] a
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; he will survive. He will still
[1:46:45] be in the hands of the Almighty.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Put yourself your your child
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:46:59] Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Not inst.

[1:47:22] when I'm asking
[1:47:28] brotherh.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Let me find somebody.
[1:47:44] You call it astral
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; projection.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; What is this where
[1:48:01] they are afraid of saying because
[1:48:05] they in there?
[1:48:08] Mhm.

[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I should you should put your marriage in
[1:48:32] Christ.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there can be a show
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; and they put Christ here, they put
[1:48:44] Instagram here,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; name them,
[1:48:49] Facebook
[1:48:52] and say, "All right, all right."
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; The married people,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; where would you love to put your
[1:49:00] marriage?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Surely I will say in Jesus.

[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; The name I know.
[1:49:12] Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; He's got the whole world
[1:49:17] in his hands.
[1:49:19] Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; They took the rod of Aaron,
[1:49:24] put it in the holiest
[1:49:28] and it blossomed.
[1:49:31] Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Not because he watered it, he done
[1:49:35] this, but because it was in the holiest,
[1:49:42] you can put anything in the holiest,
[1:49:46] it will bloom.
[1:49:48] Put your child in the holiest,
[1:49:51] she will blossom.
[1:49:53] Amen. Amen. Put her in the Instagram,
[1:49:57] she will die.
[1:50:00] Amen. Because
[1:50:04] Satan,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; knows where to
[1:50:08] pluck
[1:50:10] a tree called in Instagram. What what
[1:50:14] name them Instagram, Facebook almost the
[1:50:18] whole world is in
[1:50:21] whether they are in the message
[1:50:23] or they are in there.
[1:50:28] Don't put me there please.
[1:50:31] I belong to Jesus.
[1:50:34] If you want to bless me, put me in
[1:50:38] Christ
[1:50:40] because I know there
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I shall bloom.
[1:50:45] Amen spiritually
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; for my attire
[1:50:51] natural attire.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I don't go to Instagram
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; or to whatever
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; to see
[1:51:01] I just go to shop
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; to wear because I can't walk naked.
[1:51:21] They had problems of standing before a
[1:51:23] mirror
[1:51:27] as you've got today. We've got the
[1:51:29] problems
[1:51:32] standing before the mirror
[1:51:35] because in my in our mind
[1:51:38] we want the people to see us not God.
[1:51:44] Have you seen that before the mirror
[1:51:48] doing this?
[1:51:51] How do I appear? How shall I appear
[1:51:54] before the people?
[1:51:56] I want to appear before God. And the
[1:52:00] Bible says we shall all appear before
[1:52:03] him.
[1:52:06] Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You don't I know that when we appear
[1:52:12] before him,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; he never said,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; "I give you 60 points."
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; 60 points.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. When we appear, as Paul says,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; we shall all appear before him.
[1:52:35] If I appear before the Instagram
[1:52:40] and in a way that
[1:52:43] I may dressed up,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; they give me maybe
[1:52:51] 100
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; points.
[1:52:54] Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And I get puffed up
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; to make it 200 points. 200 points.
[1:53:05] But we want to appear before him.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And when we appear,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; he will say,
[1:53:17] "You are the same with me."
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Oh, I I I think I
[1:53:24] I don't Do I have the book?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; We are We are blessed today." Here's the
[1:53:31] book here. Listen,
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; although I was going to read something
[1:53:36] out of it for something,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; but it reminds me here
[1:53:41] when God was creating, I'm coming back
[1:53:43] to you again.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe this time we will catch up with
[1:53:48] it.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; When God was creating,
[1:53:52] you know, in creating,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; God didn't look at something and say,
[1:53:58] "Yeah, let let me make this one like
[1:54:01] that one."
[1:54:04] No, he looked to himself.
[1:54:07] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He looked to
[1:54:10] himself
[1:54:12] and said, "Let us make men in our
[1:54:13] image."
[1:54:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. We today we can't dress
[1:54:21] unless we look at somebody first
[1:54:25] and say
[1:54:29] nice then I'm going to dress like this
[1:54:31] one
[1:54:32] but not with God
[1:54:36] we don't look at another object
[1:54:40] he looks at himself
[1:54:44] even brother Brennham says
[1:54:47] God don't look at you.
[1:54:51] He even says God look don't look at me
[1:54:55] bren
[1:54:57] I quote
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; he says he looks at Christ
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; because Christ
[1:55:07] the mystery of God that is Christ.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; So the only way I can appease God that's
[1:55:16] when I look like him.
[1:55:20] Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; you know at beauty contest,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; beauty contest,
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; you need a blind man.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; They stand there with glasses, adjusting
[1:55:36] the glasses. I I
[1:55:40] figure
[1:55:42] when passing there you know
[1:55:52] we find that he is burning
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; because they are half naked
[1:55:56] don't burn.
[1:55:58] So a judge bing also

[1:56:16] he bent that way when he was busy.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, brothers and sisters,
[1:56:24] these things are true.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:57:10] All right, let us leave the what? What

[1:57:26] Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But he will remain.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; You know, if I can say to you,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; look at this glass.
[1:57:41] I said,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; and I said, look at it.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; You keep looking
[1:57:50] as the minutes go,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; you get tired.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; You can't look at this last forever.
[1:57:56] Amen.
[1:57:59] Oh, the pastor is making me watch. But
[1:58:01] if I can say look at Jesus.
[1:58:04] Amen. Amen. The more you are looking at
[1:58:08] him,
[1:58:09] the more you look at him
[1:58:12] is the more you have the desire to look
[1:58:14] at him.
[1:58:17] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:20] Amen. Amen. But if I can say look at
[1:58:25] that beauty.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; You follow. Look at him.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Now you've got to have a lust to look.
[1:58:37] Not laugh. Lust.
[1:58:41] Then you follow her. You follow him.
[1:58:44] Follow her. Next time
[1:58:50] where is that person?
[1:58:52] hospital last week.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Oh no, she went to the hospital last
[1:58:55] week.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; She's sick.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; That's man. That's the beauty of the
[1:58:59] water.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Did you hear?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; But if they say look at Jesus,
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:59:09] yesterday, today and forever.
[1:59:14] Amen. You still be wanting to look at
[1:59:16] him.
[1:59:19] Peter looked at him once.
[1:59:22] and said the words of eternal life
[1:59:26] are with you since that day
[1:59:30] follow Jesus
[1:59:32] even today.
[1:59:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:39] The Samaritan woman came there were
[1:59:42] fishes and all hairs and what but when
[1:59:45] she saw Jesus
[1:59:48] not Instagram when she saw Jesus
[1:59:53] Amen. Amen. She took off the tattered
[1:59:58] garments
[2:00:01] and said I perceive
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; you are the Messiah.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; And from that day
[2:00:09] She followed Jesus
[2:00:12] and the prophet comes and say it is
[2:00:15] because she was predestinated.
[2:00:20] A person that is predestinated,
[2:00:23] he has seen him
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; or she has seen him
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; and when he shall appear,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; she will see him.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the name of Jesus be praised.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Let's pass here.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; How shall he
[2:00:49] when we shall be with him and the
[2:00:52] saints? You can imagine New Jerusalem
[2:00:58] for all this time.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He went there to prepare it.
[2:01:06] God won't
[2:01:10] surprise us
[2:01:15] as brother Brenham spoke
[2:01:18] that he's been there
[2:01:21] preparing that city.
[2:01:26] Amen. What a city.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine how it looks like?
[2:01:34] Then he comes and say
[2:01:37] when maybe you are thinking of flying
[2:01:39] saucer or sa
[2:01:42] he says when you are there
[2:01:46] you'll travel like in a thought
[2:01:51] meaning that you'd be where you want to
[2:01:55] be.
[2:01:58] Amen. But before we lose
[2:02:07] it, we still going
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; until we wind up back again and show
[2:02:11] that this battle of Armageddon
[2:02:16] and
[2:02:17] we are going to turn like this.
[2:02:21] This battle of Armageddon
[2:02:23] is not the battle against Israel.
[2:02:27] is the battle against the coming of the
[2:02:29] Lord.
[2:02:33] That's why the rapture
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; is for the people
[2:02:38] that are really
[2:02:41] God has
[2:02:44] uh let me say empty them or
[2:02:53] with all the
[2:02:55] powers of heaven.
[2:02:58] He is the most powerful.
[2:03:02] He has the whole world in on a tip of
[2:03:05] his finger like this.
[2:03:11] Satan, you are playing.
[2:03:13] As I said, what if God
[2:03:18] while we are breaking and saying things,
[2:03:21] God can stop the right in the middle of
[2:03:23] the day.
[2:03:29] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:33] one still trying to do this
[2:03:36] and then he just switches off the sun.
[2:03:40] I sometimes think of such things.
[2:03:45] I'm sure. But I I do think of such
[2:03:48] things.
[2:03:50] I fear him so much.
[2:03:53] Amen. He can stop the sun
[2:03:57] right in the middle of the day
[2:04:04] off switch
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; and then he just switches it off.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's when you will see that.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; If God can just switch off,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; where will you be?
[2:04:22] You hear one screaming mom.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Even old man.
[2:04:36] Where's my mama? Where's my
[2:04:40] things of the world shall end. Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; You can kill my body.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:51] that my spirit
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; my soul
[2:04:56] is in Christ.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; You should always put that thing
[2:05:02] together.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; When I was threatened through the
[2:05:08] YouTube,
[2:05:12] somebody saying there will be this and
[2:05:15] this against him.
[2:05:18] This date. I I prayed for that person
[2:05:23] because he was telling lies
[2:05:26] through the YouTube
[2:05:29] lies man
[2:05:33] the lies he is telling
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; even Satan
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; should you say to Satan
[2:05:44] referring to the this YouTube lies
[2:05:47] he will
[2:05:49] with tears running down his cheek.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; I know I'm a father of lies, but this
[2:05:56] one
[2:06:04] lies out of the blue.
[2:06:07] Hallelujah.
