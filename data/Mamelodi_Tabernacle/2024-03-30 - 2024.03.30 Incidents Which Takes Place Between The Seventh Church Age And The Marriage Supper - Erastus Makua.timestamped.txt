[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:11:59] S you must not
[1:12:02] forget that that thing
[1:12:05] happened at the beginning of the Gentile
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:12] dispensation it was at the
[1:12:15] beginning of the Gentile
[1:12:19] dispensation and we are
[1:12:21] told by the prophet that at the end of
[1:12:26] the gentle
[1:12:29] dispensation this thing must happen
[1:12:32] again because the idol
[1:12:37] there it was the image of a holy
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:46] man it was the image of a holy
[1:12:49] man and the holy man
[1:12:54] wasel
[1:12:57] NE believed that his
[1:13:02] God has gone into this
[1:13:06] man this man here is not a is not just
[1:13:11] only a
[1:13:12] man is my God in this
[1:13:18] man he named
[1:13:24] Daniel
[1:13:26] Bela is the name was the name of
[1:13:29] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:33] Scot when he said let's make an
[1:13:39] image he was making an image of
[1:13:47] Daniel according to him you see when we
[1:13:51] come
[1:13:53] to idolatry
[1:13:57] people who made some
[1:14:01] images they think that looks like
[1:14:09] that Nez when he made the
[1:14:13] image he looked
[1:14:15] at he said my looks like this
[1:14:19] man so we must make when we make the
[1:14:23] image we must make the image of this
[1:14:27] man hallelujah
[1:14:31] hallelujah look how he saw the
[1:14:35] image now remember the
[1:14:38] image now this is a home place
[1:14:44] now that is what the prophet says he
[1:14:47] says this is a home place
[1:14:50] now and I'm also the same this is a home
[1:14:54] place
[1:14:56] I believe that the image the King
[1:14:59] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:03] made was of
[1:15:05] Daniel a holy
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:09] man when was making image he was making
[1:15:13] an image of Daniel a holy
[1:15:20] man but now remember
[1:15:23] I John was making a
[1:15:28] prophecy he says there will come a
[1:15:33] beast that Beast will come out of the
[1:15:35] out of the
[1:15:37] land the first Beast came out of the
[1:15:41] water but the Beast which came out of
[1:15:44] the
[1:15:46] land John says it it said to

[1:18:26] here and in this book Seven Church
[1:18:31] ages I I I also will keep thee from the
[1:18:35] hour of
[1:18:37] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:18:43] world which will come upon all the
[1:18:47] world so try them that dwell upon the
[1:18:52] Earth this verse
[1:18:55] is not a declaration that the true
[1:18:58] church will go into and through
[1:19:04] tribulation if it meant
[1:19:07] that it would have said
[1:19:10] it but it said I will keep thee from the
[1:19:15] hour of
[1:19:18] Temptation this temptation exist like
[1:19:20] the Temptation in
[1:19:23] Eden
[1:19:26] it will be a very inviting
[1:19:31] proposition it will be a very inviting
[1:19:36] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:19:40] to God's commanded
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:46] way when you are listening to this
[1:19:51] proposition it will be so
[1:19:53] enticing
[1:19:56] but it will be
[1:20:00] again it
[1:20:03] says yet from the standpoint of human
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:11] reasoning it will be so very
[1:20:17] right so
[1:20:21] enlightening and
[1:20:23] lifegiving
[1:20:25] to fool the
[1:20:28] we only the very
[1:20:31] elect will not be
[1:20:34] foed the Temptation will come as
[1:20:38] follow the ecal
[1:20:44] move that has
[1:20:46] studed on what it seems such a beautiful
[1:20:50] blessed
[1:20:53] principle
[1:20:55] fulfilling Christ
[1:20:59] prayer that we all might be
[1:21:03] one when they are proposing to to come
[1:21:07] with this
[1:21:09] thing they Jesus
[1:21:12] said we must all be
[1:21:16] one so that so we must make a union
[1:21:21] like of the
[1:21:23] churches to fulfill the
[1:21:26] scripture so that we can be all we can
[1:21:29] all be
[1:21:32] one then she
[1:21:37] says when this
[1:21:41] principle become so strong
[1:21:45] politically that she be pressure upon
[1:21:48] the
[1:21:51] government to cause all to join with her
[1:21:58] either
[1:22:00] directly or through
[1:22:04] adherence to the principle inacted into
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] law so that no people will be
[1:22:16] recognized as an actual
[1:22:20] Church unless under direct or indirect
[1:22:32] they did the
[1:22:33] same they did the same during Jesus
[1:22:40] time the
[1:22:42] churches turned him down
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:46] first then when theyve turned him
[1:22:48] down then they go to the
[1:22:51] government so that the government can
[1:22:54] help
[1:22:55] them because they don't have power to
[1:22:58] declare him dead or to to kill
[1:23:03] him the power to kill only comes from
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:08] government but after the churches have
[1:23:10] turned
[1:23:12] down these
[1:23:14] churches they have turned the word
[1:23:17] down they have
[1:23:19] already they already the word
[1:23:22] down but what is what is remaining
[1:23:26] now they they will ask the
[1:23:30] government to formulate a
[1:23:34] law so that the government can formulate
[1:23:37] a
[1:23:40] law that will force
[1:23:43] all all
[1:23:45] churches belong to this
[1:23:50] Union and if they don't belong to that
[1:23:53] Union
[1:23:55] then you will never be allowed to have a
[1:23:58] church like
[1:24:01] this never have never allow to
[1:24:05] preach you never allow to give Comfort
[1:24:08] to the people who need
[1:24:11] comfort they are still they still they
[1:24:14] are still going to ask the
[1:24:17] government and they on the way
[1:24:23] now was there was something a certain
[1:24:26] woman was leading a certain campaign you
[1:24:29] know that
[1:24:33] woman calling people to
[1:24:36] register how if you are a pastor you
[1:24:39] must tell them how you become a
[1:24:46] pastor about
