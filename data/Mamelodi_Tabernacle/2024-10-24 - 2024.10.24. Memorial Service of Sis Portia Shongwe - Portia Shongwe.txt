Description:
Memorial Service of Sis Portia Shongwe
Title: Concern Is on The Resurrection
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana on 24 October 2024 at Daveyton Etwatwa

Matthews 22: 29 -32 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience we as Christians we are not concern about death but more about resurrection.

We are not much concern about death, but we are concern about resurrection. Death does not have a place in our heart.

Our ministry should reflect that of our Lord Jesus Christ. Which was concerned with resurrection.

Jesus' ministry was changing with dispensations. At other dispensation he asked his disciples who do men say that I the son of man am? At other time He spoke about his crucifixion that the son of man will be taken and be crucified. But because he always ends with victory, he said but on the third day He will rise again.

Jesus was always displaying resurrection. When He went to Lazarus, He displayed resurrection and when He went to Tabitha, He also displayed resurrection.

When His ministry touches death it must also touch resurrection. He always Has an answer to it.

In the heart of man is the relaxation place of God. In the soul of man there is no death. 

Jesus' ministry is not finished if the people do not know who He is. Jesus said to Peter to tell no man that He was the Christ, because it was not revealed by flesh and blood. So, every man had to receive it by revelation.

God is not worried much about your flesh, but he is worried about His word that is in your flesh. There is a life that comes from God that we need to respect above this life.

A quickening spirit is the one that will change our bodies. If in your soul there is the word of God, it will germinate and form the word. As overcomers we have overcome the world and the system of the world. As overcomers death will never touch us. Our God is not God of the dead but of the living.

hope we are grown up we understand exactly what has transpired that is why we are having our service here just to have some few words of encouragement to the to the family and relatives the friends and the neighbors too may the Lord bless them can we read from the book of Matthew 22 let's read from let's just one ver 29 Matthew 32 or vers 29 and 30th 22 verse verse 2 29 and 30 Jesus answered and said unto them ye do not not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven okay let's bow our head Heavenly Father this evening again Lord for some few minutes we are gathered here Lord to be with the family just to read the word Lord and we invite you Lord to come and be part of our gathering here Lord so that we should engage each other and be one mind and one spirit we just read one verse wish we believe Lord Lord Almighty you'll expand it that it will reach the hearts of those that are saddened and then by the end of the service they will feel that gracious Lord Almighty you are the father of all God father of all those who felt the pain and all those that are SED you be the one Lord Almighty that will always uh bring your presence Lord Almighty they might feel it may you bless this scripture that we have read may you Lord Almighty let it feel let it find a place Lord in our hearts father we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated God BL what time is it my brother if there's anybody that has got time can you just borrow me the was sheets it's during the week we we don't have to take much time people are going to work tomorrow I just just want to I won't be long maybe I'll just take something like 30 minutes there's two watches there they make sure it's I think it's 10 to9 10 to9 maybe I might end up at 209 just may the Lord bless you so we've just read one scripture says now uh God uh I would like us to drag it up to verse 32 start from verse 29 up to verse 32 verse 29 Jesus answered and said unto them ye do not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the Dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God saying I am the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob God is not the god of the dead but of the living amen okay fine amen uh I think we are not so much concerned about the death we are concerned about the resurrection amen so now our ministry should uh reflect that one of our Lord Jesus Christ so death is not much in our hearts it hasn't got space in our heart we are concerned our concern is on the resurrection not the death now the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ was much on the resurrection and all his speech his sermons it it they will always end up with with with with conquering so I remember whenever he changes from one dispensation to another his always speaking about him going uh to be killed but stop there he say now okay I will the Pharisees the elders they will come and arrest me and they will beit me up they do whatever they want they will kill me but I will resurrect on the there's a time where he said now destroy this Temple I will raise it up in three days exactly so now his speech is always full of resurrection and he he always displayed Resurrection whenever there's death if he happen to go where the death is he will display Resurrection you remember about Abra I mean Lazarus they told him that Lazarus is dead but when when he arrived there he displayed resurrection that that was part of his ministry remember about he also displayed and now when he speaks about himself he spoke about his resurrection Hallelujah now here in verse 31 verse 31 2 he says uh I am the god of Abraham and know he start by saying but as touching the Resurrection on verse 31 but as touching the resurrection of the Dead have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God himself saying I am the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob then he continues and says God is not the god of the day right he is not the good of the I mean not the of the day but of the living because his ministry if he touches death he must touch Resurrection he won't just say death and then it end UPS there he must always have an answer we together so now that's why I said that has got no space in our heart am I understand now according to the Bible when God created man he created a space in a man which was his place it's like when you are building a house you cannot build a house and and you don't identify your position in that house build that house it might have a kitchen might have a dining room but you will say when I want to relax this is my place so when you build it you know where is your relaxation when God created man if he wanted to relax he knew very well that he will relax his his soul in heart of a man so now in a heart of a man is the relaxation place of God that's where the soul is now in the soul of man there's no death now I've got a scripture here okay let let me let me first show you the dispensation on Matthew 16 you saw a Ministry that does not change according to the dispensation then he that Ministry becomes dominant does not move so the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ it was moving the ministry of Moses taking the children of Israel it was on Transit it was changing whenever it is when he crosses the Red Sea the ministry changes when he crosses the river Jordan the ministry changes our ministry the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ was exactly like that there was a time when he displays the power when he raises the days when he he he he he he woke upon the sea he was displaying the power right but there came a time but but that Ministry he wanted people to know who he was Ministry would not been a finished Ministry without people knowing who he was especially the one that he was he has selected he pointed them one by one follow me follow me follow me like he has pointed us call us by his way follow me follow me follow me the reason is that now he wanted us to know him to know who he is unless if we don't know who he is that Ministry is not finished there was a time when they said to him tell us exactly who are you are you the Messiah or not he said to them I have displayed my life the things that I was doing tells you who am I right then he went on to his disciples but these people when they see me who do they say I am see they said no we are Jeremiah you know what they said then he knew that now my Ministry is not finished then he said what about you because you sleep with me you eat me you do everything what about you who do you say that I the son of man Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God he gave him the keys it's that's SW my Ministry is I want them to know who am I so he said now there are the keys and then thereafter he changes the ministry that's what I want to I want to read now now in verse uh chapter 16 chapter 16 verse 21 verse 21 remember when we were before we repented we were very much afraid of death and our parents uh displayed the fear of death I am I could still hear the squeaking of the voice of my aunt when there's death so it was something that was traumatizing me when I I know in the olden days you know that if maybe there is a a funeral passing by C you have to kneel down and put your head yeah on the head scared now what the Bible says says Jesus Christ you will read that one you will read it in in in in Hebrews chapter to start from verse 14 amen Hebrews 2:4 he says he became a man he took the form of he didn't take the form of an Angel no he became a human being and shed his blood to relieve those that were afraid of death those that were Bound by death now how did Death bound us we thought that that was the end of everything when somebody passed on we say that is not what God says okay let me come back to this now in verse 21 ver 21 okay firstly after that is after Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God then the Bible says verse 20 ver then charge he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ now I said to you his ministry was not finished if they don't know who he was now after knowing actually it's not knowing after the revelation after it was revealed unto them then he said now tell no man now why does it say tell no man after the revelation it's because he said to Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal that unto you so now if flesh and blood has not revealed that and then the other people also it should not be Flesh and Blood even if you can say this is the Messiah but if it's not revealed unto them they will still be doubtful let let them have a revelation now what is now once you have the Revelation then all fears vanish are we together because you could see beyond now if you see this side of life then you'll have fear look God I would say it doesn't worry so much about your flesh no he's worried about his word that is in that flesh when he send you like he sent John the Baptist when his ministry was finished God was finished with body they cut off his head a strong man how we together an anointed man but did they cut off his head right amen and we give it to a dam cell they display they display the most powerful Prophet point a messiah who who would say uh to Kings and princess and stand and proclaim the power of God but when the ministry is finished God takes his word so the power in you is the word of God that is in you are we together that is why Jesus said was the end of the ministry the angel was there to console him your Prophet when he died he was shuted the most powerful Prophet who could stand in the Gap and restore everything are we together amen m i mean Adam caused a crack in the will of Eternity there was a crack the only man that stood in that Gap and P up that is the prophet but but look how he died when his ministry is finished shut at there to show that there's nothing in this there's another life that you need to respect there is a life that comes from God now I wanted to read you this scripture I I read here he charged the angels I mean he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ right amen but he came so that people should know that he was Jesus the Christ and when the the disciples says yes you are Jesus Christ tell no man now that was the end of his ministry but then read verse 21 says from that time [Music] fourth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and and be killed you see it doesn't end there end be killed but then he continues now and be raised again the third day you see now he changes the ministry now that he's going to be killed but he's going to resurrect the the third day now uh in the olden days uh we had lot of churches also but the notorious ones of the Pharisees the the and the scribes now they will always challenge him about what he is they were Leed they knew the scriptures some of them were were professors they they will challenge him about his personality about his ministry yeah now the the the there was the s s how do you pronounce it s SES they did not believe in the resurrection they could defend that you remember they said to him you know that the law of Moses says that if a man get married and die his brother must the wife must take over the wife then he said yes it's like that said now there was a woman who lost a husband then the younger brother married her on and on and on and he also died the third one died to the seven now in heaven whose wife is that is why he said you don't know the scriptures because in heaven there's no marriage we we we are angels see now the Bible says oh oh in the Book of John our Lord Jesus Christ said I think it's in verse 63 John 6 62 or 63 yeah go John 663 yeah so now our ministry like that of our Lord Jesus Christ has got nothing to do with death because we have passed we are on that other side of that each and every one of us it can happen that you should go there are those that will be around until Rapture came until comes a time when our body is changed but uh the ministry in the Bible is based on the resurrection but now even if you die and death you know that is the separation as long as you have separated from this flesh and then there will be a time when it comes to Resurrection that you you will go back to your body and then when you go back to your body it's only then that there's a change are we together now what will make the change what will make the change let's read it verse 6 now let's read verse 63 it's already oh I've got five minutes 5 minutes it is the spirit that Quicken it right remember that now now the second Adam the Bible says the first Adam was a living soul and the second Adam was a quickening spirit now quickening Spirit now is the one that will change your body it is the spirit that Quicken [Music] it the flesh profited nothing are we aware that our flesh profited nothing right right but it continues says uh the the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you you see what is important the words that I speak unto you now the words that are written in this Bible and he says and they are alive they are spirit and they are alive the words that he spoke did not end up him speaking those words are the very same one that are in this Bible those words are the very same one that we are reading he says they are spirits and and they are life so what is life life is the word if if you go to to the Book of John chapter 8 verse 37 have you ever read that one John chapter 8 now verse 37 then he says I know that you Abraham seed but he seek to kill me because my word had no place in you the resurrection has got to do with those words that they should find a place in you and when those words find a place in you the Bible says the the word of God is the seed right now if the word of God is the seed definitely that seat must germinate and that seat must germinate that word is the word of God now if it germinates it should form God because it's the word of God so the word give birth to the word now the word cannot die I are we together the word cannot die if in your heart which is in your soul then there's a word of God that word will germinate and form the weight this body is just a field where the seed is planted because he says there was a s that went on to S A SE some seed fell into the road then it was eaten by birs the other field seed on the stones which there was no moisture there the other seed uh at the wrong place where they were squashed germinated but they were squashed but now the good I mean the the right seed is the one that fell on the good ground and the good ground is our hearts are we together and our hearts goes hand in hand with predestination God cannot create you just for fun there is a reason why you are here and there is a reason why he's going to destroy this world and now the reason for you to be here is for him to plant his seat to and when he has planted his seat to you actually you are here to display him because he says he that overcome he displays his seat in you so that you could overcome the evil spirit are we together then he gives a promise that if you overcome I will give you this now to you who are in this time that you are living in he says if you overcome I will come and sit with you in my father's Throne as I as I have also over and I'm sitting at my father's are we together now now as Overcomers we have overcome the world we have overcome the system of the world now as overcome us death can never touch us our God is not the god of death no our God is God of life and the Bible says he that find me has find life now that we have found him we are alive and we will never never die are we together the flesh will die but we will never die because we are not that flesh we we dwell in that flesh may may the Lord help me to keep my [Applause] promise God bless
