[57:54] ground over there

[58:00] crowd
[58:02] but that's the only place we have
[58:07] please don't park around the
[58:09] neighborhood
[58:13] it's a very serious complaint
[58:17] and
[58:18] it is very difficult for us
[58:22] when the neighbors come
[58:24] shouting at us
[58:27] angry at us as if we want to announce
[58:30] this
[58:33] we had an incident this morning that the
[58:36] young man was sweating at one of our
[58:38] brothers
[58:40] because somebody parked
[58:42] at the neighbor's place

[58:49] in the right names
[58:51] one day the lord god
[58:54] will honor us and give us power
[59:00] and remember

[1:32:14] the sinner
[1:32:16] is influenced by the holy spirit

[1:32:27] and the wrong gives influence and the
[1:32:30] right to give
[1:32:38] influence from
[1:32:41] um
[1:32:43] with blackness and separation are
[1:32:47] dominated from

[1:34:02] leave
[1:34:03] it like this until we come to it
[1:34:09] amen the trinity of heaven
[1:34:13] and trinity years old
[1:34:16] jesus even said
[1:34:18] jesus
[1:34:21] the
[1:34:22] unbelievers
[1:34:25] confronted him
[1:35:11] the reason we cannot agree
[1:35:15] to say
[1:35:17] you are from
[1:35:19] nibuya
[1:35:20] i am from about me
[1:35:24] can you read it brother
[1:35:34] and he said unto them
[1:35:36] we are from beneath uh just that way
[1:35:40] where he started
[1:35:46] 19
[1:35:48] then said they unto him where is thy
[1:35:51] father
[1:35:52] jesus answered
[1:35:54] he never know me nor my father
[1:35:57] if he had known me he should have known
[1:35:59] my father also
[1:36:01] this word spake jesus in the treasure
[1:36:05] as he taught in the temple
[1:36:07] and no man laid hands on him for his
[1:36:10] hour was not yet come
[1:36:12] then said jesus again unto them i go my
[1:36:15] way and he shall seek me and shall die
[1:36:18] in your sins
[1:36:20] whether i go he cannot come
[1:36:22] then said the jews will he kill himself
[1:36:26] because he saith whether i go it cannot
[1:36:28] come
[1:36:29] and he said unto them
[1:36:31] ye are from beneath i am from above
[1:36:34] ye are of this world i am not of this
[1:36:37] world
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:40] that that's it
[1:36:42] now let's take it from here i see
[1:36:45] chatter from the battle of armageddon he
[1:36:48] better offer market
[1:36:50] and it is
[1:36:53] misunderstood by
[1:36:55] the people
[1:36:56] he did the abandoning the reason
[1:37:00] why they don't understand
[1:37:04] this is hard to follow because
[1:37:07] it will happen after the tribulation
[1:37:11] period
[1:37:12] after
[1:37:14] the tribulation amen
[1:37:17] now
[1:37:17] we we just want to
[1:37:21] look at the
[1:37:23] the way
[1:37:25] it is unfolding
[1:37:30] you know if you were to tell somebody
[1:37:34] about something
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:42] a woman
[1:37:48] if

[1:38:15] at that time
[1:38:19] will he be able to understand what's in
[1:38:22] this season
[1:38:24] you will be
[1:38:26] the only person will understand is the
[1:38:28] one who will be around at that
[1:38:31] particular time
[1:38:35] now is the person who knows that after
[1:38:38] the tribulation period then
[1:38:42] this and this will
[1:39:07] god has told you about the battle of
[1:39:10] armageddon
