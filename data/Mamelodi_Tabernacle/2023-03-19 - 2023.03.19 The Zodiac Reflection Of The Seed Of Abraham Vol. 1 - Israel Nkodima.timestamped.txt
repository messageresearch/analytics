[19:49] and the Lord said unto Abram after that
[19:52] Lord was separated from him lift up now
[19:56] thine eyes and look from the place where
[19:59] thou at northward and Southward in

[20:13] the earth so that if a man can number
[20:16] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[20:19] seed also be numbered arise walk through
[20:22] the land in the length of it and in the
[20:26] breath of it for I will give it unto
[20:28] them
[20:29] then Abram removed from his tent and
[20:32] came and dwelled in the plane of mammary

[21:07] and Abram said behold to me thou has
[21:10] given no seed and lo one born in my
[21:14] house is mine hey
[21:16] and behold the word of the Lord came
[21:18] unto him saying this shall not be thy
[21:21] name but he that shall come forth out of
[21:25] thine own bowels shall be thy hair
[21:28] and he brought it forth abroad and said
[21:32] look now to what heaven and tell the
[21:35] Stars if thou be able to number them and
[21:38] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[21:41] counted each to him for righteousness

[22:02] okay looky let's bow our heads
[22:09] almighty God we come today again this

[22:37] at the city
[22:40] and as the prophet says the bride is
[22:42] just like that City amen that's right
[22:46] that's why they set up here on Earth
[22:49] coming up their seven steps to the
[22:53] king's chamber
[22:55] type in the uh is very typical because
[22:59] the bride is like a city so we thank you
[23:03] this morning
[23:04] for healing their sick
[23:07] as it was mentioned that many were
[23:11] played for and they got healed because

[24:41] the book The Invisible Union of the
[24:44] Bride Fitness
[24:48] the invisible Union of the Bride
[24:52] what prompted me to do that was one
[24:55] thing

[25:01] when I speak foreign
[25:18] now I've been telling my brother timing
[25:20] again
[25:27] my thoughts
[25:33] it's a title yeah
[25:37] but the people marabad they just can't
[25:41] grasp it is
[25:53] so now that that's the thing now I I
[25:57] checked with the uh invisible Union
[26:04] that maybe my our weights are now
[26:10] invisible to their people foreign
[26:25] the only thing is we are going to talk
[26:27] about
[26:28] uh
[26:30] the Seed of Abraham
[26:37] before maybe we try to preach let me

[28:21] Stars
[28:22] he reflected he
[28:25] himself back to his tasks
[28:32] amen amen
[28:36] we were trying to talk about the
[28:41] who was this
[28:43] who's this man who came for at the birth
[28:46] of Jesus Christ
[28:59] he reflected himself back to the Stars
[29:06] this is what we are coming to where we
[29:09] are going to talk about
[29:13] amen I mean now the Seed of Abraham
[29:17] Abraham
[29:19] in zodiac
[29:23] now I read I read here coming from
[29:27] zodiac
[29:31] zodiac speaks of the 12 signs
[29:37] but wait until we bring it first
[29:42] which is 12 is always Jewish
[29:50] amen amen
[29:52] and then the prophet speaks of a tree
[29:58] and he says
[30:00] the roots are
[30:06] is Jewish
[30:10] is Jewish
[30:13] that's why you say even right now
[30:16] he says the church has
[30:21] kicked him out of the kicked him out
[30:26] foreign
[30:35] and
[30:39] you remember the meeting on Mount
[30:41] Transfiguration
[30:44] it was a great meeting
[30:48] amen amen they're talking about their
[30:52] duties
[30:57] then we say see them appearing during
[31:00] the tribulation period
[31:05] and then when it was a tribulation
[31:08] periodication it was
[31:11] but he was there
[31:13] being introduced activation and we'll
[31:17] come to that
[31:19] from Mount Transfiguration
[31:23] I mean like our said pool is from
[31:26] foreign
[31:40] okay I mean now brother Branham says God
[31:47] created
[31:49] three words
[31:54] you know about those words
[31:57] all right I mean
[32:03] we have read some time back I mean the
[32:07] old timers would know
[32:08] [Music]
[32:09] um
[32:14] foreign
[32:39] [Music]
[32:52] foreign
[33:17] it came from
[33:19] foreign
[33:53] okay give me where he says and will be
[33:57] like the dust of the earth Genesis
[33:59] dating
[34:06] is two different things I mean he spoke
[34:09] of your seeds
[34:12] being like the dance the dust of the
[34:15] Earth
[34:16] and again
[34:18] like the stars of Heaven
[34:25] and the stars and the Stars
[34:30] because the dust speaks of the creation
[34:37] actually creation is not the dust
[34:40] but the creation was put
[34:43] into God
[34:49] but again he says
[34:52] shall be like the stars it was
[34:59] so if you can tell
[35:03] if you can look at the stars
[35:06] you'll see it shall be like those stars
[35:11] but we are coming to that because that
[35:15] it speaks of the zodiac sign
[35:20] your seed
[35:27] all right
[35:29] now here let's read this one and close
[35:34] for the coming foreign
[35:56] [Music]
[36:01] who can be reminded not even reminded
[36:04] but who remember
[36:10] I'm still talking though I'm not
[36:13] preaching I'm just joking
[36:15] amen amen and so
[36:45] William at home
[36:47] do you know that yeah we'll we'll go to
[36:50] the Book of Job see these things
[36:56] the oldest book in the
[36:59] in the Bible
[37:03] the oldest book in the Bible is
[37:11] the prophet tells you he had no bible to
[37:14] read I am a prophet
[37:17] but he could look at the signs
[37:29] that's why the measures
[37:32] the birth of Christ from the first Bible
[37:43] foreign
[37:48] okay
[38:25] foreign
[38:58] [Music]
[39:06] they they got in line
[39:10] with that sign back up analysis it's not
[39:14] just to say hey
[39:17] that's another thing no other person
[39:20] could see now
[39:27] the visibility of the stars
[39:39] but he says
[39:47] there was something else
[39:55] and they started
[39:58] to follow but tomorrow now you watch
[40:02] if that star goes out of the way
[40:07] they ask them people
[40:09] where is he okay
[40:14] now because the people are not part of
[40:16] the Stars
[40:20] they could only read the scriptures
[40:31] just like everybody's preaching them
[40:38] something different
[40:41] you can ask questions about the message
[40:57] exactly what is
[41:01] a different thing from just saying it is
[41:14] the the the
[41:17] constellation would leave them
[41:20] they start to ask their people
[41:26] you know it is just the same thing
[41:30] if you lose
[41:33] the site keep on of the
[41:37] constellations
[41:43] foreign
[41:45] [Music]
[42:11] I mean
[42:12] amen and
[42:14] [Music]
[42:16] like
[42:19] I don't think you
[42:21] even if
[42:24] you can sleep a very deep sleep
[42:30] one day
[42:32] will beat us be goodbye okay
[42:44] maybe God wants me to go Fellowship
[42:46] someone do you have a dream
[42:54] once
[42:56] just like like that boy
[42:59] one said
[43:01] I think I've seen this boy close to a
[43:05] star a cross
[43:18] [Applause]
[43:19] [Music]
[43:27] all right
[43:30] you know I mean that's the same thing
[43:32] with us
[43:34] just show us the way challenge show us
[43:38] the seventh seeds
[43:43] because he started Beyond Time
[43:47] and as we were there with him
[43:51] there was any time
[43:54] show us
[43:59] that the people believe that it was not
[44:03] revealed
[44:07] foreign
[44:47] that's why with the Seven Seas
[44:50] it was big day with them
[44:53] but when it went and the sun in the
[44:58] family dropped the book him
[45:02] and the Lamb of God
[45:05] came and yeah
[45:09] to restore to us
[45:12] and he became the wealthy one yeah
[45:15] because
[45:18] the with one was supposed to
[45:23] um
[45:25] shed his
[45:27] blacks
[45:31] and with family matters
[45:37] so that's why uh
[45:42] by usberg with something else
[45:49] it should be blood
[45:52] and he his own blood and Maria why
[45:56] because it should be the blood of the
[45:58] Kings
[46:02] because once we are saved by the blood
[46:05] of the Kings
[46:08] then we would Trace ourselves back
[46:15] wherever you come from
[46:17] it should be the show me the blood
[46:22] show me the cross then I'll find my way
[46:25] back again okay
[46:31] now I I'm I'm reading this
[46:35] God wrote three Bibles
[46:39] one of them
[46:44] I will tell you what is zodiac dollars
[46:48] in the sky
[46:50] that's the first Bible I'm at home and
[46:54] as I say
[46:57] used to this Bible
[47:01] the Bible in the book forms
[47:12] and all those that we are coming to them
[47:16] amen amen the Pleiades he played this
[47:20] the most beautiful place
[47:24] in zodiac but when
[47:28] God spoke to Abraham
[47:32] he said
[47:34] look up
[47:40] your children
[47:41] will be like what you see but not
[47:45] foreign
[47:48] amen amen
[47:51] his church
[47:53] was just like what he has seen even
[47:59] this morning is
[48:02] just like what he sees he knows
[48:06] and what he has seen
[48:09] that is
[48:14] something that he hasn't met before
[48:20] not even meant but we were in him
[48:24] before the foundation of the world
[48:28] that's why the Bible says
[48:31] [Music]
[48:34] foreign
[49:35] their only language
[49:37] is the mysteries of God
[49:42] that's right this is what they know
[49:44] Satan can never touch them
