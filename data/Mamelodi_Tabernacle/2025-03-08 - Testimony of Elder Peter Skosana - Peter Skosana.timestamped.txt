[1:28] this fashion
[1:32] uh I I was around 29 years of age by
[1:37] then 29 I am now
[1:41] 77
[1:47] years by then I was not a
[1:52] Believer I was here in
[1:56] M was
[1:58] working that was in
[2:00] [Music]
[2:02] 1977
[2:05] 1977 so it happened that uh you know I
[2:09] was just I didn't I didn't believe in
[2:13] God I didn't have a
[2:17] Bible I didn't care whether God was
[2:19] there or
[2:21] not or hell was there or
[2:25] not mine was just luxur
[2:32] uh yes I was a
[2:35] sinner drinking
[2:39] smoking and then one
[2:41] day I got
[2:43] sick from
[2:47] work and
[2:49] then in those days we were using
[2:54] trains I was working at Queen Queenswood
[3:00] so I all lighted here at
[3:03] watl I went to see a
[3:07] doctor that doctor was my friend
[3:12] also so he said to
[3:15] me I need to give you two shorts of
[3:22] penicilin uh I don't want to take the
[3:25] pastor's
[3:27] time pen is an
[3:32] [Music]
[3:33] antibiotic which was allergic to my
[3:38] blood so yes he gave me those
[3:42] penisin two of
[3:44] them I think it was around 5 or
[3:50] 5 I was from
[3:53] work was to work for
[3:57] Simons righten
[4:00] so after those
[4:02] shorts then I saw
[4:06] Blackness and then I saw
[4:11] darkness and
[4:13] then I could see that now I am
[4:18] dying even if I Can't Describe
[4:23] [Music]
[4:24] death but that was death
[4:30] so I
[4:32] struggled I didn't even know that I have
[4:34] a soul or or a spirit during those
[4:40] days and then said now if this is
[4:46] death then let it
[4:49] come great people
[4:53] died Kings
[4:57] died so if he dead let it
[5:00] [Music]
[5:02] come but uh I didn't know what will come
[5:06] after that
[5:10] dat well it did
[5:12] [Music]
[5:14] come my soul went out of my
[5:19] body I could see my body lying
[5:24] there and the doctor and the nurse
[5:29] were were busy with my
[5:33] body I was in another
[5:36] body then I went to
[5:39] them to try and tell them that here am
[5:45] I but when I want to touch the
[5:49] doctor my hand went
[5:54] through and then they were discussing
[5:56] about me
[6:00] I could hear what they were
[6:02] [Music]
[6:03] saying but they could not see
[6:07] me by then I didn't know about
[6:12] Dimensions so the doctor said okay he is
[6:17] [Music]
[6:18] dead they packed my
[6:22] body and the doctor said to the
[6:27] nest call uh the ambulance from the
[6:32] muary to come and take this
[6:35] body and phone the
[6:39] police to go and tell the the parents at
[6:42] home that he's
[6:46] dead right but could hear
[6:51] them so I was just roing
[6:55] around then all of a sudden
[7:00] something just touched
[7:03] me then the scene
[7:08] changed I was in the bottomless
[7:12] pit which is very
[7:16] dark in which you fall without hitting
[7:19] the
[7:23] ground there were so many people in
[7:27] there screaming
[7:32] nobody cares about who's next to
[7:37] him and there's a torment
[7:41] there now the torment of this
[7:47] body and the torment of the
[7:50] soul is not the
[7:54] same you see this body I can take a saw
[8:03] and so it's very
[8:07] painful but the torment of the Soul you
[8:09] cannot describe
[8:13] it the only
[8:16] description is that you go and and taste
[8:20] it you go and taste
[8:25] it that is
[8:27] why I will never leave the way
[8:31] [Applause]
[8:35] because I know what the bottomless pit
[8:43] is and I
[8:46] know what the torment
[8:52] is this
[8:54] people who are playing
[8:57] about playing around
[9:00] it's because they don't
[9:05] know
[9:07] [Music]
[9:08] okay you must make me
[9:10] [Music]
[9:12] way so I was crying falling
[9:16] [Music]
[9:18] crying
[9:21] tormented never hit the
[9:25] ground so the torment
[9:28] is you are about to wake
[9:32] up but you can't wake up we about to hit
[9:36] the
[9:37] ground but you can't hit the
[9:40] ground there's an
[9:42] unexplainable
[9:46] pain so I was saying but what have I
[9:53] done and then the voice said do you know
[9:56] where you
[9:58] are said no don't
[10:00] know and when that voice
[10:04] speaks the torment
[10:08] stops so the voice said that is the
[10:11] bottomless
[10:14] pit that is the punishment you are
[10:17] getting you're still going to be
[10:24] judged I said but I haven't done
[10:27] anything he said no you
[10:30] rejected the word of the
[10:33] [Music]
[10:35] Lord said never rejected the word of the
[10:39] Lord nobody has ever come to me about
[10:42] the
[10:43] of and the SC

[15:16] P back to the shouting and
[15:20] crying are
[15:22] [Music]

[15:37] surprised said no I certify you
[15:43] date by then I was taking out the
[15:45] cigarette and and throwing everything I
[15:49] didn't know how to

[16:37] way it was
[16:40] all so I didn't know what am I going to

[16:50] repent so that the following day I went

[16:55] work I told my coworkers

[17:03] book uh the the the St of a perfect
[17:09] man and then there's another one who

[17:23] discovered when speaks about this place
[17:25] yes the place that I was in
[17:31] then I said how do I
[17:35] repent the brother said no you can come
[17:38] to our
[17:40] church he was he was my
[17:44] [Music]
[17:45] cor what call was my
[17:53] schoolmate so he brought me to the
[17:57] service that's where
[17:59] mon knows
[18:03] me I
[18:05] came
[18:07] and the corner knows
[18:15] me is it
[18:18] okay oh can I stop here
[18:21] now to be continue
[18:26] [Music]
[18:39] okay thank you for the opportunity once
[18:44] again while we are still waiting for the
[18:50] pastor I'll just stand in this Gap
[18:55] here okay the pastor always says that
[19:00] the testimonies they
[19:05] edify amen
[19:08] amen they edify in this
[19:13] sense that maybe somebody might be
[19:18] taking the issue of uh repentance and
[19:22] worshiping God for granted
[19:29] like I I've
[19:32] said that when I was not a
[19:36] worshiper I was definitely sure that I'm
[19:40] [Music]
[19:42] right that now whoever want to worship
[19:47] God it's up to
[19:49] him and whoever doesn't want to worship
[19:52] God it's also up to
[19:55] him so it's not the same
[20:01] it isn't like that God created heaven
[20:04] and
[20:06] earth and
[20:08] everybody obliged must worship
[20:12] God and and if you don't worship
[20:17] God you definitely going to
[20:21] hell
[20:23] and in
[20:26] h there's no turning back
[20:30] your uncle won't be
[20:32] there your father won't be there your
[20:36] loved ones won't be
[20:38] there it will be
[20:42] you and the Bible
[20:45] says you will be there forever and
[20:50] ever now forever and
[20:53] ever it could be billions and billions
[20:56] of years
[20:59] okay fine last time uh
[21:01] [Music]
[21:03] I I stopped when the pastor
[21:09] arrived and even today
[21:11] please make me aware I don't want to
[21:17] take
[21:18] okay I said last
[21:21] time God sent a
[21:25] man I was still a young man
[21:30] to come and testify to
[21:34] me it was a strange
[21:36] man because during that
[21:40] time there were these fightings against
[21:43] blacks and whites here in South
[21:48] Africa you couldn't get a white
[21:52] man that will will drive all the way
[21:55] right into the center of myod
[22:00] all by
[22:02] himself so now when I was in the
[22:05] bottomless
[22:09] pet uh begging and crying and doing
[22:14] all then I was told that I was given a
[22:19] chance and the chance that I was
[22:24] given was that now I'm sorry
[22:34] oh yeah maybe it's aquilas want to what
[22:37] you call got a message I'm just saying
[22:39] to
[22:41] so I was
[22:44] given uh uh no this man I mean I said no
[22:48] because uh I didn't know these
[22:52] things and I was ignorant on that and I
[22:56] was not given a chance
[23:00] this seems to be
[23:02] unfair I was not aware that there is
[23:06] God I was not even aware that there's a
[23:09] devil actually I was not aware what type
[23:13] of life should I
[23:15] live because when you grow
[23:17] out when you grow
[23:20] out you just take anything that people
[23:22] are
[23:24] doing you follow
[23:26] friends you follow
[23:29] amilies you follow neighbors you follow
[23:33] whoever right then it was said no okay F
[23:36] but we send
[23:39] somebody and many
[23:42] times and you
[23:44] rejected so the only place for
[23:48] you is this one and when it says is this
[23:52] one and then when that voice
[23:56] speak everything stands still
[23:59] still even the torment stands
[24:03] still you could wish you could keep on
[24:08] talking but when he says now this is the
[24:10] only place for
[24:12] you then you had to go back to
[24:16] that so then you fall
[24:19] again get into the
[24:22] torment of which you cannot describe
[24:25] it now some of the things the Bible
[24:29] says they are definitely
[24:33] true when the pastor always stands
[24:36] here and says
[24:39] may to those that will miss the
[24:43] Rapture it's not a
[24:46] joke when it says the fire is
[24:50] coming it's not an ordinary fire that
[24:53] you
[24:55] seen uh when your soul is
[25:01] tormented it's not like when your body
[25:04] is
[25:04] [Music]
[25:06] tormented it's two different
[25:10] torments remember when your soul is in
[25:14] torment like that rich
[25:17] man who was in
[25:19] torment who said to
[25:22] Abraham send
[25:25] Lazarus just to get a tip
[25:30] of water just to quench my
[25:34] tongue a true
[25:37] thing okay fine it went
[25:40] on and then I kept on
[25:44] begging and then communicating with that
[25:49] voice until uh I
[25:55] I until
[25:59] I I just woke
[26:01] up find there was a white sheet covering
[26:07] me the one that they use after you
[26:10] you're dead they cover you with a
[26:13] certain uh material called k or
[26:19] something so I was once covered with
[26:22] that so it was ready to be taken to m in
[26:26] the fridge
[26:29] I I wouldn't be standing here
[26:32] today so now I was a young man I was not
[26:38] married
[26:40] then never read the Bible in my
[26:45] life and then so was offered the Bible I
[26:48] mean I told the my
[26:52] coworker who was a message believer
[26:54] Solana
[26:58] like I said he gave me the St of a
[27:01] perfect
[27:03] man I went through
[27:05] it then he gave
[27:09] me the other one what's that one can
[27:12] remind me
[27:16] demonology then I went through
[27:18] it then I saw that yes there's some
[27:22] parts which I was in that I see in this
[27:26] demonology
[27:31] then there
[27:33] thereafter he invited me to the
[27:38] service service the service was
[27:40] somewhere in a
[27:43] classroom I think in
[27:46] lady I went
[27:49] there uh there were very
[27:54] few then the pastors was pre
[28:00] in so now it was the first time in my
[28:04] life that I could hear a man speaking
[28:07] like
[28:09] that we we grew up being
[28:15] argumentative and
[28:18] myself I didn't want to speak P or or
[28:24] whatever speaking Zulu
[28:26] only I thought that the only people in
[28:29] South Africa
[28:32] Zulus because my mother was a
[28:35] Zulu so when I arrived here in
[28:37] prioria I find people speaking a funny
[28:43] language I was in mam high
[28:46] school and then they ill treated
[28:50] me so I started
[28:53] hating uh
[28:56] PES now on that day when the pastor was
[29:02] preaching was preaching in
[29:05] B but there was such
[29:09] love that I saw
[29:11] there that pulled
[29:14] me I couldn't understand what he was
[29:17] saying but I could grasp what he was
[29:21] saying that's how now I was taken to be
[29:26] baptized here
[29:30] River so I was baptized
[29:33] there in the name of our Lord Jesus
[29:37] Christ amen
[29:40] amen but then I was the only one that
[29:43] was dressed in a funny
[29:48] way when I look at the other
[29:52] people they are not dressed like
[29:55] myself H uh m knows about
[30:01] it how did I look
[30:13] that was the only young lady in that
[30:20] church but what I want to say is that
[30:23] now the pastor pulled me towards himself
[30:30] and then I would ask
[30:33] questions then he will answer me so he
[30:37] took me wherever he goes went went
[30:44] around until I knew that nationality
[30:48] means
[30:53] nothing so I Started Loving everybody
[30:58] but I said the day I came to the
[31:03] service all my attire was stolen
[31:07] one there was not even a single one that
[31:10] I
[31:13] bought so we live that
[31:17] life uh and I had a
[31:21] car that car was bought only to go to sh
[31:25] beans and go and drink so that at night
[31:28] they must not molest me on my way
[31:36] back then it was converted
[31:40] to the work of
[31:44] God amen amen so uh I was not married by
[31:50] then and then the ad the pastor advised
[31:53] me to get
[31:56] married and there No Sisters in our
[32:01] assembly it was Sister Joan
[32:04] alone very
[32:15] few and
[32:19] because my relatives
[32:24] refused that I should marry in a
[32:27] Christian
[32:30] way they said I must first go to the
[32:33] Mountain
[32:35] School I refused then they said we are
[32:39] not going to get you that woman you
[32:45] want and the Pastor said
[32:48] come so he's the one that took me to
[32:52] soo H to get me this
[32:56] wife that's why
[33:01] that's why the two of
[33:03] us will never depart from the
[33:08] pastor they they can go if they want
[33:14] [Applause]
[33:19] to we know where we come
[33:26] from go
[33:29] can
[33:32] go I will
[33:34] [Music]
[33:36] stick am
[33:39] because not that I love a
[33:43] man but I've seen the
[33:47] word
[33:49] amen during my youth
[33:53] time there was this argument about the
[33:56] Thunders
[34:00] some says Thunders are the
[34:04] virtues so we were uh
[34:10] nicknamed that we uh don't we don't
[34:13] believe in
[34:15] Thunders like right now we are
[34:19] nicknamed that we are
[34:23] preaching
[34:24] uh under world
[34:28] world now the pastor would explain
[34:32] everything about the
[34:34] Thunders that their
[34:38] carrier they
[34:40] carry the
[34:42] voice what is
[34:44] important it's not the Thunder
[34:48] themselves The
[34:50] Voice what
[34:54] was now that I'm making
[34:59] testimony so that the young ones should
[35:02] be
[35:04] encouraged that I was not married by
[35:09] then when I was
[35:11] young my uncle took me to in in
[35:17] D5 and then that that said to
[35:22] me you will never get
[35:24] married you're going to suffer the rest
[35:27] of your life
[35:29] you will never have a
[35:32] child then in respect but I said not
[35:38] me then my uncle chased me out of
[35:41] that now I'm looking for
[35:44] that I'm married I've got a wife I've
[35:48] got five
[35:51] children I'm happy in the
[35:55] word yeah so believers
[35:58] it is true there
[36:01] is a bottomless
[36:05] pit but now when you
[36:08] die I don't know there there there are
[36:11] lot of
[36:14] levels in
[36:17] Hell there's where the devil
[36:21] is that's where his angels
[36:24] are that's where the demons are
[36:28] that's where the lost souls
[36:31] are there's lot of punishment
[36:35] there if there was one who was once a
[36:39] Wich will bear me out that there's lot
[36:43] of
[36:45] yeah and even the pain that is
[36:48] there it's not a physical
[36:51] pain no it's a
[36:55] pain that you cannot
[36:59] describe we don't worship God because we
[37:01] are afraid of that
[37:04] pain we worship God because that is our
[37:11] nature now if there is one that says
[37:15] there is no
[37:17] God you must ask
[37:19] me I grew out here
[37:23] in I was
[37:28] are we together I was well known here in
[37:34] M but God touched
[37:39] me and then there was no turning
[37:43] back friends
[37:46] came you see when when when when you are
[37:50] when God calls
[37:51] you there be lot of
[37:55] Temptation some will come with
[37:58] whiskies with
[38:01] cigarettes with beautiful
[38:03] girls trying to enti
[38:07] me but I just
[38:12] said over I've seen the Lord and I'm
[38:16] taking that
[38:18] step I follow that
[38:20] step I will follow it until Rapture
[38:25] comes if it's a time that should live
[38:28] before
[38:30] Rapture so be
[38:32] it but the where I am
[38:35] now this man that used to stand behind
[38:38] the pull
[38:39] pit our pastor they can name it the way
[38:43] they want
[38:45] to I know him
[38:49] better
[38:52] amen when the Bible says he will see you
[38:56] through
[38:58] he has seen me
[39:00] through amen I'm not a man
[39:03] worshiper I worship the
[39:06] word I always say Pastor if you can
[39:10] preach any other thing than what you are
[39:13] preaching
[39:14] now I'll take my
[39:16] jacket but I wouldn't know where to
[39:21] go because I I you are the one that
[39:24] showed me the truth
[39:27] through his
[39:29] mercy so now if there are church goers
[39:36] here be
[39:40] serious if there are people that just
[39:43] comes to come to the
[39:46] service because you are forced by your
[39:50] parents they are doing a good
[39:53] thing don't ever ever
[39:59] lose that
[40:02] Vision yeah so that that that is the
[40:05] long and short of my
[40:08] testimony that was in
[40:11] 1977 in
[40:13] October I was 30 years of
[40:16] age like I said
[40:19] now so what I am saying to
[40:23] you it's a season thing
[40:28] I'm an old man I want speak just things
[40:31] that are not
[40:34] seasoned I have been
[40:37] trained
[40:40] trained in the word I've been tested in
[40:44] the
[40:44] way so I am
[40:48] seasoned that's why you call me an
[40:51] elder amen amen may the Lord bless you
[40:56] [Applause]
