You are the one Lord Almighty that redeemed us Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We were sinners. &gt;&gt; Our backs turned away from thee. &gt;&gt; But you so loved us that shed your blood. Father, &gt;&gt; we like to thank you. &gt;&gt; Even this morning, Lord, we approach you according to your promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you left this earth, you said to the disciples, &gt;&gt; I will be with you. &gt;&gt; We are holding to that promise. Father, &gt;&gt; that you will be with us. &gt;&gt; And father, here's our brother again &gt;&gt; behind the pullpit. &gt;&gt; And we believe and we faithfully believe &gt;&gt; that you'll be with him, Lord.

Father, thank you, Father. May you be with us also this morning. &gt;&gt; Bless our brother. engulf him. Anoint him Lord Almighty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we read from the book of Revelation chapter 20 from verse 11 to 15. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in th in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; This is the second death. Amen. &gt;&gt; And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Yesterday when we were talking, pastor Mu said something and say our pastor has preached the entire message. When we preach, we are preaching the message he has preached already. We are just preaching to go to the rapture from long time ago until today. So we had a good time. I had a good time with the discosana &gt;&gt; and then we said let's shame the devil. [Music] Then he started to give me the testimony when he was with the pastor and they involved an accident. The car called ro three times and he thought the pastor is dead something in the early 80s. They were just know like sleeping in the car. Both of them they wake up. The car was beyond control. The men of God came out of the car. No either. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this morning, the devil hates this church. [Music] &gt;&gt; He want to see this church scattered. And I'm saying the children of God this morning, don't be a vessel of the devil [Music] to scatter the church. But if you try, you're not going to win [Applause] because this church is the church of the living God. If you defeat it, you must have defeated it. But if the devil failed, you will failed. This church will remain intact. [Music] This church is the judgment seat. When the pastor goes to Africa, to preach this message was bringing judgment to Africa. [Applause] You see this pullpit I'm staying behind. Don't take it for granted. Can I tell you this morning, you are right in the judgment seat. You disobey. you disobey the message behind this pool this morning. There's a white throne judgment waiting for you. Brother says, "Judgment began in the house of God. Those that do not want to hear from the pullpit, there's a white throne judgment waiting for you. Don't be the vessel of the devil. Don't be like Judas. He became the vessel of the devil. Still Jesus said it was better if Jesus was not born. I think I'm talking to the right people. Don't be that. Just be a child of God who is in a relaxation mode knowing that the old ship of Sion is cruising other ships the whales big fishes I mean the whale the fishes or whatever will try to sink it but it will never sink stay inside. God is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning, I'm going to continue where we stopped with our series of the simultaneous appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. But I'm looking at the white throne judgment because now we are on time in the tribulation in the three and a half years of wedding supper in the war of Armageddon in the millennium in the white throne judgment is still time. But after the white throne of judgment, there's no more time. We are heading to eternity. We are in a journey. When you are in a journey, the other people will discourage you, but be like an eagle. Flip your winds. Go to the level where you will hear no noise that can hinder you to continue with your dream. Be like an eagle. Don't be a daspin for gossip. [Applause] You will be injuring yourself. You will be hindering yourself. See the blessings of God. There's a blessings of God waiting for you. There's life eternal waiting for you. Listen to no noise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let me read from the question and answer. I read brother Brennham says brother &gt;&gt; then look you say &gt;&gt; well now &gt;&gt; brother Brenham &gt;&gt; do you mean to tell me there's going to be people that there will be at the white throne judgment is the question brother Brham says the bride will never be judged Are you the bride this morning? You will never be judged, but you will be the judge. She's in Christ. How do you get in Christ? By one spirit. We are all baptized into one body. Is that right? It's talking about you. If you are not going to be judged, but you are going to be the judge, why you worry about the things of the world? The only person who was worrying about the things of the world was Judas because he wanted money. He He worried about money. He worried about money. Do you understand? And the money that he had couldn't assist him with anything, he end up paying himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said judgment was said and the books were open. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Books of sinners. Not the book of the bride, but the books of sinners. In the white throne judgment, only sinners will be judged, but the bride will never be judged. Another book was open which is the book of life. And every man just thus. Is that right? And who was doing the judging? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And his saints, &gt;&gt; the king and the queen, &gt;&gt; the groom and the bride will do. They judge because they've been judged from this pullpit. If the word of God this morning condemns you, repent because the word of God is the church this morning. If you come to service with long face with long face and go home with long face, you were not supposed to be here. This message must change you, must make you something. You come sad. You come sad, you go home happy. That is why we are in the series. You come the same, go back the same problem with you. Not the church, not the pastor, not the preacher, not the person next to you, but yourself. Pastor Mo was preaching, the person you must defeat, it's yourself. [Applause] One is saying, "If things do not go this way in the church, I'm leaving. There's four doors to exit. I know of this man who worked for a certain company. He said, "Yeah, there's a pack date here. I'm not going to work for this company anymore. I'm leaving." They said, "Leave." And he left. And later after 3 months, they call him. They say, "Hey, it was good for you to leave. Since you left our prophet is high now. Do you want to think when you leave this church will stuck 20 souls will come in. [Music] You cannot hold God hostage. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; We are begging no one. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; he came and minister unto the ancients of days whose hair is like a wool and 10,000 times 10,000 comes to him and minister to him in the judment. Here Jesus returns as king and queen. You are the queen. He return with you. Aren't you happy for that? The wedding is over and he's married. He's a king. You are the queen. You standing there with him. And there stand a sanctified bunch. And God said, "Stand to my right side." That's the book was open was sinners. Is the book of the sinners. Get over on my left. Here is ones that had their name written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. I remember the pastor the other day said. If someone is a thief in the church and you start preaching and just pass on the people that steal, those thieves will be the first to complain. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; Because we can't hear about the fat thieves. &gt;&gt; We just hear about the thieves. &gt;&gt; Stop stealing. [Applause] Do you understand? &gt;&gt; I know. I preach about the women of valor. Some men are angry about me. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I have part two of that message. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to preach it again until you get your family right. Why? Because I'm talking about Christ and the bride. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So just brace yourself is coming. Amen. Have you ever seen someone who doesn't have a problem when the message is being preached? is amen. Amen. After amen. Amen. Amen. After amen. The one who has a problem is the one that complains. &gt;&gt; Don't complain. Just repent and do the right thing. Then you will say amen after amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Judas is scariot. &gt;&gt; Judas is &gt;&gt; I'm referring to Judas is The one that was moving with Jesus today his spirit is antichrist. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son of God. Came from God returned to God. Jesus was the son of Pisa. Came from hell and he will return to hell. Jesus was taken the repentant sinner with him. Judas taken and repented with him. It's always the case. Abel &gt;&gt; and Cain, &gt;&gt; Jacob and Esau, &gt;&gt; Jesus and Judas. Today the spirit of antichrist is the one like unto Judas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it is always like that. Now watch Judas is Judas &gt;&gt; was justified by faith and believed on the Lord Jesus and was baptized. And the Bible say Jesus baptized the disciples disciple and it was like that. Jesus himself give them power against the unclean spirit and they went out and they cast out devils. Is that right? And they healed the sick. Is that right? And they come back sanctified, rejoicing, jumping, shouting and praising God. Is that right? And sad. &gt;&gt; Even the devils. Even the devils &gt;&gt; is subject to us. They were happy. And Jesus said to them, don't rejoice because the devil is subject to you. Rejoice when you are named in the book of heaven. That's all you need. I am not referring to any individual. I am referring to the antichrist spirit. As brother say, Judas today is the antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we still together this morning? And Judas &gt;&gt; Judas &gt;&gt; was with them. &gt;&gt; One of them &gt;&gt; called out &gt;&gt; called out. &gt;&gt; Yes. sanctified and his name written in the lamb's book of life. Matthew chapter 10 chapter 10. &gt;&gt; His name is written in the book of life. Our names are written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. He called each one of them and Judas and every one of them right down there he sent them out give them power against unclean spirits. Everything that happened will happen today because history &gt;&gt; repeat itself. One thing I ask God that if I'm standing behind the pullpit, I mustn't preach a social gospel because &gt;&gt; it will take us nowhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; The social gospel &gt;&gt; is the one that does not touch your life. The one that is itching your ears. Them had done went home. them had done went home and received their glorified bodies and lived through the millennium here in the white throne judgment judging those. He said he will separate sheep from the goats. When pastor Mo was preaching last week, he said shepherd will just had all the sheep, &gt;&gt; the goat, the cows, the donkeys. When they are together, you will see their character. You will see the goat jumping the wall. You will see the cows using their horns. You will see the donkey kicking the shepherd. You will see the sheep humble as they are. It's it's natural. That is why when you see the goat acting, preach hard and harder, that goat will never be ashamed. Be careful wherever you are. When you gossip about the man of God, you're like a donkey. You are kicking him, but he's still your shepherd. He's still looking after yourself. Be careful. [Music] It looks like chaotic &gt;&gt; when you know &gt;&gt; knowing that is not chaotic &gt;&gt; the person himself is in chaos I once preached sometimes back about the tube brother is talking about you know he was talking about the the cattle cuts, the cars, the aeroplane and going to the space as the astronaut. &gt;&gt; He said the astronauts they in a tube they are not complaining because that tube is safe. Everyone inside is safe. No one is complaining. What is going up beyond the sky where there's no noise. A child of God. If you are inside, you just go higher and higher. Just be like an eagle. Everything that happen surround you, God knows about them. You did not know that today you will be in the service but God knew. That is why we normally say if the Lord will I will be in the church. But other people live like they own the world. Be careful of what you do, &gt;&gt; of what you say, &gt;&gt; of what you react to that you are not like that donkey. I'm going to read you a story here. Just listen. It's about the white throne judgment. Amen. Let me check the message. Uh or from the church and its condition. &gt;&gt; The church and its condition. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? here. Sometimes ago or about 100 years ago, there was a great Christian lived in southwest United States. &gt;&gt; Great Christian. &gt;&gt; His name was Daniel Kerry. &gt;&gt; Daniel Kerry. &gt;&gt; A wonderful man. a godly man, a sainted man, a real Christian, a man that everybody thought so much of. Such a wonderful person. Did you hear what I said? A wonderful man, a godly man, a sainted man, a real Christian, a man that everybody want to be like him. Daniel and the story goes that he died or went into a trend. And he said as he went up to heaven when he died and when he got to the plegate the caretaker come to the door and say who are you? Amen. Imagine a message believer who you are sure of everything about your life. It happens that you die and the heaven says I don't know you. He said with confidence, &gt;&gt; I'm an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Daniel Curry. &gt;&gt; Daniel Kerry. I've won thousands of souls to Christ. I want to come in this morning. My life's journeys ended on earth. I have no place to go now. That's the way it's coming to you some morning as a sinner. That's the way it's coming to you as a backslider. That's the way it's coming to you. Grieve the Holy Ghost. Holy Spirit away from them. Not be gentle and tender anymore. You haven't cried for years. Amen. &gt;&gt; You haven't cried for years. &gt;&gt; You haven't blushed for I don't know when. And all that modestly gone from you. Sure, &gt;&gt; it's going to come to your door one of this morning. And as the gentle Holy Spirit comes and knocks, why don't you just let him eat? So when Daniel Curry come there to the gate, they went in and said, "We'll see if you got your name here." They looked around. They couldn't find any name. Said there's no Daniel Curry here. A man who brought thousands and thousand and thousand to the Lord. believing God, but when he get to heaven right at the gate, they don't know him. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have your own company, go to work in the morning and then the security officer said, "Sir, I don't see your name. You will start to explain or I will fire you because this is my company and dead and dead but no name. That was Daniel K. Oh, he said surely. He said I'm an evangelist. He said I have one soul to Christ. I've tried to do the things that's right. Oh, he said he said that the caretaker said, "Sir, I'm sorry to tell you, but there's no Daniel car." Sir, I'll tell you what you might do. We have no right here to take your case. He said, "But do you want to appeal your case? You can appeal it. to the white throne judgment. If you want to but said, "We have no mercy here for you at all because we don't have you here. There's no mercy for you. Do you want to appeal your case?" Daniel Kerry said, "Sir, what more can I do but to appeal my case? He said, "Well, then you can go to the white throne judgment and appeal your case." Daniel Curry said, &gt;&gt; Daniel K &gt;&gt; that if he felt itself going through the space for about an hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he he felt his himself going through the space for about an hour said he come into this place. It got lighter and lighter and lighter. Amen. Said further further he went the lighter it got. It was a hund times. Thousand of times brighter than the sun ever shines &gt;&gt; and said he was trembling and trembling. He said said when he got in the middle of that life, he had a voice. Was you perfect on earth? Just come out of a lie. You &gt;&gt; you can deceive us. But when that light come brother, when that light comes, sister everything is clear. He said, "No, I wasn't perfect." He was trembling, but at the initial stage, he had confidence. He got confidence that I'm in charge here. I will work for this place. I belong here. When the light come, he was trembling because he realized that he was a sinner. We have the same people today. &gt;&gt; Said, &gt;&gt; did you always play honest with everybody when they were asking Daniel Kh? &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, did you always play honest with everybody? I won't say those yes that says yes must raise their hand I won't do that don't be scared he said no a few things come to my mind but I wasn't just exactly honest about said no I guess I was not there are people that play perfection, but they're not perfect. &gt;&gt; Did you tell the truth? In every case in your life, he was trembling. I remember some things as you are remembering your things. I've told that I wasn't shady shady. I was never fruitful just exactly. He said then did you take anything that did not belong to you? &gt;&gt; Anything money? anything else that did not belong to you before the light. &gt;&gt; You can hide but before the light said he thought on earth that he was pretty good but he was condemned. He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I just took small money. I just had sweet lies." You know, a human being is a human being. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "No, I've took things that did not belong to." But whom do I talk about here? An evangelist, an honest man, a loyal man, &gt;&gt; a wonderful man, a man who everybody love to be like him. Now he's before the life. Are you aware that this morning you are in front of the light? [Applause] He said, &gt;&gt; "Then you wasn't perfect. &gt;&gt; We want perfect people here. You might have preached to many, but you are not perfect. You don't belong here." He said, "No, I wasn't perfect. Don't worry. I won't say those that are perfect should raise their hand. Don't worry. He said he was looking any minute for a person. He thought he's finished. Maybe when he was passing, the people he preached were there looking at him, him looking at them, wavering saying, "Our master is coming." But our master was denied opportunity because he played holier and that was what He was looking any minute for a blast to come from that great light from where the T rested condemned. Said just then he had a voice behind him that was sweeter than any other mother's voice. said, "He turned to look, and the sweetest face he ever saw, sweeter than any mother's face was standing before him and said, he said, "Father, &gt;&gt; Daniel Kh &gt;&gt; stood for me down on It's true. He wasn't perfect, but he stood for me. He stood for me on earth. Now I'm going to stand for him in heaven. take all his sins and put them over my account. &gt;&gt; Brother, if you can know this, &gt;&gt; how God did things, how God did things, &gt;&gt; you will stop being pompous. Who's going to stand for you &gt;&gt; that day, my brother? &gt;&gt; If you give him away from today, I just can't preach anymore. Do we still believe the word of God? Then the word of God says is by grace. It's not about what you have. &gt;&gt; It's not about the groups you have talking whatever you're talking against the man of God. Stop that thing. It's by grace to go to heaven. There's nothing good that you can do before God. You can please God. We must be God himself. Come in you. Brenam says we are the mechanic. He is the dynamic. We must direct our life. If you think you know the people that know went in hell. Let's appreciate the grace of God. Let's be merciful to one another. Because once that life hit you, nothing you can hide before him. I'm telling you this morning, this pullpit &gt;&gt; is the light. Go and set yourself. [Music] In fact, for you to be worthy, to be in heaven, it's not even your effort. They that wait upon the Lord. Oh my. I remember the story of Solomon. God tell only what you need given unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Solomon ask one thing. &gt;&gt; Lord God, if you can give me wisdom to lead your nations, that's all I need. Those that had opportunity reading the books &gt;&gt; or having knowledge of some kind, I want to tell you this. The best person on earth is the one who can manage conflict. That's what Solomon asked. Conflict management. With David, &gt;&gt; it was not there. &gt;&gt; David, he threw his sword and kill. But with Solomon, he managed to comfort. When a woman come to him, he said, "This one took my child because he has his day." Solomon does not take one-sided story. Brothers and sisters, you take one-sided story and dispute bitterness amongst the children of God. Be careful. One story, you go around, you have mess up with God. But a conflict management person this one story hear this one story get the people together and make a decision but you then is a group of you conflict management is not important in life. We fight in the truth because we had stories with them. Stop that thing. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; What is happening and I have to say it &gt;&gt; without any fear. This church is untouchable. The devil tried &gt;&gt; and tried and tried again. He's still intact. I love Solomon. He was a man of peace. When you are fighting, he called you. What are you saying? What are you saying? stand you also come let's talk for the child belongs to this one that was Solomon conflict management is very important in life if you failed it you failed in life if you failed in conflict management you have failed in life, you become the vessel of the devil and he will use you adequately. &gt;&gt; I don't have a space for that. &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and gossip about someone. don't have a space &gt;&gt; for what we do behind the closed door they will be shown at the throne white throne cross when that light strike oh I'm happy this morning to tell you that you will never be judged in the white throne judgement Only if you accept this judgment, [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; you disobey this one, &gt;&gt; that one is waiting for you. Remember the story of Daniel K. &gt;&gt; A man amongst men. Imagine one day you get to heaven. You don't find brother the one who was the prophet in our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sea shall not hide with a shack. That's why the rapture is of the royal seed has to come first. The royal seed. The one that will be judging sinners has to come first. Once you are in the rapture, you are quite sure you will be in the millennia. You are quite sure you will be the judge. At the white throne judgment you are quite sure you will be in the new city and the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years. Then they were brought up at the white throne judgment. See there's no judgment &gt;&gt; to the royal sea. Hallelujah. There's no judgment &gt;&gt; to you because you listen from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; When your pastor preaches, you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the royals or the predestinated seed of Abraham. Brothers and sisters, stop talking about things you cannot control. Just be a son and a daughter of the living God and say, "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord." That's what you saw. That's where you heading on. The rest John first noticed &gt;&gt; and mentioned the whiteness of his hair. The man young man who was killed at the age of 33. John notice noticed him with the whiteness of his hair. It was white and as bright as this was not because of his age. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus died at the age of 33. But when you look at him at the judgment day, he's not the man of the age of 33. His hair is white and bright. The brilliantly, &gt;&gt; the brilliantly white hair does not signify age but experience. Maturity and wisdom. The eternal one does not age. What is it? Time to God. What is time to God? Time means little to God. But wisdom means much. It is it is as when Solomon called to God for wisdom to judge the people of Israel. Now he is coming the judge of all earth. He will be crowned with wisdom. That is what the white and the hair signify. Those that were in court and so forth. They see the judges having weak white week. That thing signify wisdom and experience and a maturity. Same thing when Jesus come as a judge, we will be with him. That means at the end the woman of valor, it's you. Don't personalize it like I'm referring to someone. I'm referring to you, the church of God or the bride is the woman of valor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be with him &gt;&gt; when he judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you disbelieve the word of God like it's been preached from the pulpit, everything will be clear and you will see yourself denying the word of God until you will say you judge perfectly. &gt;&gt; No one will blame God. You know the confident Daniel Kar was sure what he did here on earth sins. But on the other side, he was lying. He was hating. He He took money from innocent people. Then he thinks that God doesn't see them. Wait for that light. that is more brighter than the sun. When you see that light, you become lighter and lighter and you no longer controlling yourself. You start to face the reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is why it is by grace to be in the message. It's by grace to see the revelation of the seven se by grace to see us in him. If it was not by grace, those that had an opportunity of reading the books of the university until to the highest level that those one they can see it, those one that they couldn't had an opportunity are the one seeing the intelligency of heaven. That's all we need &gt;&gt; to further clarify. &gt;&gt; Notice specifically &gt;&gt; the words of Matthews 25 &gt;&gt; 31-46 31-46. It does not say that shepherd is literally separating sheep from goat. But it says as a shepherd, sheep from goat. Some of the things are unfortunate to &gt;&gt; but they are like that. Maybe others are scared to say that. But I will tell you this morning, where does the church of the living God will be goats? Others know themselves. They are not here for a good cause. Now, brother Brennham says, "If you are a son of the living God, be careful, discern that spirit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I will say it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; These are not sheep &gt;&gt; in this particular area of time. &gt;&gt; Why? Throne judgment in particular area of time. While throne judgment they should in his fold. They heard his voice, his way. Amen. And they followed him. They already have eternal life and cannot come into judgment. Brothers and sisters, a white throne judgment is for the sinners, not for you. You will not come in the white throne judgment in order to be judged. You will be there to judge. Live a good life. When you live a good life, that life is judgment to the people. But this do not have eternal life. And they are in the judgment. And they are allowed to go into the eternal life. But upon the ground they enter in eternal life. Certainly not upon the fact that they already have this eternal life like as does the mean. It means I give these things they happen. simultaneously as I've started this series until today in the end of time. This is what is happening. When you are with Christ Jesus as the bride, there are those people that did not get an opportunity but they are doing good things to you. Then God will say come. But they are not the bride &gt;&gt; but they receive it because they were kind of off his brethren. [Music] They are not his brethren that will make them joint with Jesus. They are not as to anything but life. They share no throne etc with him. Their names must have been in the book of life and not removed. Now because of their love of the people of God, they are recognized and saved. No doubt saved and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamalian they stood for the children in a time of so in other words during the white throne judgment simultaneous occurrences there will be right that are with Jesus Christ on the throne. There will be those that God you know have mercy on them bring them but not being part of the bride just for life eternal. There will be those that are sinners from that time go to hell. Do you understand those things they happen simultaneously? And I repeat, what is happening there in the white throne judgment is what has happened before when you take a decision according to Revelation 12. God has a number of the bride. God has a number of the children of Israel like 144,0004. God has a number of the sinners that will go to hell. God has those numbers. And the Bible says it will go on like that until if possible. They will deceive the very elect. But it's obvious if it was possible. But it's impossible. a child of God remain a child of God will die a child of God will rise a child of God will spend his life eternal as a child of God if you fight me I just smile and say Lord God he's just showing his colors &gt;&gt; because my battle attach. [Applause] Children of God, can I repeat? Relax. &gt;&gt; I learned from the pastor always someone &gt;&gt; can speak at you. Later when you show him the truth, &gt;&gt; he won't say I'm sorry. So for you not to regret rather relax and you will see God doing miracles for he said to the children of Israel through Moses the Egyptians but you see you shall see them theor and the daughter will always be there against Moses when things goes bad they are the first people to But we have Joshua and Ka who said to children of God, the word of God is with Moses. Can we relax and listen to Moses? When we grow up, the elderly will just stand and put in here and say to this one, this one has just about you and he said and then the fight will start and then he'll stand. &gt;&gt; They are those people. lies &gt;&gt; and lies &gt;&gt; and he say this one he's saying about you and this one he's saying this about you &gt;&gt; and then the fight start I've learned to relax in the word of God and let God do the rest John chapter I I had few scriptures but I'm not going to read them. &gt;&gt; John chapter 17 verse 12. Yeah, you can read for us. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them is lost. But the son of pition that the scripture might be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This scripture &gt;&gt; seal everything while this is Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's giving report to the father. He said, "Father, while I was with them in the well, I kept them in my name. Those that you have gave them to me, I have kept. None of them is lost except the son of Perish that the scripture should be fulfilled." Now, tell me and be honest with me this morning. What more do you want? Ah, let me stop here. Answer yourself when you go home. What more do you want? Jesus has kept you. God bless you. [Applause] Let's stand to our feet and sing a hymn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Single mayful. [Music] Oh, &gt;&gt; you are [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] coming. [Music] [Music] Oh, glory. [Music] [Music] I love you.

He knows what we want, what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we just want to give the Lord all the glory and honor. As I'm going to request my brother just close here just to pray and thank the word of the Lord as we prepare to go to the baptism. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we just bow our heads? Our gracious eternal heavenly father. Our [Music] pastor, the angel of this church. There's nothing new that is going to come from heaven. &gt;&gt; Everything that we need is already here. &gt;&gt; The word, the revelation, the the answers to our questions. Hallelujah. They are always coming from behind this pullpit. He has done a very gallant and good work of spreading your word maka and laying the standard heavenly father say each and every brother each and every preacher every pastor in the message they are looking up to that standard because you have called him on a higher plane and gave him a special revelation of your word indeed we are happy Lord Almighty to have such a pastor Lord Almighty Father to guide and to lead this church into eternity.

We are in the service Lord of baptism. We've got our sisters, our brothers who are always taking decisions &gt;&gt; to say that before the coming of the Lord, I just want my name to be recorded as well and waiting for that rapture. &gt;&gt; We pray for them. Gracious Lord, this is the separation be between the two kingdoms. The other kingdom of darkness is fighting. Even when they are taking that decision, there was a fight that was there. But father, we like to thank you that the God of heaven has warned their souls today. &gt;&gt; They are going to be baptized, precious Lord. And the devil again is losing because gracious heavenly father, these souls, father, they are going to be kept Lord in this word. We thank you, Father. Bless each and every one of them as we are going through the proceedings of the baptism. Bless the word which is going to be read even now father and we give God all the glory and honor in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our brother will just read the word for us and we'll continue with the baptism. Amen. [Music] Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. [Music] Leave water. Restless. [Music] Amen. [Applause] [Music] I know I am full and We will [Applause] Rest and [Music] he was [Music] full. Oh. [Music] Good lord. &gt;&gt; We will request our preacher, brother Marza, just to come and pray for us. God bless you. Because when the word is nice and going to the belly, it get bitter. Sometimes heavenly father, you do things contradicting ourself because Lord God, you know better than us. We may think about everything of this world or how to acquire them, but you taught us to look up to thee. Brother Brandham said, "Everything you see with a naked eye, it has a beginning, it will have an end." So we must look to the eternal inheritance. Lord God, here are two souls, heavenly father, whom you chose in this earth time. We know and we believe that one of the days the last sheep will come into the fold and the rapture will take us back home. when they come, heavenly father, we have that hope. Bless them, heavenly father. Equip them, Lord God, with the heavenly equipment so that they may be able to see the devil when he's still a far off. Lord God, I pray once more for the entire church. This church, heavenly father, you chose it before the foundation of the world. The devil may try whatever tricks he has. We know he never conquered. He will never conquer us. We love you so much. And I pray for our pastor. Such a man of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Help him heavenly father. Every moment we know when this moment like this come you show him more better and more clearer. That is why heavenly father even if the te the devil may try to put a stray he will say we must come back to life. We love you so much and we put everything Lord unto your capable hand. In the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Bazalwan. We have come to this time and uh we like to thank you for coming. Hallelujah. And we also pray for the Lord to be with you as we are driving back home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My brother, I'm just going to ask you for two songs. Amen. The last song we just uh released the church. Those songs that are in your heart. God bless you. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; I am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home. Oh, when they be I got the king. I will raise their heavenly in the city in the sky.
