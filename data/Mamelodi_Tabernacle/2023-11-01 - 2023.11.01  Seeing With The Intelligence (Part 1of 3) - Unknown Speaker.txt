TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] we we thank the Lord this evening since we arrived is being a a blessing after blessing and uh first time I met our pastor uh my [Music] pastor I met him once in South Africa but just briefly I think he was SE next to the door I couldn't even see him properly but then when we met in K last time then he invited me and so we arrange for uh our visit here bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father we are so grateful that we have a father like you an eternal father and it was good in your eyes before the foundation of the world to make a choice and the as the word says we were chosen before the foundation of the world this evening we are in this little spot of the Earth but we believe that greater is that is in us as we are turning to your word we are expecting some blessings upon us bless the CH the pastor of the church bless our pastors that are seated [Music] around bless the brothers and sisters as we start to hear from you the word of eternal life may you undertake for us weake of this bread of life tonight in Jesus Christ name amen amen let's turn to First John chapter 1 you may be seated God bless you I will try to go slow the Lord will unless God decides to go faster so the prophet speaks of the intelligence time intelligence time intelligence time yes we we will read it as we continue let's pick up uh subject let's pick up a subject as the prophet preach about I have heard and now I see amen amen so we believe that this is the same time or the intelligence we have heard we have [Music] seen now we need the intelligence uh to be able to understand the things that we have seen hearing seeing and [Music] intelligence you can hear about the thing and yet you still don't know it is hearing then you come to see and still you don't understand you only see it then you need intelligence so it's a threefold see hearing intelligence which is the third the third amen now I read in the book here of the Prophet The Book of the Prophet now if we read reading the Bible we have seven Church ages now seven Church ages speak of time of the churches and the Bible says a blessed is he that an ear that is throughout the church ages that means it's an era of hearing amen amen so he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches that's in every Church age but after the churches it's no more hear we come to a seeing and intelligence now I think the revealed sevenes is the intelligence because the Seven Seals is Christ and brother says he is the seals that were revealed now that is the intelligence as we look into the books here God bless you now the prophet speaks here uh Christ is revealed in his own word is the spoken word then he says uh see now the vision he speak of the vision coming down to he says coming down to intelligence he says then it started right back the church come from the feet coming up now it's in the head time amen and now not the feet now but beyond the body and in the book of Christ is the mystery of God he calls it the original headship of [Music] Christ over the amen now the mind that is now in the bride is the intelligence [Music] Christ for he say the bride knows what to do with the word and he says the bride has the Lord so they have the intelligence not just hearing see but the intelligence amen that's why we are not confused we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we are going amen so now the prophet speaks then it started down coming up now he says you can't see with your hands yes it's part of the body you can't see with the ears yet it can hear you can hear but you can't see with your ears you can't see with the nose you can't see with the lips yet it speaks that was the Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time you saw you seeing and intelligence are closed together because if you are looking at the thing you need intelligence to tell you what is that thing [Music] you now without the intelligence you'll be looking but yet not making out what it is then he says now this is the eye time the seeing and there isn't one moving faculty beyond the [Music] eye so beyond the eye there is nothing moving it's intelligence nothing moving there they hearing and the seeing have brought um the whole matter to the [Music] mind now brother says mind that was in Christ as the Bible says let the mind that was in Christ be in you and brother says that mind that was in Christ is your [Music] [Applause] soul because first thing first thing he says if you are looking you must be standing on the right place there are things you can't see unless you come to a certain place and the Bible say there was one day I can reading the Bible here you know you know you've got to choose the right place one time he took uh James John and Peter he took them up to the mountain because he was going to show them the supernatural now for them to see the supernatural supposed to come [Music] up am and in the Book of [Music] Revelation he said to Job come up and I will show you things after the brother he called John joh says Revelation 4 after these things I he a door was open so you see uh this place was sealed up between the church ages and the seals there was a door and that that that that's why in The Vision brother B came and Cho off the top of the pyramid to reveal what is within amen so it was not just a pyramid but it was sealed up amen you see Enoch he was the one who build that structure the pyramid because he was the seventh man and the pyramid has seven steps so the seventh man from Adam bu the pyramid and no one could interpret what is there in the pyramid until there was the seventh [Applause] messenger so you see the seventh one but the seventh messenger he interpreted hallelujah amen so while we are looking at these things I'm going back to the Book of Genesis uh you you first find the right place to see amen and the Book of Genesis I will turn to uh chapter 13 oh let's start by reading uh chapter 19 chapter 19 verse 27 ver and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the [Music] Lord there was a reason why he went to that place because there he stood before the Lord so he went back to the same place the reason he he he came here the Bible says verse 28 and he looked towards Sodom and and toward all the land of the and beh low the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a f Abraham knew that for him to see Sodom bending he must come to a certain place and that certain place it's where he stood before the Lord and from that position he could see Sodom right as we we are standing before the Lord in the end time after the Rapture we will see the world I believe that okay okay now he chose that position and uh while we are in this scripture chapter 13 says chapter 13 verse 14 ver 14 and the Lord said unto Abraham after Lord was separated from him you know go before God gave him the land he showed him the land because brother says you need to have eyes first [Music] we will read it in the books here so so Abraham ABR stood there from that place and the Lord said for all the land which you see that means you are going to inherit the land which you see I must see the seals before I can inherit the seals amen now I will turn to the book here Look Away to [Music] Jesus the prophet speaks here page 23 he says the thing I want to ask you tonight is when you look what do you see amen when you look what do you see because you are going to inherit that which you see like if you see six seals you will inherit six you see seven but he says what do you see when you look amen that is Look Away to Jesus what do you see when you look that only depends on what you are looking for amen am not just looking but what you are looking for now what will determine what you are looking for is your position amen if if it's a prophet you will always look for the way to come it depends and again the prophet says here it depends on what you are looking at amen what do you see he says John the Baptist looked away amen now we are going to go to the scriptures that we have read brother say there was Jesus standing there and John couldn't recognize him he was standing right there and John says I didn't I couldn't recognize him now says until there was a sign now looking at John at Jesus looking at Jesus he was looking at a now he look so ordinary John could not recognize him as the L of God you see and then he looked away then he saw him when he looked away then he saw the Spirit coming like a d but that's when he looked [Applause] away amen amen amen because looking away he would be he would be looking from [Music] somewhere you know if you read page the Faith Works is Faith Express brother say you you are a Triune person aun Body Spirit Soul now he says the soul is where you live that is the that is where you live now for John to to to look away it has to be from one place that is the soul let's repeat with his eyes not recognize with his eyes so he had to look away to pick him up from the superatural point by reading about the seals I don't see anything it's reading reading don't reveal to you you just end up reading the Jews is they read about the coming of the [Music] Messiah then it was when they were reading then he came they continue reading when he [Applause] was it's not just reading and the Maj the three wise men they came from the East and as they followed St their inward bodies their theop were in Orit with the star so as the Stars went this way went so now these three men they were [Music] L now when they reach Jerusalem they went into the synagogue and in the synagogue they found them [Music] reading that he shall be born in Bethlehem and the ma said where is he that is born King of the Jews amen now in the synagogue they produced the scroll and started [Music] reading and the ma said because they knew it was now not the reading [Applause] time is they read about it they heard about it now they are saying where where is he am they didn't ask for the reading they didn't ask for the reading they didn't they for him you know if you read in the Bible we we look at Philip how Philip said to Nathaniel come and see he never said come and [Music] read amen come and see what the one we have read about the one Moses wrote about the one the prophet prophesied but now this time it's not a prophecy it's not [Music] reading so that's the difference now he says Nathaniel he never said come and read the prophecy is now fulfilled the scure is now a [Applause] man it was reading not reading time seeing time because it was not a manifestation we have now we see then they said come and see amen and now the mes three wise men in the temple they received a scripture but their mission was they have come not to read but to see that was the difference so after a minister has read after a minister in the has read the scripture the saw that St again amen for they said we have seen his and the Pharisees have read his scripture now it was from scure [Applause] to that's why we have Seven Stars from a scripture to a star now you must find the star of the scriptures and follow the star of the script of your scriptures so the scriptures produce the St the now they just followed amen until when they went out of the denomination they saw the St [Music] again when they separated because you must separate first then they saw the star and they rejo and follow the star amen and the star LED them to where he is and John says I did not know him like the M when he looked away he saw a spirit coming like a dve amen and the spirit pointed him out and John said this is my record this is my record this is the Lamb of God Amen and brother says one time Abraham he looked away then he saw the three balls of light he saw the three HS of [Applause] light when he looked when John looked down he saw a man Jesus he he saw the coming then he was watching the [Music] superal until it reached the Lord Jesus Christ when he recognized and said this is the L of God and he said now I bear record this is my record I have seen the supernatural now a child of God is a twofold [Music] being the Lord Jesus was double he was twofold one Jesus is the Earth and God is the spirit now John look around amen that's how we recognize the prophet amen now the prophet says [Music] here you know here in another book he say you know men lives men that your place is your soul your place is your soul yes sorry sorry God bless you even in the book of in the book of The Rapture the prophet say so uh page okay it says um I think I'll find it he say inside of you we are trying to look at the place inside of you there is a place it's called the soul he says that's what you [Music] are
