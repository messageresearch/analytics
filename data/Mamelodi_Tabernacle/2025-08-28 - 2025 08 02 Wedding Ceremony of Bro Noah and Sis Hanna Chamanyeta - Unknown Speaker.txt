[Music] &gt;&gt; Can we give them a hand of appreciation? [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay, I will I will ask everyone to stand. Can we all stand? you eat it. Uh [Music] uh today if uh if you don't know how to rejoice, how to be happy, you can learn from the neighbor next to you. Yeah. [Music] If you see someone next to you who is quiet and heavy, just kick him. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, I don't know how to rejoice. I know. You must learn. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to learn, if you don't want to learn, you are jealous. Amen. [Applause] You know the first person to be kicked out of heaven, it was because of jealousy. [Music] So if we find you jealous here, we kick you out. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Okay, just before we start. Uh for us, everything begins with the word because in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. So we we will begin with the word. The word of God is the foundation. and the capstone of every marriage. Any marriage which is not done according to the word of God is not a marriage. So we will start with scripture. We are still standing. Uh if I can have time somewhere here uh something that can help me to check time so that I don't take your yours just use my own time. I don't want to take your time. In weddings people come and say the food was cold. Ah, that pastor took long. I don't want to be blamed after the wedding. In fact, the time you'll be blaming me, I'll be in the aeroplane. No, that's when it's not working. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you. The first book we can read is the book of Genesis. Genesis chapter 2 uh when the first wedding happened. Amen. That was the first one. Amen. And we have the today one is showing us what will be the last one. So Noah and Hana, you are right in the middle between the first wedding and the last wedding and you are showing us the image so that we see and understand what was done in the Bible. and we have the revelation of what will happen. Amen. Genesis chapter 2 uh verse, let us just take a short one. Let's take it from verse 23. And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman." And she was taken out of a man. [Music] Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. [Music] Amen. Let's take also uh Matthew 19. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you will if you are a Bible student you will notice that there is the marriage topic are not is not spoken a lot in the Bible. You'll find it in the beginning of the Bible. Then you have to travel to the middle of the Bible that is Jesus in Matthew 19. &gt;&gt; And then Paul will come back to the same words of Jesus. Then you will only find it again in the book of Revelation chapter 19 again. Chapter 19. &gt;&gt; Okay. Matthew 19. &gt;&gt; Matthew 19. &gt;&gt; Uh let me take just from verse four. And he answered and said unto them, "Have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female?" and said, "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they twin shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twin, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put a sand Fore [Music] speech. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe I can ask pastor you can pray for us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father God, we have gathered this morning to witness the wedding of Noah and Hana. We want to rejoice with them, Lord, and Jo with the family. &gt;&gt; We thank you for your word that what is happening this morning is something that you instituted right from the beginning. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are witnessing. Lord, be with us. with the minister &gt;&gt; as he unveils the word for us. &gt;&gt; We want to rejoice together, Lord. &gt;&gt; That your word will stand forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was in the beginning &gt;&gt; is now and will be forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lead us Lord in Christ Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I want to ask you to sit the the crowd can sit first so that you see the couple before they sit down. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. I think now can we have them seated? We say some few words. Amen. This is how a great day looks like. Even the dress is different. You need help to carry it around. The look is different. just because the day is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Shalom saints. Uh before we proceed into uh giving the blessing to this couple uh to live together as husband and wife. That's why we are here. for the same God who has blessed us in this journey to bless them as well so that they can be strong in the journey they about to start now. That's the same God who has blessed their parents to make it in the way because without God we can do nothing. I I I just want to say some few words and I know sometime the maybe it can be an approach that can be different [Music] but if you don't agree with me just bear with me and pray for me because today it's me who's here. Amen. So by the grace of God I want just to share some few things from the word of God. You we have read two scriptures. Uh why we are reading the Bible? Because marriage is a divine institution. Marriage is not a government institution. [Music] Marriage is not a cultural institution. But marriage is a divine institution. Amen. And the apostle Paul, &gt;&gt; if you look at the Bible, &gt;&gt; I think only mainly three men, three men have touch the the topic of marriage. The first one was Moses. [Music] Then it was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then it is Paul. only them. And there is a particularity with the three men that they made a visible encounter with the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses met the pillar of fire. Then he was commissioned and he had the authority. to establish the rules. That's why he could speak about this great institution. [Music] Then Jesus himself God made flesh could speak about it. Then it is Paul. And Paul also like Moses met the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Beside them no one can just come and touch it. You need a special divine commission for you to touch this matter because it's the first official institution made by God like I love to say the highest covenant between men that can be established is marriage. marriage because it has got impact in your life spiritually, naturally, physically, financially. Amen. In everything, it declare as well even your destiny. Your your marriage can affect your destiny. important. Amen. It is a divine institution. And when I speak about that, I always remember there is uh the story that many of us have read about Mr. Ford. &gt;&gt; Mr. Ford. &gt;&gt; Yes. Ford, the one who makes the cars. &gt;&gt; Mr. Ford &gt;&gt; moving on the road with his overall and he find a young man there with a lot of uh oil in his hands going under the car, above the car, on top of the car, [Music] trying all his best to fix. And you know when you get into a garage, the man you see dirty, you think is the one who knows the job. But most of the time, the dirtiest man is the learner. Because the one who knows the job, he know where to touch. He does not use a motor oil as a lotion. Okay, I'm just trying to make you laugh. So, Mr. Ford approached the young man, asked him, "Man, what are you doing?" I said, "No, this car is giving me problem. I bought it. Now I have to fix it every time. I've been trying here on the side of the road. But no one nothing is happening. And then Mr. Ford was wearing a suit like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he look at him and he say come from under the car. Then the man look at him. He look at his suit. Say what do you know about me? Say young man touch here. Then touch again here. Then touch there. Then go in there. Then start the car. Then when he start it was on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he asked him, "Who are you?" Say, "I am Mr. Ford. I am the engineer, the conceiver, the conceiver of this engine. &gt;&gt; So I know how it works. Can we give God a hand of appreciation? Sometimes when something is not working, take it back to the one who conceived it because he know why he made it. and how he made it. That's why we have this couple here. We want the conceiver of marriage to address them. Amen. That's why my little topic this morning will be for this cause. for this cause. If you read the book of Ephesians, when Paul touched this matter, Ephesians chapter &gt;&gt; 5 verse 31, &gt;&gt; he repeat the same words of Jesus and say, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Amen. Are we together? Now Paul the apostle &gt;&gt; he says when he want to introduce marriage he say for this cause so marriage is done for a cause &gt;&gt; amen that cause God who notice it he made an assessment. [Music] Are we together? Because in the beginning when you look at the book of Genesis and you will see that's the reason why many time marriages are collapsing. They are failing. Somebody asked me a question. Pastor, can you just tell us? Why do we have so many cases of divorces and there is there are marriages as well that are just seen from the outside when we look at the people outside they are married but in their hearts in their hearts they have been divorced for a long time they are just visible Mary but in reality they are no more and the brother the people were asking me what is the reason when you go to a doctor there must be an examination and assess the matter and find the cause if you don't find the cause that made God to establish marriage marriage then you will never be able to have a blessed and successful marriage. The only the reason of of divorces and so forth. It is just because of a wrong marriage. People got married for the wrong reasons and a wrong reason cannot sustain you for a long time. Amen. Do you want us to talk now? &gt;&gt; So today I believe after officiating this marriage we will reofficiate many marriage because you can restart with the right cause the right reason and you will make your life a blessed life. How many believe God here? Let us solve the matter in very few minutes. &gt;&gt; Now listen when God established marriage in the book of the beginning Genesis &gt;&gt; which mean the beginning God made and it was the man was alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God came down he was visiting that man all the time. He He was there. He was alone. And God realized he said to himself that it's not good for the men to be alone because he knew himself that it was not good for him to be alone. Are we together? He realized if it is not good for me to be alone then this man is suffering and God had to make a plan. It's not like these brothers today. Brother, I'm not getting married. I'm fine. I know how to cook. I I can do this. I'm fine. Brother, you are not fine. Because when when God says it is not good, it is not good. You can't make it good. So, God already say it's not good. [Applause] It's already charged. Brother, the matter is settled. &gt;&gt; It's not good, brother. You must repent and believe God. That is not good. No, brother. I'm helping my family. I'm okay. You know, my my family has worked a lot for me. I must also and now brother is not good. Even for God himself it was not good himself before he takes care of his family. The Jews he come get married first before he goes to his family say I must first get married. Are we together? Now when God come and establish the matter and say for this cause, I want us to speak for a few minute about that cause. Now that cause is was not you there. The man that was there was Adam. So remove yourself in your environment and travel back and be in the environment of Adam then we will understand together. Now let me say I will shock some people. When Adam was in need to have a wife, he did not know himself. But God knew and he say it's not good. Okay. Adam was not eating cooked food [Music] at that time. He was given the fruits to eat. So what Adam needed was not someone who will cook. &gt;&gt; Hey people are not saying amen. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; It's the Bible. &gt;&gt; You move around with the Bible. Now when we say it, you don't want to say amen. Adam was not cooking. He did not he he was not eating the cooked food. He was eating the fruit. So the need of marriage was not because he need somebody to cook. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, I'm tired of cooking. I need a wife. That's the problem because when that wife will come if she cannot cook like your mama then you start saying ah I made a mistake. You see you got married for the wrong reason because the one who established marriage he did not make it to resolve that problem. Who told you the best cooks in the world are women? &gt;&gt; No, they are men who can cook more than women. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I used to tease my wife. I used to tease my wife and when people say, "Hey, your food is nice." and tell her why you don't tell them I'm the one who taught you sometime you can be the one okay can we move on am I talking right it's not me it's not me I'm talking about the word because you need to resolve these things to solve them so that things work well now at that time Can I move on? Adam &gt;&gt; did not have a wardrop. &gt;&gt; The Bible even say he was naked. Am I talking right? [Laughter] So he was not ironing. So he was not washing. He had nothing, just one suit forever. He was busy moving around. So he he did not need somebody to do washing. But God says is not good. So the reason of God bringing a wife to Adam is not because Adam needed washing. It's not because Adam was tired of washing. [Music] But it was for a different reason. I can list them. We will stay here the whole day and we will realize that 80% of people got married for the wrong reason. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me take another main reason. [Music] At that time when Adam had to needed a wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Adam got a commission from God that he should multiply but it was not through sex. So Adam &gt;&gt; was not &gt;&gt; uh meant to multiply &gt;&gt; by sex. [Music] So when God saw the need of having a wife for Adam, it was not even for sex because there was no sex involved at that time. reproduction was to come by the word. So marriage was not to satisfy a sexual appetite. Hey, I see you. You are you are getting heavy. But don't worry, don't worry. You will come back. That's the reason why when people get married for with those reason they end up on the side of the road because they realize that afterward that they cannot be satisfied with all those reasons why they came there because the marriage had Another supernatural reason given by God. Adam needed a helpmate. He needed somebody to help him because God had given to him a mission. He had a vision to fulfill. He had a task. He had a place to get to. God realized that he cannot get there unless I give him somebody who will be him. Who will be able to carry that burden for him? Because somebody who must help you has to be stronger than you. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Because if you are strong enough, you don't need help. How can I seek help from someone who's weak? How I need somebody strong? If I want to carry this, if I want to carry this pullpit, I will check someone with muscles, I will not catch someone who is small. No, I rather do it myself because if I get someone who's weak, he will make the job more difficult. I need a man who a person who strong and God saw God saw that the man is weak without a woman. [Music] Man is vulnerable without a woman. It is better I kill the man so that a woman come out because she is the secret. of the creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my &gt;&gt; the secret of the creation &gt;&gt; was the woman. She was there but she was not visible. And when she comes out, the story of redemption changes. That's what the church is. That's why Paul says this mystery is great. I speak concerning Christ in the church. Without you, Christ has got no hands. Without you, Christ has got no legs. Without you, Christ has got no mouth. You are the ground force. Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When there is a battle, he needs you to pull the sword &gt;&gt; and fight the battle with him. That's the mystery of marriage. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That a wife come because that I'm coming there because actually marriage revolves about the woman. If we don't understand that will not make prosperous men. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So God needed somebody who can help this man get to his destiny. Hallelujah. God needed somebody who can work around Amen. Who can become the perfection? Because that man is not perfect without the woman. God is not perfect without you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why that day when Adam woke up and he saw that woman my my my like today. &gt;&gt; When Noah sees Anna my my my hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a different amen. &gt;&gt; This is now Adam speaking. Not God speaking. This is now Adam speaking. Say God this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. It mean there were other times that God brought things to Adam. But Adam was just saying okay this good you lion and this is you and what I know this is a good car. This is a good house. But this time, God. Amen. You have brought something different. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you have brought to me things, but this time it's something different. This time it's born of my bones, flesh of my flesh. Because God did the first surgery. That's why he's the great physician. Put an estasis in Adam, slept, cut there, took out the rib or whatever. Though we have sometime different approaches. Amen. But he just took out something out of Adam and made another person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam had to lift his hands. Put his hands up so that they open just by the heart to take that lovely being. And God had to take Jesus at the cross and lift his hands so that he can open so that they can take out you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Amen. And as you were standing there, she was standing there. Adam say yo yo yo yo this is bones of my bones flesh of my flesh. There is something that I want to say there. Adam &gt;&gt; was not admiring the beauty of Eve but she he was admiring the nature. cuz her nature was his nature. And I want to say something. The flesh, he say there will be one flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh let us not be cannal. I think Hana is not the flesh carnally of Noah. &gt;&gt; She is the flesh of [Laughter] [Music] Yeah. the the the physical body is made of her parents. But there is something of her that has been in That's why you find her. &gt;&gt; It's because she was containing something that you were missing. You felt that you were looking for what you were missing and you find it in her. Oh, it mean tomorrow there's no way you realize it's not the one [Music] &gt;&gt; because the flesh is of a short time. You look so nice today. I want to tell you that when we got married, we also looked nice. No, don't think we were like this. Time flies, man. It just look like yesterday. But as time goes, we start getting tired. The hair start missing some of the place. It start turning gray. The shape is changing. Brother, I was I was also wearing trousers size 3230. I was there, brother. Don't worry. It will change. Time will come. Amen. Oh my. Are we together? &gt;&gt; The flesh is of a short time. the your wifeh she will just change after a few days ah don't worry I will see you next year it's like Elohim told to Abraham I will come this year then she will start walking differently because because [Music] when you look at her the shape will change But you are not getting married to the shapes. &gt;&gt; You are not getting married to &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But you are bringing together a substance that will build your destiny together. So today uh to Hana you you you are the vision You are the version that your family has has made. &gt;&gt; Your parents worked, your pastor worked and the church worked. Then it you became what you are. So you are the image of that background. You are the vision that background has produced. But where you are going, you will become the version that this woman will produce. And let me tell you, you will become the better version of yourself. [Music] &gt;&gt; The same as to Hana what she is today. The image of what the parent has done. They have worked. They have put something. The pastor has worked. The parent have worked. And you have become what you are. Now the father takes her by the hands and give her to you. [Music] It is for her to become the best version of herself. Are we saying amen to that? Amen. That's what marriage has established. Like I was saying yesterday there to the brother that love is not to admire. That's not love but love. It's a divine nature that comes out of you that makes you able. die for the sake of the other because John says there is no other way of loving than to lay your life my my am I talking good sense here there's no other way of loving than taking your life down for the others to live so to Love mean you don't expect anything from the other. You are just loving. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet will say when love. Hallelujah. When love projects, amen, it project then sometime you start getting tired. Then suffering grace take over. It mean you no longer see the mistakes. That's how God loves us. He does not worry of what we have done, of what we will do. He just love us. &gt;&gt; No, this wife I used to love him. I used to love her. But the things she has done, it has taken all the love away from me. Ah this man I used to love him but the thing he has done has taken all the love away from you. mean you never loved to begin with because love is eternal. Oh my. Hallelujah. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Can we give God a hand of appreciation? Hallelujah. Now, as I'm closing &gt;&gt; just for the sake of time, &gt;&gt; I'm not closing because I'm done. Just for the sake of time take of eternity. The two end to bring eternity together [Music] to make the full cycle. Amen. &gt;&gt; As God coming together with the men That's why in this evening time, God has sent a prophet [Applause] and he closed his ministry with a rainbow sign under the topic of marriage and divorce. Because he said because marriage is a covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That respect covenants [Music] &gt;&gt; because there are marriages according to covenants. [Music] Marriage was done according to the the first covenant between God and man. according to the middle covenant between God and man, which is the covenant of sin. And now we have crossed over to another covenant where marriage is no longer a marriage in sin [Music] but it's a marriage that explain the purpose of God as Jesus said. Have you not heard that the one who made them in the beginning, he made them one? One block, &gt;&gt; one unit, but male and female. Amen. &gt;&gt; For what reason? so that they can return back into that city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe God has given a destiny to Noah. God has given a destiny to Hannah and God knew that they have to come together for them to reach that place. Today we are going to join them together to make this effect transfer that blessing to them so that they can walk together to that city. Amen. Number one, marriage is eternal &gt;&gt; because it's based on upon love. Because love is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; The cause of marriage that was mentioned by God, it is for a help in order to fulfill the mission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he say the man is the head. the wife is the body. So if the w the man is the head, it's because the man has a vision. He has a mission. So if you don't have a vision, you don't have a mission. You stop being the head. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A man must have a vision. A man must have a mission. [Music] You know that as we always say there is no bad troops [Music] but there are bad generals. There was you know one of these people were talking and he say I I think speaking about one of the generals the name will come and he say it's better I have I have an army of an army of dogs led by a lion then having an army of lion of lions led by a dog. That army will never win even if they are lions. But the leader is a dog because the army is waiting for the leader to jump, but the leader just put his tail back. But but the dogs when they see the lion leader jumping they also play the jump they believe that they are also lions. Amen. Amen. Amen. Great leaders make great teams. Amen. Isn't it? So if you are a great husband, you will make a great home. You will make a great wife. Be a man with a vision. Be a man with a mission. Be the head of your home. Have confidence that you are the one who will lead this home to a good show. And God will bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I saying the truth? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the role of the man. The woman being the body. If you see a head moving around without a body, you'll run away. You'll say it's a monster. It's a ghost. It can only make sense when the body is there. Hallelujah. Because the body make the proud of the head. The body is able to take what the head has and manifest it. Like the church is able to take what Jesus has and manifest it. Jesus said, "The works that I do, you shall do them and even greater works." So a man must not be intimidated when his wife is achieving greater things. Actually that how it must be because Jesus said greater works shall you do. [Applause] Amen. You must be proud to see your wife achieving greater things. You need to empower her. You need to push her, to move her to fulfill that because she is the manifestation of the vision in you. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. That is submission. Submission is not to kneel down. I'm not against that. That if you that what it's done, it's okay. That's not what the word meant. When he says submit does not mean you kneel down. Does not mean if the husband say you don't go to church, you don't go to church. Does not mean if the husband hit you and say don't tell the pastor. If you tell the pastor, you'll marry the pastor. And the sister is suffering there. Say, "My husband said, "Come out. Come out. Come out. You must be set free." Amen. Are we together? But submission, it's a it's a compound word. [Music] Sub okay mission whatever it is brother they will understand so it's a submission so it mean I am not fulfilling my own mission I am fulfilling the mission of somebody above me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I always say to sisters, if your husband is a doctor, &gt;&gt; if your husband is a doctor, you you stay there in the kitchen cooking the whole time. It's your problem because they're in the hospital. He needs somebody who has done a hospital management. Me I will advise you to register for hospital management courses because that woman who is the hospital manager will become his friend all the time. &gt;&gt; But you you say I'm helping my husband with the food but he can go to the restaurant but you you are helping with the food. The help that he need is somebody to pick that thing and carry it at a better level. That was just in bracket. God bless you. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. We'll speak some other things some other time. [Music] Now, we don't want the food to be cold. We know they can't wait &gt;&gt; to be married. How many loves the word of God? How many appreciate God? Let's give God a hand of appreciation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can we just have a a song? [Music] just a short first. Then uh one of our elders will come to pray for the word and we'll begin our second section of the service. How many have loved the word of God? How many believe these things? Let's give God the hand of appreciation. Amen. [Music] Join together. No [Music] can put the sun down. There's no that could ever [Music] let us [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] why God has joined together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just do little [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] save us from his love.

Oh God, every time they will kneel down and pray in their home, may you be closer to them. Every time they will need something, may you provide for them. Open the windows of heaven and may this couple be an example of success in this age where marriages are collapsing and are being a failure. May them be the marriage that shows the way to other people to know what God want in this day. The will of God for our lives. I bring them unto you for more blessings. You the God of Abraham and Isaac and Moses. You the God of William Brham and our God, I pray that you have your hands upon them. Let that great rainbow, that great compass company of angels surround them. Father, be the gates of their life. Be the gates of their home. Be oh God the roof of their place. Everywhere they go, be with them. Father, give them a blessed family, blessed children. Oh God, make them fruitful in everything they will do. Whatever they will go, open doors for them. Whenever they will knock, be there before them. Whoever come to them, be in between them and the world and keep them for you, oh God. When we will come and visit them, we will see them prospering. We shall glorify your name. Oh God, they have come this way. Their parents came together and bring them to this life. Now it is their turn, Lord, to bring forth another generation. Make it possible unto them. Let them take this word, this message, and transfer it to their children. Another generation to come will look up to them. I bless them as your servant in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I declare them blessed. I declare them prospering. I declare them satisfied. I declare them joyful in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I rebuke every evil plan of the enemy against their life and cast that far away from them in Jesus name I have prayed. believing and trusting in you with your love that you will never let them down. It is in that mighty and powerful and gracious and wonderful name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and our Savior, that I pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we give God a hand of appreciation? Amen. Now with the authority that was given to me as a minister of the gospel, a husband and a wife. Amen. You are no more two. You are one. [Music] The one who made them at the beginning made them one. Can you say amen yourself? Amen. Now the bridegroom can greet the bride. Is the greeting time. The city has arrived. The king of the city is there. He will show &gt;&gt; to the audience what was vain behind this veil. Brother Jerusalem is here. Amen. You can show us the city. [Music] That's how it goes.
