Description:
Title: Accessing the rights to the tree of life Vol 2
Preached By Elder Neo Makgareetsa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 15 September 2024.

The Elder read the following scriptures:

Revelation 1: 16 | 1 Corinthians 15: 45-47

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about having access to the tree of life.

The prophet says the tree of life is a person and the tree of knowledge of good and evil was a person. That means there were two persons in the garden of eden.

Jesus Christ is the main character from the foundation of the world. We are part of him, because our souls have no time to start and no time to end. 

The first Adam needs the second Adam. The first Eve fell but the second Eve is infallible. The second Adam and the second Eve cannot fall, for they bring perfect. Paul was the messenger of the first church age and Timothy was the pastor in that time. Paul preached some of the things and brother Branham was the manifestation of those things.

Brother Branham says to the bride when I am gone your pastor will see you through. From the resolution to the exposition, you need your pastor. You cannot walk as a loner, you need a shepherd, a guide. The only person who can lead you is your pastor. 

Between the resolute and the exposition is the place of the pastor. You cannot just walk; you need to follow someone. When brother Branham had the sword, it vanished from his hands to the heart of your pastor.  The sword is the word of God, so when the sword is in the heart of a man some men will follow.

Peter was with the lord Jesus and Paul met him by revelation, but when peter and Paul met, they realized they are talking the same language. They supported one another.

We as the bride we reflect who Christ is as the groom. The only people who can sustain our standard after the prophet is our pastors. If you are the word, no one can deceive you. If the bride is taken from the groom and the groom is the Word, then the bride must be the Word.

we couldn't I bring it this morning to the church and it will be possible amen amen so all the visitors and everybody you welcome I greet our pastor as well I know he's streaming so we are together again amen amen so this morning we are going to talk about accessing the right to the tree of life we had part one then I will go for part two today there's a scripture I did not read previously the book of of Revelation for me not to forget it even was the will of God even if it was the will of God but I will start with it today amen amen before we read let's go ahead and pray for Harvest here will pray for us let us pray gracious Eternal Heavenly Father once again this morning Lord Almighty it is a privilege for us Lord to be here father for we know every time when we come in your presence Lord it is because there's something special that you have for us Heavenly Father we never even at a time came in your presence and left disappointed we never left heavenly father not having attained that which you have given us amen God almighty this morning we have come again Lord Almighty when we left our places we prayed and asked you to come come and speak to our hearts heavenly father not knowing which Vel we going to use yes but because Heavenly Father what we know it is that Heavenly Father every time you change a mask Heavenly Father you have been speaking to us Heavenly Father through the prophets Heavenly Father you came even the Bible says for so you have loved the world and given it your only begotten son and Heavenly Father The Same Spirit that was in Jesus yes Lord we have seen it in the prophet yes Lord Same Spirit Heavenly Father we have seen it in our pastor and heavenly father that is why even this morning we will be able to locate that it is still the same God who is hiding in our brother marar we pray for him Lord Almighty that you just come and Inspire him you just Heavenly Father come and H take control of this service Lord Almighty as we pray for the reading of your word and you bless us heavenly father so that when we leave this place each and every one of us will have a testimony that indeed the Lord has spoken to us as we commit the service into your hands knowing that Heavenly Father since your presence is already here the devil has no chance and Heavenly Father we will just sit and relax and hear you speaking to our souls we pray believing and asking all this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah the prayer of our brother has just said it all my my message this morning so God has never made a mistake we will fly together you will enjoy the message you will indulge on it you will meditate about it is the one that is taking us back home amen amen Revelation 1 verse 16 only that one verse Revelation 1: 16 amen and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged SW and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength amen amen so there's no one for it's okay you may have your seat you can read it for us God bless [Music] amen amen God bless you um the title is still the same it's the part two as we need access to the tree of life because the access was always denied for many years for more than 6,000 years the access was denied so we we need access to the tree of life and we have it today amen amen let me read what the prophet says here from the message of the seven Church ages seven Church ages he said all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person as well it can be otherwise that's the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden so we speak about the tree of life and the Tree of Life the man of God says the person it's a human being and the tree of knowledge of evil and the good was a person as well that means there were two persons in the Garden of Eden then it depends where you par if you from the Tree of Good and Evil it brings death and if we partake from the Tree of Life being a person then we have life amen so since well they part from the Tree of Good and Evil and evil death came in but the plan of God is we need to have access to the Tree of Life the one of Good and Evil and it was a process it was taking time to get back there so last time when I was here I show you kind of a pyramid how it started as an exposition then going up to the climate and then coming down until to the resolution conclusion like like when you read a book when you start you start it but not understanding but as time goes by you started to have a clear picture but when you come to an end the conclusion of the book then you start to have the understanding then for you to have the real understanding you must read it again then you will read it with understand that is why this morning I've just added the you know you can put the one I've sent this morning there's a cycle around the pyramid the cycle of Eternity seeing our Lord Jesus Christ being the character from the foundation of the world to the foundation of the world it goes around without initial Point amen and us being part of him because our souls has got no time to start has got no time to end we are Eternal beings amen amen so when you look at the Garden of Eden it's not the beginning of things it's just the beginning of creation right in the garden of here on Earth but there were millions billions yes that God was there before even Eden was so you never started the life in the Garden of Eden you started the life in God if God was eternal you are Eternal so God was just showing us how this drama he can play from back to Eternity amen amen let's read the book of uh First Corinthians chapter 15 First Corinthians chapter 15 we will read uh verse 45 until 47 from verse 45 to verse 47 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after what that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth e the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen amen so there was the first Adam that was a living soul and there was a second Adam that was the quickening spirit so the first ad need the second Adam right there in the Garden of Eden there was Eve who fell but right at the end here will be e who unfall the second aen cannot fall the second if cannot fall because these two bring Perfection amen amen that is why we needed brother to explain this things right at the you know conclusion right at the end of everything right there at the resolution he will conclude but from there on we need to go back exposition to make a complete cycle now for us to go to the you know Exposition brother is no longer there physically how are we going to reach there if we think if we think we need him amen amen you know our God is a good god he was never desperate I was reading brother bam was telling us there Paul was the first messenger and indeed he was but at the end of the Minster Ministry of Paul we we see Timothy being the pastor of the church on that day during the time of Paul when brother Bram come into sin he said to us I preached like Paul if Paul is in heaven I am Heavenly power Paul preach I never deviated from them and when we read F we realize this some of the things that Paul preached he was just preaching but brother BR became the manifestation Paul was saying I saw a man in Christ but when brother Bram come he didn't saw a man in Christ he was there God gave him an opportunity to be not to see be why Paul so when Paul saw maybe in a vision but brother Bram be literally there he is the seventh manager messenger when Paul come and say the the word of God is like a two-edged s what he is teaching is how far he can go is how God can give him when brother come he said that s is in my hand it was never in the hand of Paul God has just Vindicated to him this word of God it's like the sword to brother is not a vision it's not it's not a vision it's not a dream literally amen amen then if brother Bram like Paul the P to be the same he became the manifestation and brother Bram say you the bride when I'm gone your pastor will you through I'm going to put it this way from the resolution to the exposition you need your pastor because brother bred the whole thing and God took him you cannot just walk as a loner and brother said so you need leadership you need Shepherd you need someone who can guide you right back to the beginning the only person that can lead you there it's your pastor amen amen amen when you look from the exposition towards the climax there were brothers and sisters that lived the work of God and all their characters appointing to Christ I show it previously that when you look at the life of David Jesus Christ when you look at life of Solomon Christ when you look at Enoch you look at Abraham when you look at Isaiah when you look at the prophet one man having all those characters our Lord Jesus Christ becomes the main character Amen in the whole thing then when he he moved from the climate condescending towards the conclusion we see he incarnating himself in the apostles in the disciples in the children of God of that time to the conclusion and when brother BR come into the sea he said to the bride I give you the Merit certificate the one whom you are looking for the bright groom is here with you and he stop there your pastor is the one that will Asher you the Rapture is the part we do not want to talk about this morning you are allergic to the pastor put the ear PL because now we are in between the exposition and the resolution brother of the amen the letter kill you hold on those letters you don't know what God is manifesting today you will be lost having spoken weight because some of the things in the spoken we you yourself you omit them those that omit is the one that will take you through brother Bram spoke about the leadership and say a lamp or a sheep when it's lost it's lost it can't help amen amen I go to the very often and I was wondering but I got the answers today because here you know when you go to the there's many ships there there something that I saw if maybe we can experience but when I get to I was with the brothers coming from the baptism when we go to the Village I saw this man he's a Shepherd you know this man he dressed like Bas as they dress he and he talked to the animals the lamps were the Sheep were there then I heard him he was talking fast I couldn't hear ler I saw him turning around and going there and all the ships when I grew up ands you them you block this side come here this side not side this way until you looking saying this ships that's go to the she they follow their amen amen and just a nature of a sheep a sheep has made to follow not to be in front that means Us in we are against the nature but in they in nature because they are sheeps follow them if you are a sheep this morning you can not in being front of your Shepherd but you will follow amen I saw even their cett this other one was having this road I was observing then he was telling this kle you guys must eat here then they come and eat there then after some time he take the same road and they hit on their horns talking talking I don't know what he was saying and there after they leave and follow him amen amen I I've seen those when I was on the other side seeing what God in is doing in nature amen amen so between the Resolute and the exosite is the place of the look at the things here there at the resolution you see brother and Bri it was when brother was telling you that you go forth when you go forth having the med certificate having all the sins being exposed and revealed you follow you cannot just follow if you are here on Earth we need to follow someone if you do not follow your pastor but something is there for you to you can't go alone can I speak this morning when brother BR having the s in his and he said when he was opening it looking at it at sometimes it just vanished to where when God started something you will end with something it didn't vanish going nowhere but it in the hand of brother right into the heart of your pastor for you to follow because the sord is the word of God that's what says that s is the word of God and if the word of God in a man other men follow when they follow they become the they become the beneficiary was in another men those are the things we om me because we think when we mention the name is uplifting your man and then the next thing we don't want to uplift a man then the next thing he missed the [Applause] mar it's easy for me to talk you say hallelujah when I say Peter glory to God when I say Paul amen maybe people like myself maybe people like myself must say these things because others cannot say amen amen it's so easy to realize so much in history pray for me I'm too fast bless yes amen help me to relax a little bit amen can I start slow amen amen H it's too easy for us to talk about history but fail to see what God is doing in our amen amen because if we talk lies amongst ourselves we start to think that this guy want to make himself something here we talk about Abraham and Isaac up amen amen that's what we are doing I want to tell you talk about yourself talk nice amongst yourself know who you embrace one another you are more than a conqueror God has put something in your heart to tell the world don't be scared I don't want that thing whereby when we have departed and then you will say there was a man there was a by the name of s and if this is the time talk nice am [Applause] because if there's another generation to come they will talk about us because we'll be dead because we love to talk about the dead people but the living one you don't want to anything amen amen is what is happening this now I want to tell you this morning resolution and Exposition it's you and your pastor the one that is responsible you into the and that says the prophet testimony is a spoken with spoken brother Bram brother Bram when he talk he's pointing you because he knows we are in a journey he's pointing you somewhere always when you read the spoken read it again listen to this testimony testimony it's just exactly like Christ and the church when Christ had gone away from this Earth he shines back his power on the church which reflect his life who's reflecting Christ's life this morning no you love history maybe it's them during the time of brother BR but if you say us definitely us get the revelation of us today that's just like bride and the bride gr the whole book ofis the whole Bible types types out and is tied to Jesus Christ when you look at those characters they all go up Jesus Christ so now you start to realize that the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden was the Lord Jesus Christ he started the journey himself when Moses was talking was Christ talking David rule Israel God ruling Israel when Solomon rulle Israel was Christ ruling is character is taking up to the day Jesus Christ Jesus was born amen amen now we started to see that all the Old Testament men of God were reflecting him up there he's the main character he the amen amen then from there on he comes down and when he comes down when they were sitting at the upper room 120 of them it was him himself among them Peter and Paul didn't know each other but the day they come together they realize that they speak the same language Peter met Jesus face to face with him fishing with him everything with him he even saw him racing in the days healing the sea that was Peter but Paul was not there but the day Paul met Peter they spoke the same because Paul met Lord Jesus Christ when he was on the way to Damascus when that light him he realized that this is my la when they meet they spoke the same and they sat down and agreed when I go this way you go that way and then one of the days we meet and give feed they supported one another not support touching one amen we touch one another because we want the glory who said this who said what why is not me why is not me it's not you because God gave it to this brother or this sister to edify [Applause] the you know where I'm working we normally speak about the common goal we have what can the Visions gos of the company those things to reach them you need a cleaner you need a medical doctor to make sure all the emplo are healthy you need you need a quve you need a l surve you need the HR you need the you you understand you need a miner you need a driver to take the people where they you need all those things to achieve but tell me if you want to be a doctor an engineer a driver H will you make it God is a god of specialist specialist when you are born you had a special gift that you receive from God to edify his church but most of the people leave what God called them for start to be something that's where you miss the mar we need to support one notouch one if God says there's a Shepherd amongst you the first thing you need to do is support the shepherd can I take it f the man of God say that man even carry your soul what is a soul soul they say is something that worth more than 10,000 [Applause] 10,000 if is a God I am God because the bride and the [Music] groom no longer two amen amen fundamental Foundation of Faith Amen brother bam says even when a man chooses his life compion he usually inquire of her life and soth and what and what background and so forth we have to have something like that basis you ask her and now only thing he can take is a way that's all he can take and that's all that's all he can take from him in his words and there's no other way now I start to understand why this you know the young Brothers the courtship thing is coming from the devil because I've heard one was saying before I came married I need to know if this sister can cook how are you going to know that you are just starting trouble before you go further just stop there not script amen amen amen because you will visit apartment she can't cook you go to the next one she can't cook maybe the third one she can cook but she can't clean maybe this one there you going to end up having 20 and not know which one you better listen to your elders will give you Guidance the word of God says when you love your wife you don't check whether you can clean or cook or that one is yours that one is yours no I don't know how to put it that love her unconditionally because he loved us unconditionally until when she put too much Sal you blame the salt not the that's an unconditional love why you sold too much in my food why you are too much in my it's not my wife an unconditional love I want to tell you this morning God has sealed everything when they say something is sealed is completed to the call no additional thing there we this morning we are incomplete in him we are complete in him the working of the Holy Ghost spoken with spoken the work of the Holy Ghost and God Christ is our bridegroom and we are the bride this is the other part of the Covenant God made with his people and with Christ who took Christ up as a memorial and shed for the Holy Spirit here is his Covenant with his people amen amen Christ being the bridegroom us being the bride we reflect him who he is if people want to know who is Christ who is our husband they look to us we reflect here you know when a woman misbehave in the village we don't blame her we look atus I don't go [Music] fa amen amen five definite identification of the True Church of the Living God spoken with amen brother says now he liken it in many parables before I go there let me say this maybe the others did not understand when I say this is the time of the pastor in the church I will put it in a simplified manner in the work premises you work on a project operation we had what we call continual Improvement this weight called [Music] sustainability sustainability not necessarily that who can give me the you sustain the thing amen amen the only people that can sustain our standard after the prophet Pastor they stand behind the teach you guide you comfort you pray for you solve the problem for you sustain your standard because in life you've got the house got the down we've got the up we've got the down until even this morning for you to come to church it was a Str but the pastor will pray for his sh you see yourself waking up coming to church you don't know why someone there are people this morning that their duties is to pray children of God but other people they will fight to be behind the P pit you will be backlight because you are not in your position during the time of brother they say there was a sister who was always going to church early in the morning cleaning the tab when she was cleaning the tab it in every seat I don't know how many they were will stop and pray and say Lord God the one who's going to sit here bless him bless him hear the word of God give him his or desire the sister will continue and stop and pray when you come to church you just happy just say hallelujah Hallelujah you don't know Somebody Prayed for that don't be selfish stay in your life your line of duty where God has called you amen amen that's how God wants us I'm reading here amen he likened to many par like a husband and a wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer and the bride the bridegroom is no longer two people they are you and God let it not be a robber that we are equal with God we are equal with God he used to be with them he used to be above them today he's in us today he is us and today we are here you cannot differentiate between God and a man but remember you need to be sustained if we were not to be sustained if you were not be able to beain you can just pick your Bible pick your spoken with yourself maybe your family worship in the house and they come back after 3 months you are no longer worshippers cannot be sustained from your own home that's where the sustainability they've tried many they are no longer fellowshiping that is why we need that s that was in brother to so that he can set on the show and cut what is not needed [Music] that's why sometime that is why I'm saying it's okay if you blame me but I have to say things the way they are it's your pastor maybe the other people won't tell you but I'll tell you this morning it's your pastor who stood with the word of God and cut that 1977 issue 1977 it's your pastor who stood and cut the polygamist in the message started in malwi he started in Malawi came to zimb it came to South Africa right in Li your pastor stood and cut if they didn't tell you I found it appropriate for me to say this there were brothers and sisters that believed in sear it needed a Shepherd into pieces because it's unscriptural the children of God in Mala the children of God in Zimbabwe they marry wife as they wish we we needed that s and cut those things it is your past who stood and cut this thing of the Eternal sunship people in South Africa in the Mage belied de but we need a man who had a s the into [Applause] it is your pastor who stood behind the p and explained to you by the guardian angel from heaven what the seven still is and don't lie to us and said you knew about it you will be lying to us because brother BR PR about it you did not have the understanding until the pastor stood behind this and give you the understanding why other ministers are not preaching it don't to ask this morning amen uh that's what the Bible says your first husband that you were married to the world the W the anointed bridegroom which which for ordained you was Washed by the washing of the water the church says no that doesn't sound right does it you might find what is in the alic alic but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the weight everything the weight and the weight is the sord of the key and the sord of the key is the weight and the weight was Lord Jesus Christ in the beginning was that way and that way flesh in Jesus Christ you are part of Jesus Christ you are the weight if you are the weight no one can deceive you I'm looking at brother BR he is looking you know he was always coming from the East I mean going coming from the West looking at East this ministry when it come to a complete conclusion must be in the east because in the East that's where it started he said to you the spoken way invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ he's talking to you he said you are pure virous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God a woman that's born of the spirit of God and was in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every way stand as though you never SE at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen you know why people think we are still struggling and work they looking at the flesh when I'm talking about the perfect when I'm talking about the visous thing when I'm talking about the pure things to your soul to sinless because to begin with was sinless yes you li to somebody yesterday but perfect the being in you amen amen the man of God says when he looks at you is the blood through the blood then he saw you I said sinless someone the Bible says in the Book of Revelation that one used to accuse you before God he can't do it [Music] anymore there was a moment where God was allowing the Devil to come and you there are people in the church when you see them writing they're writing negative things only nothing positive when he go out he goes with negative things then you will iard you you were saying this negative was trying all right the second one you were saying this that Spirit was from the devil because the devil was working here writing negatives about the children of God until when he get to God he report to him away you say that man and God said well yeah yeah no everything will be fed devil but that was the dispensation God is God of dispensation amen and he goes by there was a moment where God himself took out the sword and he the sword himself he said devil you have done everything until this far from here going there I don't need your report do you know that scripture he cannot report you anymore because dispensation it's not the dispensation of the devil to report the children of God you just say I've heard until one of the people says I came to a point whereby even if you can tell me that you know the fish can climb up the tree other people they just like to start unnecessary that's what God told the devil list this oh no it's fine what I see here through the blood and the blood the theop of the person behold that time he was allowed this time God responds what he SE if you are theop you hold his face to will never listen [Music] to so you don't have to worry anymore I was telling the people that I'm not scared of death because you scared of death at the end when rapture chish are coming with the and then so why should you be scared of don't be scared you know why you don't have a right to be scared complete job has been done those that will be in the Rapture God knows the number that will go before the God knows the number why are you scared amen amen the Feast of the trumpet spoken with amen then the bride will come to be with the bridegroom and the bridegroom with the bride and then the great millennium the whole world is destroyed by the atomic power and there will be a new Heaven new live together don't be scared I normally tell the people in life just relax if you can relax and be the mechanics let God be the Dynamics done all you don't have to worry because the one that holds the fut there in you amen amen so you no longer worry about the things of the world I'm saying this our pastor is there streaming is influencing this mystery as he is staining us to the [Music] exposition amen amen is a good man this person but if you say to said let me make a coffee for your brother you really but don't talk nice about other people to that particular person this toxic kind of a amen amen amen the Masterpiece Masterpiece notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the weight I love this quote if it was the W or the bridegroom let me stud it again if the bright in the beginning was the way or the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also if is there is capital dou you notice the bride must be if the groom is the weight the bride is the weight as well because you cannot separate the bride from the group there are no longer 12 but one we are staining ourself such when you have built your company when you have built it the way you want it what you need is sustainability that's all when you started it's a project it's a development this and there the everything is in we just need to sustain that let's sustain ourself amen amen why must the bridegroom be the weight manifest made plain is because the bright and the bright groom are one she is just a smiting piece of there is the Masterpiece It Was Written when the word is written somewhere somehow needs to be manifested we are living in the manifestation of the word of God it was written as the Bible here It Was Written in the spoken word but we need to be the manifestation what the Bible was talking about is us what brother was talking is us when you find a company now being built no one can penetrate when you find a church that has been built from the foundation of the Apostle you can send the most you know evil preacher prer stand behind this never deceive [Applause] you you are no longer scared you guys you must be strong you must be together you must look out there you must you no longer saying this you just say my eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord where you look you go there no one can deceive you you know your St once you know your position in Christ no one can deceive you if they deceive you you are not in your right [Applause] amen amen you know Jesus Christ he was teaching them all the Mysteries but one of the days when they were together he look at Peter and say Peter the day you you are transformed strengthen your brethren leave it there amen he knows that day will come and that Day Has Come Peter that used to lie Peter that used to cut somebody's ear was a transformed Peter he was even given the keys of heaven amen am you can no longer deceive Peter he was transformed he even stood there and said if you you want to kill me pfy me like my Lord must turn my cross up down for the respect of [Applause] him Steven was stoned and St was a Deon in the church when they Stone him he said Lord forgive amen amen he did not worry anymore about what the flesh the world has because he saw heaven open if you can see Heaven open you no longer worry about the things of the world we worry about the things of the world because we haven't seen ourself in Christ if we see ourself in Christ everything that you see say with a naked eye they are temporal if you can see your body the one you boost about is temporal one of the days will go away belong [Music] am you do not have to to boast about what you have there was a king who boasted about what he had all what the world know the moment he want to enjoy himself was the end of amen amen so when while sustaining ourselves let's go up there my last quote from the church age [Music] book the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is where he leads me the people do not want to be followers but they want to be followed the devil did not want to follow go to follow God but he's got many followers she will never let by she will never be left by him okay she will never leave his sight she will share the throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and honor I'm sorry the business people normally they do this thing of out of property in out of their bus sake but here in the word of God I'm not saying about you but here in the word of God meaning Christ in the church and the bride only one thing in community of prop ours who we are is his we share the throne with amen amen so the only access that we need to enter in the Garden of Eden where the sword is Flaming is blocking the way to is when you stay with your pastor he will teach you amen he will guide you he will embrace you he doesn't have jealous if you want a business he will pray for you to get that business get that job and when you get it you can back slide doesn't matter but his duty was to make sure you what is true for you a specialist the one who stood among the Israelites amen amen and then he was just praying for them you know we Sim you are there you you are there you know you Judah you are there amen but he was just ushering the blessing today a specialist job and I like it when today we will say you are a Christian if you haven't reached that spot you still in a journey but the day we say you are a real Christian is when you live yourself and live for others that's what say you live to others because your duty as a Christian is to do nothing but to impact life you are a Living Sacrifice you show the world who you are is live for others amen amen if you don't want to give someone 10 when he needs can I tell you something that 10 disappear because you supposed to to help somebody then you I will be looking for that was showing you help others because I helped you God bless you amen amen as we stand to our feet and sing unto the Lord amen amen this a song nice [Music] [Music] [Music] God God God [Music] [Music] see God God [Music] God oh see [Music] [Music] amen amen may the Lord richly bless you and may the Lord richly bless our elders we are going to invite dad to say a word of prayer God bless you amen [Music] I still remember one day when we were talking to the Pastor said there's the angel of the Lord in the Pulpit amen many people didn't understand that [Music] so has G us a light so that we can see there's no man can speak like this with without the angel of the Lord take the control there's Authority there is power we thank the message Father God because it shows what it comes from the Hallelujah dear Lord we have prayed said we are going to the sav please speak to us one day I still remember the Pastor said some people they can ask something to God when God bring that thing and they get surprise because they don't know what they are asking so dear Lord this is what we've been asking speak to us and you did speak to us and you just told us who is the pastor amongst us amen father God I still remember the story of a rich man and a poor man yes the rich man saw Abraham and saw Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham and said Father Abraham send Lazarus to us and dear Lord when we look at that scripture according to the scripture was supposed to be God or it were supposed to be Jesus J but that rich man didn't see God didn't see Jesus he saw Abraham the man who was on the earth

not it will stays like that because you speak through men father God to give us a pastor to Pastor Us in this Pulpit father God this is the fruit that come from his ministry this is what the pastor
