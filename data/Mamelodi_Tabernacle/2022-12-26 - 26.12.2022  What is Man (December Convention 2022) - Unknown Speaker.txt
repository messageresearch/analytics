The primary purpose of this sermon is to inform our viewers and community about what is  Man and the text of ,  showing the Church that when you look at Jesus you will either see a Man or see Christ. During the service the Pastor read Hebrews‬ ‭2‬:‭2‬-‭6‬ ‭ “For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?

I couldn’t tell It, just what It—just what It said, but I know that It was them Seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together, just banging seven different times. And It unfolded into something else that I seen. Then, when I seen That, I looked for the interpretation. It flew across there, and I couldn’t make It out. That’s exactly right. See?

yeah we will go see at the end now let's tend to a scripture here the man of God has just prayed for the blessing foreign [Music] amen amen then the Seven Seals page five six seven in my book paragraph one okay five six seven one okay let's have it brother I think is it from the same is it from the same Bible we requested yes okay amen Hebrews chapter two verse six to nine part one in a certain place Justified saying what is meant that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitors him Thou made as him a little lower than the Angels thou countest him with glory and on and did set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God shall taste death for every man amen [Music] what is that you consider so much we're talking with their brothers this morning this morning yeah because it says but we see Jesus Jesus Jesus Jason is God came to him who took the form of men amen for men is so important that's why he says either you see this the man or you see Jesus I mean I mean and now I read I'm going to read the our series book book we have page five six seven five six seven and uh before we start I hope I I have that book with me I've got some several books here sorry Pokemon uh is that five six seven seven five six seven okay bear with me and uh will come there I have yeah five six seven letter gonna five six seven what's this great secrets that lays beneath this seal Cecilia that's why Heaven remained quiet too with we looked at it even yesterday how the Angels come over stop when it was revealed so great that the Angels stop says why they stopped I think we have seen it yesterday where we're dealing with the seventh seal we are really available and the third pool three I mean the seventh seal and they're three-fold Revelations the threefold Revelation let me read it Christ amen yeah she page 60. we are going back to that Jesus said yes then he says that's this day amen okay amen that's this no yes amen at that day does she live but she says that's this day he said so um that is that's this day amen when this Revelation is made known it does being a revelation but not made known but when it is made known Jesus spoke of it at that day another thing he says you shall know amen I I have checked through to see whether I know because if it is this day then there's something I know amen and there is something you know amen but it's coming through this threefold manifestation you shall know at that day that I am in foreign amen God being part men be being part of that threefold that's why we realize here that when the seal is revealed amen amen only the threefold okay fell out all threefolded it is this revelation comes through the three-fold amen now what what is this threefold not threefold we'll see what is this three-fold one or threefold amen amen that's how God operates on coming from all the way before Genesis [Music] Cod the first God is a spirit then it says the logos logos then it says out of the logos so that is the threefold the father 30 and then uh what follows amen foreign [Music] and that makes but it is in a three-fold now when the seals were opened up uh even the sixth year when it was opened let me just read something quickly okay I mean God bless you God bless you all right amen the mystery of these seven series firstly I will start here he omitted the revelation of the seventh seal will at least amen when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it reality again so we see that it's in a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for this mystery to be known all right amen it was he omitted it holy treat because the hour now was not yet for the mystery to be known therefore we are this far and the rest of it will be known now are you listening carefully will be known it will see right around about the time that Jesus appears on the air okay amen again for the his bride or what whatever uh take its place at that time amen amen uh you know we we once spoke about this where the Prophet says it is not revealed to the public but he said let us he said as far as we can go right there and now I trust that each and every one of you and do that which is right uh all with all your life your your life and save him and God will take care of the rest amen amen amen amen you know we I didn't need to pray for the revelation of the Southern seals because he has already told me that it is it will be it was revealed amen but to the rest not revealed now you know something can be revealed to somebody amen amen and but to be known to the others to be made known to the others foreign [Music] for you it will be you made it it will be not revealed but made known it was revealed to this man Prophet leave it alone and he also said I must stop here because it was not yet revealed to the public but yet it was revealed but it will be made known to be made known is to know what was revealed amen amen now others were not waiting for the for it to be revealed because it was already revealed the public has not made known to the public firstly today and he kept quiet knowing that God will do the rest amen amen so we are looking at this even The Sixth Seal really here now we find that the sixth sale has been opened Liberty to us we see it and we know that that's about what this is this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public is amen okay I mean that is that great seal okay and you know what how how was it revealed I I I I'm looking at this we we want Moses and Elijah here 's vision do I have the book here yes amen in this part mode vision page 118.118 you know it yeah I see it says here I started some stand yeah shall not pass away foreign [Music] they were found by the Sea yeah all right amen now he took them you know the first thing when he met them fishing he said to them cast deeper and we realized that after that he also took them up to their highest mountain they could go deeper and they could go higher these three Witnesses amen amen the mission to go deeper was given to these three foreign Audi so surely they he equipped them now here it says notice before Jesus now now there appeared unto him Moses and Elijah these are the message just to the Jews today because we have three fold here then he says when it was open also it's under this threefold look how fast now we read here uh Moses it was Moses Elijah and Jesus on top of they were talking about Jerusalem what was the topic brother it is Luke chapter 9 verse 28 more Luca nine verse 28 and it came to pass about an eight days after this saint he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray and as he played the fashion of his countenance was altered and his Remnant was white and glistering and behold they talked with him two men which were Moses and Alliance who appeared in glory and spake of his disease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem amen amen the three were already talking about their mission to Jerusalem and you know in Jerusalem there came Moses and the the the spirit of Elijah from the Gentiles the Gentiles who was now in a dream he says it was a joke even with that Elijah only the spirit from off the gentleness that is the same Spirit then it was in John the Baptist it is going now to this man he says it will be a joke for to introduce Jesus the Messiah through the Jews now that's why when they were standing here on the mountains they were discussing that yeah have men what they were it was all topic about Jerusalem because they will appear there well before the tribulation periods God will visit his people the Jews and you know how we went through it yeah they will go through the 144 000. we'll go through the tribulation period amen amen but then they've got their place after that let's look at this and it says now there appeared unto him Moses and Elijah what form is the son of man coming in now first we will appear Moses that will be his coming then we have read that that the end time ministry uh was Moses we have seen Moses Elijah and brother brand names I'm a minister Ministry I don't have the book now you know we have read it several times amen amen and that in this ministry of Elijah there will be the ministry of Moses and the ministry of Elijah in this ministry reading of Elijah brother Branham how many remember that it is in the books one of them is the rapture now there was three full peoples of the six seals the people should be three-fold and the people but who will uh whom the peoples it would be received a free food it makes you part of that threefold when it is revealed it is revealed in a threefold purpose [Music] to whom is revealed in the free food [Music] because this mystery is not just to the people what is to the threefolds and me amen amen now if you are part of the threefolds all right let me check here a bit Yeah God bless you God bless you yeah it's wonderful to hear this thing he says five seven five feet in this book I don't know in another version do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal is also in a three-fold man a mystery right it is opened it would but in a three-fold those who will see it or receive it those that are part of the threefolds it's coming to the threefold threefold was the father that day you shall know that you are part of the three four you shall know that I am in my father let me let me let me check it for you again at that day use you and another great thing here it says Siri at that day you shall literal no because fever do you know something amen okay I mean there's something here Hey Brother one issue that's why it's only for the threefolds that's all fair amen the receiver of this mystery is the one that's part of the threefold someone it is [Music] do you know something amen amen let me finish it at that day ended that is this cute actually you know that after it is it is it was opened camera Russian because the first thing it was opened and secondly it was reversed yeah foreign now Jesus said at that day then he says that is this day when this Revelation is made known it's division you will know go see you you will see now do you know now what you will know that now what I am in the father and the father in me and you and Lewin in me oh come on whatsoever is revealed it's only known to this three-fold King 348 that is the mystery of God the mystery Tupa the unfolding who put all of that mystery is for the mystery amen listen intelligent you you for you to receive this he made you a mystery amen I mean are you listening to this amen amen it must be a mystery to a mystery I mean I'm age 69.69 area Christ is how God revealed himself and raise it up by the word okay let me start here he is the first fruit of the Resurrection and he says the congregation say Amen congregation he is the head of the body you'll see the good head here and and which is his church what a bright body must follow the head we are the middle so it is part of his resurrection of his resurrection when he resurrected we don't only learn or we are not only receiving the gospel about the resurrection we are part of it when you are talking about reason [Music] you are everything he is [Music] [Music] [Music] all right hallelujah hallelujah yeah listen yeah he is the age he cannot solve the body yeah me which is his Church the bride now then the brains body must follow the heads why so it is you know is that three-fold it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery how God come from revealed himself here and raise it by the way so he Reveals His Church you know there is a church and there's a church that is revealed then when it is revealed it is called the bride if it is not revealed it remains as a change that's the difference [Music] it's part of his threefold Mysteries [Music] if it is revealed I mean it is only known by these threefold mystery you are dead the brightest part of that is Us in him you shall know that day [Music] threefold Mysteries you should know that you are part of the three foods when a seal is revealed amen amen it is any other person to a change as I said that the next thing that will follow or we will appear will be done it will he said it will be here at the church and then people thought that but when I was talking about Brandon the bright is amen amen somebody but the mystery is on the day of the Rapture he says amen amen you know we have another the brethren in the sixth dimensions you doubt it now I thought out of him our Brethren there's six Dimension dimensionable tillage part of us [Applause] every Church age group that was set aside who's going to rule foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] this Ministry is made of veterans [Applause] you will only win because you have one who finished but who will win the people who have who have won give us NJ amen that battle was all in heaven it came down to the Earth and those who have won I still winning even now amen and are still going to win these are the veterans I know his tricks will do nothing Saturday [Applause] [Applause] God will bring the same people to the same Souls [Music] and I had a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them just then you know brother harvested told us Rejoice he was talking to to those who are there already after the Rapture amen because that was the start of the tribulation Rejoice ye in heaven the raptured says he said Rejoice he accused them day and night yeah [Music] then he says now Rejoice of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he has but a short time divine the first Earth the fussy and the Sea little water who are these Inhibitors of the sea Cube the Earth ly amen amen who who are they all right leave it there let's let's look at this now rejoice you the raptured sins of the earth those who have missed the rapture Satan Satan is cast down when the bride goes up foreign foreign that's why they say run for your life amen that time arrives one day they will be the last announcement and that man who will sit saying I am God let me not say we I have seen him already preparing for that we will say that man is there already preparing for to rule he has even changed the Ten Commandments soon have you seen it you know the bride has a watchful eye we are looking at these things we see we have seen that man even changing the Ten Commandments because they have said openly Jesus has failed that's why the world is going this way there are those that are in their constellation you know even the message it's a true message is said by those that are in the constellations before God could speak to brother Branham the first thing you will put him in a constellation you know that there's so many constellations today one is called a way which are there's this one called let me get you the name you know if you want to be seen and to be admired you get into a constellation Instagram Instagram oh there's many of them but if you want to be seen of the world that's why I said one time never never try to put me in that Instagram talking about Instagram I don't belong there I said no the constellation is this threefold okay threefold mystery of God I'm already occupied I don't want to be seen of men I want to be seen of the one who has seen me before the foundation coming to change his brother Brennan says amen I only want to be seen the one who created me when he created you there was one thing in his mind but the man should be like him that was the right constellation man God wanted men to be like him amen amen and now John we have this many here who wants to be like God I'll tell you brother Branham says God's Prophet I love the prophet of God that's why I read his books here he said in the book you know that the sons of God will be Gods amen have you read that amen let me repeat it but he says about the sons of God will be God amen though some don't do it no problem then in the book adoption yeah adoption he speaks of my inheritance and your inheritance if you will accept it as inheritance he says or your inheritance is amen amen then going down okay what did he saying your godship and then down the line he says now the sons of God will you be manifested and they will take from Satan but culture he made you a son but Satan when he murdered the plan of God God could not be defeated amen there's a law of restoration that's why there was a gap left there and when he was coming Adam I don't God not meaning that God did not see him but I don't see you in your position I don't see you in your post because that's like a mirror to God um I mean I mean now for all these ages and so forth the struggle Katana is to bring Adam back you wish each other or eternity will run again [Music] when Adam is what is happening now when Adam is amen amen what was it foreign Haiti when he spoke of the squirrels a place where there's no squirrels and talking about sister [Music] foreign blood [Music] amen amen amen among all those days um did you hear that sister she didn't say that from me amen very meaningless Peter Petro who do men say that I the son of man [Music] yeah and the same applied to Peter limo Petro Pedro you didn't see it from here I mean I mean my father you are blessed because my father daddy chose you oh Haiti and my father Tate spoke through you know the answer came from God amen amen that's right the message came from the father um is that right now which one before we close here listening how God revealed himself here [Music] he Reveals His church have you never have you ever heard of the revealed Church that's why when it is revealed it is called the bride now I mean not just a change I think like a friend that one you can't start as the people can come together and say okay let's start our movement yeah we will be our pastor no this one is the revealed [Music] his body it's his body he was revealed amen amen the members are part of the threefolds in this body amen have we started a church no no one has the blood to stop yourself some people sometimes they end up in the court of law saying I started amen amen you if you say you start the church do you have that blood now because it takes the blood of God to start a church it is a change but it's human change the next time they break again out of that human change that's why it's the place is littered with churches hail among virgins then the prophet of God tells me I love this Prophet you know it was the word that came to Mary and Mary said I am just a before this was born this one was born Joseph Joseph was set aside it should not be the blood of Jesus it should be the blood of God now Joseph was set aside the wake of the Lord was done let me repeat to you who didn't foreign then the prophet of God says You must listen to the prophet always I mean I mean that's why the people who do not listen to the prophets they start what they call message churches I don't know of any messages then you visit these messages that might differ a woman I met at me the place of my brother-in-laws this one is and she says I also used to accompany my pasta everywhere and the next thing there was a rumor about him foreign I said okay okay the problem here is you say you followed the pastor now the Bible says we believe the Lord said Murano really come unto me that is the Lord Jesus Christ you remember he said talking to this woman I will build my church and it takes his blood what's your body around do that and the gates over here shall never Prevail because I said do you know of this one you know of the pastor amen amen and you drop off the light but there is this one of of the master the Lord I will build my church and the gates of Hades never because where is that church it's called The Bride today [Music] gbr It Is by I think it's x-20 yeah but of the blood of God Amen the ministry if you have received this ministry this word of God it is the blood of God Amen when it as the prophet says when he receives she received that weight by Gabriel then that word by Gabriel he realized in her womb I mean a son was born amen godimu gave birth to him his own son it was God is amen but now I I'm finishing here now everything is going back now amen amen as everything is going back while I'm around God under the law of restoration uh he showed to me when he brought brother Branham then I could see that one hour with brother Brennan Brothers did you know why the sword was given to brother Brandon Brothers because restoration if it was in the end like Adam he forfeited the book that's why after the battle camera the Lord Jesus has won the battle offended and became wealthy yeah it was not in the library it was not just a book a very simple fan to be opened by any person oh there was a battle in the Lord fought when he was crucified he was not in danger amen amen amen because the Lord Jesus Christi he didn't fear what men could do it's it's himself who has planned that crucifixion [Music] he has chosen the way of the Cross himself he came to the cross that was his Plan of Redemption is that right now which one amen amen he was the master that's why he said father forgive them they don't know what they do I have planned it to be this way amen amen for to save my people tomorrow you know that song amen amen when they came to get some money where is Timothy he could have called Ten Thousand Angels amen amen amen but she died alone amen amen he said don't you know I can call Angels here but because the scripture must be fulfilled take me so as for to fulfill the scriptures [Music] he didn't need a lawyer or a lawyer it was his own act eventually to be here this afternoon amen amen amen his weed in you is The Blood come back amen amen the blood that became the way that became blood in Mary and that word came to me and you know his blood materialized and became weird yeah that's why it is impossible it is impossible [Music] amen amen amen for what he has made us to be I was telling the brothers about the brother who's going around talking about him saying some of the people saying is a wizard and I said there's a brother he phoned me don't you hear that brother talking about you everywhere he is talking about you I said yeah and they said why you are quiet I said no he's not talking with me is not talking to me is talking to some other people so I don't need to answer you all right he is at Liberty to talk they talked about Jesus that he is the king of the Demons we don't hear the Lord saying I will take you to God like us you'll be arrested for talking about my name he came to save me so he kept quiet amen amen you know some other people but some don't even are no longer coming to the service because government he or she says somebody said some bad things concerning him or about him can that stop you from being a child of God part of the threefolds threefold I think they couldn't make it because I asked them to put this maybe I haven't received any weight since ever amen whoa what's the pointer here so that we can finish yes but the the point that should point then anyhow amen let me finish this part how God revealed himself here and raise it up by the way he reveals the church and raising it up by the same weight I threw in July now you are each part of his threefold Mysteries the church who tell the bride is threefold amen now if there is a mystery that is revealed it will only reflect [Music] [Music] in order to receive a mystery amen Only a mystery I'm into a mysterious I mean that's why now it becomes a Seven Seals and then is the third the threefold okay Amen Let us finish here all right did you hear me can I go he reveals this church well if he Reveals His change you know members in that body are the revealed people it is made of the revealed Souls they build people the church which is now called The Bride yes is the only a threefold Ministry that can receive mysteries from God keep foreign [Music] see don't you know brother no I mean I would say we wanted you I mean God and men do you move the mood it's golden man that's this manifestation this book takes it all I've been reading it since I'm going back I read this yeah let me look there yeah um okay okay okay right amen what is the secret s now I'm coming here we put it there so that you can take them down foreign [Music] 30. I you you you'll get the right seal book because versions are different individuals send it down I remember see this is one of the things that is page five five six paragraph four to eight I mean uh the breaking of this cell that heaven was foreign true be put back today post I would say 10 men and and God become one and Eternity continues uh as certain as I stand in the platform there is your sins I heard the Revelation that's revealed okay [Music] it's in a three-fold manner so the the people who will hear it but are part of the threefold threefolds three folding and that day we shall know that I am in my father yeah and me you in me threefold Mysteries I and you are part of it now when it is [Music] it is not to the world I sell the operation is Operation is a revelation coming down yeah we get threefolds yeah four three four is somebody there [Music] okay and that's why it's not made known to everybody you belong to the three foreign amen amen amen hey now I will lose you with a happy heart heavily is it the next where's the next one yeah the next page Christ is the mystery of God no Christ The Mystery of God revealed revealed yeah the threefold mystery of God so you are part of that oh mystery amen Christ is the mystery of God foreign uh it is here that is Page page 21 page 31.21. amen is that my time brother is this my time my today's day okay okay no problem where is he paragraph one three nine yeah no page 21 plus page 21 21 oh yeah yeah why why I'm remaining here also it says now in revealing the uh in revealing the mystery of God he was God's threefold peoples for the church right I mean you must keep the threefold because when the Revelation is revealed it will only reflect therefore okay amen now because Calvin remember that you ask a person why you say it was not revealed where the Prophet says let me remind you of something here it was not revealed you see but it was opened it was but not revealed to the public it was revealed to the messenger not to the public because he said just remain worshiping God do all that is right and God would you just carry on right on and God him will take care of their rest yeah that's why people were confused when it said even the angels because now when the sun comes in when the substitute leaves they substitute people then it is time for the sun to come in because the sun the sun was no Jesus the sun was Adam Luke chapter 3 tells you which was the Sun God was the god of the of the universe but Adam was the god of God the earthing of the earth oh my it is in your spoken word I mean all right I mean he was God it says he was irrebelling God Amen the headquarters of Adam was the Garden of him headquarters of God now it was hidden the headquarters of God and foreign God he said that's as far as we go I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do which is that which is right and love him all your life life and God will take care of the arrests amen but you should follow it he omitted the the revelation of the seventh seals and yeah when the seventh seal when you open it he also omitted each other see so we see that it is in a complete mystery the hour is not yet for this mystery to be known and the rest of it will be no because if I repeat right around about the time what is happening now amen amen I'm closing by saying I have now received what God has promised here amen I won't talk about your own spiritual experience I have seen it I have received said to be the rest of it now I've seen it the rest of it and he says the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears for his bride before he can take his pride of mysteries he has to bring their branches what to pay now because the price is part of his threefold Mysteries is the mystery of God in a three-fold I'm not struggling to be ruptured I'm just part of the threefolds we don't pray to for to be rapture we are already in it amen amen we went we are in the constellation already that's why we can't come I can't come here to talk about the other people and the other things I don't have time for that I'm here to talk about him amen amen I think we have finished it all right Jordan which one is the last one brother can you guide me yeah paragraph 139.139 to 156.
