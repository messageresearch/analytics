number 25 to 26 John 11 verse 25- 26 it reads as foros Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this hallelujah amen because we've got Pastors in in our we'll just ask just to lead us in prayer amen amen we thank you for this Gathering to come and accompany our late mothers we approach your throne in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for your goodness your mercy and life thank you for guidance and Leadership of the Holy Spirit we pray father we invite you in this meeting we realize that you you were here already before we even came may you provide the word now Lord the spiritual food we pray father to the strength especially of the family Lord to lift their Spirits Lord Jesus and help those who don't know you to come nearer to you that they may be in your your presence in the last day I pray father I commit Lord all things into your hands as we bow our heads humbly before you knowing that lord it's so important that your word should find its place in our heart bless your word as it shall be it has been read and bless it to the strength of our bodies in Jesus Christ's name Thanksgiving we pray amen amen we may be seated hallelujah amen yesterday I was so much blessed when the pastor was preaching here he said the family of Lazarus they had the body with them but Jesus he came having Lazarus with him hallelujah amen in other words this body there's nothing that can happen to it beside that Heavens are you here if it wasn't Heavens that meet with this body they were they had the body they were crying but when Jesus came are you here and they stopped crying their tears were wiped away because the master he had arrived hallelujah amen many are saying Jesus was too much too late because they needed Jesus while Lazarus was still sick but he never came during that time because he knew them that this sickness is not unto death but it is a [Music] sickness that is going to bring glory to God hallelujah amen when he came he came having their hope hallelujah amen now this morning in my heart there is this words that we have already read the Bible is saying Jesus said unto in other words when Jesus came he found Mara was complaining that had you been here our brother father would have been alive hallelujah amen but then when Jesus arrived he said to Mara I am the resurrection and the life hallelujah amen I am the resurrection and life he that believe in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whatever leaveth and believeth in me shall never die now Jesus is asking Mara believe thou this when responded she said she said unto him yeah Lord I believe that Thou Art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world in my heart there's this thing that God has placed that are you believing believe as that that Jesus is saying because everything it is based on whether Jesus is finding a place in the human heart our mother has traveled her journey she has completed her journey the ministry that was in here or the faith has made her that today that even when we are crying but we cry but having an understanding that wherever she is she is in Everlasting Joy hallelujah amen he said the pastor yesterday that she is now in the sixth Dimension hallelujah amen where we are not growing up where we are in the same same age where we remain Young he said in heaven we will have a youth service amen there is no service for the elderly even Jesus his ministry it was a Ministry which arrived at the age where he was3 at the age of 33 years he couldn't go past that age wait so that we can reach our home hallelujah amen but the Bible is saying do you believe that because everything is based on whether you believe hallelujah amen he says when he speak here M verse 24 Jesus is saying Jesus said unto her brother shall rise again said I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last had the knowledge his brother shall resurrect during the day of Resurrection but now Jesus is saying I love Jesus wasn't wrong but she didn't have the Revelation that for Jesus to be present yes there is a resurrection yes Hallelujah but there is a resurrection also she was talking about the resurrection he was talking about the current resurrection of Lazarus amen Jesus said I am the resurrection hallelujah amen I am the life do you believe that hallelujah amen I know there is a but now the one standing in front of you he is the resurrection am now what God is saying here that we need to believe that during this time there are things that God wants to raise in the lives of the children children of God Amen but what is important many people live their lives but Jesus is saying I am the resurrection and life in other words there is your life and there is the life of God amen now in your life life sometime get mixed up and end up deciding to take your own life because there is no direction in your life it is because it is yours if you have your own life if your life the owner of the life is not present then your life will be messed up but now Jesus is saying to today your brother shall resurrect in other words today Jesus can change things today Jesus can turn the cry because he arrived as the resurrection and he is the life but so that that can happen he's not only coming to you but now he comes to you also with his nature because our nature it must end so that his nature can because his nature he has eternal life the time that we are living we are living in a time where we know that there a day in the last day all those who are asleep all those who are in the sixth Dimension amen they will come together with him and we all of us will change and then we can meet him but for that to happen it it needs you not to remain so that you don't Remain the the question says do you believe that amen amen believest thou that hallelujah amen [Music] he that believeth in me though he were [Music] dead there's no one who doesn't love to live we have people today they are in hospitals what they are fighting for they are fighting to live amen but the god that we worship he takes where the doctors has said they are failed where the doctors are now surrendering saying there's nothing we can do in actually I have a testimony of our sisters who we worship with that the husband where the doctor said we can't do anything just go prepare but the sister said where the doctor's knowledge ended there is a God he's taking right from there hallelujah amen impossible and brings the impossible and make it to be and take from where there was death and bring life R now I want to say today [Music] only all things are possible if you believe the pastor has spoken enough yday amen he spoke about the mother and about us but now today I want to focus on us because the mother has walked her journey now me and you we are here and now that we have remained the question says where are we going to spend our eternity the time that we in we are in a time where we are at the end of everything hallelujah amen we are at the end of everything this world we are in it has arrived where it is ending and the Bible is saying if you want to know that he says look at all the signs hallelujah amen the signs are saying that the time we are in is the time where everything is ending but for that to happen let it happen while your life it is also in Christ the word of God is saying before the end of the world there will be the drying of the river Euphrates we have seen that has happened today you can even check Google and see the Bible is saying there will be the shaking of the world the earthquakes we see there are flats we see there are fires all these things they are saying there's somewhere where we are going they are happening right before our eyes but I'm going to say and don't just believe don't believe that I'm in the church don't believe that I have the pastor but believe unto Jesus himself because if you have met him amen everything will be right amen the God has given us pastors and the pastors are preaching amen but the pastors who are preaching the word of God is saying those are the ones who are coming from him and God has given but you what you must do you must meet him meet Christ you must meet God and when you have met him amen he is the one who's going to your life amen hallelujah amen and believeth in me shall never die hallelujah amen he that believe believing unto God die he will never die hallelujah amen what does that mean he will never die words the more we are alive here on Earth having God in our midst then that means we have passed death and we have entered into life even if there can be death but the word of God says as long if as long as you are in him that death doesn't have power over your life because you have life that is eternal life that came how by you believing amen believing into Christ Jesus amen there are words here in Romans chter 14 verse 8 verse 8 Romans chapter 14:8 for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords amen for we [Music] live we live am we live for him we must live for him because when we live his word is in us when we say believe you believe the word because the word it it is him sometimes I I let God be gracious to us he he has been gracious to us when we were still growing up not believing while we are still attending school let me talk about me for a while I was still young at school and and there was this lady I left but I wasn't saved I was still a boy then I wrote a letter when I wrote the letter I'm saying the letter I'll give you [Music] money I build a house for you amen I was at school that time in fact it was a higher Primary School it was a higher Primary School amen amen now that that letter I forgot it in the pocket when I forgot [Music] it and then my mother was made doing washing when she's doing washing she's searching the pockets the mothers are searching the pockets before they do the Wasing [Music] amen those who are trust withy when they find money they bring it amen when my mother found the letter she reads the letter she said yeah that's why money is just going here in the house we have a man here who's supporting a wife somewhere amen and I was doing this not understanding what I was doing amen when I arrived from school my mother said do you know this letter when I saw the letter was amen amen then that I was caught amen okay my mother has already passed she passed when she was 99 when she found the letter she said to me your father tonight he will be with you then I realized I'm in trouble but what I'm trying to say is this that God has given us a letter I regard as our love letter from the Lord I'm regarding this book as the love letter from the Lord amen because God has brought this word because he has love to us he doesn't even wish for one to be lost he doesn't even wish for one because where we are going we will talk the other day but what is important it it is to make right your life with God while time still permit then that will put you in a position that your life it is now led by him now he is able to speak to you because in the time that we in amen we are living in a time where God when you receive him to be in you he comes in you now there are certain spirits which are controlling because now maybe you haven't understood you haven't agreed doesn't allow any vacuum they nor say in other words in other words there is no space or any place where there is no or nature doesn't allow any vacuum amen amen trying to say that in the life of a person if Christ is not there amen if Christ is not there there is something that and that which is there it is fighting with Christ amen now and that which is taking the place it is making that even though you wish that you should have a life that is straightforward but that which is present it is fighting against your wish amen that is at some point you'll find people even try to take their lives has shut down because they realiz if if he has entered through you accepting then that means the higher power is taking place and the Lesser power has to vacate the place [Music] amen because if he has taken place he is the almighty God he is he has made us also to be Al because we come from and we are returning to himen now it is important that when he is if there's something that is happening he will you lead sometimes you hear people saying there's something that is telling me to do this but you you find that is a wrong thing but this time but this time now when it is him all those things that were resting resting because of the condition because of the wrong Spirit when he arrives amre then the resurrection takes place because now he is in you he is now resurrecting things amen things which were not going the right way there is the word of God that is saying but seek therefore it says seek therefore seek first the kingdom of God and righte in other words the first thing that you must seek for you must seek God first am when God comes with hise he comes he comes with his nature amen this body that we are in this body it is taking the nature of but there is another body which is in this body that body in other words this body that we have put on it it needs its things it has its own nature it wants to do things of the amen why it is against that other body because that body inside it has the nature of God it wants to do the things of God but then there's a conflict when there is that conflict our God is always a victim overcome hallelujah amen then you are of righteousness then you are called to be of righteousness because you have seek God and you found him now seek the kingdom of God shall be add we need things because as we are here we need things but then we don't have them because even when we ask we ask wrong but now when we come to himed his nature having received his word allowing him to lead us to build our houses there's nothing nice in the home i' like to say when you are going out to church going out out all of you as a family amen but for that to happen let it not be Let It Be Your need amen that Lord when I'm being helped let also my family be helped amen let this gospel be added also to the rest of my family hallelujah amen that prayer that was offered by the wish that was said by sister I want everyone to believe my children to you also when you believe accept him that he must be Resurrection in that he should give you life then he's able to listen that what else do you need if you need the rest of your family hallelujah

also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple hallelujah amen now prophet Isaiah the prophet Isaiah here he's talking about another man called hallelujah amen it's like this it's like this he in the that in the year that died I also saw the Lord he had closed there was somebody who wanted to see God but he [Music] couldn't because OA had blocked now there are many OAS who had blocked amen so that we couldn't see God but the Bible is saying in the year we'll talk the other day about this now in the that died the Bible is saying Isaiah is saying I saw

is no hunger amen God he will descend he will descend amen from heaven from his seventh Dimension am and pick those hallelujah amen when he picks those coming with them we who are here on Earth the Bible is saying very quickly of our bodies be changed amen when they are changed what are they doing they are putting on the word body that body that which is embodied by this is it is the Throne of God is where God humbles us where God is humbling us where God is discipl when we change then we meet together with we will meet him he will be standing in the sky and we we will change very quickly

it's not hallelujah amen it is not easy in this world we are in things are happening in this world are getting so expensive is getting expensive there's nothing that is nice in this but we are hoping for that when we arrive amen because inheritance there's an inheritance there's an inheritance that God has reserved for us as the sons and the daughters amen that inheritance there's not even one sack that can arrive there and steal our inherit because that inhance it is our it is your inheritance amen amen don't cry anymore just believe just receive so he can be the Lord if you have a question just hold me by the jacket and direct me what should I do what I will do I'm not going to call chch but I'll call you to him so that you can meet him when you have met him he will lead [Music] you he has led me also he can also Lead You amen and now when he's leading all of us there wouldn't be any conflicts among us there wouldn't be any hate among us because he is love when he is love we will be we will have life there wouldn't be any gossips but there will be sympathy on to another amen if you have come with your problem I'll be able to listen amen when it needs prayer then I'll go on my knees pray for you to the higher office then now when that needs me to lead you to the higher office to the higher office then I will take it to the higher office just for your own for your own sake amen there's no more time everything has closed hallelujah amen the pastor is saying the seven seal it closes everything we'll talk about it one day that is closing everything God is [Music] ready to come and take his bride hallelujah amen because he's our husband and now we are the bright when we are the bright don't do something which is wrong to the bride they say even when the husband in the family even if he's afraid he's timid but just touch the wife you realize he's not timid amen if you can touch the the wife of Christ you are just touching that eye of Christ but what you can do is what you can do is to come and be part that when we are going hu amen then we go together with you going to pray amen as we are praying I like that you can sing one song that we can sing

in your image you made us so beautiful father that the devil is so jealous but father we have defeated him yes Lord Paul therefore asked a question death where is your Victory yes amen truly even the message this morning has brought us to a level of Resurrection yes Lord we believe father that we have the power of Resurrection yes Lord Death has not right over our lives Lord we have believed your word and we walk with you and father we have started because potentially father we are raptured yes Lord amen we can see the signs of the time father Lord that there is nothing good in this world everything is failing things are falling apart and therefore father but your word has promised that you are the same yesterday today and forever yes Lord therefore we are so thankful that you have spoken unto us we are so thankful that father our mother you have kept her in your bosom Yes Lord she is in a better place and she's looking upon us and saying you have the right path yes Lord so therefore father as you have spoken unto us we say thank you and as we about to depart to put the body of our mother we say be with us on another side and father we thank everyone that came to support the moanes and to strengthen them and we know that your word will never fail they are strong they can see that father we are passer by in this world and therefore father we commit everything unto your hands as you have spoken to us believing in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] hallelujah amen amen we are thankful sints at this time where we [Music] are at this time [Music] we'll just give our brother uh maybe we'll give an announcement so we can get a direction how we going to go from and then after [Music] that and we'll ask those who are coming to help us here while the rest of us are going [Music] out uh there's just one announcement here okay earlier on they've made an announcement that from here we going to Waterfall symmetry in midrand and then after the session at the Symmetry we all coming here to have something to drink and the pastors will be the ones who are following the family car and the rest of us will be coming after the pastor's come and then there is a transport to the grave site for those who need transport there are three uh EV buses outside so even those who might need to leave their Cas here use the transport it will also eliminate traffic going there so there is a transport outside those who need transport they can make use of it and if there's still space those who like to leave their C they can use that transport as well Shalom [Music] Hallelujah we'll have our our worshippers to sing a song and then then after that and the [Music] [Music] elders so the clarity is that uh the OS let us give priority to those people who don't have transport before we decide to leave our cars behind so those who don't have transport there is eos outside they will go in those buses but then if there is space remaining anyone who wish to leave the car can go in but let us give priority to those who don't have cars to go there amen shall we sing go home I am going home there is nothing to [Music] hold of
