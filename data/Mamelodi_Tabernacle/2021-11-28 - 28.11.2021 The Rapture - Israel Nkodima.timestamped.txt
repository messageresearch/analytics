[1:04:29] that is
[1:04:30] that that is keeping the people busy
[1:04:35] that is the fourth dimension
[1:04:39] even even children
[1:04:42] but we have contact through science
[1:04:48] the fourth dimension
[1:04:50] through
[1:04:52] god
[1:04:55] okay let me talk to the one who can talk
[1:04:58] to me
[1:04:59] through
[1:05:02] signs

[1:05:22] pictures voices
[1:05:26] of radio pictures on television

[1:05:41] a troop that
[1:05:42] picks up those
[1:05:44] um

[1:06:04] we have again
[1:06:07] now through the seventh seal
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:13] signs cannot touch that one
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:23] and it is through this seventh seal
[1:06:28] that we have things that
[1:06:31] you
[1:06:32] wonder
[1:06:36] how these things are sent to us
[1:06:40] in a very special way
[1:06:45] now the troop will bring the seventh
[1:06:48] seal
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:52] it's happening
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:56] amen now through this one now not
[1:06:58] science now through the revelation
[1:07:04] through the word of god
[1:07:07] the way that in the beginning was the
[1:07:10] word
[1:07:14] nothing was made
[1:07:18] there was nothing
[1:07:20] and the bible says
[1:07:23] and
[1:07:24] in the beginning
[1:07:26] was
[1:07:28] science
[1:07:30] in the word
[1:07:33] and the word was with god
[1:07:36] and the word was god
[1:07:42] i was just into i think his brother
[1:07:45] victor
[1:07:46] is here
[1:07:49] that
[1:07:52] the people whom the lord is coming for
[1:07:57] is the word
[1:07:59] [Applause]
[1:08:02] did you know that
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:06] because in the beginning was the red
[1:08:11] and the word was made flesh
[1:08:17] so the church
[1:08:19] is the word that was made
[1:08:22] flesh i'm
[1:08:25] talking about the bride now
[1:08:28] not the church-goer
[1:08:30] not the church member
[1:08:33] but the red
[1:08:35] so he's coming for the red manifested
[1:08:39] word
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] and it is now the ministry of the word
[1:08:50] the ministry of the red to the red
[1:08:53] [Applause]
[1:08:57] this is this ministry
[1:08:59] that's why i've never seen such a
[1:09:02] ministry
[1:09:14] we can't explain to you
[1:09:16] how
[1:09:17] i was with a sister in my office here
[1:09:22] one day
[1:09:23] and
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:25] when
[1:09:26] i heard
[1:09:28] things like
[1:09:30] coming into her cell phone
[1:09:34] and
[1:09:37] we knew a sound like it
[1:09:43] then i said what is that
[1:09:45] she said now
[1:09:46] no they are sending me
[1:09:49] messages
[1:09:52] now i said let me see let me see
[1:09:56] your cell phone
[1:09:58] then she opened to me
[1:10:01] but i could only see
[1:10:03] weddings
[1:10:04] school friends and so forth
[1:10:09] now i said
[1:10:10] but i want to see the things i had
[1:10:18] your cell has been downloading things
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] i heard a sound
[1:10:25] of things coming into your cell phone
[1:10:30] then i said okay
[1:10:32] i know that you've got a
[1:10:35] secret code
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:41] as god has given to his church the
[1:10:43] secret code
[1:10:48] and the secret code
[1:10:52] it has helped us to see the things we
[1:10:55] couldn't see
[1:11:00] all right
[1:11:01] now this
[1:11:02] girl
[1:11:05] i said all right
[1:11:06] oh give me the secret code
[1:11:11] and
[1:11:12] she said no i've given you my code
[1:11:16] i said no not this one
[1:11:18] but the secret i'm a pastor
[1:11:21] i want the secret
[1:11:23] code
[1:11:24] not that one that one is marriage of
[1:11:27] friends and so forth
[1:11:31] and i found her to be willing
[1:11:34] to give to me the secret code
[1:11:39] then i said now open up
[1:11:44] i've got the pictures home
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] i will show to these elders here
[1:11:54] it is
[1:11:55] the pictures beneath the pictures
[1:12:00] now you need another code in order to
[1:12:04] reach those pictures beneath the
[1:12:07] pictures
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] because
[1:12:14] you come to seven churches
[1:12:18] but you need another
[1:12:20] code to go into
[1:12:25] the seals revelation
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:31] the seventh seal is a code
[1:12:35] which is given not to every body
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:40] it's a goal
[1:12:43] that can put you
[1:12:46] beneath
[1:12:48] and beyond
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] so
[1:12:53] these things god has
[1:12:55] put them just like that
[1:12:59] and then
[1:13:00] now you'll wonder
[1:13:10] you know that there is some some codes
[1:13:15] not from a man
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:19] so it's a secret
[1:13:21] in the hands of
[1:13:26] those children of god
[1:13:29] whom he has chosen
[1:13:32] to give
[1:13:34] to them the schools
[1:13:38] thousands
[1:13:40] of them
[1:13:42] all right
[1:13:44] now
[1:13:44] here we are now
[1:13:47] it's opening up now for the rapture
[1:13:52] because they come in stages like that
[1:13:58] that's why i said last time
[1:14:02] we are not talking about the rapture we
[1:14:05] are entering the rapture
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:13] now it will take those
[1:14:15] eternal beings
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:20] whom god has chosen
[1:14:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:28] did you read the bible do you know the
[1:14:30] ephesians chapter
[1:14:33] 1 verse 4 says
[1:14:35] as he has chosen us
[1:14:40] [Applause]
[1:14:41] choosing us away
[1:14:44] in him
[1:14:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:52] you know you can read that scripture
[1:14:54] every day
[1:14:56] as he has chosen us
[1:14:59] in him
[1:15:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:21] comes first as the church ages
[1:15:26] which is time frame
[1:15:30] time frame
[1:15:33] church ages
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:37] but
[1:15:39] after that
[1:15:43] the prophet
[1:15:44] says
[1:15:47] let us
[1:15:49] go our
[1:15:50] past the kitten of time
[1:15:55] because all this time we've been coming
[1:15:58] through the kittens
[1:16:01] messengers are kittens
[1:16:05] this one is opened
[1:16:07] you go through to the other one
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] amen but you finally come to the kitten
[1:16:15] of
[1:16:16] between time and eternity
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:29] if you come beyond the kitten of time
[1:16:34] yes we will read them next next
[1:16:39] amen but now
[1:16:41] let's go back to this one now
[1:16:46] these are the dimensions
[1:16:50] then it says
[1:16:53] the fifth
[1:16:55] dimension
[1:16:58] is where the sinner
[1:17:00] the unbeliever when when the unbeliever
[1:17:03] dies he goes to the fifth dimension
[1:17:07] [Applause]
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:16] a horrible dimension
[1:17:23] actually
[1:17:25] hell was not made for human beings
[1:17:30] but hell was made for satan and his
[1:17:32] angels
[1:17:37] then i asked myself
[1:17:40] meaning that
[1:17:42] those who follow satan and love satan
[1:17:45] are satan's angels
[1:17:52] hell was made
[1:17:54] for satan
[1:17:56] and his angels
[1:17:59] and that's why the prophets say
[1:18:04] in whatever you do
[1:18:07] don't you go that way
[1:18:14] you're talking about fire
[1:18:16] the fire you see here is not the fire
[1:18:20] that's bending there
[1:18:27] all right
[1:18:29] now
[1:18:32] you need to be predestinated
[1:18:36] because a christian
[1:18:38] is not a person who's trying to avoid
[1:18:41] going to hell
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:46] whether there's hell or there's no hell
[1:18:48] he's a christian
[1:18:50] [Applause]
[1:18:53] even if
[1:18:55] the news reached us that the hell has
[1:18:58] been cancelled they will still remain
[1:19:00] christian because that's who they are
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:10] [Music]
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:32] he or she is not made of that thing
[1:19:36] a christian
[1:19:40] was in god
[1:19:43] as chosen in him
[1:19:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] let me repeat even if they can say
[1:19:54] there's no more satan
[1:19:57] they are not christians because there is
[1:19:59] satan
[1:20:02] they are christians
[1:20:05] because they were born by god
[1:20:09] they
[1:20:10] they were born of god
[1:20:13] they don't become christian in fear of
[1:20:15] hell or satan
[1:20:18] they are those eternal beings
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:24] that's a christian
[1:20:28] all right
[1:20:31] now uh
[1:20:32] let's
[1:20:33] turn to this
[1:20:35] this horrible dimension
[1:20:39] the faith
[1:20:41] and when a christian dies
[1:20:45] he goes into the sixth dimension
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:51] and god is in the seventh dimension
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:12] there
[1:21:13] then he said
[1:21:15] i want to see jesus where is jesus
[1:21:19] they said he's still just
[1:21:21] above
[1:21:23] but one day he will come
[1:21:26] he will pick us up here
[1:21:29] and we will go back
[1:21:31] to put on bodies again
[1:21:36] and they said we they said we
[1:21:38] don't eat here there's no numbers here
[1:21:43] what a wonderful place
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:45] [Applause]
[1:21:47] when you die
[1:21:49] and you are in the sixth dimension
[1:21:54] you don't eat
[1:21:55] you don't sleep
[1:21:57] i mean
[1:22:00] there's no
[1:22:03] issues
[1:22:04] there was no tomorrow there
[1:22:08] and there was no yesterday
[1:22:12] those that are here
[1:22:17] but there's only one thing with them
[1:22:20] they are waiting for those they left
[1:22:23] behind
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:27] amen
[1:22:29] we're right
[1:22:31] now i'm going to read this
[1:22:33] and
[1:22:34] we'll close
[1:22:38] now if we go to the bible
[1:22:41] um
[1:22:42] jesus came to die
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:47] why
[1:22:48] because
[1:22:49] we were
[1:22:50] sinners
[1:22:52] you know in the garden
[1:22:55] of eden
[1:22:58] men and women
[1:23:02] that's the tree of life
[1:23:09] men and the
[1:23:11] woman
[1:23:13] the tree of life
[1:23:15] and the tree of knowledge
[1:23:18] yeah that's why you wonder
[1:23:23] brother
[1:23:24] men and women
[1:23:26] in the garden of eden
[1:23:28] was
[1:23:29] the tree of life
[1:23:31] and the tree of knowledge that is men
[1:23:34] and women
[1:23:37] and he said you shall not eat from this
[1:23:40] tree
[1:23:42] but the serpent in you
[1:23:46] when the serpent arrived there
[1:23:49] he went for that tree
[1:23:52] the forbidden fruit
[1:23:57] we can't even outline it even today
[1:24:00] are forbidding fruit
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:04] because they were naked
[1:24:08] and
[1:24:10] they didn't need any suit
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:14] because the glory of god covered them
[1:24:19] they were covered in glory
[1:24:22] there was no lust
[1:24:25] there was no dreams
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:42] them
[1:24:43] was
[1:24:45] satan discipline
[1:24:48] actually
[1:24:49] the sin there
[1:24:51] was the serpent
[1:24:54] that came and undressed them
[1:25:02] he said
[1:25:10] amen and then what happened

[1:28:37] just as we were taken
[1:28:40] out of his sight
[1:28:46] if
[1:28:47] she came out of the sight
[1:28:50] of the man
[1:28:54] amen she was not born
[1:28:58] adam was not born
[1:29:00] it is sin
[1:29:03] that brought about what we call breath
[1:29:09] from the beginning it was not soul
[1:29:14] god just
[1:29:15] molded
[1:29:18] we were not born we were created
[1:29:24] all right
[1:29:26] i think we understand now
[1:29:29] that's why we must be born again
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:35] the bible says if you are not born again
[1:29:39] you shall never see the kingdom of god
[1:29:44] because the first breath
[1:29:48] this breath we call breath
[1:29:51] came through the permissive will of god
[1:29:55] but originally
[1:29:58] we were created not born
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:03] that's why the bible says we must be
[1:30:06] born again
[1:30:10] amen all right
[1:30:12] so now
[1:30:14] i read this now quickly i will come here
[1:30:18] let's go back to this
[1:30:21] my book some of them are so tattered
[1:30:28] but i will fix them in order to carry on
[1:30:34] i'm going back to this again
[1:30:36] paradise
[1:30:39] now
[1:30:41] we want to
[1:30:43] go through this out of this and go up
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:52] so are we together
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:59] death
[1:31:01] brings separation
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:07] now
[1:31:08] i come back to there was a time
[1:31:12] that the people didn't go
[1:31:14] into the presence of god when they died
[1:31:28] them that are
[1:31:31] oh
[1:31:32] all right
[1:31:34] the people didn't go into the presence
[1:31:36] of god when they died
[1:31:38] they justified that was in the old
[1:31:41] testament they went into a place called
[1:31:43] paradise
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:51] and there the source of the just waited
[1:31:54] in paradise
[1:31:58] but paradise was a place where god kept
[1:32:01] the soul in like a dreamland
[1:32:09] until the blood of jesus was shed
[1:32:15] before the blood of jesus was shared
[1:32:19] they were kept in a place called
[1:32:22] paradise
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:27] and the change only came when
[1:32:31] the blood was shed
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] get the book of hebrews
[1:32:42] because
[1:32:43] under the blood of the goats
[1:32:50] that blood covered sin
[1:32:55] but could not take away sin
[1:32:59] but the blood of jesus
[1:33:03] therefore was to
[1:33:05] take away sin
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:11] because
[1:33:15] the bible says for we were all sinners
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:20] born
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:26] and we needed something
[1:33:29] that could make the difference
[1:33:33] and there was nothing the only thing we
[1:33:36] needed was the blood of jesus
[1:33:42] because the blood of jesus christ
[1:33:46] is the word
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:53] uh
[1:33:54] it says
[1:33:57] gabriel
[1:34:00] came to maryland
[1:34:04] with this code
[1:34:06] the blood code
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] now
[1:34:13] and jesus was set aside
[1:34:30] coming
[1:34:31] to mary
[1:34:33] the blood that was brought
[1:34:36] to mary
[1:34:38] was delayed by gabriel
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:45] now that word
[1:34:46] was the blood of god
[1:34:51] and when he spoke to me
[1:34:54] and the mary said be it unto me
[1:34:58] according to your word
[1:35:02] i mean
[1:35:04] that's when the blood
[1:35:07] started
[1:35:09] to form
[1:35:13] in the womb of mary
[1:35:16] what did they call the son of god
[1:35:22] but that was the word that mary has
[1:35:25] received from gabriel
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:31] because if you believe the wording
[1:35:35] it is the blood of god
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:38] in you
[1:35:40] it becomes the blood
[1:35:44] then you are born of god
[1:35:47] if you go for blood tests
[1:35:50] then they will realize that
[1:35:53] with the blood that brought is not human
[1:35:56] blood
[1:35:59] it is the blood of god
[1:36:01] which is the manifested way
[1:36:04] because once it was in mary
[1:36:07] it started to manifest
[1:36:10] and they came a son
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:15] amen
[1:36:17] that is the blood of god
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:20] that's why even now as i said to my
[1:36:23] brother
[1:36:25] this ministry now
[1:36:28] that day has come
[1:36:31] easy for the blood of god
[1:36:36] amen is the ministry of the manifested
[1:36:40] way which is the blood of god
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:48] those people that are to be taken up in
[1:36:50] the rupture
[1:36:53] they are not just mere people
[1:36:56] he is the blood of god
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:37:00] those people
[1:37:02] are amen
[1:37:06] that's why
[1:37:08] some people
[1:37:10] a person asked
[1:37:13] how will these people change
[1:37:17] they will change
[1:37:19] because they are those beings for
[1:37:23] that coming change
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:31] they shall
[1:37:32] take off the mortality
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:37] that's why they knew themselves
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:44] they know
[1:37:46] that they are they have put on
[1:37:49] mortality
[1:37:52] and they must put on immortality
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:56] they know what is immortality
[1:38:00] because they were once immortal
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:09] so they have taken on flesh
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:15] in order to manifest
[1:38:18] and now i'm going back
[1:38:22] this
[1:38:23] rapture in faith
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:26] is not of this body
[1:38:30] it is of another body
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] that's why abraham
[1:38:37] and sarah
[1:38:39] they were changing
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:43] after going without a child
[1:38:46] and abraham said i go without the child
[1:38:49] [Applause]
[1:38:50] and
[1:38:51] the lord god said to him
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:08] that's right
[1:39:11] your your son
[1:39:15] so now the son of god
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:19] yes we are sons
[1:39:21] daughters of god
[1:39:33] that's why the bible says
[1:39:35] he that is born of god
[1:39:38] sinneth not
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:44] why he can't sin
[1:39:46] it is because he is the blood of god
[1:39:51] he is
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:39:58] and found to be sinless
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:06] then
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:18] can never cannot sing
[1:40:23] i'm not talking about cigarette and beer
[1:40:28] i'm talking about sin
[1:40:33] cigarettes
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:48] but why this
[1:40:51] men born of god can't sin
[1:40:57] because
[1:40:59] he is
[1:41:01] the blood of god
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:08] why this one
[1:41:10] although the gospel is preached
[1:41:14] but he he or she cannot change
[1:41:19] nothing can change you can preach
[1:41:23] with conscientious because
[1:41:25] she is of another nature
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:34] she is of another nature
[1:41:36] she knows no righteousness
[1:41:40] she understands doesn't understand
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:42:00] a child of god
[1:42:03] is not a person that is struggling to
[1:42:06] live a holy life
[1:42:10] a child of god is born again
[1:42:17] the bible says
[1:42:20] why he can't sin
[1:42:22] it is because he is born of god
[1:42:36] [Applause]
[1:42:39] can you answer that
[1:42:41] why this one
[1:42:43] who
[1:42:44] lives a holy life
[1:42:48] always he wants to do good
[1:42:53] amen
[1:42:55] but because that is the divine nature
[1:43:00] that's in him
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:04] all right
[1:43:07] all right
[1:43:09] let me read this now
[1:43:14] when they died
[1:43:17] it says
[1:43:19] and
[1:43:21] let me go back
[1:43:27] now they went into a place called
[1:43:29] paradise
[1:43:30] in those days
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:35] and then
[1:43:36] the souls of the just waited in paradise
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:43] god kept them there until
[1:43:46] the
[1:43:47] blood christ shed
[1:43:49] his blood
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:43:59] you notice that
[1:44:00] when he died at calvary
[1:44:08] they are waiting for him
[1:44:11] until he returns
[1:44:16] when he died he brought
[1:44:19] from the grave those dead saints
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:29] that had died under the blood of
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] i read
[1:44:49] there's a rule
[1:44:50] here like in here
[1:44:53] leaves
[1:44:54] mortar
[1:45:00] mortal beings
[1:45:02] and each one is in this great
[1:45:05] conglomeration of guilty
[1:45:11] of darkness
[1:45:14] mortals live living here
[1:45:17] now they are either influenced from this
[1:45:21] way or from that why we have read that
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:28] let's look what happened when the lord
[1:45:30] jesus died
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:34] amen
[1:45:36] i'm going to read it
[1:45:38] because
[1:45:39] if you read
[1:45:42] the book of hebrews
[1:45:46] it tells you about this
[1:45:48] how that
[1:45:54] let's turn to the book of hebrews first
[1:46:06] yes
[1:46:17] yet continually
[1:46:19] make those who come
[1:46:21] to eat perfect
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:52] this is what it says
[1:46:55] for them would they
[1:46:58] not have ceased to be
[1:47:01] offered or offered
[1:47:03] because
[1:47:04] the worshiper
[1:47:06] once
[1:47:07] patched should have had no more
[1:47:11] consciousness of sin
[1:47:14] hank give him a love what was saved
[1:47:19] amen
[1:47:22] but in those sacrifices there
[1:47:27] is a
[1:47:28] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:47:33] year
[1:47:45] because it came undone
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:48:14] grace is when
[1:48:16] sin is taken away from thee
[1:48:19] [Applause]
[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:26] and you are only conscious of
[1:48:28] righteousness
[1:48:33] you're only thinking of how to serve god
[1:48:36] how to please god
[1:48:39] that is the only thing that is in your
[1:48:42] soul
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] a christian
[1:48:50] a predestinated son of god
[1:48:54] is not struggling to quit sin
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:06] jesus was not struggling to quit sin
[1:49:12] amen sin was not found in him
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:16] and if you are born of the blood of god
[1:49:21] sin will never be found in you
[1:49:26] because life is in the blood
[1:49:29] [Applause]
[1:49:32] life in the human blood will continue
[1:49:34] singing
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:38] live
[1:49:39] life
[1:49:50] he will repent
[1:49:52] fully
[1:50:06] um
[1:50:11] where
[1:50:12] even god could no longer tolerate
[1:50:18] the spirit of god
[1:50:21] could no longer tolerate men
[1:50:27] because
[1:50:29] they were born
[1:50:31] born in sin
[1:50:34] bone sinners
[1:50:36] they are children sinners their children
[1:50:39] children sinners
[1:50:42] and
[1:50:42] god said
[1:50:44] now i will take away my spirit
[1:50:47] from all flesh
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:55] now today we have
[1:50:57] some forms of schools and
[1:51:02] institutions
[1:51:05] institutions
[1:51:07] but they won't take away sin
[1:51:13] sin continues
[1:51:19] the more we try to help
[1:51:22] the children
[1:51:25] for to quit the drugs
[1:51:30] the more drugs are coming
[1:51:47] listen
[1:51:50] you'll never never change
[1:51:52] any man
[1:51:58] maybe by talking to him or her
[1:52:02] taking her to church
[1:52:05] trying to do good
[1:52:07] to her to him
[1:52:11] you will never change her or him
[1:52:14] the only thing that can change is the
[1:52:17] blood of god
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:23] amen do you understand
[1:52:26] that's why
[1:52:29] we that are in the realms of eternity
[1:52:35] we reconciles from giving glory glory to
[1:52:39] god
[1:52:43] because
[1:52:44] if we look at what he has made us to be
[1:52:49] we wonder we crave in tears
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:52:54] saying there's no one like you
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:11] rapture is already waiting in you
[1:53:14] [Music]
[1:53:17] if you are a child of god
[1:53:20] divine nature
[1:53:23] the rapture and power the
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:38] that is called the rapture in faith
[1:53:42] there is something in you already
[1:53:45] and that is from god
[1:53:48] and that thing is a countdown in you
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:03] why
[1:54:04] because the power of resurrection
[1:54:08] is already in you
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:12] right
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:15] oh my
[1:54:17] [Applause]
[1:54:19] big paul says
[1:54:22] i know him
[1:54:24] and the power of his resurrection
[1:54:27] [Applause]
[1:54:29] let's look at the power of his
[1:54:31] resurrection
[1:54:34] now the bible says
[1:54:36] if you read this hebrew
[1:54:39] it will tell you
[1:54:41] that
[1:54:43] law could never change them
[1:54:48] amen then he says
[1:54:52] um
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:54] verse 16
[1:54:56] this is the covenant
[1:54:58] that i will
[1:55:00] make with them after
[1:55:03] those days
[1:55:05] said the lord
[1:55:07] i will put my laws into their
[1:55:11] hearts
[1:55:13] amen
[1:55:14] not understood
[1:55:24] because what was in the heart of adam
[1:55:28] he was robbed
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:38] of
[1:55:39] the divine nature god has put in him
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:56] he kept on increasing speed
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:07] you know
[1:56:09] you can find somebody flying
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:39] you know what
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:53] you only can shed tears for such people
[1:56:58] they don't know god
[1:57:02] sister you don't know god
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:07] they don't know
[1:57:09] that's why
[1:57:11] the people
[1:57:14] there's a brother
[1:57:17] one day he was trying to convince
[1:57:20] his daughter
[1:57:24] he hired a
[1:57:29] film
[1:57:32] only the day of judgment
[1:57:36] and the judgment itself
[1:57:39] now there was fire
[1:57:43] that girl when she looked at that fire
[1:57:48] with a
[1:57:49] you know it's just a movie
[1:57:52] people suffering
[1:57:55] he suffered
[1:57:56] he started to attend church
[1:58:02] because she had seen fire
[1:58:05] and she has seen the people how they
[1:58:08] suffer in there
[1:58:10] but yet it was just a movie
[1:58:14] all right
[1:58:16] then after some days
[1:58:21] because every time she would remember
[1:58:23] that fire
[1:58:26] she goes to church
[1:58:31] but
[1:58:33] after a long time
[1:58:35] she forgot about that fire
[1:58:39] and she stopped
[1:58:41] from going to church
[1:58:46] now he said to the father of the girl
[1:58:52] it means that
[1:58:54] you are supposed to keep on playing that
[1:59:00] film
[1:59:02] amen so to keep that fire fear of fire
[1:59:06] in here
[1:59:11] but yet
[1:59:12] that wouldn't say that
[1:59:29] of christ only that can save him
[1:59:33] [Applause]
[1:59:36] all right
[1:59:38] it's like that
[1:59:40] let's see
[1:59:41] when he died
[1:59:44] something happened i've got i've got
[1:59:47] something here
[1:59:50] when he died
[1:59:54] oh i don't know if it is what i need
[1:59:57] here okay
[2:00:00] let's go to
