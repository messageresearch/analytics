Description:
Title: Greater Is He That Is In You than The One That Is In The World
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 04 February 2024

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

I John 4:4 Revelation 21:9 
The place of the word is the soul. If it is not in the soul, it can't be in the mind because the mind is worldly. If you are the seed of Abraham God will walk with you hand in hand and show you things. God said I shall not hide from Abraham the thing that I do, and He told Abraham about Sodom and Gomorrah.
You cannot keep the word of God with your head. Now it is the Soul ministry. Revelation is something that is in your soul. The word stay in the heart and not the heart of flesh but in the soul.
The message believer is not your head but your soul. The sequence of events cannot be kept in the head. If you are a child of God this things are registered in your heart.
The seed of Abraham is the one that can see Melchisedec. The Bride of Christ and the City are built like a pyramid.
Once the prophet say he went westward, you must expect an Angel.
The seventh angel on the earth met the seventh Angel from heaven. 
Your earthly body knows nothing about the rapture. A soul that is going in the rapture, is every time tuned up to the rapture. There is a channel for the rapture, and if a person is a rapture material he is tuned to that channel.
When you receive the message, that word becomes the blood in you. Peter was magnetized to Christ, even when Jesus said get behind me Satan Peter did not react. God is magnetized to you, even though you walk through the shadow of death he is with you.
When something contrary happens, to a child of God, the first thing to think if God is. Jesus said all that the father hath given me no one can take them. If you are a shepherded there are those that God has given you. There is no one that can take you away from God. There is no power that can destroy the church of God.

The Pastor quote from the Spoken word books:

very special attention so they must [Music] be today and the ones that get to be announced to the entire church God bless you amen amen H let's read that [Music] scripture 1 John chapter 4 verse 4 ye

brother amen the Elder there Mike a special prayer for the word after we have read and the proceedings amen amen dear heavenly father once again your word has been read father we we are looking upon you through the power which you in the beginning originally when you spoke when you said let there be light am it was the original spoken word direct from you Elohim amen father this morning this afternoon we are standing before you we have read we have read the Holy scriptures amen which we believe through the mouth of the Prophet that it is a a God in a written form God in a book form and uh we are coming to you Lord knowing that this word you spoke through holy prophets men of old trusted upon you when they wrote this word it was through a revelation the very same Revelation that you said you'll build your church amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it father this morning we are standing before you with our Bibles in our hands amen Lord we have read the scriptures but you are the one who can Quicken them amen you are the one to direct them amen Lord direct to each and every heart because you said your word is powerful and quick than a double HED sord amen father this morning we are standing before you with the josua of our day our pastor is standing before us as a commander in chief Hallelujah of those Supernatural soldiers armies from Heaven fighting against the spirit of Satanism father we are standing before you against all the power of principalities the Antichrist that is happening the spirit of denominationalism the spirit of worshiping ancestral father is the word that is still creative that was read and preached by our Lord Jesus Christ that all powers cannot stand against it amen father as our pastor standing before us with the power of the opening of The Seven seal of the Revelation that you have given to us that may you speak boldly Lord yes Father make him his mouth to speak and say what you have put in his heart for all these years Lord he's been standing before us delivering the word and we saw your word performing Miracles amen delivering the sick calling people from different sicknesses father getting healed at this point in time we commanded the word to go in the heart of each and everyone and also our pastor in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you God bless you uh you may be seated all right amen I was also listening this morning to the songs all right amen I'm going to keep time and wonderful singing amen amen and I was listening to this young sisters how they sing praise the Lord amen amen and uh uh last week after last week after the weekend I asked the brothers uh because somebody came here also uh with something vessel like something for water amen amen and then the people don't know that God speaks to us as well as he spoke today to Peter then after that because she was supposed also to get the water from the Well from the pool and I commanded the Saints to empty the pool and wash amen amen don't if you come the pool is clean to collect water from the pool all right they don't know we are not in darkness we are not in dark amen all right God bless you all we will continue the Rapture is just at the door all SS that the Lord predicted they will happen we see them the sons the seed of God children of Abraham or the Seed of Abraham H they are so blessed because they are able to see these things we are looking at the floods Global not like the Poli politicians but the scripture say the Lord Jesus himself as it was in the days of Lord and as it was the days of Noah so the same the same thing shall repeat itself amen amen okay amen maybe two or three of us here can say I have seen I I have seen with my eyes and with my heart the prophecy of Jesus Christ it shall be like the days of L days of I was just with the brothers talking about these things said I said remember in the days of Lord what happened it was fire amen amen amen and uh do you remember that here it started with fire in this world amen amen just as predicted in the days of Lord was fire now in the days of Noah was water amen amen is it not [Music] happen almost the whole world only that there something special Abraham never was he part of this things it never happened where Abraham was amen amen Abraham knew about it when s started to burn the Bible says Abraham up early in the morning and he stood before the Lord amen amen then is then he saw Sodom smoke going he was not part of it he only saw it amen am the Seed of Abraham is not part of it but they see it because the Lord has spoken and these things now have been manifested all right amen H there was where the prophet of God spoke of something here and uh although the our part of which we are going to run it Greater is he that is in us us which one all right amen let me look at something here you know I we read something some time back from the book ashamed of him page five paragraph one where the men of God said my Ministry isn't finished in Africa then I've got this part here that says a prophet visits South Africa afria then it says here where he said to the people got to go to Africa according to a vision all right am and you know of some other quotations where he spoke about Africa and not for politics he he said uh he spoke about the one who is did he say more spiritual or a vision what what did it say about the African all right you don't know okay all right amen um let's start here and uh because we have read the scripture on the agenda the following to happen is now the rupture so I believe you are listening what's on the agenda the the next thing to happen is the rapture amen when soon and very soon then we have go after that which forces are reging again and the prophet says now when the bride takes off the the battles will start and you GL that you are not part of those you know Abraham Abraham when maybe the newspapers would go around saying we see the sign of Fire or the sign of what amen amen that was not Abraham's news no because he was not part of it now the chaos that is coming you as a son or daughter of God it's not for you I what's left for you is rupture nothing else you won't B amen the water won't touch you because that was not the promise for the bride amen your promise now what is left for you is the rupture amen and all these other things follow after the rupture before anything happens God must whisk amen amen that's why she's happy even this morning Abraham ABR was not part of you but he saw it and said I stood before the and right amen then tribulation after that do you know what tribulation is like that's why my Prophet said in everything you do don't go that way the tribulation Peri uh I W read this things today oh they left the others all right no problem I will come with them here something like that uh did you know we read of these things but I will bring back some concerning this time because that time has arrived he spoke of in that diagram I'll bring it will H that spoke of the 3 and a half years of Christ and 3 and a half years of Lucifer amen all right amen now Christ has prophesied then he went back I mean in the that form but he came back to us in the form of the Holy Ghost and at the end time he came with a prophecy like he did with Abraham all right amen now we have them here tribulation tribulation perod now the forces are gathering world is battles amen amen and it looks like the area if you look at Israel do you see the battles these days church do you see what is happening these days what is happening with the Jews what is happening with the Gentiles amen according to the prophecy the Battle of go and MOG which by God's grace we did bring it both M the first one and the last one didn't we bring amen well amen these things don't remain in the mind of men the place of the word is the soul if it is not in the soul then it can't remain in the mind because mind is worldly it can take something now tomorrow it has forgotten all about but if it is in the soul as we are going to look for it for few minutes uh what was supposed uh to be preached it's now over if it is not in your soul that's all you know God said let them be light and they he never repeated later I have said let no once his word goes out and it will be fulfilled amen it won't be repeated let there be light that's all then follows manifestation and there was [Music] life amen he never repeat it again no if God says something you are his child it is like he said let there be sister how are you I see you are coming towards the pit the time you you arrive here the Rapture will take place you see if you are a child of God where's the sister here sister okay sister the sister I prayed for during the week what's your name again okay I was told that she is sick and I asked the brother also to bring the sister in the office after the service want to check something we are also doctors reading up amen want to trace you know the ministry of this kind I want to thank God we through him we can be able to trade amen amen that is through him because some of the things are uncal they are coming from back there now God has given us the tool to trace these things somebody said what's wrong with this church in mam but I don't believe that we are a church in M but we are a church in [Applause] Christ all right amen they say sometimes you see one of them going up the mountain amen amen but and some people they do uh would you ask Moses why sometimes you went up the mountain okay no I he was that was his mission all right amen now greater no I was reading this things tribulation period of Millennium I wish we go back to Millennium again because Millennium millenum that's why you see 144,000 144,000 of the Jew what are they called yes [Music] amen Millennium but we will pass that way Millennium Here Comes again we went through that is there anyone here who can uh rewind back to the first one and the second one amen you see this thing the ministry is not just not Jesus yes he but after that he shows you things real Christianity when you talk about real Christianity we are not talking about a nonsmoker no we are talking about somebody with the knowledge of God in him and all the events he said shall I hide from Abraham the things that I do so if you are a Seed of Abraham then God goes hand in hand with you he will show you all this Abraham now I'm going to and he said before the fire there he said shall I hide from Abraham he couldn't because Abraham was part of you amen we went through this thing Battle of amagon Amen I fear to ask you question this we were with the brothers home they are here I the question was of who fighting amen I found that it's there you see amen now I realize that the word of God you can have slides with you but still you have no answer because the ministry does not reside in the slides but in the [Applause] heart the word of God doesn't on the slide in the heart the soul soul is the one that contains all this amen like you realize like now H Soul Ministry it's a soul Ministry because all the things that God spoke not really but living in your soul you cannot keep the word of God with your head theology it becomes theology but theology is not Revelation Theology and Revelation is not theology Revelation is something amen you know he says the seven colors of the rainbow they came The Next Step from there he speaks of the logos is the thing you receive the word with army the word does not reign in the head the word stays in the heart amen not the the physical heart refer to the soul it refers to the soul amen now how the soul soul how it is able to keep these things it is because uh to you there is no starting point of those things you were in his mind before the foundation of the world you see that scripture says grieve not the holy spirit of God that scripture my brother we were chosen before now the world that's why the Bible says Luke 17 we are not of this warant amen is that right that means knowledge knowled it is not or it not start with this world Amen is that right you've got what knowledge do you have there's some men that said when they were talking about education because when you got born you didn't have any education amen amen amen education is something that comes to your head but the word of God does not come to the Head ler to the soul it comes to the soul amen the soul soul is The Keeper of the word of God that's why who is this why in the book who is this madc where he says uh your soul is subject I'm trying to put it the real body that can keep the word of God is the soul the message believer it's not your head it's your soul how come that you find the people uh he comes here all things then he goes into things I hear them say going to things but who is going to things you see amen but the child of God God stays in the soul not this fleshly this one just PMS blood only when you die it stops amen there's no longer anything to do with blood there okay amen millenum Millennium another white Throne judgment white judgment New Jerusalem you can't keep these things you can't keep them in your head the the place of all these things the Rapture ble of Millennium millenum another white thr judgment New Jerusalem all these things they are not they are not without if you are a child of God they are registered your soul amen that's the thing all right before we Clos I was looking at this H there was this scripture where it says come up here come here Revelation chapter 21 there's two places you have Revelation chter 4 where where it says come up here and I will show you things to come you should know that if you are a child of God as he said about Abraham shall I hide from Abraham Abraham being the seed so God has to talk to Abraham if he's going to burn Sodom he tells Abraham everything he told Abraham everything now if that was it even today he's talking to the seed if you plant wheat the seed because the the power of the whole structure is coming from all right Amen in everything you do it's from the [Music] seed amen why they say Seed of Abraham it is a seed that will grow to see another seat will never see amen it hasn't got that law of growth amen it can't for it to see it is a seed now the Seed of Abraham could see MC was God was Jesus but for the citiz and the citizens of amen amen they know we are coming there we are going to if the Lord willing we we've got that building because the city is built like a pyramid and the bride of Christ shap like a pyramid amen all right amen now these things are not for a church go it's for the seed amen you change into something else no as the if the seed is wheat there's no way you can convince it of something else once planted it comes up to reproduce seed the same seed all right let's look at this now I was just reading this showing this events here now the last one it said Revelation chapter 21 uh can we read it perhaps Revelation 21 from verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen amen that's why we've heard us talking about angels now because we were let up today about angels the reason the people they say the seven is not revealed they didn't even see the angel with the seven didn't we see it the angel with now that's why a m man cannot see it with the angel amen amen and the prophet of God was even put into the Pyramid of those angels then the ministry as you see the ministry now he had to [Music] go let me tell you st man was put in Eden but now you hear the prophet always says I went w then once if he says I went West expect an angel amen [Music] I went West to pick up because when I will read it to you when he was put into the conell constellation of the Angels uh I've been following [Music] and hearing people talking never have i at any time somebody talking about the revelation of the angels and to know where the seventh is it's when after you have seen the seventh angel not a man at this time amen the seventh angel here on met the seventh uh the rupture Rapture can take uh uh I don't know how much I weigh but these days I wait has left me a bit now I don't believe that your body of Flesh knows anything about the [Music] it is like there there there's some people there's two things here your your body your natural man can talk about the rupture amen amen but if you look at that person you don't see any sign of rapture with such a person a person a soul that is going in the rupture is every time tuned up to the channel because these things come like channels there's a channel for the RT and once a person has been called and is the rapture material he knows the channel because already in that person you know sometimes you even feel like you you saying to yourself here is the rupture you are so much ready for the Rapture you can feel it [Applause] and every time there is something in you that it's not only soon and very soon but it's something in you know like H spiritually sing that something is about to happen something to take you see things like that that's why the Bible says of Enoch he didn't only read about no he started working because it was already in him why he started to walk and the Bible says he walked with God and he was am beautiful yourself also if you start to walk with God you will end up like Enoch he walked with God and he was meaning that God was in him in so much that his steps every time he walked it would be with God amen amen you know that I've seen some beeds before they can start flipping their wings they start by running amen with a strong uh long legs and they even land like a flying machine F machine they land running F because flying machine it doesn't just drop like no it comes down on the runway and if it about to take off it start on the runway amen okay amen I don't know how much are how many are on the runway more way amen amen they are not sto by their money in the bank they don't have future here did you know the children of God have got no future [Music] and let's finish that one says come up here Revelation 21 and I will show you the bride okay amen I believe believe that if they say the bread of Christ they are not referring to the people who read the spok amen because I've seen the people reading the spoken and they will hate you and I don't know like but spoken with a spoken word in their hands spoken hatred with spoken word God is love his love is not like human love imagine say he loves you because of this that's why maybe sometimes sometimes someone works in the butcher you you lovers of meat now if he works in the buter he always bring meat you meat at home and you start developing some kind of love even when you speak they say they not like you know that has got a good just because he's bringing you meat now we are not talking about such kind of love it says for so God loved amen those who gave him meat no God loved the world he gave his only begotten son that is the love of God amen amen the Lord Jesus Christ was not crucified because he's done something you must realize know that the Lord Jesus Christ was God in [Music] flesh now his love was manifested when he thought of you as the king's man he couldn't stand Al while you are in sin because you are part of him now he came down and took your form amen I mean the body when he was born it was he looked like any other baby the wisdom of God [Music] that's why I was looking at it this morning it says you know when Mary was supposed to bring forth a son that's why Joseph who was supposed to be the father was pushed [Music] amen then came Gabriel not not Joseph isn't all right amen you can be born and have Earthly father and mother amen but only that in reality you are not their child [Applause] now Mary Maria Joseph Joseph they couldn't claim he had the he went around to pick up the disciples they were in the book of Heaven as his disciples amen amen also now he says but me being your father now you are not choosing me but he knew very well that Joseph is not his [Applause] father Gabriel now Gabriel came and Gabriel when he got there the seed the seed of God when he spoke to Mary it says that word became blood in the womb of Mary there was nothing human there that word in Mary became blood am that's why you people message of God when you accept the message amen amen that message in you is the blood of God that's why the Bible says we are sa the blood of God Amen the blood of God this revelation of the seals and so forth that is the blood of God now you look at the letter form but that is not the letter is not the blood the word you know the you read the Bible you have the Bible and you can go to the highest Bible school you know it won't help you you don't know God by reading it is by predestination he has predestinated you and at the appoint time comes to you amen the way that you hear becomes blood in is that right yeah it becomes blood in you that's why we say we are saved by the blood the blood of Christ all right amen Lord that's it amen and I will read the last thing CL there yeah that is that is that the Rapture uh they say it is like a magnetic Stone and that there is something in you magneti to something you know people like Peter they were mag when he says to Peter depart from you Satan Hallelujah did Peter react because he is magnetized to [Music] Christ you see this head is part of my Earthly body sometimes [Music] when you struggle with Ms you always hit yourself but that won that won help you now in you he becomes maged though you walk in the valy but yet he is with me he wanted to take me through this he is with me all right amen now if you are a Christian you get so magnetized to Christ beautiful amen amen whether you have or no food whe people love you only when God loves you amen amen long God loves you don't search for the love from the Love from the people no the Bible says for God and he acted because he took the form your form in order to save me am he died for you what love is that can a man die for you [Music] that love and he knew that as the king's man to save you he has to shed blood that is to save you if you know this Seven Seals and that is the blood of God Amen that's right but when in you in your soul the word of God becomes blood in you that's why there is power in the blood amen healing power is that righten Lord
