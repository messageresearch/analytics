[34:55] God.
[35:04] Gracious Lord, heavenly father.
[35:26] like to thank you gracious heavenly
[35:28] father we have felt the spirit of God as
[35:30] we were worshiping
[35:33] giving God all the glory and honor
[35:36] you have said father gracious heavenly
[35:39] father we have been built in the
[35:41] foundation of the apostles
[35:44] where gracious heavenly father one day
[35:47] The revelation
[35:49] was given to Peter and said Peter
[35:53] thou art the son of the living God.
[35:57] You said Peter this revelation is not
[35:59] coming from you but it is the father
[36:02] that has revealed it to you.
[36:06] We are build gracious heavenly father
[36:09] because Lord you wanted us to be built
[36:12] in the ministry that we have left
[36:15] &gt;&gt; with the disciples.
[36:17] Go back graciously father to what you
[36:21] wanted us to be from the foundation of
[36:23] the world.
[36:25] Today father we are singing
[36:30] because gracious heavenly father we have
[36:32] found out that the plan that god had
[36:36] from the foundation of the world. It was
[36:38] the plan, Father, to prepare your bride,
[36:41] gracious Lord, to be holy, Father, to
[36:46] adhere to the word of the Lord at at
[36:49] this time, gracious heavenly father, so
[36:52] that we can be worthy to be with you one
[36:55] of the days. And we believe that soon
[36:58] and very soon, Father, we'll be out of
[37:01] this world, gracious heavenly father, to
[37:04] be with the Lord forever and ever,
[37:06] whereby we will never have any problems.
[37:09] We'll never have gracious heavenly
[37:12] father,
[37:14] we will never have, gracious heavenly
[37:16] father any gossip. We'll never have, but
[37:19] we will be with the Lord forever and
[37:22] ever.
[37:25] One day the pastor when he was preaching
[37:28] he said I'm not preaching to everyone
[37:31] but I'm preaching to the minority
[37:34] and that minority it is the one gracious
[37:37] heavenly father that stood where Abraham
[37:42] one day the Bible says he stood where
[37:45] God was standing and he could manage to
[37:49] see gracious heavenly father a far
[37:52] things that were far but he could see
[37:54] them closer.
[37:55] because he was standing where God was.
[37:58] Gracious Lord, we are standing. There's
[38:01] a song says that here we stand and
[38:05] proclaim victory. The victory that is
[38:08] coming, that is here. And the father we
[38:11] know that Lord you are always with us.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; We cast every demonic power.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; We cast out devils.
[38:20] We cast out every pain that the devil
[38:22] has planned
[38:24] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; We pray gracious Lord for the reading of
[38:31] the word this morning. The man that we
[38:34] have placed we are going to place behind
[38:35] this pullpit. We pray that father let
[38:38] the word comes from the heart of the
[38:40] lord that will build us gracious
[38:43] heavenly father and prepare father for
[38:46] your coming. We want to thank you father
[38:49] that those who are sick they are being
[38:51] healed this morning. Those father who
[38:53] needs God they are going to find him
[38:55] this morning. Those father who've got
[38:58] problems their problems they are going
[38:59] to be met this morning because we have
[39:02] come to the god of the god who's always

[39:07] over Israel. Thank you heavenly father.

[1:11:38] When he
[1:11:41] shout
[1:11:46] to
[1:11:48] let me
[1:11:54] of what
[1:11:56] should be
[1:11:59] as he
[1:12:02] has declared
[1:12:04] to his
[1:12:08] prophets.
[1:12:10] Behold,
[1:12:12] I will send you
[1:12:16] and I
[1:12:19] prophet
[1:12:21] before
[1:12:26] and
[1:12:32] he
[1:12:34] shall mountains
[1:12:40] of the fathers
[1:12:43] to their children.
[1:12:46] The hearts
[1:12:49] of the children
[1:12:51] to their father.
[1:12:55] Yes,
[1:12:57] I
[1:13:03] am.
[1:13:05] It's not
[1:13:28] host.
[1:13:31] We will bound
[1:13:53] his
[1:14:01] Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; I greet you all saints in the name of my
[1:14:10] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:18] I believe the Lord is good.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we are all happy.
[1:14:27] Amen.
[1:14:29] May the Lord bless you.
[1:14:33] Oh,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; without wasting time, I'll go straight
[1:14:36] to the scriptures.
[1:14:42] I would like us to read the book of
[1:14:45] Hebrews.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Uh chapter 11.
[1:14:56] We'll read the first verse
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; and the sixth verse.
[1:15:06] Hebrews chapter 11 verse one.
[1:15:10] Now faith is the substance of things
[1:15:13] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[1:15:16] seen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Verse six, but without faith it is
[1:15:20] impossible to please him. For he that
[1:15:23] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:15:26] and that he is the rewarder of them that
[1:15:28] diligently seek him.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Peter, can you lead us in
[1:15:34] prayer?
[1:15:37] Most gracious eternal heavenly father
[1:15:41] once more this morning we are gathered
[1:15:43] in this place we are standing on holy
[1:15:47] ground
[1:15:48] lord this place is not for everyone oh
[1:15:53] god this is the place where our elder
[1:15:57] Israel stood morana now we have our
[1:16:01] elder that the kosana standing this
[1:16:03] morning lord we want hear from your God.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear from people, but
[1:16:10] we want to hear from the father.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; We want it to be from heart to heart.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Because that's what makes the
[1:16:17] difference, oh God.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, may our hearts burn as you speak
[1:16:21] unto us with your word. Your word has
[1:16:24] been read, oh God. May you bless it, oh
[1:16:27] God. Anoint it, oh God. Give it the
[1:16:29] inspiration that when we go out of this
[1:16:32] place, we will not be the same. Oh God,
[1:16:35] we shall give you all the honor and all
[1:16:37] the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:40] Christ. Amen. And amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:16:49] Okay. Before I give you the title,
[1:16:55] I just want you to be settled.
[1:17:00] because I know maybe
[1:17:03] some of you might
[1:17:06] think that
[1:17:08] I might say some things that are out of
[1:17:10] order.
[1:17:17] No, I'm old enough.
[1:17:20] I will never say anything that would
[1:17:22] disturb me.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; One day I was with a pastor
[1:17:38] and not brother but his father. There
[1:17:41] was a pastor that was preaching,
[1:17:44] not pastor, another pastor.
[1:17:50] And then that pastor said,
[1:18:02] what you consumed.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And the pastor looked at me
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; and then he shook his head.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; This man does not know that these are
[1:18:14] souls
[1:18:22] in your life.
[1:18:24] You must never do what these people
[1:18:29] years back.
[1:18:32] So
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; and he will stand behind this pulpit.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; But these are the souls of God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; When you speak to them, know that you're
[1:18:46] speaking to the souls of God.
[1:18:52] He will say, "Okay, as a pastor,
[1:18:56] I have to straighten the church.
[1:19:01] But you people,
[1:19:04] you are just preachers.
[1:19:07] I the pastor
[1:19:09] will say some things
[1:19:12] to straighten the church.
[1:19:16] So ours
[1:19:19] is just to uplift the church
[1:19:24] and then the pastors
[1:19:27] will be the one
[1:19:30] Maybe that will say some things that
[1:19:33] might surprise you.
[1:19:37] We we'll just go to the scriptures
[1:19:40] and teach you what the scriptures
[1:19:43] and edify the church.
[1:19:49] Right. Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; So I just want you to be settled along
[1:19:52] those line.
[1:19:57] I know that you've heard lot of things.
[1:20:02] I won't talk about those things. May the
[1:20:04] Lord bless you all.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Now my title here is a quickening
[1:20:15] spirit.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Quickening spirit.
[1:20:22] We we are talking about rapture
[1:20:31] that is around the corner
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and then uh there are promises
[1:20:42] that are leading towards the rapture.
[1:20:47] The last message that the pastor
[1:20:49] preached
[1:20:54] The title was man has lost his image. I
[1:20:59] don't know whe they still remember that
[1:21:08] right now. There are some promises
[1:21:13] that God gave us
[1:21:17] of which we need to believe them.
[1:21:22] and we need to faithfully believe them.
[1:21:27] That's why uh uh the first verse that
[1:21:30] I've read,
[1:21:33] it has to do with faith.
[1:21:36] It says fa faith is a substance.
[1:21:41] Substance.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody knows that verse.
[1:21:48] Our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:52] said,
[1:21:54] "I will build my church."
[1:21:59] It
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; It seems we don't believe that.
[1:22:03] Didn't say anybody else will build it.
[1:22:08] He said himself
[1:22:11] will build his church.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And if we can just believe that
[1:22:18] who will stop running around
[1:22:22] because it's himself
[1:22:25] that will build it.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:22:33] in uh the sixth verse
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; or let's start from verse five.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Verse five.
[1:22:44] Now here we're talking about the
[1:22:46] quickening spirit.
[1:22:52] Uh
[1:22:53] to quicken is to make alive.
[1:22:59] It's divine giving.
[1:23:05] Before the rapture,
[1:23:08] our bodies must change,
[1:23:12] right? Amen. We need to have a spirit
[1:23:17] that will change our bodies.
[1:23:20] Amen. Right?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Otherwise,
[1:23:25] rapture
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; it's not a story,
[1:23:31] it's lifeure.
[1:23:35] It's life that our body are going to
[1:23:37] change
[1:23:41] and it's a promise.
[1:23:44] that our body are going to change.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; But there's some events
[1:23:53] that have to uh uh trans we need to see.
[1:23:59] There's some promises
[1:24:03] and those promises
[1:24:05] will tell us
[1:24:08] how far is the rapture.
[1:24:13] We might not know the day.
[1:24:16] We might not know the hour.
[1:24:19] But there are signs.
[1:24:22] They will tell you the signs.
[1:24:25] You you will see by the signs
[1:24:28] that now
[1:24:30] things are become worse.
[1:24:35] He is always around the corner.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; When we worship God,
[1:24:44] we need to look at the events
[1:24:48] of how far are we,
[1:24:52] where are we,
[1:24:54] in which dispensation are we?
[1:24:58] And in that dispensation,
[1:25:01] are we in the middle or in the beginning
[1:25:05] or at the end? There are promises
[1:25:09] that will tell you that at the end there
[1:25:13] will be this and this.
[1:25:16] Then you look at those things.
[1:25:19] Then you will know where you are.
[1:25:22] Then you will settle down
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:27] concentrate and pray over those things.
[1:25:33] Now before the quickening of our body,
[1:25:39] there should be a squeeze.
[1:25:44] It's a promise.
[1:25:46] That's the pro prophet came with it.
[1:25:50] said that there's going to be a squeeze
[1:25:53] before our bodies change.
[1:25:58] Are we together?
[1:26:00] Now
[1:26:02] those promises
[1:26:06] are sort of highlight
[1:26:12] when you see reactions
[1:26:17] or or certain reactions.
[1:26:20] Those reactions
[1:26:22] tells you
[1:26:24] that it's time now
[1:26:27] of the transformation
[1:26:31] from physical to spiritual.
[1:26:36] Our bodies are going to change.
[1:26:39] But there are signs that needs to tell
[1:26:41] you
[1:26:43] promises pertaining to that.
[1:26:48] Now verse five.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Verse five. What does it say?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; By faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:26:55] should not see death and was not found
[1:26:58] because God hath translated him. For
[1:27:01] before his translation, he had his
[1:27:03] testimony that pleased God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:27:08] it says
[1:27:10] Enoch
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Enoch
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; was translated.
[1:27:15] But what what translated him or what
[1:27:18] made him to be translated?
[1:27:23] Because the Bible says before his
[1:27:26] translation,
[1:27:29] he had this testimony
[1:27:34] that he pleased God.
[1:27:38] There are certain conditions
[1:27:42] that God placed
[1:27:45] that before you are translated,
[1:27:49] you have to go through this.
[1:27:53] You cannot be translated
[1:27:57] if you don't see far.
[1:28:02] If you see things vividly,
[1:28:07] you can't be translated.
[1:28:10] You have to understand
[1:28:13] and have a knowledge
[1:28:15] and be seasoned
[1:28:18] and grow spiritually
[1:28:21] that if something happens.
[1:28:24] You don't look a person.
[1:28:27] You look the other side.
[1:28:32] You look the spirit that is involved
[1:28:36] in
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and then you don't fight that person.
[1:28:40] I'm telling you, I'm a seasoned person.
[1:28:46] You fight that spirit
[1:28:49] that is hiding there,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; right? Otherwise,
[1:28:56] you're going to be disturbed
[1:28:59] because God
[1:29:01] wants you
[1:29:04] to please him.
[1:29:06] He has given you
[1:29:09] promises,
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Let's read the book of uh
[1:29:17] second Peter.
[1:29:19] The book of second Peter. Remember
[1:29:21] remember it says here
[1:29:24] before his translation
[1:29:28] he had this testimony
[1:29:31] that he pleased God.
[1:29:36] Don't think that the devil
[1:29:40] and his demons
[1:29:43] will let will will let you go to heaven
[1:29:46] on a rocking chair.
[1:29:54] That's why the Bible
[1:29:57] says
[1:29:59] he that overcome.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; So there's something that need to
[1:30:06] happen.
[1:30:08] Each and every one of us
[1:30:11] have to overcome.
[1:30:15] You see,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham Abraham
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; when he met me,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; it's after
[1:30:24] he overcame.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; We have a ministry.
[1:30:30] Our ministry is the revelation
[1:30:35] of the seventh seal.
[1:30:39] Revelation
[1:30:40] of the seven.
[1:30:43] What is it?
[1:30:45] It's Christ himself.
[1:30:49] When he's in you
[1:30:51] in the form of the word
[1:30:54] and when he's in you
[1:30:56] in the form of the word that makes you
[1:30:59] Christ.
[1:31:01] That makes you cry.
[1:31:03] That makes you a minor God.
[1:31:07] Now being a minor God,
[1:31:11] you can call things the prophet says
[1:31:16] when he says the word is in the bride.
[1:31:20] He says the bride has got thus said the
[1:31:22] Lord.
[1:31:26] But he says he knows what to do.
[1:31:31] Thus said the Lord.
[1:31:35] He's not using it hazard.
[1:31:41] If God
[1:31:43] was haphazard,
[1:31:47] not even a single one of us will be
[1:31:49] alive by now.
[1:31:54] We were all born in sins.
[1:31:59] shaped in iniquity.
[1:32:02] We need to remember that.
[1:32:05] It is just by his grace.
[1:32:09] Any any power that we have,
[1:32:14] we should use it accordingly.
[1:32:20] When we speak about the power of the
[1:32:22] third P,
[1:32:24] when we speak about the revelation of
[1:32:26] the word,
[1:32:28] We speak about nothing else but Christ
[1:32:30] himself
[1:32:33] in the form of the way. And now if
[1:32:36] Christ
[1:32:38] came to you,
[1:32:40] let me put it like this.
[1:32:43] We will go to the scripture
[1:32:49] in the book of Ephesians chapter one. I
[1:32:53] think it verse you don't have to open
[1:32:55] it. You know it.
[1:32:59] The Bible speaks about the things in
[1:33:01] heaven.
[1:33:04] It speaks about the things here on
[1:33:06] earth.
[1:33:08] Says those that are in earth,
[1:33:11] they will go up.
[1:33:13] Those that are on heaven, they will come
[1:33:15] down. They will meet in Christ.
[1:33:20] Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; uh
[1:33:25] the prophet speaks about the two books,
[1:33:30] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[1:33:33] life.
[1:33:35] Says when you are born, you are born in
[1:33:36] the book of life
[1:33:40] and then from there on you are
[1:33:43] transferred to the lamb's book.
[1:33:47] Then he speaks about
[1:33:51] the the seed and the chuck.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; So when you plant this when you plant
[1:34:01] the seed,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; it germinates
[1:34:06] and on and on and on until it produce
[1:34:10] the seed itself.
[1:34:12] Then you separate the sh from the seat.
[1:34:20] Now the seed
[1:34:23] has got a life
[1:34:26] right. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And that life you cannot destroy it
[1:34:32] belongs to that seed.
[1:34:34] But that shark
[1:34:38] it life ends up when you harvest it.
[1:34:46] after harvesting
[1:34:49] the shark is useless.
[1:34:53] Now if one
[1:34:57] uh is uh from a god
[1:35:02] I mean if you are from God
[1:35:06] predestinated
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; before the foundation
[1:35:10] there's nothing
[1:35:12] that you can do. There's nothing that
[1:35:16] somebody can do.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; You are that life.
[1:35:23] Are we together? Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; So now if you are that life,
[1:35:27] you will know that you are that life.
[1:35:31] You won't jump around and try to do
[1:35:33] something.
[1:35:35] You know,
[1:35:37] you are the seed of God.
[1:35:40] You are not pretending.
[1:35:43] Okay, let's read the uh u
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; first pet I mean second Peter
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; second Peter
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; chapter uh second Peter chapter
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; 2 I want you to read verse four
[1:35:57] verse four
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse4
[1:36:03] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:36:06] great and precious promises
[1:36:08] that by this ye might be partakers of
[1:36:11] the divine nature
[1:36:13] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:36:15] the world through lust.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Now here
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Peter says
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; he says
[1:36:23] uh whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:36:28] great and precious promises.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Just remember that You are given.
[1:36:44] It's not you who produce that.
[1:36:48] It comes from God.
[1:36:50] You're given that
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; and something that we are given. And he
[1:36:54] says
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; uh they had given unto us all things
[1:37:01] sorry whereby are given unto us
[1:37:04] exceeding
[1:37:06] great
[1:37:09] and precious promises.
[1:37:19] God cannot give you a promise
[1:37:22] and don't fulfill it.
[1:37:25] If he says he will build his church
[1:37:30] that is a promise he will fulfill.
[1:37:37] Are we together? Now if he says the word
[1:37:41] is in the bride
[1:37:43] is him the word
[1:37:46] is him in you.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; And remember he continues and says that
[1:37:55] by this
[1:37:58] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:38:01] nature.
[1:38:06] There is a nature
[1:38:09] that is divine and to have a divine
[1:38:12] nature,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; you must be quickened.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; There are promises
[1:38:22] that he gives you
[1:38:25] and with those promises,
[1:38:28] it's leading you
[1:38:31] to the quickening.
[1:38:36] Right.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:38:40] you don't lead yourself.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You don't try and shake yourself up.
[1:38:49] You were given
[1:38:52] those things. So might you might be
[1:38:55] partakers of the divine nature.
[1:39:01] It's a promise. He gives you if you want
[1:39:05] to be like me,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; here are the promise.
[1:39:10] That's what he gave Enoch
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; and he looked at Enoch
[1:39:16] and he was happy about what he was doing
[1:39:21] that testimony and he was pleased
[1:39:25] and he gave us promises
[1:39:28] as his bride
[1:39:31] and we will walk according to those
[1:39:33] promises
[1:39:35] until we are raptured.
[1:39:39] How are we together? It's a promise. It
[1:39:42] comes from him.
[1:39:44] And he cannot say a thing
[1:39:47] that will never manifest.
[1:39:51] Whatever he says,
[1:39:54] it will be manifested.
[1:39:57] Amen. Let me say to you,
[1:40:00] this is not the time
[1:40:04] of trying to correct anybody.
[1:40:11] Look, the devil is very late.
[1:40:17] Are
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; we together? The opening of a seven,
[1:40:22] finished up everything.
[1:40:30] So it's either you have crossed the line
[1:40:36] or we didn't cross the line but it
[1:40:39] finished up everything.
[1:40:42] This is the time
[1:40:44] of the manifestation
[1:40:46] of the scriptures that says,
[1:40:50] "Let he
[1:40:53] that is holy
[1:40:55] be holy still
[1:40:58] and let he
[1:41:00] is filthy.
[1:41:07] It's not time for correction.
[1:41:11] You cannot correct somebody
[1:41:14] that has crossed over.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You can't bring him back.
[1:41:23] Look,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:41:27] after resurrection,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; he went back to heaven,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; He became a mediator.
[1:41:37] That was a time where somebody must
[1:41:40] repent.
[1:41:44] He
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; he was a redeemer.
[1:41:46] Redeemer us with his blood.
[1:41:49] He was a mediator,
[1:41:52] right? Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And after that
[1:41:56] when when he was a mediator,
[1:41:59] it was a messy seat.
[1:42:03] It was coming or coming
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; right and when he stood up
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; with a book
[1:42:13] now he's changing now a throne now and
[1:42:17] changing a seat now
[1:42:20] he's sitting now on a judgment seat
[1:42:25] now he's got a book and in that book
[1:42:30] is the lamb's book of life.
[1:42:34] All those
[1:42:37] that are found in that book
[1:42:41] will be called.
[1:42:43] Look, the Bible says,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; if you read, I think it's Revelation 2:1
[1:42:50] 17,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; it speaks about
[1:42:55] uh he that overcome.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; He said, I will make him eat
[1:43:03] a hidden man.
[1:43:07] Right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] And I will give him a stone
[1:43:12] which is a white stone
[1:43:15] and his name written in that stone
[1:43:19] and he will be the only one
[1:43:22] that knows about it.
[1:43:25] You will be the only one
[1:43:28] that knows about yourself.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] If you are wrong,
[1:43:37] you will know that you are wrong.
[1:43:40] If you are right,
[1:43:42] you will never be disturbed.
[1:43:44] You will continue.
[1:43:47] If you are filthy,
[1:43:49] there's nothing that you can do.
[1:43:52] Whatever you will try to do
[1:43:55] will portray who you are.
[1:44:00] Right? And if you are holy,
[1:44:03] whatever you're trying to do
[1:44:06] will portray who you are.
[1:44:10] Right?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; So then we are given these promises
[1:44:17] that now
[1:44:19] by these we might be partakers of the
[1:44:22] divine
[1:44:25] nature.
[1:44:27] Right?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now in order that you should be
[1:44:31] transformed,
[1:44:34] you must have a testimony.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That's why we read that without
[1:44:41] faith it is impossible
[1:44:47] to please him.
[1:44:51] Right? Amen. I want to read a quote here
[1:44:58] from this book communion
[1:45:01] in paragraph 49.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 49.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says
[1:45:08] there was another William Brenham
[1:45:14] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:45:20] from the genes of God.
[1:45:26] the word of God that was placed in
[1:45:28] there.
[1:45:32] Each one of you
[1:45:36] can think of similar things
[1:45:41] that now
[1:45:43] there was a little spot
[1:45:47] of eternal life
[1:45:50] down there
[1:45:52] from the genes of God.
[1:45:55] He says each one of you
[1:45:59] can think of similar things
[1:46:03] because if you read
[1:46:07] Romans 8,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; if you read verse 29 verse 29,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; read it my brother
[1:46:17] because we are doing what we are
[1:46:24] Right.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; You've got it. Uh uh
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 29
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; vers 29.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; For whom he did for know he also did
[1:46:36] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:46:39] image of his son that he might be the
[1:46:42] firstborn among many brethren.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] Right. Now it says for whom he did for
[1:46:48] no.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; For no is God perfect knowledge.
[1:47:02] Uh God's perfect knowledge.
[1:47:09] God has got a knowledge
[1:47:12] and the knowledge is perfect.
[1:47:16] That is why now he says
[1:47:19] for whom he did for no
[1:47:24] also predestinated
[1:47:29] to be conformed.
[1:47:33] To be conformed
[1:47:36] is to behave according to the standard.
[1:47:45] uh the behavior
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; that are expected
[1:47:53] we are conformed
[1:47:56] that's why we are talking about
[1:47:59] the quickening
[1:48:02] and then uh while we are speaking about
[1:48:04] the quickening spirit
[1:48:07] we're talking about the testimony that
[1:48:11] please God
[1:48:14] and those those testimony that please
[1:48:16] God
[1:48:18] must be confirmed.
[1:48:21] We have to behave according to the
[1:48:23] standard
[1:48:27] and that standard is our promises
[1:48:31] and then those promises are divine.
[1:48:36] God when he look at you,
[1:48:39] he look at you from a a divine mirror.
[1:48:47] You need to be conformed
[1:48:50] according to that standard,
[1:48:54] the divine mirror.
[1:48:58] Are we are we together? So then
[1:49:03] in encouraging you
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; while you are uh waiting for the rapture
[1:49:14] remember that rapture is not a period.
[1:49:19] It's a twinkling of an eye.
[1:49:23] Rapture is not a period.
[1:49:28] You can not say rapture will start here
[1:49:30] and end.
[1:49:33] It's in a twinkle of an eye.
[1:49:37] Once it happened, you cannot straighten
[1:49:40] yourself up.
[1:49:43] So now they are a method,
[1:49:47] a behavior.
[1:49:51] Amen,
[1:49:52] and the standard
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; that will conform you.
[1:49:59] Amen. Then in the book of terminology
[1:50:03] in paragraph 27, paragraph 27, whilst we
[1:50:08] are still under quickening spirit,
[1:50:14] while we are still talking about being
[1:50:17] partakers of divine nature,
[1:50:22] while we are still talking about the
[1:50:24] precious great
[1:50:27] promises,
[1:50:31] exceeding,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; precious,
[1:50:35] great promises.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It's not just a a an ordinary promise.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Remember to be quickened
[1:50:49] is to make alive
[1:50:52] is to give you a divine
[1:50:56] nature.
[1:50:58] Amen.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Right now in in paragraph 27,
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; listen to what the prophet says.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Says,
[1:51:08] "But your souls were made up before the
[1:51:11] foundation of the world.
[1:51:17] Are we together? Your souls."
[1:51:20] That's why when I started here,
[1:51:24] I said, "You are the souls. Right.
[1:51:29] Amen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Being the souls
[1:51:33] ours
[1:51:34] is to give you scriptures
[1:51:37] to give you encouraging words.
[1:51:40] The one that doesn't want those things.
[1:51:44] You don't feed him
[1:51:49] with our own ideas.
[1:51:52] I was a preacher on the trains.
[1:51:56] training with the brother
[1:52:00] in the buses
[1:52:03] and things like that.
[1:52:06] And when it was my turn to preach,
[1:52:10] I was preaching like I'm preaching right
[1:52:11] now.
[1:52:13] Then brother Mia said to me,
[1:52:17] "You won't get even a single soul.
[1:52:20] You must tell them
[1:52:23] yeah their wrongs.
[1:52:26] Then I realized there that not I'm not
[1:52:28] an evangelist.
[1:52:32] Their language
[1:52:34] is not my language. Their way of doing
[1:52:37] things
[1:52:39] is not the way of doing.
[1:52:41] They will do that and people will just
[1:52:44] repent
[1:52:46] and be baptized.
[1:52:48] So but they'll be taken to the pastor
[1:52:52] and the pastor will conform them
[1:52:57] will talk nicely to them are we
[1:53:00] together. That is why even today
[1:53:04] they are still here
[1:53:06] because it says your your soul
[1:53:11] was made up before the foundation of the
[1:53:13] world.
[1:53:16] God created man in his own.
[1:53:20] You must remember,
[1:53:22] we have read that he for know you, for
[1:53:27] knew you
[1:53:30] and predestinated you
[1:53:33] and to be conformed,
[1:53:37] right? Amen. And then you bypass a
[1:53:39] certain stage in your life.
[1:53:45] Now he's reminding you
[1:53:48] about what you are uh what you have
[1:53:50] bypassed.
[1:53:52] And when you hear that
[1:53:55] you long to go home
[1:53:59] and you start follow up the Ruth
[1:54:02] and when you follow up the Ruth
[1:54:05] is why it says Enoch
[1:54:08] pleased God.
[1:54:11] the testimony that he had.
[1:54:15] He heard
[1:54:17] the word of God
[1:54:19] and realized
[1:54:21] that he was wrong and he follow a right
[1:54:25] path.
[1:54:27] You follow the right
[1:54:30] route.
[1:54:32] Are we together?
[1:54:35] Your souls
[1:54:38] are made before the foundation of the
[1:54:40] world.
[1:54:42] When God created man in his own,
[1:54:47] how are we together
[1:54:49] on the same book?
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Uh I I don't have the
[1:54:56] paragraph. It's just a page. Oh,
[1:54:58] paragraph 34. That's paragraph.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Your souls were made up before the
[1:55:03] foundation of the world.
[1:55:08] I I realize I treat the people that's
[1:55:12] brother
[1:55:15] says when I treat the people
[1:55:22] I realize that their souls were made
[1:55:25] before the foundation.
[1:55:29] So when I'm treating them,
[1:55:33] when I'm treating I'm treating God
[1:55:38] says when he's treating you
[1:55:42] because your souls
[1:55:44] were made before the foundation of God,
[1:55:48] he knows that he's treating God.
[1:55:55] But just my attitude towards you
[1:56:00] is my attitude towards Christ
[1:56:06] and your attitudes toward me
[1:56:11] is the same thing. That's right.
[1:56:18] Are we together?
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I will just quote some other scriptures
[1:56:24] in my sermon.
[1:56:27] All my sermons,
[1:56:30] I always quote this scripture.
[1:56:33] I love it. John 6:63,
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; you know it. You don't have to open it.
[1:56:40] It says, "It is the spirit that
[1:56:43] quickenth."
[1:56:46] The flesh profitth nothing.
[1:56:50] The words that I speak unto you,
[1:56:54] that is Jesus Christ. The words that I
[1:56:59] speak unto you,
[1:57:01] they are spirit
[1:57:03] and they are life. The words
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; are spirit
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; and they are alive.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; When you listen and then in in Isaiah
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I think it's 55. Isaiah 55
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; verse 11
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; verse 11
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; he says
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; when my word
[1:57:23] come out of my mouth
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; will never return void
[1:57:31] it will accomplish
[1:57:34] are we together amen now the
[1:57:36] accomplishment
[1:57:40] is to build the germinated the
[1:57:43] germinating person
[1:57:47] the the the men of the wheat,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; And then the accomplishment
[1:57:55] when it come back,
[1:57:58] it has accomplished,
[1:58:01] it finds a place in a person
[1:58:05] and then because it's life,
[1:58:10] it gives that person life.
[1:58:13] That's why the Bible says
[1:58:15] I think it's proverb 8.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 8 and on verse 35 verse 35
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; said he that found me
[1:58:25] has found life
[1:58:28] because the word that I speak
[1:58:32] it is a spirit. We will go to that one.
[1:58:36] The word that I speak is a spirit
[1:58:40] and it is life.
[1:58:43] Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Now, if you read uh
[1:58:51] a quote here,
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; I think it's uh let me get the book.
[1:58:58] Show us the father.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; And it suffices us.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Then he says here,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; uh no. Yes. Yes. Let me start right on
[1:59:14] top.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Let start on top there. It says, let me
[1:59:20] start paragraph 40.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; 40.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Now let's take secondly quickly as we
[1:59:27] can get to it.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; God in his word
[1:59:32] says how many believe God
[1:59:35] God's in the universe.
[1:59:40] And then he said, "All right.
[1:59:42] You can see him in his universe.
[1:59:47] Let's
[1:59:49] let's see if he is in his weight.
[1:59:56] Then what I trust now with all my heart
[2:00:01] that God will quicken
[2:00:06] quicken. The word quicken now by his
[2:00:09] spirit.
[2:00:12] That's what he says. Then he he he gives
[2:00:16] an example
[2:00:18] about the swer that went out. So
[2:00:22] and then he explain it on and on on
[2:00:26] it. That is why in the book of
[2:00:29] Corinthians
[2:00:31] Bible says we should examine ourself
[2:00:36] to see whether we are of faith.
[2:00:42] Are we of faith? We believe the word of
[2:00:45] God as it is
[2:00:49] now. Amen.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; And then you prove yourself
[2:00:54] whether you've got a rapturing faith in
[2:00:57] you.
[2:01:02] Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Right. It continually said, "Know you
[2:01:05] not your own selves.
[2:01:09] that how that Jesus Christ is in you
[2:01:15] except ye repro reproate.
[2:01:19] He says, "Do you know
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is in you
[2:01:26] if Jesus Christ is in you?
[2:01:29] Will you behave the way you behave?"
[2:01:35] That's why he says you examine yourself
[2:01:40] because the Bible says we walk by faith
[2:01:45] not by sight.
[2:01:48] Right? Amen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; We are
[2:01:52] people that are on a journey
[2:01:57] going somewhere
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; and then we are preparing ourselves.
[2:02:03] Then he says, "If you continue,
[2:02:06] I'm reading Colossians now 1:23.
[2:02:11] If you continue
[2:02:13] in the faith
[2:02:16] grounded,
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; settled
[2:02:20] and be not move away from the hope of
[2:02:23] the gospel."
[2:02:29] Now he goes on and state the the seven
[2:02:31] virtues.
[2:02:34] You know the seven virtues.
[2:02:36] faith,
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; virtue,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; knowledge,
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; temperance,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; patience,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; godliness,
[2:02:48] brotherly kindness,
[2:02:53] are you in that root
[2:02:56] or there come times
[2:02:59] where you lose you lose your temper
[2:03:05] Then where do you put that part your
[2:03:09] temperance?
[2:03:15] That is why he says he forneew us.
[2:03:21] He knows who will go through that part.
[2:03:26] It's not you that can control yourself.
[2:03:31] You just surrender
[2:03:33] and then the promises are are precious
[2:03:39] then he is the one that will guide you
[2:03:43] through all
[2:03:47] right.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; So there is a hope of gospel.
[2:03:54] Yeah. The Bible speaks about you being
[2:03:57] rooted,
[2:04:00] build up in him.
[2:04:04] So if you are rooted
[2:04:07] and build up in him, nobody will uproot
[2:04:10] you.
[2:04:12] Nobody will take what is yours.
[2:04:19] If you are believer,
[2:04:22] you are believer eternally.
[2:04:25] You will live the word of God eternally.
[2:04:29] That very tree of life
[2:04:33] that Eve disbelieved,
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; you will get it in New Jerusalem.
[2:04:41] If you don't believe it there, then how
[2:04:43] are you going to believe it?
[2:04:46] That tree is the way.
[2:04:50] Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. Fine. So now nobody will uproot
[2:04:56] you
[2:04:58] because you are stable
[2:05:02] in the faith.
[2:05:04] And it goes on in the book of Timothy,
[2:05:06] it speaks about good conscience
[2:05:12] concerning
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; faith
[2:05:17] that have made. So he says now you you
[2:05:20] don't have to make a shipwreck. You know
[2:05:22] what is a shipwreck?
[2:05:25] is to uh reject biblical truth.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have the Bible says you must
[2:05:36] have a good conscience or your
[2:05:38] conscience
[2:05:42] must condemn you
[2:05:45] to be able to follow God's guidance.
[2:05:52] Amen.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; The power of decision that is a spoken
[2:05:57] word.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 88.
[2:06:03] He says here,
[2:06:06] "Heavenly Father,
[2:06:10] I bless this my brother
[2:06:15] and ask the glory of God of God
[2:06:20] that raised Jesus from the grave.
[2:06:23] The great quickening spirit."
[2:06:29] You say what he says. He says the great
[2:06:32] quickening spirit
[2:06:37] who stand here
[2:06:40] in a form of light
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; bending down with within my soul.
[2:06:50] Yeah. Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Then here he says
[2:06:54] this book
[2:06:58] I'll I'll get there. what you call the
[2:07:01] it's redemption by judgment.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; It says friends,
[2:07:07] people who have those minds
[2:07:10] that are receptable
[2:07:14] uh that
[2:07:16] sorry let me start. See what what it is
[2:07:20] friends.
[2:07:22] People who has those minds
[2:07:26] receptacles
[2:07:29] to isms.
[2:07:36] The first thing you know
[2:07:39] they got a spirit of delusion
[2:07:43] and go all
[2:07:47] and believe in error.
[2:07:51] And then he says don't do that
[2:07:55] be solid
[2:07:59] be stable
[2:08:01] unmovable
[2:08:03] abounding in Christ.
[2:08:07] Otherwise
[2:08:09] you'll cross a separating line
[2:08:14] there is a separating line.
[2:08:16] Then once you cross the separating line
[2:08:20] it will be difficult
[2:08:22] to come back.
[2:08:26] When Abraham met him
[2:08:29] he was meedced
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; to Abraham
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; he was king. Abraham Abraham
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; is the citizen of Salem.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Being the citizen,
[2:08:41] you're the king of the sea.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Then he unfolded what all the attributes
[2:08:49] will do in the end.
[2:08:56] All the attributes
[2:08:58] at the end
[2:09:00] because you are the seed of Abraham.
[2:09:03] Abra. If you receive of Abraham
[2:09:06] then all
[2:09:08] you will do exactly like your father.
[2:09:15] How did your what did your father do?
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Your father recognized him
[2:09:22] as the king.
[2:09:25] Right. Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; And then what did
[2:09:30] Melisedc do?
[2:09:33] recognize him as an attribute
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; because Abraham
[2:09:40] was in mec.
[2:09:43] Amen.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; So he saw that this is my
[2:09:48] attribute
[2:09:51] and Abraham
[2:09:54] recognize him
[2:09:56] as the king.
[2:09:58] That is our duty. Amen.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Then he unfolded what all the attributes
[2:10:07] will do in the end.
[2:10:14] That is why the prophet said
[2:10:20] have you met me?
[2:10:24] That is the attribute at the end
[2:10:28] doing exactly what what our father
[2:10:35] when any attribute of God meets him
[2:10:40] he will appear as God to him. Amen.
[2:10:49] Amen. Now if you read in the book of
[2:10:52] Hebrews
[2:10:54] Uh, chapter six. No, no, no, no, not not
[2:10:57] the Bible. The book, the spoken word.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; That was preached 1957.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Chapter 6.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Chapter 6.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; In paragraphs 634, listen to what he
[2:11:07] says.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; He says, Abraham recognized him
[2:11:15] because
[2:11:16] inside of his veil was an anchor.
[2:11:24] Inside of his vein
[2:11:28] was an anchor
[2:11:31] holding that promise
[2:11:36] in Abraham
[2:11:38] was an anchor
[2:11:41] that hold that promise.
[2:11:46] Abraham himself,
[2:11:49] he had that thing
[2:11:52] like the Samaran woman.
[2:11:54] He had that thing and when he met him,
[2:11:59] that anchor started vibrating.
[2:12:04] This man
[2:12:06] is the one that is in me.
[2:12:10] And what was in God
[2:12:12] started vibrating.
[2:12:15] This is my son.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says he is a rock.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; And then he says now don't turn your
[2:12:27] back away.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; From that rock
[2:12:36] because there is a a coordination
[2:12:41] between you and that rock.
[2:12:44] When you meet that rock, you will know
[2:12:47] that you are a stone.
[2:12:51] He didn't preach to Peter.
[2:12:54] He just said follow me.
[2:12:57] Right. Amen. There was a coordination
[2:13:01] all his disciples.
[2:13:05] There was there was no way that he
[2:13:07] testified unto them.
[2:13:10] He was a magnet. He just called them.
[2:13:15] Some will be praying somewhere
[2:13:18] but the magnet will pull you.
[2:13:22] Now if we come from him,
[2:13:26] we will go back to him.
[2:13:29] And if we don't come from him,
[2:13:33] we will never go back.
[2:13:35] We can pray,
[2:13:37] we can fast, we can read.
[2:13:41] You know the Bible says
[2:13:44] the brother of Jacob,
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; he prayed until he
[2:13:54] looking for repentance,
[2:13:58] but he couldn't.
[2:14:01] And when you preach to the people,
[2:14:05] you don't force them.
[2:14:08] You just bring it in
[2:14:10] individually. They'll grab what is
[2:14:12] theirs.
[2:14:15] They will grab what is theirs. They come
[2:14:18] from God,
[2:14:20] they'll go back to God.
[2:14:22] Are we together? You just uh uh spread
[2:14:26] the seed
[2:14:28] and those that have crossed the
[2:14:30] separation
[2:14:33] there's nothing there's nothing that
[2:14:34] they can do.
[2:14:37] So he says Abraham
[2:14:39] inside
[2:14:41] of his way
[2:14:44] was an anchor
[2:14:47] it holds that promise.
[2:14:51] Not because he had some sensation. Amen.
[2:14:57] But God made him the promise.
[2:15:03] God made him the promise.
[2:15:07] and when he come into contact with that
[2:15:11] that great magnet
[2:15:14] he knew
[2:15:16] it was that flesh
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:15:24] now the Bible
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; has given us some promises
[2:15:31] some things
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; that we will recognize
[2:15:36] The prophet here speaks about three
[2:15:38] elements.
[2:15:42] Uh in this book, the ark
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; he says here
[2:15:50] there are three elements that people
[2:15:52] live in.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; First
[2:15:58] the humanistic.
[2:16:02] Second, the divine revelation
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; and the third is a vision.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; It continues.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Now this
[2:16:16] like in prayer
[2:16:18] when you pray for anyone
[2:16:21] inhumanistic
[2:16:24] we say
[2:16:26] will I hope he'll get well.
[2:16:31] I'm hoping and I'm believing
[2:16:34] which you trying to use all the faith.
[2:16:39] When you pray for somebody,
[2:16:42] you just say I hope my prayer
[2:16:47] has reached God. God will heal him. Then
[2:16:50] he says that that is humanistic.
[2:16:54] And the second one he says is a divine
[2:16:57] revelation.
[2:16:59] When something is revealed to you,
[2:17:04] you just know in your heart, it's going
[2:17:07] to happen.
[2:17:10] Yet there's nothing
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; but just the revelation.
[2:17:15] He says if you can say to that mountain
[2:17:19] must move
[2:17:21] and only a grain move
[2:17:26] know that it will move. We know that it
[2:17:28] is moving
[2:17:31] because grain move.
[2:17:35] So that's a divine revelation. And then
[2:17:38] we said there's a third one which is a
[2:17:40] vision
[2:17:42] that is thus said the Lord
[2:17:46] that's perfectly positive.
[2:17:51] Right. Amen.
[2:17:54] H then he continues then
[2:17:58] okay let me say to you
[2:18:00] there are some things
[2:18:03] that are happening
[2:18:06] that will tell you
[2:18:09] how far are you
[2:18:11] what is happening
[2:18:14] before the rapture
[2:18:16] the prophet speaks about the squeeze
[2:18:20] there should be a squeeze I just want to
[2:18:23] read you something here
[2:18:26] uh
[2:18:27] of what is happening.
[2:18:31] Look, you have to take what the
[2:18:33] scripture says
[2:18:36] and check what is happening around you
[2:18:41] and check the behavior of the people
[2:18:45] and check the behavior of the government
[2:18:49] and check the behavior of the different
[2:18:51] countries.
[2:18:54] and go back to the scripture.
[2:18:57] Then it will tell you,
[2:18:59] go to the promises
[2:19:02] and check this thing according to the
[2:19:04] promise
[2:19:06] and see if it's not like that.
[2:19:11] Right?
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:15] You know our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:19:19] after he had a Lord's supper with his
[2:19:21] disciples,
[2:19:27] I will take no more of the fruit of the
[2:19:30] vine.
[2:19:35] Right? Amen.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Now let's do it like this.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; The the the the the prophet
[2:19:42] promised us that there will be a squeeze
[2:19:47] right
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; what is happening now I I'll go and read
[2:19:51] that quote
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; but I I want to say to you
[2:19:56] uh there's this thing that is happening
[2:20:01] that is doing by all the countries
[2:20:05] I will concentrate only on our own uh h
[2:20:11] country.
[2:20:13] There's some things that are very good
[2:20:17] that the country is doing
[2:20:19] but these things are eye openers to you
[2:20:22] the message believers
[2:20:26] that you should know where you are.
[2:20:30] Okay. The prophet speaks about the temp
[2:20:35] squeeze.
[2:20:37] This code you all know you have it.
[2:20:41] But I'll read it again.
[2:20:44] He says the hour of temptation.
[2:20:48] He's speaking about that
[2:20:51] in the book of Phil Philadelphiaian
[2:20:54] churches. You know about it. He says, "I
[2:20:58] also will keep thee from the hour of
[2:21:00] temptation."
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Sorry. I also will keep thee
[2:21:07] from the hour of temptation.
[2:21:11] who shall come upon all the world
[2:21:16] to try them that dwell upon the earth.
[2:21:21] Then he explains
[2:21:23] this verse is not a declaration that the
[2:21:27] true church will go in into and through
[2:21:30] tribulation.
[2:21:36] It mean that
[2:21:39] if if it means that
[2:21:42] it would have said that but it says I
[2:21:46] will keep thee
[2:21:48] from the hour of temptation.
[2:21:54] He say now this temptation
[2:21:57] is exactly
[2:22:00] like the temptation
[2:22:03] in Eden. It's exactly
[2:22:08] like the temptation
[2:22:10] in Eden.
[2:22:12] What was the temptation
[2:22:17] is that God
[2:22:19] gave Adam and Eve his way.
[2:22:24] They didn't have faith in that word,
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it
[2:22:33] because he said, "If you eat on that
[2:22:36] tree,
[2:22:38] you will die." Somebody came and says
[2:22:42] you will not die. Now they started
[2:22:44] weighing the
[2:22:46] God said you will die. The other one say
[2:22:49] you will not die.
[2:22:50] They took
[2:22:53] then he said
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; God gave Adam
[2:22:58] a bride.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; But before
[2:23:04] he could marry that bride because he
[2:23:07] said multiply
[2:23:10] and and replenish their before he could
[2:23:13] multiply
[2:23:16] rejected the word of God.
[2:23:18] Then he said now he raised the second
[2:23:21] Adam
[2:23:23] which is our Lord Jesus
[2:23:26] and then he came with a promise of
[2:23:29] but before he could marry
[2:23:32] that so-called bride
[2:23:36] then was already mixed up with dogmas
[2:23:39] and things like that.
[2:23:42] That is why now God raised you.
[2:23:47] He said the little group
[2:23:50] that I will marry this
[2:23:54] that I'm going to marry.
[2:23:56] Not even a single one
[2:24:00] will miss it.
[2:24:02] That's what he says. You don't have to
[2:24:05] struggle.
[2:24:07] If you're going to miss it,
[2:24:09] you're not part of it.
[2:24:12] Right. Amen. But to be part of it
[2:24:16] is to be in line like Enoch.
[2:24:21] Then it says now the temptation is is
[2:24:25] like the temptation in Eden
[2:24:30] it will be a very inviting
[2:24:34] proposition
[2:24:38] held up in direct opposition God's
[2:24:41] commandment.
[2:24:46] inviting proposition
[2:24:49] that will be
[2:24:52] in direct opposite
[2:24:55] to God's commandment.
[2:24:58] And yet from the standpoint of human
[2:25:02] reason,
[2:25:03] it will be so very right,
[2:25:07] so enlightening,
[2:25:10] lifegiving
[2:25:11] as to fool the world.
[2:25:16] Only the very elect will not be fooled.
[2:25:22] Amen.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Then he comes now and says
[2:25:26] the temptation
[2:25:29] will come as follows.
[2:25:32] Now he speaks about the acumenical move
[2:25:38] that has started on what seems to be a
[2:25:41] beautiful and blessed principle.
[2:25:47] I will explain that
[2:25:51] uh fulfilling Christ's prayer
[2:25:56] that we might be one.
[2:25:59] It
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; it will become so strong
[2:26:03] politically
[2:26:05] that she bears pressure upon the
[2:26:07] government
[2:26:12] to cause all to join with her.
[2:26:18] through adherence
[2:26:22] to the principles
[2:26:24] enacted into law.
[2:26:30] I won't read it all but what I want to
[2:26:33] show you what's happening
[2:26:36] uh is that now
[2:26:39] there is a movement
[2:26:42] from the government
[2:26:44] which is very good
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; the CRL
[2:26:49] I'm sure you know it
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; CRL
[2:26:53] it's a council
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; for regulatory and local
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; commission council
[2:27:02] It it enforce laws.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; It oversee and enforce laws,
[2:27:14] regulations,
[2:27:16] standards in
[2:27:19] a sector.
[2:27:23] It's a good thing that you must not do
[2:27:26] whatever you want.
[2:27:30] But it is so good
[2:27:33] that when it comes now
[2:27:36] to the church is very very strict also.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Firstly there should be one law.
[2:27:48] You must go to school.
[2:27:52] You cannot stand behind the bullpit
[2:27:55] and harass people.
[2:27:58] You go to jail,
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; which people say, "Hallelujah."
[2:28:02] Hallelujah.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; But you go to school,
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; they're going to teach their own
[2:28:10] doctrine
[2:28:12] because they say, "Let us combine
[2:28:15] and do one thing." Because there are
[2:28:18] people that doom people and say instead
[2:28:22] of praying, you spraying with the doom.
[2:28:28] Some make you to eat snakes.
[2:28:32] Some make you to eat grass.
[2:28:35] I don't think that people will allow
[2:28:37] that.
[2:28:39] When the government take a step,
[2:28:41] everybody is going to say hallelujah.
[2:28:46] Some churches
[2:28:48] are fly by night.
[2:28:52] Now they're doing something that is
[2:28:55] good.
[2:28:56] But in some other countries,
[2:28:59] they don't beg you.
[2:29:02] They just tell you that like in China,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; I was reading here.
[2:29:09] 30 pastors
[2:29:12] are in jail
[2:29:14] who belong to any of the Zionist church.
[2:29:20] All the underground churches are raided
[2:29:24] underground
[2:29:26] in in Nigeria
[2:29:28] right on northern part of Nigeria
[2:29:32] Nigeria the church are persecuted
[2:29:36] they don't want what they see here in
[2:29:39] South Africa
[2:29:42] so they've started now the government
[2:29:44] you see it's a good thing
[2:29:47] but then when you
[2:29:50] have
[2:29:51] a promise and a guideline.
[2:29:55] You could see that something has
[2:29:57] started.
[2:30:00] It's it's not in full force
[2:30:05] and the prophet says
[2:30:09] what we call a third pull right now
[2:30:13] it's not in full force.
[2:30:17] He said let the squeeze start.
[2:30:21] Then you will know what a third pull is.
[2:30:28] Are we together?
[2:30:32] One day I was speaking with the pastor.
[2:30:36] He said to me, "When last did you hear
[2:30:39] me speaking about the underworld?"
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Underorld?
[2:30:47] We have long defeated.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; He's got no power.
[2:30:55] That's what he said.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; But what I'm trying to show you
[2:31:00] is that now
[2:31:02] before
[2:31:05] we our bodies change,
[2:31:09] uh there will be some things
[2:31:12] that will happen.
[2:31:14] And the prophet says,
[2:31:17] some people
[2:31:19] are going to surrender to to that.
[2:31:23] He he said now it'll become so strong
[2:31:26] politically
[2:31:30] that they bear pressure upon the
[2:31:31] government
[2:31:33] to cause all
[2:31:37] the one that is so strong I'm talking
[2:31:39] about ecumenical council
[2:31:46] that that is become so strong
[2:31:49] politically
[2:31:52] that she's pressure upon the ground
[2:31:56] to cause all
[2:31:59] to join
[2:32:01] with either directly or indirectly
[2:32:08] through adherence to the principle
[2:32:13] to go direct or indirect.
[2:32:18] is not right. Now little group will lose
[2:32:22] characters,
[2:32:26] privileges
[2:32:28] the privilege
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; until they lose property
[2:32:34] and spiritual rights.
[2:32:36] That that's what will happen
[2:32:39] right. Amen. Now
[2:32:42] he continues and say
[2:32:46] h in this book. Okay, let me let me read
[2:32:50] it. It says, "And all the time
[2:32:55] these things are going on,
[2:33:00] the spirit of the living God
[2:33:04] is thriving with flesh,
[2:33:07] trying to get men away from his own
[2:33:10] achievement,
[2:33:14] trying to get man away from his own
[2:33:17] selfish motive.
[2:33:23] own selfish motives
[2:33:27] and objective
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; to plan which God has laid down.
[2:33:36] As long as man works in his own plan,
[2:33:41] he will be a failure.
[2:33:44] Says as long
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; as man
[2:33:48] works according to his plan, he will be
[2:33:52] a failure.
[2:33:54] And a man can only achieve that
[2:34:00] when he comes back
[2:34:02] with the right objective
[2:34:06] and the right motive
[2:34:08] that is according to God's plan.
[2:34:12] Any other foundation
[2:34:16] is a sinking sand.
[2:34:21] because he says
[2:34:24] divine gifts
[2:34:28] are very sacred.
[2:34:32] And remember a me a person could send
[2:34:37] their soul to hell with one.
[2:34:44] If you notice
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; on the platform
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; on my cases
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; on my cases
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; my patience
[2:34:55] my patience
[2:34:58] no but patience the patience are
[2:35:02] yes amen I'm very careful
[2:35:07] of what I say let me read it again
[2:35:11] divine gifts
[2:35:14] are very sacred.
[2:35:18] And remember, a person could send their
[2:35:22] soul to hell with one.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; If you'll notice on the platform, on my
[2:35:33] cases,
[2:35:35] my patient
[2:35:38] very careful of what I say.
[2:35:42] Amen.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; I weigh everywhere.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; I find the condition of that soul.
[2:35:50] Before I'm saying something,
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; he says
[2:35:56] he weigh the condition
[2:35:59] of that soul before he could say.
[2:36:05] Right. Amen.
[2:36:06] Now coming back now in closing
[2:36:12] the right way
[2:36:14] is that now he has given us a promise
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; and when he has given us promises
[2:36:23] we stick to those promises
[2:36:26] because they are divine
[2:36:29] right there some other things
[2:36:33] and these supernatural acts
[2:36:36] is to bring your faith back to him
[2:36:39] quicken.
[2:36:45] It's right quick
[2:36:48] to make it quicken to him
[2:36:52] the supernatural acts
[2:36:55] and to bring your faith
[2:37:00] to him so that it should be quicker.
[2:37:05] But it will have to be something
[2:37:08] to quicken your faith
[2:37:12] bring you up into that place
[2:37:16] to where you can accept it.
[2:37:20] It might take you to a place
[2:37:23] where you can accept it.
[2:37:25] Then it will quicken you.
[2:37:29] He says we can't even have faith for
[2:37:32] divine healing.
[2:37:37] let alone rapturing faith.
[2:37:41] You got to have faith
[2:37:44] that will change
[2:37:47] and quicken this body
[2:37:50] to be taken away.
[2:37:54] So that's what I have for you today.
[2:37:57] May the Lord bless you.
[2:38:09] I always like that song.
[2:38:12] Uh
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; that song.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; I'm now here on earth.
[2:38:23] You can sing for us that song. Lord
[2:38:26] bless you all.
[2:38:28] Amen.
[2:38:34] And I'm God.
[2:38:52] Jehovah
[2:39:00] Sing
[2:39:04] him
[2:39:13] I am
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; now
[2:39:28] over
[2:39:32] how Save him.

[2:41:08] father
[2:41:12] command
[2:41:31] behind.
[2:41:34] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:38] May the Lord richly bless you.
[2:41:44] We are truly blessed.
[2:41:50] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:53] I'm going to ask
[2:41:56] to come forth
[2:41:59] just to say a word of prayer
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; as we will also be preparing for the
[2:42:06] baptismal service.
[2:42:10] Just give us a worshiing team,
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; a worshiing song.

[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; city is
[2:42:59] heaven.

[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; heaven.
[2:43:27] Amen.

[2:43:33] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:43:50] Day by day,
[2:43:53] this life is not regressing.
[2:43:58] You gave me an opportunity to make it to
[2:44:01] the service today.
[2:44:03] Father, fill our hearts with glory.
[2:44:07] Fill our hearts with joy.
[2:44:15] We can never

[2:44:29] church that

[2:44:52] You will always be with us. We know, we
[2:44:55] have seen it. It's not history.
[2:45:01] We thank you, Father.
[2:45:03] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:45:05] pray. Amen.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; You may take your seat.
[2:45:19] Uh my brother just lead us with songs

[2:58:28] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:58:34] Just come forth to say a word of prayer.
[2:58:38] Then after we are going to read the
[2:58:39] scripture for the baptism. God bless
[2:58:42] you.
[2:58:46] Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly
[2:58:49] father, the mighty God, creator of all
[2:58:52] heavens and the earth.
[2:58:54] Father, we come to you this afternoon
[2:58:57] after you have delivered a masterpiece
[2:59:00] after you delivered your word in our
[2:59:02] souls.
[2:59:04] Father, here we are in this baptismal
[2:59:06] service.
[2:59:08] Two young boys have repented, Lord.
[2:59:11] They've heard your word that we are born
[2:59:14] in sin and shape iniquity. We came in
[2:59:17] this world speaking lies. But by your
[2:59:20] grace and mercy, finally Lord, you saw
[2:59:24] what is in their souls and their
[2:59:26] spirits.
[2:59:27] And your word pricked their hearts. They
[2:59:30] took that decision, Lord, to come and be
[2:59:34] baptized. And your word tells us that
[2:59:38] baptismal it shows that we are dying
[2:59:41] with you, Lord. and will raise with you.
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; As our brothers are entering in this
[2:59:48] water, Father and these souls come to
[2:59:52] you today, Father, we are rejoicing in
[2:59:54] our hearts because the Bible says when
[2:59:57] one sinner repents on earth, there is
[3:00:00] joy in heaven. Father, we are coming to
[3:00:03] you with this baptismal service that may
[3:00:07] your word
[3:00:09] find a dwelling place in their hearts as
[3:00:12] they enter in. Lord, you have promised
[3:00:15] that you will come in in their hearts.
[3:00:17] Lord, together with the brothers that
[3:00:20] are taking them in, as John the Baptist
[3:00:22] one day did and Lord, they were saved.
[3:00:25] and all of us Lord being witnesses of
[3:00:29] this great word of God that has conform
[3:00:32] us and change us to your very image.
[3:00:34] Father, we thank you. We ask for thy
[3:00:37] blessings in the mighty name of our Lord
[3:00:40] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:00:50] Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:00:56] Therefore let all the house of Israel
[3:00:58] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:01:00] same Jesus whom ye have crucified both
[3:01:04] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:01:07] this, they were pricked in their heart
[3:01:09] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[3:01:11] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[3:01:14] shall we do?" Then Peter said to them,
[3:01:17] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:01:19] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:01:22] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:01:24] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:01:27] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:01:29] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:01:32] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:01:34] call.
[3:01:55] Fool
[3:02:17] is
[3:02:22] Oh,
[3:02:26] speech speech.
[3:03:05] Oh.
[3:03:34] That's for
[3:03:39] Okay.
[3:04:01] Joy,
[3:04:03] soul.
[3:04:21] Amen.
[3:04:26] Just to come forth for a word of prayer.
[3:04:35] Let let us pray.
[3:04:39] Heavenly Father,
[3:04:42] we'd like to thank you, Lord Almighty,
[3:04:44] for these souls.
[3:04:47] The pastor would always say, "Yes, they
[3:04:50] might look young,
[3:04:52] but their souls are not young."
[3:04:56] Now that Lord Almighty they surrender
[3:04:58] their lives
[3:05:00] unto thee at the very young age.
[3:05:04] We believe with all our hearts Lord
[3:05:06] Almighty
[3:05:08] that you will undertake Lord
[3:05:12] as per promise gracious heavenly father
[3:05:15] like we've just said that
[3:05:18] calling them Lord Almighty from the book
[3:05:22] and you are calling them uh by their
[3:05:24] names
[3:05:26] and they are
[3:05:28] hearing Lord Almighty your voice. Thank
[3:05:32] you father. May you be with them Lord
[3:05:34] and guide them and let them grow Lord
[3:05:37] Almighty until the day when their bodies
[3:05:41] will be quickened Lord. In the name of
[3:05:43] my Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen.
[3:05:52] Amen.

[3:06:07] for us?

[3:06:12] worship team.
[3:06:14] They will also sing a song. Then after
[3:06:17] they will sing a song to release the
[3:06:19] church.
[3:06:20] Just turn to your neighbor and say, "God
[3:06:23] bless you."
