TRANSCRIPT
========================================
watch great mystery of Love expressed that God and Men became one um amen amen now we can stand therefore therefore ages God and Men became one amen um some people as I discovered that the enough once said maybe I can use this name godima one certain kodima thinks that he is god um and I said but and I said um God himself said let us make men in our image amen now if you say somebody is making himself god um it is because you can never hate God when he said let us make men in our image that means if you want to see a genuine man that is in the image who is in the image of God [Applause] let's look at the original things now because it says amen and the whole thing is God and Men let's look at it now is amen that is the whole thing foreign God and Men amen because men is the destination of God [Music] um all right amen you see we we have today some prophets and what was coming in and out now I'm saying is until they they are sailing now what they call the blood of Jesus and all those things we of the Supernatural we are not looking at water oil and all those things because the ministry now is producing the original things the Bible never said in the beginning was water and oil and what if I feel like now it's easy the whole thing is Golden man God and man was one who taken home so if God and man was one in the beginning what do we expect at the end you don't understand Amen in the beginning was the word it has to end up as the wage amen otherwise it hasn't reached the destination it is still in the processary amen amen amen and person if if you preach the message we were in the denominations then they say and he took the book from the one set on the throne [Music] you took the book from the one only also on the throne um amen amen hallelujah hallelujah that's not it's not there's no message there amen after he took the book what happened the ministry the message can't just say he took the book from the one who sat on the throne and then amen after that they call for prayer life received their message amen they end up we've been prayed foreign whatever it's much on prayer life because out of that they can make Fame they can get famous and the money amen amen prayer line ends up as a business all right brother Branham also prayed for the people no brother but what was supernaturally your book perfect faith perfect face perfect it says if you have perfect Faith what do you need in the prayer amen and he says oti if you administered don't believe or don't have faith for uh you know you know you know um faith is the Sixth Sense foreign why he can use oil those things were bringing how the prophet speaking about the prayer and oil and Faith okay one was trying to explain to the people also saying um it was by saying that Jesus also used mud at one time 82 years now boost up their thing of selling a whale what and what else is now now I said in in Swaziland that they again when I was talking to the people there in a tentative have you ever seen Jesus going around with some bottles of mud maybe labeled an ended matches it was for a certain peoples that the Lord Jesus said to that blind man how um and right ask them also a question If a person comes counters and he is given water they don't they buy this water from the ministers now they always tell you that the pastor prayed for the water now my question is is it the water that is sick or the person um because the Bible say pray for the sick not for the water I am okay let's let's get let's come back here amen God and men who are sworn there and God and Men is one year God cannot change is God in men that's his manifestation manifesting manifestation means God is in I know it's called Brothers wake up a manifestation means God is in a man God was manifested in flesh so God was manifested that that's when God is in a man is a manifestation amen amen amen okay now let's take it from there another thing is no it says God and you come to men okay amen so now the word was made foreign as attributes we were one with God because we were in his mind God I knew you before now this is only the figures which is the ability but we we are not these bodies the man is inside as man was inside of God God is inside of the man he started with God in a man in God now it ends up with God man God in it started with man in God now it's God in a man amen okay amen now we we are trying to pave a way for the seven seal what is the seventh seal now brother Branham says the servant seal if you understand started back there amen in this form I want us to I don't know what is the time I don't trust this watch unless amen okay but let me read one something here because amen you are going to see something you know if you can hear the prophet of God I was even reading it right now before I started for this place but I'm going to make sure that I read it before we we leave this place this is God is behind your skin you know they mystery today in the secret the Deep secret is where God is against amen foreign [Music] spiritual Moya as the Bible says they said is properly identified we know where it is amen we we he says we know amen amen let's get into a serious thing now yeah for the Bible says you you shall know you know the thing is if the people don't know yeah in a very tricky situation but when the wind where there is no knowledge foreign he is he becomes vulnerable to any kind of teaching now because he doesn't amen amen amen amen if a student doesn't know the first man who discovered diamond in diamond in South Africa South Africa is vulnerable because somebody can come in and say it was foreign if she doesn't know [Music] anybody can come and teach anything now Goku has stated okay now here I've got brother brand name here and then he says uh secret that I must I must say much about it is and as he told me in the beginning this is nothing of it so and uh um it speaks for itself why okay amen amen don't say anything it's for it it speaks for itself why amen Hallelujah the Lord Jesus said Peter Peter Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you after Peter he said thou and the Christ son of the Living God because in the name it was an offense to say Jesus is the Christ [Music] talk because and because it was a revelation to say Jesus is the Christo amen so when Peter said Thou Art the Christ Jesus says Flesh and Blood oh yes that means it didn't come through theology is are not taught of any man but it is my father Thou Art blessed because my father spoke through you amen I am the Christ son it speaks for itself [Music] you know listening to somebody speaking make it out whether he is speaking or something is speaking um I don't have the book but let me quote to you another brother says nothing but the truth why this she has said from God this learner she never said this from that from from the from here when she said brother Branham that is the truth God spoke through him foreign [Music] [Music] I am the son of man am the Christ because it must speak for itself amen [Applause] because it was the father who answers amen amen yeah it was God in the sunship now in the cycle unfortunately when he speaks something it comes through is now he himself spoke of himself as the Christ was supposed to be confirmed here you know you God has put you as somebody as a a room he should confirm his word are we together amen you are a person yes not to say anything foreign [Music] my brother amen I will read it in the Bible here what's my Bible I don't know okay amen DJ where's my Bible amen all right amen okay let me read that in the Bible amen what is the time here and what time I should be wrapping up if you can put it on a note because sometimes I forget what a man I I I I I want to use this so to read a bit fast I will let's go to the first book of John John amen now we we are wondering what we we are trying to fight what is the seventh seal this is why why the prophet says God said nothing amen because God is worshiped in seven yeah I said brother masito was there when we were in Gabon in Congo I repeated the same thing that yeah the revelation of the children okay now if you find somebody if you find somebody with this book the revelation of the seventh seals saying to you the servant is not revealed take that book from him tell him to produce his the revelation of six sins because this one is say seven amen food amen then why don't you say that your book says the revelation of the Seven Seals amen amen okay amen with this book in your hand somebody saying to you is not revealed but the book says the revelation of the Seven Seals it so I can't say Amen to somebody saying it is not revealed if it is the number of men not of God you stand out hey six is the number of men seven is the number of God foreign the bride of one talking about the bread group I'm my wife my husband says amen you better take it from the wife um if you want to know about the man daughter ask foreign now if you want to know anything about God you should ask the the bright amen when God the prophet says God was a sin as the seven colors uh-huh no amen and brother Brandon says condescended into logos amen we are coming to the men now the logos is still this seven yeah he says all these seven what's the strongest condescended into because the whole thing one condescended was seven downwards oh you as a man if you are in the image of God because now that's why you can contain seven you alone it will take a Seven Fold container to contain standard six seals container cannot contain seven days are still over this is okay all right now as we've got it like this the logos is the weight it is amen the logos is Christ who Christ amen according to the Prophet non-profit God condescended um God has no beginning but the beginning of the unfolding God a God was me the way it was made Among Us and we saw his glory amen it was made flesh when it was made flesh then we saw his glory amen all right amen now yeah when he opened the seventh time it was all the Bible says silence okay amen now Kobo I I said to a brother if you could catch this I will buy him Coke the first man here I can say let's let's put this one now as Adam the first man then now the prophet says Adam or Adam was not the destination Adam is the spirit that came from God came into Adam the nature station made of foreign Jesus was part of the is it yes it's very important to put it here amen so the Adam this was it the part of the Earth God breath into Adam Breath of Life which was the prophet says this the man Adam Who Came From God God process process is the attribute the attribute and but as he says with Adam my past so the Spirit came into the body so um they became a living souls he bypassed this which is also funny it is logos it's a thing that you can't see foreign to be put in a body he could not die as a theophone he had to come into a body that could die a body that came through a woman um because a man born of a woman has but few days now here we we start with Adam God molded things in heaven now you have here heaven and you have the yes okay amen we're trying to

creature that was the name thereof and God said amen after 2 verse 19 yeah yeah um because God is the god of the universe Adam was the god of the Earth was the other contract the other side of the
