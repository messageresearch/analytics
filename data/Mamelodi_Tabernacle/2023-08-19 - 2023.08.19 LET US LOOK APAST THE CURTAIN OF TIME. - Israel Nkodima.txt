Description:
Title: Let Us Look Apast The Curtain Of Time
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 19-08-2023 at Gqeberha 

I John 1: 1- 5

The purpose of this sermon was to invite the audience to look Apast the curtain of time.

If you believe you were a theophany it means you came from the seven rainbow colors. If we can see one another as Theophany’s there will be no differences among ourselves.

The Bride of Christ is not made of quotations but is the life. God preaches a revelation to the revelation in the form of a man.

When Christ speaks to you he speaks to the word that came from him. 

The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

57-1006Questions and answers on Hebrews #3 Par 822 - 824
60-0911M As I Was With Moses...Par 143 - 145
63-0302E The Seventh Seal Par 78, 64, 393

answers I don't know in this um a page of mine here is 4.99.99 and paragraph important I will take the paragraph from 8 22 to 8 22 we have read this even recently yes and the prophet speaking here do you remember it God was this great big Fountain of sir seven colors and you know he calls it uh these seven colors and he says eating uh God was this great big function of seven colors [Music] how many knows that he says and how many knows that God has seven spirits that is in the Bible absolutely seven spirits and there were seven eyes but uh what makes it so important to us and he says so so forth all that who's coming together all right yeah amen amen and that's why hello we don't call him today seven spirits because he says all that things coming now together now uh you are a is coming together when [Music] uh it has come together it will be called I'm looking here you know when you are looking at that that's a man too and the Lord God also go through as it says it he was the seven colors of the rainbow but now today is coming together now a mere a man cannot see him in that form um [Music] um became [Music] [Applause] [Music] all this is coming together how he dwelt in there in the man I am doing and they're coming through some Supernatural stages like of the seven colors now we see him today not as seven colors but I'm reading here it says now well well now hold on on to this all that is coming together now this was preached many years ago all right then now if you take the Theo funny okay now when he the logos went out of God which was God coming from this one big Fountain into a body in the form of a man so when he came in this form it was from the Fountain of seven colors it made the logos which we call yes now if you take the fuel that's your funny when you are looking at that that is a man no differences if we could meet as lead ers now because we meet and some are [Music] foreign [Applause] amen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm not preaching to the message that is the bride amen amen because I don't know which mean Ministry or where they made that particular church I know the bride is the word of God that's why I preach the bride the word so if you preach the prize that's why the bride will keep on saying amen amen amen you preach the bride which is the word it is all put together we call it the bride of Christ amen amen and when Christ speaks to you he speaks to the word that came from him that's why the the word he has spoken cannot deny him God spoke you into existence you exist because he exists [Applause] amen amen he has made you a revelation I am so he has formed you and they made you a revelation you can't believe the things you can't believe that you are a revelation unless you are a revelation is the Living God The Living Word of God not a quotation some people are going around with the quotations and they are taking them into different ways what we need is not a quotation that life himself because the Bible says [Applause] he has made us where is that scripture I'll come to that scripture in Hebrews because as the prophet says we are him revealed [Applause] mm-hmm you are the revealed word you can't believe where are you is that right and my brother was telling me that because you know the Lord Jesus asked the disciples who do men say that I the son of man am but okay [Music] [Music] and of course there was a pause until Peter opened his mouth [Music] Chris too so how did Peter know that it is like this woman here I I heard something I was reading here of this woman and the summer written women you know this woman uh I I I I will read this part here about sister [Music] read you from this part foreign with Clinton Moses Moses when the people come together to be prayed for that's what I understand and one absolutely hits the spot you know whose God you come and hit the spot I mean so now if you hit the spot whatever turning down men like Peter you know so they did hit the spot then Wendy Peter hit the spot how Petros were coming down then he said what is what did he say what do you need Christ said to Peter who created foreign [Music] [Applause] then he said upon this road to Allah not upon Peter I hope he's got pets no Upon This Rock yes I will build my church it reminded of that architect we are told that and there's a man who wanted somebody foreign [Music] early they ended up seeing at the center level down you must read the spoken words that they tried some Baza because they were offered many a reward foreign foreign all right behind descent yeah as a builder that one when it's a true story that one went down he also arrived at the scent level now he rejected is it as a foundation the prophet of God says the men knew that is a man so he went deeper he arrived at where the other people could not go first you know just like that even this morning there are some people who cannot find the rock because Christ is the rock that's why I say Rock of Ages some people come but they can't find that they can't arrive at that room if all the people we wouldn't be having some pieces of changes because if we find a rock that is foreign [Music] I mean yeah you know we know even if Satan come to tempt us we know that fears behind this Satan there must be life there is Satan cannot beat me behind him let me hide myself you know a true Christian um will pass all the Temptations He must find a place [Applause] not where you are prayed for every day that's when you come to a place amen amen they call it a resting place [Applause] I mean amen and then from there you don't complain of anything you are not prayed for every day yet still you can't find it come to a solution you know there are people who worship us you cannot come to a spiritual solution they believe in praying and praying and praying doesn't take you to the solution the faith in Christ is the solution [Applause] Sandy where all other peoples I know that yes like who said I know that my redeemer happy oh Joe I know that even death could not threaten me because he knew then that man from the sand now he started to yeah where others have failed me [Applause]

you the story a bridge I was reading then Fonda where the prophet of God said about the Lord Jesus Christ that when he died and you know why he died yes it was not a tragedy he was supposed to die according to his own plan okay he wanted to go down amen amen so that's why he came and when he died the Bible says he went away foreign foreign because he says when he was down there he could he had the other part of okay I mean because men are failed and that's why we have standing in the Gap really yeah uh you'll realize now before we finish and then people don't know the what it means standing in the game they just read about it I don't actually know what it means and somebody tell us standing in the gap for who am I to be because there was again and somebody was supposed to come down forfeited when he left that place he left again because God and Men the first thing you see he says let us make men in our image is a part of the threefold revelation of God now we wanted men [Applause] [Music] since it was in his mind and when Adam forfeited and then God come with the law of redemption to redeem to bring it back again otherwise it will remains they will say God once made a man he failed that man failed again tried to make somebody like him now God [Applause] came with the law of re Ward to bring it back again what I want to do I'm going to do yes if God wanted to make
