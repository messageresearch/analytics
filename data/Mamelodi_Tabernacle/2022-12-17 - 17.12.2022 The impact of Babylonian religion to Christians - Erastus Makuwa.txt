Description:
Title: The impact of Babylonian religion to Christians
Description: This message was preached  by Pastor Erastus Makuwa in  Leeuwfontein at Spoken Word Tabernacle on Saturday 17th December 2022. During the service he read Romans 1 : 16 -25  “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:”
‭‭He read the above scripture and
Zachariah 5:5-11 to teach the Church about the Babylonian religion.

God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness [Music] because that which may be known to God is Manifest in them for God had showed it unto them dead for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world as any sin being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and good hate so that they are
