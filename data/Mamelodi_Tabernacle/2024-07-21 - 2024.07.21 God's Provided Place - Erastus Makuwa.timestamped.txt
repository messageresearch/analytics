[1:10:56] H we are greeting our pastor
[1:10:59] Pastor

[1:11:07] us he's with us even
[1:11:11] now he's with us in the
[1:11:15] service always he's with
[1:11:18] us even if we marriage with us
[1:11:25] and I really thank you for
[1:11:30] that um the scripture we have read
[1:11:37] here and I just want to take this small
[1:11:45] topic you always know I am not a l
[1:11:51] preacher uh uh topic says go provided
[1:12:03] place then it continues saying the
[1:12:06] secret
[1:12:12] place that is what I'm going to try to
[1:12:16] speak
[1:12:22] about it must be a
[1:12:27] place provided by
[1:12:33] God and there must be another
[1:12:37] place a secret
[1:12:42] place here where we have
[1:12:47] read uh Moses was asking
[1:12:52] God was requesting
[1:12:58] that he must show him his
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:04] glory that is what Moses was asking from
[1:13:09] God to see the glory of
[1:13:14] God and we have read another scripture
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] here that scripture
[1:13:22] says is Jesus talking
[1:13:26] yeah he
[1:13:27] said oh
[1:13:30] Father glorify thou
[1:13:34] me with with thy own
[1:13:40] self with the glory which I had with
[1:13:47] thee before the
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:51] world he asking God to glorify him
[1:13:57] with his own
[1:14:00] self and his own
[1:14:02] self is the
[1:14:05] glory
[1:14:08] say that is the
[1:14:10] glory which we have to
[1:14:15] together before the world
[1:14:18] us glorify me father with
[1:14:23] that and it seems as if he something
[1:14:26] that Moses was looking
[1:14:31] for he wanted to see
[1:14:35] that that the
[1:14:37] glory I believe as we go
[1:14:41] on we shall also see that
[1:14:47] Glory but according to the scripture as
[1:14:51] we are
[1:14:53] reading but we shall come
[1:14:57] that um in verse 21 as we have
[1:15:03] read
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:07] um God said answered
[1:15:11] Moses he said uh there is a
[1:15:17] place by
[1:15:20] me come and stand on that place amen
[1:15:28] but when we
[1:15:30] follow we found that that
[1:15:34] place it was a
[1:15:38] rock but the Bible says is a place by
[1:15:46] me and then he said to
[1:15:49] Moses when you are standing on that
[1:15:52] place
[1:15:56] now I'm going to do
[1:15:58] something I'm going to take
[1:16:01] you and put you inside the C of The
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:08] Rock he said that is a secret
[1:16:14] place that's why I said I'm going to
[1:16:16] talk about a private provided place
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:25] by
[1:16:26] God then according to the
[1:16:29] scripture that provided place was a
[1:16:34] rock then there is another place on the
[1:16:41] rock that is a
[1:16:43] CFT but there you don't go
[1:16:48] yourself God must take you and put you
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:56] but what you must
[1:16:58] do because we have got three things that
[1:17:02] we can do
[1:17:06] ourselves is what
[1:17:10] baptism taking
[1:17:12] communion food
[1:17:15] watching those we can do
[1:17:18] ourselves that's why to come to the
[1:17:21] place you can do it yourself
[1:17:26] because God said to
[1:17:28] Moses
[1:17:30] come to the place by
[1:17:34] me the place provided by by
[1:17:38] me but when you are
[1:17:41] there then I will do
[1:17:44] something that's what the Bible
[1:17:47] says if you
[1:17:49] repent and you are
[1:17:52] baptized God will fill you
[1:17:56] he will forgive you your
[1:17:58] sins and he will fill
[1:18:00] you he will take over from
[1:18:04] there when you have done the
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:13] F the first it must be
[1:18:17] you now
[1:18:19] sometimes to see to hear God
[1:18:24] you must come to a certain
[1:18:28] place just like
[1:18:32] Abraham he went to the
[1:18:36] place where he was with were standing
[1:18:39] before
[1:18:42] God then when he stood there to the same
[1:18:47] place he could see Sodom
[1:18:51] Ben he couldn't see Sodom Ben at
[1:18:57] place he had to go to the place where he
[1:19:01] stood before
[1:19:05] God when he stood there he saw
[1:19:10] S I say
[1:19:13] sometimes you must stand on a certain
[1:19:18] place to
[1:19:20] see and if you don't want to stand on
[1:19:22] that place
[1:19:26] you will never
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:29] see but to
[1:19:31] see you must stand on that
[1:19:35] place let me read something
[1:19:39] here The Prophet says
[1:19:44] here he said how many ever seen that
[1:19:47] picture of a cow in the bush
[1:19:57] in the bush he said that you just have
[1:20:01] to look and
[1:20:05] look did you ever seen
[1:20:08] that or seen the picture of Christ in
[1:20:12] the
[1:20:14] bush or in the
[1:20:17] sky or
[1:20:19] clouds see that painter has got that so
[1:20:23] fixed up Sor that
[1:20:29] painter got that so fixed
[1:20:33] up until you have to look at
[1:20:39] it a certain
[1:20:42] way then when you once seen
[1:20:46] it you can't see nothing
[1:20:51] else but
[1:20:53] that it was a picture on a
[1:20:59] billboard on that billboard there was a
[1:21:04] bush and that on in that bush there was
[1:21:07] a picture of a cow
[1:21:10] there and people will pass
[1:21:12] there but not seeing that
[1:21:15] car but seeing the bush and see the
[1:21:19] billboard but to see that
[1:21:22] cow you must
[1:21:25] stand on a certain you must see you must
[1:21:28] look at a certain
[1:21:31] way you must stand on a certain
[1:21:35] place you can't just see it standing
[1:21:39] where you are
[1:21:40] standing you must come to a certain
[1:21:43] place and look a certain
[1:21:46] way but there must be
[1:21:49] someone who has already
[1:21:51] seen he must take you
[1:21:54] put you at that
[1:21:56] place and let you
[1:21:59] s stand like this and look now then you
[1:22:04] will see but if you just come I will see
[1:22:09] where is it they say in that billboard
[1:22:13] you'll see there and come back you say
[1:22:16] there's nothing
[1:22:19] there but to
[1:22:21] see you must go there and you must be
[1:22:24] led by
[1:22:25] somebody and stand on a provided
[1:22:30] place and you will
[1:22:32] see and the prophet says
[1:22:35] here once you have seen
[1:22:40] that once you have seen
[1:22:44] it you will see nothing
[1:22:50] else
[1:22:52] amen he says yeah
[1:22:55] everything else is
[1:22:58] G is
[1:23:01] God that is the way Christ
[1:23:06] is himself the gospel and the message
[1:23:11] is words in other words you say that is
[1:23:14] how that is the way Christ
[1:23:18] is that is where the message
[1:23:21] is that is where the gospel is
[1:23:29] and that is where the message of the
[1:23:31] hour
[1:23:34] is once you see the message of the
[1:23:39] hour there is nothing else you can
[1:23:45] see hallelujah

[1:24:09] it amen but if you are not
[1:24:13] shown even if you can look like this you
[1:24:17] will see
[1:24:20] nothing once you have seen the message

[1:24:56] there and they see
[1:25:02] nothing they're just they are just with
[1:25:07] us they're just accompanying
[1:25:13] us but once you have seen the
[1:25:20] message that's all

[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:37] message when Noah and his group has seen

[1:26:39] to
[1:26:47] happen also to
[1:26:51] Worship You must have to come to a
[1:26:53] certain
[1:26:57] place the prophet also says like said
[1:27:01] like
[1:27:02] that to
[1:27:05] Worship You must come to a certain
[1:27:10] place you can't just worship
[1:27:17] anywhere if you want if you are a true
[1:27:22] worshiper you must look for a place of
[1:27:29] worship where God
[1:27:33] is and you you won't stop until you
[1:27:36] reach that
[1:27:39] place he says there is something about
[1:27:42] where you
[1:27:47] go what church you go
[1:27:50] to what teacher teaches you
[1:27:55] do you know
[1:27:56] that he got something to
[1:27:59] eat therefore we ought to seek out the
[1:28:03] very best that we can
[1:28:09] find so we are getting the
[1:28:13] best not because it is
[1:28:19] sociable so for but the real Bible
[1:28:23] teaching
[1:28:26] in other to
[1:28:28] you you are blessed
[1:28:31] people that is what the prophet is
[1:28:33] saying here because the prophet here is
[1:28:36] addressing
[1:28:38] you he says you so we are getting the
[1:28:47] best not because it is
[1:28:51] sociable or so forth but the real bible
[1:28:58] teach that is what we are getting
[1:29:04] here you can't get it
[1:29:08] anywhere it is something
[1:29:11] real you have to be sure about the place
[1:29:14] you go to
[1:29:18] worship because there is only one place
[1:29:21] where God can meet a worshiper at
[1:29:27] even wanted to go to that
[1:29:31] place where God always is
[1:29:38] there then he said if I can go to his
[1:29:43] house and knock at his
[1:29:47] door that is the wish of
[1:29:51] sh I think it is the wish it is your
[1:29:54] wish
[1:29:56] also he says
[1:29:59] here the thing I want to speak about
[1:30:02] this
[1:30:04] morning is that God has only one
[1:30:08] place that the worshiper can meet
[1:30:13] God only one place Through the
[1:30:18] Ages many has sought to has sought for
[1:30:22] that secret place of
[1:30:27] God through all
[1:30:29] ages that's why he said to Moses come to
[1:30:33] a place by
[1:30:35] me but now if you are there I will take
[1:30:39] to my
[1:30:44] secret you can't get
[1:30:47] there if you can just
[1:30:49] come my private my provided place
[1:30:54] then I will take you there he says
[1:30:56] through
[1:30:59] ages many has sought for that secret
[1:31:03] place of
[1:31:06] God through all
[1:31:10] ages even job wanted to know where he
[1:31:13] lived
[1:31:16] at if I could only go to his
[1:31:20] house and knock at his door
[1:31:24] job wanted to find gospel in
[1:31:28] place because God and his
[1:31:32] family is worshiped
[1:31:35] there the family of God in
[1:31:38] heaven and the family of God on
[1:31:41] Earth is named

[1:31:47] Christ job wanted to find that
[1:31:51] place because where go
[1:31:54] is his family is
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:31:59] there he's always
[1:32:02] present where his family
[1:32:04] is the heaven heaven is always
[1:32:08] there where God is where his family is
[1:32:13] Heaven Is there that's what the prophet
[1:32:15] says before you come to this
[1:32:18] service before you come to this God
[1:32:21] sends his angels first there
[1:32:26] if you have
[1:32:28] got will come and wait for
[1:32:32] you it will wait for you at your
[1:32:37] seat and that's why if you are at home
[1:32:41] something is pulling you you want to
[1:32:44] come to
[1:32:45] church because something is waiting for
[1:32:47] you there there is a connection between
[1:32:51] you and with something there
[1:32:54] the word of God is part of you that's
[1:32:58] why where the word of God is you want to
[1:33:01] be
[1:33:03] there because you won't fit to any
[1:33:07] place because the word of God won't be
[1:33:10] there you will be where the word of God
[1:33:23] wanted to
[1:33:25] know where God lived
[1:33:31] at because if you find
[1:33:35] him you find his
[1:33:40] family and if you find
[1:33:43] this you find
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:48] him his family is where he is
[1:33:59] amen there is a place of
[1:34:06] worship and it is God's provided place
[1:34:09] of
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:13] worship he could only meet you in that
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:19] place but when we go back when we go
[1:34:24] back to where we
[1:34:26] were where we
[1:34:29] AF when we read verse 21
[1:34:34] there the Lord
[1:34:36] said behold there is a place by
[1:34:41] me thou shall stand upon
[1:34:47] their is a is a provided
[1:34:51] place and we have said that is a roong
[1:34:56] and there was a secret place
[1:35:01] there and that secret place was the left
[1:35:04] of the
[1:35:08] Rock and the Bible says
[1:35:11] here you can't place yourself
[1:35:18] there he says when you have
[1:35:22] come to that
[1:35:25] place you'll see my
[1:35:28] glory because I will take you and put
[1:35:31] you in the
[1:35:35] C when I
[1:35:37] pass you see
[1:35:43] my in theft of the
[1:35:46] Rock in the secret
[1:35:49] place you don't get there
[1:35:52] yourself God had to pull
[1:35:57] you the Bible says
[1:35:59] so the prophet says
[1:36:02] so you can't go there
[1:36:05] yourself if you
[1:36:07] try people have
[1:36:11] tried but they
[1:36:13] failed some didn't
[1:36:16] try but they've managed to get
[1:36:21] there because it was God pulling them
[1:36:24] into
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:27] that not themselves not their
[1:36:32] person people
[1:36:34] try to call people to
[1:36:38] come but because they are they are not
[1:36:41] called by
[1:36:43] God they won't
[1:36:46] come the prophet says you have got the
[1:36:51] voice you Al
[1:36:54] your
[1:36:57] Li is the
[1:37:00] voice and your voice your life can call
[1:37:05] people without you
[1:37:09] speaking leave the life
[1:37:18] first because some people by
[1:37:22] talking they drive people
[1:37:27] away Jesus
[1:37:29] said no man can come to
[1:37:32] me
[1:37:34] because the rock is
[1:37:37] Christ the Bible says the rock is
[1:37:43] Christ and if you come to the
[1:37:46] rock you come to
[1:37:49] Christ then you cannot
[1:37:52] come if you are not
[1:37:55] pulled he Jesus said
[1:37:58] himself no man can come to
[1:38:01] me except my father thrw him
[1:38:04] first all the father has given
[1:38:07] me will come to me no man can understand
[1:38:12] in who he
[1:38:16] is how it
[1:38:18] is except it is it is revealed to you by
[1:38:23] the re
[1:38:28] here is here we see plainly that God is
[1:38:32] revealed in Jesus
[1:38:37] Christ and only those who are for
[1:38:39] ordained to see
[1:38:43] it they will see it no man can
[1:38:48] come except my father throws him first
[1:38:53] and all the father has given
[1:38:56] me they will come they will recognize
[1:39:02] it and no other man can do
[1:39:07] it no other
[1:39:09] person no matter how
[1:39:13] good how good you
[1:39:16] are to be
[1:39:19] revealed to you then you see who Jesus
[1:39:23] Christ
[1:39:26] is it is revealed to
[1:39:29] you you will see who Jesus Christ
[1:39:33] is now here predestinate that plan in a
[1:39:38] plain
[1:39:41] [Music]
[1:39:43] view just as other
[1:39:46] seat the word of God is a
[1:39:49] seat and it must have a ground prepared

[1:40:00] Grace prepares the heart
[1:40:04] first he prepared you before the
[1:40:06] foundation of the
[1:40:10] world to receive him in this
[1:40:15] age if you have received
[1:40:18] him is not by
[1:40:21] accident it's not because you are
[1:40:25] you canot
[1:40:27] boast because it is he had prepared your
[1:40:32] heart before the foundation of the
[1:40:35] world so that you can
[1:40:39] receive in this
[1:40:45] age he for you you by his for
[1:40:48] [Music]

[1:47:59] Jerusalem rocks were H at different
[1:48:04] places and come and J at
[1:48:09] Jerusalem when they were there then the
[1:48:12] builders start to
[1:48:14] build they just took the rock there and
[1:48:17] put it here when they took another one
[1:48:21] they found that it FS with this
[1:48:24] one then they take another one it with
[1:48:28] until they come one until they come to a
[1:48:30] certain
[1:48:31] Rock and that seems
[1:48:38] not very
[1:48:40] pecul they throw it
[1:48:42] away but this one cannot be
[1:48:45] usedful they go on
[1:48:48] building but when they come to the
[1:48:50] corner they look for the Stone to feed
[1:48:53] the corner there they look around the
[1:48:56] stones they are there they find no stone
[1:49:00] they go to the one they have thrown away
[1:49:03] they found that it FS the
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:08] place it was the rejected
[1:49:20] St amen
[1:49:23] am they just place a MTAR
[1:49:27] there they put the stone what is the m
[1:49:32] what is the m is
[1:49:36] love because the children of God are
[1:49:40] connected
[1:49:43] together by
[1:49:46] love that's why we don't have
[1:49:50] clicks that's why we don't have clicks
[1:49:56] groups
[1:49:57] groups the group of this one and that
[1:50:00] one and that we don't have SE in the
[1:50:05] message in the bride
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:17] group we are
[1:50:21] repellent we rep tell anything which is
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:29] not when it tries to come next to
[1:50:34] us want don't be
[1:50:38] attracted it
[1:50:47] repelled that is how they were coming
[1:50:51] together
[1:50:55] Christ is the
[1:50:59] rock now what did Moses
[1:51:02] see when he look when he was in
[1:51:08] that he saw the glory of
[1:51:11] God what what was that Glory he saw the
[1:51:14] back part of a
[1:51:17] man he was passing
[1:51:19] this you saw the back part where was he
[1:51:23] going he was going to
[1:51:26] Jerusalem what was he going to do there
[1:51:29] he was going to be put in
[1:51:33] [Applause]
[1:51:35] flesh then at our
[1:51:39] time what do you
[1:51:41] see that's why the prophet says in the
[1:51:45] book of seven Church ages he says Christ
[1:51:49] is moving
[1:51:53] between the
[1:51:54] [Applause]
[1:51:55] churches from church age to another
[1:51:58] church another church but the end there
[1:52:03] what do we hear we hear
[1:52:09] the what do we do he says he who
[1:52:13] open but when you when somebody
[1:52:16] ising when you open what do you see you
[1:52:20] see the face you don't see the back part
[1:52:24] you see the
[1:52:26] face what do we see at the
[1:52:29] age see the
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:40] face back out there at the beginning of
[1:52:43] Seven
[1:52:46] Seals when those seven angels come down
[1:52:49] in the pyramid form
[1:52:55] stood there and told me to return back
[1:53:00] here and speak on those Seven
[1:53:04] Seals he would be with
[1:53:06] me he showed me what they
[1:53:09] were those lost
[1:53:12] things I always thought it was seed
[1:53:15] outside the back of the
[1:53:20] book it would be something wrong in the
[1:53:24] book but it turned out that it was made
[1:53:28] known that he cannot do
[1:53:32] that the prophet thought to leave
[1:53:34] something written outside the
[1:53:38] book but he was told he cannot do that
[1:53:43] it is something that is written in the
[1:53:46] book is something that has been hi in
[1:53:49] the
[1:53:50] book forever ever shall take one
[1:53:55] weight from eat or add one weight to
[1:53:59] it so it is a mystery that is been in
[1:54:03] the
[1:54:05] book in these seven Church
[1:54:08] ages each one of them produce a mystery
[1:54:13] all about baptism

[2:04:53] worry God will take
[2:04:55] you and put
[2:04:58] you in the in his secret
[2:05:01] place then you will
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:08] see there is something
[2:05:12] here let me try to
[2:05:16] compare scriptures
[2:05:21] and
[2:05:24] incidences with what I have read
[2:05:27] here read Isaiah chapter 35:8 Isaiah
[2:05:34] 35:3 Isaiah chapter
[2:05:39] 35:8 to 9 I want you to read
[2:05:43] there and and Highway shall be there and
[2:05:47] a way and it shall be called the way of
[2:05:50] Holiness the unclean shall not pass over
[2:05:53] it but it shall be for those who
[2:05:56] wavering men thoughts fools shall not a
[2:06:01] therein no lion shall be there nor any
[2:06:06] rivers Beast shall go up there on it
[2:06:09] shall not be found there but the
[2:06:12] redeemed shall walk there amen I'm
[2:06:14] talking about the provided
[2:06:18] Place provided by God
[2:06:22] and a secret
[2:06:25] place Isaiah is talking about something
[2:06:28] like
[2:06:30] that he says there is a
[2:06:34] highway there are people who are outside
[2:06:37] the
[2:06:39] highway but there are people who are in
[2:06:41] the
[2:06:43] highway but there is a
[2:06:46] way but those who are in the way in the
[2:06:52] way because that way is called a way of
[2:06:58] Hol and it says the
[2:07:02] unclean will never pass
[2:07:05] over they may pass through the
[2:07:09] highway but not in the
[2:07:12] Holiness he said that one is not for
[2:07:17] all in other words to P there must be
[2:07:21] transferred from a
[2:07:24] highway it be transferred into a
[2:07:27] way it's like the book of
[2:07:30] life and the Lamb's Book of Life because
[2:07:33] you are transed from the book
[2:07:36] of to the Book of Life the book of
[2:07:41] life you are transferred from the
[2:07:44] highway to the way because it says here
[2:07:50] it is not for all
[2:07:53] it is for
[2:07:54] those the
[2:08:01] way if though
[2:08:05] fools they will never get lost
[2:08:08] there as long as they they have been
[2:08:11] brought
[2:08:12] there if you can be transferred
[2:08:16] there
[2:08:18] fools you will never get lost there
[2:08:21] because it is your
[2:08:23] place when it goes
[2:08:26] on it makes me
[2:08:28] happy because it says it for it is for
[2:08:31] the
[2:08:33] redeemed those
[2:08:35] those are the
[2:08:38] redeemed are those who who who are
[2:08:43] H from the stone because if you are
[2:08:46] youth from there when you are brought
[2:08:49] back you are redeemed
[2:08:52] [Applause]
[2:08:58] amen it is for the
[2:09:02] redeemed the
[2:09:04] owner because to
[2:09:06] redeem it is to to bring back to the
[2:09:13] original in other words these
[2:09:16] people this is their
[2:09:19] place but when they say the are
[2:09:22] redeemed it means they come from
[2:09:25] somewhere they were here they went
[2:09:27] somewhere then they were they they they
[2:09:30] went God went there to pick them and
[2:09:34] bring them back to their original
[2:09:37] place where they could
[2:09:40] see where they could enjoy
[2:09:43] themselves where they could recognize
[2:09:46] themselves who they are because without
[2:09:49] being there never recognize
[2:09:53] [Applause]
[2:09:56] yourself it is for
[2:10:00] those they
[2:10:05] redeemed the Bible says
[2:10:07] so it is for
[2:10:10] those it's not for
[2:10:15] everybody if you are
[2:10:17] part it is for
[2:10:20] you
[2:10:22] amen let me read something
[2:10:25] here it says
[2:10:27] here but with theous it shall not be
[2:10:33] so they don't have to
[2:10:36] fear they've been redeemed by
[2:10:39] God they are they are in his
[2:10:44] bosom in other words this place here is
[2:10:48] the bosom of God
[2:10:54] they are the
[2:10:56] Overcomers and who is he that
[2:11:00] overcometh he that believeth that Jesus
[2:11:04] Christ that Jesus is
[2:11:06] Christ why will these Overcomers these
[2:11:09] Believers
[2:11:13] Escape go into the Realms of eternal
[2:11:17] life because Jesus Paid the price
[2:11:23] and Ransom us from
[2:11:26] sin he fill the gap of
[2:11:30] Separation we who were a far
[2:11:33] off are now made nigh by the
[2:11:36] blood and they will never come into
[2:11:41] condemnation that's why the Bible says
[2:11:44] here even if
[2:11:47] fools even if they are
[2:11:49] fools they will not
[2:11:57] they will never be lost he will lose
[2:12:03] none no one no one of the redeemed will
[2:12:06] be anywhere except where Jesus
[2:12:17] ISU they
[2:12:20] redeemed how does he bring them
[2:12:25] there he take the book of
[2:12:28] redemption open the book
[2:12:30] of when you open them their names
[2:12:36] are the prophet says here he says he he
[2:12:41] open the
[2:12:43] seals let me see if I can see it
[2:12:47] here how he calls them
[2:12:51] he says here the seals was
[2:12:56] broke
[2:12:58] why in the last Church
[2:13:02] age to reveal this
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:07] truths the lamp broke the
[2:13:11] seals revealed them to his
[2:13:16] church in order to collect his subject
[2:13:24] for his
[2:13:26] kingdom to collect
[2:13:28] them he use
[2:13:33] seals without seals you cannot
[2:13:38] collect when you

[2:13:45] subject it is the
[2:13:48] voice voice of God
[2:13:51] that can be
[2:13:54] had by the
[2:13:58] redeemed in order to collect his subject
[2:14:01] for his
[2:14:05] kingdom PR Oh my he wants to bring this
[2:14:08] subject to him
[2:14:12] now he come to get this
[2:14:15] subject he revealed his
[2:14:18] Secrets they saw it
[2:14:22] [Applause]
[2:14:25] and time is no
[2:14:27] more time has run
