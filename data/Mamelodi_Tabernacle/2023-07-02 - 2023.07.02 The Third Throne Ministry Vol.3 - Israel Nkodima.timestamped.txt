[47:36] what he has God has given to him for the
[47:40] bride of Christ
[47:44] um
[47:46] it is here with us
[47:52] you know as we said that previous week
[47:58] we are looking at I was trying to come
[48:02] to this Gog and Megan
[48:08] and I just come short of that day in
[48:12] North Carolina
[48:14] reversed back to something
[48:18] because I will read to you again
[48:21] something here
[48:27] there is this three and a half years
[48:34] and this the three and a half years of
[48:36] the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:39] as the prophet says in the sales book
[48:43] 147.147
[48:54] then we read we go to the Bible again
[48:58] we realize Satan also
[49:02] has three and a half years
[49:07] and I think we have read our scriptures
[49:18] we have the three and a half years
[49:23] and now we have the three and a half
[49:25] years of Satan yeah
[49:35] the prophet puts it in that way
[49:39] because this lasts three and a half
[49:41] years
[49:43] it's called the tribulation period
[49:48] which if you you look at the events
[49:53] unfolding
[49:57] you can see that
[50:01] the tribulation period is here
[50:04] and uh it's just another three and a
[50:07] half years
[50:11] you know the scripture there yeah
[50:14] we I think we read that scripture last
[50:17] time
[50:19] three and a half years
[50:24] which the prophet says
[50:27] now he will become a king
[50:31] is
[50:42] there's a statement here
[50:47] that speaks of this Satan
[50:52] in his time
[50:56] at the breaking of that series
[51:01] he is referring to the seventh sea um
[51:08] that is the end of all things
[51:12] that is the seventh okay and now he says
[51:19] but he will be revealed in his time
[51:26] and the prophet says
[51:30] what statement
[51:32] after the bright is taken away
[51:37] let me read this podcast
[51:40] as I say I'm going just to take uh a
[51:45] small but spiritual part of it
[51:49] and we will still continue
[51:52] next time
[51:54] I read this part
[51:57] let no man deceive you that is
[51:59] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 9. for

[1:20:21] not going to control
[1:20:22] yes but a pastor is not somebody who's
[1:20:26] controlling somebody
[1:20:29] the pasta reaches the word of God Amen
[1:20:34] and
[1:20:35] the pastor is a Shepherd yes
[1:20:39] now a Shepherd has got a flop
[1:20:44] that's why the Lord Jesus my sheep know
[1:20:48] my voice
[1:20:51] apostle
[1:21:05] did you hear policies
[1:21:24] amen so that that's that that's it amen
[1:21:28] and
[1:21:29] now let me just read this part here
[1:21:33] it shows now the the people taking their
[1:21:36] rights
[1:21:39] doing what they want to do
[1:21:42] nobody will tell them the difference
[1:21:53] I'll do everything that I want to do
[1:21:57] I do to my family what I want to do yes
[1:22:10] is only responsible for his ship
[1:22:17] Paul was only responsible for those who
[1:22:21] reside
[1:22:31] [Applause]
[1:22:50] to her
[1:22:52] okay okay now we are we are here I'm
[1:22:57] looking the drug there
[1:23:00] yes I mean and I was with this scripture
[1:23:04] here
[1:23:05] because we we
[1:23:09] let me read you uh because we are on the
[1:23:14] audition
[1:23:16] where is that loudisha of mine
[1:23:20] amen amen
[1:23:23] and there's seven Vision
[1:23:27] where he he said I I hit a most terrible
[1:23:31] explosion
[1:23:34] that is the seven Vision
[1:23:38] but of uh
[1:23:42] who who's that who saw Sodom Abraham
[1:23:47] Abraham Abraham
[1:23:49] he saw smoke going up yeah
[1:23:54] the Bible says
[1:23:59] early in the morning he walked to the
[1:24:02] place
[1:24:03] where he stood before
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:09] amen amen but did you read off lot also
[1:24:14] a lot also he looked at the
[1:24:18] when he separated with Abraham
[1:24:21] because
[1:24:23] the problem of Lord
[1:24:26] Abraham had his head
[1:24:35] you see I mean a Shepherd has this
[1:24:40] and a sheep sayona
[1:24:45] it will be very difficult to look after
[1:24:48] that chip yeah
[1:24:53] it has its own Revelations
[1:24:59] can only look after a ship
[1:25:02] that cannot look after it
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:07] that's why the Lord is my shepherd
[1:25:10] amen what I don't know he knows
[1:25:15] all right I'm relying on him
[1:25:20] okay now
[1:25:23] this is
[1:25:25] that's where where it says
[1:25:30] it speaks of the people's rights
[1:25:35] with register last time
[1:25:38] no notice the name
[1:25:44] the people's rights
[1:25:48] or Justice of the people
[1:25:52] was there ever an age like the 20th
[1:25:57] century
[1:25:58] Church age that has seen all nations
[1:26:02] rising up
[1:26:08] demanding equality
[1:26:13] um
[1:26:16] socially and financially
[1:26:20] so that's the age we have all those
[1:26:23] things
[1:26:24] then it goes to say it was a city of
[1:26:29] earthquakes
[1:26:32] what are you seeing today
[1:26:36] earthquakes everywhere the earthquake
[1:26:40] finally
[1:26:51] destroyed it
[1:26:53] is
[1:26:56] this age will end up in God shaking the
[1:27:01] whole world
[1:27:03] the whole world
[1:27:09] is it not happening
[1:27:13] okay if you are watching hello
[1:27:19] Andy and has gone off to make love with
[1:27:24] the older heart
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:30] earlier only will the World System
[1:27:33] crumble the systems
[1:27:36] but the very Earth will be shaken it's
[1:27:39] in the system is
[1:27:42] it not happening
[1:27:44] and then
[1:27:56] he comes with the Visions now
[1:28:01] Abraham Abraham saw
[1:28:05] the smoke
[1:28:09] um
[1:28:10] and what did Brothers
[1:28:15] uh
[1:28:32] foreign
[1:29:05] you have things here
[1:29:09] like three men came to
[1:29:12] Abra Abraham
[1:29:16] but have you realized
[1:29:25] Sodom
[1:29:26] to Lord
[1:29:29] Abraham saw three men coming
[1:29:32] um
[1:29:34] amen
[1:29:41] that's why
[1:29:43] in the house of Abraham
[1:29:45] Abraham according to the book their
[1:29:48] souls in prisoner
[1:29:54] and those men when they come they were
[1:29:56] three
[1:29:59] then I will read to you next time
[1:30:03] that three is the number of Life foreign
[1:30:09] uh
[1:30:13] now when they arrive
[1:30:16] at the
[1:30:18] Lord
[1:30:22] because here I'm talking about
[1:30:26] his in identification with an individual
[1:30:30] here
[1:30:35] but we are closing we'll take just a
[1:30:39] small business
[1:30:40] the Lord willing will continue
[1:30:43] his identification
[1:30:46] is with an individual
[1:30:50] that's why he says
[1:31:03] you know I said sometimes
[1:31:08] actually we are not the message churches
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:19] because a church in the long run will
[1:31:22] start to do I mean
[1:31:29] then that one will say this one is not
[1:31:32] revealed
[1:31:35] you know it becomes
[1:31:40] God is dealing with us as
[1:31:46] you can get the pieces of the price
[1:31:50] it is
[1:32:08] now I'm looking yeah
[1:32:13] at this time love at the people's rights
[1:32:17] he says his identification is
[1:32:27] especially in these days
[1:32:31] people's rights
[1:32:34] and then he's
[1:32:37] that's why Abraham Abraham
[1:32:41] when that morning
[1:32:45] he he woke up and in the morning
[1:32:50] now in order for him to see
[1:32:54] he went back to where he stood before
[1:33:01] you know you must always find the right
[1:33:03] place
[1:33:07] he went back there
[1:33:09] from there where he stood before the
[1:33:12] Lord
[1:33:14] you could see
[1:33:21] all right amen
[1:33:22] no I'm looking at Brothers
[1:33:28] what what happened
[1:33:31] foreign
[1:33:44] as I tend to look
[1:33:47] I saw nothing because
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:05] that's the prophet
[1:34:07] and now we that are watching these
[1:34:12] things
[1:34:18] because the prophet has spoken
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:49] he was
[1:34:53] told to
[1:34:55] foreign
[1:35:20] now this is what the prophet
[1:35:43] I'm talking about the seeds
[1:35:51] will see the same thing that abrahamas
[1:35:58] it is the Seed of Abraham
[1:36:01] that's why this Seed of Abraham
[1:36:04] you remember the message the migration
[1:36:18] Abraham Abraham just appeared you know
[1:36:22] about Abraham you saw him only when
[1:36:25] um God recognized him
[1:36:29] and the Bible is
[1:36:31] recognized
[1:36:33] you only started to see him
[1:36:38] it is God who recognizes
[1:36:42] but in the form of melchization
[1:36:46] logos
[1:37:36] as the prophet puts it to you
[1:37:39] was a God
[1:37:42] and then God is a spirit
[1:37:45] [Music]
[1:37:48] a small car yes yes
[1:38:03] God the capital is
[1:38:35] the
[1:38:37] first thing it will be manifested in use
[1:38:44] Rapture is not something that I'll be
[1:38:47] waiting for
[1:38:50] um scripturally saying the Rapture is
[1:38:53] coming here I must be seriously
[1:39:01] he says potentially appreciate it is in
[1:39:07] you
[1:39:10] already
[1:39:12] you know every day when I'm walking
[1:39:15] around
[1:39:16] it is just in me
[1:39:20] anytime can be the time
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:25] did you know that
[1:39:27] uh potentially it's already in you
[1:39:36] now let me leave it here
[1:39:41] we will continue
