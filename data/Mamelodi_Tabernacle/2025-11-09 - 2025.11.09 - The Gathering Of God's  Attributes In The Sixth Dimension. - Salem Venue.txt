He believed the message in the early7s after coming across the spoken word, the god of this evil age. He has dedicated his life to the preaching of this message and has traveled around the world in many countries in Africa. May he so rest in peace. Thank you. Amen. He becomes another person. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So, we've got the lost and found here. We've got a cell phone and then we've got classes. You can come to me after service then we can be able to give it to you. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we are coming to a very crucial time. The time of the word of the Lord. I will request my pastor, pastor Maka to approach the pullpit. He will know what to do from here. Let me see whether Okay, we've got the message from Tanzania. Our brother will just read it. God bless you believers. Greetings from Tanzania from Pastor Shija and the saints. H another home church of Pastor Anodim. The pastor says he is very sorry and say may the father in heaven comfort all of you with his grace and love. The pastor says it's very hard and and sad but we have to accept what God has has done. He loves you all. God bless you all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think we've got another announcement. Okay, we've got one from Botswana. H my memory of Pastor Israelima. Reflections from Kabaroni Botswana. Greetings to pastor's family and Madori tabernacle. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. We received with heavy hearts and grief the news of the passing away of Pastor Israelima. If it were by our will, this notable teacher of the lifegiving message should have continued in the land of the living. However, God's will is even mightier than collective human will. On account of his contribution to our spiritual development in Botswana, I felt it was important to render therefore to all their Jews. Tribute to whom uh to tribute to whom tribute is due. Custom to whom custom is due. Fear to whom fear is due. Honor to whom honor is due. Romans 13:7. I hereby render my reflections of pastoral guima as a way of honoring him. Our memories are flooded with vivid unforgettable images and moments we encountered with with here on earth between 2005 and 2008. Pastor and his entourage frequently visit us in Botswana. It was an act of love and sacrifice of his part, his family and his assembly. May God reward you all with such current effort. During this missionary during his missionary trips the frequently he frequently ministered in H in Mulaboni and Matimab in Cabaroni. Sometimes it was normal local assembly services. At times it was special combined meetings and once in a while it was a convention. In April of 2006 he ordained me a pastor in Metab Tabernacle Greater Cabaron area. A year later he ordained pastor a pastors of Mabor and Kabani respectively. Indeed, Pastor Anadima got involved in Botswana at our critical stage of spiritual development, a defining moment in our history. With sound teaching, courage, and sheer determination, he propelled the affforementioned three places to a state of complete order. He believed we could amount to something noteworthy for God's glory. What an inspiring faith and confidence. His last visit to Botswana was in 2009 and it was tremendous. We cannot forget the sermon he preached here in Botswana like the end of the seventh seal making me sanctuary beyond the kitten of time to mentioned by a few. It was always a blessing to see his remarkable teaching ministry move the audience from the comfort zone into the deeper zone of the revealed word of the day. He told the seven seal angels message distinct distinctly to make a sense to it much like Ezra the teacher and the scribe of Zerubbabel restoration Zerubbabel's restorations days it was always easy to note that this notable teacher was not just an aid um avid reader or dedicated student of Malachi 4 but he had revelation of the cont contents of Elijah's message. So profound was so profound was the impact of his teaching that he always led us a notch higher and yet craving for more. After attending his preaching services, one would feel like reading the message and the Bible more, praying more, seeking a closer walk with God, and believing God for things thought impossible. What an invaluable impact. We shall forever be grateful for his contribution to our spiritual growth during a critical stage [music] of spiritual journey. We shall surely miss this amazing member of the five-fold ministry whose teachings h with teaching whose teaching gift could make pictures uh with ways a teaching ministry which made the present day truth tangible and tactical through the unforgettable h pictorial and mental illustration. Furthermore, whether it was a convention in Botswana or a a convention in Mosul Bay or a convention in Mamoi, a wedding in Tbisa, Pastor Israel delivered Pastor Israel's delivery of the gospel was always captivating and stirring. He taught He taught the deep he taught the depth of message with simplicity. For he was a simple man, easy to approach and interact with. He bore the offense of the cross with simplicity with a smile and noticeable calmness. [music] May God comfort the Guima family and the Mor tabernacle during this passing face of grief. May God bless you and see you through and keep you. Brother Samuel Muli pastor pastor from Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is our precious pastor. Amen. Amen.

First is to preachers. &gt;&gt; Two preachers. The people who be standing here preaching, I'll be watching from Malawi. If I see you campaigning, &gt;&gt; you are disqualified. Disqualifying, &gt;&gt; no self-promotion. By the way, I uh sorry, even at home, I don't have many friends. &gt;&gt; I'm very straightforward. Even if there were 10 pastors agreeing, I would say no. because I've left the world for the message. I don't want to be in a political party in the request to the church. Oh yeah, let me start with the warning first. Beware of people who come in sheep's clothes. &gt;&gt; Anybody who tell you to move out of this church is a wolf. Anybody who comes you and tells you better to move to a better place. There's no better place than this. Don't be carried away by people who come here and try to pull you this way or that way. Our pastor preached to us very well here. He He has left us in harmony. We'll wait for the rapture here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or else you have to come to see the pastor in the rapture to apologize to him for moving away from his church. Be here. Peace always well church. One day the the disciples came to Jesus and asked him if my brother wronged me how many times should I forgive him. &gt;&gt; So they decided at least seven times a day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. They said how many times? &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a to give somebody for in a day to forgive somebody seven times is very good. What did Jesus tell them? 70 times 70. If you are believers, you are going to be forgiving one another. 4,900 times a day. &gt;&gt; 4,900 times church. &gt;&gt; Let's have a heart of forgiving. &gt;&gt; Peace will prevail here. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you forgive one another, peace will prevail. If you pre to forgive one another.

And this is the prayer. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you the prayer. God give us a a pastor like pastor. &gt;&gt; We want a pastor will be here. Uh the pastor who should stand here should be in in another board. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you.

Your faces are glowing. I can see that everything is fine. &gt;&gt; God is in control of everything. situation. &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, a church like this one &gt;&gt; is so settled with the weight by having a pastor like Pastor Israel. God is here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm so confident that everything is going to be well. Yeah, I'm so confident. &gt;&gt; Okay. And I'm so glad also to see my friends boo. &gt;&gt; God bless you. much. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; this morning I have a a subject I want to talk with you &gt;&gt; about the gathering of God's attributes in the sixth dimension the gathering of God's attributes in the six dimension. And we can read the word directly in first Thessalonians &gt;&gt; chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 &gt;&gt; beginning by verse 13. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. The Bible say I read in Jesus Christ name. &gt;&gt; But we do not want you to be ignorant brothers about those who are asleep that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the Lord will not preede those who have fallen asleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of a comment with the voice of an archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, encourage one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God b his blessing on the reading of these words. So you know with a message like ours, &gt;&gt; the voice of the seven angel, what is nothing else but the seven seals. Everything that was kept secret during the ages must be revealed by the message and everything was revealed. But today I want just to take your attention on something. I I think it's very important for you as a believers that you must know as Paul say in the Bible. You must not be uninformed about two things. two things. Listen to me now. The prophecy in the message, who is this? Paragraph point 112 paragraph 112 the prophet says &gt;&gt; now we see here &gt;&gt; in the sermon who is meched the objective of God when the prophet was preaching that sermon is to let you see plainly &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; The complete secret of our lives in JOURNEY and death. When we go after we die also predestination in plain view here. Now listen as we teach this close. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; There are two things you must know and those things must be explained to you in plain view. First thing, where are you going after death? Where exactly are you going? That's the first point. The second point, where do you come FROM by predestination? There are two things you must know. Where are you going? When your journey here on earth is done, God wants you to know exactly where you are going. Then at the same time, God wants you to know exactly in plain VIEW where do you come from? And when you know where you are going and where you are coming from, then you know exactly where you are. Your position is revealed to you. When you understand where you are going and where DO YOU COME FROM? BECAUSE YOU ARE IN between between death and eternity. Knowing your position makes you in position to go to the rapture because the prophet connected the rapture with the knowledge of your position. Let let me hear in amen. Amen. The prophet says the day you will know your position is the day you go to the rapture. And as we are sitting here today, we are only waiting for the rapture. So if you are waiting for the rapture, you must know your position. And to know your position means two things. You must know where YOU YOU COME FROM AND WHERE ARE you going? Give me an amen and I could Amen. And the prophet go on. Now if you know where you come from then the the mystery of your predestination will be revealed to you. Predestination means there is a force behind you that will call you and be able to keep you until you reach destination. It does not depends on you. THERE IS A FORCE behind you THAT CALLED YOU IN THIS MESSAGE and that power HAS A CAPACITY TO KEEP YOU until you reach destination. And today I come to SAY TO YOU, you will reach DESTINATION because the power of predestination is so powerful that he can even work against your own will. If God before the foundation OF THE WORLD, SO YOU HEAR THERE IS NO MAN THAT CAN MOVE YOU FROM HERE BECAUSE THAT POWER OF predestination has received a command from GOD KEEP YOU AT THE RIGHT PLACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because children of God are attributes from God and the attributes of God were in the thinking of God and elected is a chosen one. AND IF HE'S A CHOSEN, it's because he was with God before the foundation. Actually, where you are going is the very place you came from. So there is no possibility for you to get lost. You just going to recather where you COME FROM. God actually in the rapture is the calling of his own attributes. Amen. It's God calling God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet says. in the message, &gt;&gt; the identified Christ of all ages. &gt;&gt; Identify Christ of all ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said this, &gt;&gt; I could not find the point, but you you will find it as as I as I'm reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said this. &gt;&gt; Now, God is a great like a great being. Elohim is a great being in the beginning. God, &gt;&gt; see he was not even God. You know that to to begin with in the beginning God was not God. Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet said God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship. He was self-existent and there was nothing to WORSHIP HIM. WHEN he created angels then there was something to worship him. Hey, and you heavy. &gt;&gt; You know, we are the only GROUP OF PEOPLE who know God before he became God. You know, the the the messenger, the prophet received from God's the mission to reveal God to his people. You know those those churches, Pentecostals and others, they don't know that God was not God in the beginning. But you and I we know that God was not God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he became God when he created angels. And the Bible says God the Father who is invisible told the angels TO WORSHIP the angel of the Lord. THEN GOD became God. Hey, let me say amen. So I go on. He He was a selfexistent. He was big. The prophet says he was a thinking. He was just a mind. God the father was cannot be seen. No one has seen God at any time. And when he WAS IN THIS F the invisible one inside of him there were attributes. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that in this great god Elohim was attribute. There was attribute in there to be gods. Attribute to be fathers. to be attribute to be savior ATTRIBUTE TO BE HEALER. THIS ATTRIBUTE WAS IN GOD BUT THEY WERE INVISIBLE BECAUSE ATTRIBUTES ARE thinking and you cannot SEE THINKING BUT WHEN THE THINKING of God was expressed then it become the word and when the word get in flesh THEN YOU CAN SEE THE attribute of God the flesh the in the flesh is the manifestation of the attribute of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they say that you are the attribute of God, it means when the word of God gets in you, you become good. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only way &gt;&gt; by what the world can see God &gt;&gt; is you. Amen. Give me an amen. Amen. Amen. It's you. The prophet say, "And if you have got eternal life, someone here has eternal life here. Let me see your hand. The prophet says if you ever got eternal life, you are in God's attitude because you are eternal life. Amen. Amen. Because eternal life is the only life of God himself. And if you say you have eternal life, that's only means that you are God. Because the eternal life is a form of God HIMSELF and that is called the Zoe. Hallelujah. Zoe. &gt;&gt; It's the only life of God himself. Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus came as a redeemer and redeem means you get back to where he started. That's what redemption means. You were somewhere and redeemer redemption means you are now going where you came from. Amen. Amen. AND YOU WERE WITH GOD TO start with AND THEN YOU CAME HERE TO BE A MANIFESTATION and the rapture IS BRINGING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. So you are obliged to reach your destination. Even if you go down the valley, you have ups and downs. Good days and bad days, high level AND DOWN. ONE THING IS A SURE WE REACH THE WHY? Because you were there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says you were in God's thinking. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like a man, let's let's go down there. Like a man making chime. So the church put in so so much breast and so MUCH knows just exactly where you belong. [laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what exactly where you belong. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG to Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR PROMISE IS THE SEVEN SINS. &gt;&gt; Your promise is THE SEVEN SINS &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE GOING TO THE REALITY. HE KNOWS EXACTLY where you belong. He knows even what age you belong in. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Because the prophecies in eternity when you were just thinking of God, you were not like this. You were just attributes of God. There in eternity, God had a CONFERENCE with all his attributes. You talked about this journey together with God himself and in that conference you chose pastor as your pastor and God SAY AMEN AND YOU CHOSE AS YOUR CHURCH and in eternity GOD SAY AMEN. AND today God knows exactly where you are. And God knows under what ministry he puts you. You know when you come to church it looks like it was your own choosing. But let me tell you, it was not you, &gt;&gt; it's him. [laughter] And the prophet goes and says even when you are in the message, it looks like it was your own efforts and trying also to keep on in the message. Let me tell you, no one can keep himself IN THE MESSAGE. THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS GIVING YOU HIMSELF AND HE knows exactly how to do his job. You are going to go nowhere. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in that conference we decided everything and we saw even our fallen our our downs. And the prophet says, "God saw you from the beginning to the end. He knew YOUR WEAKNESSES. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. HE KNEW HOW bad you are. It chose you. [cheering and applause] You know what? Even when I'm preaching here, I'm not a good THE BEST ONE. NO, but God chose me to be to do this. It It WAS NOT MY CHOOSING. IT was him. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I'M HERE, HE MUST BE HERE WITH ME. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's go on. I have so many things to say today. Give me three hours. The prophet says, "And therefore if you got eternal life, the word eternal is something never did begin or never can end. If you have eternal life, it means you never begin and you never cease. So whoever you were see you were, you always were. You see you you not started just here. You were eternal. &gt;&gt; Even before you get to the message because eternal means it cannot start, it cannot begin AND IT CANNOT END. So it means you always were eternal. But when you believe the message is the manifestation of your eternity. &gt;&gt; SAY AMEN TO the world is the manifestation of your eternity. In the beginning of the word, you were God's attributes being displayed. Because if you were a thinking of God when God spoke his thinking out, then you became a word. That's why today you are called a a a word bride because you are the word of God. You you are not just a listener of the word. You are the word. That's the reason you you understand the words because you are the word. You are the message of the hour. That's the reason you believe the message. You cannot believe what you are not. Actually, you say amen to what you are. Amen. Each child of God was first and attributed. That means a thinking then that attribute displeased by becoming a word and then after becoming the word that word gets in a flesh. Hallelujah. Amen. The word in the FLESH IS THE revelation of God. as a thinking you cannot see God when it becomes a word that's a pillar of fire it can appear and disappear when the word get IN THE FLESH THEN YOU see gods amen you see a man who VEILS THE WORLD IN YOUR GENERATION YOU SEE GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the word is a thought &gt;&gt; made manifest. You know that. &gt;&gt; And the word is a thought manifest. You think it then speak it. Like you say the light. Before saying the light, you had to think the light. When you think about the light, then you speak the light. And then the light is there. And you must think first that you are a son of God. Then speak it. I am a son of God. Then you become a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything that you want to be manifested must first get in your thinking. That's the way God created heaven and earth. God first think about the world then he speak it and then it was there. Never have a negative confession of yourself. Never have a negative confession of what your church is. Melody is the best church over the world. Amen. Yeah. Hallelujah. like like like Jesus when he was walking on earth and he asked to Peter and he said if you don't eat my flesh don't drink my blood you don't have eternal life and then Peter looked to him he said we know that you have the word of life where are we going we go nowhere because we held the word of life here in this church. You have heard the word of your translation FOR YOUR RAPTURE. EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IT FROM HERE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THERE'S NO PLACE WE ARE. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's no church here who can preach a word like here. I always said I always tell my my church. I only got two churches where I can preach freely. Hosana tabernacle &gt;&gt; and [applause] here I can preach. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Because you have the level together these two things. You [applause] you have the caliber. You get the caliber to receive those things. &gt;&gt; Hey, I want you to just clap your hand for yourself. Never, never, ever have a negative confession about yourself, about your brother, about your sister, about your church. NEVER, EVER, always be positive. [applause] I can see this church growing. I can see this CHURCH BLESSED. I see blessing of God coming up on this. I can see the people here prospering IN REVELATION IN POWER IN EVERYTHING because I am a thinking of God. And when I confess it then it will be &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet end by saying we are God's attributes displayed. Yes. Amen. Displayed. Attributes of God displayed. So we were with him in the beginning and then we were displayed. We left heaven. We went here to be manifested to be tempted and to win the battle. And we are winners to this morning. Hallelujah. Amen. And then God promised us another gathering. &gt;&gt; We must be gathered again. Your earthly journey is over because there is a time allotted for every one of you. There is no permanent dwelling here on earth. But if this dwelling PLACE IS DESTROYED, WE KNOW THAT THERE is another way to live for us because we cannot die. &gt;&gt; You You cannot have eternal life and then die. [clears throat] You cannot. The prophecies in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 482. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Death does not change you, but death only change your dwelling place." So it's just about changing dwelling places and changing dwelling places means &gt;&gt; changing dimensions dimension. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We change only dimensions. We came from one dimension. We get into this dimension. And when our time is over, we have to change the dwelling place. CHANGING DIMENSION dimension &gt;&gt; but we are still we &gt;&gt; nothing will change but only the dwelling place. So now let's deal with one point. Who are those who are supposed to be gathered in that sixth dimension? We'll have time today to speak about dimension. I know you know those things but I want just to repeat it with you. Who are those who are going to be gathered in that sixth dimension? The prophet says in the message I have heard but now I see. I've heard but now I see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Point 10 104 104. &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; only the elected can be gathered. &gt;&gt; Elected you see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elected means there were many but God chose you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God chose you. &gt;&gt; There were many but elected. The prophet says the elected of God seen it in Noah's time. How can you know that you are elected when you can see the message of your time? And what is the message of your time? It's not the first poll. It's not the second P. Those words only the means of God used to attract you. When they pray for you and you are healed, that's not a message. That's just something to attract you. when they prophesize on you and it's it's glorious, but that's not the message. It's just a way for God to attract you AFTER THE SIGNS, AFTER MIRACLES, WHEN YOU SIT DOWN IN A teaching service, then the message came and the message of the hour is the seven seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seven sea. &gt;&gt; The silence. That's the message. Amen. The message is in the silence. Because those are being selected are so precious. God won't let in someone who is not in this plane. And God puts the message in a silence like in the time of Daniel when the king Nebuchadnezzar had that dream and he called all the magicians and told them I had the dream in the night and I I want you first give me the dream. Second is interpretation. &gt;&gt; The magicians. &gt;&gt; There are also many preachers that are magicians and God knew them before the foundation of the world. They cannot manipulate our message. They put it in a silence. PREACH THE SEVEN. THERE IS A SILENCE. AMEN. How can a preacher speak? Well, GOD DID NOT SPEAK. THAT'S YOUR MESSAGE. NOW, only God can speak when God sings. Someone has got my point. If someone can preach where God has sealed, it means it's not a man, but it's God himself. THE THIRD POOL IS NOT A MAN. &gt;&gt; THE THIRD pool is God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ah amen. The prophet says it only the elected put it only the elected could seen it in Noah's time in Moses time in Jesus time in the apostle time in Luther time in Wesley Pentecostal times because that was the seed that was on earth when the inspiration was poured out. So you were there when God spoke it in eternity. And when God seal it, you can still hear because God spoke to you about those things before you come here. When the inspiration is called out, you listen something coming FROM YOUR THEOPHONY. LET LET LET ME SAY amen to that myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says a son of God when a preacher IS PREACHING YOU ARE NOT listening from the preacher. God has put just across you behind at your side your theophony. YOUR THEOPHONY IS JUST THERE. AND WHEN I'm preaching your theophony explain those things to you from heart to heart even when I'm preaching I preach from my heart. I'm not using my head. No, I'm not using this because the things I'm saying I have not WRITTEN THEM SOMEWHERE. JUST COMES from God in my heart and it goes to you in your theophony and your theophony put it in your heart and you say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's so sacred. The prophet said the third pool is so sacred. No one must say something about that. spirit [applause] because okay okay let let's put it now now while the inspiration is pulled out to gather the bride together it's only those who are elected will see If you see the message of the hour the seven seas that means you are elected. Amen. And if you are elected, &gt;&gt; then you are a candidate candidate when your journey or here on earth will be done. When you cross the Jordan, you will be reathered in a higher divine dimension called the sixth dimension. Dimension. It's only the elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, I thank thee that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise AND PRUDENCE AND REVEALED it such as we learn. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; let's go on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About the gathering of God's attribute. You understand the point. You must have been an attribute there before then displayed here, manifested in the flesh to receive the message. to gather you back where you came from. That's the plan. If you were not there, you cannot get to the sixth dimension because there is a selection. Only the selected ones can get there. Not the members of church, but the bride. &gt;&gt; You are no more the church here. You are the bride. I want the amen coming from the balcony. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there is a sixth dimension and the prophet says when God created heaven and earth, God created many earth. Dimensions are worlds. Dimensions are worlds. Dimension. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. as real as this one. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dimensions &gt;&gt; a world as real as this. It's not a fiction. It's not a dream, but it's as real as touchable. YOU CAN TOUCH IT AND YOU CAN TOUCH THE PEOPLE who live in those dimensions. And there are seven the prophet says &gt;&gt; in the message present stage of my ministry paragraph 199 the prophet says this. &gt;&gt; Let me go quickly with this. I know this pulpit is pastor pulpit and he taught you all of those things. I'm just here to support it. Yeah. You remember in the vision the the little translation translation as I will call it the prophet when when he went there in that world called the sixth dimension. The prophet says it was a translation translation. &gt;&gt; You know the translations is the mean by what you can get into that sixth dimension and the dimension the translation is also a way for you to get into the rapture. So the secret of the rapture is hid here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? Now, &gt;&gt; now the prophet says, &gt;&gt; you remember the little translation as I called it was when I was taken. Are you with me? The prophet was taken and he was he was he was laying on his bed. And he came out from his body and he left his body laying on the bed and was taken in another dimension. &gt;&gt; And he called it translation. The prophet says, he says, I saw those people and looked back to myself and all those millions there. You see, he could see himself laying down at the same time seeing those millions coming to him and he could not explain it. He called and was taken into another dimension. And the dimension was real. And people were there AS YOUNG AS EVER AND strong and beautiful girls and women, beautiful men. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I want to see Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When your time here is over, &gt;&gt; when you cross Jordan, &gt;&gt; your first your first desire must be to see Jesus. [applause] But he could not see him. They told him is higher. &gt;&gt; There is another dimension higher than the sixth one. THAT HIGHER dimension &gt;&gt; is the seventh dimension. Jesus is not in the sixth. Jesus is in the seventh. But you are not gather in the seventh. You are gather in the sixth. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you cross Jordan, when your life is over, you will see your brothers and sisters. You shall see. Amen. Not Jesus because Jesus is higher. The gathering, &gt;&gt; the gathering of God's attributes &gt;&gt; is in the sixth dimension dimension. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in the seventh dimension, God lives there alone. The prophet continues, &gt;&gt; listen, he said, well, &gt;&gt; see, when people die, &gt;&gt; when people die, they don't immediately go up with God. Now remember, &gt;&gt; God is revealing to you &gt;&gt; the secrets of death. Where you go when your time here is over. You must know what is going on there. You won't be immediately with God, but you will be gathered with your brothers and sisters. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were coming from everywhere and saying to our prophets, our precious brother, we are happy to see you here. When your TIME IS OVER, YOU ARE passing over there and you MEET PASTOR AND YOU SAY, "PASTOR, [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD to see you here, &gt;&gt; our precious brother." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet says &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; I'm sure you will understand that. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding what the prophet said? &gt;&gt; Don't be ignorant like those who have no hope. God wants you to know before you leave here who are there waiting for you and what is going on there because you are a selected people. You cannot just go in a rapture in ignorance of what is going on there. God wants you to know exactly what will be there when we reach that place. He said maybe I to explain it the best that I can. So even the prophet he he understood that it's not easy for people to get that point. Let me be clear now. You will get Jesus, right? But when you get there, there will be no Jesus there but your brothers and sisters because Jesus is higher. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you will be gathered with the people that you know. I I didn't bring that that quote today, but the prophet says even when you are ready to go to the rapture, &gt;&gt; the people that was gone before that we come back here that you shall meet must be the person that you know. Not Peter, not Paul, not Boswell. but your South African brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; and especially your leader &gt;&gt; because your leader stands for God for you. Hey, I I didn't hear. Amen. Remember an attribute of God when it becomes the word and that word get into the flesh. You see God. Amen. You see God. Amen. Hey, I like this church &gt;&gt; because you get the point so quickly. Yeah, I can feel it that you are understanding what I'm saying because I I I feel the the reaction, the feedback feedback. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, every preacher when people are getting what you are preaching, you can feel it. When they are not getting, it returns back to you. &gt;&gt; Then you close your book and say, "Amen." That's all. But when you are still receiving like this you are giving me more hours. [laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen now. &gt;&gt; The prophet said &gt;&gt; 20. Well, see, okay. Oh, no. No, no. Uh uh let me go there. He said, let's take our our time. &gt;&gt; It was where? Okay. Uh are you in hurry? No. &gt;&gt; No. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I don't wait for your answer, please. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I just respond for you. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you near? No. Let's take our time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, prophet. Let's take our time. Amen. Amen. And and and try to make it just as clear as I can. So this means it's important. Now when we come along we remember that we live here in three dimensions. You know that there are three dimensions here. We are living simultaneously in three dimension. And the prophet says I don't know whether I can name them or not. You can prophet. &gt;&gt; One of them is amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the other is matter. &gt;&gt; So the light is also a dimension. Light is a dimension. &gt;&gt; And anything that you can touch is also a dimension. Dimension. &gt;&gt; Matter is a dimension. &gt;&gt; Matter dimension. &gt;&gt; Tommy. &gt;&gt; You remember what the third is? &gt;&gt; Someone say something. He say, &gt;&gt; someone says time. The prophet say time. So we are living here with three dimensions. The first one is life. The second is matter &gt;&gt; and the third one is time. So when your time to leave this earth come, when you start your journey to the sixth dimension to be gathered there, you must leave the three diamonds. So now you must understand how this happened. When you live here, first dimension you are living will be light. &gt;&gt; Every light will shut off when you are living. &gt;&gt; But be courageous. &gt;&gt; That won't last long. Every light, artificial light will shut off. &gt;&gt; Even the natural light also, the sun, the moon, the stars off. That's the first thing that we are. and you'll get into the darkness. Even when God was created the earth is started by the night, the night is announcing light. There cannot be light unless the darkness comes through. That's why sometimes the dark days announce the sunny days. Now you are crying but tomorrow you will be rejoicing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It starts by the evening. There was a night. There was an evening. Then there was a day and God called it the first day. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LIGHTS WILL shut off. &gt;&gt; Then you got you get in the dark. &gt;&gt; That means you just left the first dimension. &gt;&gt; The second dimension you are going to leave is matter. You will lose the sensitivity of your body. It may start by the tools up to the hell or from the the hell to the to you could not feel yourself. That means you have just left the second side. THEN THE THIRD ONE IS time and the doctor will come and write somewhere brother sister who and who has died 12 &gt;&gt; the 7th of November. So the calendar just ain't there for you. That will mean you just left the third DIMENSION DIMENSION WHICH IS TIME. Time will no more be for you because time is a dimension. Can I go on? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; okay time. &gt;&gt; And our five senses contact them dimensions our feeling matters. Let's go on now. But we have a contact through science. That's the fourth dimension dimension as it was because coming right through this building comes pictures voices of radio. pictures on television. Our senses does not contact but yet they have a tube that picks up those waves and manifest them. The fourth dimension dimension &gt;&gt; is the dimension of waves dimension wave there are images &gt;&gt; it's a dimension &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so you see &gt;&gt; right in this building now is life actions of people in the Yeah. Live voices, &gt;&gt; they are here. &gt;&gt; We know it. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says somewhere, &gt;&gt; if you say something against someone, your voice live on. It will go all over the world then return to you. It lives on. &gt;&gt; And the only way to stop it, to erase it in the board of God is to make it right. [applause and cheering] Amen. &gt;&gt; So, confess it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Confess it exactly like you said it. One weakness I saw in the church is not be able to say I'm wrong. That was not good. Be as a Christian to say I'm wrong. I'm sorry. I should not have done it. Forgive me. And that's all. That's all. Make it a practice in your life. We are not angels. We are human beings. [applause and cheering] We make heroes. We make fools. We are human beings and God knows it. But as a Christian, you must repent and confess. I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry, SISTER. AND THAT'S ALL. &gt;&gt; When you say that, the prophet says when someone ask for forgiveness, you must forgive. And when you forgive, he still your brother. Amen. Don't keep any grief in your heart. How you say? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't keep in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the voices &gt;&gt; are living in the fourth dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make it right. &gt;&gt; I learned this the hard way for myself. &gt;&gt; The hard way. I I just I I was just young just received the message and I read it in the message prophet says go to your brother go to your sister don't say to anyone go to him and I said something very bad about that a man and that man was a polit politician because we we we knew in a family we have some relationship. &gt;&gt; I said to myself how to repay it. I have to go to find that man. He was a Catholic. He was he was a Catholic praying somewhere in. And I go to that place &gt;&gt; because you know there they have the the the cult in the service in early in the morning 56 I go there &gt;&gt; and I met him I said oh what are you doing here &gt;&gt; he was so surprised to see me I say I have something to say I said okay what's going on say I say this this this against you but it's not itever I just come to say forgive me for no there's nothing that no it's okay it was okay for him but it was not okay for me and since that time I keep my mouth &gt;&gt; I don't want it anymore if I have something against you. I tell you right now, that's how it works. I'll go straight to you. &gt;&gt; If I don't say anything straight to you, don't imagine that I have something against you now. I heard it. I go to it and finish that book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our sermon. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, &gt;&gt; he says, you know, I don't understand the mechanics of those things that science has invented. We know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension. So when you leave this earth you go through dimensions to be gathered to the sixth of second matter. You lose sensitivity of your senses. You lose them. Then you go to the time stop for you. No calendar, no nothing. They will put on your tomb the day you stop living in a time. That means time stops for you at that time. Then you go on and the fourth now the waves and those things You must go there. Then you reach the fifth. The prophet says, "Now the fifth dimension &gt;&gt; is where the sinner, &gt;&gt; the unbeliever dies and goes to the fifth dimension &gt;&gt; is the kind of of the horrible dimension. horrible dimension dimension &gt;&gt; is the thief. &gt;&gt; It's called also the the the how do you call it in English the the hell &gt;&gt; yeahis hell &gt;&gt; the hell &gt;&gt; yeah in French they say they say or something okay hell &gt;&gt; hell when you die as unbeliever You will leave also the first dimension. You leave the first dimension leave it. Every human being then the second then the third then the fourth and then when you reach the fifth that's hell. Big doors will open to you. and receive you in that dimension that horrible dimension dimension. And when you get there, the door will close after you [clears throat] to prevent you for that. Jesus said to Peter, &gt;&gt; "Who do you say that I, the son of man, is Peter said, &gt;&gt; you are Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of God, &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, &gt;&gt; Peter, &gt;&gt; it's not the flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; no pastor, &gt;&gt; no one who has just revealed this to you, &gt;&gt; the revelation of who I am. Upon this revelation, upon this rock, upon the revelation of myself, I will build my church. And the doors of HELL &gt;&gt; SHALL not prevail against it. Amen. If you are a believer, if you have the revelation who the son of man is the revelation of the flesh that Elohim is using in the time that you are living, IF YOU HAVE THAT REVELATION WHEN YOU REACH the fifth dimension, THE GO WILL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST YOU PASS THE DOOR. So the the the key, the secrets to prevail when you reach that horrible dimension is to receive the revelation now. When you are still alive, because when YOU DIE, THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR YOU TO PREVAIL THE GATES OF HELL. YOU WILL GET THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; Horrible dimension. &gt;&gt; Dimension is the prophet went there. &gt;&gt; You know that story. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When he was disobeying, &gt;&gt; God put him there. He said when I was dead, there was no mama there. There was no papa there. There was no God there. THERE WAS NO NOTHING THERE. ONLY HORRIBLE CREATURES IN THE DARKNESS FOREVER. THAT'S HOW PEOPLE ESCAPE FROM THAT PLACE. HOW? by receiving the revelation of the son of man. [applause] THE REVELATION OF GOD IN THE FLESH, GOD [screaming] IN THE FLESH IS THE POWER to prevail the gates of hell. And the prophecy in that place there is no flow. It's just like how do you call the P in English? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Bottomless piece. &gt;&gt; Bottomless beast. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's it's a bottomless piece. Can you imagine? You are there for years and years and years in a place where there is no flow and you see horrible creatures going there. THEY WILL EVEN FIGHT AGAINST YOU. THEY WILL EVEN THEY TOUCH YOU, TRY TO KILL YOU, but you won't be dead because you are already dead because of your own &gt;&gt; already dead. day. Yes. Amen. They they could not kill you for the second time because you already but they can harm you. The prophet says this place escape from this place. &gt;&gt; Being a church members is not enough. Reading the message &gt;&gt; is not enough. &gt;&gt; Listening to tapes &gt;&gt; is not enough. &gt;&gt; Receiving the revelation is the key. The revelation, &gt;&gt; not what you read, &gt;&gt; but what is in what you are reading. There is a message in the message. There is a voice in the voice. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why there was a silence because anyone who received the revelation must get to that sixth DIMENSION because the true church of God is built upon the revelation and revelation means the word in the flesh. The word out of the flesh is no more a revelation. But when you take that word, you see it in the flesh, then you receive the revelation because God here on earth can only be seen by human beings. You reject the man. You reject God. You reject Noah. You reject God. YOU REJECT MOSES. YOU REJECT GOD. YOU REJECT JESUS. YOU REJECT GOD. YOU REJECT THE PROPHET. YOU REJECT GOD. YOU REJECT. AMEN. YOU REJECT [screaming] TO GOD. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You know human beings &gt;&gt; are the flesh of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't never ever see God. But the people that God ARE USING AND WHEN YOU reject those people, you reject God. &gt;&gt; And that's a revelation. &gt;&gt; You know, when I was there at the funeral, &gt;&gt; when my father was there in that coffin. &gt;&gt; And I looked at the pastors that were present there and I realized that the people of God are very few. Let me say this, maybe it's personal. If someone has not seen God in pasta to honor his burial, that man is not of God. It was painful for me. to realize that the church of God in South Africa were absent. They did not believe [snorts] those thing that pastor was preaching all of these days. They would get stuck in the fifth dimension. Believe me, they will get stuck there. You know, anyone who has God in his heart will always recognize God in the heart of another. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the way I use myself to know who is who. Humbly I know who I am. &gt;&gt; If you don't love me, I know who you are. [applause] Let's go on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a Christian means someone who believe Christ. &gt;&gt; To believe Christ is different from to believe Jesus. Christ means a man anointed. When God put his anointing on a man and you believe that man, you are a true Christian. And a Christian when he dies, he goes into THE SIXTH DIMENSION. BECAUSE IN THAT SIXTH DIMENSION, HE WON'T MEET JESUS, &gt;&gt; but he won't meet human beings who were anointed with God. Let me explain it. There is a language barrier. I'm I'm I'm fighting to have the good word, the best way to explain Listen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when when you are on earth, &gt;&gt; we preach you Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and you believe in him. &gt;&gt; You see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you you arrive at sixth dimension, you will be there because you believe the word coming from a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; This part don't don't receive it. &gt;&gt; There's a problem here. [laughter] Let me speak it again. When the prophet arrived there in the sixth dimension, do you remember what the brothers and sister told him? They said to him, "If you were not here, we could not arrive here. It's because of what YOU shall then we are here. [applause and cheering] WE ARE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF JESUS BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU A human being. [laughter] Amen. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL MAKE IT TO THIS PLACE. I CAN FEEL IT. YOU WILL BE THERE. THE PROPHET SAY I SAW YOU THERE. [screaming] [cheering] I feel that I feel the sixth DIMENSION VIBRATING IN MY HEART. YOU ARE A PART OF that dimension BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN GOD IN A MAN. AMEN. That's a Christian. Even you know even the prophet himself he was so disturbed said why are you all of you say precious brother hey no I want to see Jesus he said no he's not here oh and they they took the prophet and they they put him on the higher place and said you sit there people say why on earth. You are a leader. [cheering] Amen. YOU WILL BE GATHERED in the sixth DIMENSION WITH YOUR LEADER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's Christianity. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] Woo. Jesus. [applause] When when a Christian dies, he goes into the sixth dimension. And God is in the dimension. Do you see it's a different dimension? dimension is a world dimension &gt;&gt; and you don't go to the seven who see Jesus but you go to the SIXTH with your Amen then you see &gt;&gt; the Christian &gt;&gt; when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God under the altar. The altar is the seven &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD IS. BUT WHEN you dies, you don't go on THE ALTAR under the ALTAR and then you receive rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet goes on 25. He said to break it down, he want to explain it better. When a man has a nightmare, nightmare. Nightmare. Amen. &gt;&gt; I used to have nightmares when I was a kid. I could see myself in a forest in the darkness AND SOMEONE FOLLOWING ME following me and I was running. Then when he just about to TAKE ME, THEN I raise up. But in that fifth dimension you will have nightmare nightmare upper nightmare. But the difference you want to woke up that man running against behind you will catch you. [laughter] nightmare. &gt;&gt; He's not all together asleep. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; He's not okay together asleep and have a nightmare. Neither is he awake. He's between sleep. And that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming. because he's not asleep. He's not awake. And to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you die unconverted, you'll be stuck somewhere in the fifth dimension. The prophet says he has lived his time up. His time is finished here. He is dead on earth and he cannot go in the prisons of God because he's not FIT TO GO THERE without the blood. The blood is the life of God. The blood is the message of your hour. If you DON'T HAVE THE BLOOD, YOU WILL BE GET STUCK IN THAT FIFTH DIMENSION. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And his court cannot come back to earth because his time is finished here on earth. He's caught between and he's in a nightmare. You see, he can go in the presence of God to rest AND HE CAN'T GET BACK to earth because his time is up. He's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day OF THE JUDGMENT. A HORRIBLE THING TO BE IN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And now &gt;&gt; 26. And now &gt;&gt; in this vision, &gt;&gt; I believe I was caught into that sixth dimension. Looking back down here and could see back, see Besides &gt;&gt; is not exactly with the eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The sides is not with the eyes. &gt;&gt; That's earthly besides is a greater thing than THE contact is far BEYOND any contact that our natural senses will You know sometime we were talking with pastor about some supernatural things and we he he he was speaking about the pastor here in South Africa who is going far from him because he doesn't understand those things and I told him you know those things that you are experiencing is not for everybody. Only if you are supernatural, you can understand the supernatural. Some of us, even you, I know some of us and you and me and the pastor, we have some supernatural experience we cannot even EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE. MYSELF. I've been in some experiences when I explain to that people start to look at me differently. I don't want people to look at me differently. I'm your brother. Love me, please. You see when the prophet when his wife dies, sister Ma &gt;&gt; Sister Mida went back on the womb where the prophet was sleeping some who knows that just okay let me explain Sister went &gt;&gt; after he died in the bedroom and touched the prophet &gt;&gt; and spoke to him [laughter] and said you have to promise me you get married. Don't stay like this. you need a partner promise me and the prophet said no I cannot say no promise and then the prophet say I promise I will get married then she left and the prophet went to look for the light switch the light he said it was not a vision the prophet said it was not a VISION SHE WAS SO don't be afraid if someone told you that Pastor Kima visited me in the night. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; When I lost my mother, It was so painful. I was crying crying and one day I went to my bedroom. My wife was was not there and I cried because my mother left me. I was just 10 and she divorced with my father and he dies. She dies and I cried. And after that I finish crying &gt;&gt; and I go back to the living room and I stay there. I told it to anyone. Not even my wife knew that I was in that condition. Then in the night when I slept at around 5 a.m. my phone rings a sister of the church called me. She had no capacity of knowing nothing about what happened in the night. She said to me, "This night your mother come to my bedroom." She was there and she told me, "Tell your pastor to stop crying. I'm always with them in the house. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That's why I respect &gt;&gt; your message. The message you address it to your husband. I respect your spirituality. You know what you are talking about. I respect it. You know what you are talking about. You cannot be a wife on a man like pastor who don't have the same caliber. Let me let me go on and close. I still have two hours. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; when I was I was there I was wearing okay now &gt;&gt; there are three bodies let me give you something now you know the prophet says &gt;&gt; there are three different bodies the body that you are living with here a mortal body, a physical body. It's it's just for these three dimensions. &gt;&gt; You cannot change dimension and go with this body. Because every dimension has conditions changing dimension changing the bodies. That's why when you leave here, we'll take your bodies and we put it in a coffin and put it under under there. But you are not there because when this body is destroyed, we have another one. It's just dwelling places. The body we take when we go from here to the sixth dimension is called a celestial body. A celestial body is called also theophony. Theophony means a word body. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this body is celestial, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN TOUCH IT. YOU CAN FEEL IT. But it's different from this body. Amen. Amen. And then WHEN YOU COME BACK at the day of resurrection, you come back from the celestial body. Getting back here, you must mix that celestial body with the natural BODY to have what we call glorified body. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have three different bodies. The first one is a natural body. It's very limited. So weak and feeble. Yes. Amen. You do things and you regret after. But in your heart you say, "Oh, I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT. BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A NATURAL BODY. BUT I TELL YOU SOMETHING, one of these days, you're going to LEAVE THAT NATURAL BODY TO GET ANOTHER BODY changing dimension. Amen. And that celestial body when the prophet arrived there, people said to him, "With this celestial body, We cannot eat and sleep. So it's also limited TO THE PROPHET. WHEN JESUS COMES, he will come to you and then we shall RETURN TO earth changing the body so that we'll eat again.
