[17:51] him together with us together with
[17:55] brother gabrielson together with the
[17:59] others
[18:05] but because I'm coming to this
[18:08] and he is much on the threefold
[18:15] a revelation okay
[18:20] now you know you understand what is
[18:22] threefold
[18:25] oh
[18:27] but it says yeah

[18:45] revelation
[18:52] if you are also part of that you will
[18:54] say Amen
[18:58] okay
[19:00] all my soul rejoices in him
[19:05] this opens to me another place in
[19:09] Revelation
[19:11] a deeper responsibility with my Lord
[19:14] Jesus
[19:21] amen amen
[19:23] Amen to know as I was known
[19:27] he knew me
[19:30] yet he loved me
[19:33] He Who glorifies
[19:36] make
[19:37] their Heavens shine
[19:44] Muhammad
[19:47] a prophetic placing
[19:50] this is perfect
[19:52] putting me in the constellation with
[19:55] Christ Jesus
[19:58] so very wonderful in my heart
[20:03] thanks
[20:05] seven colors of the rainbow
[20:11] behold in the father's face
[20:14] foreign
[20:21] I must have
[20:23] known
[20:29] can you
[20:33] but his deeper plane is how he was love
[20:38] God is my friend too
[20:41] my dear brother
[20:46] we knew him each other
[20:50] foreign
[21:04] eternity awaits
[21:06] dear brother
[21:11] now
[21:12] that's why I went further
[21:17] to these threefold we are more a
[21:21] three-folding
[21:23] now we are going to see that uh the
[21:28] throne also is in three-fold
[21:33] and
[21:35] now we have here part that
[21:38] the prophet calls the final through
[21:45] as we have
[21:47] three fold
[21:50] fools yeah
[21:56] the first one you read Revelation
[21:58] chapter four
[22:03] oh shall we stand up and
[22:06] I don't know
[22:08] Revelation chapter four
[22:13] that's what verse 1 to 11.
[22:18] we want
[22:20] to read the whole part
[22:23] but it tells us off a throne that was
[22:26] said
[22:28] foreign
[22:37] [Music]
[22:45] after this I looked and behold a door
[22:49] was open in heaven and the first voice
[22:52] which I heard was as itway of a trumpet
[22:55] talking with me which said come up
[22:58] hither and I will show these things
[23:00] which must be here after
[23:02] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[23:05] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[23:08] one sat on the throne amen
[23:12] you remember we are coming to
[23:16] the throne Revelation chapter 5.
[23:21] meaning that a door
[23:26] the wait said come up here
[23:30] and I will show you things to come
[23:35] to come from where
[23:38] the door is open so that for to see the
[23:42] things to come okay
[23:47] amen
[23:48] and then
[23:50] it says here
[23:53] now uh
[23:57] that is
[23:58] the fruit number one
[24:00] firstly the door was opened
[24:04] as he said come come up
[24:09] I'll show you things too
[24:12] to come
[24:15] now for
[24:17] for us to see the things to come
[24:20] the door
[24:22] should be opened everybody
[24:27] and when the door was opened
[24:30] that's why today we are seeing things
[24:36] not of this world
[24:38] but things that came through the door
[24:41] they opened the door
[24:46] amen amen
[24:48] then
[24:50] second
[24:52] John John
[25:04] is it John
[25:07] 14. Johanna chapter 14. verse 8 to 10.
[25:11] tell us what
[25:13] what's on
[25:15] the scripture
[25:18] Philip said unto him Lord show us the
[25:22] father and it suffices us
[25:25] Jesus said unto him have I been so long
[25:29] time with you and yet has thou not known
[25:32] me Philip
[25:33] he that hath seen me has seen my father
[25:36] and how said thou then show us the
[25:39] father okay that one is taking us to
[25:43] this
[25:44] threefold
[25:50] he that
[25:51] see me
[25:54] see that
[25:57] he that has seen me
[25:59] has seen
[26:01] the father is putting you together
[26:05] if you have seen me
[26:08] you have seen the father
[26:13] and to see the father you should see me
[26:18] this is what
[26:20] he is saying
[26:22] the Lord Jesus Christ because it is
[26:25] coming
[26:26] down the three-fold
[26:31] if you see me you have seen the father
[26:37] it's it's one thing
[26:41] then
[26:44] but we come to this
[26:46] where
[26:50] where's the page
[26:52] more
[26:56] okay
[26:58] firstly
[27:01] let us ask
[27:05] baby just for a word of prayer because
[27:08] already we are reading the word of God
[27:13] but I'm looking for
[27:16] my patient
[27:19] speaking about the Third
[27:22] through
[27:25] it is somewhere just here
[27:29] oh yeah here my brother okay this year
[27:32] amen
[27:33] let me read this
[27:39] our Elder will read for us we will pray
[27:43] amen amen
[27:49] Revelation chapter 4 part two okay
[27:52] spoken with Revelation chapter four page
[27:55] 60 27.627.
[28:01] Glory raised from
[28:04] that Mercy Seat one day
[28:10] and it's settled on another Tabernacle
[28:14] later
[28:17] because it says the father judges no man
[28:21] but he has committed all judgment to the
[28:25] son
[28:29] you know it said on another
[28:33] foreign
[28:43] you speak against me
[28:46] it will be forgiven you
[28:52] and
[28:56] and the other one coming oh um
[29:00] that is another messy City
[29:04] you can speak against the son of man
[29:09] I will forgive you
[29:11] but someday
[29:15] the Holy Spirit Will come down to dwell
[29:19] in their hearts of their people
[29:25] one wait against it
[29:27] [Music]
[29:29] it will never be forgiven
[29:35] did you hear it
[29:38] okay
[29:39] only one word
[29:42] against it
[29:47] now he's running
[29:50] he was in the heavens
[29:53] above and shining in the stars
[29:59] the second
[30:01] was on Earth shining through the
[30:04] Shekinah Glory yeah
[30:10] next
[30:11] he come and was made flesh
[30:17] and dwell Among Us
[30:24] still wearing his patience
[30:28] he redeemed Man by his blood
[30:34] came into his church in the form of the
[30:36] Holy Ghost
[30:39] speaking against that
[30:43] is finished
[30:47] now you can see that here where
[30:52] there
[30:54] he says shaking come on
[30:59] time
[31:02] they don't realize people
[31:06] can't comprehend
[31:08] what it means now the first rule
[31:12] was in heaven
[31:16] judgment seats the second
[31:20] in Christ
[31:38] when he start to speak
[31:42] is from his throne
[31:47] then the next time you'll hear from
[31:51] the second throw
[31:54] then even to the final throw
[31:59] and that's all
[32:04] well
[32:06] foreign
[32:14] [Music]
[32:15] not advise you but let me say this
[32:21] there was as I used the word buddy
[32:27] now somebody challenged that and say the
[32:32] Bible says call no man father
[32:35] I said yes
[32:39] we were working
[32:42] um through the gate like that
[32:44] I said you have her father
[32:48] he said yes
[32:51] I said truly you have a father the Bible
[32:54] says no many fathers
[32:59] and how do you address your father
[33:02] he said
[33:04] father you are father
[33:07] I said but the Bible says call no man
[33:09] father
[33:12] amen then he was dizzy
[33:17] then I said brother before you try to
[33:21] interpret anything
[33:23] make sure you you you know
[33:28] Paul says I continue to say to him Paul
[33:33] says I am your
[33:37] guitar
[33:40] now what do you say and he said sorry
[33:42] sorry okay
[33:45] uh
[33:46] just a prayer for us
[33:53] let's explore here to entry
[33:58] gracious Lord
[34:00] it is through your grace that we are
[34:02] standing here this morning
[34:05] it is through your grace that our pastor
[34:09] has this revelation of a threefold
[34:13] it is through your grace father
[34:16] that today we are able to
[34:21] reach the revelation of this
[34:25] promises that you have given us
[34:28] father it's a promise
[34:30] that needs to be manifested
[34:34] and father we live in the day
[34:36] where we see
[34:38] the signs we live in the time where the
[34:42] signs are telling
[34:43] and the science will also Lord
[34:46] coordinate
[34:47] with your servant here on Earth Lord
[34:51] to see these things
[34:53] because you are the one that just
[34:56] made him a leader
[34:58] you are the one that has given a ship
[35:02] to lead
[35:04] and father you will be the one that will
[35:07] give him food so that
[35:09] we could be fed
[35:12] now we are saying to thee gracious Lord
[35:16] that we are really fed and we are so
[35:19] thankful
[35:20] father
[35:22] your way it says that you'll give us
[35:24] knowledge and understanding
[35:27] but gracious Lord you have even give us
[35:30] of the revelation of yourself
[35:32] and this revelation of yourself Lord
[35:35] encourse us
[35:38] we feel so encouraged gracious Heavenly
[35:40] Father we feel so blessed Lord when you
[35:44] revealed yourself
[35:46] gracious Heavenly Father it is the time
[35:49] now
[35:50] that whatever you have given us Lord
[35:53] manifest in US
[35:55] we'd like to thank you Father for giving
[35:58] us time to sit down
[36:02] and father Ponder upon this word
[36:05] and meditate upon these things that the
[36:08] pastor is preaching us
[36:10] and it gives us life Lord we are so
[36:13] jubilant Lord Almighty to be in this day
[36:17] the scriptures that have been read
[36:19] father
[36:20] needs to be expounded
[36:23] we are the one Lord Almighty that will
[36:25] expand it
[36:26] and we see
[36:28] how Lord Almighty you came down
[36:32] in this method gracious Heavenly Father
[36:35] moving from one Throne to to another
[36:39] Throne how you unfold yourself until
[36:43] father
[36:44] you we become yourself Lord
[36:47] we'd like to thank you Father for
[36:49] everything Lord take control once again
[36:52] Lord and bless us yes that we pray
[36:55] calling upon the precious name of our
[36:58] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[37:01] ah you may be seated God bless you okay
[37:11] it's so easy to find a church
[37:16] but
[37:18] it's difficult for people to find the
[37:21] throne
[37:22] [Music]
[37:25] it's so easy to hear about the king
[37:31] but to arrive at this Throne is
[37:34] something else
[37:38] amen amen
[37:40] amen no that's why I believe that
[37:46] to find a place for to worship with
[37:50] something else
[37:53] to find a change is something else
[37:57] but to find his throne
[38:00] it's something different
[38:05] all right amen
[38:08] and you know
[38:10] where the Prophet says
[38:12] the throne is can only be seen from the
[38:16] inside
[38:21] you don't you don't just look around
[38:23] foreign
[38:33] now the only way you can find a throne
[38:37] that is from
[38:39] foreign
[38:45] amen
[38:51] yeah
[38:53] now
[38:54] meaning that
[38:57] if you are a true worshiper 180
[39:00] you will find
[39:03] the FED through
[39:07] [Music]
[39:08] um
[39:09] yeah and that's what he's coming foreign
[39:15] and now we are going to
[39:18] look at these things
[39:22] all right I'll read the Bible
[39:25] Revelation chapter
[39:28] 4.
[39:34] let me try this oh the Bible
[39:50] sorry sorry brethren
[39:53] foreign
[40:02] no problem
[40:04] no problem brother
[40:15] God bless you here we go amen
[40:18] where's yours
[40:25] Revelation chapter four amen
[40:32] now I realize
[40:35] the Elder was talking about the Third
[40:38] the threefold okay
[40:45] then I looked back again
[40:50] for the threefold okay 340.
[40:55] which last time
[40:57] we went
[41:07] that was I think our title last the
[41:10] seventh seal is the end of
[41:12] office was it so now
[41:19] or was it song
[41:24] the title last time
[41:28] what was it like we really
[41:32] yes the end of the
[41:35] seventh
[41:37] seventh seal my friend yeah
[41:41] now only that year I was riding while
[41:44] talking here at home the the seventh
[41:47] seal is the end of all things it's still
[41:50] the same thing yeah
[41:56] and I'm going back to how it was
[42:01] foreign
[42:09] um I'm trying not to run okay
[42:13] let me find out
[42:15] okay
[42:19] it says yes from one of the books here
[42:22] oh yeah okay amen
[42:28] yeah I
[42:30] I believe you are not expecting like a
[42:34] fireworks you are expecting the way are
[42:37] they expected fireworks amen
[42:41] I can preach and run around
[42:46] top of the table
[42:49] but uh I haven't seen the Lord Jesus
[42:52] doing that
[42:54] yes and he will say to any through Stone
[42:58] and tell them about their Kingdom
[43:02] now I want us to look at the Kingdom
[43:07] amen amen
[43:10] now as certain as I stand in the
[43:14] platform tonight
[43:19] I had the Revelation that revealed
[43:26] it's in a three-fold manner
[43:33] okay I mean
[43:35] now three-fold
[43:40] puts you
[43:42] in that threefold
[43:45] you are part of the threefold
[43:49] so that when he speaks what happened
[43:53] is weird or the revelation
[43:59] flash through the threefold if it are
[44:03] more um
[44:05] those who will receive it
[44:08] are those that are in the free phones
[44:14] now it says
[44:18] you know if we go back
[44:21] Cod 14 years
[44:26] you listen because I'm going to take
[44:29] some few minutes
[44:32] and I'm gonna leave it there
[44:36] the message is over
[44:40] if you could understand that
[44:46] now if God created men in his own image
[44:50] in his own likeness
[44:54] what kind of man did he create
[45:02] now I
[45:04] I come here
[45:07] he was in other words Adam the first man
[45:11] in the lower creations of God now this
[45:14] is creation
[45:22] because you have Adam the body there
[45:26] but you have Adam
[45:29] who the spirit that was put into the
[45:33] body Adam
[45:39] we have read even last time that
[45:43] everything that was created has an end
[45:45] foreign
[46:04] that's why
[46:07] uh
[46:08] the last king
[46:11] we we have seen is
[46:18] he was the first king there with Abraham
[46:23] but Abraham met him when he was on his
[46:27] way
[46:28] to the city
[46:33] he was looking for the city
[46:38] now
[46:41] that's why even today because
[46:45] Abraham Abraham who was looking for a
[46:49] city
[46:52] he came to where he met the king
[46:56] of that City yeah
[47:02] we too lyric should come to where
[47:06] Abraham met the king thank you before
[47:13] we can enter the city amen
[47:18] now the seat of Abraham
[47:21] must find the place
[47:25] you know they must find this uh
[47:28] kimchio funny
[47:32] [Applause]
[47:33] the king without the beginning
[47:37] of days so
[47:46] in in his migration with his people
[47:51] it's end up that saying they met he met
[47:56] the king
[48:00] all right amen then it says here he met
[48:05] he he went up to where the city will
[48:09] come on
[48:13] he was still here on Earth
[48:15] but he came to the place
[48:20] where the city will come
[48:25] now he met Melchizedek
[48:28] and uh so now why because
[48:34] the other seed of the Seed of Abraham
[48:37] very Abraham
[48:39] was coming to the same place
[48:44] now like we we hear ourselves
[48:47] we come looking for a city
[48:55] all right now
[48:59] while looking for a city
[49:02] because this migration started with
[49:05] Abraham
[49:08] and all the Seed of Abraham
[49:11] was supposed at the end of time
[49:15] to come in the fold
[49:20] so that we will together what a little
[49:23] more be greeted in the city
[49:29] okay
[49:31] but we Too lyrics we come to a place
[49:37] where we meet the king
[49:44] did you understand when I read that last
[49:47] time
[49:50] that he is he is now a king
[49:54] or he is
[49:58] I don't know if you understood that is
[50:02] okay because the revelation of the
[50:06] seventh seals
[50:09] breaks the whole thing is
[50:16] which we will look at it
[50:19] right let me read here
[50:25] Adam the first man in the lower
[50:27] creations of God
[50:31] now we are talking about Adam
[50:37] the first creation was God himself
[50:42] but it is a creation that was not
[50:45] created
[50:48] then out of God
[50:51] came the logos what are logos
[50:55] which was the son of God
[50:57] then out of the logos which was the word
[51:06] and the way it was with God
[51:09] amen amen now you are going back
[51:13] in the beginning was the word now you
[51:17] are going back the word was with God
[51:21] you can't go forward with that you must
[51:25] go backwards
[51:27] the word was with God
[51:30] and then you must go back
[51:33] and the way it was
[51:36] you can run forward with that you always
[51:39] going back
[51:43] amen amen where it started
[51:47] and the Word was was God
[51:53] all right now
[51:56] uh the logos which was the son of God
[51:59] then out of the logos which was the
[52:01] weight in the beginning was the weight
[52:03] and the weight was with God and the
[52:06] weight was God and the weight was made
[52:08] flesh and dwell Among Us amen now out of
[52:11] the logos
[52:12] came forth the men
[52:17] amen amen saw a
[52:22] brother memes was talking to me last
[52:25] time
[52:27] the logos men logos
[52:33] you know you are a man yeah
[52:36] um
[52:38] but it depends whether you are the logos
[52:41] man
[52:47] the Bible says flesh shall not inherit
[52:50] the kingdom of God
[52:52] flesh and blood
[52:55] amen so the logos men in their body
[53:01] all right amen but now the seven the
[53:06] seventh sea let let's read it and close
[53:09] the revelation of the seventh sale
[53:16] it's not a church play
[53:20] that's why I don't belong to any church
[53:23] I belong to Christ
[53:27] you should not belong to a church
[53:31] because
[53:35] churches have God's spirits
[53:40] that's right amen amen now we should
[53:43] belong to Christ to Christ
[53:48] let me leave it there for a bit
[53:52] for a while
[53:54] I'm going back to this
[53:58] now as certain as I stand in the
[54:01] platform
[54:05] you know sometimes you are you are
[54:07] talking you are talking to the man the
[54:09] flesh
[54:12] you come for the second time in trying
[54:15] to talk to the soul
[54:20] you ask many people have you heard the
[54:23] message today
[54:25] he says yes yes brother
[54:28] but that would be only in flesh
[54:33] but you come again have you heard the
[54:35] message
[54:40] and uh you'll see whether yes is the
[54:44] flesh or it is the inner men
[54:52] now let me read to you again I don't
[54:55] know the first time whether it dropped
[54:58] in a flesh or in the soul
[55:02] and now as certain as I stand in the
[55:06] platform
[55:08] he said that that he said tonight
[55:14] I I heard the Revelation that revealed
[55:22] now you have your already I've read to
[55:25] you the three folders threefold
[55:30] let's read let's go back to that
[55:32] three-fold
[55:34] in the creation after it says
[55:40] out of the of God came the logos
[55:44] which was the son of God
[55:47] then out of the logos
[55:49] which was the word in the beginning
[55:57] then out of the logos
[56:12] [Music]
[56:16] where's my Bible
[56:19] amen
[56:21] look at this here John chapter 14 John
[56:24] 14.
[56:26] um
[56:30] how many have fallen asleep
[56:40] John 14.
[56:43] verse now let's start here
[56:47] verse 7. if he had known me
[56:51] you should have known my father
[56:55] also yeah
[56:58] do you hear what he's saying
[57:02] now if you have that is still that is
[57:06] threefold it's only threefold the
[57:08] elephant if you have known me
[57:11] you should also have known my father
[57:17] right Amen Let con let's continue that
[57:22] is verse 7.
[57:24] verse seven if you have known me you
[57:28] should have known my father also and
[57:32] from henceforth you know him
[57:40] it does apply in the threefold
[57:44] but hence
[57:48] you have
[57:50] known me
[57:52] listen if it were you brother that day
[57:57] the Lord Jesus saying to you you have
[58:00] known me
[58:02] on TV amen amen and he says or he
[58:08] continued from henceforth
[58:13] uh
[58:25] he is applying the threefold
[58:32] and and from henceforth
[58:36] well you have known him
[58:39] and they have seen him
[58:44] you know you have known him
[58:47] brings them
[58:50] in their food
[58:55] if you know me if you have known me then
[59:00] you have known my father
[59:01] this is actually what he is saying
[59:07] because it is applied in a three-fold
[59:15] all right
[59:17] that's why he says he that has seen me
[59:21] has seen the father
[59:24] it is working through the three four
[59:27] three four three four
[59:29] you can't say you have seen him but we
[59:33] haven't seen the father it is not
[59:36] threefold I be threefold
[59:39] amen
[59:41] now that's how God has put it to be in
[59:46] that form
[59:48] threefold
[59:50] if he says something it is applied
[59:54] through throughout the threefolding
[1:00:01] it is said by you
[1:00:04] if it is said by the sun it is
[1:00:13] uh-huh
[1:00:15] because it is even applied from the
[1:00:17] threefold
[1:00:19] that's why
[1:00:22] the world the people so confused because
[1:00:31] if I am not part of the threefold
[1:00:35] I'll keep on saying
[1:00:37] it was not it is not revealed
[1:00:40] until to the end it is not available
[1:00:59] now he continues to say
[1:01:03] um
[1:01:06] what was it where was that
[1:01:10] let's start here
[1:01:13] verse 3. and if I go and prepare a place
[1:01:19] for you I will come again and receive
[1:01:24] you unto myself
[1:01:28] literally
[1:01:29] okay
[1:01:35] unto myself because you are part of
[1:01:39] the threefolds
[1:01:43] now he can leave you behind him
[1:01:47] threefold River it's a great revelation
[1:01:52] I will
[1:01:54] I will receive you come he can't leave
[1:01:58] his threefold his part
[1:02:03] okay then you continue I will come again
[1:02:08] and receive you unto myself myself
[1:02:15] it doesn't say my room or my house
[1:02:18] myself
[1:02:23] because you should be you are part of
[1:02:27] myself
[1:02:33] that where I am
[1:02:39] you
[1:02:41] there he may be also
[1:02:45] you must be where I am living

[1:03:20] where I go
[1:03:22] you know
[1:03:25] he didn't say you will know
[1:03:31] you know
[1:03:33] because and
[1:03:37] the way you know listen yeah it's he
[1:03:43] who
[1:03:46] if you don't know you are going to keep
[1:03:48] quiet here
[1:03:50] the way you know
[1:03:53] Thomas said Thomas unto him
[1:03:57] you know he is he is talking
[1:04:01] to the three foods
[1:04:05] that is himself in a three-fold
[1:04:10] he says where I go we are also going you
[1:04:14] know
[1:04:17] where I am
[1:04:21] that's right
[1:04:23] here
[1:04:26] where I am now
[1:04:30] fine Best Buy
[1:04:34] uh verse 5 Thomas said unto him Lord we
[1:04:38] know not where thou goal is you know
[1:04:41] contradiction now and how can we know
[1:04:44] the way
[1:04:50] and Jesus said unto him
[1:04:53] I am
[1:04:55] the way amen
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:00] you don't need a map
[1:05:05] or what do you call you using your card
[1:05:08] yes you don't need that Thomas I also
[1:05:12] okay so we're not Thomas no you only
[1:05:14] need to be part of me
[1:05:20] I am the way cannot feel I mean you
[1:05:25] don't need to learn about it you don't
[1:05:28] need to go to Bible school
[1:05:33] now for you to know the way that's when
[1:05:36] you are part of me
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:43] all right
[1:05:45] this
[1:05:49] hey
[1:05:51] he puzzled Thomas
[1:05:53] where I go you know
[1:05:57] and the way let's see you know
[1:06:01] he is talking
[1:06:05] to the entire three-fold
[1:06:10] if he's going that way
[1:06:14] he is going that way
[1:06:16] in a three-fold
[1:06:19] so Thomas you know Thomas was he
[1:06:24] this
[1:06:26] six amen
[1:06:28] Jesus said unto him that's why I am the
[1:06:33] way
[1:06:34] he didn't say I have the way
[1:06:41] are you in the service amen he didn't
[1:06:44] say I have the way
[1:06:51] I may
[1:06:53] we are not looking for his ways
[1:06:57] we are part of his way
[1:07:04] all right amen
[1:07:07] I am the way see like in the truth
[1:07:11] literature
[1:07:15] somebody saying uh you know I'm looking
[1:07:17] for a church that speaks the truth
[1:07:21] no you won't find it okay wait
[1:07:25] you'll only know the truth if you are
[1:07:27] part of
[1:07:34] he says end their life
[1:07:37] I am good not I have it's already
[1:07:45] I'm the way
[1:07:46] Godzilla
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:49] I am the way the truth
[1:07:53] amen amen
[1:07:56] don't don't try to tell the truth
[1:08:01] but you should be the truth
[1:08:08] that's why some people
[1:08:10] he will tell the truth there
[1:08:13] and there you will tell lies
[1:08:17] trying to escape through and so forth
[1:08:21] but actually
[1:08:23] you should be the truth
[1:08:28] you should be the word
[1:08:30] as the the prophet of God says amen
[1:08:40] if the husband is the wage
[1:08:46] is the way killing amen
[1:08:50] otherwise
[1:08:52] there won't be any agreement in the
[1:08:55] family
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:15] the word Angel if it's the way the body
[1:09:20] should be the way
[1:09:21] Evie is the truth the body should be the
[1:09:25] truth amen
[1:09:28] his entire body is the truth
[1:09:32] amen amen that's why I didn't say
[1:09:36] I have
[1:09:38] the truth
[1:09:42] no that will take you to Bible School
[1:09:46] this
[1:09:50] I am the way the truth and the life no
[1:09:54] man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:10:03] amen there's no other way
[1:10:09] by me
[1:10:11] that's when you are part of him
[1:10:16] right amen you can't train him
[1:10:21] you are part of him
[1:10:25] did you know that you can't train this
[1:10:28] message
[1:10:32] that's why after draining
[1:10:36] next time
[1:10:39] you'll find it faulty
[1:10:43] and say
[1:10:46] the reason
[1:10:48] I'm leaving this message
[1:10:50] because you have never never believed
[1:10:55] the message
[1:10:58] I mean you have drained a church into
[1:11:02] integrate
[1:11:04] now if you say we are Glory
[1:11:08] because this message he said behold I'll
[1:11:12] send you Elijah the prophets
[1:11:17] you can drain that Prophet okay
[1:11:20] because if you join him later he'll call
[1:11:24] him a cult
[1:11:28] that will be your nature showing
[1:11:33] amen amen you can't join him you can't
[1:11:37] join God
[1:11:40] all right now the people come and live
[1:11:44] come and live come here because they
[1:11:47] join me they are not part of it
[1:11:54] show me one person
[1:11:57] after saying the reason I left
[1:12:02] and you look at that person and now you
[1:12:05] see God
[1:12:09] foreign
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:19] that's the reason
[1:12:23] the reason she left
[1:12:28] it is because she couldn't do her thing
[1:12:33] I've never
[1:12:35] called somebody's name
[1:12:40] I'm talking about the nature of things
[1:12:52] you won't go far with God because that's
[1:12:56] against your nature
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:04] the nature of God is holiness
[1:13:13] all right
[1:13:15] now
[1:13:16] this
[1:13:18] seven I mean if he had known me listen

[1:19:05] each and everyone
[1:19:08] could recognize
[1:19:10] even in the church
[1:19:13] it is just like that
[1:19:18] as there was one who said we must help
[1:19:20] the parts stop because he's not educated
[1:19:28] can that be my pastor

[1:19:35] educated

[1:19:43] a sheep coming to the pasta
[1:19:46] saying since you are not dedicated
[1:19:52] do you call that a pasta
[1:19:57] past Tyson was not made through
[1:19:59] education
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:06] you find a high
[1:20:09] pasta and I'll tell you you listen to
[1:20:11] this man listen to him you hear things
[1:20:21] he hasn't a God and that said the Lord
[1:20:26] because he says you know according to my
[1:20:29] according to myself
[1:20:31] amen I studied this in England you know
[1:20:35] I studied bch and you know yes
[1:20:42] God that is your educated
[1:20:46] but you find the real Pastor it
[1:20:52] is
[1:21:01] I'm trying to read this
[1:21:05] Philip
[1:21:06] Philip he that has seen me has
[1:21:11] sin not will sin the father it's also of
[1:21:15] one attack no he that has seen
[1:21:19] have seen the father
[1:21:23] yay this language
[1:21:26] it puts you in you know in a threefold
[1:21:31] and now
[1:21:34] and how says that then show us the
[1:21:40] father
[1:21:42] these things were happening because
[1:21:44] their Holy Ghost had not not yet come on
[1:21:51] because after the holy ghosts
[1:21:58] all right because he was part of it
[1:22:04] houses
[1:22:10] you know this day the day of John 14 it
[1:22:15] was a tough day
[1:22:19] for Christ and his followers
[1:22:26] foreign
[1:22:57] foreign
[1:23:06] what do you mean
[1:23:08] okay I think if somebody was there
[1:23:15] somebody who was just a visitor he would
[1:23:19] go home and say hey that church is tough
[1:23:23] that system is tough system
[1:23:27] they're the leader with some questions
[1:23:33] and he's trying to put it to them
[1:23:38] you know yeah
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:42] yeah it was a tough day
[1:23:48] like this day of the seventh seeds
[1:23:57] among that's why I don't belong to a
[1:24:00] message
[1:24:03] no we do not belong to the message
[1:24:11] churches have got some spirits
[1:24:15] men you should belong to Christ
[1:24:21] amen not to
[1:24:23] what do you call the message
[1:24:31] right I'm finishing capitalism
[1:24:35] uh I think
[1:24:38] was Philip the last one
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:46] why how come you say show us the father
[1:24:52] you've been part of it
[1:24:56] but the Lord knew that when the Holy
[1:24:59] Ghost shall come upon them
[1:25:01] then they will know amen
[1:25:07] Believers doubt not that I am in my
[1:25:10] father and the father in me
[1:25:14] um
[1:25:19] right amen
[1:25:22] foreign
[1:25:31] belief
[1:25:33] but at that time because the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] had not yet come on
[1:25:38] he kept on talking about
[1:25:41] my father and me
[1:25:44] I am my father
[1:25:48] was it diverse
[1:25:50] City where he says I I don't know I

[1:32:49] it was something sort of an anointing
[1:32:53] approach otherwise you can mix these

[1:33:01] one day
[1:33:04] that day
[1:33:08] it is coming yeah
[1:33:13] but
[1:33:17] foreign
[1:33:49] what
[1:33:50] now it depends one is still
[1:33:56] venturing in that day
[1:34:00] where it was not yet made known
[1:34:03] and the other one is inside
[1:34:07] where
[1:34:09] he says that you shall know
[1:34:15] amen

[1:34:41] at that day I believe
[1:34:45] it's not talking about believing or I
[1:34:49] believe what is talking about being
[1:34:51] inside
[1:34:53] that's why in the book and reading of
[1:34:56] God
[1:34:57] he speaks of the foreign
[1:35:04] in the book
[1:35:06] um
[1:35:08] he says
[1:35:10] the Throne of God can only be seen from
[1:35:15] the inside
[1:35:17] amen that's why in the New Jerusalem
[1:35:21] the body there is the bride of Christ
[1:35:26] and then top there is late
[1:35:30] matomo

[1:36:35] she is The Insider amen
[1:36:37] [Music]

[1:36:46] the inside amen
[1:36:49] [Applause]
[1:36:52] foreign fella
[1:37:03] in the threefold more threefold
[1:37:07] now if you are part of the threefold

[1:37:17] at that day
[1:37:19] you shall no no no
[1:37:24] who amen
[1:37:27] are you looking at the two things
[1:37:31] the first one says but off that day
[1:37:41] but this one says
[1:37:53] that I am in my father
[1:38:00] where is it amen
[1:38:03] where is it amen
[1:38:05] John 14 20. amen at that day
[1:38:11] you shall know because see that now you

[1:38:28] will come through or whatever
[1:38:32] now you he's talking to a particular
[1:38:37] person or to some people
[1:38:42] over my G
[1:38:45] at the at that day not off that day
[1:38:49] you shall know that
[1:38:52] I am in my father
[1:38:56] you in me
[1:39:00] and I in you then
[1:39:05] he called it three
[1:39:07] foreign

[1:39:58] threefold a person that's part of the
[1:40:02] threefold
[1:40:07] God said let there be light I always see

[1:40:19] didn't hear you can follow you did you
[1:40:21] say

[1:40:29] because
[1:40:30] if he speaks that light is a
[1:40:34] manifestation no
[1:40:40] light cannot question him
[1:40:43] and say maybe you did it too early
[1:40:47] no it's part of him

[1:47:55] uh it was not only sent to the prophet
[1:47:59] Affair amen
[1:48:02] if he says
[1:48:04] behold I will send unto you
[1:48:08] he's sending those that message to you
[1:48:12] but packaged into output change I'm a

[1:48:27] me
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] is that right
[1:48:33] now you must keep that package with you
[1:48:37] until it is the day of the opening
[1:48:42] all right
[1:48:45] you know last we have read about this
[1:48:50] but when I was there just taking a nap
[1:48:56] it came back
[1:48:58] say have you considered this
[1:49:01] it's not one scripture
[1:49:07] before the sales
[1:49:11] the Angels do but of that day even the
[1:49:16] angels don't know
[1:49:17] that is before the
[1:49:20] foreign
[1:49:55] it differently at that day you shall no
[1:50:00] no no
[1:50:01] now you know at that day
[1:50:05] that worry
[1:50:07] I am in my father
[1:50:11] and you Lena
[1:50:14] can you say not me brothers
[1:50:22] because it says
[1:50:25] I am in my father
[1:50:28] and you Lena in me
[1:50:33] amen
[1:50:43] no
[1:50:44] in closing
[1:50:48] I heard the Revelation that revealed
[1:50:50] it's in a three four three four okay no
[1:50:55] I must now stop here for a I can
[1:50:59] continue we'll see it
[1:51:02] do you notice
[1:51:05] on the opening of the seventh seal
[1:51:11] it's also in
[1:51:14] threefold
[1:51:17] let me ask what does it mean it it's in
[1:51:21] a threefold
[1:51:23] meaning that
[1:51:26] if hey you are part of the threefolds
[1:51:33] only the threefold okay threefold will
[1:51:36] know about this Revelation
[1:51:39] amen amen
[1:51:44] that's why John 14 says the way you know
[1:51:49] even before they received the Holy Ghost
[1:51:53] he said
[1:51:58] amen where I am going you know
[1:52:01] amen amen
[1:52:04] didn't he say the same thing to you
[1:52:10] the way you know
[1:52:13] the Revelation you know
[1:52:15] you know what is the seventh sin wow
[1:52:21] if you don't know you say no it is not
[1:52:25] revealed yes to you
[1:52:28] but to the threefold
[1:52:32] it is revealed the members I believe I'm
[1:52:38] in the threefold
[1:52:41] so it drops right in there
[1:52:45] like in a constellation
[1:52:48] that's why the prophet
[1:52:52] uh a state of God saying when a lot of
[1:52:55] money taking him through some classes
[1:52:58] he puts him in the
[1:53:01] constellations
[1:53:04] when he comes out of the constellation
[1:53:07] he comes with a message
[1:53:16] as we take our children to school
[1:53:21] into that
[1:53:23] academic course delusion
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:29] you expect to help him to come back with
[1:53:32] something
[1:53:35] is that right now who's right I mean
[1:53:39] God also he has to take his children
[1:53:44] the Prophet The Prophet was put in the
[1:53:47] in a constellation
[1:53:52] coming up people still don't believe it
[1:53:55] but
