[40:55] that day shall not come except there
[40:58] come a fooling away first
[41:03] I mean I mean
[41:04] and
[41:07] and that that man of sin be revealed
[41:13] amen the Son of Perdition amen that
[41:19] right who opposes and exalts himself
[41:22] above all that's called God
[41:26] is it not happening yes
[41:31] some saying I know better than God

[43:44] he will only be revealed after the bride
[43:48] is taken away
[43:54] he is
[43:59] doing his things already
[44:02] but there's something
[44:06] my
[44:11] only after the bride
[44:14] is taken away
[44:16] then this man of sins amen
[44:25] meaning that he can't do that while the

[45:29] Even in our age
[45:32] it says
[45:34] there is twins
[45:40] you know twins
[45:45] they may look alike yeah
[45:49] as twins
[45:52] amen amen
[45:54] but
[45:55] with two different natures
[46:03] we had born as twins
[46:08] then the other one
[46:10] hated to the other ones
[46:16] twins
[46:25] nature
[46:30] each had a father
[46:34] but fella

[46:45] but two different fans
[46:51] all right
[46:53] now the true bread of Christ
[46:56] has been elected
[46:59] out of every church
[47:03] because twins
[47:12] no that's why
[47:15] they were supposed to be
[47:19] we were supposed to see the election
[47:26] it has already happened
[47:31] the Nature's
[47:33] different Natures
[47:35] in
[47:37] the same church
[47:39] but with different natures
[47:45] amen amen and
[47:48] no
[47:50] she did true bride

[48:17] prophet speaking here
[48:21] amen amen so God bless you
[48:24] now we were looking also
[48:28] what we are looking at now
[48:32] um
[48:34] foreign
[49:02] there are people who
[49:05] are
[49:06] waiting for Satan
[49:11] they sold they are sold
[49:16] hey
[49:23] who will escape
[49:29] that is coming
[49:35] you must thank God
[49:39] for you early his child
[49:42] um
[49:43] I mean
[49:48] have you ever seen the wrath of God
[49:54] that's why it says
[50:00] Revelation chapter 10.
[50:02] chapter 7 verse 10 7 verse 10.
[50:07] Revelation chapter
[50:09] 12. you know the word
[50:14] um
[50:19] therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that
[50:22] dwell in them woo to the inhabitants of
[50:25] the earth and of the sea for the Devil
[50:28] is come down unto you having great rest
[50:30] because he knoweth that he had but a
[50:33] short time uh
[50:36] the Inhibitors of Heaven
[50:39] or of the earth and the Sea Island
[50:47] you know these people
[50:50] they are citizens of inhabitants of the
[50:54] earth and the sea
[50:56] look you are here brother
[51:00] but what is that in your cell phone yeah
[51:08] showing that you are not a Christian

[51:56] they brought me
[51:57] the brother was saying
[52:03] he says okay
[52:05] okay he is repenting
[52:10] now the question is is
[52:14] no
[52:16] the answer is
[52:21] cell phones of the young people
[52:26] carrying another Ministry
[52:30] which is not of God
[52:34] all right
[52:37] okay let's go there now amen

[52:44] will see
[52:47] is God and a man
[52:50] [Music]
[52:52] remote
[52:55] that's that's all who let us read this
[52:59] out of
[53:01] the Bible
[53:04] because in the book of
[53:07] Christ is the mystery of God reveals
[53:09] Christ is the mystery of God revealed I
[53:13] love this book so much
[53:17] earn
[53:19] Christ

[53:25] mystery discipline of God reveals
[53:32] because Christ is the anointed
[53:37] Jesus is his ethnic name
[53:44] but like brother Brandon says
[53:51] she was waiting all the annotate as she
[53:55] went around saying
[54:03] do we know something that the Rapture is
[54:05] coming
[54:10] I'm not talking about knowledge
[54:12] [Music]
[54:14] I'm talking about uh being part of it

[54:28] rapturing footings
[54:35] yeah on the runway really more Runway
[54:41] I'm waiting for Brother
[54:44] Elder gay person

[55:04] questions
[55:06] for some things that I don't understand

[55:16] we are now on the runway
[55:24] now as you know
[55:26] a flying machine is not like a taxi is
[55:34] once it has taken off
[55:37] which is off
[55:42] now we as the children of God
[55:47] once he fella
[55:50] we take off then we are we are gone
[55:57] as we used to sing I have decided to
[55:59] follow Jesus
[56:10] what have you decided to
[56:14] become a church member
[56:18] or are you on the runway Runway
[56:22] the people on the runway
[56:28] you know we can go back
[56:30] we find
[56:32] men like Elijah
[56:39] let's go to this man
[56:42] when he was about to be taken up here
[56:47] he started to walk towards
[56:52] they're coming chariots
[57:00] we will understand
[57:04] the same experience foreign
[57:29] foreign
[57:58] working with God
[58:01] is that right
[58:03] so we are going to see the people
[58:06] who have already started to work
[58:12] oh man
[58:14] beautiful Hallelujah yes why
[58:18] it's already in them
[58:20] [Music]
[58:23] they are thinking of nothing else but
[58:25] the rapture
[58:29] they are not looking back
[58:31] they are on the runway
[58:38] once it has taken off
[58:44] okay I mean
[58:46] I don't know how many this morning
[58:54] [Applause]
[58:56] not turning back
[58:59] the engine is roaring already
[59:07] this is what we are looking at
[59:11] now I'm going to read only a few things
[59:17] now
[59:20] [Music]
[59:20] um
[59:22] let me go back to this
[59:26] the summer written woman
[59:29] brother Brendan says
[59:32] all this time she was going around
[59:38] talking about it the Messiah now that
[59:43] thing he said I know
[59:50] as the prophet says
[59:53] Christ today
[59:55] has been made
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:01] I'm not I'm not saying Jesus
[1:00:05] I'm saying Christ
[1:00:07] the anointed
[1:00:10] has been made
[1:00:14] now to be made
[1:00:16] is when it's not when somebody reads it
[1:00:20] out
[1:00:22] and say Christ is
[1:00:26] when it is in you
[1:00:31] he is made known to you there
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:42] and there's a sister she walked out
[1:00:45] there
[1:00:48] I wonder if she has any problems
[1:00:54] no
[1:00:56] you haven't seen the sister sister she
[1:01:00] walked out there
[1:01:05] you haven't seen it no no I have not
[1:01:07] noticed that okay
[1:01:10] all right
[1:01:14] because
[1:01:18] what is happening
[1:01:23] if every time we come together
[1:01:27] the devil also
[1:01:30] all right
[1:01:35] but if do we fear Him no please
[1:01:42] I
[1:01:44] mean
[1:01:46] we don't fear Him right amen we are here
[1:01:49] to worship
[1:01:58] here we are
[1:02:00] now let's look at his identification
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:07] because if you are going in the Rapture
[1:02:11] he has to identify himself
[1:02:16] with you now
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:23] he has already identified himself with
[1:02:26] us
[1:02:28] by saying I am here now
[1:02:35] for
[1:02:37] our journey
[1:02:41] when he identified himself to enock
[1:02:46] Enoch started to walk
[1:02:49] the Bible says he walked with God
[1:02:54] I believe there's some people today that
[1:02:58] are working with God
[1:03:05] they are looking they are no longer
[1:03:07] looking back
[1:03:10] nothing can stop them
[1:03:13] they are already on the runway
[1:03:20] and no turning back
[1:03:25] you know I was looking at the sitting
[1:03:28] thing that brother brother Branham spoke
[1:03:31] of
[1:03:32] electricity
[1:03:35] speaking about the revelation
[1:03:40] and only I don't have it here today
[1:03:45] the revelation of what it was
[1:03:50] a
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:54] we have read that everybody remember
[1:03:56] amen the revelation of what it was
[1:04:05] you know it puts you off the things of
[1:04:08] the world
[1:04:12] if you see the Revelation
[1:04:14] what it was
[1:04:17] done you have the revelation
[1:04:20] of where you come from
[1:04:24] who are you to begin with
[1:04:28] where you come from where are you going
[1:04:36] otherwise
[1:04:38] it is just there Merry Go Round
[1:04:45] you know if you can say to a person
[1:04:49] walk around about this building
[1:04:54] do you know that now what's wrong you
[1:04:56] will get tired
[1:04:59] mm-hmm I mean
[1:05:01] I mean and for me to come to church
[1:05:05] again and go back and come to church
[1:05:11] just like that then I know that yeah
[1:05:16] I have to come back to church next
[1:05:18] Sunday again
[1:05:24] that is
[1:05:35] and come to church
[1:05:39] thank you
[1:05:41] and do his things
[1:05:50] but he can do anything
[1:05:55] I'm not talking about that kind of thing
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:03] to me
[1:06:04] with you Lil Wayne
[1:06:07] coming here
[1:06:09] is a step forward
[1:06:12] foreign
[1:06:14] [Applause]
[1:06:19] I
[1:06:20] it's not a merry go around
[1:06:25] that like a a person
[1:06:31] he goes to church
[1:06:34] just the same as he went to church last
[1:06:37] week
[1:06:39] nothing changing
[1:06:43] nothing new it's just a routine
[1:06:52] I'm talking to an individual

[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:35] you as a Christian
[1:07:39] have Christ identified himself
[1:07:50] because before you can worship Him
[1:07:57] awesome
[1:07:59] you must be identified
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:04] and when you are identified
[1:08:07] that's when he is identified
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:13] then you can see
[1:08:17] me and God
[1:08:20] working together
[1:08:24] talking about eternal life
[1:08:27] you are talking about the life
[1:08:30] that will never cease
[1:08:34] nothing can disappoint that life
[1:08:38] nothing can stop that life
[1:08:47] you don't come to the end
[1:08:53] as you are working
[1:08:55] you are gradually
[1:08:57] getting out of this boat
[1:09:13] yeah yeah
[1:09:16] yeah
[1:09:16] they were saying everybody

[1:16:00] is coming here
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:07] like a friend of mine
[1:16:11] I think I mentioned this
[1:16:14] he was coming down in mamelodi here
[1:16:18] alongside the graveyards
[1:16:22] now he came to to my house
[1:16:28] I was just passing there they gave
[1:16:31] Graves
[1:16:36] it was flooded by some thoughts
[1:16:41] do the people in mamelodi
[1:16:46] have they seen this graveyard
[1:16:52] so that was that a young man
[1:16:54] [Music]

[1:18:18] you're seeing him struggling even
[1:18:20] standing here
[1:18:26] [Applause]

[1:21:17] that even when you are alone
[1:21:19] you can talk to him
[1:21:25] I'm not talking just about the Mere

[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:56] foreign
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:27] then it is
[1:22:31] that right amen
[1:22:34] now the way the way he came the Lord
[1:22:36] Jesus Christ
[1:22:39] and
[1:22:43] logos yeah
[1:22:49] all right
[1:22:51] now it differ
[1:22:53] it is different
[1:22:57] from if you counter from
[1:23:01] if
[1:23:03] back there whoever
[1:23:06] um a child coming forward
[1:23:11] through actually
[1:23:16] sexual

[1:23:32] the rainbow
[1:23:34] um
[1:23:39] was prepared for you foreign
[1:23:44] body fella
[1:23:45] the soul the soldier the life

[1:24:00] no way now if you come in
[1:24:04] everybody will see that
[1:24:07] our neighbor in here is a different
[1:24:10] person

[1:24:34] we will see him I'm preaching now yeah
[1:24:37] and I'm serious

[1:24:42] they will go after their own time
[1:24:46] that young man she has things
