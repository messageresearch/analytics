[53:29] leaveth and believeth in
[53:32] me shall never
[53:36] die now Jesus is asking Mara believe
[53:40] thou
[53:46] this when responded she said she said
[53:50] unto
[53:51] him yeah
[53:53] Lord I believe that
[53:56] Thou Art the
[53:58] Christ the son of God which should come
[54:01] into the
[54:05] world in my heart there's this thing
[54:08] that God has
[54:10] placed that are you
[54:14] believing believe as that that Jesus is
[54:18] saying because
[54:22] everything it is based on whether Jesus
[54:25] is finding a place in the human
[54:31] heart our mother has traveled her
[54:35] journey she has completed her
[54:41] journey the ministry that was in here or
[54:44] the
[54:46] faith has made her that
[54:50] today that even when we are
[54:54] crying but we cry but having an
[54:58] understanding that wherever she
[55:01] is she is in Everlasting Joy hallelujah
[55:06] amen he said the pastor
[55:09] yesterday that she is now in the sixth
[55:11] Dimension hallelujah
[55:14] amen where we are not growing
[55:18] up where we are in the same same
[55:22] age where we remain Young
[55:26] he said in
[55:28] heaven we will have a youth
[55:33] service amen there is no service for the
[55:36] elderly even
[55:39] Jesus his
[55:41] ministry it was a
[55:44] Ministry which arrived at the age where
[55:47] he
[55:48] was3 at the age of 33
[55:51] years he couldn't go past that age wait
[55:57] so that we can reach our home hallelujah
[56:01] amen but the Bible is saying do you
[56:03] believe
[56:07] that because
[56:09] everything is based on whether you
[56:11] believe hallelujah
[56:15] amen he says when he speak
[56:18] here M verse
[56:23] 24
[56:25] Jesus is saying Jesus said unto
[56:28] her brother shall rise
[56:33] again said I know that he shall rise
[56:37] again in the resurrection at the
[56:44] last had the
[56:48] knowledge his brother shall
[56:51] resurrect during the day of Resurrection
[56:55] but now Jesus is saying I love
[57:01] Jesus wasn't
[57:04] wrong but she didn't have the
[57:08] Revelation that for Jesus to be present
[57:11] yes there is a resurrection
[57:14] yes Hallelujah but there is a
[57:17] resurrection
[57:23] also she was talking about the
[57:27] resurrection he was talking about the
[57:29] current
[57:30] resurrection of
[57:32] Lazarus
[57:34] amen Jesus
[57:37] said I am the
[57:40] resurrection hallelujah
[57:43] amen I am the
[57:48] life do you believe
[57:51] that hallelujah amen
[57:56] I know there is a but
[57:59] now the one standing in front of you he
[58:03] is the
[58:05] resurrection
[58:08] am
[58:10] now what God is saying
[58:13] here that we need to
[58:17] believe that during this
[58:22] time there are things that God wants to
[58:25] raise in the lives of the children
[58:28] children of God
[58:32] Amen but what is
[58:36] important many people live their
[58:39] lives but Jesus is saying I am the
[58:43] resurrection and
[58:46] life in other
[58:48] words there is your
[58:50] life and there is the life of
[58:53] God
[58:55] amen now in your
[58:59] life life sometime get mixed
[59:04] up and end up deciding to take your own
[59:09] life because there is no direction in
[59:12] your
[59:13] life it is because it is
[59:17] yours if you have your own
[59:23] life
[59:25] if your life the owner of the life is
[59:28] not
[59:29] present then your life will be messed up
[59:33] but now Jesus is saying to
[59:36] today your brother shall
[59:39] resurrect in other words
[59:43] today Jesus can change
[59:46] things
[59:48] today Jesus can turn the cry
[59:53] because he arrived as the
[59:56] resurrection and he is the
[59:59] life but so that that can
[1:00:02] happen he's not only coming to
[1:00:06] you but now he comes to you also with
[1:00:09] his
[1:00:12] nature because our
[1:00:15] nature it must
[1:00:18] end so that his nature
[1:00:21] can because his
[1:00:23] nature he has eternal
[1:00:31] life the time that we are
[1:00:34] living we are living in a
[1:00:36] time where we know
[1:00:40] that there a
[1:00:42] day in the last
[1:00:45] day all those who are
[1:00:47] asleep all those who are in the sixth
[1:00:50] Dimension
[1:00:52] amen they will come together with
[1:00:56] him and we all of us will
[1:00:59] change and then we can meet
[1:01:02] him but for that to
[1:01:05] happen it it needs you not to
[1:01:09] remain so that you don't
[1:01:11] Remain the the question
[1:01:14] says do you believe
[1:01:17] that
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:20] amen believest thou that hallelujah amen
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:26] he that believeth in
[1:01:30] me though he were
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:37] dead there's no one who doesn't love to
[1:01:42] live we have people
[1:01:45] today they are in
[1:01:47] hospitals what they are fighting for
[1:01:50] they are fighting to
[1:01:52] live amen
[1:01:56] but the god that we
[1:01:58] worship he takes where the doctors has
[1:02:01] said they are
[1:02:03] failed where the doctors are now
[1:02:07] surrendering saying there's nothing we
[1:02:09] can do
[1:02:10] in actually I have a
[1:02:14] testimony of our sisters who we worship
[1:02:18] with that the
[1:02:21] husband where the doctor said we can't
[1:02:23] do anything
[1:02:26] just go
[1:02:30] prepare but the sister
[1:02:34] said where the doctor's knowledge ended
[1:02:37] there is a
[1:02:40] God he's taking right from there
[1:02:43] hallelujah
[1:02:45] amen
[1:02:46] impossible and brings the
[1:02:50] impossible and make it to
[1:02:53] be
[1:02:55] and take from where there was
[1:02:57] death and bring life
[1:03:00] R now I want to say today
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:04] only all things are
[1:03:08] possible if you
[1:03:12] believe the pastor has spoken enough
[1:03:16] yday
[1:03:19] amen he spoke about the mother and about
[1:03:23] us but now today I want to focus on us
[1:03:27] because the mother has walked her
[1:03:29] journey now me and you we are here and
[1:03:33] now that we have remained the question
[1:03:38] says where are we going to spend our
[1:03:42] eternity the time that we
[1:03:45] in we are in a time
[1:03:47] where we are at the end of
[1:03:50] everything hallelujah amen we are at the
[1:03:54] end of
[1:03:56] everything this world we are
[1:03:59] in it has arrived where it is
[1:04:02] ending and the Bible is
[1:04:05] saying if you want to know
[1:04:09] that he says look at all the signs
[1:04:12] hallelujah
[1:04:14] amen the signs are
[1:04:17] saying that the time we are
[1:04:21] in is the time where everything is
[1:04:26] ending but for that to
[1:04:30] happen let it happen while your
[1:04:34] life it is also in
[1:04:39] Christ the word of God is
[1:04:43] saying before the end of the
[1:04:50] world there will be the drying of the
[1:04:52] river
[1:04:53] Euphrates
[1:04:55] we have seen that has happened
[1:04:58] today you can even check Google and
[1:05:03] see the Bible is saying there will be
[1:05:06] the shaking of the world the
[1:05:14] earthquakes we see there are
[1:05:17] flats we see there are
[1:05:21] fires all these things they are
[1:05:25] saying there's somewhere where we are
[1:05:28] going they are happening right before
[1:05:31] our
[1:05:33] eyes but I'm going to
[1:05:39] say and don't just
[1:05:45] believe don't believe that I'm in the
[1:05:49] church don't believe that I have the
[1:05:53] pastor
[1:05:54] but believe unto Jesus
[1:05:57] himself because if you have met him
[1:06:01] amen everything will be
[1:06:04] right
[1:06:05] amen the God has given us
[1:06:08] pastors and the pastors are preaching
[1:06:13] amen but the pastors who are
[1:06:15] preaching the word of God is
[1:06:18] saying those are the ones who are coming
[1:06:21] from him and God has given
[1:06:26] but you what you must do you must meet
[1:06:30] him meet Christ you must meet
[1:06:34] God and when you have met him
[1:06:38] amen he is the one who's going to your
[1:06:41] life amen hallelujah
[1:06:47] amen and believeth in
[1:06:50] me shall never
[1:06:53] die hallelujah
[1:06:56] amen he that
[1:06:58] believe believing unto
[1:07:00] God die he will never die hallelujah
[1:07:05] amen what does that mean he will never
[1:07:08] die
[1:07:11] words the more we are alive here on
[1:07:14] Earth having God in our
[1:07:17] midst then that means we have passed
[1:07:21] death and we have entered into life
[1:07:27] even if there can be
[1:07:29] death but the word of God says as
[1:07:32] long if as long as you are in
[1:07:36] him that death doesn't have power over
[1:07:39] your
[1:07:42] life because you have
[1:07:44] life that is eternal
[1:07:47] life that came
[1:07:49] how by you believing amen
[1:07:54] believing into Christ Jesus
[1:07:59] amen there are words here in Romans
[1:08:01] chter 14 verse 8 verse
[1:08:08] 8 Romans chapter
[1:08:12] 14:8 for whether we live we live unto
[1:08:16] the Lord and whether we die we die unto
[1:08:19] the Lord whether we live therefore or
[1:08:21] die we are the Lords

[1:08:29] live we live
[1:08:32] am we live for
[1:08:35] him we must live for
[1:08:40] him because when we
[1:08:43] live his word is in
[1:08:46] us when we say believe you believe the
[1:08:52] word because the word
[1:08:55] it it is
[1:08:58] him sometimes I
[1:09:00] I let God be gracious to
[1:09:03] us he he has been gracious to
[1:09:07] us when we were still growing
[1:09:11] up not
[1:09:13] believing while we are still attending
[1:09:16] school let me talk about me for a
[1:09:20] while I was still young at school and
[1:09:26] and there was this lady I
[1:09:29] left but I wasn't saved I was still a
[1:09:33] boy then I wrote a
[1:09:36] letter when I wrote the letter I'm
[1:09:39] saying the
[1:09:41] letter I'll give you
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:46] money I build a house for
[1:09:49] you
[1:09:51] amen I was at school that time in fact
[1:09:54] it was a higher Primary School it was a
[1:09:56] higher Primary School amen
[1:09:58] amen now
[1:10:01] that that
[1:10:03] letter I forgot it in the
[1:10:07] pocket when I forgot
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] it and then my mother was made doing
[1:10:15] washing when she's doing washing she's
[1:10:18] searching the
[1:10:20] pockets the mothers are searching the
[1:10:22] pockets before they do the Wasing
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] amen those who are trust withy when they
[1:10:29] find money they bring
[1:10:31] it
[1:10:36] amen when my mother found the
[1:10:40] letter she reads the
[1:10:44] letter she said
[1:10:49] yeah that's why money is just going here
[1:10:52] in the house
[1:10:54] we have a man
[1:10:56] here who's supporting a wife
[1:10:59] somewhere
[1:11:00] amen and I was doing
[1:11:05] this not understanding what I was doing
[1:11:10] amen when I arrived from school my
[1:11:14] mother said do you know this
[1:11:17] letter when I saw the letter
[1:11:20] was amen amen
[1:11:25] then that I was
[1:11:28] caught
[1:11:33] amen okay my mother has already
[1:11:36] passed she passed when she was
[1:11:40] 99 when she found the letter she said to
[1:11:45] me your father
[1:11:48] tonight he will be with
[1:11:51] you then I realized I'm in trouble
[1:11:55] but what I'm trying to say is
[1:12:00] this that God has given us a
[1:12:04] letter I
[1:12:06] regard as our love letter from the Lord
[1:12:10] I'm regarding this book as the love
[1:12:12] letter from the
[1:12:13] Lord
[1:12:17] amen because God has brought this
[1:12:20] word because he has love to us
[1:12:25] he doesn't even wish for one to be
[1:12:28] lost he doesn't even wish for
[1:12:32] one because where we are
[1:12:35] going we will talk the other
[1:12:37] day but what is
[1:12:41] important it it is to make right your
[1:12:44] life with
[1:12:45] God while time still
[1:12:50] permit then that will put you in a
[1:12:52] position
[1:12:55] that your life it is now led by
[1:12:58] him now he is able to speak to
[1:13:06] you because in the time that we in
[1:13:11] amen we are living in a time where
[1:13:14] God when you receive him to be in
[1:13:17] you he comes in
[1:13:20] you now there are certain spirits
[1:13:24] which are
[1:13:26] controlling because now maybe you
[1:13:28] haven't understood you haven't
[1:13:32] agreed doesn't allow any vacuum they nor
[1:13:42] say in other
[1:13:47] words in other words there is no space
[1:13:50] or any place where there is
[1:13:52] no
[1:13:54] or nature doesn't allow any vacuum amen
[1:14:00] amen trying to say
[1:14:02] that in the life of a
[1:14:06] person if Christ is not
[1:14:10] there amen if Christ is not there there
[1:14:14] is something
[1:14:15] that and that which is
[1:14:18] there it is fighting with
[1:14:22] Christ amen
[1:14:25] now and that which is taking the
[1:14:29] place it is making that even though you
[1:14:33] wish that you should have a
[1:14:35] life that is
[1:14:38] straightforward but that which is
[1:14:41] present it is fighting against your wish
[1:14:48] amen that is at some point you'll find
[1:14:51] people even try to take their lives
[1:14:54] has shut down because they
[1:15:00] realiz
[1:15:02] if if he has
[1:15:05] entered through you accepting then that
[1:15:09] means the higher
[1:15:14] power is taking
[1:15:17] place and the Lesser
[1:15:19] power has to vacate the place
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] amen because if he has taken place he is
[1:15:29] the almighty
[1:15:31] God he
[1:15:37] is he has made us also to be
[1:15:40] Al because we come from and we are
[1:15:44] returning to
[1:15:47] himen now it is
[1:15:51] important that when he is
[1:16:02] if there's something that is happening
[1:16:03] he will you
[1:16:07] lead sometimes you hear people
[1:16:11] saying there's something that is telling
[1:16:13] me to do
[1:16:15] this but you you find that is a wrong
[1:16:17] thing but this time but this
[1:16:20] time now when it is him
[1:16:25] all those things that were
[1:16:28] resting resting because of the
[1:16:32] condition because of the wrong
[1:16:35] Spirit when he arrives
[1:16:39] amre then the resurrection takes
[1:16:44] place because now he is in
[1:16:47] you he is now resurrecting things
[1:16:52] amen things which were not going the
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:58] way there is the word of God that is
[1:17:00] saying but seek therefore it says seek
[1:17:04] therefore seek
[1:17:06] first the kingdom of
[1:17:09] God and
[1:17:15] righte in other words the first thing
[1:17:18] that you must seek for you must seek God
[1:17:21] first am
[1:17:23] when God comes with
[1:17:25] hise he
[1:17:30] comes he comes with his
[1:17:32] nature
[1:17:35] amen this body that we are
[1:17:41] in this
[1:17:43] body it is taking the nature
[1:17:49] of but there is another
[1:17:52] body which is in this
[1:17:57] body that
[1:18:01] body in other words this body that we
[1:18:03] have put
[1:18:05] on it it needs its
[1:18:08] things it has its own
[1:18:13] nature it wants to do things of
[1:18:17] the
[1:18:21] amen why it is against that other body
[1:18:26] because that body
[1:18:27] inside it has the nature of God it wants
[1:18:31] to do the things of God but then there's
[1:18:34] a
[1:18:35] conflict when there is that
[1:18:39] conflict our God is always a
[1:18:43] victim overcome hallelujah amen
[1:18:46] then you are of righteousness then you
[1:18:50] are called to be of righteousness
[1:18:52] because you have seek God and you found
[1:18:57] him now seek the kingdom of
[1:19:07] God shall be
[1:19:11] add we need things because as we are
[1:19:14] here we need
[1:19:16] things but then we don't have
[1:19:19] them because even when we ask we ask
[1:19:22] wrong
[1:19:24] but now when we come to
[1:19:29] himed his
[1:19:31] nature having received his
[1:19:34] word allowing
[1:19:37] him to lead
[1:19:39] us to build our
[1:19:43] houses there's nothing nice in the

[1:40:33] announcement so we can get a direction
[1:40:35] how we going to go
[1:40:38] from and then after
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:49] that and we'll ask those who are coming
[1:40:52] to help us here while the rest of us are
[1:40:55] going
[1:40:58] [Music]

[1:41:17] something to
[1:41:18] drink and
[1:41:21] the pastors will be the ones who are
[1:41:24] following
[1:41:26] the family car and the rest of us will
[1:41:29] be coming after the pastor's come and
[1:41:32] then there is a transport to the grave
[1:41:35] site for those who need transport there
[1:41:38] are three uh EV buses outside so even
[1:41:44] those who might need to leave their Cas
[1:41:46] here use the transport it will also
[1:41:49] eliminate traffic going there
[1:41:51] so there is a transport outside those
[1:41:53] who need transport they can make use of

[1:42:57] leave our cars behind so those who don't
[1:43:00] have transport there is eos outside they
[1:43:03] will go in those buses but then if there
[1:43:07] is space remaining anyone who wish to
[1:43:09] leave the car can go in but let us give
[1:43:12] priority to those who don't have cars to
[1:43:14] go there amen shall we
