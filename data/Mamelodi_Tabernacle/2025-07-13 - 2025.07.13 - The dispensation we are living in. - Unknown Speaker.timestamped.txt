[2:00] the devil. Gracious heavenly father, he
[2:03] is the one who is sitting lord who is
[2:05] bringing all the hunger who is bringing
[2:08] all the situation that are here today.

[3:32] are your bride. Thank you heavenly
[3:34] father for the brother who is leading us
[3:36] with the songs. Thank you, Father. As we

[3:41] spirit that there's something where we
[3:43] are going, Lord, where we'll be washing
[3:46] with that season in the name of the Lord
[3:49] Jesus Christ. Those who were sick,
[3:51] Father, they'll be healed.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Those who came, Father, with their
[3:54] needs,
[3:55] &gt;&gt; God will meet their needs today.

[43:35] while my brother is the scripture for
[43:38] the children.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Where is the brother?
[43:47] Mark 10 from verse 13- 16.
[43:51] And they brought young children to him
[43:53] that he should touch them. And his
[43:56] disciples rebuked those that brought
[43:58] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[44:00] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[44:03] the little children to come unto me, and
[44:06] forbid them not. For of such is the
[44:08] kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you,
[44:12] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[44:14] of God as a little child, he shall not
[44:17] enter therein." And he took them up in
[44:20] his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[44:23] blessed them.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; They brought their young children unto
[44:27] him
[44:29] so that he may touch them.
[44:35] They believed that if he can touch them,
[44:41] something will happen to their children.
[44:45] I believe also these ones
[44:49] They believe the same thing
[44:52] that they have brought their children to
[44:54] him
[44:57] because he is the same yesterday, today,
[44:59] and forever.
[45:03] He only changed the mask,
[45:08] but he's the same Christ.
[45:12] Hallelujah.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; What is the name of this one?
[45:18] Malvin.

[53:56] &gt;&gt; Um while standing on our feet,
[54:00] Let's open the book of Daniel chapter 9.
[54:06] Daniel chapter 9 verse 25- 27 verse 257.
[54:15] Daniel chapter 9 from verse 25- 27.
[54:20] Know therefore and understand that from
[54:23] the going forth of the commandment to
[54:26] restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
[54:30] Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks
[54:34] and three score and two weeks. The
[54:37] street shall be built again, and the
[54:40] wall even in trouble's time.
[54:45] And after three score and two weeks
[54:47] shall Messiah be cut off, but not for
[54:50] himself.
[54:52] And the people of the prince that shall
[54:55] come shall destroy the city and the
[54:57] sanctuary. And the end thereof shall be
[55:01] with a flood. And unto the end of the
[55:04] war, desolation
[55:06] and deter and det are determined.
[55:11] And he shall confirm the covenant with
[55:14] many for one week. And in the midst of
[55:17] the week, he shall cause the sacrifice
[55:22] and the oblation to cease. And for the
[55:26] overspreading of abomination, he shall
[55:30] make it desolate even until the
[55:33] consummation and that determined shall
[55:36] be poured upon the desolate.
[55:40] Thank you my brother. Let me just uh
[55:44] read another one brother but now read
[55:46] Romans
[55:51] uh chapter uh 11.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Romans 11.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Let's read verse 20
[55:59] uh 5- 26.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; 25- 26.
[56:07] For I would note, brethren, that you
[56:10] should be ignorant of this mystery,
[56:14] lest you should be wise in your own
[56:16] conceits, that blindness in part is
[56:20] happened to Israel, until the fullness
[56:23] of the Gentile become in. And so all
[56:26] Israel shall be saved, as it is written,
[56:30] there shall come out of Zion the
[56:33] deliverer,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and shall turn away ungodliness from
[56:36] Jacob.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; You may
[56:40] take your seats.
[56:45] Let's close our eyes as we pray.
[56:50] Mighty heavenly father,
[56:54] scriptures are read.
[56:57] We are approaching
[57:01] thy holy presence.
[57:05] I'm here with my brother.
[57:09] We dedicate our voices unto thee
[57:15] &gt;&gt; so that you can use our voice. Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; To deliver your message unto your
[57:23] children.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, in the name of the Lord
[57:27] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I
[57:35] greet you again
[57:38] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[57:40] Savior Jesus Christ.
[57:46] Um I'm not so much all right
[57:51] but we are going to go on.
[57:55] I I I I I should not I should have not
[57:57] come here.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; But because my sister daunted me,
[58:07] I thought they time
[58:10] I don't want to break his heart.
[58:14] I want to break Satan's heart
[58:20] because he didn't want me to come.
[58:24] My voice was taken
[58:28] taken,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; but now he's back. Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Um,
[58:36] let's talk about the the dispensation we
[58:40] are living in now.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Just for a while.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; We're just going to talk.
[58:57] We have read the book of Daniel.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; It says
[59:07] Daniel prophesied
[59:10] about the whole dispensation.
[59:18] The whole Jewish dispensation.
[59:24] until the consummation
[59:29] and brother says
[59:33] if you want to know what day you are
[59:35] living in
[59:37] what what day what day
[59:46] let me put it like this
[59:48] if you want to know what Day of the
[59:52] month
[59:54] is it?
[59:59] You look at the calendar
[1:00:01] calendar.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; But he says if you want to know the day
[1:00:05] you are living in
[1:00:11] scripturally
[1:00:14] look at Israel.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; He says Israel is our calendar.
[1:00:24] Um
[1:00:26] Daniel said
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; they were given seven treats were given
[1:00:34] to the to Daniel's people
[1:00:42] and his city.
[1:00:45] Daniel's people
[1:00:47] and Daniel's city
[1:00:52] they were given 7 weeks
[1:00:58] in other words until consummation.
[1:01:05] There is nothing after 70.
[1:01:10] that this consummation
[1:01:13] is finished with Daniel's people.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:01:22] he he he I he divided those weeks.
[1:01:29] He divided them into three periods.
[1:01:38] Three and a half
[1:01:40] Um
[1:01:43] the first period
[1:01:48] it was the period of the building of the
[1:01:51] temple.
[1:01:55] It was seven weeks
[1:02:00] and the second
[1:02:03] is 62 weeks.
[1:02:08] If you can add them,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; it is 69.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; 69
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; and 62 weeks.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; 62 weeks.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; It was
[1:02:21] from the completion of the temple
[1:02:28] until the Messiah.
[1:02:34] that is it will take 62 weeks
[1:02:41] and then one week
[1:02:44] it was given to Christ's ministry
[1:02:51] are you together
[1:02:53] I said it those seven weeks
[1:02:58] were divided into three periods
[1:03:05] The first one is 7 week period
[1:03:11] and the the second
[1:03:14] is 62 week period
[1:03:18] and the third one is one week period.
[1:03:24] Are you together now?
[1:03:26] And I said this one
[1:03:29] of seven week
[1:03:34] it was given to the building of the
[1:03:36] temple
[1:03:40] it will be built for seven weeks.
[1:03:45] And the second one
[1:03:48] when the temple is completed
[1:03:52] from there from the completion of the
[1:03:54] temple
[1:03:57] Until the Messiah arrive
[1:04:01] in Jerusalem, there
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; it will be 62 weeks.
[1:04:13] Then when he has arrived,
[1:04:18] he will be given one week
[1:04:21] to minister.
[1:04:25] Are you together now?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; These are given to Daniel's people.
[1:04:35] These seven weeks,
[1:04:38] Daniel's people
[1:04:41] and his city,
[1:04:43] Daniel's people,
[1:04:45] they are Jews,
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; not Gentiles,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Jews.
[1:04:52] These are given only to the
[1:04:57] his city
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; is Jerusalem.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Gentiles are not there.
[1:05:12] Then now this one week
[1:05:16] which is given to Christ ministry
[1:05:22] It was divided into two.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; One week
[1:05:34] is equals to seven years.
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:45] Are you listening?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; All right. If you are listening then I
[1:05:49] can go.
[1:05:51] Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; If you take seven weeks
[1:05:58] and multiply them by seven
[1:06:03] because one week
[1:06:05] is seven years.
[1:06:08] When you multiply seven by seven,
[1:06:13] it will give you 49.
[1:06:16] Yes.
[1:06:19] In other words, they have taken 49 years
[1:06:26] building the temple.
[1:06:38] You multiply it by seven
[1:06:42] give you number of years.
[1:06:46] When we go to one week,
[1:06:50] we know that is seven years.
[1:06:57] Then when you divide seven by two,
[1:07:04] I don't have a pointer here.
[1:07:08] Can you give me a pointer
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; to point there?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a point, doesn't
[1:07:16] matter.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Um, if you divide seven by two,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; it will give you three and a half.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:07:37] prophesied
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; three and a half years
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; from 8030.
[1:07:51] He preached
[1:07:53] for three years.
[1:07:57] Then after 3 years
[1:08:03] he was cut off.
[1:08:10] He prophesied three and a half years.
[1:08:14] After three and a half years,
[1:08:17] he was cut off.
[1:08:23] When he was cut off,
[1:08:29] Gentiles
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; came in there.
[1:08:36] I call it a gap
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; between that the last three and a half
[1:08:42] years and
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; the first three and a half years and
[1:08:47] years
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; because this and that one
[1:08:52] seven years.
[1:08:57] Are you with me there?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Then when he was cut off
[1:09:04] There were prophecies here
[1:09:08] because he prophesied about the
[1:09:11] destruction of the city,
[1:09:16] destruction of the temple.
[1:09:20] And then he prophesied about the the bad
[1:09:23] of the fig tree
[1:09:30] and other trees.
[1:09:33] talking about their restoration
[1:09:38] because he prophesied about them being
[1:09:40] scattered.
[1:09:44] But he prophesied about them coming back
[1:09:47] again
[1:09:50] when he was here.
[1:09:53] when he prophesied
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and as he has said
[1:10:01] the city was destroyed
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; because he said it will be destroyed
[1:10:14] the temple was destroyed
[1:10:19] they were they were scattered to
[1:10:21] different nation
[1:10:25] And they
[1:10:27] when they were there,
[1:10:29] we read the the book of Romans.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Can you read it again, my brother?
[1:10:40] Romans 11 from verse 25.
[1:10:45] For I would not, brethren, that you
[1:10:47] should be ignorant of this mystery, lest
[1:10:51] you should be wise in your own conceits,
[1:10:54] that blindness in part is happened to
[1:10:57] Israel, until the fullness of the
[1:11:00] Gentile become in
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; just there.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; This people of Israel,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Daniel's people,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; they were blinded.
[1:11:15] So they rejected their messiah.
[1:11:19] That's why he was cut off
[1:11:24] because they were blinded.
[1:11:27] When they were blinded,
[1:11:29] the Bible says here they were blinded
[1:11:34] until
[1:11:36] the fullness of the Gentile.
[1:11:41] Hey, the Bible is telling us here
[1:11:45] when they were blinded,
[1:11:48] God will call the Gentiles
[1:11:51] for his name.
[1:11:56] When you call somebody for your name,
[1:12:00] you marry her.
[1:12:03] Amen. Because you give her your name.
[1:12:09] Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, in this gap,
[1:12:14] God will call his wife
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:19] because he must have his wife with his
[1:12:22] name.
[1:12:30] They were called.
[1:12:32] They were called here
[1:12:34] the Gentiles.
[1:12:36] They were called
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; here
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; through seven messengers
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:47] until to the seven church age.
[1:12:53] There are seven church ages somewhere
[1:12:55] here
[1:13:00] above
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; because seven church ages church age
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; is time
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; then above
[1:13:11] here
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; is above time.
[1:13:19] John says
[1:13:21] Revelation chapter
[1:13:23] 4,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; he said, "After this,
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I saw the door open,
[1:13:36] after this,
[1:13:38] after." Wow. Ah, no. After this, I saw
[1:13:41] the the door open in heaven.
[1:13:48] I heard the voice
[1:13:52] just like the first voice.
[1:13:56] I heard it now.
[1:13:59] I heard it now in heaven.
[1:14:03] After this,
[1:14:05] I can I can hear now from heaven.
[1:14:09] Another ministry now
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:15] is no more the ministry of seven church
[1:14:18] agents.
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:22] Is another ministry
[1:14:25] beyond
[1:14:27] beyond time.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; He was called to heaven.
[1:14:38] Hallelujah.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; When he is there,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; he could see things in heaven.
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:50] After time,
[1:14:52] the seven angel messenger
[1:14:55] the seventh
[1:14:59] was called up here.
[1:15:05] He said, "I went to the west.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I met seven angels
[1:15:16] in a form of a pyramid
[1:15:21] because the throne
[1:15:23] is seen from inside.
[1:15:27] You cannot see it from outside.
[1:15:31] That's why he was taken inside the
[1:15:33] pyramid
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; because now he had another ministry.
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Then he brought this thing
[1:15:50] here,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; the capstone.
[1:15:55] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; He brought it down. situation
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; kept the church
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; because the ministry after
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; seven
[1:16:11] is the ministry of capstone
[1:16:16] ministry of cap is not the ministry of
[1:16:19] time
[1:16:22] the ministry of the capstone
[1:16:26] is is not the ministry of time
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; is the mystery after time.
[1:16:35] Amen.
[1:16:36] And you cannot understand it
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; because it's the ministry of the throne.
[1:16:45] You must get inside.
[1:16:48] You cannot understand it if you are not
[1:16:50] inside.
[1:16:54] All the outsiders
[1:16:57] They don't understand it.
[1:17:00] They cannot understand that capstone.
[1:17:07] They've written their love.
[1:17:11] If you look at the the pyramid there.
[1:17:15] Why? Why have they written love there?
[1:17:19] Because he's love is God.
[1:17:24] The capstone
[1:17:26] is God.
[1:17:28] Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:17:37] we are living here
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; beyond
[1:17:43] time.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; now
[1:17:52] we are invited
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; to come
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; and eat
[1:18:01] because
[1:18:03] God told the seven angel messenger.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm just giving you a tip
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; said store the food.
[1:18:18] Why should he store the food?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He was stoing it for me.
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; So that
[1:18:33] I and
[1:18:39] me I must start by pastor first.
[1:18:45] We can go
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; and pick those
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; and present it unto you.
[1:19:02] Amen.
[1:19:03] If he didn't,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; what will you be eating at this point in
[1:19:15] time?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He studed them.
[1:19:22] He said don't worry I'm taking long time
[1:19:24] when I preach
[1:19:28] because I'm story
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:35] they are hidden manner
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:40] hidden manner is not just taken by
[1:19:42] anybody
[1:19:44] because they are hidden.
[1:19:55] Now
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; this dispensation
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; is the dispens where you have to partake
[1:20:09] to partake from the hidden manner.
[1:20:16] You must eat
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; of the body weight
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; This is the dispensation of eagles.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; The proverb says
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; for the eagle to fly high
[1:20:45] It must eat fresh food.
[1:20:53] The prophet knew
[1:20:56] that in this time
[1:20:59] where we are living now
[1:21:02] it will time for ichess.
[1:21:06] So that they must be prepared to fly.
[1:21:10] They must eat it fresh man.
[1:21:15] He said why the vulture cannot fly like
[1:21:18] an eagle.
[1:21:22] He said the answer is the food it is
[1:21:25] eating.
[1:21:32] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:21:37] Amen.
[1:21:39] It cannot fly higher.
[1:21:44] The problem is the foot.
[1:21:48] That's why the prophet says
[1:21:51] it helps.
[1:21:55] You must know where you attend the
[1:22:00] church at
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and you must know who is fitting you.
[1:22:12] Because this is the time of
[1:22:15] the eagles must be fed
[1:22:19] by by the hidden manner
[1:22:22] so that they can fly.
[1:22:25] This is the time to fly
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:33] and you will fail
[1:22:37] if you don't identify
[1:22:41] where those foods are.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; We are That's why
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; he says
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; this is a mystery
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; that Israel
[1:23:08] was blinded
[1:23:16] is the Bible says
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; that is Paul.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. He will come like a thief.
[1:23:26] in the night.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; But he said not to you,
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; but to those who are blind,
[1:23:39] those who are ling the food,
[1:23:43] he will come to them as a thief.
[1:23:48] But you know,
[1:23:55] They were blinded
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; so that he can come
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; call us
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; in the gap.
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; When we read through chapter 3,
[1:24:11] I believe it's verse 14. Verse 14,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; it's it talks about churches.
[1:24:19] He said the people there
[1:24:22] They are blind.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Why now blind?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Why now blind?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; They are the people.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; The last church age
[1:24:36] people there are blind.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Then he said he is knocking at the door
[1:24:46] outside
[1:24:48] the age.
[1:24:52] The ages driving him out
[1:24:57] because they are blind.
[1:25:03] Why blind?
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; So that he can go back to Israel
[1:25:10] to come to us.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded.
[1:25:15] To go back to Israel,
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Gentiles must be blinded.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Read
[1:25:29] Hosea.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Read chapter 6.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Hosea chapter 6.
[1:25:47] Hosea chapter 6.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hosea chapter 6.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; If you find it,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; read it.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to2.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to2.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Chapter 6 verse 1-2.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 6 verse 1-2.
[1:26:12] Come and let us return unto the Lord for
[1:26:15] he hath torn and he will heal us. He
[1:26:18] hath smitten and he will bind us up.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; After two days will he revive us. In the
[1:26:27] third day he will rise us up and we
[1:26:30] shall live in his sight.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] This is this this script here
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; he was giving a prophecy
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; of this time
[1:26:46] this time.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Are you listening
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; now? He was talking to Israel.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Israel saying
[1:26:59] he has torn us apart.
[1:27:03] He has scattered us.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Now he will sc will gather us again.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Prophesied in those days.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He say it was 780
[1:27:21] BC
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; when he prophesied.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; But that thing happened later after
[1:27:30] Jesus.
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:35] when they were scattered.
[1:27:38] But now
[1:27:40] they've been brought back.
[1:27:43] He said, "Let's return to him
[1:27:48] because he's the one who taught us
[1:27:52] now he will heal us."
[1:27:56] Is that after two days?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; After 2,000 years,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; he will wake us.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; That is what he says.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He will revive us.
[1:28:19] He said on the third day
[1:28:23] he will raise us up
[1:28:25] they will have a revival when they come
[1:28:27] together
[1:28:31] coming it was revival
[1:28:36] but on the third day
[1:28:39] he will raise them up.
[1:28:43] Where are we living now?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; On the third day
[1:28:51] we are above 2,000.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; We are on the third day.
[1:28:58] What what can happen
[1:29:01] for Israel
[1:29:03] to rise up?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; When they raise up is when they
[1:29:08] recognize him.
[1:29:12] Amen. That is the day
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; we are living in now.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He said in book the book of Romans
[1:29:24] he said when the time of the the
[1:29:26] fullness of the Gentiles has come
[1:29:32] then Israel will be saved again.
[1:29:36] That is what Paul is saying.
[1:29:39] That is what is saying.
[1:29:42] Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Talking about Israel,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; there are prophecies of it.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Put my picture back there.
[1:30:01] Here
[1:30:05] they were scattered.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Here they were gathered.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Israel. Israel.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; In this gap here
[1:30:17] in this gap here.
[1:30:20] Israel was scattered.
[1:30:22] In this gap here, Israel were gathered.
[1:30:31] Now in this gap here,
[1:30:34] Israel is gathered.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; In this gap here,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; what are they waiting for?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; They're waiting for their Messiah.
[1:30:47] in this gap here.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; But the the pro the prophecy said
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; they will receive the Messiah on the
[1:30:58] third day.
[1:31:03] And according to the
[1:31:06] Yes,
[1:31:08] we are living on the third day.
[1:31:12] And if they recognize their Messiah,
[1:31:16] They will recognize him when we are we
[1:31:18] are not here.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; They will recognize him. In other words,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; you are just standing on your toes.
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:35] You are not standing on your
[1:31:38] now. you are staying the one you are
[1:31:41] [Applause]
[1:31:42] because your time
[1:31:46] is over.
[1:31:50] Amen.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; While we are looking at the Israel,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; when we are looking at them
[1:31:58] there is
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:02] these two walls.
[1:32:05] Other one is this side of Millennium.
[1:32:12] Other one is that side of me.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; The other one is Ezekiel chapter 38 and
[1:32:20] 39.
[1:32:22] 38
[1:32:24] says
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; it will be fought
[1:32:28] when the bride is taken.
[1:32:33] Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Now what is happening in Israel?
[1:32:39] There are wars.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; When they talk about this G,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Pia is mentioned there
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; and Pia
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; is Iran.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And then Russia
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; because Gawk is Russia.
[1:33:05] because Gog is the prince
[1:33:09] of Gog of Mog.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Prophecies is Russia,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; but he said it will be with Persia
[1:33:24] and other countries
[1:33:27] fighting with Israel.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; But we know
[1:33:36] Russia and other country will be
[1:33:37] defeated by Israel.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Now because
[1:33:46] there is a war
[1:33:49] if that war is leading to
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:57] it means we are standing on our tombs.
[1:34:05] The prophecy must be fulfilled.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Russia must fight with Israel.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Is the prophecies
[1:34:23] read Ezekiel chapter 44.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] Verse one, two, three.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[1:34:45] Ezekiel 44 verse 1 to3.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 44 1-3.
[1:34:51] Then he brought me back the way of the
[1:34:55] gates of the outward sanctuary, which
[1:34:59] lookth toward the east, and it was shut.
[1:35:02] Then said the Lord unto me, "This gate
[1:35:05] shall be shut. It shall not be opened,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and no man shall enter in by it."
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord, the God of Israel,
[1:35:15] hath entered in by it,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; therefore it shall be shut.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is for let's just stop there.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; The secular says
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; he led me through the gate.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Then he said this gate
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; must be shut.
[1:35:40] This eastern gate,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; the walls of Jerusalem
[1:35:48] has seven gates,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; but there is one
[1:35:55] which faces east
[1:35:59] which is called the eastern gate.
[1:36:04] Hallelujah. Ezekiel says, "This gate
[1:36:09] must be shut."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; He was prophesying that time
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; about the gate.
[1:36:23] Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; It must be shut
[1:36:26] because the king has entered in.
[1:36:31] When Jesus entered Jerusalem,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; he entered through this gate
[1:36:39] in Matthew chapter 21.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; When Jesus entered there, he entered
[1:36:45] through the eastern gate,
[1:36:48] Ezekiel said, "It must be shut because
[1:36:52] the enter
[1:37:01] There was a king
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; after
[1:37:05] who closed that gate.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Only that gate
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; other other six they still
[1:37:16] they're still open even
[1:37:18] but that one it was closed
[1:37:23] it is even now closed.
[1:37:27] Because Ezekiel said
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; it must be closed.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; You see the prophecy spoke
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; then someone comes
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; and fulfills that prophecy.
[1:37:49] That is the name of the man
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; in 1541.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; 1541
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; close that gate.
[1:37:56] And he used big stones.
[1:38:01] Why? He said because they say
[1:38:07] the the juices,
[1:38:10] the Messiah
[1:38:12] is going to come through it.
[1:38:15] Now I must close it so that the Messiah
[1:38:18] must not come. I shall see where the
[1:38:20] Messiah will get through.
[1:38:26] Because this one I'm shutting it
[1:38:31] big stones.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; But
[1:38:43] prophesied.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; He had prophesied.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; I was with my pastor.
[1:38:52] That's why I had to read this thing.
[1:38:55] He told me at that gate
[1:38:59] now is about to be open.
[1:39:04] [Applause]
[1:39:06] When my pastor told me
[1:39:08] then I have to go and look.
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:14] I found that yes.
[1:39:17] They say there is things happen near
[1:39:18] that gate.
[1:39:23] sometimes they see
[1:39:25] dust
[1:39:28] coming out of that.
[1:39:32] There are some cracks
[1:39:37] in the gate there on those rocks
[1:39:43] where
[1:39:46] no one will open it.
[1:39:48] Even their messiah will learn to
[1:39:51] authenticate.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But now
[1:39:58] some forces
[1:40:02] are opening it. Now
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Zechariah
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Zechariah
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; verse 14. Chapter 14 I believe.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Zechariah 14.
[1:40:18] I will want you to read verse four
[1:40:26] verse4.
[1:40:28] And his feet shall stand in the day upon
[1:40:31] the mount of olives,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; which is before Jerusalem on the east.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and the mount of olive shall cleave in
[1:40:41] the midst thereof toward the east and
[1:40:43] toward the west.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. According to the Bible
[1:40:50] in Zagaria there,
[1:40:54] the Jews
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; are waiting for Christ,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; the Messiah
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; to come
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; to this mountain.
[1:41:05] Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; This mountain
[1:41:08] is just facing
[1:41:10] Jer
[1:41:12] gate.
[1:41:17] That's why they believed that he will
[1:41:19] come on that mountain
[1:41:23] to get through that gate
[1:41:26] because that mountain
[1:41:28] is all right. Let's read another
[1:41:31] scripture.
[1:41:33] Read my brother.
[1:41:36] Acts chapter one
[1:41:39] verse 12. Verse 12. My pastor told me
[1:41:44] the gate
[1:41:46] is shaking
[1:41:50] when after telling me
[1:41:53] I go and look.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I see it. Oh, it's shaking.
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; The Messiah
[1:42:07] is coming.
[1:42:14] Chapter one.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Chapter one
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; verse. Because they say,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; "All right, read it." The Bible talk.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Then returned they unto Jerusalem from
[1:42:26] the mount called olive
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day
[1:42:31] journey.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; through 12.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why
[1:42:52] stand ye gazing up into heaven?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; This same Jesus which is taken up from
[1:42:57] you into heaven
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; shall so come in like manner as he have
[1:43:02] seen him go into heaven.
[1:43:04] 12
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Then returned they unto Jerusalem from
[1:43:08] the mount called Olive, which is from
[1:43:11] Jerusalem a Sabbath day journey.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; When Jesus, according to the scripture,
[1:43:18] according to what they believe,
[1:43:20] they believe that Jesus will return
[1:43:22] again
[1:43:25] on this month only.
[1:43:27] The same place
[1:43:30] he ascended into heaven from.
[1:43:36] When he ascended to seven to heaven,
[1:43:39] he was on Mount Olive.
[1:43:43] The Bible says so. My brothers read it.
[1:43:46] You read, you must read your Bible.
[1:43:50] When he was ascending to heaven,
[1:43:53] he they were on Mount Olive.
[1:43:58] Mount Olive is just next to the eastern
[1:44:01] gate. After
[1:44:04] he has ascended up,
[1:44:07] they went through the gate
[1:44:10] back into the Jerusalem again. The Bible
[1:44:14] says so.
[1:44:17] Amen. They believe
[1:44:20] he will come back
[1:44:22] on that mountain where he ascended to he
[1:44:26] from.
[1:44:29] He will come back on that mountain.
[1:44:34] When he ascend
[1:44:36] the gentiles were not there.
[1:44:40] Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; When he ascended to heaven gents were
[1:44:43] not there.
[1:44:47] He was with his 12 apostles.
[1:44:52] The Jews
[1:44:54] they waiting for him to come back there
[1:44:58] to the Jews.
[1:45:00] Not to you
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; to us
[1:45:05] in a supernatural realm.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; He has resend. He has descended.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the corporal.
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:22] Is it
[1:45:25] he will appear again?
[1:45:30] to us.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; In a glorified,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; we shall see him
[1:45:41] because we'll be like him.
[1:45:46] Three,
[1:45:49] amen.
[1:45:51] When he returns,
[1:45:56] he will be in a corporal body.
[1:46:02] Thessalonians chapter 1 first chapter 4.
[1:46:08] He say he will move from the seventh
[1:46:10] dimension
[1:46:13] and go to the sixth
[1:46:15] and pick the saints there
[1:46:19] who are in the theophony
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:23] and come back with them.
[1:46:27] He will remain between heaven and earth.
[1:46:32] Those brothers and sisters
[1:46:36] who are in their theophanes,
[1:46:39] they will come to us
[1:46:42] so that we together with them
[1:46:47] can change
[1:46:49] our bodies. This is a vile body
[1:46:53] [Music]
[1:46:54] is a pest house.
[1:46:58] Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; We will take this pest house.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; He will come back with the theophony.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; He being in a glorified
[1:47:19] in the glorified.
[1:47:21] But the but brothers and sisters
[1:47:25] who have passed away they will come in
[1:47:28] theophanes
[1:47:31] when they come here on earth
[1:47:34] they will find us

[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:43] theophony in us will be

[1:47:53] because
[1:47:57] he has brought them.
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Then this this this terrible body
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; will vanish.
[1:48:16] We shall put on another body.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; When Elohim went to Abraham
[1:48:26] with two angels,
[1:48:29] he just took 16 elements on earth
[1:48:33] and build.
[1:48:36] He said, "You get into this one. This is
[1:48:39] your
[1:48:40] this one. Get into this one. This is
[1:48:43] what happening. He said now myself I get
[1:48:46] into this one.
[1:48:49] Now there are three men in inly bodies
[1:48:54] which are called glorified bodies
[1:48:57] because that in those bodies now we are
[1:49:00] can eat

[1:49:48] Give me that one.
[1:49:51] He eat because he was in a glorified
[1:49:55] body.
[1:49:58] After a while, he vanished
[1:50:02] with
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:06] after Abraham after Elohim has visited
[1:50:09] Abraham
[1:50:12] after after he has eaten
[1:50:17] Abraham. Now I'm moving
[1:50:20] after said I will I will accompany you.
[1:50:23] All right, let's come back.
[1:50:25] When they went to a certain place,
[1:50:29] he vanished.
[1:50:32] Abraham said, "Wait,
[1:50:36] he went back into
[1:50:41] the next morning,
[1:50:44] Abraham went where he was with Elohim.
[1:50:50] He

[1:50:53] at the same place

[1:50:59] where he was with Elohim, he could see
[1:51:02] so
[1:51:03] because he was standing at the right
[1:51:05] place.
[1:51:09] In order to see, you must come to the
[1:51:12] right place
[1:51:15] where the supernaturals are.
[1:51:22] You will not just see where we not just
[1:51:24] see at any place.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Where is my sketch?
[1:51:43] Where we are
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; this way. Where is my sketch here?

[1:52:18] things are happening
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; with us
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and with Israel.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:52:31] Gentiles
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; are blinded.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; They are singing.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; They are singing.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; They're performing miracles.
[1:52:44] But they are blinded.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; You see and Moses,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; and Moses,
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; they were performing miracles together.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Bam was performing more miracles.
[1:53:02] Moses,
[1:53:04] when it comes to prophecy, when it comes
[1:53:06] to miracles,
[1:53:09] you cannot identify which one is which
[1:53:11] one.
[1:53:14] by their difference.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; It was their teaching.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Our difference with this denomination
[1:53:27] is our teaching. They they will never
[1:53:30] reach where we are.
[1:53:34] Even if they can copy,
[1:53:38] these are hidden fruit.
[1:53:44] Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes as we pray.
[1:53:50] [Applause]
[1:53:58] Mighty heavenly father,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; you said no one knows
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; when you will come,
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; even the angels,
[1:54:15] only the father.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; This is the time
[1:54:23] of fatherhood.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; That is the reason
[1:54:29] we know
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; because the son doesn't know
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; during the dispensation of the son of
[1:54:38] God.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; People wouldn't know when you would
[1:54:43] come.
[1:54:45] But because we are beyond
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; the dispensation of the son of God,
[1:54:51] we are in the dispensation of the
[1:54:53] fatherhood.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Now we know.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; We know these things.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, father.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; You said it doesn't take
[1:55:10] men to run.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; It takes you.
[1:55:15] to identify
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and choose.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you for
[1:55:22] this time we are living in.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; This time
[1:55:28] is the dispensation of the rapture.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; We hear
[1:55:37] the sound of the harvesting machine.
[1:55:39] Amen.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; We hear the sound of it coming
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; to harvest this crop.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; So that the elevator can take it
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; to where it can be stored.
[1:55:59] Is you is because of your grace and
[1:56:02] mercy.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; It's not because of
[1:56:07] our wisdom.
[1:56:10] Help your children here. You know them
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; when they were coming here.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:56:20] what is in their heart
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; and you know what they wanted.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; That's why you brought the message to
[1:56:29] them
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; the way they wanted it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Bless them Lord.

[1:56:48] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[2:15:28] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:15:31] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:15:32] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[2:15:35] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[2:15:38] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[2:15:40] them, "Repent and be baptized, every one
[2:15:43] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[2:15:46] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:15:49] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:15:51] the promise is unto you and to your
[2:15:53] children, and to all that are a far off,

[2:23:57] What a wonderful day.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful day for me.
[2:24:08] My heart is rejoicing.
[2:24:11] Uh just before we call the pastor to
[2:24:15] close in prayer,
[2:24:17] there's a testimony that I want to give.
[2:24:21] Uh if the pastor allows me
[2:24:25] my brother, can you just help to
[2:24:28] translate the testimony?
[2:24:36] I'm sure pastor Israel is rejoicing and
[2:24:40] dancing today.
[2:24:47] You know, few years ago,
[2:24:52] the pastor took myself and brother
[2:24:55] Morero
[2:24:59] to a hospital
[2:25:02] to see a young child.
[2:25:06] It was a very traumatizing
[2:25:10] situation.
[2:25:14] When we arrived at the hospital
[2:25:17] myself, I was shaking.
[2:25:21] I was very scared.
[2:25:25] That was the day we went to see Sister
[2:25:27] Perfect.
[2:25:29] Perfect. I think she was
[2:25:34] about two to three months.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; So they
[2:25:43] when we arrived at the hospital
[2:25:48] the mother was giving a testimony also
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; that
[2:25:54] you know there's this machine that they
[2:25:56] connect to see if the child is still
[2:25:57] alive.
[2:26:01] I don't know what you call those
[2:26:02] machines.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; But they will connect those machines.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; It will show that the child is not
[2:26:11] alive.
[2:26:13] Then they will bring another machine and
[2:26:16] another machine
[2:26:18] and
[2:26:19] the child was connected to oxygen
[2:26:25] but it didn't show life.
[2:26:30] But when they disconnect the machine
[2:26:34] to tell the mother the bad news,
[2:26:38] then the child is active.
[2:26:42] See,
[2:26:45] so
[2:26:47] then the pastor was talking to the
[2:26:50] mother, encouraging the mother
[2:26:54] to say nothing is impossible with God
[2:27:00] and
[2:27:02] the pastor took the child
[2:27:06] in in in in his hand.
[2:27:10] It it was a very traumatizing situation
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; because at that time
[2:27:20] myself and brother Morero
[2:27:23] we were saying
[2:27:25] hey this child will even pass away in
[2:27:27] the hands of the pastor.
[2:27:31] You know it was very scary
[2:27:33] but the pastor was so relaxed
[2:27:37] and took the child
[2:27:41] in in his arms
[2:27:44] and and the the mother was saying
[2:27:47] this child don't even sleep
[2:27:50] for the last few days.
[2:27:53] He has just been up
[2:27:55] [Music]
[2:27:57] you know and and the doctor was saying
[2:27:59] the child must sleep
[2:28:02] and the child was not sleeping. Then the
[2:28:05] pastor hold the child
[2:28:08] and started talking to the child.
[2:28:12] And Sister Perfect was looking at the
[2:28:13] pastor like this.
[2:28:16] And the pastor says,
[2:28:19] "When I leave the hospital,
[2:28:22] you're going to sleep. And the child was
[2:28:24] going like this."
[2:28:27] [Applause]
[2:28:28] And and we were very surprised.
[2:28:31] How is it possible
[2:28:33] that a child less than 3 months
[2:28:38] can understand what the pastor is saying
[2:28:41] because now the pastor was no longer
[2:28:42] talking to the mother but talking
[2:28:45] directly to the child
[2:28:48] you know and that time even the legs
[2:28:52] were
[2:28:56] they were joined at that time you know
[2:28:59] there was no sign that the child will
[2:29:00] ever walk
[2:29:04] even the doctors were saying This child
[2:29:06] will never walk.
[2:29:09] But the pastor talking to the child
[2:29:12] says you are going to walk
[2:29:16] you know and the child was just noting
[2:29:18] like this.
[2:29:20] And today
[2:29:23] she's baptized.
[2:29:27] Amen.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; This is wonderful.
[2:29:31] You know, it makes me rejoice in my
[2:29:33] heart
[2:29:35] and I'm sure the pastor is very happy
[2:29:38] to see sister Perfect being baptized.
[2:29:42] May the Lord richly bless you and may
[2:29:45] the Lord bless the family
[2:29:48] and our precious sister.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Pastor, over to you.
[2:29:55] [Applause]
[2:30:02] Let us pray.
[2:30:05] Oh dearly father,
[2:30:08] when you start to
[2:30:12] bring birth
[2:30:14] on the earth,
[2:30:17] you allow the water to be the first
[2:30:20] thing
[2:30:22] to come out.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Then after water, it will be blood. Then
[2:30:27] after blood would be the child.
[2:30:33] Knowing that there will come time
[2:30:37] when people want to come to you
[2:30:40] because it will take birth
[2:30:44] for someone to come to you.
[2:30:48] Then when they come they must follow the
[2:30:50] process of a natural birth.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; They must pass through the water.
[2:30:57] Because it's the first thing in the
[2:31:00] natural birth.
[2:31:02] After death, it will be water.
[2:31:06] The word
[2:31:09] then the spirit.
[2:31:12] As we have done
[2:31:14] according to as you have said,
[2:31:18] we believe you will take over from here.
[2:31:23] We believe you are taking over.
[2:31:26] as you have taken over
[2:31:29] with a sister when he was at the
[2:31:32] hospital.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Bless her and bless everybody
[2:31:37] who came out of this water in the name
[2:31:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Just turn to your
[2:31:51] neighbor and say, "God bless you richly.
[2:31:58] Brother,
[2:32:03] can you come forth? My brother,
[2:32:11] your father used to bless us and dance.
[2:32:16] So,
[2:32:18] we want you just to bless us with a
[2:32:20] song. And after we call uh
[2:32:24] my friend here
[2:32:27] just to say
[2:32:33] amen. Then we'll hand over to the
[2:32:34] worship team. May the Lord richly bless
[2:32:37] you. Amen.
[2:32:41] Hallelujah.
[2:32:47] But after such a testimony,
[2:32:52] am I right here? Okay. After such a
[2:32:55] testimony.
