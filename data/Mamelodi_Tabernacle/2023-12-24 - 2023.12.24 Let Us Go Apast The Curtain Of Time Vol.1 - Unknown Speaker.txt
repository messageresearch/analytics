Description:
Title: Let Us Look Apast The Curtain of Time. 
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 24 December 2023, during the December conference  at Heartfelt Arena in Pretoria.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 8:1 
Revelation 12:10-12  
The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about Looking Apast the curtain of time. 
The Seventh Seal is spoken off from the beginning, it goes all the way back from Genesis. It was opened and not preached. Something in brother Branham met that Melchizedek. There is something within us without mother or without father, it was not created but processed. 
We were attributes in the mind of God. 
The Sixth Seal was opened by Moses and Elijah, as they had the power to do it. The secret of the Sixth Seal is the prophets ( two men). The Sixth Seal was opened and not preached. 
Bro Branham could talk about Moses and Elijah but couldn’t talk about himself.
The sons of God will be gods. God begets gods. God is worshipped by gods in his image. The gods cannot be worshipped. 
For the tribulation period to come it will only happen when the bride is not here. The Man of sin can’t be revealed when the bride is still here. He is waiting for the bride to leave so that he can start his three and half years . Those three and half years is going to be a terrible time.
God doesn’t look at you, he looks at Christ. You must be in Christ in order to be seen by God as the image of the living Word. As an attributes you by pass your Theophany to come to the end to be tested.

God and man were one there. The gap was created when Adam lost the book. It went back to the original owner. The kinsman redeemer is the family man. You are saved by the blood of the kinsman. It makes you one with God.

The day of redemption is the day when the book is opened. Those who are  in the book of life will go through the judgement and will be saved by their works. Those who are not in the book will be cast into the fire. Those in the lambs book of life will no...

was not created okay but was then all the way back from Genesis this seventh seal from where amen amen now if you go back there the prophet says we were attributes in the mind of God that's why even today there's something in us okay amen now as you remember last time this seventh seal here the Bible says it was something that was preached now it says when he opened amen amen amen so the opening uh let me read this part here where it says the six C has been open to us we know and when it was opened we realized it was Moses and elij amen but we should read it we should read Moses when the six was open not preached amen so the seventh SE never said when it was preached it says when it was amen but the six was Moses and Elijah amen do you know that part in the book amen okay amen we looked at it many a time even now for the tribulation period which is coming very very soon we look at M Transfiguration and we see Moses and Elijah and my Prophet tells me they were in their theop because the Lord Jesus Took John and John John Peter and James amen as we have said before he met them at the sea was it still the same people John James James and then he said follow me amen amen abusa Edgar remembers that they cast their Nets and they couldn't catch anything and he said to them cast deeper amen amen and the Nets were full until the Nets were turn AP go deeper Peter joh James and the next thing the Bible says he took them up to [Music] the from down deeper go deeper go higher the Bible says he took them to the highest mountain so whatever he as them to do was either deeper or higher

the bride whisk away before it begins it's a terrible thing that 3 and a half years [Applause] Satan what did you doeses scripture say Revelation 12 okay say it brother Revelation 12 from verse 10 to 12 well what it says and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice ye

there not yet because they differ okay give to the brother he will give it back to you now the the six was opened by Moses and Elijah amen you know it but I just want to read it out of the book there it is there in the book okay Moses and Elijah opened the six seal amen amen where is brother we had it right now brother wanted to print it okay but meanwhile okay amen Moses mosha and Elijah they opened who that is Page 428 they opened the six seal they have power to do it there is your Sixth Seal opened by Moses and Elijah do you believe that here is the six open here is the secret of it the prophets what is the secret of the sick the prophets amen amen amen now here is these two prophets P 428 God bless you brother uh there is the two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to Nature they want to they shake the Earth amen that is Moses and Elijah cuz this there is their Ministry amen amen the minister re impersonated again they open here it is the secret of the prophets the secret of the sick sin prophets Moses and elij did you hear the secret now there's a secret of the seventh but of the six two men Moses and El what is the secret of the sixes and El they open cu the Bible say they can open it any time they can do anything all right am let us pass on the six is that is the secret of it Moses and El they used to say finish and cl okay amen now this seventh SE when it was open silent in heaven what about the Earth it never said anything about the Earth it says in heaven it was all quiet meaning it was quiet in heaven not not here on Earth because there was a prophet down here on Earth amen amen amen and there's a part here [Music] and I see the people everywhere everywhere you went saying the six is not red now before we pick up on this thing let me read to you something here now it says the seventh now here in the Masterpiece page 10 I have read this many times and as God began to work upon the creeping things the little animals upon uh the Earth then he began to bring it from that into something else higher finally he brought it into the larger animals such as the lion beer then he brought it amen amen then he says that was complete creation God working on a pattern but finally finally came forth upon the earth a Perfection finally and that was a man [Music] that's why in The Book of adoption he [Music] says men what is men what will happen to men in the book Blasphemous names he says the sons of God will be [Applause] God and in that of adoption he says say it he says about you sons of God you are a God and there was an out cry brother says God I said when God begets [Applause] God and to put it right God is worship by [Applause] God that's why he said let us make men in our image let them and but in the book Blasphemous names Blasphemous nam I think page 10 11 he says the sons of God will be God you you are a God who is not worship you as a Son of God the prophet said you will be God but not a God that [Applause] can God is worshiped by the Gods in His image all right amen then then the but the gods who worship God cannot be worshiped brother bam brother shed some tears he when he realized that the people were saying he is [Applause] God the tears ran down I am not God okay amen now it says then God finally they came upon the as Perfection and that was a man then he could see in that man in that as brother bam says something in me met that something where amen Met m because meis without father and mother only be made by something that has no father no mother that was the soul when brother Bram says something in me that now God now Perfection that was a man because men in the image of God it's a perfect thing and then God could see in that man it looked like him [Applause] he was not looking at the frame he was looking at ins Insight that's why we have read this morning he says God don't look at you he looks at Christ so you should be in Christ in order to be God am am right amen so in Christ the image of the Living God all the attributes were in his mind before they became because he says as an attribute you came down he says we [Music] bypassed for to be tested here on God caused us to to bypass to come to the Earth to be tested you know you that's why you'll see here there some tested sounds we were in the then we realized that there were some side of the oven here stands the oven there's some PS on this side and on the other side then prices differ ports on this side are cheaper and on that other site are expensive then we were told that you see this port on this side they have failed the [Music] test but those on the other side they have passed through the [Music] fire because it says everybody who comes to him is tested [Applause] now then is all right the P of they were tested they are with cracks and S things like that they have failed the test that's why someon this site of the seventh one is on the other side things that are tested are not in the same place with the things that pass the test all right amen then he could see in that man it looked like him he opened all the sales but when he arrived at [Applause] the because that was something the brothers gave this in two books in two books where's the other one of transformation the power do I have it here okay now standing in the Gap standing in the Gap because you find the same thing in the book The Power of of transformation amen amen I asked the question whether the brothers gave it to me or not but don't worry they say it is right here okay amen amen now let's look at this standing in the Gap standing in the Gap is another book [Music] misunderstood I have we have tried and tried but the people don't understand standing in the Gap standing the gap which Gap it speaks of which Gap because there were was a g when Satan Adam F the book amen that's why a king's man to come because the first man Adam has lost the book that's why brother B says Redemption is the day the book is open that is the day of redemption that is the day the book is open now you have the book of life and the L's Book of Life the Bible says those in the Book of Life as the prophet taught me will go through the judgment because they will be saved amen amen like this that they are in the Book of Life only their Works will save them those who were not found in the Book of Life they were cast into the Lake of Fire but those in the Book of Life shall go through the Judgment they shall be saved according to their works that's said the prophet and then but those in the Lamb's Book of Life they don't go to the Judgment they have passed already they are in the Lamb's Book the bride of Christ is in the Lamb's Book the church is in the book of life but the briad is in the L Book of Life she she will never go to judg God cannot judge his wife amen he has judged her already and she was found to be his bride and it says the bride is Alpha and Omega did you read that she is if the husband is Alpha and Omega the wife also should be alega it't [Applause] match Alpha and Omega Alpha and Omega Merit Alpha and Omega Merit Al and Oma you know it he says the bride came for the second time but the church appeared only once but the bride came for for the second time she's alha and [Music] Omega right amen and you know he said Redemption the book of redemption the day of Redemption when is the day of redemption that is the day the book is open he says that is the day of redemption if you know let me look at this uh standing in the GP standing in the Gap a wonderful book also [Music] when Adam because the mystery of God as brother says it was God and Men we one day in your book Christ is the mystery is the mystery of of God revealed M amen now that's why we read that book it says the seventh when he arrived at the seven he stopped am why because it says at the sth he realized let me read it again will and standing in the Gap do you still remember what it [Music] is brother where's my book no okay let me quote it in creation then Masterpiece yes brother Master I can hear you or either power of transformation realize this before it close the power of transformation power of transformation now with the seven we will come either today tomorrow or next time where we come at the noted [Music] one after all here comes the noted one and the prophet was looking at the not then he speaks of the angel with the [Music] seven hey this message [Music] is this people are confused to the seventh SE the prophet saw an angel with the seventh SE because it's season for change you'll see if we go through we'll go into the Pyramid of the Angels do you still remember the angels from eternity and the prophet was put in the conation the Pyramid of angels [Music] tonight we can say Lord put us into the constellation okay amen it comes to that the ministry this ministry is not a you move from here to there it keeps on changing that's why the song says he keeps on changing me what is it for change season for [Music] change because if you don't change you will only recite the verses the quotes and season for [Applause] change that's why he couldn't say to them your disciples you were with me you have heard me speak you can quote vers now I'm leaving you no he said now it's season for change go to Jerusalem and receive the Holy [Music] Ghost then you will be my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come upon you it was not a prayer line Holy Ghost it was promised not a pre line one when people can jump and roll and yet they still don't know him but that one was the promised one amen I'm going to close we'll continue but let me look at this we were here standing because this Angel [Music] says I I was I was some or put in no okay when he was taken or lifted you know that angel as you know in the Bible God was put Westward men was put East Eastward now you hear brother say E and West men were was put e am then you hear the prophet saying I went West to connect is and West I went West to connect he says I went w was to connect with the Angel's message and I came back to preach to reveal it from from where from the I went because man was placed Eastward he say I went Westward to connect with the angels message and came back to reveal it [Applause] amen that's something yeah now it says the tacle now the people say it was revealed there at the no it was to the bride he came back amen amen the bride is God's Tabernacle that is the bride now standing in the Gap standing in the Gap we will leave it there and will continue standing in the Gap standing in the let us try it again men if you read Christ the of God Reve it tells you that men and God were one [Applause] day God would create something and sent it down sent it to let me cut it right amen he send it to to see because Adam was the other part of the Contra you know he say saw the prophet Adam the other part of the contract it comes to God take everything to the partner to see what would say if Adam says you are an elephant God says amen [Applause] amen amen amen now that's why it says the Gap because men and God were one when the men fated the book that's why the requirement was for a k man that's why I was Redeemed by the the the the blood of the family men [Music] are you refusing him we were Redeemed by the blood of the king man the Kings man is a family man now only the blood of the family man Redeem Me Now The Family Man is God himself came in a body like my body and I was saved by the blood of [Applause] K he's King to us whether you are black amen amen it matters not is the colors of God but is King to all of us whether you don't look down to somebody because the color of the skin is not the same amen right amen and uh now the Gap when Adam F the book it went back to the original owner and then and came the Lord Jesus Christ God himself that's why he says we are part of the blood of God he says when Gabriel came to [Music] Mary with a message amen he says when Mary believed and accepted the message that message became blood in the womb of Mary that's why the W of God if you accept that word it becomes blood in you and that's why you are saved by the blood of the king's man H it makes you one with God now when the Gap was open we'll we'll continue let's close with this they're not willing will when the Gap I I don't know my time when to call it I don't know what is my time what's the time for me to close okay they are not ready to answer us let's go on amen amen the king's man Redeemer he says this word that Gabriel brought to me because he says the the word that God spoke has never found a place until that word found a place in Mary the blood that somebody will refuse yet it will find a place in some good if God speaks that word cannot just drop to the Ground God will never speak a word if there is no place for that word before his speak there is a brother the place for that way there's a sister here place for that and when that word came comes it finds a dwelling place and it becomes blood in that brother in that then you are redeemed B of of God the word became blood so make sure make sure you have received the word of God because when that word comes in it becomes blood [Applause] shall I finish here standing in the Gap you know the prophet I I love this prophet he says he came to redeem now to you all know is to bring something back to its original that is amen amen you don't become a church goer you become a [Music] redeemed redeem means back to your original a redeemed person you don't follow every time love one love one another pay your ti do that then he is not redeem because a redeemed person is to his his [Applause] original in his original place don't say to him love one another amen amen he is redeemed all right God bless you brother for amen I'll make sure that uh standing in the let me ask again a question because Adam left for there was a gap now my Prophet tells me the Lord Jesus Christ came and what happened sprinkled blood for Adam Adam there redeemed Adam to come back to a [Applause] redeemed he says when he died and he was buried I love this when he says when he was buried on the third day he came back and he took the end of the St and the end of the to bring it together again my books are falling off here I'm trying to when they thought he is dead he took the end of the and the end of the close that [Applause] [Music] game then he redeemed the man in order to continue [Music] fellowship with the man is that right now we looked at the six that it was Moses and Elijah they opened the [Music] six and what about the seven right amen now did you see here when when he arrived then he began to bring upon [Music] the SS animals and then something in his own image and stopped amen if you are taking a round and you happen to meet somebody who resembles you going to stop okay maybe you are amen amen I'm working on the street and I come against somebody who looks like me who is in my image I will stop amen the mystery what is the mystery of the seventh amen The Mystery of the [Music] six that's the mystery and what is the mystery okay let me read this party and then you will see see this we'll still come to look into it what happens if the seventh seal is not revealed we are going to read the Seven Seals book because he says the seventh ends up the time of all things that's the seven amen I was looking at where it says let us look P the of Amen we'll come to this was this seven and why you say it is not revealed but is he says it was not open to to the public are we the public yeah the seventh not revealed to the public I told you that I was standing with a brother from Sand a certain place and there was a barrier fence there and notice B there amen amen no no what no entry no trespasses no entry Beyond this point entry yeah Beyond this point inor West then here comes a young man straight through the gates now there was somebody doing gardening there we asked him why that one is allowed to go then he said he's a [Applause] son it is because he's a son there's no barrier for him as we are not Sons we are sons and there's no burier amen amen in meeting God if we want to meet God we want to meet God there noer for us as Sons I said to the brother you see brother no barrier for that one is a son but you know we are not Sons we are not allow to go through okay amen right amen that's why there there was this message that says let us look our past the of time when I read that book when I read that book and it says my inheritance is the sunship amen amen which book is that adoption adoption amen hey you don't know the book you are in trouble the book of adoption says our inheritance I quot you is our sship did he say so amen yes that is our inheritance we are Sons but he says we are our inheritance is [Music] our the pastor here knows who he is God said let us make men in our and let them that's why after creating a thing he brings to the man and if the man says you are this God says amen amen because men was a part of the contract the other part of the contract God will do this and send to the okay amen now when the man left that Gap God made sure that the Gap is closed now he can't close that Gap with a [Music] rapit it should be we were there brother sisters we went up what is that mountain Canyon we went up there with the brothers Witnesses and they said you see here that's where the Prophet received a SW you know when Adam fuled the place H where did the SW came from now the sword of the king king sword do you read your do you read your Bible he gave them the sword now the CH it was not the place of the the stood there substitute the place belong I'm going to redeem that man to bring him back to his place that's why today not the CH that are supposed to preach but it should be a man amen [Applause] that's why we have the seventh angel messenger what did he say listen standing in the Gap standing in the Gap standing in the Gap amen it is right here my book standing in the Gap I love this book okay brother why will we have that book yeah yeah yeah yeah you know this is now power of transformation power of transformation what did we Master Masterpiece amen now the power of transform of transformation we are going to standing in the when he was creating he began to bring upon the Earth after creating things B life animals and something yeah we have read this in his same in His image [Music] and St that's the reason when he open the seven sto am amen he stopped only when he comes against his own [Applause] image amen then he stopped all right amen because it was up to his Perfection of what he wanted amen God going after the man who fuled the book that means he was going after his own image because you only he Adam Adam was like God's mirror God would look at Adam he sees himself when Adam left the post then for the first time you could hear the there where are you amen amen he left the place now let's read this and close here is standing in the gaping the Gap it says we find out that all right I I saw this is Page 21 I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid now we'll come to that
