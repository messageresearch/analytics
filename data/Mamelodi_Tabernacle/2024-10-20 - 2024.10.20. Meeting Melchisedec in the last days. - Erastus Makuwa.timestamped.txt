[1:35:51] here um
[1:35:54] in this book uh
[1:35:58] Christ is revealed in his own
[1:36:02] way he says
[1:36:06] here when Jesus was manifested in the
[1:36:09] Old
[1:36:13] Testament as where we have
[1:36:16] read he said when Jesus was manifested
[1:36:20] in the Old Testament
[1:36:25] in a
[1:36:27] theop in the person of
[1:36:33] MEC not the
[1:36:36] priesthood but the
[1:36:39] person the man see for this this man had
[1:36:45] yet not been
[1:36:49] born but he was in aop
[1:36:55] so he had no father and no
[1:36:59] mother he was God
[1:37:04] himself he was manifested in the form of
[1:37:07] a
[1:37:11] man called the king of
[1:37:15] Sal which is king of
[1:37:19] Peace king of righteousness
[1:37:23] he
[1:37:27] was when he start he said when Jesus was
[1:37:34] manifested in the Old
[1:37:38] Testament but where we have read he
[1:37:42] said he said met
[1:37:48] Abraham when Abraham was from the Battle
[1:37:50] of the king
[1:37:54] but the prophet
[1:37:55] says he says it was
[1:37:58] Jesus are you
[1:38:01] together he was in
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:06] a in the form
[1:38:10] of
[1:38:12] Amen Abraham gave
[1:38:16] him ties of his
[1:38:21] spils and then
[1:38:25] gave Abraham bread and
[1:38:30] wi which as we have
[1:38:33] told he gave him part of
[1:38:39] himself he gave him Bread and
[1:38:43] Wine when he was here
[1:38:48] manifested he gave the disciples
[1:38:56] and he promised them this is the last
[1:39:00] one I'm going to eat with
[1:39:03] you this Bread and
[1:39:06] Wine in my

[1:39:13] neither father nor
[1:39:17] mother beginning of days or ending of
[1:39:20] life
[1:39:24] it was Jesus in a
[1:39:28] theop in the form of a
[1:39:32] man could you go to
[1:39:36] that all right amen Jesus was manifested
[1:39:40] in the old
[1:39:47] test in the form of milk in the person
[1:39:50] mil
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:55] the his first
[1:39:58] being we know it and we have we have
[1:40:01] preached about
[1:40:04] it it was the great
[1:40:08] spirit and that great
[1:40:11] spirit
[1:40:14] condescended when it
[1:40:17] condescended
[1:40:20] that that is that is the one
[1:40:24] meet
[1:40:27] Abraham when that great
[1:40:31] spirit when when
[1:40:36] it it formed the
[1:40:40] theop
[1:40:42] Theos the of Angel of the
[1:40:48] Covenant that is what it form
[1:40:54] what Abraham
[1:40:58] met that he says here his first being
[1:41:03] was a
[1:41:07] spirit God
[1:41:10] super you cannot meet somebody you don't
[1:41:14] know I'm trying to introduce
[1:41:17] him so that you can meet
[1:41:21] you because you can meet
[1:41:25] somebody you don't
[1:41:27] know you will meet a WR
[1:41:30] person meet the
[1:41:33] devil and thinking that he is the
[1:41:36] one he came to
[1:41:38] Mar I said to
[1:41:41] Martin worship me I am Jesus he was
[1:41:45] wearing a
[1:41:46] thr
[1:41:49] Mar because he knew scriptures
[1:41:53] because we fight with
[1:41:55] scriptures if you don't know scriptures
[1:41:58] that's why I'm introducing scriptures to
[1:42:01] you so that you can know how to
[1:42:05] fight then Martin
[1:42:07] said leave me
[1:42:12] Satan we are the ones who going to Crown
[1:42:17] Jesus why are
[1:42:19] you already crowned
[1:42:23] he knew the
[1:42:25] scripture but if he didn't knew the
[1:42:28] scripture worshiped
[1:42:33] sat his first was that
[1:42:38] gra and he began to form towards flesh
[1:42:41] we
[1:42:43] know and
[1:42:46] in the weight called the
[1:42:50] weight and the body
[1:42:54] are you together
[1:42:55] with now I will get and he says here
[1:43:00] then then is the state he was when he
[1:43:03] met
[1:43:09] Abraham it was called
[1:43:12] MC it was in the form of
[1:43:18] aop now we get to that and prove it in a
[1:43:22] few minutes
[1:43:26] the Lord willing he was the
[1:43:32] word are you together with
[1:43:35] us Abraham meet
[1:43:38] him we know what happened
[1:43:41] there and then he gave Abraham part of
[1:43:48] himself from
[1:43:50] there we never had anything any more
[1:43:57] about until he became
[1:44:03] Jesus are you together with us then he

[1:44:13] flesh when he when he became
[1:44:17] Jesus and he dwelt Among
[1:44:20] Us in the person of Jesus the of Christ
[1:44:27] himself then that is the

[1:47:23] the son
[1:47:26] of he
[1:47:28] wasc are you
[1:47:32] together it was the Morning
[1:47:36] Light it was the full
[1:47:40] sea in Palestine
[1:47:44] there are you
[1:47:47] with then on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:54] he he
[1:47:56] came and distributed
[1:48:00] himself among
[1:48:04] them then when he himself among
[1:48:08] them let me read here now the Loos that
[1:48:12] was in
[1:48:16] him in who
[1:48:19] Jesus which was the spirit of God
[1:48:25] the
[1:48:26] anointing through sanctification
[1:48:28] sanctifying Grace of the
[1:48:33] blood brought many sons to
[1:48:36] God which is Anointed with the same
[1:48:42] L on the day of
[1:48:44] Pentecost it came down the pillar of
[1:48:49] fire and broke apart like that
[1:48:53] tongues of
[1:48:55] fire set upon each one of
[1:48:58] them not they are tongues not their
[1:49:04] Tong but tongues of
[1:49:08] fire set upon each one of
[1:49:11] them elected and selected
[1:49:16] group identify by this Pillar of
[1:49:21] Fire showing that God had separated
[1:49:25] himself into
[1:49:30] man do you get
[1:49:33] it the
[1:49:35] logos separating himself into
[1:49:40] man God not in one
[1:49:44] person he is in his
[1:49:49] church
[1:49:51] Universal is reason Jesus
[1:49:54] said the work that I
[1:49:57] do shall you also shall you
[1:50:02] also
[1:50:04] more now I know King James says
[1:50:09] greater in the book of in the book of
[1:50:12] King James it says
[1:50:16] greater but the right
[1:50:20] translation is more
[1:50:23] then this shall you
[1:50:26] do God was B and confirmed in one
[1:50:32] man Jesus Christ but now he is bed and
[1:50:37] confined in the
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] whole of the Living
[1:50:45] God that's why they say this why he say
[1:50:50] small we can go back to the
[1:50:54] script on the day of
[1:50:56] Pentecost the Pentecost was an
[1:51:01] altar because what happened in the Old
[1:51:06] Testament it was fulfilled in the New
[1:51:10] Testament it was
[1:51:12] manifested it came into
[1:51:16] being there it was an
[1:51:19] image but now here it is the the the the
[1:51:23] of that
[1:51:25] image that alar in the Old
[1:51:28] Testament it was a second
[1:51:33] altar there was there was fire on that
[1:51:37] Altar and that fire on that
[1:51:40] altar in the Old Testament in the temple
[1:51:44] day that fire was B there by God
[1:51:49] himself and the high priest
[1:51:53] in order to bend the seven
[1:51:59] L he was taking the
[1:52:01] fire from the second
[1:52:05] altar our second altar is
[1:52:16] Pentecost this
[1:52:19] Pentecost p and he will take the fire
[1:52:24] the high priest and then the first
[1:52:29] L when the first stand
[1:52:31] B he will take the fire from that one
[1:52:35] and bend the second one he don't go
[1:52:39] back but he start from
[1:52:41] here and bend this one and take this one
[1:52:46] and B this and
[1:52:49] Paul took the fire
[1:52:52] from this
[1:52:55] altar his church
[1:53:00] age are you together with me then he
[1:53:05] came in three son's
[1:53:09] name he was the son of
[1:53:13] man and he was the son of
[1:53:16] God he was the son of man here
[1:53:24] but he had to make himself
[1:53:29] known because we have got three races of
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:35] people
[1:53:40] listen we come from Three Sons of
[1:53:46] Noah the whole world is populated by
[1:53:49] these three
[1:53:54] then we come to this
[1:53:57] now all those three sons of
[1:54:01] no their their
[1:54:04] Generations is called the
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:08] Gentiles all this
[1:54:10] three they are called
[1:54:13] Gentiles are you together with then
[1:54:17] God choose from the the generation of
[1:54:20] Sam
[1:54:27] choose one
[1:54:28] day which is
[1:54:30] abah he wanted to form his own
[1:54:37] generation the generation of
[1:54:41] worshipers those who will worship
[1:54:44] him three they were worshiping
[1:54:50] Idols but God took one
[1:54:53] in the form of
[1:54:55] Abraham and from
[1:54:58] Abraham God formed
[1:55:03] his and that nation was called the
[1:55:05] nation of
[1:55:08] Israel because they were the sons of
[1:55:13] Jacob Jacob was called
[1:55:16] Israel and they were called the the
[1:55:18] children of Israel
[1:55:22] because their father was
[1:55:25] Israel and they became the generation of
[1:55:29] God the generation which knows who God
[1:55:34] was and God was their
[1:55:37] God that's why he called the god of
[1:55:42] Israel and he wanted to be called like
[1:55:47] that I am the god of
[1:55:50] Israel has chosen this group
[1:55:53] others were
[1:55:58] Gentiles then there is another
[1:56:01] group which was between
[1:56:05] Israelites and the Gentiles that group
[1:56:09] came out
[1:56:11] there which was part of
[1:56:15] Gentiles and part of
[1:56:18] Israel they were called Samaritans
[1:56:24] they also
[1:56:28] claim that God is their
[1:56:31] God they were also waiting for
[1:56:36] messiah we have heard from this
[1:56:39] woman the woman of
[1:56:42] Samaria he said I perceive that thou are
[1:56:46] the
[1:56:47] prophet he was saying to Jesus that you
[1:56:51] are the prophet you are waiting
[1:56:54] for he was saying to Jesus that thou are
[1:56:58] the son of
[1:57:00] man it means the
[1:57:02] Israelites and the Samaritans were
[1:57:05] waiting for the
[1:57:07] manifestation they were waiting for the
[1:57:11] Fulfillment of the son of
[1:57:18] man amen then he revealed himself to
[1:57:23] them he manifested himself to
[1:57:26] them but he didn't manifest himself to
[1:57:29] the
[1:57:30] Gentiles because the Gentiles were not
[1:57:33] looking for
[1:57:38] him but now
[1:57:41] during the seven Church
[1:57:45] ages he came there as a Son of
[1:57:50] God when he was building his church
[1:57:55] here from the
[1:57:58] Gentiles because there is the prophet
[1:58:01] says there was a
[1:58:03] church there was a
[1:58:06] tree which is
[1:58:09] roots is
[1:58:11] Jewish he was talking about this church
[1:58:16] here which was been built from the genti
[1:58:23] but the r
[1:58:25] the was
[1:58:28] Jewish when he was building this
[1:58:31] church he was the son of
[1:58:35] God he was the
[1:58:38] water because the Son of God is the Holy
[1:58:44] Spirit the holy
[1:58:47] spirit is the
[1:58:49] rain watering
[1:58:52] because it was watering the seed
[1:58:57] here and because we need
[1:59:01] water when the seat is still
[1:59:05] growing when the seat has reached its
[1:59:09] maturity we don't need any water
[1:59:15] anymore amen when we have reached that
[1:59:18] place
[1:59:19] there at the end of the seven
[1:59:24] we don't need more we don't need water
[1:59:30] anymore are you together with me but the
[1:59:34] problem
[1:59:35] is when people reach that stage
[1:59:39] there they need to be
[1:59:44] transferred to be transferred into
[1:59:48] this they must be transferred
[1:59:52] that's why the prophet said I went
[1:59:56] West after
[1:59:58] seven I had to went w so that they can
[2:00:02] be
[2:00:08] transferred he came here as a natural
[2:00:13] man explaining these things here but at
[2:00:17] the end of
[2:00:18] this he changed to to the supernatural
[2:00:24] he said I don't know
[2:00:26] this let me go to the W he said because
[2:00:30] of this I had to
[2:00:34] Wi because those he he said I met seven
[2:00:38] angels
[2:00:39] there in a supernatural
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:43] form in a pyramid form they took me
[2:00:47] inside of the
[2:00:49] pyramid where the Mysteries
[2:00:55] amen he was transferred
[2:00:58] there then when you
[2:01:02] fail to be transferred
[2:01:05] here then you come
[2:01:07] back here because here is
[2:01:17] pism because when you have passed
[2:01:20] year then you are a full
[2:01:25] seat but when you are a seat you no more
[2:01:32] need even the gers there even the
[2:01:36] farmers when they when they have sewn
[2:01:40] wheat when the time of
[2:01:44] harvesting they start to stop
[2:01:47] rain they're fighting with rain they
[2:01:50] don't want to see anything
[2:01:54] because the seat has reached
[2:01:58] maturity where are you
[2:02:01] now have you fall are you falling back
[2:02:04] to
[2:02:10] P
[2:02:12] amen because if you are not
[2:02:16] transferred you see
[2:02:20] nothing if you
[2:02:23] you become AAL message
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:31] believer you don't know where you
[2:02:34] are you don't know who you
[2:02:40] are you are a
[2:02:44] worshiper of
[2:02:47] Pentecostalism this age is the last of
[2:02:50] the seven Church ages
[2:02:55] he's talking about
[2:02:57] the which is
[2:03:00] thean
[2:03:02] church is the Pentecostal
[2:03:06] churchur is is the church age which is
[2:03:09] not warm
[2:03:14] C it is Aus the
[2:03:18] church those people that are blind
[2:03:23] that's why the message
[2:03:25] came to call
[2:03:27] me out of this
[2:03:30] confusion so that I can see where I
[2:03:34] am so that I can look
[2:03:36] back oh I shame myor

[2:04:19] blind a person who can go out naked is a
[2:04:23] blind
[2:04:27] person a person who could
[2:04:30] see cannot get out of the house
[2:04:38] naked what began in the first Ephesian
[2:04:43] church and will come to full
