in their invitation cards there should be a a way that one should see that these are believers they believe the word of God so uh you know what I'm talking about those that are about to get married the right way is to discuss the invitation with your parents because they they are your parents they also want to uh appear on the invitation and from there on discuss it with the Elders of the church

amen everyone of us has been given a gift of life it's an investment it's a capital investment to each and everyone of us which one day you shall require an account of it father we pray that what we

joined to thee as we committing everything to th holy hands in Jesus Christ name we pray magnify and glorify holy name amen amen God bless you uh everyone who is alive now God has given him a chance in life to get eternal life today is the day of a wedding so let's start where the wedding started in Genesis 2 21-23 verse 21-23 Genesis 2: 21-23 yes my brother and the the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the reap which the Lord God had taken from men made he a woman and brought ha unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of men amen amen may the Lord bless the leading of his word be seated uh for those of you who have never heard about the message of the hour we are believing the message of the hour which is according to Mali 4: it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and from there you can go to Luke 1730 1 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days when the son of man shall be revealed Revelation 10 in the days of the seventh angel all the Myst of God shall be revealed with that background to tell you something about wedding so when I say talk about the prophet I'm talking about this prophet of Malachi 4:5 take time to know that Prophet because now there are so many prophets but as it was in the Days of Elijah there were 400 Prophets said there not one after there were 400 there's always many always one I'll be talking about this one when I say Prophet I'll be talking about this one of Mali 4: 4 and the Lord caused the man to sleep uh sleep is closing eyes hallelujah amen if I say hallelujah you say amen hallelujah amen and you encourage me if you don't say amen I would know that you're not taking it then I'll take about three hours if you say amen I hear you understand I will stop so if you don't say Amen I'll take about 3 hours but if you say amen amen 30 minutes minutes hallelujah amen so he caused a man to sleep to find a wife so if a man wants to find a wife sleep we are opening our eyes too much on first Faceook our eyes are so widely open until now we can't even know who are we going to marry who going to be our wife or not our wife because too many faces are in our face you can no longer focus on one woman women we looking at and my brother if you go into that state you become confused because the best way you find a wife close your eyes let God give you a wife hallelujah amen so uh When You Close Your Eyes On Your Knees then give you fresh of your flesh remember if they transplant into you an organ which is not compatible with your DNA the day they implant that organ in you you will start rejecting it fighting it the day you get a wife is not part of you that's the day which your peace will disappear my sisters are very good example they always come to me oh brother hey I found a man is a very good zul he loves he can defend me but remember defense is offense how he defends you how he will beat you oh is a a good man he loves but his love does don't have boundary he wants to become a public servant he want to service everybody in the in the community because love has got limits love has got limits hallelujah amen love has limits God gave man one wife God gave a woman one one man even if you are so loving you can't love another man when you married to somebody else hallelujah amen that has to be born of your Bor that fresh of your fresh and as as it is if a man finds a wife finds a good thing God said it is not good for man to be alone that man my brother my sister that man has to be a king in this house whether he's tall whether he's short whether he's small whether educated whether not educated when you come to your house you have to be in your kingdom you can have no peace anywhere else but when you come to your house you want to have P because home is where you are going to lay down and sleep Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen yes that's much better now amen amen so marriage you have to marry like somebody like you as the prophet was talking about here the of Mali 4 5 ver 5 as they were com there BL was coming in was saying you have to love her how she looks because sometimes looks are deceiving because one day you discover that the looks have got no value in your life what you wanted was a friend you can talk to sorry what you wanted was a friend you can talk to hallelujah amen hallelujah uh it happened in a country called United Kingdom unom there was a prince he was called Charles he was looking for a wife and then he found a girl and when he went away his friend took that girl away he went and M married a beautiful woman very beautiful the whole world said this woman is beautiful but they found that Char was still tempted to go back to that woman without better looks but you know in the when when you in a kingdom you don't talk about KFC and disco and what when they in the loyal family they they talk about the quality of dogs how the horses look like is it a breed or is it a half breed so when somebody comes in they become confused you mean people can be talking about dogs the whole day that's the problem with loyalty they talk about things which are useless they don't talk about all Michael Jackson and things like that they they are loyalty and actually they even taught when when you sit you down on a seat don't talk to the person your left you talk to the person when you when you scoop soup from the cup don't scoop it towards yourself you scoop it it's loyalty they have things pertaining to loyalty the same with people of God they got things pertaining to them which doesn't make to the other sense to the other people but makes sense to only those who are of the loyal blood hallelujah amen so uh they didn't go wrong and they divorced and uh Charles went back to the woman which they Contin talking about horses now so if a woman is going to come into a family the woman has to be compatible with a family and if you can take the story of Lea in the Bible I don't have much time have you ever heard of Lea how many of have ever heard of just ra your hand and no no no no I should and then I should read it because a lot of you haven't read Rebecca was a wife to the to son of Abraham which Abraham told his servant which is a representative of the Prophet now the same Prophet talking about to go and find a bride for Isaac but you can see if you go to uh Genesis 24 it's my brother we need to read amen without reading in the Bible the wedding is nothing let's start from the Bible so uh will be yes so if you can go 24 vers three I I'll make the just go read in English I willar by the Lord that's Abraham telling his servant yes and I will make this swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canites among whom I dwell don't marry among the people which I'm dwelling [Music] in because the people which were dwelling in they are the owners of the land and you know the problem with the owners of the land they are still dwell in that country until they forget God amen amen verse four thou sh go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac so he was supposed to go among his Kindred people like him you remember Adam said this is born of my Bor fresh of my fresh they were compatible and here we are seeing the same thing that when Abraham is looking for a wife for his son is looking for compatibility as well and you see when this servant comes to the land which he was sent to uh if you can go um of course uh I I want there some there's somewhere which I want you to read for me amen uh verse 10 ver 10 24: 10 and the servant took 10 camel of the C of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia andto the city of nah uh 12 and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham now this is him praying before he finds a wife hey brothers let's pray before he find a wife a wife is a good thing but another wife is a bad thing a wife is a good thing but I'm telling you the truth uh those of you who have divorced here if I can ask you how was the wife you shall tell me hey brother you never know what I went through but didn't you love yes in the beginning I left her but it turned out because you started wrong you might find each other at a l match at a football match just imagine you you are looking for a wife and you find each other a football match and the other guy is stamping on the other the other one is stamping on the other the other one is kicking the other one and the wife which you are looking for likes that what do you want her to be do in the house so this woman what type of a woman was he looking for let's go to uh verse 12 ver and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham yes go ahead behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the of the men of the City come out to Dr forward and let it come to pass that the dumel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I might drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master Hallelujah uh um you see what the what what is he looking for you remember how many cams were there 10 camels so she he he was looking for a woman who could who could make 10 camels drink okay for example the least the cam can take is 70 lit and there was camels and how how many does a bucket contain 10 or 15 lit but when she he was asking her he asked most the most man can take his one liter at a time he was asking for a one lit yet he needed 700 l so that's how what happens in the marriage ask a woman will you marry me what the woman doesn't know they are marrying the whole tribe and the bad thing which we do we take our best to the wedding we keep our w at home Mama this is not the best we have come here there they have left the family behind you have to cook for all of them they will not even be grateful he as asked a simple ask yet under that simple ask there is a lot of work how many times did that girl land down to the liver to make 10 camels drink and my my my brother uh my sister she made that work to the amazement of the Prophet that girl was able to and he didn't even tell her he just said I need a drink I said I need a drink amen amen they way told you sister but the good thing was this the same animals which she was making to drink where the animals which are going to carry her the same people which are going to give food in your house are the same people who are going to be your people people shall be your people the same Holy Ghost they take care of now the same Holy Ghost is going to take us to the other side oh my brother you better get the Holy Ghost now I don't talk about that Holy Ghost which you go around uh doing all those things which I don't I see people doing now those are spirits what I talk about is the Holy Ghost which you can get and remain normal because Samuel was full of the Holy Ghost he was a normal person El full of Holy Ghost he was a normal person where is this madness coming from to say this a form of the Holy Ghost if you read the the whole Bible people full of the Holy Ghost the bapti was full of the Holy Ghost he never performed drama for people he was a normal person because when the power comes upon you it comes with fullest amen amen so we can see here how the bride was chosen the bride was chosen under 11 ration and that's where most of us are going [Music] wrong you know we I don't know why man thinks that he thinks because uh if you look at the universe now is even as of today if you look at the universe there's no way man can say that he thinks every day we are discovering new things um there was a time which they sent a hobo telescope up there we are seeing quite a lot of things come the J web telescope now it looks as if we were blind we are completely blind they can choose a black spot in the sky in the universe which you can't see anything but when they focus on that one they find they millions of universes just in that SP why are you trusting your own scope you are blind we don't know what is going to happen next so that means we have to find someone who is able to see beyond our what our eyes can see your eyes can only see under spectrum and that Spectrum moves from Blue to maybe to maybe green or red that side after that any infrared infra you can't see anything why are you trusting on yourself yet you can't see anything right away here there are pictures passing through here you can't see them why trust yourself my brother stop trusting your head it's as empty as possible can you tell can you tell an aunt living in this mountain yeah in that mountain there's an ant the whole of its universe is that is that mountain it doesn't know there is a white house somewhere uh there's a Mr Putin there's Mr Bush he doesn't know anything about to God we are just as good as ants sometimes answer are bigger if you can talk about the universe what's the distance you say we are in the solar system from here to the planet Uranus is about 4 billion kilm if you go there L there is diamonds the diamonds which are busy killing one another for it's rain just in our own universe it's just rain amen amen so why choose this life which is just for a time just like a flower you flourish and then the next time you are gone today I want you to choose eternal life which we have found if you want to find thatal life please contact me as I'm going because the way of life is full of choices you can choose to be educated you can choose your Eternal destination you can have a right choice you can have a wrong choice every boy or girl you can choose to live right or to live wrong it's a choice because God gave us one thing to be free moral agents we we can choose our life but we can choose between right and wrong and I'm telling you the truth none of us does wrong here without knowing you are doing choice is a great thing I would want you today to choose right and what did they do uh on on on acts 238 when they heard Peter preaching and asked him men and Brethren what shall we do he told them get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen don't be quiet because if you don't say amen I my brother uh in our faith there's no divorce shall we continue amen good amen so we we have chosen to live a life without divorce we don't mind how many South Africans are going to C to one another how many Americans are divorcing one another we don't us we don't diverse under the same Bible which is used everywhere there's no divorce I believe it's your choice you have chosen her and I believe you are not coed neither were you forced and I believe that in your heart you are settled same to you my sister hallelujah amen choice is a great thing and God was very good to tell us you choose your own wife amen amen you can choose to serve God or not to serve him and you can give all those excuses which you have my brother if this life this life which you can get TB you can get is good how good is eternal life how good isal life if this life full of diseases full of cancers full of I don't know nowadays diseases are so many but yet we move around I say life is good what about eternal life how good is [Music] it my brother is very good I would like to ask you today to choose to serve God amen amen now let me close here because you have been saying amen I'm closing now yes let me close now my brothers um um I'm not here by accident there are people here who can testify that the pastor invited me specifically for this wedding those of you who know can up your hand specifically invited me for this uh by the way I am malaan but uh I've almost grown up here coming and going for some of you this can be the first time or the last time we seeing each other I got something to share with you immortal life I don't want to come to my church my church is in Malawi so I don't want you to be my members but I want you to be the member of a Church of God amen amen I would want you I don't want you to start coming uh can you go down today on your own in your bedroom in your closet can you go and ask God that God I want eternal life on your own I I I don't want to show you a miracle because that those things are crazy they not the miracle the B biggest Miracle is you you are a miracle do you know that you where you are where you are right now you are more than a miracle I'll tell you this had he been your mother and your father were one hour hour late being together you shouldn't have been sitting there there would have been a different person sitting there actually actual time is 20 minutes I I'm giving you an hour but the the actual time 20 minutes been your family your mother and father were early 20 minutes late minutes you wouldn't have been sitting there that's how miraculous you came here on Earth so with all that mirac which happen on you why don't you take advantage today that you get the Holy Ghost after being baptized if I baptize you today even here you can go anywhere else and fellowship because nobody will go to heaven without being colly baptized amen amen sorry I've gone more to the it's not a it's a wedding I should have been telling brother and sister you should be loving one another no no no there's something emergent here some people this will be the last time they will ever meet the message of the hour that's that's this an imery I need to introduce this message to as many people as possible even if it's a wedding so my brother my sister coming back to the two of you I would want you to show to the people what you have believed showing the people what you have believed is living a life according to the scriptures I don't think going to court to divorce one another is living according to the scures because even even the pr scriptures here says no I would want you to live as Abraham and Salah I I would want you to live as Ruth and boas I would want your way are your life to be a reflection of what we have believed amen amen God bless you let me stop [Applause] there um first of all um there is supposed to be a hand over amen uh parents don't come here if not willing to hand over this will be the last day which you are going to askab where were you somebody else has taken over where were you this is now actually you should have been crying because you are losing now amen so if you are willing to hand over please come can I invite the parents to come and do the handovers yeah take take your take your son take your son bring him bring him I no pull him around hold his hands yes good hallelujah amen we should be we should be clapping [Applause] [Music] hands yes um who shall I ask for this woman I'm asking everybody here who shall I ask for this woman to be married to this man [Music] I cannot hear you I want to speak louder because everybody has to hear that it's you who is giving my name is I am the brother

join this man and this woman in a holy matrimony which is commanded by St Paul be honorable among all men my brother the wedding my sister the wedding has to be honorable let this wedding be exclusive it shouldn't be inclusive should be an exclusive marage so it's not to be entered inadvisably [Music] all the advice has been given to [Music] you and if anyone here can show a Just Cause why these two shouldn't be joined together can you say it now or keep quiet until the Lord [Music] comes those of you phones the hands should be down because I want a hand [Music] up okay there's no hand up we are all Witnesses there's no hand up my brother come and pray for us that we should keep quiet until we die so we are closing your mouth forever so my brother will pray for you that that should be so I don't want from today somebody come to tell him about about her you have kept quiet let us pray gracious Lord as we open this service Lord and said we invite you to be with us and really Lord Almighty you came and taught us lot of things now we are in that ccial gracious moment Lord whereby Lord Almighty you showed yourself and as the pastor has been asking here that is there anybody that
