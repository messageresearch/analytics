Behold, I will set you the prophet before the great and dreadful name and We shall the hearts of their fathers to their children. In the hearts of the children to the fatherless bless where Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost with power. Holy Holy Ghost in the wonderful name of our Lord and Jesus Christ. I'm not sure if I'm audible. Can you hear me? Welcome. Welcome. Holy Ghost, we welcome Holy Ghost, we welcome thee. God with power this very we amening one Am I audible? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It looks like we're good to go. &gt;&gt; Let me first start by greeting you in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus. It is yet once more another beautiful morning and we are glad to be in the house of the Lord because this is the house of correction and we are what we are because of this house. H when correction comes, we need to align ourselves. Um you know I saw that the highest office that you find now that is the prophet in the church order he says is the office of the pastor. So it's the highest office with the highest correction. So um in other words um if in this day and age that we are living in we want to be straight with the Lord. You know we need to align ourselves with the offices that he ordained. And then if we do that and then I tell you the truth, we will grow from strength to strength, from power to power. Um we will be transformed. The power of transformation will start to work in us. Um that was just my greeting. So maybe for this morning if we got our Bibles we can go to the book of Genesis we read again verse 1 to verse 5 Genesis 1 verse 1-5 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light, and there was light." And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say a word of prayer for us? Yes. Amen. Yes. Amen. Amen. God bless you. So um my subject uh this morning is just to continue with the message that we had the last time I was here. You recall that we were talking about children of the light and that's I just want us to follow that train and it's because you know I was trying to look elsewhere but something said to me you haven't finished and so um I thought maybe let me come back again because you know when you talk about light you're talking about something that has creative power like we said because that is the first thing that God created and um when you follow uh this light, &gt;&gt; the supernatural one. Now, you realize that it's the alpha and the omega. You'll realize that the whole Bible is centered around that without light nothing could happen. Now maybe quickly let us uh try and recap a little bit just to refresh our memory uh before we jump into the thought. Um and in doing that we read from verse one to verse 5 but also let's read verse I think it's 14 verse 14 it says and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years. &gt;&gt; All right. Um so we've tried to show that there's the there's two lights that we have um is the supernatural light which we found in verse three because it says God said let there be light and there was light. But in 14 talks again that God said let there be lights. So here it's it's plural but where we started it's right. So the one is supernatural one is natural. When you come to the supernatural it's one thing. But when we come to the natural, we find that it's light. &gt;&gt; Now, um putting back in perspective, maybe we can just show quickly that diagram where we were showing the solar system because you recall that we read last time in the spoken word &gt;&gt; spoken word and that spoken word is the cruelty of sin how God &gt;&gt; when he was creating um he he he spoke like I'm starting here in 14 He says, "Let there be lights in the firm in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night." Um so the prophet took us to a trip and in this trip he says to us God when he started to say let there be lights &gt;&gt; the greatest light that there was it was the sun. And he says all these other ones, all these other planets, they actually sprung from the sun, you know, he he he the prophet alludes that this theory of the big bang is not far from the truth. So he says go God spoke &gt;&gt; and then a missile went out &gt;&gt; and then he calls it the linker went out. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that missile that went out, &gt;&gt; it's part of the sun, but it came from the sun and then it went out &gt;&gt; and then when it reached a point somewhere. You know the prophet says this thing happened millions of years. He says when it reached somewhere he said stop and then another missile went out and when it reached somewhere and then he said stop &gt;&gt; and that's how they stopped and they're all hanging in space now he says to us God is so past. Even today when they study this universe. So that which you are seeing now it is just the basic. There are other planets that they discovering that are not listed here just to show how vast God is. There are other stars that are coming up because men is discovering through science and through the tools that they have. They discover other planets. So if you follow them, I don't know where you will end because this thing it just continues, just explodes. Now I want us to pick up something here. If you look where the earth is placed, um, if you can just it again that You will notice if you count from the sun you find Mercury, &gt;&gt; you find Venus Venus &gt;&gt; and then you find Earth. &gt;&gt; So if you count the planets from the sun because now everything comes from the sun. So the first one that came &gt;&gt; which is Mercury Mercury &gt;&gt; it's the first and then we've got Venus which is the second. &gt;&gt; Now Earth was placed on the third because it had to be placed in a perfect spot. Three is a is a number of perfection. That is why God placed it there. Now when the scientists came, they tried to look that because they they see in earth it is the only planet that has got life in it. It's got botan life. It's got human life. It's got water. It's got it is the only planet &gt;&gt; that's got the environment &gt;&gt; that support living. &gt;&gt; Now even today they're still trying to probe which other planet that we can explore and then maybe man can survive there. But even today, &gt;&gt; they haven't found water. Earth God prepared it specially for us to continue with the battle that started in heaven. So we are here not to relax. If you can find yourself relaxed, you must know something is wrong. But if you find yourself on your toes every minute every hour, then you know I'm in the right place somewhere is trying to prove like he did with Job that go and test that one and see what he will do. So that is why you find there's children of the light and the children of darkness. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's how these things move together. Now again &gt;&gt; you will see that there is something special that God made about earth and that special It is because God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; So before he was God, it means there was no one to worship him. But for him to be God, he had to create an environment where now he's going to be worshiped as the almighty God. And he knew that those that are going to worship me, I'm going to give them part of myself. So they are not going to worship me from their own triings. They're going to worship me from the light that I had imparted. Right? &gt;&gt; So remember each one of the planet. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me explain something just to recap quickly and then I get to my as part of my recap. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that &gt;&gt; we had said &gt;&gt; um the earth &gt;&gt; that we live in &gt;&gt; um it's doing two things and one it's called rotation and another one it's called revolution. So it revolves. Okay. Yeah, I think there it is. &gt;&gt; So the first one is rotation. &gt;&gt; So rotation if I demonstrate it so that we are together. It means it does this where it is. It does that. That is rotation. That is the earth. And that we have read it in 14. &gt;&gt; Let me read again. And God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night. So to divide the day from the night revolves rotate. Sorry rotate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. like this where it is it's rotating there's another movement. So the rotation takes 24 hours 12 day 12 night that's rotation. &gt;&gt; That is why in this earth when we are here it's morning but somewhere else it's night because it depends your position to the sun. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then there's another one &gt;&gt; that move it is revolution. &gt;&gt; This is the one. So revolution takes about 365 years. 365 &gt;&gt; give or take that is according to science. Uh but the prophet will come and says this calendar is wrong 30 and we get to what? 360 I think &gt;&gt; give or take. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who do you take? &gt;&gt; I take the prophet. Now the the revolution brings and this is verse 14. &gt;&gt; It says, "And let them be for signs &gt;&gt; and for the seasons &gt;&gt; and for the days and for years." Amen. &gt;&gt; So the revolution revolution it brings as I have right here the seasons. That is why we have winter here. Now we are in summer. &gt;&gt; Right. But where is he told me it's winter? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now all these things depend how you are positioned to the sun. So we get seasons because it depends where are we positioned to the sun. And it also says he put signs this thing that he did it's for signs. That is why we've also mentioned that the first the first Bible was in the zodiac. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because there you'll get the sign, you'll get the times. Today you are spoiled because we've got the clock. But if you can visit the olden people, they used to look for time. They used to look the sky whether it's day or night. Maybe me I can try during the day because I know where the sun sets. I mean it rises and I know when it's midday and I know when it's setting but in the night I've got a challenge. But the olden people they used to go out they will tell you about the north star. They will tell you a lot of things about the signs that are there. That is why the wise men from the east, they saw a sign and they knew that a king is born. They knew that God cannot lie. That is the writing of God. If you see the sign there, that sign is perfect. What's happening there? It's happening here. He made the bigger light to to rule in the day and the lesser light to to rule during the night. You know distinct type, there's a lesser, there's a greater life. Both have ruling power. If you look around during the day, okay, there are works of the night, there are works of the day. You know, when people do the works of the day, you can see that these are the works of the day because there's a there's a greater light. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can see the greater light allows you to do the works of the day. But there are people who are waiting for the lesser light because during the day they can't operate. They wait for the lesser light and then during that light they know that now this is our time. They have works &gt;&gt; of the devil. Um, I once said something that you know in the house if you are troubled by this there's some this um crawling insects They call them maf. &gt;&gt; They call them cockroaches. &gt;&gt; So you'll recall that they are very effective when there's no light. So if you come in the night &gt;&gt; and it's off, it slides off &gt;&gt; and there's a problem in the house. If you say and you will see children of darkness taking cover they just show you they operate better they strive better when it's dark but there are other people that you will see they blossoming better when it's day because they are children of the day, not of the night. They are part of the light, that light lives in them. And that light keeps them in check, even if you gossip about them, they just looking in themselves. Is anything wrong with me? If they still find the light is still there, they cannot be bothered because they have to walk the talk and the talk is the Bible. This is the great light that man ever saw that started there, &gt;&gt; came into the pyramid and came here. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a light. &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Now, in the beginning, &gt;&gt; God created the heaven and the earth. Let me not go there. &gt;&gt; I was just trying to recap just to show you. Um when we talk about the children of the light, how did the whole thing start and starting it before the foundation of the world? &gt;&gt; Now this thing of the this thing has always been troubling me. Um you know about before the foundation of the world In this sense, maybe let me put it correctly, it made me curious more about it because it it indicates that there was a civilization before before this civilization. Yeah. Yes. So before this civilization there was another civilization because that civilization is the one that God &gt;&gt; you know Job was tried and actually job it's just um the devil. Amen. um that went to God um or God knew that &gt;&gt; Job Job is part of the light and him being part of the light because remember I said there's something special that God did about the earth and that special thing is that there is something that's come from another civilization that dropped into this civilization. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Let me repeat myself a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something in this civilization &gt;&gt; that comes from another civilization. And when it's here in this civilization, let's read Job then we combine it. &gt;&gt; Um so that I can get to to the other things here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job 38 again. &gt;&gt; Job 38. &gt;&gt; It says, "Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind and said, Who is this that can counel by words without knowledge? Amen. Yeah. Get up now, th like a man, &gt;&gt; for I will demand of thee an answer thou me. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me try and maybe elaborate something here. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, Job job came to a point where because remember a he was a blessed man. &gt;&gt; He was a man that didn't do any evil. He was living upright. But the prophet somewhere says you know he somewhere Job had he was proud and that is why God came to him now and said to him get up your lines I want to talk to you now and answer me if you And this is what made me very curious because you know as I was reading it I could realize that God has people that were with him before the foundation of the world. That that's why he asked Job this question. Where was thou when I laid the foundation of if thou has understanding? Who had laid the measure thereof? If thou knowest, or who had stretched the line upon it, whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened, or who laid the cornerstone thereof. When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy, it was question after question after question to Job. Job God asking him where were you &gt;&gt; and answer me if you have understanding. &gt;&gt; Now this is what I want to send God needed an answer while he had an answer. He wanted to show job that job I'm in charge here. Um, you must know your your space and and I know my space. Then I started to be curious around this address, you know. Then when I looked upon when I looked closer I saw that actually the whole thing that God is asking it's plain in the creation. If you follow the creation you will see that it's a plain thing. Now um the prophet explains it like this. He says or let me say he interprets it like this. He says before the foundation when we in interpreting it is before the world was formed. Because in my mind I was already looking for some foundation because I've got I've got an idea that the house when you build it you must have you must dig &gt;&gt; and that's the foundation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. you dig that is the foundation. Now I I'm wondering because when I look at the earth &gt;&gt; and the planets &gt;&gt; I see them they in space. &gt;&gt; But the prophet has answered us because it says he spoke something shot out &gt;&gt; and he said stop. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know what's holding everything &gt;&gt; is the word. &gt;&gt; The foundation &gt;&gt; is the word. &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for shovels and other things. &gt;&gt; No, he said stop and it stopped. Now naturally speaking all these planets are held by a magnetic power that's coming from the sun. The sun has got so much energy that it's holding them. The prophet says if one planet was not was out of its cater was going to go directly to the sun and explode. But the magnetic power all these things are coming from the sun. So there's a magnetic power between the sun and the planets. The sun rules over all of them and it's got power to keep them in their position. That is why somewhere here it talks about the line. It's part of the foundation. Some it talks of a line because yeah in verse five verse five &gt;&gt; he says who had laid the measure thereof if thou knowest or who had stretched the line upon it. So each planet has got a line has got a track where it's moving. Are we together? that check &gt;&gt; it's a foundation &gt;&gt; because a foundation &gt;&gt; it's a position that's where you are placed where you are placed you are given a track that your tech is this one now if you look at those texts Mercury &gt;&gt; has got the shortest track maybe let me try and explain in it. When you go to those that run, you go to the stadium when they place them on their tracks, they don't place them straight like this. I'm talking about the relay runners or the sprinters. Are we together? They don't put them in one line. It's because they are tracks. The first track got the shortest distance. The last track has got the fairest distance. &gt;&gt; That is why the first man will be right behind and and and the one on the last track will be ahead. When you look at it, you'll say it's unfair. But they have made the measurements and according to the measurements if they run from here and one starting from here when they end where they finish it's going to be the same distance but God gave different tracks and then if you cross your trackified disqualify number one. &gt;&gt; Even if you are number one, you must keep your track. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in disqualification is is sad. because they let you run the course, but when you get to the finish line, they pull out the red card right at the finishing. So, you better be careful. Whose line are you looking at? The light &gt;&gt; gave them their position. &gt;&gt; Mercury Mercury &gt;&gt; has got the shortest distance. So it means when the earth takes 365 &gt;&gt; Mercury takes short. I didn't calculate it. I don't know how long, but I'm just demonstrating to you that the distance of these things is not the same. Others take longer to finish the same distance because their track is long. Others closer to the sun, they overtake even others. As people we are not the same and equal with another person gauge with what God has given in you that God which has given you will make you to run the pace. You'll speak like Paul. I have run the race. I have finished the course. I'm only waiting. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the cap. &gt;&gt; Because potentially I'm a graduate graduate. Are we together? Amen. That's the the snapshot of or the recap of what we were trying to say last. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now let me come to now. You must know that we are also orbiting around the sun and we not not not the sun. We obbit around the s. &gt;&gt; He gives us, he gave us our tracks, our life &gt;&gt; and he gave us before &gt;&gt; the foundation before the foundation of this world. So this means before this world was you were the things that you see they're not new and if they're not new. You see somebody that not seeing things for the first time is matured. You know if you take yourself and you reverse your life but having the knowledge that you have now I promise you there are a lot of things that when you were young you would have done different your mother was trying to tell you don't take this root and you only Yeah. So, the other one is saying &gt;&gt; I was not there when they were young. Now they want to disturb me. But when you come to that spot and you reverse, then you remember your mother. Hey, my mother told me this. Hey, my father told me, "Look where I am now. Pastor told me this thing." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If if you didn't start here, &gt;&gt; you're not confused by you by youth. in the sense that peer pressure holds you. Amen. There's a certain light that makes you to act different and that make you to understand even in your workplace. They know that there are certain things that this one will never do. Why is because these things are not new. You saw them before and you you opted to take the light or the light opted to take you. Let's put it better. The light opted to take you. And it transformed you to something different to something beautiful to something that you yourself when you look back you have no regrets. You know you say since I repented I don't I have no regrets &gt;&gt; then you know &gt;&gt; I have arrived &gt;&gt; then you don't change &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; okay it is we are children of the light &gt;&gt; who are following the light &gt;&gt; this light that we follow. It's our it's our it's our guide. Let me let me go now to this what I want us to look at the angle today. The other one was just recapping from last but let's let's let's pick up John &gt;&gt; John chapter one and here &gt;&gt; in the book of John &gt;&gt; let's read from verse one to verse 9. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light, which lightenth every man that cometh into the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, so I'm picking up John. Um because this is also another beginning. &gt;&gt; Because it says in the beginning was the way and the word was God and the word was with God. And then in in Genesis one verse one that one says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of creation. &gt;&gt; Now here John picks up another beginning. God has no beginning. God has no ending. But God take a certain form in order for us, in order for human to have an idea who is God. God is a spirit. But being a spirit, he made man. Now he loves this man. Now he wants this man to have an idea of who God is. Now that is why John says in verse one, in the beginning was the word. The word it's a spiritual thing. Are we together? That is why Jesus once said, "The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are alive. Are we together?" &gt;&gt; Amen. So now this beginning it's actually the unfolding of God because God wants he wants us. He he condescend he's condescending to something that is tangible. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why in first John we read that that which was from there &gt;&gt; which we have handled which we have seen &gt;&gt; are we together. So if you take all these things you'll realize that &gt;&gt; God um came to be a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that men &gt;&gt; can understand &gt;&gt; that he also &gt;&gt; is a small god. &gt;&gt; So that men can realize and appreciate that. I am a god. If you can come to that stage then then you are a child of light. &gt;&gt; Okay. It says here &gt;&gt; two &gt;&gt; the same was in the beginning with God. I'll come back and explain this verse. Two. &gt;&gt; Let me read three. It says all things were made by him. And without him was not anything made that was made. Now if you listen carefully you will realize that now the weight start to become him in the beginning was the weight was God the same was God. So the the whole thing is the same. And then he says &gt;&gt; all things were made by him &gt;&gt; is the same. &gt;&gt; I'll come back to that on the issue of the same. So this hymn is now the it's it's actually alluding to the sun the so now um because um the prophet says he was the weight &gt;&gt; which is the logos &gt;&gt; and then when he came down became a man then it says in him was life and the life was the light of man. And the light shined in darkness and darkness comprehended. Do you see light and darkness? Darkness is the absence of light. Then we say it's dark because this the light is not there. But when the light comes, darkness disappears. That is why when a child of God comes, the environment changes because darkness cannot comprehend light. When light comes, &gt;&gt; darkness disappears. &gt;&gt; And not understanding. I was resting here, but someone just came and I'm feeling so weak. My body is aching &gt;&gt; because the powers one is of light, one is of darkness. The power of light does not talk too much, waits for God to express. &gt;&gt; Then it says, There was a man sent from God whose name was John. Now it it's speaking of another man and pastor taught us very well that this man was not sent by was sent from Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Similar as the planets are coming from the sun. &gt;&gt; So John was coming from God. &gt;&gt; It's a he comes from another dispensation. John is coming from another dispensation. Before the foundation of the world, John was there. But at our allotted time, there was a spirit that moved from eternity and it crossed all the planets and it dropped down to John. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that spirit, &gt;&gt; it dropped to John before he was born. vindicating that this is the work of the Lord because Elizabeth was worried. No muscles checking, nothing. But when when when the two lights met in their mothers and then when the mothers greeted each other, &gt;&gt; the heavens ignited and gave life to to John and John. So John when he was here, he was born already predestinated of God. Is there something that you could do to John? You could take him to any university. That was the child of God. God took him to the wilderness himself. God purposefully brought John when the parents were old knowing that the days are numbered and then John came and then when John came God closed the files Elizabeth &gt;&gt; who was the father by the way and Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "This one is mine." &gt;&gt; And then even before he closed the files, John John already loved to stay in the wilderness. And when he was preaching, he was preaching from the wilderness. But because he got the he had the magnetic power, people moved from the cities. coming to the wilderness because of the magnetic power of the light that was in John &gt;&gt; had serious magnetic power &gt;&gt; and even his his um what do you call this thing um you know when you make examples He used nature. &gt;&gt; Parables. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he used parables, &gt;&gt; he used nature &gt;&gt; showing that his university was the nature itself. The best university you can ever find is the natural one. No minis there. &gt;&gt; Let's read about this. &gt;&gt; And then it says, "The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light which lighted every man that cometh into the world. So let me it says here he came for a witness and bearing witness of the light. Now in verse seven &gt;&gt; it says the same came for a witness. Now this is what I said I will explain later because in verse two it says the same was in the beginning with God. Now it goes on again. It says the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light. &gt;&gt; So there you see here &gt;&gt; the light &gt;&gt; it's the light with a capital L in verse seven. &gt;&gt; It's a light with capital L that all men through him might believe. And then it says he was not that light with a capital L. But he was coming to bear witness of that light. But when it started, remember that it says he came from God. So in other words, God gave you gave John a small portion of himself. &gt;&gt; And then that that that one was light, &gt;&gt; but we can't write it with a capital L. We'll write it with a small L. So when it says here, he was not that light. He was not the source. But he was coming to bear witness of the source. But if we put it plain because we are believers, the prophet says if you take a drop from the ocean, just a cup, he says potentially all the contents of the of the ocean in you. Are we together? So John though he was bearing witness of the light but he had the same. So this same keeps on going it is the same the same the same now we are not repeating ourselves. We are processing &gt;&gt; so that we can come to a point &gt;&gt; where we can appreciate what the Lord &gt;&gt; has done for mommy lord. Amen. It's not the making of a man. It's God &gt;&gt; building his own church. Now &gt;&gt; this night that we are talking about &gt;&gt; it requires &gt;&gt; that we become &gt;&gt; a different breed in the sense. &gt;&gt; You see um the um in the natural. There are those that are called astronauts. These are people that study the zodiac and they don't only study it. They even go to the outer space. Now, for you to be an astronaut, you know, you must be good with measurements. Your mathematics must be good. Then they just say condon you. You must pass with distinction to be that. &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, you must be smart. You know, understand measurements. You know, when they talk when they talk about the speed of light, you must understand. And they talk about light years. It's a different language. And we no longer talking when we say light years. We have moved. to another level. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are spiritual astronauts. &gt;&gt; When it come to the word, &gt;&gt; we know the measurements. &gt;&gt; And when we pick you up, we pick you by the spirit &gt;&gt; that's operating in you. because the spirit will not fool you. Now &gt;&gt; these astronauts the astronauts &gt;&gt; um because they they study and they're looking they're not just studying &gt;&gt; actually you know there are certain things that I wanted to read Um maybe I will read it. &gt;&gt; But it's like this. &gt;&gt; Um the prophet speaks the that this world this missile earth. Yeah. inside it. It's got um gas, &gt;&gt; oil, water, h simply put it's explosive cuz he said two of it It's water. &gt;&gt; And he says water. &gt;&gt; It's hydrogen and oxygen. &gt;&gt; Explosive where you were sitting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is this is this is what I wanted my Yeah. He says, "And and the two of the earth &gt;&gt; better than two of it is in water. And oneird of it is in land about one/3 &gt;&gt; and this is little. So it means greater part is water this crust that we are living on. It's full of dangerous explosives, gas, gasoline, oil, everything. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Those of you are in mining, you know, and the two of it. The formula of water, two parts is hydrogen, one part oxygen, explosive. And some says as we are sitting here, below us is hell. There's there's some heat there. If God can open for for us, &gt;&gt; this church would be full. Amen. If you can open for us hell, this church will always be full. &gt;&gt; Now, I was saying to you, &gt;&gt; the astronauts, astronauts, &gt;&gt; it's people that study &gt;&gt; and they studying. Remember these ones are not are not spiritual like us. We are spiritual astronauts. Can I get amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; These ones they are astronauts astronaut &gt;&gt; naturally speaking. Now part of their deal though they don't disclose it. They're actually looking which planet that we can go because rapture is coming &gt;&gt; and hell hell &gt;&gt; is going to be on earth. &gt;&gt; So we need another planet where we can migrate you know to run away from the earth of God. Can you run away from the wrath of God? God made the earth and the earth alone to be habitable. So they actually know that rapture is coming and hell is around the corner. It's going to be here on earth. Now I'm bringing to us that we let me say something about them though that I should give them credit because it's a risky job. So if you know when they go they don't wear in a suit like me they've got a special attire they jump into that one and they've got helmets helmet even if they pass you can see they not walking normal now they don't now walk with this gravity They have a gravity of where they're going. &gt;&gt; They like hopping. You have seen them. Now what they're doing actually there's no guarantee that you will come back. You can go and it can be a oneway ticket. Because &gt;&gt; it is it's another environment. &gt;&gt; Whatever you're using to get there, might not be able to to come and if he doesn't then you're in trouble. Then you have to communicate maybe with the tower down there if there's communication. But this is the credit that I want to give them that they are prepared to take one one way ticket. If you can find somebody who is willing to take a oneway ticket like he took a oneway ticket but because he's a spiritual astronaut. He is in a better space and I must be honest sometimes when I think as a human being I get this thoughts that you know God wherever he is with pastor and the saints he's able to say look at the brethren down So if you know him, &gt;&gt; you know what he wants. &gt;&gt; That is if you know him. Now &gt;&gt; um I'm also ready for one ticket by the way. All of you actually you are ready. That's what Paul says. Paul says if it was me, &gt;&gt; but because I'm still here because I'm still here. But here is here's the thing &gt;&gt; which I want us to look at as we are looking now at the spiritual part of it because the spiritual astronauts their duty is to follow the light and why are they following that light? It's because of the magnetic power. that is in that light. &gt;&gt; It's able to translate us &gt;&gt; into sons &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; You know the translation power, it's something that &gt;&gt; when it hits you you don't have an option. &gt;&gt; It's God himself doing his work. &gt;&gt; Now, let me read uh Colossians Colossians 1 verse 13 just to You can read it for us, my brother. Colossians 1:3. &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 verse 13. &gt;&gt; Yeah. who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. Yeah. Now Paul here's talking about the father you know he says giving thanks to the father which had made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. So to partake it must be in light. You know light is something very great. Even when you want to test um something that is not fake or not fake, you want to test money. you know, they put it under the light. They know that something is going to reflect the paper. &gt;&gt; They're not worried about, but there's something that is like magnetic in the mind. It's more like it's a it's not paper. It's more like it's plastic. &gt;&gt; It's like it's magnet. &gt;&gt; When you flash it in that light, It starts to show something that the imposters the imposters um by &gt;&gt; the imposters &gt;&gt; those that cope. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So that the imposters &gt;&gt; will never be able to emulate it. They don't have the material to emulate that for you to see that. It must be put under the light. If you hold it like this, it's just an it's it's just paper. But if you put it under the right light, it start to glow showing that this is genuine. This is not genuine. So light is able to bring the difference between a true Christian and a make believer because you find make believers and you find Christians. But it is the light that is able to put them under itself under the supervision of the light you will see reflections. You don't have to rush. Take your time and look at it. Then you will see as it moves that this is of God and this is not of God. That that that's how our spiritual part is. um structured. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now, um, in closing, don't forget that &gt;&gt; you were delivered from the power of darkness and translated &gt;&gt; into a kingdom of his dear S. Now in the kingdom of the s that is where there is peace longsuffering praying for one another. Are we together? That is the the the kingdom of the son. Now um let me pick up something that we we read last time in closing. &gt;&gt; Last time when we here we we read the spoken with the seven se I think it was paragraph 43 &gt;&gt; if I recall well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what we read. It says, "You remember the little bitty messengers? They went east. The second messengers a little bit larger. They went east and then I looked. They was with me all the time. That was the first and the second pool. Now the third came from the west sweeping with great terrific speed. They picked me up &gt;&gt; that was coming back east with the mystery of the seven just like it said in Junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret on the inside of the pyramid there was a white stone that was wasn't written on. Let's stop there for a while. So, we we we want to pick up that remember the whole thing we said it's it's aligned. &gt;&gt; It started in the zodiac and then it came to the pyramid and it came in the word form. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet He had a duty &gt;&gt; you know like John John had a duty &gt;&gt; and his duty was that um you must introduce him that why he says I'm not that light &gt;&gt; he is coming &gt;&gt; but H for him to introduce Jesus, he had to see something first and he had to see light in a form of a dove because he says the one that sent me said to me on whom I see the spirit of God descending &gt;&gt; like a dove and remain on him that is him. &gt;&gt; So all along John &gt;&gt; did not know who he was going to introduce he was waiting for a spiritual &gt;&gt; sign. That spiritual sign came. It was God himself in a hallow of light. This hollow of light came down to identify Jesus. As much as it it identified the seventh man is the same hall of life that John saw and he saw it remaining on him. And then when he introduced him, &gt;&gt; he said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What an introduction. &gt;&gt; Only the spiritual people that were waiting for the lamp knew what was happening. Let me say something here maybe. Or let's read Luke 23:45. Luke 3 verse 25 &gt;&gt; 23 Luke 23 &gt;&gt; verse 45 Luke 23 verse 45 and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and 46 &gt;&gt; and when Jesus Jesus had cried with a loud voice. He said, "Father, into thy hands I commit command my spirit." &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, &gt;&gt; if you take the book of Joshua, &gt;&gt; chapter 10, &gt;&gt; that's the one that tells you, &gt;&gt; if you can reflect for us, Joshua chapter 10 there &gt;&gt; on the screen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It says, "And the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon themselves." Is not this written in the book of Jes. So the son stood still in the midst of heaven and has not and and hasted not to go down about a whole day. Joshua &gt;&gt; Joshua if if you read with the other verses there &gt;&gt; was in battle &gt;&gt; and he asked the son stop now I have said to In fact, the sun is not moving. What is moving &gt;&gt; is the planet. The earth &gt;&gt; rotates and revolves. The sun is on the throne. In the throne, you find four beasts, four beings. Four. Yeah, four living creatures and the 24 elders round about the throne. I'm just trying to show you the spiritual setup and the natural setup that these things are aligned. &gt;&gt; Now the the throne &gt;&gt; is there. You know the the pastor put it beautifully. He says one day Why there was silence in heaven? Why there was silence in heaven is because when he moved from the throne to take another throne in in heaven there was silence because in heaven there's always holy holy holy &gt;&gt; in the setup. That is why in Job, one of the questions is where were you when the sons when the stars of God sang together and the sons shouted for joy. So this singing together is the living creatures. They say holy, holy, holy, holy. &gt;&gt; Now um okay, let's leave the set up. Let me let me go to my point &gt;&gt; because we have to close. &gt;&gt; Um I spoke about Joshua &gt;&gt; that Joshua &gt;&gt; came and said son stop. According to science, the sun is not moving. It is the other planets that are moving. &gt;&gt; Right now, let me put it simple again. In our way of speaking, even when we talk, I will say to you before the sun sets, &gt;&gt; have you done one, two, three? &gt;&gt; Are we together? We say the sun is setting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why is because we keep time by the sun but in fact it's not moving. &gt;&gt; It's only the earth that is moving. So in other words I'm trying to say to you when he said son stop it meant the whole solar &gt;&gt; had to stop and then he said son stop because it's naturally for a man to attribute time to the son. That's what we do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me that the earth is the one that is moving? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it it is one man. What manner of man that is able to say son stop you interrupting &gt;&gt; with the solar systemar system &gt;&gt; you interrupting with the milky way galaxy you are interrupting &gt;&gt; with the whole creation Who can do that? &gt;&gt; It's not Joshua. &gt;&gt; It's someone through Joshua and he was able to do that once with Joshua. &gt;&gt; That's what one of the other verses says. It says there was not any other time that God heedened unto a man God listen to a man like he listened to the request of Joshua. Joshua had a difficult request and and when he requested it, he was in battle. He didn't he didn't even have time to pray. He just spoke it. And it happened. &gt;&gt; It said about the whole day. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know when it started. I don't know when it start. What time was it? But the verses the whole day we can say of what was remaining of the day job I mean &gt;&gt; Joshua &gt;&gt; was able to speak &gt;&gt; and it pleased God. &gt;&gt; Now that is why I've combined this &gt;&gt; with Luke 23 Luke 23. Luke 23 says &gt;&gt; Luke 23 &gt;&gt; 45 Luke 23:45 &gt;&gt; Amen. It says &gt;&gt; okay then 1344 it and it was about the sixth hour &gt;&gt; and there was darkness over all the earth until the 9th hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, &gt;&gt; Father, into thy hands, &gt;&gt; I commend my spirit. Now here &gt;&gt; we find &gt;&gt; another Joshua was an astronaut astronaut &gt;&gt; uh because you know so here we find another &gt;&gt; which is the Lord Jesus Christ. So with him there came a time where the fulfillment of why he was here came to meet him. Remember he was introduced as the lamp going to be slain. That's why he's introduced as the lamb. It means he's going to the slaughter, right? to pay &gt;&gt; our price. &gt;&gt; So when that time comes &gt;&gt; and he was there, God also took another form. &gt;&gt; Actually the son the the su darkened This time &gt;&gt; there was no request. &gt;&gt; The son, &gt;&gt; the s &gt;&gt; recognizes who is in charge. The sun was able to recognize my lord is going for crucification. I'm going to put myself on him. And it says the sun darkened. &gt;&gt; So the son was mourning mourning that my lord having done nothing is been taken for crucification and the light had to honor the creator who became man. to say this one I cannot shine anymore. &gt;&gt; It was testifying that the one that you have is the one that created everything. They should have listened to Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein, one of the great scientist who also studied the universe and while studying he had a ambition to the sun. He wanted to reach the sun because he believed that if we can reach there, we can create wealths. He had a revelation that the power that I see here that is the source if I can go there I can create wealth but he realized that and with the small paras that he had he realized that it's far &gt;&gt; then he said if God doesn't put these things in us, we have no answer. That was his conclusion. I'm also saying if God if we don't trust in God, we will never have an answer. We must put our trust in God. God is the one that is responsible. He is the one that will put everything under the light. &gt;&gt; The search light. You know this this light must have the searching power and when when it searches it can find hidden things and when it finds them it brings them to the housetop that's what the Bible says those things that are hidden will be brought to the rooftop so that everyone can see ours is to keep our track where you are worshiping, where you are placed, just keep your tag and and and leave mine and leave his &gt;&gt; No, um I was I was actually on But you see light has got very it's taking me here and there. I was we were reading something that um quotation from the seven se in closing now &gt;&gt; where the prophet says and the angels took me into the pyramid of themselves. The mysteries of God known only to them. And now them was the messengers had to come to interpret. And now here's the thing. Now we are happy you are all aligned. And then Jesus came paid the price. Now we have the seventh man who says there is a mystery and he says there is a white rock that is not written. And then he says these messengers that came they put me in the pyramid of themselves because everything now has to be aligned. You know even the structure of a human being is that of a pyramid. Are we together? Now uh these angels put them there h to interpret to him &gt;&gt; the mystery. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know um when you read about the sins the seventh sin there's always this problem that it's not revealed. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So now these angels were there to make it plain. H maybe let me read this and combine it with who is this melisedc. Who is this melisedc paragraph 22? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 22. &gt;&gt; Then I close. I promise you. I think they can just flesh it there. The who is this mech? Who is this mec? &gt;&gt; Yes, there we go. &gt;&gt; And listen friends, God confirmed his word with signs and vindicates to prove that it's right. The spoken words. Now remember that that light was in the cloud that day. that gave the revelation. &gt;&gt; Then it says, "My little girl was telling me Sarah here." Now let me explain this one quick. It was that cloud that came. Um he says there was a light in the cloud. Are we together? So he says um my little daughter at school they even released them as they were as they were seeing. It was a cloudless day. But there was just this one cloud just going up and down like this. And then they looked at this cloud. They could see that this is something else. Yes, that is the cloud. Then &gt;&gt; even the teacher, &gt;&gt; Sarah's teacher dismissed the class. In my time when they dismissed us, it was only when it was snowing. But this day, it was a blessed dismissal. Because they were seeing something that is an answer to humankind a pyramid of angels. &gt;&gt; Putting a man in itself. &gt;&gt; Maybe let me just read quickly five minutes. &gt;&gt; It says here that school there in Arizona. I was looking up on the clouded sky and seeing this cloud mysteriously in that mountain going up and down with an ember fire burning in it. The teacher dismissed the class and brought them out front and said, "Did you ever see anything like that? Look the way that's there." So, you can see that it's it's God showing that this is the supernatural there's a light up there. Then it says here, remember that's the same ember light that's on the rock. So it's the same God, same revelation. Tell them to do this. So what what I wanted to bring here is that it is the same God that God that said in the beginning I mean Moses said in the beginning said let us create that same God became a hallow of light and and the prophet here he calls it an amber light on the rock because now this remember this rock is not written but it needs to be interpreted. Have you seen such a thing? people interested in a rock that does not have a life. That tells you there is something that this these angels had to utter for that for that utterance to happen they had to give brotherham a revelation. Then once he has a revelation because that's what it says. So it's the same God, same revelation. So once he picks up the revelation and then it means now he has seen the writing on the rock. It's a rock without the writing. But when the light comes, you know, like Moses when he went up the mountain, took two table stones, writing through fire, through light, he had to write the ten commandments. Those stones were not written. But when he came back from the mountain, there was a writing. Now, brother Benham, &gt;&gt; when he came out from that constellation of angels, &gt;&gt; he came with the interpretation. First revelation, second interpretation. Then when he comes to interpret, he's interpreting us. God bless you. Thank you so much um for being such a good audience. It is through your prayers that you are able to have this environment and may the good Lord. May he strengthen us as a church that we may be able when they look down on us, they can be proud to say this is what we taught them. So let me hand over to you go maybe you can just um say a song and um I give to our MC and God bless you. Oh, the more that I love him, more each day. S like heaven overflow the Lord now rise. &gt;&gt; Hello God. The Lord &gt;&gt; the sweet &gt;&gt; the more that I love him. &gt;&gt; The more that I love more &gt;&gt; each day is like heaven.

God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to baptism. &gt;&gt; God has spoken to us. &gt;&gt; And we are happy. Amen. as I'm going to request my elder there just to come and pray for us after the word. It reminds me this song that sings. When I remember when I will I will never go back. When I remember, when I &gt;&gt; was the Lord, &gt;&gt; I will never forget. &gt;&gt; I will never go back anymore. What the Lord has done, &gt;&gt; I will never. &gt;&gt; They say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I will go back. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mighty God, the greatest one this morning, Lord Almighty, each and every one of us, when we woke up, we knel down and say, "Father, we are going to a meeting. We're going to a service to hear your word. &gt;&gt; Therefore, Lord, after that word, we with our heads bowed, &gt;&gt; we would like to thank you, Father. You gave us a substance of things that we are hoping for. You gave us an evidence, Lord Almighty. &gt;&gt; Of the word, Lord Almighty, that was the one that created us. We like to thank you, Father, for honoring us as we have honored thee. There was a day when your son said, "Father, praying Lord," in the book of John 17, he said, "Glorify me so that I could glorify thee, Lord." And today, Father, now that you have glorified us, we give that glory back to thee, Lord. because thou knew better than us. &gt;&gt; You knew us Lord before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And you knew the Lord Almighty that a day like this will come and father you know when this day comes how should we behave and how should we react. We like to thank you father for the mercy and grace that you have done onto our life especially lord almighty the word that is relevant &gt;&gt; to our time. Thank you father. Bless our brother here Muketi for standing behind this pullpit and Lord Almighty preaching to us through your inspiration and through your anointing. Bless this church Lord Almighty that you open Lord Almighty a ground and open up a heart that could receive your word. Lord, &gt;&gt; there was a time where the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the scribes wanted to kill you because you said you were there before Abraham was. and gracious heavenly father, here we are this day, Father, being recognized as the seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; standing here, Lord Almighty, opening our hearts, you said to them, you want to kill me because my word has got no place in your heart. Father, we are so thankful because your word has got a place, Lord Almighty, in our hearts. Therefore, bless your church, Lord. Bless everybody that is under this roof, Lord Almighty. As they will be going out, bless them, Lord Almighty. Sanctify them. &gt;&gt; Give them Lord Almighty, the request of their hearts. &gt;&gt; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we prepare for the baptism, our brother will just lead us. God bless you. again. Get sitting head on our way on our way in empty. Get together. We are single city. This is our way. Heaven sh of our way of our way. sitting in Morning. Somebody Who are you in our city? I'm a You on my side to my Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; At this time, Basalan, let me just request our elder just to come and pray for us shortly before we go to the word. Amen. And then our brother will come with the word. God bless you. Amen. Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly father. We glorify your name. We honor you. We salute you for the great word that spoke we spoke to us this afternoon. Father, we come to you with this great service through the mouth of the prophet. You taught us that it's so important to be baptized is for us to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here we are today fulfilling the very same scriptures that you spoke since in the beginning through the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel when they went out from Egypt to the promised land. There was that pillar of light, Lord, the supernatural light. And your word says all Israel were baptized under that cloud. And you told Moses that they must not cry, but they must speak. That Moses can speak the word and they'll cross over. And the Bible says they were all baptized in that pillar of fire. They were baptized in that Red Sea. And that was typing the baptismal of what we have today. John saw that dove, that spirit of God coming upon Jesus and he said, "Let us fulfill all righteousness." John was worthy to baptize Jesus because he was going to be a sacrificial lamb. And in the last days, Father, you make a way for us as your children, that each and every one of us who repents and be baptized, you will come in, Father. Here are the souls that are standing before us. They've received your word, Lord. They are now identifying themselves with thee. As they are going in to be baptized together with those brothers, we'll be baptizing them. Lord, we believe that the same God who created all heaven and earth will come inside them, Lord, to make them sons and daughters of the living God because they were children of God before the foundation of the world. Today, they are standing here to identify themselves with the word that was delivered in this last days. Bless each and each and everything that's going to be done right now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he hath crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. All &gt;&gt; true to Oh, you us. &gt;&gt; Where is joy? glorious Jesus Christ. A &gt;&gt; love true love. &gt;&gt; True love. We'll request our preacher that the Lord just to come and pray. God bless you. Let us pray. Dear heavenly father, once more Lord we are so grateful and thankful that you called yet another souls because the time is drawing near that we will be no more in this earth. Father, but you are calling one by one those that belong to you. Heavenly Father, it is a waterway. As we have seen before you went to Calvary, you also had to be baptized by John. Here the two father, they also take the same step of realizing that it is a waterway indeed. We ask father that uh from henceforth be with them. We know the devil he's not happy and he will come and entice them with the things of this world. We know that the things of this world look beautiful to a natural eye. But father give them the spiritual eye that they may appreciate you more than the world. Father, it's such a great price that we have paid and we are grateful that the young are coming. Father, we ask that you bless the service that has been rendered of baptism and father your children that came also just to be blessed by you through your word. Father h continue to be with us and guide us as we are pilgrims in this world. Really father we ask all these things knowing that you are the one that have overcome and you bought your church through your blood and father we are grateful to apply that blood and we we say apply it to the two souls as well. Heavenly Father, we ask all these things believing in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. willing. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
