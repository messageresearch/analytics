Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation vol.4
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 10 March 2024.

Text:  The Pyramid of The White Rock 

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 19:11-13 & 14-15 | Revelation 2:17 |  Ephesians  4:30 | Revelation 4:1 | Revelation 12:10-12

To preach to the eternal people it comes with a blessing because he is not a stranger to the word. In each and everyone of the predestinated Son and Daughter of God there's a white stone.

Somebody who is predestinated his expectations from God is all things. If you want to worship God it should be the God who will never fail.

A real Christian is a founder. I want to worship where He is. I want to worship where God can tell me all things. A Christian is made of all things and that is the word. If you don't change to be up higher you remain with a mind that you are a christian. 

If you are in line with God He will always bring you to the heights. A real christian is somebody who wants to see God. If you are still doing your things you are not prepared and you do not have the revelation of the rapture.

Since we left the church ages we see things. After the Church ages the pyramid change to be the pyramid of angels. The lord Jesus is talking to the people whom are made in his image.

amen amen uh did we greet our brethren in cap P Elizabeth Elizabeth they are with us this morning but physically they Elizabeth but in spirit we are together more amen all right amen you know there was a you may take oh sorry one there was a sister I can't recall where I used to go for to worship uh every time the sister was coming from Davon years back uh every time I was still a young man all right but a strong amen amen before the cells were introduced cellones and whatever has come with their cell phon amen a terrible thing if it is in the hands of somebody is not predestinated because a child of God it's an eagle an eagle don't just eat it's a majestic amen amen so a child of God is an eagle all right now I was trying to say she used to sing this song uh what reminds me of this story I've never heard someone singing that song all the time when I see it I knew this is the song she's going to sing amen let's sing it [Music] together [Music] [Music] [Music] he so [Music] [Music] ch [Music] [Applause] amen amen yeah amen the brother means it really since that I've known that I've never heard singing any other [Music] and let us with today tomorrow and forever let's go back to our scripture uh we have our brother to to read we also read Revelation chapter 19 ver 11 to 13 verse 11 to13 and uh and my promise is that I won't beong unless he decides okay amen Revelation 19 ver 11 to13 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vure dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Amen did you hear it what is his name that is his name okay amen all right amen the next scripture chapter 2 Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to e of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it God Amen okay amen you may be seated God bless you all right amen and uh uh you've been here for since this morning and now I will just read some few things but you know to preach to the Eternal people um it comes with blessing amen because an eternal person he or she is not a [Music] stranger to the word of God as the Bible says you were chosen where in him I wonder if somebody has considered this for you were chosen in him amen as another scripture says what does that scripture say uh Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 amen Ephesians 4:3 as he hasi says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption now the day of redemption do you still uh remember that the day of redemption is the day the book was open amen amen the day of redemption now there are some people here and elsewhere who who are redeemed already for their names are written in the Lamb's Book of now according to Revelation 5 the Bible says uh there was this one set Throne or in the throne and uh with a book in his amen amen and when I read this part maybe maybe one day you will hear it it says the lamb took the book within himself that's why in each and every predestinated son or daughter there is a white stone that's why there was the samarit woman and before even the Lord appeared in this body she was going around saying I knowah and he will tell us all things because somebody who is predestinated is expectations from God is All Things is healing amen amen just say this healing power my comes from the blood say it just once let me hear amen healing power come from the blood it never right saving power comes from the blood it flows eternally amen amen sing these songs unto us you sing these songs unto us amen amen healing power from the blood and it will never fail if you want to worship God you should worship The God Who will never fail you that's why I can't go elsewhere to worship I worship where I have seen [Applause] God so I can't change to another God to me there's only one God since Jesus you know we used to sing since Jesus came into Jesus came came into my heart of Joy oh my soul like a [Music] Bel Jesus came into my are you sure of what you are saying [Music] [Music] amen [Music] by so doing I'm preaching amen okay amen now we have two scriptures here [Music] um the first one says I don't have my Bible with me here I don't know oh it is here amen the first one was revelation chapter 19 chapter 19 verse 11 verse 11 this scripture uh you know last I asked a question about the Battle of today uh things are happening and I don't know how many here can say uh they have seen the prophet all the prophecies fulfilled amen they've seen the the fire of Lord the water of of the time of Noah the fire in the time of Lord have you seen all those for they asked the Lord the sign then he said uh yeah as it was so shall it be all right amen now this scripture here I asked was it a brother or brothers about this scripture 19 ver 11 and I saw heaven opened there were some people in the Bible who are so blessed like Steven when he was stoned he saw heaven open amen amen amen and he saw him on the throne amen amen and now here it says uh and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful true and in righteousness he does Judge as I ask a question you have what we call the Battle of amagon which is much on the lips of the people and I'm so glad that H since we arrive amen amen you know there are people who arrived here in him and can never change for another place amen amen because once in Jesus you can leave that place we have found him amen amen you remember in the Book of John how Philip and them who were waiting for the coming Messiah all right amen and the Bible says who said who was responsible for this day we have found him I I I I don't know how many Founders are here because a real Christian is a Founder that's why so sorry for singing during this [Music] amen I will never go elsewhere amen amen so that's the real Jesus okay amen now here the scripture says uh and I saw heaven open you know of John uh is that John who saw heaven and the the voice said come up and I will show you things to come these are real men of God God said to Moses one day tell this people that I have spoken to you from heavenu you remember that scripture I have spoken with you from if we can worship God in such a place where a speaker can say God has spoken to me from Heaven amen amen amen as about that woman do you remember that it says when that woman said what you have said is the truth and the prophet of God said God spoke continue amen yeah God spoken her her heart what she said the Samaritan women say I know Messiah coming when he has come he will tell us I Want To Worship in such a place instead of here here a bit of the of God tomorrow I go to that church pick up some no we want to worship where he is that's why the woman said I know and now keep this word I yes you should know amen I come here because there's something I know and that thing that knowledge keep keeps me coming because I know amen and that woman said I know mesiah is coming and when he has come he will tell us all things she knew already that what she has heard is not all all things but she's waiting for somebody will come to tell her all things and I want to worship where God can tell me all things [Music] amen a man was asked a leader in the church when are you going to preach the seven seies and he said I don't know them now I couldn't Worship in such a place because every time the word is preached then I would know it is not all things a Christian is made of all things which is the word of God Amen that's why a Christian don't hit this pole and that PO and so for since Jesus came into she is settled amen that's why I'm let me read I saw heaven open some people worshiped in this way where sometimes you can see heaven John also the words came to John said come up here and I will is that Revelation chapter 4 come up here and I will show you things to come brother somebody don't know that scripture just read that scripture Revelation 4:1 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter amen uh was it a man who spoke those words the man who says the man who has received the word from Heaven who is that man or is a man like me and you then I'm glad that if John received not like a telephone call but a voice he clearly that said come up yeah did he Book for a flight okay amen it was a direct come here and I will show you now when I approach the prophet he says it was from the church ages Church ages speak of time but after church ages that's why we speak of Angels the pyramid has changed from being a pyramid H but into a pyramid of angels we were sharing about it again amen all right amen that that is he hey hey the message is not just Jesus is alive Jesus can heal Noh this is the gospel here come up here and I will amen am that is God speaking to a man like you because this man was a member in the church he was coming through the seven Church ages churches like me and you if you don't change to come up higher you end up with the mind of being a Christian but it works indeed in your mind you are not a Christian CHR that man was in fellowship with God until God lifted him up powerful amen if you are in line with God God will bring you always to some high amen amen amen remain in him remain in his way amen amen and you'll see him uh I know a real Christian is somebody who wants to see God Amen you see we are talking about the Rapture now the Lord is coming signs are there I have seen them I'm satisfied that the Rapture is here amen amen so a real real Christian today his mind is only about the coming of the Lord amen because that's theing in you know the song [Music] says he's beyond all the dimensions uh like you can't find God through a cell phone and you are quiet maybe you know something about can you God never said he will communicate with you through a cell phone but he said through the Holy Ghost and by Revelation you know what is revelation the people that are on the way home they have received that Revelation it's not just a scripture no there's something in the heart of a man that has put him that reality that Jesus is coming amen amen that's why the Samaritan woman she didn't just quote scriptures the pastor says but she said I know mesiah is coming it's not just what the preaching is all about but me personally I know that mesiah is coming and I even know that when he has come he will tell us all amen I know we know that the Rapture is coming amen amen amen and you know if you know something about something from God you don't argue with those who don't know amen because that woman it was revealed to her Messiah is coming amen amen and she didn't dispute she only said I know you know I love this me personally I know now if he knows who else can tell her the difference she knows if you know that the Rapture is coming who can tell you like a brother said to our brother yes the Bible says he's coming but hey it's just that you too too forward yes we also believe he's coming the way you are you are too much because she was not prepared if you are still doing your things you are not prepared because you don't have the revelation of the rapture only the people with the revelation of the rupture prepared themselves amen because already they are in there Supernatural area you know it is like this every time you expect to to be taken amen he didn't give us the year or the week or but he gave us the Revelation amen so much that when I woke up when I wake up in the morning I wake wake up expecting to be taken away a person at the airport he has prepared everything bought the ticket went through checking points then the last thing he's just waiting he makes sure or she makes sure that everything has been done is just to wait you'll see him checking every time there watch just like us [Applause] we have our not rest watch but he said when you see this and this and this and this know that the time is but you'll wonder some people don't see that because they are not on the waiting list they are not going amen if they were allowed they could say Lord please don't come now we are still busy I still want to throw a party for my children but the people from heaven right now there's something bubbling in that's why the Bible says Enoch walked with God Amen he walked with God pleased God so much until God took him away the Bible says he pleased God can you please God he walked with God God let us read this the first scripture that's why I read that also uh 19 I saw heaven open Chapter 19 Verse 11 Revelation and I saw heaven open and behold white I understand white is the original color and he that set upon him was called faith for True in righteous does judge and make war amen that's when the Battle of aedon is coming and I have read to you that part where where it says the battle of was fought started [Music] when amen and in from Heaven Lucifer Lucifer the worshippers of Lucifer they call him father that's right amen is brother Victor here all right one day they told me about a sister I won't call names that they have been wait looking for that sister they were looking for that sister she's a family member then I think it was for three weeks then I I prayed with them then one day uh I'm not saying I'm talking you know when God speaks it's is to somebody who will hear him amen right amen God won't speak to you [Music] unless he has given you the faculty Royal hearing for the child of God don't just hear like that but he or she has a royal hearing now I know many things that we go through they are disputed people don't believe them but do do you really believe that what is saying is there one was telling me that got a witness on on that there's no underworld all right amen she's a woman there's no world just like somebody say there is no God we came through Evolution amen I was somewhere in the Lim or what there was a sister uh we were Seated on the back side of the house now there was a a a brother teacher he was just visiting the place now he spoke to one of our sisters I don't know how it started but I I could only hear when he said do you believe that there's a Garden of Eden the sister says yes then he said can you explain that can you show me the sister said it is in the Bible but he said can you prove it and I said to the sister sister this man is a scientist don't waste your time he's a scientist he doesn't know God like I was called aside by my father-in-law at a certain place we were there it's a school now he was standing there with about five school boys I was just passing there we were holding a service at that school he said hey my son-in come here I said yes Daddy he said these boys uh but they are saying uh man was an ape TR and I could see that they are really determined that yes a human was a an a father when my father was talking they were saying yes
