[1:41:55] had a
[1:41:58] dream now you all know about his
[1:42:05] dream we will follow these
[1:42:12] things because the message

[1:42:22] beyond uh
[1:42:24] the church
[1:42:27] ages do you do you know
[1:42:31] thaten okay I was reading something

[1:42:52] says
[1:42:54] uh your
[1:42:58] body you all know what is
[1:43:04] the amen amen because you have a body
[1:43:10] that is subject to the word of
[1:43:16] God this other
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:22] body
[1:43:25] and all that it's
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:30] just amen
[1:43:32] amen but
[1:43:34] if we don't have
[1:43:42] the we
[1:43:44] lack we are
[1:43:46] behind because you we don't have a
[1:43:52] body
[1:43:54] like if we don't
[1:43:58] have you can't you can't take the word
[1:44:01] of
[1:44:03] God that's why it says you have
[1:44:09] heard not you are going to
[1:44:16] hear and you have heard from
[1:44:22] your
[1:44:26] it's
[1:44:32] something your
[1:44:39] hearing there's different kinds of
[1:44:45] Senses there's hearing of this
[1:44:51] ears now
[1:44:54] with your brain and all
[1:44:57] that now that cannot receive the word of
[1:45:08] God why before God could put you into a

[1:45:18] called the theop theop
[1:45:21] amen amen
[1:45:27] amen the body it is called a body
[1:45:32] subject to the word of
[1:45:37] God all right amen now let's read this
[1:45:42] just
[1:45:43] for H looking at the
[1:45:49] interpretation of the white
[1:45:56] Stone last night we were talking with
[1:45:58] the
[1:46:01] brothers as we were going through some
[1:46:05] things amen amen and uh we realized
[1:46:11] that we're
[1:46:15] asking looking for the answer from
[1:46:21] God because
[1:46:24] today we do
[1:46:27] need a supernatural
[1:46:33] answer
[1:46:35] amen the whole world is so
[1:46:39] confused with all its education
[1:46:45] systems we are building big universities

[1:47:01] somebody but that
[1:47:04] somebody is the one who was there
[1:47:12] before before your
[1:47:16] existence because without him we don't
[1:47:21] exist
[1:47:26] that's why he
[1:47:31] said besides
[1:47:33] me you cannot do anything amen you
[1:47:39] know if we were to believe
[1:47:46] God we would know that without
[1:47:51] him myself I I know I know that without
[1:47:55] him I'm
[1:47:59] nothing that's why he
[1:48:01] said You shall
[1:48:03] live because I
[1:48:08] live I am the
[1:48:12] life amen
[1:48:16] amen can you buy Life
[1:48:21] somewhere the Lord Jesus

[2:01:53] me something to think
[2:01:57] about the
[2:01:59] brother is
[2:02:01] discouraged and he was
[2:02:05] discouraged because he
[2:02:08] saw the
[2:02:10] grave and he thought he was
[2:02:14] thinking of all the things he was trying
[2:02:16] to
[2:02:19] achieve after after all
[2:02:23] that after all the
[2:02:27] efforts am I coming

[2:03:17] way amen and the word
[2:03:25] was now you follow
[2:03:29] it he came as a in the form of a
[2:03:35] man when they killed him on the third
[2:03:39] day he was back on
[2:03:43] duty because they killed
[2:03:46] the but not not
[2:03:50] God you can't kill the Lord Jesus
[2:03:54] Christ you can kill the
[2:03:59] body but in 3
[2:04:02] days he was back with his
[2:04:08] followers he that was
[2:04:12] dead is now
[2:04:16] alive that's what he came for to give
[2:04:19] you eternal life
[2:04:23] amen amen because he says if you believe
[2:04:27] in him you shall never see
[2:04:32] death amen okay now did you hear that
[2:04:38] scripture if you believe in him you
[2:04:42] shall
[2:04:43] never see

[2:10:05] feral let's come
[2:10:07] here the white
[2:10:11] stone now this
[2:10:14] astronauts asona um they thought that
[2:10:18] the only thing we can uh show to the
[2:10:24] people from the unknown
[2:10:28] Moon because they have never been
[2:10:31] there now afterwards I know there were
[2:10:34] stories that they didn't really reach
[2:10:37] the
[2:10:39] mo this is just a
[2:10:43] type let's have
[2:10:45] something to
[2:10:48] introduce and they came with a stone
[2:10:53] now I read here that you will be given a
[2:10:58] name a white
[2:11:01] stone and what what
[2:11:05] continue in the stone a name
[2:11:08] written a stone written a name written

[2:11:33] know but you
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:38] yourself amen is that right amen we'll
[2:11:41] come to that but now I was looking at
[2:11:45] this part also here a special
[2:11:49] name which know it but
[2:11:56] you you know that in you there is
[2:12:01] something amen am you can compromise on
[2:12:05] many
[2:12:06] things but not on this special
[2:12:10] thing you know that's why when talking
[2:12:14] about
[2:12:17] hearing you have
[2:12:19] heard from your
[2:12:26] amen one would
[2:12:29] ask that
[2:12:34] woman i' I've heard you
[2:12:39] say I
[2:12:41] know I know
[2:12:44] what the Messiah is coming how did she
[2:12:49] know amen because the others didn't
[2:12:53] know all right amen
[2:12:57] some they they could say to her H yeah I
[2:13:01] have read the Bible it says Messiah is
[2:13:05] coming but now she
[2:13:08] says I
[2:13:10] know you see it's a different thing from
[2:13:14] some somebody who
[2:13:16] says the Bible
[2:13:18] says Messiah is coming this one is very
[2:13:24] personal I
[2:13:32] know how do you
[2:13:35] know amen amen so so as we are here each
[2:13:40] and every one of us here know
[2:13:45] something beautiful amen amen you know
[2:13:49] that that's like a white
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] Stone now we here don't worry we are
[2:13:58] still going to run
[2:14:01] this in
[2:14:03] series yeah because anyhow we have
[2:14:06] passed the seven Church
[2:14:10] ages we are beyond that if you go beyond
[2:14:14] that because seven Church ages speak of
[2:14:19] time now if you go beyond
[2:14:22] time uh now what you know is something
[2:14:28] that was put in
[2:14:32] you not in the
[2:14:36] book you remain with something
[2:14:41] special amen you know that that woman
[2:14:44] was not going
[2:14:46] around opening the
[2:14:49] Bible the Bible says Mah is coming no
[2:14:53] she became an
[2:14:57] announcer this coming
[2:15:01] messah
[2:15:03] I you know it must come to where you can
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:13] say when it is now in
[2:15:18] you amen all right amen now and
[2:15:24] then yeah I was reading this
[2:15:28] P we still going to amen carry on Amen
[2:15:32] because this morning we were
[2:15:35] asking we're talking about this
[2:15:40] thing that Revelation
[2:15:44] Chapter 2 19 oh Chapter 19 Verse 11 vers
[2:15:48] 11 it says and I
[2:15:51] saw heaven
[2:15:55] open it's something
[2:16:02] special and when ask people what do you
[2:16:04] see say I just see
[2:16:05] clouds but this one
[2:16:08] says
[2:16:09] Heaven
[2:16:12] open and
[2:16:14] behold a white
[2:16:17] horse because we are told that white is
[2:16:22] the original
[2:16:25] color white
[2:16:28] horse and he that set upon
[2:16:32] him was called
[2:16:35] faithful true in righteousness he does
[2:16:39] Judge
[2:16:43] any this man was looking at
[2:16:47] that he saw that his eyes were as flame
[2:16:52] of
[2:16:54] fire and on his head were many
[2:16:59] crowns and he had a name written that no
[2:17:04] man
[2:17:05] knew but he
[2:17:09] himself we will we are going to follow
[2:17:11] these things to your
[2:17:14] name known only to
[2:17:17] you known only by
[2:17:19] you
[2:17:22] amen amen and then he said and he was
[2:17:26] cluth with a vesture dipped in
[2:17:30] Blood and his name is called the word of
[2:17:39] God amen amen now the word of God this
[2:17:44] is I've got a Bible here and we say this
[2:17:49] is the word of
[2:17:52] God but there
[2:17:54] is the word of
[2:17:58] God Amen not in letter
[2:18:02] form is that right amen this is in
[2:18:05] letter
[2:18:06] form you can read
[2:18:11] it and then afterwards you get offended
[2:18:14] by
[2:18:15] it but there is the word of
[2:18:19] God
[2:18:23] amen now that one you cannot because
[2:18:27] pass it that's why they say
[2:18:31] theop is a body a body
[2:18:36] subject to the word of
[2:18:41] God there's no faculty in you that can
[2:18:45] keep the word of
[2:18:46] God but it is only your
[2:18:49] theop
[2:18:51] amen now if you don't have
[2:18:53] the you can hear the word been preached
[2:18:57] but you can't keep
[2:19:02] it because it is only
[2:19:06] the keep the way because the itself is
[2:19:12] the
[2:19:14] way okay now listen here says his eyes
[2:19:19] were a
[2:19:21] flame
[2:19:23] of and on his head were many
[2:19:28] crowns he had a name
[2:19:32] written that no man
[2:19:35] knew but he
[2:19:40] himself all right amen and he was cloth
[2:19:44] with
[2:19:45] vure de in
[2:19:48] Blood and his name is called
[2:19:51] the word of
[2:19:54] God amen amen yeah we are looking at the
[2:20:00] Bible with some
[2:20:03] letters and we say it is the word of
[2:20:08] God but here we are looking at the word
[2:20:11] of
[2:20:12] God his name called the
[2:20:17] name the word
[2:20:22] of God
[2:20:24] Amen all right amen now you can keep the
[2:20:28] word of
[2:20:29] God
[2:20:32] only can keep the word of
[2:20:36] God Amen because in your body there some
[2:20:41] lust and all those
[2:20:44] things the word can live in that
[2:20:48] condition if it is the word of God all
[2:20:52] these others
[2:20:56] die all right am no
[2:21:00] last
[2:21:02] amen wherever you are
[2:21:05] going you are
[2:21:09] singing you
[2:21:10] know they were telling me last night
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:18] that say you
[2:21:25] forward this Rapture
[2:21:28] thing we know yes not the way you are
[2:21:34] are like it's too it's too
[2:21:38] rush
[2:21:41] why no he has a problem with the Rapture
[2:21:44] it's not ready at
[2:21:46] all you know I'll tell you there are
[2:21:49] people living here
[2:21:52] that are willing to
[2:21:56] go because this world is not their
[2:22:00] home they are pilgrims and
[2:22:04] soers amen
[2:22:07] am longing
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:17] fors we'll take it from the book of
[2:22:19] Hebrews
[2:22:21] like
[2:22:22] Abraham looking for a
[2:22:26] city
[2:22:28] then he was not just looking for
[2:22:31] it he started
[2:22:35] off to the
[2:22:38] city
[2:22:41] Elijah after he has seen a chariot
[2:22:46] coming he started
[2:22:49] walking
[2:22:53] Enoch seeing the Rapture
[2:22:56] coming he started
[2:22:59] working and the Bible
[2:23:01] says walked with
[2:23:04] God and he was not for God took him
[2:23:09] because he pleased
[2:23:12] God Amen in pleasing
[2:23:15] God you'll end up being taken
[2:23:19] away
[2:23:21] by God
[2:23:22] himself not by
[2:23:26] death
[2:23:29] for if you
[2:23:31] believe the Bible says you shall never
[2:23:38] see how many believe that
[2:23:42] scripture you shall never
[2:23:47] see all right amen because in you
[2:23:51] there's a white
[2:23:55] stone we are just thinking
[2:23:59] of home
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:02] going now Abraham
[2:24:06] Abraham he met
[2:24:09] MC he was introduced to the
[2:24:12] king of the
[2:24:15] city to come we are coming there we are
[2:24:19] laying that a
[2:24:22] foundation because the bride is like a
[2:24:27] city I was reading where the prophet of
[2:24:29] God
[2:24:31] says we are still coming the
[2:24:35] bride is like a
[2:24:39] pyramid that is the
[2:24:42] bride we are coming to the
[2:24:45] pyramid amen amen and Enoch en he believ
[2:24:51] God and then the
[2:24:53] sign that he was
[2:24:58] going was the structure the
[2:25:02] pyramid the people that are going
[2:25:06] now amen their names are in the Lamb's
[2:25:13] Book that's why your ministry now is the
[2:25:18] pyramid pyramid amen
[2:25:22] because it's a
[2:25:25] sign of those that are
[2:25:30] living you shall take that form
[2:25:34] first because it says the a child of God
[2:25:40] is like a
[2:25:43] pyramid in in this child of
[2:25:46] God there is a white
[2:25:49] stone
[2:25:50] which we
[2:25:55] call amen so it says now as I'm closing
[2:26:01] it
[2:26:02] says and verse
[2:26:06] 13 and the armies which were in heaven
[2:26:10] followed him upon white

[2:27:12] them if you are a child of
[2:27:15] God you are there's something in
[2:27:19] you

[2:38:12] amen the it is referring to the
[2:38:17] people dwelling with
[2:38:21] in
[2:38:23] heaven
[2:38:24] and the
[2:38:28] people Inhibitors of the Earth the
[2:38:35] sea
[2:38:39] now they dwell in
[2:38:43] heaven where are they
[2:38:48] from now when we read
[2:38:51] there now this very same
[2:38:57] army they
[2:38:59] died and they are in that
[2:39:04] position you know I can repeat for last
[2:39:08] minute that when the Lord
[2:39:11] died and the Bible says he rose again on
[2:39:18] the
[2:39:20] but when he
[2:39:25] resurrected the graves were
[2:39:30] open that is his power of the
[2:39:35] resurrection and the
[2:39:38] did came
[2:39:41] out you know you were told that when he
[2:39:46] left ascended
[2:39:48] up
[2:39:50] that
[2:39:51] cloud was The Souls of those that
[2:39:59] resurrected amen amen
[2:40:02] now these are called
[2:40:05] armies which were in
[2:40:08] heaven they were here on
[2:40:10] Earth and they were taken
[2:40:14] up you know it says when he rose again
[2:40:19] they rose
[2:40:22] again amen amen amen that's what the
[2:40:25] Bible says when we shall come we shall
[2:40:29] be like
[2:40:33] him you know right now you don't see our
[2:40:37] true
[2:40:38] colors but when he shall
[2:40:42] appear we shall be like
[2:40:47] him that's our True
[2:40:52] Colors hey what does that mean meaning
[2:40:58] that when he shall
[2:41:01] appear it says we shall see
[2:41:05] him as he
[2:41:08] is meaning that you know
[2:41:13] him because if you know him then you
[2:41:17] shall see him as he is
[2:41:20] [Applause]
[2:41:21] that would mean that even now you know
[2:41:27] him you can't worship a God you don't
[2:41:33] know all right
[2:41:36] am they followed
[2:41:39] you now you see that scripture
[2:41:42] says they were
[2:41:44] where of
[2:41:46] heaven but they were men like
[2:41:50] us they were
[2:41:53] on but after they were
[2:41:56] raptured the Bible says they were
[2:42:00] in
[2:42:03] heaven am that's it amen and
[2:42:08] then they they were
[2:42:10] nowy an
[2:42:14] army now I'm closing here we were to
[2:42:19] this
[2:42:20] morning about
[2:42:22] this that which armies are going to get
[2:42:27] engaged in the battle
[2:42:35] ofon you know some look this way some
[2:42:39] look that
[2:42:43] way we are going to follow
[2:42:47] it why
[2:42:50] the
[2:42:52] only
[2:42:55] body in
[2:42:57] you that can catch
[2:43:02] this these
[2:43:05] things you know we you can repeat it
[2:43:09] time and
[2:43:10] again but it will never
[2:43:14] find a
[2:43:16] place because there's no place for it in
[2:43:21] that particular
[2:43:25] person the Lord Jesus said to
[2:43:31] thees he
[2:43:33] said my way has no
[2:43:40] place meaning that you are a
[2:43:45] place either in
[2:43:48] you
[2:43:50] because if he says my
[2:43:53] word has got no
[2:43:56] place in you that's
[2:44:00] finish because if there's a
[2:44:03] place for his word his word is
[2:44:08] eternal and can only
[2:44:11] dwell in
[2:44:14] eternity amen amen
[2:44:16] amen and in eternal
[2:44:20] being cannot
[2:44:22] live in something that is
[2:44:26] not it can
[2:44:29] survive the word of God cannot survive
[2:44:33] in
[2:44:34] me I don't have an eternal f
[2:44:39] for because it is eternal it can only
[2:44:42] dwell
[2:44:45] in so that's why your
[2:44:48] body people of
[2:44:50] God God can come in
[2:44:54] you because in you there's a place for
[2:44:59] you
[2:45:01] amen there's a throne in
[2:45:04] you now when he comes to
[2:45:07] you God Don't force himself into he
[2:45:11] comes to his
[2:45:14] place he has prepared that place for
[2:45:17] himself
[2:45:20] now when he comes to you he comes to
[2:45:23] take his
[2:45:27] place that's
[2:45:31] why I stand at the
[2:45:35] door and
[2:45:38] knock now listen he says and
[2:45:43] if any
[2:45:46] man hear my voice
[2:45:50] I shall
[2:45:54] come
[2:45:57] am you you can
[2:46:01] open we are coming
[2:46:05] back I will check
[2:46:08] that that he should come in
[2:46:11] [Music]
[2:46:14] fully if you are you you believe God
[2:46:21] like people
[2:46:24] say also believe the word of
[2:46:29] God
[2:46:30] because he is the word of
[2:46:33] [Music]
[2:46:40] God now if you believe
[2:46:42] him you believe him because you have
[2:46:47] believed him already
[2:46:50] yes he has prepared a place in you
[2:46:55] before when he comes to you OCC he just
[2:47:02] comes to a place that he has
[2:47:05] already when he died for
[2:47:13] you he he didn't die for you thinking
[2:47:15] that maybe you'll become a righteous
[2:47:17] person uhuh now
[2:47:19] he died for you
[2:47:21] because he had prepared that place for
[2:47:27] you now he died at the cross so
[2:47:31] that you can take his form
[2:47:36] amen so that he can in you
[2:47:42] lastly I'm down here you remember that
[2:47:47] story
[2:47:49] that
[2:47:51] man for to build a bridge oh that
[2:47:55] scientist that
[2:47:58] yes you know I repeat this thing
[2:48:01] because it's a true
[2:48:04] story some came
[2:48:07] before and they couldn't take the
[2:48:11] job
[2:48:12] because uh it is at the at the
[2:48:17] sea
[2:48:19] water now they said the job is for one
[2:48:25] who can build a
[2:48:28] bridge across that
[2:48:33] stretch now all the other
[2:48:36] Architects they
[2:48:39] failed then Here Comes This
[2:48:43] one
[2:48:45] and he also he knew
[2:48:49] about the
[2:48:51] others the others came and
[2:48:56] failed then he knew the
[2:48:59] secret amen
[2:49:01] amen he started he said I will take the
[2:49:06] job and then you know if you come to a
[2:49:10] place where some other people have
[2:49:14] failed you get
[2:49:17] discouraged
[2:49:20] they we also failed there we were
[2:49:23] looking for work
[2:49:25] there mean how can you build a bridge it
[2:49:28] sent all over down
[2:49:30] [Music]
[2:49:32] there now it says I won't read Now read
[2:49:36] next but he says the man
[2:49:40] said I
[2:49:43] know and in his
[2:49:46] heart he had White
[2:49:52] Stone because he knew that there must be
[2:49:56] a
[2:49:59] rock down there because you can build on
[2:50:08] Sand before he even
[2:50:11] started he was
[2:50:13] encouraged by the fact that he knew that
[2:50:17] there's a rock
[2:50:23] there we are trying like
[2:50:27] this we
[2:50:29] believe because we know there is
[2:50:33] heaven we know that the world will come
[2:50:36] to the
[2:50:38] end we know that we will be
[2:50:42] raptured amen amen and so he knew
[2:50:47] that the word
[2:50:49] there's a
[2:50:52] rock am
[2:50:55] and he started to go down with his
[2:51:01] machines until he arrived at the
[2:51:07] rock some others they could couldn't
[2:51:10] reach that
[2:51:11] place if you are a
[2:51:14] Christian you
[2:51:16] need Amen to go
[2:51:20] Beyond you go
[2:51:23] beyond the
[2:51:26] place where the
[2:51:29] people have
[2:51:32] failed a Christian is a person he can
[2:51:36] meet he can meet you after you have
[2:51:42] failed you are coming this
[2:51:44] way then he's going that
[2:51:47] way amen
[2:51:52] amen amen
[2:51:56] Christian it's fine I know there must
[2:52:02] be amen amen the master can't say to me
[2:52:07] build a
[2:52:09] bridge unless there's a rock down
[2:52:13] there that's why the people some meet
[2:52:17] some
[2:52:19] coming
[2:52:20] from with others
[2:52:23] going for and to the same
[2:52:28] place right because this one knows that
[2:52:31] there must be a
[2:52:33] rock down there now he until he
[2:52:39] arrives at the that the
[2:52:44] Sun and he knew that many died here
[2:52:49] many have failed
[2:52:51] here then he started knowing that there
[2:52:55] must be a
[2:52:57] rock Beyond
[2:53:00] this how many times you come to a
[2:53:06] place when other people tells you I also
[2:53:09] tried and failed but somebody comes but
[2:53:12] another
[2:53:14] one just right where you face he starts
[2:53:18] right there
[2:53:20] amen he goes
[2:53:22] beyond that
[2:53:26] line and
[2:53:32] that a lot of people
[2:53:35] fed he
[2:53:37] knew there must be
[2:53:44] a so he started from there
[2:53:49] and until he arrived at
[2:53:52] the amen
