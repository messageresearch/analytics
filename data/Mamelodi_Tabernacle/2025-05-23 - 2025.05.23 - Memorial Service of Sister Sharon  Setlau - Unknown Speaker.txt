I think I don't think it's the purpose but the main purpose one of the good days ahead of us actually they know more than they they know better than us today. So they are more advanced than we than we are today. We are still poking here and there, but they already know and we appreciate and then to to bring us here and we appreciate everything, Lord. As we continue in this life, just know the steps that your mother took while on this. She was an example and just copy from there and let us continue in this journey. There will be test along my she used to call me my sister and I called her my Sheron. I knew until I left the side of Sheron is supportive and she's loving. She's a person who loves to share about the word. 2021. She really supports. I remember in 2021 when the father of my kids passed, she's the one who was on my side, gave me support through the love that she had. When I got the job that I'm doing now, when I went for training, when I told her that I'm leaving for training, she said, "My sister, don't worry." And indeed, she took care of my kids. There wasn't any worry. I came back. I told her that I'm done with my training. I'm coming back. She decided that I can't just come back without any event where we can celebrate. She threw a big party for me and that gave joy to all my brothers and sisters. before she can do that party, she asked me where can we do which venue can we use and I said to her the venue will be at home in the where I grew up I don't want to say much but I want to say Your mother didn't leave you without any parent. Your parent is here. It's me. Don't be afraid if you lack anything. Sister P of your mother is here. Continue living as we did. Thank you. [Applause] God bless you. Uh Dennis, we proceed to Balon speech by our siblings. Uh I will start by Fesa Mana and then followed by Tapelo. Amen. They will come following each other. Amen. Oh god. [Music] I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Um I'm here to speak about Cece. Um and I was just talking that now we have to comfort our husband. We were thinking that the way was to us she was welcoming like I know that every Sunday or almost every Sunday will come by my place and if she doesn't come I'll call her sis are you not coming. I had a a great moment and is a blessing to have a a sister like her. Uh sister Cheron was a mother to her kids and she also become a mother to us and to our kids and becoming a point whereby if uh one of my boys sick before I can even think of going to the clinic I'll call and she will give me instruction. For example, if one of my son broke has a blocked nose will tell me what to do and and everything that I will do it work out. It's hard to let her go. But I just want to thank God because every moment with Cersei, it was a blessing. She had a open heart for us. I have never had any day that she took me as a little sister. She never get tired of my text. my calls. Whenever I call, she's always there. But what comfort our heart is that he's going to meet again. And when we meet again, we won't part anymore. I have a lot to say about but I just want to thank God for every moment for always being around. Thank you. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I greet all the saints in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I would like to greet all the saints in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] I'm here today to celebrate a soldier uh who happened to be my sister who by God's grace became our mother as you all know last year in November on the 23rd we were burying our mom but After that our sister took over. She closed the gap with distinctions. Amen. Amen. So we never even came to a point where we said if our mother was here because she our sister she was playing that role very well as auntie was saying she was not a the mother to just her kids but to every one of us And you know she's so accommodative, so generous, so delightful that when you are around her, you don't want to leave. And I always ask myself, what is that I can do so that I could always be closer to her? Because one thing that I I had almost um I had almost had forgotten is how much I loved her, you know, because growing up because she was the first born and I was the second and then we grew up together as twins, but because of the activities of life, we end up having to to to be apart, you or she got married. I got married and we started our own things. But after the passing of our mom, by God's grace, that gap was open again that I get a little bit closer to her. That's when that love that I've known when we were still young, I could now feel it. Now I I will tell you that three four weeks before a passing I was visiting a house almost every day and I I would leave about 10 11 12 in the morning and I would say to my niece today I am not going to go to your house. I am not coming to your house. By 12:00, I will see myself leaving their house. I was saying the same thing every day. Little did I know I was beating her farewell and just to h because I I don't think tomorrow I'll have this opportunity just to give you a little bit of what happened before or what caused a departure. Of course, the main thing was that God missed her too much. He wanted him her more to on his side than we did. Our sister was not sick. She just had discomfort in her tummy. That was two weeks back. That was two week back on on Monday. And then on that Monday she did not go to work and she instead went to see the doctor and the doctor said you need to come back after two days so I could do I could put you through the scan. Indeed she returned back to the doctor and then she was put through the scan and then the doctor said I could pick up pick up um three if I'm not mistaken it was three gallstones. And then the doctor said, "No, it's something easy. They are not that serious. It's something as as easy as anything that you could think of." And then they set an appointment that come next week, Wednesday, so that we can we could remove them. It was on the 14th. That was last week, Wednesday. And then she she she on that the night before the 13th I was at a place and then I was even fighting with her. I say, "Hey, you know, it's almost 10. You're not supposed to be eating because tomorrow you're going for an operation." And then uh on on on Monday of that day of that week, she did send a the message to the pastor, notifying the pastor of uh the the activities. And then I left at I left her place at around about 11. And then she left in the morning around about 7 a.m. with her daughter, the eldest daughter. And then they went to the hospital. And then when they get to the hospital, they stayed together long, I think for about two hours up until she was called to the theater. Only when she was going to the theater, her daughter left. That's when her daughter waved her hand and the my sister responded by waving hand as well. That was their last communication and she went and then the doctor started the doctor started the procedure in trying to remove the girl stoles and then as they were busy they said my sister was got a what do you call a cardiac arrest and then they stopped the procedure and they resuscitated her. And then the the heart started working normally and then they stopped with the procedure completely the procure of removing the gallstones. They started to attend to to to to the to what caused the cardiac arrest and it was discovered that and it was discovered that there was a a a minor bleeding The doctor said to me, "It was so small that it couldn't have caused the cardiac arrest." Nonetheless, the doctor closed the bleeding and then she was then removed from uh the theater to the ICU. two three minutes in the ICU card arrest again but this time they could not resuscitate her and then that's when when I was home now I was I was at her place waiting for her because I knew she just went to to take out Gstone then she came back and then but the call that I got it was that she was not coming back. Well, I didn't know what to do. Should I cry? Should I faint? I just didn't know what to do. I just froze. And then they they had said to me, "You must come to the hospital." But I could not I didn't know how to start. Should I go? Should I not go? I just found myself meandering the same place over and over again. Amen. Amen. So that's how she she left us. But what comforted me because we had a lot of questions as to like why why because we did not see any signs. She was not sick. But then there's a scripture that came to life to me on that day because I sounded like I was questioning God too much. And then God said to me through the scripture, my thoughts are very far from your thoughts. I stopped questioning. I said, God, I still trust your will. So I'm saying to you, brethren, if you see us maybe crying, it is not because we are scared of death. We will miss our sister. They will miss their mother. They will miss their cousin. But I will tell you that glory to God, the one that we have received, he has promised that if you believe the way that I preach unto you, he shall not see death. So since then I told myself that my sister is not dead. My sister cannot die. She saved God with all her heart. She did not have money but she traveled all over the world with the pastor to an extent that people thought she had lot of money. I would I would I I used to ask her such a lot of money because I told people I tell people that I'm a businessman but not to her to her she would give me money for petrol sometimes she would come with a t-shirt that was my sister of all five of us because recently as we the preparations I just saw a pisley. I was like and but this person has had money. Then I remembered her way. I said, "Do people think I have money?" I said, "You do?" She said, "No." I said, "But where do you get all this money?" She said to quote her, "I also don't know. It's God who gives me." So my sister her generosity it's only that she did not have you know these millions that people has but should he had those millions I will tell you a world will be a better place you know now we can see that God is rewarding that generosity I'm going to tell something today it's it was supposed to be a secret But I am overwhelmed. You see the things that are happening here almost everything that we are doing today these preparations we are doing them almost out of nothing. If you ask me how I don't know now I know what you are saying I'm saying to you. You see these things, there's people who just come and offer because God is rewarding her generosity. But the greatest reward that she received, it was when she was crossing over. When she was crossing over, the last Sunday she attended service for some reasons. That day she was visible on the DVD. Everyone went talks to me. People from Cape Town, everywhere they say, "But we saw her on Sunday. It she was so visible. She was saying to us, "I am crossing over." On her way back, she was talking to her children. She asked them about three to four times. They will probablyify them tomorrow. Amen. She said to them, "Guys, did you hear preaching?" And then she would laugh, say, "And then she would drive for another maybe for a few kilometers, ask the same question again, preaching, she would drive few kilometers, ask the same question again." Then my my younger brother and I do miss when we revisit preaching said you must have a desire to change your body and I've seen that on my sister's face in the last weeks when my was was about to depart she became so sweet it was unlike her she was always smiling And I thank God through the sisters who chose these pictures because they resemble almost exactly how much was during this last day. She was so happy and then some see some people they saw on her statuses that she was beating farewell because the colleagues actually they came to her trying to reprimand her but no don't talk about death like that least did they know she was saying to them I'm leaving you so we are not shaken no power, no disease, no sickness, no death shall separate us from the love of God. Even if it means it be me tomorrow, I can guarantee you what our parents left us, what our pastor in invested in us, what the prophet brought to us. We are the living proof of that. We are not talking about the prophet that we that we know. The prophet that God has sent angel believe brother Angeli. They believe brotherham. We just don't believe that brother sent but we are the manifestation of that which the prophet has preached. We are the manifestation of that which our pastor is preaching. Hallelujah. Amen. [Applause] She's young where she is today. Amen. So, we're going to rise. We have come to the very important moment of the word of God. Amen. So, we're going to rise. I'm not going to sing. I wanted to sing a song just for one minute for for We can all rise. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] How so cool. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Figure I said Let me [Music] [Applause] figure it all.

[Music] I greet all the children of God this afternoon. Jesus Christ. Amen. I'm going to say I'm happy to be here because the Bible says precious in the sight of the Lord. Precious in the sight of is the death of his saints. When we have somebody who has passed away, then as children of God, we are not disappointed. We know. But while standing on our feet, my brother, let's read the book of Thessalonians, chapter 4. We read only verse 13. We are going to read the book of Romans, chapter 15 verse 4-5. 15 verse 4- 5 verse 13. Chapter 4 verse 13. Chapter 4:3 First. Yeah. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep. Amen. That ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. Amen. Right. Romans chapter 15 verse4 verse 4 and 5 for whatsoever thing for whatsoever things were written a four times were written for our learning that we thought that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. Amen. Let's close our eyes. Mighty heavenly father. This is another chance once more granted to me by yourself. Amen. to stand in front of your children here to present something from you and to them at this time. Amen. Of brief bereiement. Yes. Heavenly Father, thank thank you very much Lord. And I'm really asking thee to come and take over. Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may take your seats. When things like this happen, we as children of God, we come and adise one another. Paul says here, I would not you have be ignorant concerning them which are asleep that he sorrow not even as others which have no hope. When we are here, when we go to church, when we worship, we have got hope. Amen. Then when things like this happen, we must tell people about our hope. People must know why we are doing things like this. Amen. Because we have got hope. Amen. The Bible says those which have been written before have written for us so that we can have hope. Because of that I want to tell you about four groups of people. on living on earth having their different destination after death because living here on earth we know that you are going to die. But what we don't know is when are we going to die and how are we going to die because death has no reason and death has no method. You can't say I'm going to die through accident. or I'm going to be killed. I'm going to be sick before I die. Our destinations, our destinations and we cannot cross them. But let me talk about these four groups of people. who have the different destination after death. These groups are here. You you belong to one of these groups. Then I want to tell you a destination. The first group are those who names are written in the lamb's book of [Music] [Applause] life. Amen. That book is also called the book of redemption. That is the first group. Their names are written there. Another group, their names are written in the book of life. Their names are written there. And the third group, their names were written in the lambs in the book of life, but they were removed. They were written, but they were removed. Perhaps they are here. Perhaps I will tell you why their names were removed. The last group, the fourth one, their names are not written in the in these two books. But they have got their own records, but not in the record of life. That is the fourth group. The first group they are called in different names. They are called the bride. They are called the saints. They are called the redeemed. They are called the royal seed of Abraham. Jesus called them his brethren. [Music] That is the first group. The second group is called the foolish visions. They are called the righteous. And they are called God called them the blessed. That is the second group. The third and the fourth group they called the cast. Are you together with me? Amen. Amen. Just look where you are. This four different groups. The first one when they die, when we take this because this body, all of us, our bodies went to the grave. But you, you don't go to the grave. You are going to go to the grave. [Music] Whether you are the first group, the second group or the third [Music] group, when you die, your bodies go to the same place. But you are soul if you belong to the first group your soul goes to the sixth dimension dimension which is called the first heaven says I went there and he said Paul went to the third heaven He said he himself went to the fest and he said there I found the souls of the redeemed. Are you together? They this first group they qualify for the first resurrection. because you have got only two resurrections. This is this is the time for us to tell one another who we are and who you are. Amen. Yes, sir. We describe you. I describe you. Then you will see this is me because I'm I'm giving description. You will put yourself where you belong. When they die, they go to the sixth dimension dimension which is the first heaven. Bible says they are going to rest. They qualify for the first resurrection because we have got only two resurrection. We've got the first resurrection and the second resurrection and the first resurrection. Those who qualify for that resurrection is the only is this first group only. The last three, they qualify for the second resurrection. [Music] Just read Revelation 20:6 to show that we have got two resurrection. verse 6. Blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection. On such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ. Amen. And shall reign with him a thousand years. When we talk about the first resurrection, this first group When living here on earth, they have already resurrected spiritually. Amen. If you are not resurrected, you will never be part of the first resurrection because by birth you die being dead. Sorry. You you you are you you are born being dead. The Bible says we are born in sin shaped in iniquity and came to the world speaking life. All of us whether you are the child of the saint but because of birth you are born a sinner. If you are a sinner you are born dead and you are born controlled from hell. Amen. And the Bible says, if you hear, if you hear, Jesus says, if you hear my word and believe on him who sent me, you move from death. Then you are transferred to life. In other words, when you hear the his word, you resurrect because you are dead. by birth. But when you hear his word, you resurrect. That's why the Bible says leave the dead to bury their dead. They must bury one another. Don't disturb them. Why do you interfere with them? Amen. But those who are resurrected, they must take the dead bodies to the grave because the owner of the body is not dead. Amen. He he had resurrected. Then those who have been resurrected already now they will qualify for the first resurrection. This one, this this resurrection is a a a supernatural resurrection. is not a physical one, but another one. It's going to be a physical one because they will move from the sixth dimension and come down here. take bodies which is called the the the glorified bodies and they those who are still living because they they are already resurrected themselves they will get out of these bodies. They will change these bodies. his bodies will just vanish and they will take another body which is the [Music] glorified and and be raptured and meet Jesus in the sky. Are you together with me? I'm talking about the first group. Because when you die, you go to your own. No one is not going to his own. When you die, you go through your own. Hallelujah. If you are born again, you go to those who are born again. Amen. Because they they belong to the first group. They are the real the real seed of Abraham. If you are the royal seed of Abraham here now, when you die, you go to the royal seed of Abraham. And if you are not the royal seed of Abraham, if you are not born again, why do we born again? Because we are born in sin. Our first birth is death. Then we must get out of that and be born again. And we know to be born again it must come by a seat and the seat travels through the body from the boot to another body. The seat is the word of God. The Bible says you are born by the the seed which is not corrupted. Which is the word of God. Then the word of God moves through the body to the body. Then if you have not receive all let me stop there. I shall come back. I was saying when you die you go to your own read Psalm 49 there 49 I think you will read verse 16 verse 16 yeah Psalm 49 verse 16 I think so Psalm 49 verse 16 Yeah. Verse 16 to 19. Just read it. 19 16 19. Psalms 49 16. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased. For when he shall carry nothing away, his glory shall not desend after him. Though while he lived, he bless his soul, and men will praise thee. When thou does well to thyself, he shall go to the generation of his fathers. They shall never see light. Amen. You see where his fathers are. They are in darkness and darkness is in hell. In other words, his fathers, they are in hell. And when this man die, he must go to his father. That's why I say you go to your own. Amen. You you are born in darkness even though you say you are in light because light is the word of God. But when you are outside of the word of God by birth all of us we are born in darkness. We are born controlled there. Amen. Guess why? When a child is still small, but when when a child is born, the mother say he he's angry bite this mother's priest. He say he is he is angry. When he steal a little baby start to steal when you come he put his sense back. Why is born in sin? He's a thief. He's born being a thief. He's been being a liar. He had to be born again. When he's when he's there, when he is there, he is in darkness. When when he died, he just went where he is. Because living here on earth, we are controlled from different places. And you are control from where you are. When you hear the word, you move from a place to a place. When you hear the word of God, you have a a connection with the place where you are because you when you are born again, you go to where God is. Then when you die, you go to where you are. Because when you are not, you are here and not born again. You are controlled from below from the fifth dimension. That's why you you are connected with the wishes. When the that's why let me tell you man is a tune being his body soul spirit when you die all these things separate The body went to the grave. Grave. If you are the child of God, your spirit went to God. Your soul went to the sixth dimension. Tell me, if you're not a child of God, your body went to the grave. Where is your spirit? Amen. Your soul will go to hell. Your spirit will just move all around you. If you are you died in the hospital, your spirit will be there in the hospital. Your spirit Wow. All right. The prophet told the prophet told me like that. He said the man was hit by the car and died there. Another man came hid the same man because the spirit of that man is there. The wishes will use the spirit to bewish you. Then you see your father because they've taken the spirit of your father. They even can take the soul of your father. But because your the soul of your father is tormented there, they use the spirit of your father. Are you together with let me go where I'm going. The second group I said they are the foolish [Music] visions. They are called the blessed. They have got they qualify for the second resurrection. In the second resurrection, they called the blessed because Jesus said, the Bible says there in Matthew chapter 25, he said, "Come ye blessed of my father." He was tooken to the foolish vision, the Russians, the second group who are written in the book of life. He said, "Come ye blessed of my father, but it is during the second resurrection." He said because I was in hospital and you came and see me hungry you fed me. They said who we didn't see you there. He said when you were doing that to the list of these brethren, who are those brethren? They are the first group. Are you together? when you that's why you must not hate because he he said to the the the other group he said come we cast because I was in hospitalally you didn't come and see me they are thrown into the lake of because of their hatred. If you hate one of the brethren or one of the royal seed of Abraham, you send yourself to hell. Even if you say I am the bread, You will just be talking you have you have reason yourself to have God is love. There is no hatred in God. If you don't love me as your brother love me as your your enemy because the Bible says love your enemy. There is no hatred in God there. You don't have reason to hate somebody. If you hate, you are the cast. You are not giving a foolish vision. I swear, you are the cast. Even if you can sing the whole night, even if you can fast and go to the mountain and come back and speak in tongues, but you are the cast. That is the third the second group. The second group are the blessed because they loved the brethren. For them to qualify is only because they loved the brethren only not because they fasted. Not because they they they were not they were not prostitute. Not because they were not drunkard. There is no such because you love your brethren. Come here the blessed father. Some were there with good works. They were waiting. If they call that one when it comes my time you'll see he said you I don't know you said but hey I I I I am that great preacher I don't know you the one who was was healing the people there raising the dead in the name in your him. I don't know you. You hated the brethren. [Music] You You have done that by hating the brethren with great works, fasting, praying, doing miracles, singing, preaching, mighty preachers, I don't know you. This is the fourth, the third and the fourth group. They also qualify for the second resurrection. The second the second group, the third group and the the fourth group. They all qualify for the second result because there is only one group which qualify for the first. is the bride. Amen. They are the ones who are written in the lamp. They are the ones who belong to the lamb. They are the redeemed. Amen. When the lamb died on the cross, It was it was been killed for them. He shed this blood for them because because of birth they came this way. Then he came to buy them back. Praise God. To come back to go to where they were from the beginning. They came here because of birth. It was not their place. Because that's the reason when they hear the word, he was speaking with them. That's why it is written in the Bible. So that when I come, I must read there. Oh, Jesus said to me, I'm going to prepare you the place. Amen. Praise God. And he is telling you also. I'm going to prepare you a place. And if you want, that place can be yours. If you want that place, you just receive his way. How can they receive my ways? If there is no preacher, how can he preach? If he's not sent, every now and then, every dispensation, every age, every generation, God has his man. Amen. so that that man can talk with the people. God has to come in flesh. So because his children are in flesh so that he can talk to in flesh when he's in flesh when they are in flesh they can talk together. He he he he called your brother. He called your brother so that he can send your brother to you. He don't come in as an angel. He don't come as a spirit. He don't just send a voice, but he send your brother to you to talk to you. And if you listen to your brother, you listen to him. He said to them, if they don't hear you, then they will never hear me. Amen. Do you remember that man? He said to Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, I still have my brothers there. Can you go there and tell them so that they may not come to where I am? He said, Moses and the prophets are there. If they don't hear them, even if I can send an angel from here, was never here. May you together with us here. This second group, their destination is the new Jerusalem. because they are part of the first group. But by predestination, they were just taken out. That's why they call them the visions. They they they they come out there being vig all of them but their problem these other visions they have oil others have oil but they are the the same group. Are you together? They they don't have a rapturing faith. They have got faith but not the rapturing faith. Amen. The rapturing seven thunders will give the bride a rapturing faith. The revelation of those seven thunders is the one that will give the plan. Amen. Amen. They are there. After after after everything has been done, there was only one thing, a white [Music] stone in that pyramid which was not interpreted. But it had to be interpreted because it is there. It is part of the whole thing. Everything has been interpreted. Only this one. [Music] The interpretation of that word will give the bride that is that is the only difference there. Amen. Because when we get to that one now he said now stay here. Look inside. Amen. I must go west. When he come back from west, he said now I come with the interpretation. Where is that interpretation? It was not with him. It was in him. Amen. All right. Let me let me not go there. I want to show you the difference of these vict brothers they are just like one cloth. The owner the owner went to the shop and he choose among the cross there type of a cloth. If it is it was red all of it. He took that cloth and he put it on the on the on the table there, the same cloth. He he has chosen it because he loved that cloth. But there comes the the pen. Now the Caesar the Caesar moves through the pen. It is the the the nation which moved the then out he took out the pattern the same the the the whole cloth remain on the table there then he took the the pattern and he used the pattern for what he wanted. After using the pattern now he went back to that table because that cloth he liked he has chosen it then he he take the the remaining one make something out of it after the burden it's the same predestination separated that's why their destination is the is the new Jerusalem. But these ones they are outside the city. The first group inside this group is outside. They are tillers of the soil. outside. The second, the the the third and the fourth, their destination is the league of [Music] fire. The third and the fourth, those who were written and removed. Those who were removed, they were removed be because they hated the brethren. If you hate the brethren, Judas was removed because he hated Jesus. Firstly, they was told Don't rejoice because he was I I think he was the one who was making a noise there. I I I prayed for the sick. I've driven the [Music] demons. Don't be don't don't be don't rejoice over that. Rejoice because your names written in heaven. Judas was there. His name was there but it was removed because of hatred praying with the pastor, hating the pastor and sold the pastor. If I'm people talking about the pastor there. Yeah, I know that pastor. It's just like that. Do you want to do you want him? I I can give me 30 cent. 30 cent. He said, "Yes, we'll give you 30 cent." Okay. Thank you. the destination. Read read revelation chapter 20 and see from verse 11. Destination of this this third and fourth Revelation 20:1 And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. This is the second death. Why second death? Where is the first one? You are born dead. This is the second. Because you upon death, you are [Music] dead. Because God is life. When you accept God, you accept the life. In the beginning was the way. The word was with God. And the word was God. And the word was made flesh. And those who receive him, they were given power to become the children of God. Books were opened. These are books of sinners. The death were judged. They were they are standing there. dead. Those who are going to be judged are the dead. You cannot judge the living. You judge the dead. When we say some someone is dead is because he doesn't have the word of God in him, doesn't have life in him. and life is God. He said now books were open. You see if you are a wish you come there with your because they are your books. If you are a mother, you come with all people you murdered. You are going to murder them at the judgment. Then study the first one. Second killing made the judgment because it it is something like it is it is. Yeah. It is bring something which has been has been done there back here so that you can see what you have done from when you are still a boy when stealing a sugar coming up there. When you become older, when you start to do what you do, you come come up until you die. That is your book. The books will be open. But these books are for the the fourth and the third. Not the first and the second. They are not here. Here they are the fourth group and the third group. They are standing here with their works. Even those who were praying for the sick coming, they will do that. There's judgment there. And the first group will be there looking at them. Yeah, they are being it. Because they are judges. Amen. I'm standing here today as a judge. If you don't know, I'm telling you these words are going to judge you. One of the good days. That is where we that is what we are. That is our hope. Those who don't believe, they believe when they die, they are going to have power. They're going to be like him. They going to be gods, ancestors and men. But how how are how long are they going to be ancestors? Why do they get power when they are dead? But the Bible says even the old people who didn't worship God They would tell us they were used to tell us they said God will see you. They knew that if you don't do well, God doesn't love you. They will say if you're a ghost, they say God has has has chased you away. They say they know they knew that they will not be ancestors forever. They knew that there will come a time where they will be they have to be judged. The only thing which which has got the truth. Amen. Is the word of God. You live here. You die being living. That's why we say you are asleep. Blessed are the dead who die in Christ. You die in Christ because in Christ you get there because you are part of him. If you are not part of him, you'll never be there. Amen. You become part because you can hear the way and you can distinguish because among many ways. The the ichless could choose among many voices the voice of his mother. The child of God can choose among many ways the word of God. God bless you. Amen. Praise God. The only thing which can comfort us is life and life is God. If we live here with life, we are comforted. You cannot comfort somebody by a lie because when time goes on, he will realize that that man was telling me a lie. Then he will feel bad. But if you tell somebody the truth, the truth will remain the truth. One day he will realize that that man was telling me the truth and the truth is the word of God. The word of God will console you. Amen. God is the only man who can console. No man, no social worker. No, no, no man. God only. He's the consoler. And if we want him to console us, we just go next to him and he will accept us. God bless you. Let's close our eyes. [Applause] Thank you, pastors. Let's close our eyes and pray. Mighty heavenly father. You loved us so much that you left your position as the great almighty God and came down and took the form of his son. Amen. So that you can come and die for sons. sons which were you which were with you before the foundation of the world. You love the world. The Bible says so. Love the world so much so that each and everyone who is living on earth can be saved by hearing your word. Amen. Bless the people who are here. Take the word which was spoken here. Amen. put it in each and everyone's heart. Amen. So that when we leave here, we can go and meditate upon what we have had. Amen. Bless the family. Yes. Console them. Amen. You are the only consoler.
