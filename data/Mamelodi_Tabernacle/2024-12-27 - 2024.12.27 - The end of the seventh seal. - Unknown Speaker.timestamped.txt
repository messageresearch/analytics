[2:42:32] listening when some
[2:42:36] people they were
[2:42:39] trying to talk about his
[2:42:43] coming but yet so discouraged
[2:42:50] the same people who were talking about
[2:42:54] him they were
[2:42:59] discouraged by the fact that inside of
[2:43:03] this
[2:43:04] people there is
[2:43:07] no
[2:43:09] coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:43:13] Christ but the Bible says the spirit and
[2:43:18] the right say
[2:43:25] come why because only part of
[2:43:30] him can
[2:43:34] say Lord

[2:53:34] for amen amen
[2:53:37] but they are there from
[2:53:42] eternity so you can't pray for
[2:53:45] them you are part
[2:53:48] of these things that we are going to
[2:53:52] code
[2:53:54] here is that
[2:53:58] right you know what
[2:54:00] brought us together
[2:54:04] here it
[2:54:06] happened way
[2:54:10] back do you know
[2:54:12] that it's not our first time to meet
[2:54:15] here
[2:54:18] we have met
[2:54:22] before all right amen but God decided to
[2:54:28] put us in this
[2:54:30] bodies this is not our
[2:54:34] bodies we have our
[2:54:37] bodies but
[2:54:39] God for us to dwell
[2:54:43] here for a
[2:54:45] while he has put us in this
[2:54:52] do you know that that body is not your
[2:54:59] body you are
[2:55:02] going to your

[2:55:13] flesh but your
[2:55:15] body you know where is your body
[2:55:21] all
[2:55:25] right I quote a
[2:55:32] bit what what puts me in this thing is
[2:55:37] that it is the end of the seven SE
[2:55:41] itself
[2:55:50] then the end of the seven o o of the
[2:55:54] seven

[2:56:11] in is the end of that thing
[2:56:19] you are getting
[2:56:23] engaged in
[2:56:27] something that is that has come to the
[2:56:36] end my
[2:56:39] body is the end of my
[2:56:43] body because the heart in your body
[2:56:50] cannot
[2:56:53] have the
[2:56:58] senses like the senses of the bride of
[2:57:06] Christ the bride of
[2:57:09] Christ has the sense of of Christ

[2:58:23] you amen amen amen you know
[2:58:28] him and what makes
[2:58:31] you to look for
[2:58:33] him every
[2:58:36] day thinking of

[3:12:35] happened the angel who was that
[3:12:40] angel amen amen
[3:12:44] amen he spoke to Mary
[3:12:48] then my Prophet
[3:12:52] says the words that Gabriel spoke to
[3:12:59] Mary they became
[3:13:04] blood in
[3:13:08] Mary amen amen
[3:13:11] amen the ministry the message that was
[3:13:14] preached to us
[3:13:19] he didn't just be he didn't just be an A
[3:13:24] A what you call now a
[3:13:29] gospel it became blood in
[3:13:35] us this blood is the word of
[3:13:41] God but when he spoke it became blood in
[3:13:45] US
[3:13:49] that's why it says you are
[3:13:53] born of the
[3:13:56] blood of
[3:13:58] Christ I'm trying to
[3:14:01] say
[3:14:03] uh to tell the
[3:14:06] nature to tell you about the
[3:14:09] nature of God in
