[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] [Music]
[0:23] [Music]
[0:27] we we thank the Lord
[0:30] this
[0:33] evening since we
[0:39] arrived is being a a blessing after
[0:46] blessing and uh first time I met our
[0:52] pastor
[0:54] uh my
[0:56] [Music]
[0:58] pastor
[1:02] I met him once in South Africa but just
[1:05] briefly I think he was SE next to the
[1:08] door I couldn't even see him
[1:12] properly but then when we met in K last
[1:18] time then he invited
[1:22] me and so we arrange for uh our visit
[1:28] here
[1:31] bow our heads in
[1:33] prayer Heavenly Father we are so
[1:38] grateful that we have a father like you
[1:40] an eternal
[1:44] father and it was good in your eyes
[1:47] before the foundation of the world to
[1:49] make a
[1:53] choice and the as the word says we were
[1:56] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:58] world
[2:02] this evening we are in this little spot
[2:04] of the
[2:09] Earth but we believe that greater is
[2:12] that is in
[2:15] us as we are turning to your
[2:18] word we are expecting some blessings
[2:21] upon
[2:24] us bless the CH the pastor of the
[2:28] church
[2:30] bless our pastors that are seated
[2:33] [Music]
[2:35] around bless the brothers and
[2:38] sisters as we start to hear from
[2:44] you the word of eternal
[2:47] life may you undertake for
[2:52] us weake of this bread of life
[2:58] tonight
[3:00] in Jesus Christ
[3:02] name amen amen let's turn to First John
[3:06] chapter
[3:28] 1
[3:38] you may be seated God bless
[3:46] you I will try to go slow the Lord
[3:53] will unless God decides to go
[3:58] faster
[4:01] so the prophet speaks
[4:04] of the
[4:08] intelligence time intelligence time
[4:18] intelligence time
[4:23] yes we we will read it as we
[4:28] continue
[4:32] let's pick up uh
[4:36] subject let's pick up a
[4:40] subject as the prophet preach about I
[4:43] have heard and now I
[4:50] see amen amen so we believe that this is
[4:55] the
[4:57] same time or the
[5:07] intelligence we have
[5:11] heard we have
[5:13] [Music]
[5:15] seen now we need the
[5:22] intelligence uh to be
[5:25] able to
[5:28] understand the things that we have
[5:34] seen hearing seeing and
[5:43] [Music]
[5:45] intelligence you can hear about the
[5:49] thing and yet you still don't know
[5:53] it is
[5:57] hearing then you come to see
[6:01] and still you don't
[6:04] understand you only see
[6:07] it then you need
[6:14] intelligence so it's a
[6:18] threefold
[6:20] see
[6:23] hearing
[6:25] intelligence which is the
[6:28] third the
[6:31] third amen now I read in the book
[6:37] here of the
[6:39] Prophet The Book of the
[6:42] Prophet now if we read reading the
[6:47] Bible we have seven Church
[6:52] ages now seven Church ages speak of time
[6:57] of the churches
[7:03] and the Bible says a blessed is he that
[7:09] an
[7:15] ear that is throughout the church
[7:20] ages that means it's an era of
[7:28] hearing amen amen so he that has an ear
[7:33] let him hear what the spirit says unto
[7:36] the
[7:39] churches that's in every Church
[7:43] age but after the
[7:47] churches it's no more
[7:53] hear we come to a
[7:58] seeing and
[8:02] intelligence now I think the revealed
[8:08] sevenes is the
[8:12] intelligence because the Seven
[8:15] Seals is
[8:19] Christ and brother
[8:22] says he is the seals that were
[8:28] revealed
[8:30] now that is the
[8:34] intelligence as we look into the books
[8:41] here God bless
[8:45] you now the prophet speaks
[8:50] here uh Christ is revealed in his own
[8:54] word is the spoken
[8:58] word
[8:59] then he
[9:02] says
[9:04] uh see now the vision he speak of the
[9:10] vision coming down to he says coming
[9:15] down to
[9:19] intelligence he says then it started
[9:21] right
[9:23] back the church come from the
[9:28] feet
[9:30] coming
[9:32] up now it's in the head
[9:38] time amen and now not the feet
[9:44] now but beyond the
[9:54] body and in the book of Christ is the
[9:56] mystery of
[9:58] God
[10:01] he calls it the original headship of
[10:08] [Music]
[10:11] Christ over
[10:14] the
[10:16] amen now the mind that is now in the
[10:20] bride is the intelligence
[10:25] [Music]
[10:27] Christ for he say the bride knows what
[10:30] to do with the
[10:34] word and he says the bride has the
[10:40] Lord so they have the
[10:44] intelligence not just
[10:47] hearing
[10:49] see but the
[10:53] intelligence amen that's why we are not
[10:58] confused
[11:00] we know who we
[11:02] are we know where we come
[11:05] from we know where we are
[11:09] going
[11:10] amen so now the prophet
[11:14] speaks then it started down coming
[11:20] up now he says you can't see with your
[11:25] hands yes it's part of the body
[11:30] you can't see with the
[11:33] ears yet it can
[11:36] hear you can hear but you can't see with
[11:38] your
[11:41] ears you can't see with the
[11:45] nose you can't see with the
[11:49] lips yet it
[11:52] speaks that was the Pentecostal
[11:57] age
[12:00] but now it's in the eye
[12:06] time you saw
[12:09] you seeing and intelligence are closed
[12:16] together because if you are looking at
[12:18] the
[12:20] thing you need intelligence to tell you
[12:23] what is that thing
[12:25] [Music]
[12:27] you
[12:30] now without the intelligence you'll be
[12:35] looking but yet not making out what it
[12:42] is then he says now this is the eye time
[12:47] the
[12:50] seeing and there isn't one moving
[12:53] faculty beyond the
[12:56] [Music]
[12:57] eye
[13:00] so beyond the eye there is nothing
[13:10] moving it's
[13:15] intelligence nothing moving
[13:19] there they
[13:23] hearing and the
[13:26] seeing have
[13:29] brought um the whole matter to the
[13:37] [Music]
[13:39] mind now brother
[13:41] says
[13:44] mind that was in
[13:46] Christ as the Bible
[13:49] says let the mind that was in Christ be
[13:52] in
[13:56] you and brother says
[13:59] that mind that was in
[14:02] Christ is your
[14:06] [Music]
[14:07] [Applause]
[14:10] soul
[14:12] because first thing first thing he
[14:17] says if you are
[14:21] looking you must be standing on the
[14:24] right
[14:27] place
[14:30] there are things you can't see unless
[14:32] you come to a certain
[14:39] place and the Bible
[14:42] say there was one day I can reading the
[14:45] Bible
[14:46] here you know you know you've got to
[14:48] choose the right
[14:53] place one time he took uh James John and
[14:57] Peter
[15:00] he took them up to the
[15:04] mountain because he was going to show
[15:07] them the
[15:11] supernatural now for them to see the
[15:16] supernatural supposed to come
[15:19] [Music]
[15:21] up
[15:23] am and in the Book of
[15:25] [Music]
[15:26] Revelation he said to Job
[15:30] come
[15:32] up and I will show
[15:35] you
[15:36] things after
[15:41] the
[15:43] brother he called
[15:46] John joh says Revelation
[15:51] 4 after these
[15:54] things I he a door was open
[16:00] so you see uh this place was sealed
[16:07] up between the church ages and the seals
[16:11] there was a
[16:16] door and that that that that's why in
[16:19] The
[16:21] Vision brother B came and Cho off the
[16:25] top of the
[16:27] pyramid
[16:30] to reveal what is
[16:36] within amen so it was not just a
[16:43] pyramid but it was sealed
[16:47] up amen you see
[16:52] Enoch he was the
[16:54] one who build that structure the pyramid
[17:00] because he was the seventh
[17:04] man and the pyramid has seven
[17:09] steps so the seventh
[17:12] man from
[17:14] Adam bu the
[17:19] pyramid and no one
[17:22] could
[17:25] interpret what is there in the pyramid
[17:29] until there was the seventh
[17:35] [Applause]
[17:36] messenger so you see the seventh
[17:45] one but the seventh
[17:48] messenger he
[17:52] interpreted hallelujah
[17:54] amen so while we are looking at these
[17:57] things
[18:00] I'm going back to the Book of
[18:04] Genesis uh you you first find the right
[18:10] place to
[18:12] see amen and the Book of
[18:19] Genesis I will turn to uh chapter
[18:25] 13 oh let's start by reading uh
[18:31] chapter
[18:35] 19 chapter 19 verse
[18:39] 27
[18:41] ver and Abraham got up early in the
[18:45] morning to the place where he stood
[18:47] before the
[18:50] [Music]
[18:54] Lord there was a reason why he went to
[18:58] that
[19:02] place because there he stood before the
[19:08] Lord so he went back to the same
[19:14] place the reason he he he came
[19:18] here the Bible says verse
[19:23] 28 and he looked towards
[19:27] Sodom
[19:30] and and toward all the land of
[19:34] the and beh low the smoke of the country
[19:38] went up as the smoke of a
[19:44] f Abraham
[19:47] knew that for him to see Sodom
[19:53] bending he must come to a certain
[19:57] place
[19:59] and that certain
[20:01] place it's where he
[20:04] stood before the
[20:08] Lord and from that
[20:11] position he could see
[20:17] Sodom
[20:18] right as we we are standing before the
[20:22] Lord in the end
[20:24] time after the
[20:27] Rapture we will
[20:30] see the
[20:33] world I believe
[20:36] that okay okay now he chose that
[20:42] position and uh while we are in this
[20:48] scripture chapter 13
[20:51] says chapter
[20:53] 13 verse 14 ver 14
[21:00] and the Lord said unto
[21:03] Abraham after Lord was separated from
[21:08] him you know go before God gave him the
[21:15] land he showed him the
[21:21] land because brother
[21:24] says you need to have eyes first
[21:28] [Music]
[21:32] we will read it in the books
[21:35] here so so Abraham
[21:40] ABR stood there from that
[21:44] place and the Lord
[21:47] said for all the land which you
[21:52] see that means you are going to inherit
[21:59] the land which you
[22:06] see I must see the seals before I can
[22:10] inherit the
[22:16] seals amen now I will turn to the book
[22:22] here Look Away to
[22:25] [Music]
[22:26] Jesus the prophet speaks
[22:32] here page
[22:39] 23 he
[22:42] says the thing I want to ask you
[22:48] tonight is when you
[22:53] look what do you
[22:56] see
[22:59] amen when you
[23:02] look what do you
[23:06] see because you are going to inherit
[23:11] that which you
[23:16] see like if you see six seals you will
[23:19] inherit
[23:22] six you see
[23:26] seven but he
[23:29] says what do you see when you
[23:35] look
[23:37] amen that is Look Away to
[23:43] Jesus what do you see when you
[23:48] look that only depends on what you are
[23:51] looking
[23:55] for amen am
[23:58] not just
[23:59] looking but what you are looking
[24:06] for now what will
[24:10] determine what you are looking
[24:14] for is your
[24:19] position
[24:21] amen if if it's a prophet you will
[24:24] always look for the way to
[24:26] come
[24:29] it
[24:30] depends and again the prophet says
[24:35] here it depends on what you are looking
[24:42] at
[24:44] amen what do you
[24:47] see he says John the
[24:51] Baptist looked
[24:56] away amen
[24:58] now we are going to go to the scriptures
[25:00] that we have
[25:03] read brother say there was Jesus
[25:07] standing
[25:08] there and
[25:11] John couldn't recognize
[25:16] him he was standing right
[25:18] there and John says I didn't I couldn't
[25:23] recognize
[25:26] him now
[25:29] says until there was a
[25:37] sign now looking at John at Jesus
[25:41] looking at
[25:43] Jesus he was looking at
[25:49] a now he look so
[25:54] ordinary John could not recognize him
[26:00] as the L of
[26:02] God you see and then he looked
[26:09] away then he saw
[26:12] him when he looked
[26:15] away then he saw the Spirit coming like
[26:18] a
[26:21] d but that's when he looked
[26:24] [Applause]
[26:26] away
[26:28] amen amen
[26:30] amen because looking
[26:35] away he would be he would be looking
[26:38] from
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] somewhere you know if you read
[26:46] page the Faith Works is Faith
[26:53] Express brother
[26:55] say you you are
[26:58] a Triune person
[27:03] aun Body Spirit
[27:06] Soul now he
[27:09] says the
[27:11] soul is where you
[27:16] live that is
[27:18] the that is where you
[27:23] live now for John to to to look away
[27:30] it has to be from one
[27:33] place that is the
[27:38] soul let's
[27:40] repeat with his
[27:44] eyes not
[27:48] recognize with his
[27:51] eyes so he had to look
[27:56] away to pick him up from the superatural
[28:05] point by reading about the seals I don't
[28:08] see
[28:10] anything it's
[28:14] reading reading don't reveal to
[28:19] you you just end up
[28:23] reading the
[28:26] Jews is
[28:28] they read about the coming of the
[28:31] [Music]
[28:32] Messiah then it was when they were
[28:37] reading then he
[28:40] came they continue reading when he
[28:46] [Applause]
[28:50] was it's not just
[28:54] reading and the Maj the three wise
[29:01] men they came from the
[29:04] East
[29:06] and as they
[29:10] followed
[29:12] St
[29:14] their inward
[29:17] bodies their
[29:20] theop were in
[29:25] Orit with the star
[29:29] so as the Stars went this
[29:33] way
[29:38] went so now these three
[29:41] men they were
[29:44] [Music]
[29:47] L now when they reach
[29:51] Jerusalem they went into the
[29:55] synagogue and in the synagogue
[29:58] they found them
[30:02] [Music]
[30:05] reading that he shall be born in
[30:11] Bethlehem and the ma
[30:15] said where is
[30:18] he that is born King of the
[30:23] Jews
[30:25] amen now
[30:28] in the
[30:29] synagogue they produced the
[30:33] scroll and started
[30:35] [Music]
[30:39] reading and the ma
[30:42] said because they knew it was now not
[30:45] the reading
[30:51] [Applause]
[30:55] time is
[30:58] they read about
[31:01] it they heard about
[31:04] it now they are
[31:06] saying
[31:08] where where is
[31:11] he am they didn't ask for the
[31:16] reading they didn't ask for the
[31:19] reading they
[31:22] didn't they for
[31:26] him
[31:28] you know if you read in the
[31:30] Bible we we look at
[31:33] Philip how Philip said to
[31:38] Nathaniel come and
[31:41] see he never said come and
[31:45] [Music]
[31:48] read amen come and see
[31:52] what the one we have read
[31:56] about
[31:57] the one Moses wrote
[32:01] about the one the prophet
[32:06] prophesied but now this time it's not a
[32:11] prophecy it's not
[32:16] [Music]
[32:20] reading
[32:22] so that's the
[32:24] difference now he says Nathaniel
[32:28] he never said come and
[32:33] read the prophecy is now
[32:37] fulfilled the scure is now a
[32:41] [Applause]
[32:46] man it was reading not reading
[32:50] time seeing
[32:53] time because it was not a
[32:56] manifestation
[32:59] we
[33:00] have now we
[33:04] see then they said come and
[33:08] see
[33:10] amen and
[33:14] now the mes three wise
[33:18] men in the
[33:20] temple they received a
[33:24] scripture but their mission was
[33:30] they have come not to read but to
[33:35] see that was the
[33:37] difference so after a minister has
[33:42] read after a minister in
[33:47] the has read the
[33:50] scripture the saw that St
[33:55] again
[33:59] amen for they
[34:01] said we have seen
[34:08] his and the Pharisees have read his
[34:14] scripture now it was from scure
[34:19] [Applause]
[34:20] to that's why we have Seven
[34:25] Stars
[34:27] from a scripture to a
[34:31] star now you must find the star of the
[34:39] scriptures and follow the star of the
[34:41] script of your
[34:45] scriptures so the scriptures produce the
[34:49] St
[34:53] the now they just followed
[34:59] amen
[35:01] until when they went out of the
[35:07] denomination they saw the St
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] again when they
[35:17] separated because you must separate
[35:20] first then they saw the
[35:23] star and they
[35:25] rejo and follow the
[35:29] star amen and the
[35:32] star LED them to where he
[35:41] is and
[35:43] John says I did not know
[35:50] him like the M when he looked
[35:55] away he saw a spirit coming like a
[36:00] dve amen and the spirit pointed him
[36:06] out and John said this is my
[36:12] record this is my
[36:16] record this is the Lamb of
[36:21] God
[36:22] Amen and brother
[36:25] says one time
[36:29] Abraham he looked
[36:33] away then he saw the three balls of
[36:38] light he saw the three HS of
[36:43] [Applause]
[36:45] light when he
[36:53] looked when John looked down he saw a
[36:56] man Jesus
[37:04] he he
[37:07] saw
[37:09] the
[37:11] coming then he was watching the
[37:15] [Music]
[37:18] superal
[37:20] until it reached the Lord Jesus
[37:25] Christ when he
[37:29] recognized and said this is the L of
[37:36] God and he said now I bear record this
[37:39] is my
[37:41] record I have seen the
[37:45] supernatural
[37:47] now a child of God is a twofold
[37:52] [Music]
[37:54] being the Lord Jesus was double he was
[38:00] twofold one Jesus is the
[38:04] Earth and God is the
[38:08] spirit now John look
[38:24] around amen
[38:27] that's how we recognize the
[38:33] prophet
[38:34] amen now the prophet says
[38:38] [Music]
[38:40] here you know here in another book he
[38:44] say you know men lives men that your
[38:49] place is your
[38:51] soul your place is your
[38:55] soul
[38:58] yes sorry sorry God bless you even in
[39:02] the book of in the book of The
[39:10] Rapture the prophet say
[39:13] so
[39:16] uh
