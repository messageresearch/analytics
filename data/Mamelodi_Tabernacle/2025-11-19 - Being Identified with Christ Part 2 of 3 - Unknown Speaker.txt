TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] Amen. Let me read. &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. They answered him. We are Abraham city are never in bondage to any man. Why? Why do you say &gt;&gt; Jesus said h this means that &gt;&gt; you are servant of sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They believe the words but disbelieve the word. If the son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham seed, but you want to kill me. What type of Abraham seed are you? Because my word not my words has no place in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if you are spiritual the Bible says and e as he spoke these words many believed him. So we would put their names down and say these are the ones who believe today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But many believe many. &gt;&gt; The Bible says put their name down. What's your name? &gt;&gt; Welcome in the house of the Lord. And later come around. Now they have to throw away that book &gt;&gt; because the same people who believed &gt;&gt; are now against &gt;&gt; amen. So &gt;&gt; it started &gt;&gt; but amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They would say amen. &gt;&gt; No, we we believe. Amen. Amen. Then the Bible says that he turned to them. Oh God bless you believers. So now you see um now he continued he continued now &gt;&gt; you believers now if you continue if you continue &gt;&gt; in my wedding that that's the the problem is just there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are meaning that we believe God but we don't believe him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the thing comes when he says if you continue in my he doesn't say in God's will in my Amen. That's why God said to the prophet, "Make them to believe you." Why? Because the word is given to you. It's in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses, don't speak to me. Speak to THESE PEOPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The the word is with you. Amen. that that's when the people would say &gt;&gt; where Moses &gt;&gt; you and your God &gt;&gt; you brought us here to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time man is involved or God comes as a man, it's just a troubles. I'm going to show you there's trouble in the message so-called message believers today. They believed the words but they don't believe the word &gt;&gt; the Facebook church can start working now right now and help the people out there. Now listen here now. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can stay here the whole day. Let me pass. I know that you are Abraham seed. But you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you. Amen. I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now each has a father. &gt;&gt; Let me leave this area. I know you are Abraham's seat, &gt;&gt; but now &gt;&gt; you've got a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen, I must stay identified where the word of God is being manifested. I'm back. The mighty God unveiled. God unveiled. You know &gt;&gt; you must stay identified. &gt;&gt; You must identify yourself &gt;&gt; whether you are this or you are not this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you can worship two gods. And if you come to God, the Bible says you must believe and come to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must believe and come to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your belief begs faith. Amen. No, no, no. Fa faith is revelation. By faith, Abraham looked for a city. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why he met Melkisedc because it was by the six sense. So he he went beyond five senses and met Melkisedc because through five senses you don't see Melkisedc you can't reach him. That is five senses. The rest could not see the promised land save Caleb and Joshua. They couldn't see it. They believed the words and they come to Caldisak. They couldn't go over that. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm identified with the group that knows his unveiled. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I can read on and on but you must be identified with something. Now let's let's look at this. Now when he says at that day &gt;&gt; you shall know that now you shall know. &gt;&gt; Now I know you you know &gt;&gt; you shall know that I am in you. It never said you shall read that I am in you. Now this is personal. You know Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I know then no man can tell me the truth because I know you know &gt;&gt; and you should know who you are. God's prophet says you should know. Have you read that book perfect faith? He says you should believe what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; If the word says we are Christ, I'm coming to that. If the word says we are Christ, then we are Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because where's that thing? Uh where's my pointer here? My finger won't work here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you need light. &gt;&gt; Now, here we are being identified with Christ. I'm I'm going to read it. Now, this is the photo that caused problems. &gt;&gt; This one. And this is the same thing that caused problems for Jesus. &gt;&gt; I and God are one. &gt;&gt; He is no longer preaching. He makes himself one with God. You see, they want God to to be a man to be a man &gt;&gt; who is protected that nobody gets near. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know people were blocked from but Jesus that's not how how we were not fool you jump in also. [cheering] Amen. Amen. Even a woman could come. &gt;&gt; You know the women those days did not have these hair. &gt;&gt; I mean the ones who walked with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the Jezebels of that day. This woman came and wiped his feet with with with her hair. We're still going to talk about those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to see a sister who can stand here and wipe Jesus feet. How about this one, sister? Do you think you know your hair wouldn't be messed up if you did that? &gt;&gt; Can you wipe Can you wipe his feet? Who can who can wipe his feet? Don't think salon was expensive. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hey, right. Oh, I didn't write it here. Christ. Yeah. Well, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. What we are trying to say here is that let's hear first &gt;&gt; that God &gt;&gt; what does he say &gt;&gt; about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that you can be able to identify yourself. First thing, let us make men in our image. &gt;&gt; Then as I continue reading and but who was he speaking to? He say he speaking to the son. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Okay. When was the son born? &gt;&gt; In Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; If you say he was speaking to the son, &gt;&gt; it was not Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it says &gt;&gt; the son &gt;&gt; who came out of the logos. &gt;&gt; No, the son was the logos. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And out of the logos &gt;&gt; came forth &gt;&gt; the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look at Jesus, he's both go God and men. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "No man knows the day and the hour." &gt;&gt; Even the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the son comes in a twofold one part Jesus Jesus is time where is it eh we don't have the full picture but I I'll say to it here is is the word now &gt;&gt; there you have twofold things there is an ordinary man that was born And another man was the word made flesh. Now the word made flesh is not a man that was born or the man who started by birth. Because the Bible says he that is born of God, &gt;&gt; born of so God GAVE BIRTH and the Bible says again a man that is born of woman. And that's why now &gt;&gt; we have those who were born, &gt;&gt; the Bible says they were born not of the will of flesh and blood. Amen. So these people is the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is not an ordinary man. &gt;&gt; Is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Born not of the will of flesh and blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why now we are here together. Some people can live a holy life here and some can't. Although they hear the word but it is impossible for them to live a godly life. Why they were born of the will of men and women. Amen. But those who who those who were born of God, they are the word made flesh. Amen. And now that's why the Bible says no man knows the day a man born of the will of flesh and blood. Now the prophet says even Jesus did not know. The Bible says even the son don't know. Now the son is twofold. One part is time. You don't know the day and then that is time. So time don't know when he will come. That is that is time. So that's why he says even the son don't know. It's referring to the natural son. Because Jesus came up to where he was a mediator after the resurrection, he became a mediator. But when he took the book, he came down and we we don't see him anymore because h Jesus went back to where he was. Now where he was is light. Amen. That's why the Bible says walk in the light as he is in the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I will read you the Bible here. &gt;&gt; You see, now he went back where he was &gt;&gt; and Christ &gt;&gt; the anointing &gt;&gt; came to men. Amen. Amen. Because as he says the last church age, if any man hear my voice and open the door, &gt;&gt; I will come into him. &gt;&gt; Now he can only come into him as Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I go into him like this? No. &gt;&gt; But something in me CAN GO IN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not this body. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. Let's go back here. 14. Let me go back to John 14 a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's look at John 14 &gt;&gt; now. Let's listen here a bit. &gt;&gt; John 14 chapter 20 says at that day 14 &gt;&gt; you shall know that I am in the father. &gt;&gt; Now the father was this rainbow. &gt;&gt; The spirit. &gt;&gt; That was the spirit. And here &gt;&gt; he made man in his own image from be men from being an attribute. So attributed to a spirit form and then now there he says let us make men in our image. Now the the the word says God was speaking to his subjects because the word Christ where is it? &gt;&gt; No here. Yeah. Here is the logos. &gt;&gt; Now the logos. &gt;&gt; That is Christ. That is the word. &gt;&gt; And the word was God. So God's picture says the seven colors of the rainbow. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he wanted to pose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Let us make men in our own image." Amen. Hallelujah. Can &gt;&gt; Can you take that? &gt;&gt; Saw that this morning. I can say &gt;&gt; I'm in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Last time there is a brother here. &gt;&gt; He met a sister saying, "Hey, I understand these days. that the TABERNACLE IS FULL OF PICTURES. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PICTURE OF BROTHER. &gt;&gt; The brother is writing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now brother, now brother. &gt;&gt; The brother said to &gt;&gt; why don't you come to come and see them? Is it like that &gt;&gt; that there's no more picture of brother? You know the Bible says there are people who lie. There are those who make lies. Amen. Amen. Know some just speak lies &gt;&gt; but others &gt;&gt; they make lies they bake life in an oven INSTEAD OF WALKING WITH A liar is better for him to be with a drunker. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want a person who is an unbeliever to speak the truth, just give him two bottles of beer. Amen. And [clears throat] then by the way, I'm going to tell you, you don't need You know, I know nothing. [laughter] I don't want to go there and there. Okay. &gt;&gt; Let us make men in our image. Amen. &gt;&gt; And John 6 verse44 6:44 you know that scripture &gt;&gt; before we close let me read for you and we I said we are going to pose for a photo &gt;&gt; because if I take a picture with Christ &gt;&gt; why don't you take yours with Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If Jesus cameus, &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY AND I GO TO JESUS. &gt;&gt; Let me pose for a photo with you afterwards. Now you come and question me. NOW LOOK AT HIM. NOW HE EVEN HAS A PICTURE. Why don't you take yours? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 6 verse 44. &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except the the father who has sent me draw him. Still going to talk about &gt;&gt; Jesus says I am from my father. So that no man can come to me &gt;&gt; except he also has come from the father because the prophet says men and god came from the same place that that is the word &gt;&gt; God himself said let us make man in our own image. So man and God came from the same place. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why countdown says &gt;&gt; uh God is a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For him to be known better to humans, &gt;&gt; he ps with Peter, John and Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; Amen. and men together standing together &gt;&gt; we have those pictures in the Bible &gt;&gt; Jesus with his disciples. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now if I brought that picture look there is no revelation there's nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? It is because in those days God didn't speak to thees &gt;&gt; he would speak in Jesus and whilst they looking up AND BEING UPON BUT JESUS GOD WAS HERE ON THEM. So if you look up for a long time, you get a bit brought back. They say don't make yourself God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I agree with you. &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; the word says &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh and we saw his glory, his glory and dwell among us. GOD WANTED TO TAKE HIMSELF A PICTURE WITH THE PEOPLE. dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; GOD WITH US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL, &gt;&gt; God with us. You could take a photo with God, &gt;&gt; but he was a man. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music]
