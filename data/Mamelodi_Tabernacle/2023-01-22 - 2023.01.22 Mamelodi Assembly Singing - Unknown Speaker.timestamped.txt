[1:01:37] he has decided to be baptized today
[1:01:40] may the lord of the sleepless
[1:01:42] [Applause]
[1:01:49] when we have no shedding normally we run
[1:01:54] our service
[1:01:55] with a generator
[1:01:58] so when we run the service with a
[1:02:00] generator
[1:02:01] unfortunately we don't switch all the
[1:02:04] aircons on
[1:02:06] so most of the icons
[1:02:08] will switch them off
[1:02:10] so that we can run the whole service
[1:02:13] with a generator
[1:02:15] but if we don't have load shading
[1:02:18] we switch all our icons on
[1:02:21] so just take note that
[1:02:24] sometimes
[1:02:25] especially the people at the balcony
[1:02:28] and under the balcony
[1:02:31] they will feel the heat
[1:02:33] when we are having load shedding
[1:02:36] the only aircon that we switch on is the
[1:02:39] icon in front and maybe two on the sides
[1:02:43] so just bear with us
[1:02:45] Hallelujah
[1:02:46] may the Lord richly bless you as we
[1:02:49] stand on our feet to welcome our
[1:02:52] precious pastor God bless you
