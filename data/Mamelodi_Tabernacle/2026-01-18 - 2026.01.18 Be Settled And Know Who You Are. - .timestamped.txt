[1:01:49] So the coring contractor is on site.
[1:01:57] waiting for the approval of the
[1:01:59] municipality.
[1:02:02] Once the municipality approve the plans,
[1:02:08] the cing contractor will remove part of
[1:02:11] the slab
[1:02:15] and the beams will be installed
[1:02:19] to carry the balcony.
[1:02:24] Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; The other thing is about the
[1:02:29] distribution box.
[1:02:34] So the electrical engineer
[1:02:39] gave us the codes
[1:02:42] to build the distribution box
[1:02:46] because the original one had to be moved
[1:02:51] to create the space for the believers.
[1:02:56] Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The second one is related to the
[1:03:00] sale of the Gamil drift plot.
[1:03:06] I'm sure you remember we had a plot that
[1:03:09] sight of drift.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; So the plot has been sold.
[1:03:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:21] It was sold in a cash transaction.
[1:03:26] So the plot has now been registered to
[1:03:29] the buyer.
[1:03:33] But the funds
[1:03:36] have not yet been paid over to the
[1:03:39] tabernacle
[1:03:44] because of the administration
[1:03:48] is incomplete
[1:03:51] due to some documents not yet submitted.
[1:03:57] So our auditors are helping us with
[1:04:00] those documents.
[1:04:04] Once they are done with the documents,
[1:04:09] the funds will be transferred into
[1:04:12] our tabernacle.
[1:04:17] So the trustees
[1:04:20] have put a deadline
[1:04:24] for the end of February.
[1:04:28] to complete the transaction.
[1:04:32] So it must be noted also
[1:04:37] that the sale was done through an estate
[1:04:39] agent
[1:04:43] agent and we also use the conveyor
[1:04:47] lawyers.
[1:04:51] So the funds are still with the
[1:04:53] conveyance lawyers.
[1:04:57] And later on it will be transferred
[1:05:01] once all the documents are complete.
[1:05:05] May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] We are also
[1:05:16] grateful.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; We were approached by few brothers.
[1:05:28] requesting to clean uh the park outside.
[1:05:37] So the deacons gave them authority
[1:05:42] and the neighbors
[1:05:45] came and said thank you.
[1:05:49] So we really appreciate
[1:05:53] what the brothers did.
[1:05:57] May they continue to do the good work.
[1:06:01] Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:06:05] remember we used to have a YouTube
[1:06:07] channel
[1:06:08] YouTube channel and the YouTube channel
[1:06:12] was closed.
[1:06:16] So the brothers have been working hard.
[1:06:20] to recover those messages that were
[1:06:22] lost.
[1:06:26] So we did a test run on Friday.
[1:06:31] So now we are pleased to announce
[1:06:36] that all those messages
[1:06:40] we are going to upload them again.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] So
[1:06:50] we have decided
[1:06:53] to upload them every Thursday evening
[1:07:01] because Thursday used to be the day of
[1:07:04] the tapes.
[1:07:08] So every Thursday
[1:07:12] we will upload a full message.
[1:07:18] Then you can watch that in your
[1:07:22] respective homes.
[1:07:26] We continue to
[1:07:30] have our Wednesday services
[1:07:36] but on Thursday
[1:07:38] we upload a full message
[1:07:42] that we lost in the previous channel.
[1:07:46] God bless you.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; We are also blessed this morning.
[1:07:56] Truly blessed.
[1:07:59] We have a friend of the pastor
[1:08:03] all the way from Matad.
[1:08:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:11] He came to say shalom to the church.
[1:08:13] Shalom.
[1:08:16] H
[1:08:18] just to remind you
[1:08:22] remember the picture of light.
[1:08:28] It was taken
[1:08:30] at Sabino Canyon Tabernacle Tabernacle
[1:08:35] in DRC Mati
[1:08:37] Mati.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; That's where
[1:08:40] Pastor Dango is.
[1:08:45] He is the one that invited the pastor
[1:08:49] and during that visit
[1:08:52] on the 3rd of July 2012
[1:08:55] July 2012
[1:08:58] during the evening service
[1:09:01] when the pastor
[1:09:04] preached the sermon titled perfect
[1:09:06] presentation
[1:09:09] perfectation.
[1:09:11] After that service
[1:09:14] A supernatural light was captured around
[1:09:16] the past.
[1:09:23] God confirming the ministry of pastor
[1:09:25] Israel.
[1:09:30] So we are truly blessed.
[1:09:34] The pastor is here to say shalom.
[1:09:37] Shalom. And the pastor is not alone.
[1:09:41] The pastor is with the bride.
[1:09:45] So I will ask
[1:09:48] sister just to stand
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; just to say shalom shalom.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And may the Lord richly bless you.
[1:09:59] Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] I'm told today we'll be going back on
[1:10:05] the 30th.
[1:10:09] So, we still have an opportunity
[1:10:13] just to say shalom to the pastor.
[1:10:16] Shalom. Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our precious pastor
[1:10:22] to come and greet the church.
[1:10:25] I will also ask brother David Katanga to
[1:10:28] come forth
[1:10:31] to assist with the interpretation.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Do you love our pastor?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] Can you just sing a song to welcome our
[1:10:42] pastor?
[1:10:46] God bless you.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Rock of agees
[1:10:52] for me.
[1:10:58] myself in me. Oh, let
[1:11:06] me remember
[1:11:09] from my
[1:11:14] pre
[1:11:34] Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:11:43] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Just like just said,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I'm coming from the DRC.
[1:12:00] This is not the first time for me to be
[1:12:01] here.
[1:12:06] I believe the patriarch
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; had allowed me to preach here I think
[1:12:16] three times
[1:12:24] and just before he left us to go and be
[1:12:26] with the Lord
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; when he was sick.
[1:12:34] And when he recovered,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; he called me
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; because when he passed at our church,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; where this supernatural picture was
[1:12:53] taken
[1:13:01] You can only understand the supernatural
[1:13:04] if you are really in that place.
[1:13:08] Brother was there.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It was a meeting with a very superior
[1:13:17] anointing.
[1:13:30] We felt the presence of the Lord during
[1:13:32] the service.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Not only this, not only this picture.
[1:13:42] But there were some other supernatural
[1:13:45] events that followed.
[1:13:51] We had in our church
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; a young couple that was married already,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; but they had no children.
[1:14:05] They went to see doctors.
[1:14:10] Myself, I had prayed for them.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; They spent a lot of years together
[1:14:17] without children.
[1:14:21] And when the pastor arrived in Matadi,
[1:14:28] I said to him, "We can put you in a
[1:14:30] hotel.
[1:14:37] But because I feel that you are a very
[1:14:39] supernatural and special person,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I saw it fit for me to put you in my
[1:14:49] bedroom.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:59] He was surprised,
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; but he accepted the offer.
[1:15:08] It is not a good house. A very good
[1:15:10] house.
[1:15:15] His house this side is much better than
[1:15:18] that house. My house back then.
[1:15:24] And I could imagine how comfortable was
[1:15:26] his bed home compared to mine.
[1:15:33] But he accepted without doubt to sleep
[1:15:35] in my bedroom.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; So
[1:15:47] yeah. So I took an opportunity.
[1:15:52] So I called that sister who could not
[1:15:54] bear children.
[1:15:58] After
[1:16:01] after that day when that picture was
[1:16:02] taken after the service,
[1:16:07] we had our breakfast in the morning
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; while he was still resting in the
[1:16:12] bedroom.
[1:16:16] I went and knocked at the door.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I think those those two sisters were
[1:16:23] there.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, they were there.
[1:16:29] And then I asked him to come out
[1:16:34] and I said to him that this sister
[1:16:36] cannot bear children. She has a serious
[1:16:38] problem.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Would you please pray for them?
[1:16:45] He didn't make a long and special
[1:16:47] prayer.
[1:16:51] He just made a very simple prayer.
[1:16:57] And the following month,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; that sister was pregnant, conceived
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; and she had a child
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; and ever since she added another child.
[1:17:16] Now they in Canada
[1:17:19] and that child is a grown up now.
[1:17:24] That is why pastor for me
[1:17:28] I call him the patriarch.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:17:37] when he called me
[1:17:42] he said to me was organizing meetings
[1:17:45] month of December.
[1:17:49] He called me uh via his son-in-law.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah, son-in-law. Yes.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; So the son-in-law spoke to me and said
[1:17:59] that we are organizing meetings for
[1:18:00] December
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; and they sent us invitations.
[1:18:07] While we still preparing to come,
[1:18:12] the Lord decided otherwise
[1:18:15] and took him back home.
[1:18:19] It made us very sad
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; in the church as well as at our homes.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; We were very certain,
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; but there's nothing that we can do.
[1:18:35] We are Christian.
[1:18:41] It's a man that fought and he died with
[1:18:44] a sword in his hand.
[1:18:55] I want I really wanted to attend the
[1:18:58] funeral
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't possible because I was not
[1:19:04] given the visa
[1:19:08] but I made sure to get a visa.
[1:19:14] Uh that's why because I had an issue on
[1:19:16] my left eye.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; I decided to come and share that sen
[1:19:28] together at least for one day.
[1:19:33] That is why I'm here
[1:19:36] with my wife
[1:19:39] because the Bible says to us
[1:19:43] Cry with those who cry
[1:19:48] and rejoice with them that rejoice.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That is why we present to you our
[1:19:57] condolences.
[1:20:01] Is not dead.
[1:20:06] Just changed the wedding place.
[1:20:12] If we had enough time,
[1:20:16] we could speak about this mystery.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; But maybe God will give us an
[1:20:22] opportunity to speak about it.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; You know the world in which we are
[1:20:28] living,
[1:20:35] it's a world where people are constantly
[1:20:38] changing habitations.
[1:20:41] Things keeps on changing.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Things keep on changing.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; And this is not our dwelling place.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; This is not our house.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; This is just a temple.
[1:21:00] We are here just for a little while.
[1:21:05] When the work is done,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; we have to move out.
[1:21:11] We have to leave this house
[1:21:16] to go into a better house.
[1:21:19] That house
[1:21:22] pastor spoke a lot about that house.
[1:21:29] That is how I feel.
[1:21:31] That is why.
[1:21:34] May the Lord be blessed
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; because he has taken his servant to go
[1:21:42] and rest. Hello.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; I just have a small word to tell you.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Just a very small word
[1:21:56] in Matthew chapter 26.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; If you we can read it together.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew.
[1:22:02] Matthew 26
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; verse 31.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Matthew 26 verse 23
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; 31 31 31
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; and then Matthew chapter 28
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; verse 7
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and verse 16.
[1:22:39] And uh the last scripture will be
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; the book of act
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; okay the book of Matthew 26:31 says
[1:22:54] then
[1:22:59] said Jesus unto
[1:23:01] All you shall be offended because of me
[1:23:04] this night.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; For it is written,
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I will smite the shepherd,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; and the sheep of the flock shall be
[1:23:16] scattered abroad.
[1:23:20] But
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; but after I am risen again,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; I will go before you into Galilee.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Notice here
[1:23:39] every man before dying,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; they always say their last words to the
[1:23:47] family.
[1:23:52] And those words that they attach to
[1:23:54] their families,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; those words the family can never forget
[1:24:01] them.
[1:24:06] They keep them.
[1:24:11] They keep them seriously.
[1:24:16] Jesus was about to die.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; He left them with this last word
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; and he said,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; "Today,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I'll be for you.
[1:24:32] I'm
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; sorry. Can you please
[1:24:35] Matthew 26:31?"
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Jesus said to them that all
[1:24:45] shall be offended because of me this
[1:24:47] night.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; For it is written,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I smite the shepherd,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; and the sheep of the flock shall be
[1:25:00] scattered abroad.
[1:25:02] But notice
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; smiting him didn't mean that they had to
[1:25:10] smite him physically
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and he had to run away
[1:25:17] and sheep would be scattered
[1:25:21] but he was announcing his departure.
[1:25:28] So the passing on of the shepherd who
[1:25:30] was Jesus
[1:25:32] himself. He said
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; that Satan will be will do all for the
[1:25:43] ship to be scattered after my departure.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; But notice
[1:25:51] Jesus himself who is announcing this
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; he says
[1:25:56] but you
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; do not be dismayed.
[1:26:02] remain united.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Remain together.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Go to Galilee.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Me.
[1:26:11] When I will die,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I will resurrect again.
[1:26:19] And I'll find you in Galilee united
[1:26:21] together.
[1:26:26] So what I'm about to tell my this
[1:26:28] morning
[1:26:30] The shepherd is gone.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; But remain united like one man.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Remain united like one man.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; There is a strength behind unity.
[1:26:52] That is why you will notice
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; in chapter 28 of Matthew,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; he says to them again,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; chapter uh Matthew 28
[1:27:05] verse 7
[1:27:08] when he
[1:27:10] when he resurrected, he met certain
[1:27:12] women.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And then he said to those women,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; notice what he said.
[1:27:22] and go quickly and tell his disciple
[1:27:24] that he is risen from the dead.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And behold, he goeth before you into
[1:27:31] Galilee.
[1:27:35] Notice in that in Galilee,
[1:27:39] he sent them to Galilee to be united.
[1:27:43] And when he had risen,
[1:27:49] He followed them in Galilee to find them
[1:27:51] united.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He insisted on unity.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:28:05] these women went to tell the disciples
[1:28:09] Jesus found them dead.
[1:28:13] And notice when he found them there,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; verse 16, Jesus said to them,
[1:28:27] "Then the 11 disciple went away into
[1:28:29] Galilee into the mountain where Jesus
[1:28:32] had appointed them."
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus went to find them united together
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and they said to them,
[1:28:46] And then in act
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; he recommend to them.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He recommend to the disciple
[1:28:58] chapter one.
[1:29:01] He says to the disciple,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; verse four,
[1:29:10] "And being assembled together with them,
[1:29:24] But wait
[1:29:26] for the promise of the Father,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; which said he, "You have heard of me."
[1:29:39] He sent them to Jerusalem to be united
[1:29:41] into one place
[1:29:43] and wait.
[1:29:45] But notice
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 14
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; verse 14 he says
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; this all
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; continued with one accord
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; in prayer
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; and supplication
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; in one accord
[1:30:15] in prayer
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; with the woman
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; and Mary,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; the mother of Jesus
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and with his brethren.
[1:30:31] Notice that all of them were all
[1:30:32] together.
[1:30:36] And in those day Peter stood up in his
[1:30:38] disciples.
[1:30:42] And the number of men of of names
[1:30:44] together
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; were about 120.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; They were all united together.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; They were all united together.

[1:31:15] place. Amen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Still united together.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; So after the departure of
[1:31:29] the church, you must do all in your
[1:31:30] power to remain united together.
[1:31:35] Respect.
[1:31:38] Respect the man that has worked with him
[1:31:41] before
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; who are guiding you.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Obey in those men.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Listen to the word of God
[1:31:54] and you will realize that with unity
[1:32:00] you'll always go forward and forward and

[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:12] preach a message
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; unity.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; In that message
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; in paragraph 15
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; I'm finishing now
[1:32:26] the prophet says this.
[1:32:36] It's a message that he preached on the
[1:32:38] 11th of February 62
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; united with God
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; 11th February 62
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; paragraph 15
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; every man with his family
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; infamy correct
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; a correct Family
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; born.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; noble.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Obisant.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Obedience. Obedience.
[1:33:26] They are always united
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; in bonf
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; a good family
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; noble
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; correct
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; correct
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; just
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; they are always united one
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; one another
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; they always united
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; if in the family
[1:33:49] something separate the people something
[1:33:51] separate the people
[1:33:55] correct And so that is not correct.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You must always avoid the splits and
[1:34:06] divisions.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; It continues
[1:34:20] the family. If there are divisions and
[1:34:22] separation
[1:34:26] The family is broken somewhere.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; They should always be one.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; The father and the mother.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; The mother and the father.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; The children and parent.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Parent with children.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; All.

[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; When you see that,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; you've got a beautiful image.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; That is the purpose of God.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; So this is my small exhortation.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Remain united. Continue
[1:35:25] to love the message.
[1:35:27] Love one another
[1:35:30] and the Lord will bless you.

[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Let us stand on our feet
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; in respect of the word of God.

[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] of the voice
[1:36:21] of the
[1:36:24] angel
[1:36:26] when he
[1:36:34] Jesus
[1:36:45] should be finished
[1:36:48] as he
[1:36:51] has he
[1:36:54] to
[1:36:57] the prophet.
[1:36:59] Behold,
[1:37:02] I will set you
[1:37:05] the light
[1:37:07] of the prophets
[1:37:10] before
[1:37:27] The hearts
[1:37:29] of the fathers
[1:37:32] to the children
[1:37:38] of the children
[1:37:40] to the father.
[1:37:44] Bless
[1:37:46] our God.
[1:37:49] Bless
[1:38:12] you.
[1:38:14] All
[1:38:16] his
[1:38:19] we
[1:38:37] holy ghost.
[1:38:43] Holy Ghost.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; I greet all the children of God this
[1:39:00] morning
[1:39:03] in the precious name of their master.
[1:39:11] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:39:14] I'm happy to be here this morning.
[1:39:20] After Elder Mete phoned me
[1:39:24] that we have got a visitor here,
[1:39:29] I said, "Well,
[1:39:32] I will never come there.
[1:39:35] the visitor will took over.
[1:39:39] But he said, "We have got some children
[1:39:41] of God who wanted to see you
[1:39:48] and they will be waiting for you."
[1:39:52] Because if you don't come this weekend,
[1:39:56] then it will be another weekend.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Then you have to come.
[1:40:04] That's why you see me here.
[1:40:11] I'm happy. I'm happy happy.
[1:40:15] I'm happy also to to welcome my pastor
[1:40:18] here.
[1:40:22] And I also happy to receive his
[1:40:27] warning
[1:40:32] and advises
[1:40:38] when he when he is advising the church.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You can sit down for a while.
[1:40:47] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:52] Somebody said you were here last year.
[1:41:00] Um, it's a long time.
[1:41:05] Well, I'm here this year.
[1:41:11] God, God bless you.
[1:41:14] H there is I I was supposed to see two
[1:41:19] family and one brother
[1:41:25] in before the service
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; and I I I wanted to
[1:41:32] flesh the cood
[1:41:37] but but I will not flesh it
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; because of time.
[1:41:44] um
[1:41:45] they wanted to come and worship.
[1:41:50] Then I wanted to show you what the
[1:41:52] prophet said about that.
[1:41:57] But uh because of the place we slept,
[1:42:04] they delayed me so much
[1:42:08] so that I couldn't catch time.
[1:42:13] So perhaps I will see them after the
[1:42:16] service.
[1:42:18] Then I allowed them to be in the service
[1:42:21] with us
[1:42:25] and they will be in the service with us.
[1:42:27] Don't wonder
[1:42:30] when you see them.
[1:42:34] I think is brother Al's son
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; and then brother I think something like
[1:42:42] that
[1:42:44] they are they are among us here
[1:42:48] don't don't don't be surprised when you
[1:42:50] see them
[1:42:53] they have told me about that
[1:42:57] then I will talk to them
[1:43:01] and then see how to help them
[1:43:05] because God want us to help one another.
[1:43:11] That is that is his that is his aim
[1:43:16] that while while standing on our feet
[1:43:18] because I don't want to waste your time.
[1:43:22] Let's read the book of uh Matthew
[1:43:25] chapter 13
[1:43:29] uh verse uh 24 to 30
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; uh verse 24
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; to 30
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; then um
[1:43:42] um
[1:43:44] we're going to read Revelation 7
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Remen
[1:43:52] Vers 7 to 9.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Verse 7 9
[1:43:56] Matthew 13 from verse 24.
[1:44:01] Another parable put he forth unto them,
[1:44:04] saying, "The kingdom of heaven is
[1:44:06] likened unto a man which saw good seed
[1:44:09] in his field. But while men slept, his
[1:44:13] enemy came and sought tears among the
[1:44:16] wheat, and went his way. But when the
[1:44:19] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[1:44:22] fruit, then appeared he appeared the
[1:44:25] tears also. So the servants of the
[1:44:28] householder came and said unto him, Sir,
[1:44:31] did not thou saw good seed in thy field?
[1:44:36] From whence then has it test?
[1:44:39] He said unto them, An enemy have done
[1:44:41] this. The servant said unto him, "Will
[1:44:45] thou then that we go and gather them
[1:44:47] up?" But he said, "Nay, lest while you
[1:44:51] gather up the tears, ye root up also the
[1:44:54] wheat with them. Let both grow together
[1:44:57] until the harvest, and in the time of
[1:45:00] harvest, I will say to the reapers,
[1:45:03] gather ye together first the tears, and
[1:45:06] buy them in bundles to burn them, but
[1:45:09] gather the wheat into my ben."
[1:45:12] Let's read Revelation
[1:45:14] 12:7.
[1:45:24] Revelation 12:7.
[1:45:27] And there was war in heaven. Michael and
[1:45:30] his angels fought against the dragon.
[1:45:33] And the dragon fought and his angels.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 7 to9.
[1:45:42] and prevailed not, neither was their
[1:45:45] place found anymore in heaven. And the
[1:45:48] great dragon was cast out,
[1:45:51] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:45:53] Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.
[1:45:57] He was cast out into the earth, and his
[1:46:00] angels were cast out with him. Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Let's do our eyes as we pray.
[1:46:07] De Father,
[1:46:11] thank you for granting us this privilege
[1:46:15] this morning.
[1:46:17] Your children are gathered here.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Waiting for you to speak to them.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here in your place. Yes,
[1:46:27] sir.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; With my brother here.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:32] We humbly beseech thee
[1:46:35] to use my voice and my brother's voice.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Convey your message to your children.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; The message you have for them this
[1:46:45] morning.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; The precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:46:49] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[1:46:58] I'm going to have a very
[1:47:01] short message God willing.
[1:47:07] The topic will be
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; be settled
[1:47:14] and know who you are.
[1:47:20] And if you know who you are,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; you'll be settled
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; when you take your car to the service.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:47:37] sometimes they will phone you.
[1:47:41] They say we are
[1:47:45] servicing your car into this plan here.
[1:47:54] We have seen something also
[1:47:58] that your rear bricks, your rear bricks,
[1:48:02] they're finished.
[1:48:05] Can we replace them?
[1:48:10] Then perhaps you say no
[1:48:14] later
[1:48:17] when we are here.
[1:48:20] We are in the service.
[1:48:23] Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; And you are here to be sav
[1:48:32] to service somebody.
[1:48:36] You are going to be saved. The service
[1:48:39] is going to be is going to be to you are
[1:48:42] going to be service yourself.
[1:48:47] You must listen the message and bring it
[1:48:50] to yourself.
[1:48:56] Not to somebody.
[1:49:02] After you after you have refused the
[1:49:05] garage to change your bricks,
[1:49:10] when you are following another car,
[1:49:15] When you come to the stop sign,
[1:49:19] when the the front car stops,
[1:49:23] when you try to stop,
[1:49:26] your brakes fails,
[1:49:29] then you bump against the front car,
[1:49:32] then you are going to pay more
[1:49:36] because the insurance of that car
[1:49:38] insurance, they will want money from you
[1:49:42] so that you can repair the car,
[1:49:46] but you should have allowed the garage
[1:49:51] to replace your brakes.
[1:49:54] Then you wouldn't have this problem.
[1:49:57] You must allow the garage today
[1:50:03] to replace your bricks.
[1:50:07] You must not refer it to next.
[1:50:13] I said, "I'm holding a mirror."
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I'm holding a mirror.
[1:50:20] Then I bring the mirror to you.
[1:50:24] You look in the mirror.
[1:50:27] What kind of a person is in that mirror?
[1:50:32] If you find yourself in that mirror
[1:50:36] that you are not dressing well,
[1:50:41] dress well.
[1:50:46] Don't blame the mirror.
[1:50:52] This mirror
[1:50:55] makes me like this.
[1:51:03] When I preach here,
[1:51:05] I'm not targeting any individual.
[1:51:14] I say be settled.
[1:51:18] Know who you are.
[1:51:24] You see when Cain and Abel
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; when they were bringing their
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; sacrifice
[1:51:34] they they have not talked together.
[1:51:40] It just come to them
[1:51:43] but they must go and worship.
[1:51:47] They worshiped according to what was in
[1:51:50] their hearts.
[1:51:55] Abel was not worried about Cain's
[1:51:58] sacrifice.
[1:52:02] He was doing his.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; But the problem was with K.
[1:52:09] He always look at a sacrifice.
[1:52:16] And when Abel sacrifice
[1:52:20] when God received Abel sacrifice
[1:52:25] was not worried about what is happening
[1:52:27] at Cain's place
[1:52:33] was sure of what he was doing.
[1:52:38] You must be sure of what you are doing.
[1:52:47] Satan might say
[1:52:50] you are not the child of God
[1:52:54] because of this and this.
[1:52:58] You must tell Satan,
[1:53:01] I am the child of God.
[1:53:06] You must not allow him
[1:53:10] to deviate you
[1:53:13] because of this and this.
[1:53:16] You seem not to be the child of God.
[1:53:19] Because if you are a sheep
[1:53:22] following the goats,
[1:53:26] you may act like the goats,
[1:53:31] but you are not a goat.
[1:53:34] But when they say to you,
[1:53:37] Don't go this way.
[1:53:39] Take this way because your nature you
[1:53:42] are not the goat.
[1:53:44] Then you will turn.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible here speaks about two sers
[1:54:01] who were sewing two different seeds.
[1:54:04] Amen.
[1:54:08] In the same field.
[1:54:13] And the Bible also tells us
[1:54:17] who those sers were.
[1:54:21] And the Bible also tells us
[1:54:25] who those seeds were.
[1:54:28] They were different.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; You see the the prophet says a thistle a
[1:54:37] thistle
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; cannot help
[1:54:42] to be a thistle.
[1:54:50] It is a thistle to start with.
[1:54:57] I said,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; you see, when Cain and Abel were
[1:55:01] bringing their sacrifice,
[1:55:04] the problem was inside.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; The problem was their seat.
[1:55:13] They were from different seats
[1:55:18] and Abel couldn't help Kane
[1:55:24] and Cain couldn't help Abel
[1:55:28] because they were from different things.
[1:55:35] Then the the Bible tells us that
[1:55:40] the first Ser was God himself
[1:55:45] and the second was Satan
[1:55:49] but they saw their seed in the same
[1:55:51] field.
[1:55:56] He says here
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; if the brothers can flesh something
[1:56:01] there
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; in the book of um
[1:56:08] seat is not the seed of discrepancy.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; If they can fly something we can go on.
[1:56:18] If they don't have it we will go on.
[1:56:25] It is what the prophet says here.
[1:56:31] Paragraph 20 to 26.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 20 26.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; He says here,
[1:56:38] notice who he said that the ser were
[1:56:44] also what the seed was.
[1:56:48] One was he the son of God.
[1:56:54] who went forth sowing seat.
[1:56:58] An enemy came behind him
[1:57:01] which was the devil
[1:57:04] and saw the seed of discretion
[1:57:10] behind the sewing of the right seed.
[1:57:16] Now friends that has happened through
[1:57:20] every age
[1:57:24] since we have had the world
[1:57:30] exactly all the way from the beginning.
[1:57:35] It started the very same thing.
[1:57:41] He set the seed of God
[1:57:46] The word of God.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in a certain place that the
[1:57:53] word is a seed
[1:57:57] and every seed will bring forth of its
[1:58:00] kind.
[1:58:04] And now if the Christians,
[1:58:08] the children of God, the children of the
[1:58:11] kingdom
[1:58:13] has become the seed of God,
[1:58:16] they must be the word of God.
[1:58:22] The word of God manifested in the age
[1:58:30] they are living in.
[1:58:32] for the promised seat for that age.
[1:58:38] God gave his weight at the beginning
[1:58:43] and each age has has had its seat
[1:58:52] and its time and is promise.
[1:58:58] When Noah come on the sin,
[1:59:01] he was the seed of God
[1:59:05] for the word of God for that age.
[1:59:10] Don't forget that there were also
[1:59:12] another seed.
[1:59:16] We find them in the the book of first
[1:59:18] Peter chapter 2 there
[1:59:22] first and they say they are angels who
[1:59:25] were disobedient.
[1:59:30] They say they were ministers.
[1:59:34] Noah was preaching
[1:59:36] and they were also preaching.
[1:59:40] In other words, those seats were there
[1:59:42] in each age.
[1:59:47] Each age has got the seed of God
[1:59:51] and each age has the seed of Satan.
[1:59:56] Then you must be settled
[2:00:00] and know who you are
[2:00:03] in this age in the age you are living
[2:00:06] in.
[2:00:08] Look in the word of God.
[2:00:11] Whether you are going according to the
[2:00:14] way
[2:00:16] because if you are his seat,
[2:00:20] you will go according to his way.
[2:00:24] But if you are not his seat, you will go
[2:00:27] according to someone's way,
[2:00:32] not his, not his way.
[2:00:36] Amen.
[2:00:38] because his seat
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; he said something here. Let me read it
[2:00:43] before I let me leave it there.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; The same the the prophet the prophecy
[2:00:50] the same Holy Spirit
[2:00:55] but let me start there each seat through
[2:00:59] different each each seat
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; though different
[2:01:05] though different
[2:01:08] They will utilize the same earth
[2:01:15] and they will utilize the same
[2:01:17] nourishment
[2:01:22] and they utilize the same moisture.
[2:01:28] They will utilize the same sunshine
[2:01:33] but they will bring their own food.
[2:01:41] They will never bring different fruit.
[2:01:46] Although they are receiving the same
[2:01:51] even if they receive the same message
[2:01:55] but they will bring their different
[2:01:57] fruits
[2:02:02] because they are different seed
[2:02:06] that is what the prophet says
[2:02:09] it's not what I'm saying here
[2:02:12] the same holy spirit
[2:02:14] that anoints the church
[2:02:18] that gives them the desire to save souls
[2:02:23] that gives them power to perform
[2:02:25] miracles.
[2:02:28] It will fall on the just and the unjust.
[2:02:34] So we must not look at miracles.
[2:02:39] We must look at the word of God
[2:02:43] whether this thing
[2:02:45] is according to the word of God.
[2:02:49] And if it is if it is according to the
[2:02:51] word of God,
[2:02:53] we must say amen to that. Amen. But if
[2:02:57] it doesn't go according to the word, we
[2:03:00] must stand.
[2:03:05] He says here,
[2:03:09] And when they do the same genuine thing,
[2:03:17] BUT THE PROBLEM
[2:03:19] is the inside.
[2:03:22] The anointing is the same.
[2:03:26] They speak in tones. This one speak in
[2:03:28] tones. This one speak in tones. This one
[2:03:31] perform miracles. This one perform
[2:03:32] miracles. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE INSIDE.
[2:03:39] But if you cannot if you cannot be
[2:03:42] careful,
[2:03:44] they will deceive even the elected.
[2:03:49] Because it seems as they are doing the
[2:03:52] same thing
[2:03:55] but the problem
[2:03:57] is the inside.
[2:03:59] Cain came to worship
[2:04:03] with the wrong seat inside
[2:04:09] the seat can't stop you to worship.
[2:04:16] You will go and worship.
[2:04:18] It depends what seed is in you.
[2:04:22] But when I'm teaching here, don't let
[2:04:25] Satan
[2:04:27] say to you, you are the wrong seat.
[2:04:31] You must you must RESIST THE DEVIL.
[2:04:35] HE WILL FLEE AWAY. When he said to you,
[2:04:39] you are the wrong seed. You must say no,
[2:04:41] I am not.
[2:04:45] Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; That is the the flesh did there.
[2:04:56] He said, "But notice
[2:05:00] Cain come to worship,
[2:05:02] but he had the wrong seat in him,
[2:05:08] the serpent's seat.
[2:05:10] We know that."
[2:05:15] But he came to worship.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; We see these ones here
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; in the end time.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; My brother, you can read Matthew chapter
[2:05:31] 7
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; verse 21.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Verse 21.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; When you flesh seven church ages,
[2:05:39] seven church ages.
[2:05:42] Matthews 7 21
[2:05:45] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[2:05:48] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[2:05:51] heaven
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; but he that doeth the will of my father
[2:05:55] which is in heaven
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; it says there
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; not everyone
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; who says to me
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Lord Lord
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; shall enter the kingdom
[2:06:14] But he that doeth the will of my father,
[2:06:18] which is in heaven,
[2:06:21] many will say to me in that day,
[2:06:26] which day is day,
[2:06:30] many shall say to me in that day,
[2:06:34] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[2:06:37] thy name?
[2:06:40] in thy name have cast out the devils
[2:06:45] in thy name done many wonderful works
[2:06:50] and then will I prophesy unto them.
[2:06:55] I never knew you
[2:06:59] depart from me that work iniquity.
[2:07:05] Jesus does not deny that they did mighty
[2:07:08] works,
[2:07:12] that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish
[2:07:15] by way of man.
[2:07:21] But he did deny ever knowing them.
[2:07:27] They weren't backsliders.
[2:07:31] These were wicked.
[2:07:35] and regenerated
[2:07:38] reprobate.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; This
[2:07:43] were the seat of Satan.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; They've done this wonderful works.
[2:07:54] They came even before the Lord
[2:07:58] that we have done this.
[2:08:00] He didn't deny that. He said you have
[2:08:03] done it but you are of a wrong seed.
[2:08:09] I don't know you because you are not
[2:08:12] sown by me.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; There are people in our age.
[2:08:22] Brother Bren speaks about the beatles.
[2:08:27] He says those Beatles
[2:08:31] they were wicked
[2:08:38] but they were doing wonderful works.
[2:08:48] He said I just reading in the media.
[2:08:51] Okay. He said, "I just want to show you
[2:08:55] that the hour that you are living in is
[2:08:58] shocking.
[2:09:03] You might not understand it,
[2:09:06] but people try to understand it.
[2:09:10] What these things are?
[2:09:13] I've asked brother Cap.
[2:09:17] Brother Keaps read the article on the
[2:09:20] Beatles.
[2:09:25] The Beatles.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; The Beatles wonder about themselves. The
[2:09:28] Beatles
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; and not they throw no answer.
[2:09:37] They are root.
[2:09:40] They are profane.
[2:09:43] They are valka.
[2:09:46] They have taken over the world.
[2:09:50] In Australia,
[2:09:52] for example,
[2:09:53] time we would arrive at an airport.
[2:09:59] When the prophet arrived at the airport,
[2:10:04] the road were lined solid.
[2:10:10] Cribles threw away their sticks.
[2:10:15] Sick people rushed up to the car.
[2:10:20] as if as if a touch from one of the boys
[2:10:27] would make them well again.
[2:10:30] Old women stood watching with their
[2:10:32] grandchildren.
[2:10:36] All these people were happy,
[2:10:39] relief as if somehow
[2:10:44] something better is is is here.
[2:10:48] Now you can't now you can see that you
[2:10:52] can't put your trust in healing
[2:10:54] campaign.
[2:10:59] You can't put your trust in any kind of
[2:11:02] science like that.
[2:11:08] The only thing you can put your trust in
[2:11:14] is thus sayaith the Lord from the Bible.
[2:11:21] Now church that is exactly where I have
[2:11:24] tried to keep you my children.
[2:11:29] If something happens to me
[2:11:33] and God takes me out of this earth,
[2:11:36] don't you never fail.
[2:11:39] Remember this with all your heart.
[2:11:43] Stay with the weight.
[2:11:46] Don't live that way.
[2:11:48] Anything contrary to it,
[2:11:51] leave it alone.
[2:11:54] No matter what it is,
[2:11:56] then you know it is right.
[2:12:01] Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've told you
[2:12:07] stay with the way. Don't look at this
[2:12:09] miracle,
[2:12:11] but stay with it."
[2:12:15] What does the word say about that?
[2:12:18] If somebody says something,
[2:12:20] you might say, "What does the word says
[2:12:22] about that?"
[2:12:27] This seed of Satan,
[2:12:29] this seed of Satan,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; they are sometimes called fallen angels.
[2:12:39] Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Or Satan's angels.
[2:12:45] Amen. Brother Brennham says in this book
[2:12:48] here,
[2:12:50] he says they are even here in Jefferson
[2:13:00] these fallen angels.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here.
[2:13:08] In other words, when we are living,
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; we must be settled
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; and know who we are.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; But we must know we are leaving a man
[2:13:24] of people who will perhaps try
[2:13:29] to emulate us.
[2:13:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; It is the same devil
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; in a religious in a religious form
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; that persecuted Christ.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; It's the same devil
[2:13:52] that is in the church today
[2:13:56] wearing wrong wearing long ropes.
[2:14:01] They don't have to wear
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; I don't mean the robe over their body.
[2:14:06] Oh,
[2:14:09] I mean the rope on your soul.
[2:14:13] Why the days why the days of miracles is
[2:14:16] passed?
[2:14:20] There is no such a thing. You talk about
[2:14:24] modern Pharisees.
[2:14:27] That is exactly
[2:14:30] they will have a form of godliness
[2:14:35] but we deny the power
[2:14:39] from such turn away.
[2:14:43] Get away from it. Just stay. Just stay.
[2:14:46] Keep yourself away.
[2:14:50] That's still them sons of God. Sorry. It
[2:14:53] is still them sons of God.
[2:14:57] But they are in a fallen condition.
[2:15:02] See what I mean? Some of them are
[2:15:06] ministers.
[2:15:08] Some of them are deacons.
[2:15:11] Some of them are elders.
[2:15:14] Some of them are bishops.
[2:15:17] Just as pur as they can be,
[2:15:22] they are here in Jefferson.
[2:15:28] If I can say they here in
[2:15:38] don't fight with me.
[2:15:43] That's why he says you must be sure
[2:15:49] the church you are going to
[2:15:54] who is teaching you.
[2:15:58] Amen.
[2:16:00] I want to check something here if I can
[2:16:03] find it. Yeah.
[2:16:08] Because
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; you'll find you are taught by the fallen
[2:16:12] angel.
[2:16:25] There is he says here there is something
[2:16:28] about
[2:16:30] where you go,
[2:16:32] what church you go to,
[2:16:36] what teacher teaches you,
[2:16:39] do you know that it is it's got
[2:16:42] something to it.
[2:16:44] Therefore, we ought to seek out THE VERY
[2:16:47] BEST.
[2:16:51] THAT WE CAN FIND. So we are getting the
[2:16:54] best
[2:16:57] not because it is soable
[2:17:02] so forth but the the real Bible teaching
[2:17:10] that is that is what we are getting
[2:17:11] here. We are getting the best.
[2:17:16] Amen. a real
[2:17:20] Bible teaching.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; If someone can say this is not the
[2:17:25] seals,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; he he he he doesn't know what seals are.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here.
[2:17:41] Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Someone may say,
[2:17:44] "Hi, it's long time.
[2:17:47] We are we are listening here.
[2:17:50] We want to hear seals.
[2:17:55] We don't hear seals here. We hear people
[2:17:58] talking."
[2:18:01] But but
[2:18:06] he doesn't know what seals are.
[2:18:11] Because
[2:18:15] the the the prophet
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; is the one who
[2:18:20] taught us about these two seats.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; And then he's the one who told us what
[2:18:29] these seats are.
[2:18:34] And he was warning us about these seats.
[2:18:40] Then we must warn one one another
[2:18:45] about these seeds.
[2:18:48] We must not be influenced by them.
[2:18:54] We must be away from them.
[2:18:58] This book it it is the rising of the
[2:19:01] sun. It's the rising of the sun. He said
[2:19:04] page I think 307
[2:19:07] paragraph 307 paragraph 307
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I just read it in the med because I want
[2:19:11] to be fast
[2:19:14] and in that day
[2:19:17] in that they didn't know what it was
[2:19:23] and we knew we knew
[2:19:26] just look this way
[2:19:29] is our Lord up there
[2:19:32] he was talking about that cloud.
[2:19:35] He said it is our Lord Abdul.
[2:19:39] He is the one who opened those seals.
[2:19:45] He was talking about that cloud.
[2:19:48] That is the one that opened that cloud.
[2:19:52] He said those seven supernatural angels
[2:19:57] brought they brought that book.
[2:20:01] Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Let me go on here.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; He said
[2:20:08] he is the one who opened those seals.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; He is those seals
[2:20:16] for the whole word of God
[2:20:20] is Christ.
[2:20:23] Amen. He is the one who open those
[2:20:26] seals.
[2:20:28] He is those seals.
[2:20:31] What is the opening of the seal?
[2:20:34] He said, he said Christ is the seals
[2:20:38] that was opened.
[2:20:42] And what is the opening of the seals
[2:20:45] then?
[2:20:48] Is revealing Christ.
[2:20:53] Amen. All right, we shall come back
[2:20:56] there.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; We just pass there.
[2:21:01] We are not these bodies.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; But we are living in these bodies.
[2:21:11] These bodies, this flesh
[2:21:15] comes from the same place.
[2:21:21] the other seat
[2:21:24] and the the wrong seat
[2:21:27] and the true seats. They are in these
[2:21:30] bodies
[2:21:33] and they they are the same in these
[2:21:36] bodies
[2:21:38] and these bodies come from the same
[2:21:40] place
[2:21:42] dust
[2:21:44] and it goes back to dust.
[2:21:50] Amen.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; And the real us
[2:21:54] is the seat inside
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; is not the body.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Let me check the book of rapture if I
[2:22:04] can find it.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; It says here
[2:22:08] when it talks about the real us.
[2:22:15] It says here,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; look in this page state paragraph. It
[2:22:20] says here, look here, you are a tune
[2:22:24] being
[2:22:26] inside of this little fellow.
[2:22:30] Here is a soul.
[2:22:32] The next is a spirit.
[2:22:34] The next is a body. Now you got five
[2:22:38] senses in this building
[2:22:41] to conduct the earthly home.
[2:22:43] They don't conduct the rest of it.
[2:22:47] You got five senses of the spirit.
[2:22:52] Love and conscious so forth.
[2:22:56] But in here
[2:22:59] is where you live.
[2:23:02] That is what you are
[2:23:06] in the soul in the third.
[2:23:10] That is what you are.
[2:23:13] That is where you live
[2:23:15] in there.
[2:23:17] Is you is either is you and Satan
[2:23:22] or is you and God.
[2:23:25] That is you there. It depends who is
[2:23:28] with you there.
[2:23:35] It depends
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; who is with you there.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; But you are in there.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Let me read this one.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; This one page 30 works his faith
[2:23:52] expressed. Let me run fast.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; It says here
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; paragraph 206. Let me run. Paragraph 206
[2:24:00] it speaks about the same thing
[2:24:03] but it is it is what it is in the court
[2:24:10] that is where you can intellectually can
[2:24:13] accept it
[2:24:19] for sure that looks good
[2:24:22] I believe that still don't do it
[2:24:28] and the spirit can actually make witness
[2:24:30] of it.
[2:24:34] I I I've I've
[2:24:37] me something there. Okay,
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; let me start from 25.
[2:24:41] Now the outside body
[2:24:44] has five inlets
[2:24:47] and conduct your home.
[2:24:50] We have talked about
[2:24:52] and the inside which is the spirit
[2:24:57] five senses.
[2:24:58] But the inside of that
[2:25:02] the soul
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; has only one thing
[2:25:06] that is where you live.
[2:25:13] He says because if that soul hasn't come
[2:25:17] from God,
[2:25:20] it can make all impersonations out here,
[2:25:26] but it cannot be real.
[2:25:30] You can act healing.
[2:25:35] You can act like you have it.
[2:25:38] You can act like you receive it.
[2:25:42] A Christian can act like they are
[2:25:45] Christians
[2:25:47] and act
[2:25:49] and act and be and act and be ever so
[2:25:53] good
[2:25:56] at it. But that don't mean they are
[2:25:59] safe.
[2:26:02] That is exactly right. See the spirit
[2:26:05] can be there.
[2:26:08] The real spirit, genuine spirit, the
[2:26:11] Holy Spirit can anoint you. But that
[2:26:15] still don't mean you are saved.
[2:26:20] It's that inside
[2:26:24] that never dies.
[2:26:26] It is what eternal.
[2:26:29] It always was eternal.
[2:26:34] It come from God. It goes to God.
[2:26:38] is the soul.
[2:26:40] That is the reason I say people can jump
[2:26:43] up and down,
[2:26:46] SPEAK IN TONGUES, people can shout, lay
[2:26:50] hands on the sick
[2:26:52] and heal the sick, so forth, by faith,
[2:26:56] all these great things
[2:26:59] there by the spirit, but still be lost.
[2:27:07] Amen.
[2:27:10] Amen.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; We we come through the same field.
[2:27:18] We came through that
[2:27:21] which is a woman.
[2:27:23] Amen. A woman has got a field
[2:27:27] and we came through that field
[2:27:30] and because of that field
[2:27:33] being two seats
[2:27:36] we came through this
[2:27:39] but we were defiled
[2:27:42] by that field
[2:27:44] and when we came through that field
[2:27:47] we came being controlled
[2:27:51] from the fifth dimension.
[2:27:54] Because the Bible says we were born
[2:27:58] sinners.
[2:28:01] The Bible says
[2:28:03] we were we were born in sin
[2:28:08] in iniquity
[2:28:10] coming to the earth speaking li.
[2:28:13] That's why you can see a small child.
[2:28:18] You you have not taught him to be angry.
[2:28:23] You you you'll find that the mother said
[2:28:28] he's angry
[2:28:32] is biting his mother's priest.
[2:28:37] Why?
[2:28:39] Because he's born a sinner.
[2:28:43] He he born through that channel.
[2:28:46] This channel defiled us.
[2:28:49] But we were not sinners before. Amen.
[2:28:54] But because we we we came through the
[2:28:56] channel,
[2:28:58] then we find ourselves controlled
[2:29:02] from the fifth dimension by Satan
[2:29:06] speaking lies stealing,
[2:29:12] hating other people
[2:29:15] because of that filth.
[2:29:19] Are you together with me? Let me just
[2:29:22] read another book here so that you can
[2:29:24] hear that is the prophet
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; who says that one.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; It's not me.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Don't say I'm talking about somebody
[2:29:40] you will be talking a lie.
[2:29:43] I'm talking about the two seats.
[2:29:47] I don't know you are the seed of Satan.
[2:29:51] You are the seed of God. I don't say
[2:29:54] that
[2:29:55] if you if you prepare if you if if you
[2:29:58] want to call yourself the seat of Satan.
[2:30:02] It's up to you.
[2:30:05] Don't say tell people this.
[2:30:15] I'm tell you about the two seeds.
[2:30:19] They are here.
[2:30:21] Amen.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Whether we like it or not,
[2:30:25] even if you can close our eyes,
[2:30:28] even if we can sleep, but those things
[2:30:31] are
[2:30:38] easy.
[2:30:41] Amen. He says um
[2:30:45] the first life of your first in the book
[2:30:48] of the union of the bride and the
[2:30:50] bridegroom
[2:30:52] page 30
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; he says the first life of your first
[2:30:57] union.
[2:31:02] Let me start life. Life is a second
[2:31:05] thing to God.
[2:31:08] It is it is recorded in a book
[2:31:12] and God is the author of life.
[2:31:16] Do you believe that our natural life
[2:31:20] here
[2:31:22] we have here is just a perfection
[2:31:28] because of birth.
[2:31:31] Amen. Our life here is just a per
[2:31:37] it is it really should be the right life
[2:31:40] to begin with
[2:31:44] but is it is pered by natural birth
[2:31:51] that is what I'm telling you
[2:31:55] our birth
[2:31:58] has defiled us you come this
[2:32:02] been clean.
[2:32:05] When you come through this channel,
[2:32:08] you become dirty.
[2:32:13] You start to be a liar.
[2:32:18] that you be a thief
[2:32:24] because because of the channel you came
[2:32:27] through
[2:32:29] controlled by the fifth from the fifth
[2:32:31] dimension.
[2:32:33] That's why read John 5:4. Let's hear
[2:32:37] that 524.
[2:32:43] Before you read that, let me read
[2:32:44] another here.
[2:32:47] How did you come to do this?
[2:32:50] You were deceived into it
[2:32:54] by your first marriage.
[2:32:58] You are transparency.
[2:33:02] It is not your fault. It is not your
[2:33:04] fault of It is not fault of your own.
[2:33:08] By your natural birth,
[2:33:12] you come after Eve
[2:33:14] who committed a
[2:33:18] you were deceived into it.
[2:33:22] It is not your fault,
[2:33:25] you never did it because that little gem
[2:33:28] that was in you
[2:33:32] was to be in you before the foundation
[2:33:34] of the world.
[2:33:38] It is not your fault.
[2:33:40] It's because of the birth you came
[2:33:42] through.
[2:33:44] You were defiled by that.
[2:33:50] Amen.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; You are not a sinner to start with.
[2:33:56] Amen. Because
[2:33:59] since started in heaven
[2:34:02] when Satan preached
[2:34:05] and they believed him, they disbelieved
[2:34:09] Michael
[2:34:11] because sin is unbelief.
[2:34:15] When they disbelieve Michael,
[2:34:17] they became sinners.
[2:34:24] Let me read this one. book can read is
[2:34:27] the original. I'm going to read that
[2:34:28] one.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; It says,
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; well, that is the same thing from
[2:34:33] predestination.
[2:34:36] You are supposed to be here in the right
[2:34:38] way
[2:34:40] at the beginning because you are the
[2:34:43] seat soon by God.
[2:34:46] You you you should you should be you
[2:34:49] should have been here in the right way
[2:34:54] being that you come the way you did
[2:34:59] you were subject to the fall
[2:35:03] being that you are predestinated
[2:35:07] you hear the weight it brings you right
[2:35:10] back where you were pestinated
[2:35:16] What makes you believe the word of God?
[2:35:20] Turn down these other things and turn
[2:35:24] down this other thing
[2:35:27] because
[2:35:28] there is something in you
[2:35:31] way back beyond that. You are made to
[2:35:34] live here forever.
[2:35:39] All that he FORNEEW
[2:35:43] all that he has called
[2:35:46] has justified
[2:35:48] all that he has justified
[2:35:50] he has already glorified
[2:35:53] the only thing I am doing. All right.
[2:35:58] Amen.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; What is the use of preaching brother?
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Why would you preach?
[2:36:09] The prophet answered
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; all that he said there is there is a
[2:36:15] crop out there
[2:36:24] and he said now
[2:36:26] there is a crop out there
[2:36:31] only thing I am doing is sinning is
[2:36:34] saying
[2:36:43] that is what I'm doing here.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; Because there is a there is a crop out
[2:36:48] there.
[2:36:50] I'm just throwing
[2:36:52] it out there
[2:36:56] where it goes.
[2:36:58] If they are repellent,
[2:37:01] the the grease of mark of the world
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; and the denomination,
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; it can't help it. But if there is one
[2:37:14] out there
[2:37:16] that can absorb,
[2:37:19] he will tend to be a son and affect.
[2:37:25] Amen. Read brother
[2:37:28] John 5:4
[2:37:32] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[2:37:35] heareth my word and believe on him that
[2:37:38] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[2:37:42] not come into condemnation, but is
[2:37:44] passed from death unto life.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; We were born in there.
[2:37:51] That's what the Bible says. Those who
[2:37:53] hear my word,
[2:37:56] where do we hear the weight from?
[2:37:59] We feel we hear the word because we are
[2:38:01] born in there.
[2:38:04] He said the Bible says we will move from
[2:38:07] there
[2:38:09] because we have got eternal life.
[2:38:13] Those who hear
[2:38:15] are those who have heard.
[2:38:18] But we are all there
[2:38:21] in that conglomeration.
[2:38:24] Then because we are born there,
[2:38:27] the word OF GOD COME THERE.
[2:38:30] When the word of God is spoken
[2:38:33] because it is spoken, we are in death.
[2:38:39] Then we hear the word. We are all there.
[2:38:44] THE TWO SEATS.
[2:38:47] WE are all when the word of God comes.
[2:38:51] When the word comes, it separates.
[2:38:55] Amen.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; He that had an ear, let him hear. Amen.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; But
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 13,
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; verse 13,
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; verse 13,
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; we hear the word together,
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; but the other group
[2:39:17] The weight cannot help them.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; But we hear it together.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; That's what the word didn't help Kane.
[2:39:32] They said if you can do like your
[2:39:36] brother
[2:39:39] when the word speaks
[2:39:41] is the more he got angry.
[2:39:46] If there's someone here who the word
[2:39:49] when the word speaks
[2:39:51] the more he got angry
[2:39:54] that is up to him.
[2:39:57] But the person we have seen doing like
[2:40:00] that
[2:40:02] it was
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; all right. You can read the Bible.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Matthews 13:13.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Therefore speak I to them in parables
[2:40:14] because they see not and hearing they
[2:40:18] hear not neither do they understand.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Up to 60.
[2:40:25] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:40:28] Isaiah's which said, "By hearing you
[2:40:32] shall hear and shall not understand, and
[2:40:35] seeing you shall see and shall not
[2:40:37] perceive. For this people's heart is
[2:40:40] works cross and their ears are dull of
[2:40:43] hearing and their eyes they have closed.
[2:40:47] Lest at any time they should see with
[2:40:49] their eyes and hear with their ears
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; and should understand with their heart
[2:40:55] and should be converted and I should
[2:40:58] heal them.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, their
[2:41:00] ears are blocked.
[2:41:04] feel.
[2:41:06] Amen.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; Because if they can hear, God will save
[2:41:11] them.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; But even if they the word is speech,
[2:41:18] if you can jump and
[2:41:21] throw your head on the floor,
[2:41:26] they will just see this mad man
[2:41:32] because they are ears.
[2:41:34] are dull to hear.
[2:41:37] If they can be if they can hear they
[2:41:41] will be safe.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; He said here.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; Blessed
[2:41:48] are your eyes
[2:41:51] for they see
[2:41:53] and your ears for they hear.
[2:41:58] Amen.
[2:41:59] You are all there
[2:42:03] but some ears
[2:42:06] they hear
[2:42:08] some ears
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; they don't hear
[2:42:16] other group when they hear the weight
[2:42:20] they come out
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; because Jesus came to save them.
[2:42:27] He knew that you will born in that way.
[2:42:32] Then he said, "I will come and save my
[2:42:35] child
[2:42:37] because he's born in that way."
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:42:45] Jesus came to save his.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't know his.
[2:42:56] is not sure.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; What is sure about
[2:43:03] is those who are called Satan
[2:43:06] worshippers.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; Satan worshippers.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; But Satan is of those Satan is sure of
[2:43:13] those.
[2:43:15] But those who are in the churches,
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; he's not sure whether they are his
[2:43:23] or not.
[2:43:27] Because when he saw you say, "Amen."
[2:43:31] Amen.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. This one is
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; But only God
[2:43:39] sees the heart.
[2:43:42] Amen.
[2:43:44] Amen.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Let me read here
[2:43:48] in this book. No, I did not. Now, the
[2:43:51] only way up here in this spheres
[2:43:56] that you could ever
[2:43:58] that that you you could ever be in this
[2:44:01] little inside man.
[2:44:06] Let me jump others here.
[2:44:10] I was in Christ.
[2:44:13] You were in Christ
[2:44:16] the foundation of the world. He came to
[2:44:20] redeem his own,
[2:44:23] his own that was in him.
[2:44:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His children
[2:44:30] that was in.
[2:44:33] He never came to save the devil's
[2:44:36] children.
[2:44:39] They will never know it.
[2:44:43] And they will never understand.
[2:44:46] They will never listen.
[2:44:52] You see the Pharisees,
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; they were saying, you hear this boy,
[2:44:59] we know his mother and his father.
[2:45:04] That is the type of the spirit of
[2:45:05] Pharisees.
[2:45:09] If you preach,
[2:45:12] they speak something.
[2:45:15] Amen.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus was there,
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; they say we know this boy.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; When people say, "Amen.
[2:45:37] We know how he was born.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Let me read here.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; God vindicates that.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; God vindicates that
[2:45:51] that is always been right.
[2:45:54] What is this to be true?
[2:45:57] Show plainly the predestinated is the
[2:46:00] only one
[2:46:04] who are considered in redemption.
[2:46:09] The predestinated is the only ONE
[2:46:13] that is considered in redemption.
[2:46:18] People might be making like they think
[2:46:21] they are
[2:46:24] But the real redemption
[2:46:26] is those that are predestinated
[2:46:31] because the very word redeem
[2:46:34] means bring back.
[2:46:37] Is that right? Amen. The redeem is
[2:46:40] something
[2:46:42] to redeem anything
[2:46:44] is bring it back to its original.
[2:46:49] Hallelujah. Amen. So it's only the
[2:46:52] predestination
[2:46:54] that will be brought back
[2:46:58] others didn't come from there.
[2:47:02] Amen.
[2:47:05] The only the predestination
[2:47:08] will be brought back.
[2:47:10] These things which are happening here on
[2:47:12] earth
[2:47:14] are influenced by the battle in heaven.
[2:47:22] What we are now here
[2:47:26] depends on which side you were in
[2:47:28] heaven.
[2:47:32] Nothing will change.
[2:47:34] We will take the part we took there.
[2:47:42] Here on earth we find these people.
[2:47:47] One influence from below,
[2:47:50] one influence from above.
[2:47:53] One is a believer here
[2:47:56] because he believed God there.
[2:48:00] Another one is unbeliever here.
[2:48:03] Because he didn't believe God there.
[2:48:06] These people here, these two seas here,
[2:48:11] they come from different PLACES
[2:48:14] up or down.
[2:48:18] Amen.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; They come from different places
[2:48:21] and have relationship WITH
[2:48:25] or influence from
[2:48:28] from those places.
[2:48:31] Even now
[2:48:33] we are here
[2:48:36] influenced differently.
[2:48:42] We are influenced from where we are.
[2:48:50] We are influenced
[2:48:52] from where we are.
[2:48:54] I don't know whether they will flesh my
[2:48:56] picture if they can.
[2:48:59] But if let me read here
[2:49:02] It says here in this book
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; you see you we we are living or I shall
[2:49:08] read here we hear that one.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here I have often said
[2:49:13] I believe in the church here
[2:49:16] and each one is in this great
[2:49:20] conglomeration.
[2:49:22] This here there is a role here.
[2:49:27] In here
[2:49:29] lives mortal beings
[2:49:34] and each one
[2:49:36] in this great conglomeration
[2:49:40] of blackness and darkness.
[2:49:43] Mortals live here.
[2:49:47] They are either influenced from this way
[2:49:52] or from that way. In other either
[2:49:55] influence from above
[2:49:59] or from below but they living here on
[2:50:02] earth.
[2:50:04] We are living here on earth.
[2:50:07] Is influence from heaven
[2:50:10] or from under?
[2:50:13] You are influenced from somewhere.
[2:50:19] Whether you want to tell me or you don't
[2:50:20] want to tell me
[2:50:23] but you are influenced from somewhere
[2:50:28] I am telling you
[2:50:33] you cannot you cannot be here a spirit
[2:50:36] being
[2:50:38] sinner or saint
[2:50:40] without having any influence from
[2:50:42] underworld
[2:50:46] or from above wealth.
[2:50:48] If you are influenced from above,
[2:50:51] wealth,
[2:50:53] it means you are from there.
[2:50:56] It means you are there.
[2:50:59] Amen. If you It means your celestial
[2:51:02] body is there.
[2:51:06] He's waiting up there.
[2:51:09] Can you read
[2:51:11] a a a scripture, my brother? Matthew
[2:51:14] chapter 10 verse 8. I'm going to leave
[2:51:17] others.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18:10.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 verse 10.
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; What does he say there?
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; Take heed that ye despise not one of
[2:51:40] these little ones. For I say unto you
[2:51:43] that in heaven their angels do always
[2:51:46] behold the face of the father which is
[2:51:49] in heaven. They are angels.
[2:51:52] They are bodies. They are there. You are
[2:51:56] represented there.
[2:51:58] If you are the child of God, you are
[2:52:01] represented there. That is what it is
[2:52:03] saying here.
[2:52:05] If you are influenced from there,
[2:52:09] your celestial body, your angel
[2:52:13] is waiting for you there because your
[2:52:16] angel there is your body. Amen.
[2:52:21] But if you are influenced from below,
[2:52:26] but if you are wicked and hypo
[2:52:28] hypocritical,
[2:52:32] you are celeial body.
[2:52:34] is down there.
[2:52:37] In other words, you are living here
[2:52:39] but controlled from be.
[2:52:42] If you are the child of God, you are
[2:52:44] living here but you are controlled from
[2:52:46] above.
[2:52:48] You get influence from above. You are
[2:52:50] not getting influence FROM BELOW.
[2:52:53] THE LAW cannot influence you
[2:52:57] influence.
[2:53:00] Amen. The fruits you bear here,
[2:53:03] it proves where you come from.
[2:53:07] So you are here, what you are somewhere,
[2:53:11] your life that you live here, it's just
[2:53:14] a reflection.
[2:53:16] What your inheritance IS
[2:53:19] WHEN YOU live here. When you live here,
[2:53:23] you just go where you are.
[2:53:29] You don't go to you can't you can't you
[2:53:32] you don't go to a place where you are
[2:53:34] not there
