[1:21:02] amen this one is my son how are you
[1:21:06] son all right
[1:21:10] and I'll just say two
[1:21:15] words that the Bible
[1:21:18] says if perhaps some one of you
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:31] amen the Elders of the
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] church he has to go to the Elders of the
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:42] church then the matter becomes
[1:21:47] corrected
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:51] thank
[1:21:55] I've been struggling for that I've been
[1:21:58] struggling for
[1:22:00] that for this son of mine to see the
[1:22:07] elders well I don't know whether there
[1:22:09] was a shortage of f or
[1:22:14] what it was not
[1:22:17] moving I
[1:22:21] repeat
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:25] that is according to the
[1:22:32] Bible is it not like that brother
[1:22:37] yeah where all
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:43] Sinners but the
[1:22:46] blood we
[1:22:49] forgiven if
[1:22:51] you
[1:22:53] and you come back to
[1:22:55] God he
[1:23:00] forgives amen amen so this is what the
[1:23:03] brother
[1:23:05] did and
[1:23:09] then
[1:23:10] the
[1:23:12] elders treated him as a
[1:23:19] son and also the wife he has to
[1:23:27] I also regarded her as my
[1:23:32] daughter we were all
[1:23:36] forgiven of our sins and
[1:23:40] trespasses so that's why the Bible says
[1:23:43] we also should
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:48] forgive one
[1:23:50] another m
[1:23:53] now
[1:23:54] after he has seen the
[1:23:57] elders and
[1:24:01] brother reported back
[1:24:04] to and I was so
[1:24:06] glad at long
[1:24:09] last what I have asked
[1:24:12] for has been
[1:24:14] done for the Bible
[1:24:18] say one of
[1:24:21] you is found to be in the
[1:24:24] wrong he goes to the
[1:24:28] elders that they pray for him this is
[1:24:31] what they
[1:24:35] did that when they pray
[1:24:39] for then the Bible says he has been
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:46] forgiven so that's why I've
[1:24:50] been insisting
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:25:01] because I wanted
[1:25:04] him and his
[1:25:06] wife to be
[1:25:10] forgiven and car on in

[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:43:43] like that's why we as the children of
[1:43:46] God we don't want to see
[1:43:49] ourselves we want
[1:43:52] because he is our
[1:43:55] image that's why he said let us

[1:45:22] as he
[1:45:24] is and when I see him as he
[1:45:31] is then I

[1:45:36] like because he made me in his
[1:45:41] own you know he loved you so
[1:45:44] much until he made you in his
[1:45:49] own image amen isn't that
[1:45:55] love okay amen now I'll read few
[1:46:00] things and then before you think I'm
[1:46:04] preaching I would
[1:46:08] finish now the Bible
[1:46:10] says you know Sarah and Abraham
[1:46:15] abam the only man who has made who made
[1:46:25] was
[1:46:29] Abraham sorry for breaking off a bit I
[1:46:33] think it's not yet
[1:46:38] winter now there's hot air cominging me
[1:46:45] here all right
[1:46:48] amen winter is still still
[1:46:52] coming and we will prepare prepare for
[1:46:59] it now I will read a bit
[1:47:05] here
[1:47:08] um last week or was it last
[1:47:13] week all this time we're talking about
[1:47:16] the prophet of God was talking about the
[1:47:19] angel of the Lord the angel of
[1:47:25] the the prophet has been talking about
[1:47:30] that but at the
[1:47:32] end he ended with the notable
[1:47:41] one because at the
[1:47:43] end we too should see the notable
[1:47:49] one
[1:47:51] you end up with the notable
[1:47:58] one amen
[1:48:00] amen now I I read this
[1:48:03] part uh it was at the end of
[1:48:08] their towards the end of their
[1:48:15] journey
[1:48:16] and the Lord
[1:48:19] said
[1:48:21] I will certainly unto
[1:48:25] thee said unto
[1:48:27] Abraham Abraham was a man who could walk
[1:48:32] with
[1:48:35] God he was in contact with
[1:48:40] God amen amen amen God to him was the
[1:48:45] notable
[1:48:49] one
[1:48:51] and in his
[1:48:53] journey it was
[1:48:55] God who took
[1:48:58] him to the
[1:49:02] landing we are still coming to
[1:49:05] that the city is like a
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:11] pyramid and that's why
[1:49:15] before we he could sumon
[1:49:19] us
[1:49:22] he had to put us in the
[1:49:29] P where you find the white
[1:49:35] stone in the pyramid we still come
[1:49:40] there because it is for the
[1:49:47] citizens now the gospel I will tell you
[1:49:51] something in the Bible the Lord Jesus
[1:49:55] spoke about the
[1:49:57] people
[1:50:00] uh that is 17 John
[1:50:07] 17 if you are a
[1:50:10] pastor and there's a
[1:50:14] congregation these are the people God
[1:50:16] has given
[1:50:19] you
[1:50:24] is that
[1:50:27] so that's
[1:50:29] why uh when a pastor brings his
[1:50:35] message it is not in fear that the
[1:50:38] people will
[1:50:41] live because he's talking to those God
[1:50:45] has
[1:50:49] given
[1:50:51] amen now if God has some
[1:50:55] people and he gives to a
[1:50:59] pastor
[1:51:02] a
[1:51:03] amen he will
[1:51:05] F make sure
[1:51:07] that the Sheep is very well known to the
[1:51:15] shepherd and the
[1:51:17] sheer so Jesus says
[1:51:20] my
[1:51:27] Sheep amen
[1:51:29] amen that's why a
[1:51:32] shf do not fear
[1:51:35] that uh there can be an
[1:51:39] infiltration of the strange
[1:51:48] sheep amen amen why
[1:51:53] because it is God who
[1:51:57] provides now I am preaching to the
[1:52:01] people whom God has given
[1:52:05] [Applause]
[1:52:09] me it makes me
[1:52:14] so
[1:52:16] because H they are with me
[1:52:20] they are the message of of this
[1:52:25] time amen am preaching to
[1:52:28] you is saying to you you are
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:36] this amen amen now if I come with the
[1:52:43] message the
[1:52:44] message that
[1:52:46] is actually revealing you
[1:52:53] would you go
[1:52:56] away you want to come to
[1:53:00] where you are being
[1:53:08] presented and it's
[1:53:11] your I'm your image you are my
[1:53:18] IM when I come here I come here
[1:53:22] because I don't come say I'm going to
[1:53:26] preach they want to tell
[1:53:30] them I I go to him first because Moses
[1:53:34] said to God these people are not my
[1:53:40] people when God said Moses they should
[1:53:45] leave that
[1:53:47] place and Moses said I won't leave here
[1:53:52] unless your
[1:53:55] presence goes with
[1:53:57] us because he said because these people
[1:54:02] are not
[1:54:04] my they
[1:54:08] are I will only leave this
[1:54:11] place
[1:54:14] if if
[1:54:16] you take your position
[1:54:21] and me I'm just a
[1:54:25] Shepherd but the people are
[1:54:31] yours you know that's
[1:54:34] why a Good
[1:54:39] Shepherd will always make sure
[1:54:43] that the Sheep he
[1:54:47] shephers are not his
[1:54:50] they are of
[1:54:55] God that's
[1:54:58] why I went to bed bed
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:04] late and
[1:55:08] because dealing coming to
[1:55:12] preach I do it the Moses
[1:55:15] way Moses
[1:55:18] way saying
[1:55:20] the people I'm going to
[1:55:22] preach are not mine they are
[1:55:30] your you know in my the heart of a real
[1:55:35] Shepherd it's for God to take care of
[1:55:40] you and for to heal
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:46] you that's in the heart of yeah a
[1:55:49] shepherd
[1:55:51] a true
[1:55:53] shepher amen amen believe like I
[1:56:00] believe okay now let's read something
[1:56:03] here
[1:56:06] before we break not break
[1:56:10] amen okay I'm looking for something
[1:56:16] here uh you know they say in the days of
[1:56:20] the but in the
[1:56:23] days of
[1:56:28] the in those
[1:56:31] days and the days are passing
[1:56:36] by so much that I was looking in the
[1:56:41] scripture I realized Luke chapter
[1:56:46] 17 it says as it was in the days
[1:56:54] of in the days of
[1:56:59] brother Noah yes
[1:57:04] amen okay
[1:57:06] amen you'll realize
[1:57:09] that there was two
[1:57:12] things referring to the end time
[1:57:18] side you have the
[1:57:22] days and you have the days
[1:57:26] of two
[1:57:29] days now in the days of
[1:57:34] lot it was
[1:57:38] fire in the days of
[1:57:44] Lord it
[1:57:46] was water amen
[1:57:50] hasn't it happened the same
[1:57:53] way when he was asked about his
[1:57:58] coming he referred to these
[1:58:01] scriptures as it
[1:58:03] was in the days of
[1:58:06] Lord as it was in the days of
[1:58:11] no so we
[1:58:14] have
[1:58:16] both happened today
[1:58:20] it started with
[1:58:23] fire let me talk to the
[1:58:27] people this people it started with
[1:58:33] fire every day we were told about fire
[1:58:43] C and the
[1:58:45] match about
[1:58:48] California
[1:58:50] and there's a reason
[1:58:56] why all right there's a reason why there
[1:59:01] are some places the prophet of God not
[1:59:09] visit he will just
[1:59:12] say I preach once at a certain
[1:59:17] place but not return to that
[1:59:25] place I I asked some
[1:59:30] brothers
[1:59:32] and they can't answer that question and
[1:59:36] I
[1:59:37] said you see in this
[1:59:40] world
[1:59:43] everywhere what do you
[1:59:47] see terrible
[1:59:52] floods and
[1:59:55] earthquakes and what
[1:59:58] else LS come LS L
[2:00:03] lights lens
[2:00:06] lightss are happening
[2:00:12] daily but don't you wonder that it is
[2:00:18] happening but I'm
[2:00:22] residing and I've never
[2:00:25] seen one of
[2:00:29] suching where I
[2:00:34] am haven't you ask
[2:00:38] you that
[2:00:40] question I've seen them
[2:00:47] happen amen amen
[2:00:49] but I haven't seen
[2:00:52] it happening where I
[2:00:56] am if you go to the Bible things would
[2:01:00] happen but not where Abraham
[2:01:03] [Applause]
[2:01:07] was
[2:01:11] Hallelujah
[2:01:13] Abraham God would just tell
[2:01:16] him showed him things
[2:01:21] as we have read in the
[2:01:23] scripture that lot
[2:01:28] chose the sight of
[2:01:32] Sodom because it
[2:01:36] looked it looked
[2:01:42] what
[2:01:48] amen
[2:01:50] and
[2:01:51] Abraham now that's why the Bible
[2:01:55] says
[2:01:57] Lord went
[2:02:00] there
[2:02:01] before before
[2:02:07] what okay
[2:02:09] amen now I let me read
[2:02:14] this the days of
[2:02:17] Lord was fire
[2:02:22] the days of
[2:02:23] Noah was
[2:02:26] water and the Lord mentioned
[2:02:31] both as it was in the days of
[2:02:35] Lord he said again as it was in the days
[2:02:40] of so shall it
[2:02:43] be and it happened exactly like that
[2:02:52] to those who has had
[2:02:57] him when he
[2:02:59] spoke that this is what the
[2:03:02] Lord
[2:03:05] spoken all right
[2:03:07] amen can you see the
[2:03:11] sence the days of
[2:03:14] Lord I've seen them and have passed the
[2:03:19] dayses of
[2:03:20] Noah still
[2:03:23] carrying
[2:03:26] water all right amen now before we
[2:03:32] close
[2:03:34] H now it is
[2:03:37] only
[2:03:40] Abraham who knew about the days of
[2:03:45] Lord and his own days
[2:03:50] the days of

[2:38:28] not let's close to come back to those
[2:38:33] things
[2:38:35] on because you know I left a page here I
[2:38:39] don't know I'll bring that
[2:38:41] page where it speaks
[2:38:44] of
[2:38:46] uh you know he
[2:38:48] [Music]
[2:38:56] was
[2:38:58] a representative no no no mediator a
[2:39:03] mediator
[2:39:04] amen we'll come to
[2:39:07] that because it says
[2:39:13] when today when the seven
[2:39:17] seal is open he is no
[2:39:21] longer
[2:39:27] immedi I'm glad God would allow me to
[2:39:30] read it
[2:39:33] now because we are coming to
[2:39:37] that show what that's why the ministry
[2:39:42] is just Angel
[2:39:44] angels
[2:39:48] because a
[2:39:50] mediator is a
[2:39:54] mediator I'll show you
[2:39:56] something listen I won't read now
[2:39:59] but you
[2:40:02] haven't understand
[2:40:04] this the lamb took the book from
[2:40:12] within then from there you
[2:40:16] understand because it says and here he
[2:40:20] is he was imediator on the
[2:40:26] Altar for the
[2:40:29] people just a little
[2:40:32] longer then he says but now he comes
[2:40:38] from here from The
[2:40:40] Altar and the last
[2:40:43] seal he is no more
[2:40:46] a
[2:40:50] mediator that's why as a
[2:40:54] mediator that's why where where
[2:40:56] somewhere he says the took the book
[2:41:00] within
[2:41:03] himself we look at that and even the day
[2:41:07] of
[2:41:09] redemption did you know when is the
[2:41:13] day do you know that
[2:41:16] when is
[2:41:22] the you don't know when the book is open
[2:41:27] when the book is
[2:41:29] open the day of
[2:41:33] redemption the day the
[2:41:38] book now which book because you have the
[2:41:43] Lamb's Book of
[2:41:44] Life book of
[2:41:48] life now the day the
[2:41:51] book is
[2:41:54] open that is the day
[2:41:58] of redemption
[2:42:00] amen
[2:42:02] meaning this ministry now is only to the
[2:42:11] redeemed if the book was
[2:42:14] open meaning the message is for the
[2:42:20] redeemed now the
[2:42:23] redeemed what is
[2:42:25] redemption it
[2:42:28] introduced those who were there for the
[2:42:31] foundation of the
[2:42:33] world now when they are
[2:42:36] redeemed meaning that they are back
[2:42:39] where they
[2:42:43] were Al are still
[2:42:47] here are still in this bodies of
[2:42:51] Flesh
[2:42:54] inside is a redeemed
[2:42:58] person this redeemed
[2:43:00] person you will see the nature divine
[2:43:05] nature that is with this man or
[2:43:08] woman not being
[2:43:11] about
[2:43:14] the
[2:43:16] redeemed redeemed is to take
[2:43:19] back where it
[2:43:27] was that's why a person can
[2:43:31] come collect some
[2:43:36] quotes and
[2:43:39] go amen
[2:43:44] amen all right amen and one can
[2:43:50] come then later he
