[46:40] somewhere expecting to get a
[46:43] feedback so when most of the time I'm
[46:46] not around
[46:48] here know that I'll be out
[46:51] there assisting the children of
[46:54] God I took some trip with some
[46:59] brothers start
[47:01] witho I was with
[47:08] brother because the Pastor said we must
[47:10] go and assist this
[47:13] side the pastor that side by the name of
[47:16] Pastor
[47:22] M SP to our pastor to come and minister
[47:25] in his church
[47:26] [Music]
[47:28] the Pastor said we must go and
[47:31] assist they had some
[47:33] questions so we answered through the the
[47:39] seron it was on a Saturday
[47:42] afternoon Sunday
[47:44] morning requested us to to tell them
[47:47] about the true
[47:49] baptism we did so after service we
[47:54] baptized 11 Souls
[47:58] the
[47:59] are so I've had I was talking to T this
[48:03] week
[48:04] again he said we must come
[48:08] again so be with us in prayer as will be
[48:12] visiting them
[48:14] again amen amen so the previous week we
[48:18] were invited again in the cville
[48:21] area and then we preach the word of God
[48:25] Seven
[48:26] Souls responded positively to the
[48:29] weight so we are going to baptize
[48:33] them so the previous week we were in
[48:38] L God was with us on the way if you go
[48:43] to an area you just see when you are
[48:46] going on the
[48:48] way whether it's a blessed Journey or
[48:51] not because when we arrive at the border
[48:55] you know there was a lot of C because
[48:57] it's a new
[49:00] year when we crossed the South African
[49:05] border being on the
[49:07] que police from on the other side they
[49:12] pull out my
[49:14] car and then I thought maybe they want
[49:16] to
[49:17] search only to find that they are giving
[49:21] me another you know
[49:24] entrance the VIP amen then I thought
[49:29] maybe the the others will
[49:32] follow and then they stop the other cars
[49:35] but allow me to
[49:37] enter I said that means this journey is
[49:42] blessed so we arrive safely in the
[49:45] area and then we preach the
[49:48] word on we we ared Saturday Sunday and
[49:54] Monday God blessed us with 11 Souls once
[50:00] small that joined the army of
[50:04] God so one thing that surprised
[50:08] me as our brother was baptizing two kids
[50:14] girls between the age of 10 and 12
[50:17] somewhere
[50:18] there you know when you look at a child
[50:22] you think this one need not to be
[50:24] baptized
[50:27] because he's still
[50:28] young so one of the sisters said no but
[50:31] you will get baptized next time for
[50:33] today
[50:37] wait then those two
[50:40] girls said no when coming to the word of
[50:42] God there's no child or
[50:45] elderly and they were God
[50:49] baptized while we are still surprised
[50:52] that was Sunday Monday after after the
[50:57] service their mom and their elder
[51:01] sister God
[51:03] baptized so the other the entire
[51:08] family

[1:11:24] door was opened in heaven and the first
[1:11:27] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[1:11:29] trumpet talking with me which say come
[1:11:32] up hether and I will show thee things
[1:11:35] which must be Hereafter and immediately
[1:11:38] I was in the spirit and behold a throne
[1:11:40] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:11:45] throne Revelation chapter 21 from verse
[1:11:50] 9 to
[1:11:52] 11
[1:11:55] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[1:11:57] Angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:12:00] the seven last plagues and talked with
[1:12:03] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[1:12:06] the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried
[1:12:09] me away in the spirit to a great and
[1:12:12] high mountain and showed me that great
[1:12:15] City the holy Jerusalem descending Out
[1:12:18] of Heaven from God having the glory of
[1:12:21] God and her light was like unto the the
[1:12:23] stone most precious even like a jasper
[1:12:26] stone clear and
[1:12:29] Crystal amen amen you may be
[1:12:38] seated and
[1:12:40] uh
[1:12:43] finally
[1:12:45] oh let's read the thir one re
[1:12:50] Revelation 8 verse1
[1:12:54] Revelation 8 verse 1
[1:12:58] amen and when he had opened the seventh
[1:13:01] seal there was silence in heaven about
[1:13:04] the space of half an
[1:13:07] hour yes sir
[1:13:11] amen uh you can take your seats
[1:13:19] now thanks for the song this
[1:13:22] morning
[1:13:25] amen amen it's for
[1:13:28] the uh what do you call
[1:13:32] them the the Seed of
[1:13:37] Abraham are you saying the Seed of
[1:13:39] Abraham yeah the Seed of Abraham Abraham
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:45] so I see people are coming
[1:13:49] in getting
[1:13:52] baptized all this
[1:13:56] amen uh my brother
[1:14:02] here that
[1:14:06] brother call his name but we know he
[1:14:10] might just call him my friend and so
[1:14:13] forth oh
[1:14:15] amen yeah the brother knows about you
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:20] brother yeah yes brother brother
[1:14:29] yeah amen
[1:14:32] so he he said something
[1:14:36] striking talking
[1:14:39] about you know
[1:14:41] Abraham
[1:14:44] Abraham and the Seed of
[1:14:49] Abraham okay amen now if you look
[1:14:58] spiritually you
[1:14:59] see each and
[1:15:03] everyone of those
[1:15:07] Sons they had
[1:15:12] SE
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:16] meaning the real
[1:15:21] Believers if it's a messenger let's say
[1:15:25] it's
[1:15:27] Abraham the real
[1:15:32] Believers at that
[1:15:35] time was the
[1:15:37] Seed of
[1:15:40] Abraham so the
[1:15:43] ministry can be the
[1:15:46] ministry is of the
[1:15:51] seed come from the Throne of
[1:15:57] God and that's why in the
[1:16:01] Bible the only man who met M was
[1:16:10] Abraham now some
[1:16:14] people because of they are trying to
[1:16:20] separate from God
[1:16:24] MCC was
[1:16:28] God but only when he met
[1:16:32] abah he
[1:16:37] was when he
[1:16:39] saves when he saved the people he was
[1:16:45] Jesus amen amen
[1:16:49] amen when he took the book
[1:16:55] he was
[1:16:59] the am but the same
[1:17:03] person you know he took the book from
[1:17:06] the one that set on the
[1:17:10] throne
[1:17:13] and then when I read maybe today you
[1:17:17] will understand
[1:17:19] it it says he took the book from within
[1:17:27] himself the book couldn't be somewhere
[1:17:32] else because it is the
[1:17:36] Lamb that shed
[1:17:40] blood and now when we thank God for the
[1:17:44] seventh angel
[1:17:48] message he took the book from within
[1:17:52] himself
[1:17:55] because the first
[1:17:57] Throne it is from the one that set on
[1:17:59] the
[1:18:00] throne the Bible says so but then the

[1:18:05] Throne was in heaven the second Throne
[1:18:10] was in Jesus the
[1:18:12] thirone in a

[1:28:20] went where
[1:28:26] the reason it is
[1:28:29] west it is
[1:28:31] because
[1:28:34] a man was placed

[1:28:43] time he meets an angel
[1:28:47] or he's going to meet an

[1:29:00] from this
[1:29:03] position man was placed
[1:29:08] East but every time he tells you I had
[1:29:12] to go
[1:29:14] west to meet the Angel's
[1:29:19] message and to come back again
[1:29:24] amen amen that's why it's a
[1:29:27] message from the

[1:29:59] position he said come
[1:30:03] up
[1:30:06] here then I will show
[1:30:11] you all right amen that
[1:30:15] means come up from the church
[1:30:20] ages

[1:30:50] churches one breaking from this
[1:30:54] world they also say the Bride of the
[1:30:58] bride of
[1:31:00] Christ say so another one breaks from
[1:31:05] there he also becomes the
[1:31:08] bread also all of them are saying the
[1:31:12] prophet said Prophet
[1:31:16] said but actually we want to hear from
[1:31:20] the bride

[1:32:09] sister take note of
[1:32:11] this I'm not talking to you about the
[1:32:18] brides I'm talking about the bride
[1:32:24] amen now the bride has a brid
[1:32:32] gr now you must listen to me
[1:32:35] that when I talk about the

[1:32:44] news and when I talk about the
[1:32:48] bride it's something very special
[1:32:57] uh did you hear
[1:33:00] here if you want
[1:33:03] to talk to some you to receive it from

[1:34:26] church there's so many things coming to
[1:34:29] the
[1:34:31] church separations and all
[1:34:35] that but from to the
[1:34:39] Bri she she will only
[1:34:43] receive letters from the
[1:34:49] groom you see the difference
[1:34:56] If the message is not from the
[1:35:02] groom so it is not to the
[1:35:06] Bride Can to a church not to the bride
[1:35:11] for the bride message should come from
[1:35:14] the
[1:35:18] groom all right now we will read this
[1:35:22] quickly
[1:35:23] here now if you look at another
[1:35:28] part uh because finally out of the
[1:35:32] church
[1:35:34] ages a messenger was called
[1:35:38] up after the church
[1:35:42] ages you know God keeps his time with
[1:35:46] his
[1:35:48] people after the church ages
[1:35:52] a messenger was called
[1:35:56] up things don't that just
[1:36:00] happen no
[1:36:03] somebody must
[1:36:08] beon to
[1:36:11] receive with the message for the next
[1:36:15] time now come after the seven Church
[1:36:20] ages I will show you
[1:36:23] things to
[1:36:26] come to
[1:36:28] come the
[1:36:32] Bri okay am then again it
[1:36:36] says come
[1:36:39] up
[1:36:42] here and show and it says come up I'll
[1:36:48] show you the continue with this come up
[1:36:55] yeah meaning you break
[1:36:59] forth to a
[1:37:04] place now a
[1:37:06] messenger if God says come
[1:37:14] up meaning that
[1:37:20] message
[1:37:22] to come to the
[1:37:29] place for the
[1:37:32] message it is like this why there should
[1:37:36] be some
[1:37:39] meetings
[1:37:41] meaning every
[1:37:43] meeting should be a
[1:37:46] special be
[1:37:50] special
[1:37:54] he takes me from here put me here and
[1:37:58] takes me from here and put me
[1:38:02] higher every service should be a special
[1:38:09] service
[1:38:10] otherwise we become church
[1:38:18] goers if you go attend a
[1:38:23] service you come
[1:38:26] up you'd have gained
[1:38:32] something otherwise you are
[1:38:39] only the message of God it
[1:38:45] was if they are led by
[1:38:50] Moses
[1:38:52] uh they were
[1:38:56] shifting today they are
[1:39:01] here that is the real
[1:39:03] message
[1:39:05] taking takes you from here
[1:39:08] and you
[1:39:13] from otherwise you become the same
[1:39:19] person a church go
[1:39:21] is the same person he doesn't change he
[1:39:25] doesn't go to the
[1:39:27] service because maybe he has taken a
[1:39:32] step
[1:39:33] forward he comes the same way he came
[1:39:38] last and out the same
[1:39:41] way amen but the real
[1:39:45] message was today they are
[1:39:48] here tomorrow they are here

[1:40:15] morning now before we close I I realized
[1:40:19] it that the message it's not
[1:40:27] stationary
[1:40:31] so actually the
[1:40:35] message was not for to create
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:42] churches the the message was sent to
[1:40:46] shape out the
[1:40:49] bride

[1:40:55] can't belong to a

[1:51:20] I'm I was looking at something
[1:51:24] here you look at the time we are living
[1:51:29] in when
[1:51:32] H when the prophet in this uh what you
[1:51:38] call it now is it not a dream what is it
[1:51:41] yes it's a dream no vision
[1:51:48] vision a mountain was chopped on top by
[1:51:53] the prophet according to the
[1:51:59] vision now before
[1:52:02] the the pyramid message was
[1:52:08] pre and he said the one who spoke to
[1:52:13] brother about the
[1:52:18] M beneath
[1:52:21] that was a white
[1:52:28] stone okay this
[1:52:31] is uh page 15 of is this the
[1:52:39] time this the time time to do
[1:52:45] what now he says beneath when when when
[1:52:52] that that mountain top was
[1:52:58] chopped beneath that was White
[1:53:03] Stone
[1:53:06] Granite and he says
[1:53:09] you prophet of
[1:53:13] God and
[1:53:15] uh and and you said the son
[1:53:20] or light has never shine on this
[1:53:28] before okay amen
[1:53:31] and I qu
[1:53:35] here now that
[1:53:38] light light had never come upon that
[1:53:48] stone meaning
[1:53:50] it was never
[1:53:57] revealed like this stone called to the
[1:53:59] seventh
[1:54:04] SE people are saying it's not
[1:54:09] revealed it's not revealed you will come
[1:54:12] next
[1:54:13] year is not
[1:54:15] revealed you will come here after next
[1:54:18] year
[1:54:20] it is
[1:54:21] not
[1:54:23] revealed amen amen until
[1:54:29] when but let us read
[1:54:32] here then it says light has never come
[1:54:36] upon that
[1:54:41] stone it is
[1:54:43] white but light has never come upon
[1:54:48] you
[1:54:52] now the
[1:54:55] messenger was expecting light upon the
[1:55:04] stone the color white was not perfection
[1:55:08] without
[1:55:13] light
[1:55:15] amen if you hear the word of God
[1:55:21] the word of God should be light to
[1:55:27] you now we have the spoken word
[1:55:29] everything
[1:55:31] here but we were waiting for
[1:55:38] light but before Light Came
[1:55:43] Upon the message that was preached to
[1:55:48] us we only
[1:55:53] scripturally until The Light Came Upon
[1:55:59] it let me read this a
[1:56:03] bit now he
[1:56:05] said look upon
[1:56:10] this light has never come upon it
[1:56:16] before you know you've been here maybe
[1:56:25] worship but has light already come upon
[1:56:30] what you have believed all this
[1:56:39] time or you just
[1:56:42] believe
[1:56:46] it that the way say so
[1:56:51] but has it find it its
[1:56:55] place the place of the way is not in
[1:56:59] your
[1:57:01] head am it should be on the
[1:57:06] throne the
[1:57:09] soul that's where the message
[1:57:12] is the message come to the
[1:57:17] Head amen now because of that that's why
[1:57:21] we have so many
[1:57:25] churches but God has got no many
[1:57:29] churches there has only
[1:57:31] one but men has
[1:57:37] many because if it is it comes to that
[1:57:42] mind then it goes it comes to that
[1:57:46] mind it becomes
[1:57:53] theology but the
[1:57:55] throne talking about The
[1:57:58] Throne as he says the first Throne was
[1:58:01] in
[1:58:02] heaven
[1:58:05] second in Christ Jesus
[1:58:11] the3 if it is not from the
[1:58:14] throne then it is from
[1:58:18] Men
[1:58:20] and what's coming from the
[1:58:24] man has no
[1:58:29] power it should be from the
[1:58:33] throne you remember that story
[1:58:37] of uh what was that princess now
[1:58:42] Diana Princess Diana we picked up when
[1:58:47] after the people were talking about
[1:58:49] about it the
[1:58:54] reporters then
[1:58:57] finally there came
[1:59:00] news
[1:59:02] saying now this is
[1:59:04] news from the Insiders the
[1:59:11] Insiders then when I looked at
[1:59:14] that I said now this is something
[1:59:17] else we've been
[1:59:20] reading who's been coming through
[1:59:24] television about his head death but now
[1:59:29] this one says this is now from the
[1:59:37] inside
[1:59:39] then I T
[1:59:43] now wanting to hear from the
[1:59:48] inside
[1:59:50] because the
[1:59:54] outsiders they can only
[1:59:58] write rumor they
[2:00:04] have now when I heard of the
[2:00:07] insid I put aside all the
[2:00:13] rum
[2:00:18] newspapers then I now concentrated on
[2:00:21] the
[2:00:24] Insiders let me now hear the
[2:00:28] Insiders you know even in the message
[2:00:32] you need to hear from
[2:00:36] the
[2:00:38] amen everybody's got
[2:00:42] spoken but you must look for the
[2:00:48] inside
[2:00:50] inside
[2:00:51] meaning now the
[2:00:55] family the
[2:00:57] Insiders the real news now coming from
[2:01:01] the
[2:01:04] Insiders that's
[2:01:07] why an
[2:01:10] outsider will never come with a perfect
[2:01:15] M because some of the things he
[2:01:18] says I hear I think they
[2:01:22] say but
[2:01:25] inside as it
[2:01:31] is that's
[2:01:33] why we should
[2:01:36] belong you should
[2:01:38] be the
[2:01:42] Insiders as an
[2:01:45] insid you take
[2:01:47] it from
[2:01:50] the
[2:01:54] inside if you say something
[2:01:58] here and uh if it
[2:02:01] goes and leaves the original
[2:02:06] place it will start to
[2:02:09] change it is no
[2:02:11] longer as it
[2:02:15] was amen amen now I thank God
[2:02:21] today that we are receiving the
[2:02:25] message from the
[2:02:31] inside uhhuh
[2:02:34] amen if you say what of the
[2:02:43] time inside I will
[2:02:45] say
[2:02:47] 12:00 12:00
[2:02:50] then you ask an
[2:02:52] outside what of the
[2:02:54] time you see
[2:02:57] as you are asking the
[2:03:02] people that that time changes from this
[2:03:09] to that's like the seventh
[2:03:12] seal it has
[2:03:16] changed many a Time
[2:03:21] until they just say it is the seventh
[2:03:28] SE that's
[2:03:34] all I
[2:03:36] read to
[2:03:39] close
[2:03:42] and he says
[2:03:44] here after
[2:03:47] that it's talking of the
[2:03:51] pyramid but the inside of
[2:03:56] the of the pyramid amen
[2:04:00] because it
[2:04:03] says
[2:04:05] never the light has never
[2:04:08] shine on
[2:04:11] that white
[2:04:14] stone in
[2:04:15] there where was the White Stone
[2:04:21] okay then he carries on to say now he
[2:04:26] said look upon
[2:04:29] this light has never come upon this
[2:04:36] before it can be the seventh seal you
[2:04:40] read about
[2:04:42] it
[2:04:45] but light has never yet come out
[2:04:50] upon now one will say it is revealed
[2:04:56] raled M amen it is
[2:05:00] revealed okay amen let's
[2:05:05] read then he
[2:05:08] says while the people were
[2:05:13] looking because the people
[2:05:16] come when all them got up
[2:05:20] I told them to
[2:05:22] watch and all of them came up to look
[2:05:31] in right
[2:05:33] amen
[2:05:36] because when if you want to look at the
[2:05:40] message You' got to look
[2:05:47] where
[2:05:49] now they came to look ins
[2:05:54] inside I
[2:05:56] read and while they were
[2:06:01] looking he looked out of the corner of
[2:06:04] the
[2:06:06] eye and watch me I slep
[2:06:12] off to one side and started going
[2:06:17] towards the w
[2:06:22] then going towards the
[2:06:26] West uh the sitting of the
[2:06:30] sun come up a hill coming up the hill
[2:06:36] going down the
[2:06:40] hill getting
[2:06:45] smaller you get what I mean amen

[2:06:51] people that were
[2:06:54] watching they saw him getting
[2:06:59] smaller
[2:07:01] smaller he said
[2:07:03] then the Brethren turn
[2:07:07] around after a while and
[2:07:10] said did he
[2:07:15] vanish where did he asking about
[2:07:19] the prophet the
[2:07:23] prophet and he
[2:07:26] said some took that
[2:07:31] way some took that
[2:07:36] way some another
[2:07:39] way but a very
[2:07:43] few stay and look onto what I had told
[2:07:47] them
[2:07:55] that's
[2:07:59] why no marriage on Sunday he told
[2:08:05] you tell
[2:08:07] you he
[2:08:10] did there's no
[2:08:16] amen did the prophet

[2:08:23] us that
[2:08:25] Sunday is the
[2:08:35] resurrection all
[2:08:37] right you see now in the
[2:08:44] process the message started to de
[2:08:49] not the
[2:08:51] message no the the vision of the
[2:08:57] people okay amen you know if there can
[2:09:01] be light
[2:09:04] here or God can send us
[2:09:08] light and that light will started to
[2:09:12] grow bigger and bigger
[2:09:16] and then the people will start to get
[2:09:24] blinded amen
[2:09:26] amen even if one if talking about

[2:10:12] few they started
[2:10:15] together looking at that
[2:10:19] inside White
[2:10:22] Stone but there was nothing written on
[2:10:27] it as a
[2:10:30] result some people looked at it
[2:10:37] naturally if there's nothing written on
[2:10:41] you can open your eyes
[2:10:43] wi but still it won help because there's
[2:10:47] nothing written on
[2:10:49] but the
[2:10:50] others they saw
[2:10:54] something of which if you come to
[2:10:58] church one comes and
[2:11:01] listening and another one is receiving
[2:11:07] it in
[2:11:12] hisory that
[2:11:14] means for the other one it came for him
[2:11:19] when God comes to you he comes to your
[2:11:27] heart you know God don't put his way
[2:11:30] there and say
[2:11:35] guess no what it
[2:11:40] means no he doesn't do that like they
[2:11:45] they did with the seventh SE
[2:11:49] God never said this is the seven
[2:11:53] se you people you guess
[2:11:58] what no if it is the way to the
[2:12:04] bride it will come
[2:12:06] straight to their
[2:12:11] heart amen that's right amen
[2:12:16] amen if it is to the
[2:12:19] bride then the wait from the
[2:12:23] bridegroom comes to the
[2:12:28] soul amen
[2:12:30] amen because it doesn't come to the
[2:12:35] head to a worldly man it will come to
[2:12:39] the head but to the
[2:12:45] bride
[2:12:47] amen
[2:12:52] can I close right no now now now that
[2:12:57] that's why even
[2:12:58] today it is like
[2:13:02] this we'll still come
[2:13:05] to pick up some things
[2:13:09] here even this
[2:13:12] flying
[2:13:15] interpretation of that white stone
[2:13:22] that's why now we're looking at the the
[2:13:26] Angels
[2:13:28] here flying
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:33] interpretation all right amen I'm
[2:13:36] talking about the angels with a capital
[2:13:44] A amen all right let's close with this
[2:13:49] now it says here it says is this the
[2:13:57] time looking
[2:14:00] inside some took that
[2:14:04] way some took
[2:14:10] that now but still talking about
[2:14:16] it but
[2:14:18] going that
[2:14:22] way you find him this
[2:14:25] year saying it is not R you come 10
[2:14:30] years
[2:14:31] after still saying it's
[2:14:36] not the word of God don't come like
[2:14:40] that
[2:14:41] listen some took that
[2:14:45] way some took that way
[2:14:50] the reason
[2:14:51] being they look
[2:14:55] in and there there was no
[2:15:01] writing the seven seal there's no
[2:15:04] writing
[2:15:07] there amen but it
[2:15:11] was
[2:15:13] opened
[2:15:16] open
[2:15:19] all
[2:15:21] right if it is
[2:15:24] opened something that is
[2:15:28] closed you don't
[2:15:33] see then but it
[2:15:35] was
[2:15:38] open and when it was
[2:15:41] opened there was
[2:15:43] what a white
[2:15:46] stone a white stone
[2:15:52] still nothing
[2:16:01] written if you you listen to the
[2:16:05] word it said we were in his
[2:16:16] mind do you believe that you were
[2:16:23] there now if we were in his
[2:16:27] mind
[2:16:29] before the foundation of the
[2:16:33] world then when he started to create
[2:16:37] things we were in
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:42] him yes that's
[2:16:45] why he says even the seventh
[2:16:49] seal was spoken
[2:16:52] of from
[2:16:57] Genesis you see
[2:16:59] amen from the beginning it was
[2:17:04] spoken the
[2:17:06] seven
[2:17:08] seal all right now tell
[2:17:12] me when is it going to be
[2:17:16] revealed
[2:17:18] it is revealed any
[2:17:20] date it is revealed sorry it is revealed
[2:17:25] already yeah to you yes
[2:17:30] [Applause]
[2:17:31] Amen to
[2:17:34] some not now those who
[2:17:39] were
[2:17:41] H looking looking
[2:17:45] inside one started to go that way the
[2:17:49] other one that way the other one that
[2:17:55] way all
[2:17:57] coming from that
[2:18:02] place then it remained like
[2:18:06] that that's why even
[2:18:08] today it is just like
[2:18:14] that amen
[2:18:16] amen
[2:18:18] and if it is not
[2:18:22] open you
[2:18:25] remain still
[2:18:30] looking and you see
[2:18:34] nothing if it is not
[2:18:39] revealed then you end
[2:18:43] up leaving the the
[2:18:46] message
[2:18:49] we are not talking about leaving a
[2:18:54] classroom or a chur
[2:18:56] building no that is not the
[2:19:02] message if you start off from here say I
[2:19:07] don't believe what you
[2:19:11] preach and you walk
[2:19:13] away you'll end up joining something
[2:19:16] else
[2:19:21] but which is not the
[2:19:24] answer
[2:19:26] question you still remain without
[2:19:30] anything and you
[2:19:33] enjoy to go
[2:19:35] where it is not
[2:19:41] preached amen amen but the bride of
[2:19:45] Christ wants to come
[2:19:48] to where the the
[2:19:54] husband amen amen say things that no
[2:19:59] other

[2:23:59] was
[2:24:03] manifested you know a true
