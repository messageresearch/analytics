TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] And brother was there seen the man there. Amen. And he said, "You see Dborah was a judge. The Bible said and I said, "Pastor, we are talking about pastorship. Show me in the Bible. so that I can also ordain some sisters for that position. said, "Yeah, you know, Hannah came to the temple. When the child was born that that was Hana the prophet is there, she appeared only there. You've never heard of Hana. Show me the scripture." Amen. H the Samaritan woman, she also went into the village. Yeah. She said to the people, "Come and see." She was never ordained. Show me in the Bible where they ordained a a sister. Nowhere. In fact, the Lord Jesus was supposed to have female apostles. Apostle Mary Magdalene, apostles also. Amen. Now after that they left they went to to whatever then later in the evening this pastor phone the pastor who brought me who brought him to me said yeah now I have seen I I I mean I have seen the truth now about this brand of mines He says firstly, if you are going to continue with the the gospel, [Music] the people will leave you. Now I said, brother, bring him to the tabernacle. He he should say to you, the people will will leave you. You'll remain alone. like amen. So he has missed the point. Then he says h I've seen on this internet they they say bren this brenham he started well this brenham he started well preaching the the word But later they started to you know get puffed up and they started to talk about revelations. You see danger. So the brother phones me. I say to the brother, brother, [Applause] firstly, eh, there's even some DVDs today criticizing Peter, criticizing the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, do you mean now if Peter is being criticized now, we should forsake Peter? They say Peter was the culprit. Judas was the right man to do the Some say Jesus had a son with [Music] Magician. Now I say now do you do you think we should now drop the Lord Jesus Christ? He's been criticized and the very same the Bible says they stoned the prophets. And when I said to the man, oh, he says it is Paul who brought in this thing. You know the stoning of the prophets again. Now, stoning Paul for bringing the word of God. You see what I mean? Amen. Amen. Why then there's this man who came again just on I don't know brother the brother is here he remembers when I think it's two days back or so forth he wanted to go to Bible school he was saying he has hunger for God I said then you don't need Bible school you need God. Hunger for God means you need God. If you thirst after water, you don't go first to school to learn about water. So it's if it's for God, it's from God. Amen. It's Samuel who called out. I mean the wait called him. Now he went to the wrong place. Daddy, did you call me? Daddy said no. No, no, no, no. Go to sleep. The word [Music] comeswhere. You know today people they hear the message. So he came again until the father said, "My son, when you hear that word, say here am I lord." Amen. Amen. Then as long as he was going to the father back to and fro, the word never continued until he did the right thing. Then the word now spoke to him. Brother Brenham says you must have the right attitude. Amen. Say the right words. Believe the right word. God will communicate with [Music] you. Here is the secret. The word is in the right and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word. mind in the bride. What the husband wants done, she does it in his name. She has thus said the Lord. That's why that's my theme. [Music] Thus said the Lord. [Music] Now this thus said the Lord, it doesn't mean to come and stand here and said thus said the Lord. The Lord had spoken already and the word is in the bride. That is what the Lord has said. Glory to [Applause] God. Amen. Amen. She has accepted the word from God. So that word in her says the Lord. Amen. Amen. You reject that word at your own peril. You reject it at your own peril because that is thus said Amen. She carries the blessing and the judgment. If you come to a true married wife, she will always say, "My husband, [Music] Amen. Amen. My husband has even taught me to not to do it this way. But as the head, he has injected his mind in the bride. Now the mind that was in the husband is now. [Music] The spoken word from the from the husband is fulfilled in the seed from the male produce when it is in the bride. The word from the male will be fulfilled in the bride. Glory to Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. You see it will only fulfilled in a human being before it reaches the goal. It is fulfilled is just the word will be fulfilled. When the word finds the place and it's now a person now that is the fulfillment of the word of God. The brother was talking to me. We were talking. The Bible says I will give you pastors according to my heart. They shall feed you. with knowledge and understanding. So now I'm looking for a pastor. For me to find a pastor. I should find the one God spoke of. The one he he will feed me. Yeah, that is a fulfillment. Now then I can say to you I have found that pastor. That's why the Lord Jesus came and he has done something some things on the people. Amen. And they would go and say we have found him. Now they had findings with them. They were the founders. That's [Music] why you find him. And after he had found you, after he has found you, he found him. What? You find him when he is in you. And the prophet of God says when he is he is in you, he makes you a revelation. [Applause] And now you don't just look for a revelation. Now you become a revelation. And now thus said the Lord means now you don't go to the people and say h he says now that is he Amen. Amen. Is not is the wife now the bride. My husband says so in the garden of Eden that woman she was called Adam. She was not supposed to speak to that serpent. Amen. Amen. because she carried with her the word of the husband. God said before h she was delivered because before this wife was delivered because she came out of the man God said God already had given the rules to the wave. Then the husband, the wife carried the word. Amen. Thou shalt not eat from this. Thou shall eat from this. Amen. Amen. So they were both carriers of that word. Now, now before the word could could be fulfilled, there was a crossbreed. The serpent came in and said, "What did the Lord say?" Just like the today woman the interpretation that killed killed them spiritually. So let's let me try to wrap up here. Now here is the secret. The secret is now listen closely. You say uh brothers, you know, I'm longing for the word. I'm I'm hungering for the word. But hunger for the word. Now you must know the secret. Where the word is. You get what I mean? the word. If the word is in the bride [Music] and they go somewhere else for the wedding you because the way you know the rich man said Lord can you send somebody said to Abraham can you send somebody back uh to do the right thing to preach to him not to come the way my way and he said to him Moses is there and the prophets what you need is not here is If they can't believe it there, they can't believe it here because what you need from here is already. So the prophet says now the secret is they wait look they stood there by the doors of the temple. waiting for the Messiah. And in the womb of Mary, there was a development. Amen. There in the manger there, there was a little child there. The body of God. Amen. Amen. And there if you move some kilometers away there, there was a big temple there and there were priests and moving around there. Amen. Amen. H waiting for the Messiah. And the Bible says Mary had a secret and she pondered these things in her heart. and the Pharisees and the [Music] scribes and the doctors of divinity and professors and so forth and the scientists and the Amen. All of them they didn't know about the secret. Now today we don't know about the seventh seal secret which is something that the bride of [Music] Christ has and she pers. Amen. They don't know about the secret because Mary was just a poor woman there. Even said to the prophet, I think you came to the wrong person. I don't even know a husband. I'm just, you know, I'm just a girl like this. Amen. And there were some dignitaries around there. Professor of what? What? Professor of what? What? God never he will never go to such places. Amen. He will always come to the meek, the [Music] humble, the [Music] uneducated. Those the people looked down, unknown people, but only known to God. Now the secret is the word is in the bride and the mind of because she has then it is gramatized. So the the the Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose. Now listen, no one can persuade them different. They have thus says the Lord. That's the only thing they know. Or they keep it still. They have thus the Lord or they'll keep still. They will do the works of God for it is himself in them. Now the prophet is not talking about now the word to the prophet to the brother. Amen. Amen. It's now not to it was a ministry of at the end of it. It's now and no laid the foundation. laid the word. Amen. And Rebecca came and the message picked up Rebecca for for Isaac as they wait picked up the bride in this day for Christ. Amen. So God bless you. I wish I should stop here. for to to be continued. Ain't you happy? Thus say, "Amen." Amen. You know, she talking about a vision no longer waiting for anything because she has it. beautiful man. What the angel did, the angel dropped the seed and Mary said, "Be it unto me." And the angel turn [Music] away. The seventh angel messenger came with a seed. Amen. Amen. He laid the seed. I was looking on a video. All right. It's so wonderful. Now these bears are female and male. Amen. Now the male uh he will come around. I think brother has seen it to dance around and so forth some kind of dances although it's not but some kind of dances to to wed the the woman and and the wife on on the branch there. Uh she's just monitoring, looking, turning and according to the tune and that one doing some things the [Music] husband. Amen. Amen. Then they tell you that the husband, the wife is pleased now and she will also do something to indicate to the husband [Music] that I accept your proposals. Amen. And so that is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. How you know he did things to the woman. This woman went to Calvary. While she was crying, he rose again. Amen. He brought power on the day of Pentecost. Amen. So, so the this woman was looking. Amen. And she has sent the way in the end time with Amen. Now she was watching this. How Rebecca was watching Ali, how Elaza prayed before Rebecca and God made her choice, his choice. And she was watching the conduct of Elaza. And he called her and said to her, "Will you go with this prophet?" He said yes. And they said, "Go and let your seed possess the gates of the enemies." Isn't he [Music] wonderful? So it is the same thing. The bride of Christ will possess the gates of their enemies. That is the third pool. The prophet says, "You have not yet seen all of it." He says, "When the squeeze comes, you will see the third pool in action." Amen. That's why they said to go, "When the enemy shall come, God will raise up a third pool. The third pool will ward off the enemy. Amen. God bless you. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. [Music]
