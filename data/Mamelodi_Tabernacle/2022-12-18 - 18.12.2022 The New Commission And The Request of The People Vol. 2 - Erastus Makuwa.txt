clear answer on it says if you if you don't know he says that's about his coming and that was the night before we we arrived here on Friday yeah yes Friday yeah night before that Friday I received

if the Rapture don't come before next week I realized in the Bible what is confusing the people about the seventh Dimension I mean the seventh season about to move table area Seven Seals it's something in this nature of this nature this nature uh brother do you have my oldest Bible of mine yes Revelation chapter 21.21 you know this one is old yeah yeah let me try to go faster now I have tried many times even in Malawi I there was one morning I thought that today I'm going to speak faster and I was with brother Timothy I said brother this time now yellow I'm going I want to go faster and he said don't try it amen amen just remain what you are that scripture and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the seven angle of God is with me and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their Lord amen amen now I want where it says is it verse 9. is it in Revelation 21 verse 9. yes yes and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven miles full of the seven last legs and talk with me saying come hither I will show a bit of light the length wife amen and he carried me away in the spirits to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her life was like unto the soul most precious even like the Justice okay then you go further it says where the city we saw the city coming down [Music] you know and saw we will reach all those scriptures things started to come down and even that very same scripture where it says that is from verse one just read that part from verse 1 . and I saw a new Heaven and the new end for the first Heaven and the first Empire passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of him amen amen yeah we'll read that we'll look at it coming down all the things that were in heaven [Music] coming he saw them coming down The Pride coming down the city coming down amen amen and Heaven stopped the Angels when things went out amen amen amen and then he continues to say then the Lord will be with us here on Earth you can finish it okay now there's another party I'm looking at before we and we start off the things no yeah we are looking at things here now we are going to follow these things I read in this book Elijah was a daughter and the servant couldn't see all those Angels around today [Music] and God changed not brought the Angels down but he changed the seeing of that young man and meaning that and there was the mountain full of angels Chariots of Fire around the prophets he changed death the scene the thing who was already there to see things that were there all the time and I believe what is that is what is happening to us these things have been there but to God came to change the scene because he says this like this seventh seal has been there from question is from Genesis from the beginning of Genesis the thing I've been there all the time but today he has changed our scene that we see the things that have been there you couldn't see them because it was not yet the time amen but when the time arrives we opened our eyes to see the things that have been there so this is what we are looking at I saw I will open this old scripture here forgive me because I've got this some books here yeah so there is uh my brother I I have I had this book with you senses this is the time I wonder it is here with me or with you says is this the time now your book says is this the time is it here okay oh God bless you God bless you God bless you yeah I borrowed the book from him then the commission now and uh because the word of God like like like it comes uh like in the folder sorry yeah it comes like the first seal a little second seal opening of the first scene okay showing that what has been sealed to the seventh year really I believe that it's open but now recently I wondered it okay foreign when he was I could see I just it's page 26. I believe you read these things amen amen you know they spoke and do it is pocket is not like the spoken nothing also yeah we are different types of people yeah now they're spoken with spoken with should be kept in their souls now in the soul every time it is opened [Music] that's when we peace [Music] the pages in your soul because you were made of this word foreign foreign [Music] like what do you call them the scientists [Music] [Music] says they want to know what is out there and there was one time when they were being yeah and they were together more because every time the all right let me put it this there was this scientists [Music] with an advanced telescope [Music] he could could take him further yeah now when they ask him uh what do you see now he said about the zodiacore about the universe [Music] the universe we shall never come to our conclusions why because then they write in their books we have discovered a new style but later they find that there's another one beyond that come around [Music] that one said hola unless God puts the universe in our souls we shall keep on probing that was a good answer we shall never come to conclusions unless the universe is put into our hearts [Music] as this morning will never come to conclusions if the weight is not in our souls we'll just be reading and reading but never come to conclusion it's a page of who we are where are we going all right amen now I reach yeah serious now here yes yes I could see I will start from here I could see those angels those shaped back Wings traveling faster faster than sound foreign [Music] they I I they were there I didn't have time to count I didn't have time no more than just look [Music] Mighty one's great powerful engines [Music] now with white wings and uh with whistling sound then I was caught up into this pyramidity now that is the Pyramid of the Angels oh yeah you have the Pyramid of Enoch pyramid then you come and you have the pyramid pyramid which is the interpretation of brother because as we say was responsible for the structure the pyramids then no one could interpret that pyramid in Egypt until the seventh Angel message amen amen he interpreted the pyramid both inside the seven steps to the king's chamber come on [Music] he is supernaturally discovered that Enoch yeah the seventh man from even scientists believe it that or he is the man responsible for the pyramid now the prophet of God tells me the pyramid is God's sign that's why you have seen throughout the years [Music] there will be a pyramid if you have followed the message God has blessed us we've been coming up with the pyramids [Music] from the beginning to the end I mean now the real Ministry has a pyramid side seven steps to God up to the king's chamber just like Abraham the ministry of Abraham as it says in the book it says in the book who is this melchized yeah who is this he was God you know he comes in many names when he fought in heaven he was Michael Jehovah you know amen and Christ question uh hey we will look at that we'll come to that Christ have you got this book no no I I was looking at it Christy is the mystery of God revealed you page that book yeah amen amen it doesn't say Jesus it says Christ the mystery not Jesus is it Jesus no amen because in if you go back was the spirit God is a spirit out of this spirit the logos out of the Lord the men okay that that is that free food originally the spirit the logos the logos the men out of the logos came forth amen amen and uh even you know the Bible says yeah we are born of God and he that is born of God uh [Music] he can keep himself but the Bible simply says because he is [Music] because he is born of God you can see you can keep yourself from singing but because yeah that's the simple answer if a man is born of God he cannot sin [Applause] sin is unbelief [Applause] okay now we see it that way it says Siri God gave himself birth to a son [Music] do you have it brother [Music] do you oh no comment brother do you have the book yeah okay God bless you yeah page 15. page 15. yeah yeah and I don't know pardon oh no sorry my friend there the first version book one cod cod but let me put it to you it says here God gave birth to his son every if God came back to his son yeah yeah yeah it's like that all right keep it like that I'll find it um let me read here let's stick to this constellation now because things to it according to their constellations it depends in which con stellation do you belong if you look at the stars how they almighty God plant it now you'll find a star maybe what we call the main stars [Music] then you always find a cluster who starts around that menu [Music] that is a church around Paul Fashions and so forth [Music] when Paul greeted them he said how did he greet the efficient Church age okay fine chapter one there I'll tell you while I'm looking just at this stability as I was with Moses yeah so shall I be amen amen amen yeah you don't need any copyrights amen you don't know need to look around for a copyright copyright for copyrights amen amen okay now I reach it's a wonderful thing as he was with Moses then he said so I will be the same way only don't be afraid it is my mission okay amen amen that's how we worship as he was with the seventh angel messenger so is he with us before I can go to worship I look for that place I will find the very same ministry as he was with Moses so easy [Music] before you go high away we have read yesterday I reminded the children of God he said to God Joshua [Music] if you say Hey brother thinks he's a Jewish I will say what about pasta because he says Joshua [Music] Joshua are those who will cause the children of God to cross over [Music] and I believe that we are on the other side of the church ages when the seals were open he said let us go beyond the curtain of time because there are seven churches speaks of time [Applause] we are Beyond Time [Music] [Applause] speaks of time Seven Seals speaks of Italians now that's why the seventh seal started back then all right now it is this way I am not in any church age [Music] neither is my pastor all right all right I remain quiet Paige let me try page 19. amen yeah all right the page 90 of This Book of seals either is 90 .

hate me saying blessing honor glory everything they see he says then he said talk about Jubilee the happy time amen John much have looked Johanna and when he's he he's seen a past the curtain of time then said there is joy [Applause] why we worship why we worship it is because we have seen ourselves you cannot really Worship in truth and Spirits unless you have seen yourself what make John to

representing them then he just he said just a little longer until uh there's no more they there there has to suffer they had to suffer amen amen you know what he's talking about but no he comes from here this last last seal seventh he is no more immediated that is the seventh seal when he comes there is no longer immediately he is a king from being a mediator now you go back to Abraham when that time arrives he met the king yesterday we said something when he said something in me met that melchized and one day I was there in mamelodi I said foreign I can count three amens here [Music]

believe in him to be the man of God if you believe him [Music] if you are not a hypocrite but if you are a True Believer if you believe this meant to be a man of God if you respect him you respect me
