coming further from the sleep where the devil is active at night but the father we have come because we are the overcomers we have to thank the lord because the bible says jesus said i have overcome the world so our duty is just to manifest the power of the lord father that we have given unto us we don't have to worry lord because while the father is coming from the devil the bible says in the book of john 14 he says we must not worry but we must believe we must believe father in the son and believe in god because lord we know that we have overcome everything father this is your church this is your pride we have come to worship the prophet says father the tabernacle is a place of worship it's not the place of gossip it's not a place father of having meetings which are unnecessary but this is the place of worship we have come further to adore thee we have come lord to say up our father there is no one like you lord we glorify your holy name this morning father we give you the honor for lord you await it to be praised and you are worthy to be worshipped father we know that in the time where we are we are living in the times where the bible says father the seventh seed it means everything father is getting to an end father we can even hear when the pastor is preaching that now father is preaching towards the end and the lord we know that father when we are going towards the end for the rapture which is coming we know that father there are two seeds lord which which are fighting lord but jesus said just leave everything to grow together it will be seen during the harvest time father we pray this morning lord for those fathers who are depending father in this prayer that the father helped them up this morning we pray for this service father we pray for everything that is going to happen we pray father for our pastor we pray lord that you just manifest yourself lord the bible says father the pastor has mentioned that that lord joshua one day when he was looking preparing for the war he saw father a man who was standing the bible says he went to that man and asked whether you are of us or we are against us but the men said i have come my father as the host or as the captain of the host of the lord even this morning lord we know that it is an invisible god there is father michael is with us lord whatever the satan has planned for this service we know that father he is defeated because we've got an invisible man who is walking around my father we thank you lord as we keep with that closely bless my father this service bless everything that is going to be done in today's physical service bless father our products living leading us with songs as we give you the glory and honor in the name of our lord and savior christ jesus we have prayed amen

babysitter sana just to come forth for a prayer for all the prayer requests and for the offerings and also for the tides these are the petitions that i have today sister nam samaguebu is asking for prayers for mama no one delay mayana who has a kidney the sister did a security course but the owner of the school did not submit the grades so as as a result she is not able to get the certificate so she is asking for a prayer so that the owner can answer the phone and submit the grades inaudible who is hospitalized and has a liver problem you know sister machade also asking for prayers for jessica a daughter the sister has a continuous headache and at the same time the sister is working 45 hours per week on a contract and they want to degrade the hours to 25 hours so it says shalom saints my prayer request begins with gratitude as i ask of you of your lord to bless us with forgiving hearts and that the desires of my to no off i trust and have faith that you will fulfill i pray for god i pray for good health for my mom who is diagnosed with dementia lord i trust you will heal it i pray for my addictions to fade away and heal my mind from what that depression i pray for the job application that i have sent through father we know that thou art divine and your power is also divine and our prayers are always find comfort lord almighty in your ears so whenever we power our heads down and pray unto thee so we're going to have a registration list so if you want to accompany the pastor to that outrage you register your name so that we can prepare for the number of people that will be requested hallelujah the place is not far is here in cape town park at pastor david it's herbal so cajo pere i believe we all have the holy ghost you don't just drive to pastor david without informing us you know there is that tendency to say i'll make a plan when i arrive there you know last time the pastor was going to preach there the service was supposed to start at ten six o'clock the people were already flocked today so that is not correct because there are believers there that has invited the pastor we only have a privilege to accompany the past so for the love of our pastor we are registered we don't just drive to captain park hallelujah so we don't just drive to cape town park we register and priority for us is in detail hallelujah only the elders that are accompanying the pastor and the camera crew will be inside the tabernacle hallelujah praise the lord [Applause] it's happening i don't have to say more aleduya amen and we were supposed to have an
