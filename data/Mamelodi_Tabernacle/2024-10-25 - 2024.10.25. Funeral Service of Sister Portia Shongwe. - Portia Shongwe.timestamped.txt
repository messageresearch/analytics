[1:01:30] Lord that has preserved
[1:01:34] us both physically and
[1:01:38] spiritually when I

[1:01:51] word now because he's excited about his

[1:01:58] possibly doesn't want to spoil his
[1:02:02] message so don't say this this old man
[1:02:06] is so
[1:02:08] greedy yesterday he was
[1:02:11] preaching and

[1:02:16] preacher it's him who said
[1:02:19] no may the Lord bless
[1:02:22] you uh let's read the word of
[1:02:27] God and again I want you to remind me
[1:02:30] whenever the H
[1:02:35] arrive please don't be afraid to tell us
[1:02:38] that now the time has
[1:02:43] come may the Lord bless you can we read
[1:02:47] from the book of
[1:02:50] Mark uh chapter 8
[1:02:55] us to read from verse 34 to
[1:03:02] 38 The Book of
[1:03:05] Mark
[1:03:07] 8 verse 34 to
[1:03:16] 37 and when he had called the people
[1:03:19] unto him with his disciples also he said
[1:03:23] unto them whosoever will come come after
[1:03:26] me let him deny himself and take up his
[1:03:29] cross and follow me for whosoever will
[1:03:32] save his life shall lose it but
[1:03:35] whosoever shall lose his life for my
[1:03:37] sake and the gospels the same shall save
[1:03:41] it for what shall it profit a man if he
[1:03:44] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[1:03:47] own soul or what shall a man give in
[1:03:50] exchange of his soul whosoever therefore
[1:03:54] shall be ashamed of me and of my wordss
[1:03:57] in this adulterous and sinful generation
[1:04:01] of him also shall the son of men be
[1:04:04] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[1:04:07] his father with the Holy Angels
[1:04:10] Hallelujah can we bow our
[1:04:13] heads gracious

[1:04:29] father we always invite you knowing that
[1:04:33] father your presence will always be
[1:04:36] sufficient for us amen we we are
[1:04:40] gathered here Lord as your
[1:04:42] seed and father as your offsprings amen
[1:04:46] and as your children Hallelujah we pray
[1:04:50] Lord Almighty that in Moment Like
[1:04:53] This may you always love Lord run before
[1:04:57] us or carry us Lord to your shoulders
[1:05:02] gracious Lord because thou are the
[1:05:05] breasted one Hallelujah as we have read
[1:05:08] the word father is the only comfort the
[1:05:11] one that can console this family not
[1:05:13] only this family yeah and everybody that
[1:05:17] has gathered here amen thank you Father
[1:05:20] for we pray in the precious name of our
[1:05:23] Lord Jesus Christ amen am you may be
[1:05:27] seated
[1:05:32] God okay mine is just to bring some
[1:05:37] words of
[1:05:40] comfort we know that as a human
[1:05:45] being you will never be you will bring
[1:05:49] we will never bring sufficient words of
[1:05:52] comfort
[1:05:56] that is why I'm reading the
[1:05:59] Bible and the other thing that I want to
[1:06:03] explain is
[1:06:07] that we have some
[1:06:10] Believers that we're fellowshipping
[1:06:13] together with our
[1:06:15] sister which would have liked to be in
[1:06:19] this fun
[1:06:25] but because it's during the week they
[1:06:27] couldn't make
[1:06:29] it but we have our friends
[1:06:33] here who are
[1:06:39] liveing we know people always
[1:06:43] are are getting surprised why we have to
[1:06:47] preach in
[1:06:50] English it's it's because there are some
[1:06:54] other people
[1:06:56] in different places that fellowship with
[1:07:00] us that don't understand our
[1:07:05] languages amen amen so it's just that to
[1:07:08] explain to those that don't
[1:07:13] understand but as for
[1:07:17] sister yes she
[1:07:20] was a saint
[1:07:23] indeed she loved to be at the
[1:07:27] service I remember we we we always
[1:07:30] encourage those that they have got some
[1:07:33] few
[1:07:37] sense to at
[1:07:40] home but she didn't like it she always
[1:07:44] want to come to the
[1:07:47] service even if we say we'll get you
[1:07:49] some data
[1:07:52] and but she prefers to come to the
[1:07:57] she had that Zeal within
[1:07:59] her okay fine so uh we've just read the
[1:08:05] scripture
[1:08:07] here the first verse that we
[1:08:10] read it says and when he had called the
[1:08:14] people unto him with his disciples
[1:08:19] also he said unto
[1:08:22] them whosoever will come after me
[1:08:27] let him deny
[1:08:30] himself and take up his
[1:08:32] cross and follow
[1:08:35] me the life of
[1:08:41] Christianity it's
[1:08:45] divine and it's not for
[1:08:49] everybody it's it's for those that are
[1:08:54] predestinated there are are some people
[1:08:56] that says to be a Christian is a boring
[1:09:02] life but some of
[1:09:04] us you see we are great
[1:09:08] headed but I started fellowshipping when
[1:09:10] I was still very
[1:09:13] young I never get
[1:09:17] bored so it's one thing that can keep
[1:09:23] you so that's why the Bible
[1:09:27] you deny
[1:09:29] yourself right amen and take up his
[1:09:34] cross and follow
[1:09:37] him so uh you can
[1:09:41] never worship god without denying
[1:09:47] yourself because there is your natural
[1:09:52] self and when you deny yourself
[1:09:56] you deny your natural
[1:09:59] self and take the Divine
[1:10:02] Life and when you divine
[1:10:06] yourself I mean when you when you deny
[1:10:09] yourself it's a
[1:10:18] challeng now when I'm denying himself
[1:10:25] I have to deny the nature
[1:10:30] of because the nature
[1:10:33] of it's contrary to the nature of
[1:10:37] God it's not
[1:10:40] Divine so I have to
[1:10:43] fight that is why now when you you you
[1:10:47] take your
[1:10:48] cross you know our Lord Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ just pointed Peter
[1:10:55] he said follow
[1:10:57] me he never question
[1:11:01] him he denied
[1:11:04] himself and left his
[1:11:06] father his mother children wife and
[1:11:11] followed
[1:11:12] him he said to
[1:11:15] Jesus what am I going to gain in
[1:11:17] following
[1:11:19] you then he said to him you will sit in
[1:11:23] a throne
[1:11:27] judge are we together now when he ask
[1:11:31] him that
[1:11:34] question uh he was not
[1:11:37] confused he could see that there's a
[1:11:39] power in this
[1:11:41] man see that there's a pool in
[1:11:46] this uh Elisha one
[1:11:49] day was
[1:11:52] plowing Elijah just came and touch
[1:11:57] didn't
[1:11:58] say just
[1:12:01] touch and dropped
[1:12:04] everything sort at all his
[1:12:07] cows and let people eat the
[1:12:10] Flesh and he followed
[1:12:13] El because there was a pool that
[1:12:17] was there was a supernal
[1:12:21] pool Divine
[1:12:23] pool is another better
[1:12:28] life Hallelujah then verse 35
[1:12:32] says for whosoever will save his life
[1:12:36] shall lose
[1:12:40] it you hear what he says
[1:12:44] whosoever want to save his
[1:12:47] life shall lose
[1:12:49] it now if you
[1:12:52] want to save your life
[1:12:55] know that youve already
[1:13:01] lost but whosoever shall lose his
[1:13:08] life for my sake and the
[1:13:12] gospels the same shall lose it I the
[1:13:16] same shall save
[1:13:18] it now you lose your
[1:13:21] life in order to save it
[1:13:25] and then once you try to save your
[1:13:29] life then you're going to lose
[1:13:31] it I don't know whether we are together
[1:13:35] don't try to save your
[1:13:38] life lose your life lose your
[1:13:42] life and what is your
[1:13:44] life your life is your
[1:13:48] soul you can keep your
[1:13:51] soul it's God that will keep your soul
[1:13:57] when God gave you a
[1:14:01] soul it was for his
[1:14:05] place it was not yours it was God's
[1:14:10] soul but when you were
[1:14:12] born you were born with a natural
[1:14:17] soul
[1:14:21] soul a soul was never created
[1:14:25] a soul comes directly from
[1:14:29] God are we together but now
[1:14:34] Soul the nature
[1:14:37] of and I always say that I always repeat
[1:14:42] that that you will never find kosana
[1:14:45] in any other
[1:14:49] dimension except this
[1:14:52] Dimension so the Bible says
[1:14:56] there will be the end of the
[1:14:59] world when he says the end of the
[1:15:02] world it means that's the end of the
[1:15:05] nature
[1:15:07] of that will be the end of the nature
[1:15:12] of if you want to keep
[1:15:15] it then you won't be able to save
[1:15:19] it are we together for
[1:15:23] whosoever shall gave his
[1:15:27] life shall lose
[1:15:30] it now one can
[1:15:32] say now I don't want to lose my
[1:15:37] life you know what is your
[1:15:41] life your life is the word of
[1:15:45] God and life with God I mean a life
[1:15:49] without
[1:15:51] God it's a lost life
[1:15:56] a life without the word of
[1:15:59] God it's a life that has
[1:16:06] been and then he says in verse
[1:16:09] 36 for what shall Prof what shall it
[1:16:12] profit a
[1:16:15] man if he shall gain the whole
[1:16:19] world and lose his own
[1:16:23] soul you see how is
[1:16:26] it you can gain the whole
[1:16:31] world but it will never profit
[1:16:34] you you gain the whole
[1:16:37] world and lose your
[1:16:41] soul then you have lose a place
[1:16:46] because there's a type here I'm I'm
[1:16:50] reading a
[1:16:52] quote it says the ark is a type of a
[1:16:56] human
[1:16:59] heart which means your heart is an ark
[1:17:03] of
[1:17:05] God right amen it's a hidden
[1:17:11] place for those that don't understand
[1:17:14] let me re explain
[1:17:19] that you your body is not yourself
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] your body is where your soul
[1:17:32] dwells and you've got a spirit within
[1:17:36] you which comes from
[1:17:39] God and you've got a soul within
[1:17:43] you also comes from
[1:17:46] God this
[1:17:48] body comes from the
[1:17:51] ground it's from the
[1:17:53] soil amen
[1:17:55] it's a
[1:17:56] dust are we
[1:17:59] together it's just you're just an animal
[1:18:02] the body that you were
[1:18:05] wearing the difference is that
[1:18:10] now God gave us a
[1:18:13] soul an
[1:18:15] animal hasn't got a soul so the
[1:18:18] difference between
[1:18:20] you and a dog is that you've got a soul
[1:18:26] but without the
[1:18:28] soul the same as a as a
[1:18:32] dog I'm I'm not trying to insult
[1:18:35] you I'm I'm showing you how
[1:18:40] important is your soul that is why
[1:18:44] here the Mark says
[1:18:49] there what shall it profit a man
[1:18:54] he shall gain the whole
[1:18:56] world and lose his own
[1:19:00] soul that's
[1:19:02] why the Bible
[1:19:04] says I will write my
[1:19:07] laws in their
[1:19:10] hearts where I put them in the tables of
[1:19:14] their
[1:19:15] heart showing
[1:19:18] that will be a Dwelling
[1:19:21] Place of God in other words
[1:19:25] the human
[1:19:27] heart is an
[1:19:29] ark it's a dwelling
[1:19:32] place for
[1:19:33] God Mark 387
[1:19:38] says or what shall a man give in
[1:19:41] exchange of his
[1:19:45] soul there's
[1:19:47] nothing that you can
[1:19:50] give in exchange of your soul
[1:19:56] that is
[1:19:57] why that place it's a it's God's place
[1:20:02] you can lose whatever you
[1:20:05] have but as long as you give over your
[1:20:08] soul and you lose it to
[1:20:13] Christ you lose it to
[1:20:17] Christ then you gain
[1:20:19] it then it's a gain once you lose your
[1:20:23] soul to Christ
[1:20:27] eternity then your place is eternal are
[1:20:31] we together
[1:20:34] am now it says in verse 38 ver
[1:20:38] 38 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed
[1:20:42] of
[1:20:44] me and of my
[1:20:49] words of my
[1:20:52] weight one day
[1:20:55] the
[1:20:56] Pharisees came to
[1:20:59] him and said what should we
[1:21:03] do in order that we should keep the word
[1:21:07] you know in order that we should be
[1:21:11] perfect you read it it's in John
[1:21:15] 6:29 69 then he
[1:21:18] said the only thing that you need to
[1:21:22] do very simple
[1:21:25] you just
[1:21:27] listen to the one that I have
[1:21:31] sent you listen to the send
[1:21:34] one the one that is
[1:21:37] send then that's
[1:21:39] all because I send people I sent human
[1:21:45] beings to come and speak to
[1:21:48] human and I became a human
[1:21:51] being and speak so that why the Bible
[1:21:55] says if you get ashamed of
[1:21:59] me as the sand
[1:22:02] one and of my
[1:22:06] words then he says now the life is in
[1:22:09] the
[1:22:10] word like I've read yesterday
[1:22:13] night that the words he says the words
[1:22:17] that I
[1:22:18] speak they are
[1:22:22] alive see the words that come from
[1:22:26] him they are
[1:22:30] life now this scripture these verses
[1:22:34] that we have
[1:22:36] read the prophet of God
[1:22:39] says he says God puts it in all four
[1:22:46] gospels and then he he calls
[1:22:50] them very important scriptures
[1:22:55] he says you'll find it in
[1:22:59] Matthew you'll find it in
[1:23:02] Mark you'll find it in
[1:23:05] Luke and you'll find it in
[1:23:07] John these are important
[1:23:12] words
[1:23:15] emphasized say this scripture is
[1:23:17] important God puts it in all
[1:23:22] four was so
[1:23:25] important he says you you get you you
[1:23:28] even get it six times in the
[1:23:31] Bible in the gospel six
[1:23:35] time
[1:23:38] saying uh whosoever shall save his
[1:23:42] life shall lose
[1:23:45] it how it will amen now the most
[1:23:49] valuable
[1:23:52] thing that you got
[1:23:55] is your
[1:23:56] soul the most valuable
[1:24:00] thing that
[1:24:02] you it's your
[1:24:05] soul and if you lose your
[1:24:08] soul to
[1:24:11] Jesus in other ways you believe in
[1:24:15] Jesus then you have kept
[1:24:18] it he's going to save
[1:24:21] it to everlasting life
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] now those that don't
[1:24:31] understand they say sister sh is
[1:24:37] dead those that
[1:24:39] understand they say sister sh has
[1:24:46] departed right and we said
[1:24:50] yesterday when somebody departs
[1:24:56] people call it death
[1:24:59] death we don't call it death we call it
[1:25:03] a
[1:25:04] resurrection we already we already
[1:25:07] jump to check where he
[1:25:11] is according to the promise the promise
[1:25:15] says if you depart from this
[1:25:19] Dimension you go to a better
[1:25:22] Dimension and if you get out of this
[1:25:25] body you go to another
[1:25:27] body and if you get out of this world
[1:25:31] you get into
[1:25:33] another are we
[1:25:35] together so now according to the word of
[1:25:40] God she's in another
[1:25:44] place where she don't have to
[1:25:48] eat you don't have to eat you don't have
[1:25:52] to wake up and go and work
[1:25:55] she a better
[1:25:59] place there's no
[1:26:02] one are we together amen it's a place
[1:26:05] where you
[1:26:07] rest and
[1:26:09] wait you wait for the
[1:26:13] resurrection that is why when they say
[1:26:16] he she is dead we say she has
[1:26:19] resurrected we we look at the
[1:26:21] resurrection
[1:26:24] because the the the the the
[1:26:28] resurrection
[1:26:30] started the way she the day she gave her
[1:26:33] life
[1:26:36] over that was the
[1:26:39] resurrection Soul
[1:26:42] resurrected it shifted from that of a
[1:26:47] family to that of
[1:26:50] divine shifted from the position I
[1:26:57] mean physical
[1:27:00] father and the Divine
[1:27:03] father shifted from the physical
[1:27:07] life and then got the Divine
[1:27:10] Life are we together amen now that shows
[1:27:15] that was the
[1:27:16] first if God can give
[1:27:19] you a natural life he can give you also
[1:27:23] spiritual life
[1:27:27] are we together amen if God can give you
[1:27:30] a first
[1:27:33] birth God can also give you a
[1:27:38] second the first birth is when you were
[1:27:41] born by your
[1:27:44] family you're born by your
[1:27:48] parents but that's not all then you need
[1:27:52] the second bed
[1:27:55] now when you get the the birth of your
[1:28:01] parents ends up in this
[1:28:05] box all your parents are
[1:28:08] there your great
[1:28:11] parents and your great great
[1:28:14] parents that is the birth of your
[1:28:18] parents but the Divine
[1:28:21] B it's eternal
[1:28:25] are you together the Divine
[1:28:28] Life is
[1:28:30] eternal that's what we need to
[1:28:33] concentrate
[1:28:35] on that's
[1:28:37] what she taught her
[1:28:42] children that's what she fought
[1:28:46] for the Divine
[1:28:49] Life not this temporal
[1:28:52] one here we are here
[1:28:56] temporary but there's a time where we
[1:28:59] are going to depart whether you like it
[1:29:03] or everybody is going to
[1:29:07] depart there are those that knows where
[1:29:10] are they
[1:29:13] going there are those that are not
[1:29:18] sure there are those that don't care
[1:29:24] say if there's Heaven it's up to that
[1:29:28] heaven if there's hell it's up to that
[1:29:31] hell I am still enjoying
[1:29:36] myself but now that is not the way of
[1:29:40] living the way of living is to sit and
[1:29:45] meditate about
[1:29:47] yourself about your journey you grown up
[1:29:52] know that one day you want to depart you
[1:29:56] can never depart and go where you don't
[1:30:00] know our our
[1:30:03] parents and our
[1:30:06] grandparents they say when you
[1:30:09] depart you're going to
[1:30:12] meet uh your
[1:30:15] ancestors I'm not a critical person but
[1:30:19] I put it very
[1:30:20] soft forget about that
[1:30:24] there there's nothing like
[1:30:27] ancestors foret about that God
[1:30:33] created start creating
[1:30:36] you he canot give you another ancestral
[1:30:40] life gave you his own
[1:30:44] life are we
[1:30:46] together so in a very simple and humble
[1:30:51] way forget about it
[1:30:56] as a
[1:30:57] man you need a
[1:30:59] spirit that will make you a new
[1:31:04] person that's what we called born
[1:31:07] again or
[1:31:10] reborn first
[1:31:13] birth brings a natural man on
[1:31:16] Earth second
[1:31:20] birth uh it brings a spiritual man
[1:31:25] of Heaven second bed brings a spiritual
[1:31:29] man of
[1:31:31] Heaven it changes him in other words it
[1:31:35] changes your
[1:31:38] soul
[1:31:40] from to the Eternal
[1:31:43] one but if you don't
[1:31:45] change and remain
[1:31:48] to no there's no eternity
[1:31:54] never heard about an
[1:31:59] angel never you also go and
[1:32:03] read you'll never have an angel called
[1:32:08] by your
[1:32:10] name my
[1:32:13] grandfather
[1:32:14] is I've never seen an angel
[1:32:19] called I read about Michael I read about
[1:32:24] I read about you know you call
[1:32:27] them right now there is another
[1:32:31] life and your life you've got an outward
[1:32:36] life and you've got an
[1:32:39] inward right am
[1:32:42] so so now the first
[1:32:46] death is the one
[1:32:49] that our
[1:32:51] sister has taken
[1:32:55] separating from our loved
[1:32:58] ones now let me show you
[1:33:02] that
[1:33:04] all those that had a first
[1:33:09] death where was our body where their
[1:33:12] body
[1:33:13] ended what happened to
[1:33:19] Paul N killed
[1:33:22] him
[1:33:25] EMP he killed him in a very cruel
[1:33:31] way but he killed the
[1:33:35] body what happened to
[1:33:39] Peter he
[1:33:41] was he had to go through a very very
[1:33:45] painful
[1:33:48] death until he said I want to be H
[1:33:52] crucified
[1:33:54] upside
[1:33:56] down my
[1:33:59] master and then what happened to the
[1:34:02] heroes during the first church
[1:34:05] age they were taken to the
[1:34:09] Arenas dogs while dogs were
[1:34:12] open them but they were singing
[1:34:16] Hallelujah they were singing hu what
[1:34:19] made them to sing when they were
[1:34:25] when the White Beast were coming to them
[1:34:28] they say hallelujah glory
[1:34:30] to this is just a
[1:34:36] transport now the real Christian
[1:34:45] principle is the
[1:34:48] resurrection how you that that is the
[1:34:51] Christian
[1:34:52] person Christianity
[1:34:55] in
[1:34:58] Resurrection always
[1:35:01] whenever you
[1:35:02] remember this king called
[1:35:06] hezekiel heah heah heah a prophet came
[1:35:10] to
[1:35:11] him and said mend up your
[1:35:14] ways because your time has
[1:35:18] ended the Bible says he looked at the
[1:35:22] allall he started praying
[1:35:25] he prayed
[1:35:27] and and then the the prophet came and
[1:35:31] said God has heard your
[1:35:35] prayer but he started by
[1:35:38] saying
[1:35:39] Rectify your life M up your
[1:35:45] family make sure that everything is
[1:35:49] right now the prophet
[1:35:52] says God can change his
[1:35:56] mind if you commit
[1:35:59] yourselfto
[1:36:01] him because the Bible
[1:36:04] says uh with the first man if you read
[1:36:08] First Corinthians chapter
[1:36:12] 15:22 for as in Adam all
[1:36:18] die see in Adam all die
[1:36:23] so in Christ shall be made
[1:36:29] alive because in Christ it's a
[1:36:32] quickening
[1:36:34] spirit Spirit that quickens
[1:36:37] you you'll never be sorry
[1:36:41] about wherever she is
[1:36:44] now she's not
[1:36:46] sorry wherever she
[1:36:49] is there is that thing at at times like
[1:36:54] the young sister was
[1:36:55] saying the mother was saying this and
[1:36:58] this she had that concern about us as a
[1:37:02] family when you
[1:37:05] depart it's only then that you'll see
[1:37:07] that was not my
[1:37:11] family because
[1:37:13] now you are in another
[1:37:16] F two types of
[1:37:19] family there's a
[1:37:21] natural there a supernatural
[1:37:24] and when you depart you go and meet your
[1:37:28] family this family the natural one when
[1:37:33] you are here got the nature of the
[1:37:36] earth you worried about your
[1:37:40] children when I depart what are they
[1:37:42] going
[1:37:43] to going to take care of but cross over
[1:37:46] you
[1:37:48] see you will see that your children are
[1:37:50] not your
[1:37:51] children your parents are not your
[1:37:54] I don't say you disrespect
[1:37:56] them but when you are in Earth that is
[1:38:00] the nature of of year
[1:38:02] on but once you cross
[1:38:05] over you know Jesus Christ when he was
[1:38:08] on the
[1:38:10] cross he said to Mary who was supposed
[1:38:14] to be his
[1:38:15] mother he said
[1:38:18] woman behold your
[1:38:21] son he show he showed him John
[1:38:25] in other words say no you are not my
[1:38:28] mother now don't go and tell your
[1:38:30] mothers that they are not your
[1:38:33] mothers they are your mothers but I'm
[1:38:36] just showing
[1:38:37] you the the the supernatural
[1:38:42] life there's a
[1:38:45] scripture I'm not going to read it I'm
[1:38:47] going to
[1:38:48] coach it's in Matthew
[1:38:51] 28 verse 20 verse 20 you know when
[1:38:56] deaths
[1:38:58] come we always think about life after
[1:39:04] death we don't we don't we don't start
[1:39:08] crying well of course it's like this
[1:39:11] when when
[1:39:13] somebody like your parents like your
[1:39:17] friend like a family member if one
[1:39:20] passes on naturally is that thing in
[1:39:24] your
[1:39:25] heart that you cannot hold
[1:39:27] yourself it's
[1:39:29] good it's supposed to be like that when
[1:39:33] Steven was was was was
[1:39:36] murdered then
[1:39:38] they the the
[1:39:41] disciples were were were were were taken
[1:39:46] up they went and bury him they they
[1:39:49] cried they cried but they were the
[1:39:52] disciples
[1:39:53] and and the apostles but there is that
[1:39:56] natural
[1:39:59] feeling then after that then consider
[1:40:03] who are
[1:40:05] you think about life after
[1:40:08] death things about the other
[1:40:12] dimensions then the scripture that I
[1:40:14] wanted to read
[1:40:15] is uh you must just tell me when they've
[1:40:19] arrived it says Matthew 28:20 have got
[1:40:23] it my brother amen okay I'll read it
[1:40:25] here teaching them to observe all things
[1:40:29] whatsoever I have commanded
[1:40:36] you and L I Am With You
[1:40:43] Always even until the end of
[1:40:47] the now such
[1:40:49] promises look what he says
[1:40:53] be with
[1:40:54] you all
[1:40:57] way up to the end of the
[1:41:00] world there's no part where you will
[1:41:04] miss
[1:41:05] me I am always with
[1:41:08] you that's the
[1:41:11] person that you will not
[1:41:16] lose you will never lose you so now I'm
[1:41:19] saying that to to her
[1:41:22] children Jesus Christ
[1:41:24] says
[1:41:26] firstly you should be taught to observe
[1:41:29] all
[1:41:31] things that he has commanded us
[1:41:34] to all the safer
[1:41:37] part
[1:41:39] if You observe all
[1:41:43] things and then he says I
[1:41:47] am he doesn't say I will be he says I am
[1:41:52] with you
[1:41:54] all the way all the
[1:41:55] way so now even if your mother is
[1:42:00] departed but there is somebody that is
[1:42:03] with
[1:42:06] you must know even the end of the
[1:42:11] world right yesterday I was telling
[1:42:15] you about changing the
[1:42:18] dispensation that now when you change
[1:42:20] from one dispensation
[1:42:23] to
[1:42:25] another that's where the power
[1:42:29] is that's where the power is oh thank
[1:42:31] you thank
[1:42:34] you so now if you
[1:42:37] change from one
[1:42:40] dispensation of your of your uh human
[1:42:43] blood
[1:42:47] dispensation and change to the super
[1:42:50] Supernatural
