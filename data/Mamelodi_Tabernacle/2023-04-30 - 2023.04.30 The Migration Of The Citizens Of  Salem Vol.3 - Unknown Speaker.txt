able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such a high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens God bless you as you take your seats did you hear where it said Andy that the Man became Arena uh but do you understand description because in Genesis let us hurry make man the remote meaning that you were also included in everything that that God would do we were now over all locations then truly you should be part of every word attacked by the seventh angel message [Music] like this we are looking at this uh getting into contact with that great magnetism and you know when I was still um I used to go from this church to that church now I remember some of the churches in one of the churches I visited amen this song they were singing this song I don't know whether it's a song yes sir yeah in [Music] um [Music] yeah they are never in contact amen amen they are just in contact with one another foreign dimensions we are still there with our kids amen amen and I we have read these things about the dimensions but uh yesterday I was reading with something about this Dimensions study dimensions and the brother here this morning [Music] okay and brother hey you offered me this book but yet I'm looking for the place page 16. oh [Music] it says Siri and I believe that is it page 16 brother well let me start from there let me start from page 15.15 paragraph 118 here mole paragraph 118. yeah so so to bring us to the meaning of this great contact with this with that great magnet are you glad you are in here this morning okay um one place it says mortal beings let me start from day 14 this party I have never believed that heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings where there's a bunch of houses up there made with Motorola foreign it's in the human heart and all the resonance fade away the [Music] God becomes the festival like in this morning uh I have sometimes back I know how I was invited for the a funeral on Sunday that's all I mean so that's why I I do not attend attend I'm not giving out a lot to some other people but I'm saying I don't attend funerals on Sundays in respect of the Resurrection Day amen then uh nothing I don't do things in fear of the people I do things in fear of God amen like sometimes one would say in the morning I'm I'm going for my my my son like orange I'm going to help to my heart I will only that my my mother is late and they wanted me to come for such a thing yeah that was a Sunday morning I said no no Sunday morning so I must be in the house amen all right there's two natures now the every time there's something happening like this funeral on Sunday morning then we will check which spirit is going to and catch up Sunday morning which spirit will catch up with that this spirit says you you get what I mean that's why we're looking at the the great in getting into contacts and uh even to today I think we you should always know what where are you um what time is it because if you don't know the time you don't know what to do now let me read it that is Fellowship by Redemption not just fellowships Redemption is to do what yeah is to be taken back that is now that that's why we have this word Redemption they redeemed the people that were taken back that means they are redeemed called the bank again because you have no starting points on did you know that now we will read you we will read it amen and here it says heaven was a place where there is a bunch of buildings [Music] currently no I want uh I never believed that supernatural being who already would have to live in a literal house I believe when Jesus my father's house [Music] a Dwelling Place amen amen because uh it says and [Music] for the scripture they verify that is the same thing and say if this is we have one already let's hope Immortal beings live in immortal habitations amen amen then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar oh another fellow [Music] is your stones let me now get down to this yeah says I've got the Revelation the other day foreign [Music] a space over to Mars through the continents you know if you can look around and see Mars and they look at yourself and so forth and light traveling at so many thousands miles per hour that's why they say how great if an angel Started From The Far rest and coming here it will take it it will take it billions times billions billions of years more all right now you can put yourself in there engage yourself see where you fit I myself and then you will turn to the one that I am [Music] yeah that's him the I am but really but if it's I live by the grace of him that I am there's nothing I can do amen the day you are born we can count some years from then because when you are born there's an old man here an old woman and predictions are made that we want this child to be a scientists and what about this the mother of the mother of this healing my boy what about this grandmother she's sitting there going around following the sun now you are predicting for this challenge now what are you saying about them you see life how life human life that's why I can't boost of anything yes it's life my life is [Music] all right amen today I'm here tomorrow yeah I can be rich [Music] does that mean anything because you won't bury me with me with money all right um when I leave yeah now I cannot believe there's a house up Beyond that's um but I believe that that a house that God was speaking of what's right here or NAFA I mean we are one of this life can you see you see this life foreign foreign [Music] and she never said the best Resurrection this the best coffin is made by me rejoice amen we are going whether we like it or not [Music] no the place of Mortals all right let me quickly ER tie this to them in the fourth dimension more Dimensions do you know about the fourth dimensions here's another book presentation of my Ministry but we have contact with contact through but remember our ours here is contact with that great whoops okay amen that's why even this morning I could not attend any other things if actually all right amen now through science the fourth Dimensions as it was uh because coming right through this building it's pictures voices of radio what a little radio pictures on television now comes pictures voices of radio I read you all the pictures on television you know pictures our senses that picks up those other waves and manifest them but our but they have a truth all right amen you know and then uh a a troop or a crystal that picks up those other other waves for crystals and money first you know that's why we like as the bride of Christ we needed a truth behold I will send to Elijah [Music] and when the seventh angels bring those things we could not see with our eyes to bring that to us and that's why foreign a king of Salem okay amen and before he could make it to Salem he had to get into contact even this morning before I come to the city I had to get into college everything comes through a certain context all right foreign foreign now uh this is a fourth dimension really give four dimension here okay amen yeah now I'm trying to come to the magnet yeah uh so that Holy you can know who I am and who you are um [Music] when that man spoke about the ancient one um [Music] [Music] you know even in the book movie you see it says and in the ancient of times I saw in the ancient of times foreign [Applause] they came from there a thing of God they didn't start today no if you are a child of God it is because [Music] [Applause] and uh I was greeted by a story Write Your Story [Music] you know those stories you remember that stories like the ghost of mama when it is the time of that story even even the mothers when he's healing now we have stories and he will stop everything and switch off them so that she can continue with the ghost of madimala hey brother we are living in another world okay now Charlie and I arrive at the certain house one of this is the book I saw in the kitchen this story then she just quickly said to me the father is is in the sauce [Music] [Music] through this room is now write your activity foreign you will get into it that's just as real as television pictures [Music] fourth dimension you'll see the Pokemon you will see the ghost of mudimulla when you see things amen amen you can name them foreign [Music] the reason that you can see it the thing is he says the fourth dimension all the dimensions voice come on and what the pictures pictures sounds right amen now Jolly you come down and even some people when there is uh maybe the time Yahoo what do you call it now this system here when the message live streaming live streaming live streaming daily they will choose because it is live streaming live streaming but there's another thing on the television [Music] they will swing to one of each amen they are ruled emotionally is [Music] and of course you people you want to see yourself amen amen one day we will make a sort of competition a competition just to say who knows each and every one um [Music] how many hours do you take on the mirror oh you look at yourself you see I'm in seeing yourself that's why they introduce selfies amen but should you ask the people um uh well yeah really competition now this one you can't do a competition to see God that's something else because to see God you've got to switch off road someday if you want to see yourself you worship yourself I'm inviting you to something um amen touching Jesus say it in your life will never be this way there is only there is only one way to touch [Music] [Applause] so [Music] popular okay amen now since the rapture and actual Direction it's just yeah uh you know even uh flame our flame machine Leafly machinery it arrives that one is ourselves that's the one for Tanzania but we are not yet inside but we can see it [Applause] thank you also I remember one day we were a bit late she and because it is so important to you know a fly machine flying is not like taking a taxi a taxi taxi you can shout from there when it has already started that takes you to stop amen and then because because [Music] can you come running and again what happens is we came running even in England yeah I'm not a marathon runner yesterday you know you run even if you are not running you must just throw your legs all right amen so you see it is already where is there already wow anymore [Applause] that's why we brought the message about it rupturing yes [Music] he started working towards he didn't just say that lying on the bed already are we still stuck under the fourth dimensions where we want to be seen of the world we want to see ourselves okay amen I want that chorus do you know that is yes that is one of them one it is even in the songs of worship foreign [Music] say it there to save forever all be saving grace yeah on their Clouds Of Glory let me lift my hand oh oh made last ever to Rejoice amen because this is not time to sing after this I think we haven't yet come into the magnets Revelation chapter 21. brother [Music] foreign Revelation chapter 21 verse 3. and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me would you mind starting with verse from verse 1. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away amen Amen brother punishment the first seven and the first Earth the fastest way is it gonna happen like that now where are we going Arya and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city in New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven amen prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God amen amen can you get into contact amen if you happen to getting contact with it some people will wonder what's wrong with this because you are in contact [Music] now somebody who is not in contact the man is in contact amen [Applause] that's why we say when we leave this water it's old world this old world you are a young generation there was another generation [Music] in this same foreign I remember when I was young living at my uncle's house we didn't have cell phones at the time music nearly gramophone now um all the neighbors will be coming to say oh they've they've brought a they bought a gramophone no usually is it still the age of grammar foreign I can't talk about today communication systems today yeah me no Ace yeah all right let me leave it there you know it at times I will come to a place in the office more office and I will just realize that I I will not cope with this yeah I'll just go into the office where I just read the Bible all right I would I go with the brothers if you can send me there I will just come so I have come to the bank I would not know foreign okay before we close we are I'm getting this from Abraham Abraham how did he meet um now we'll say again foreign almost the greater number is silent on that when he met Abraham he was God but when he met Abraham king of Salem and what it says all the attributes at the end of time when he met this hymn healing Abraham he was Melchizedek but when he met with Brenham under the opening of the seals he is amen [Applause] a day [Applause] the seventh which is the end of Allah when it is the end of all things same God yeah that's the difference now that's why we brought that what was the music the migration of the citizens of salad yeah a citizen amen okay you know as a citizen I know he missed milk okay before we just close here I'm looking at this now did you see now I wonder what it says here if you go beyond that Force foreign that's right amen how long are you gonna remain seeing yourself if we were to say let us stand before seeing looking at ourselves how long will you wait before or stand before the mirror even some hours it's a long time but fella if we were invited to look at the Lord Jesus [Applause] no usually I can challenge you say okay stand before the mirror look at yourself the years you start to age amen amen you will actually be angry with yourself and say our it's tough I heard my uncle yeah we used to use his style his style [Music] I'm going to visit but it is um if you were to look at yourself for some years only when you are young I've never seen my Google standing there foreign oh they will end up all things and understanding idling they're saying again are we not going to church we are coming we are coming we are still in the mirrorism we can still see ourselves [Music] all right okay now here we are here I'm trying to say actually what I'm trying to say the bride of Christ today it's all ready in the constellations [Applause] when Jesus was born there was a constellation and the three Majors they got into that Constitution even even if we don't understand it and the prophet of God they brought it down Stars they were their presence there we are not magnetic to any other person but to the majors because uh it was inside of them in the first Bible movie because the first Bible okay amen and then now the Stars the stars are believers even the prophet of God believe the god foreign [Music] [Applause] Muji all right amen that's why they say take the whole world but give me because I will repeat for a few years but later I would not want to see myself foreign wait all right I'm losing here now it's beyond the fourth Dimension fourth dimensions what is keeping you so young ah man the thing is looking at another person most important a person that is seven years old yes every seven years so that it's not the the seven years it doesn't get it hasn't reached seven years once you reach seven years you would have changed foreign but let's finish here there is a man in you I'll show you that menu that that man is called um now this man is a [Music] from God ultra um if you don't know him how much he was there all right amen I'm trying to find something here okay let me try to find it this man was there I'm stuck here by saying uh in my bookcase page 433 this book of Hebrews there is a supernatural right it's very a supernatural amen the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos [Music] uh if you know the logos would you expect a a funeral for the logos no you're right that is another person without finish without hospitals operation now you know that yeah if you were a local foreign this present time and the future in this

thinking okay we are just talking about life I'm telling you that yeah the the right is now usually amen all right amen saying that the Bible says we believe he will come out and then to pick us up he won't touch it don't ever dream that the Lord will come down and you say hey Lord Jesus I also wanted to do good amen amen but this and this is I'm in that's why the prophet puts it is so it's happening now that means you have to expect another all all of the brides amen you see it only when the seventh is what happened to those uh I don't know I don't have the book now but you know it says

talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear and Crystal and had a wall great and high and had 12 gates

efforts of the people trying to help him and he said okay he showed me that cross and I'll find my um he didn't need any more helpers because he has seen he has found it the men who was in the cross
