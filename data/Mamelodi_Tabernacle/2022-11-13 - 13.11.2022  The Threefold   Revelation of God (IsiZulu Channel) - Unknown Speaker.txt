Jesus said that is Christ is the mystery of God reveals again continue pull back and that's this day he says that that is this day at that day when this Revelation is made known that is that day amen as brothers Christ who Christ has been made known in the church church now Christ is all right amen made it known as as this one I mean I mean listen that day now mind you the person he was talking could mean surely he must appear when that day at that day foreign these are these are the people who can serve God because he has spoken to them amen all right now listen then I will send you Elijah the prophet notice or to some beings I will send you Elijah the prophet is and food now it can't just end up [Music] that's right then he tells you what Elijah let's take it from here now a three-fold Revelation is it's a great thing let me see there's something here in this very same book is 69 I'm reading this yeah one day says false prophet um prophet we have heard him as well and food we have arrived now listen she figured how God revealed himself I will start from here must follow the head it is part of his resurrection because I live [Music] amen right then it says it together the bride body um that's why we are not confused for it is part of his resurrection part of the Mysteries not it is impossible for or for for it not to go against hey there Resurrection part of the mystery [Music] it's part of part of God's mystery now if you talk about the mysteries of God the bride is part of that Ministry amen no matter the mystery is not known to men that's why the Bible says the world don't know foreign foreign because he is full of love if Christ is in you um [Music] now if the love is in you um they died together they preached together yes I'm standing here they are together [Music] okay amen now I read your food therefore and God revealed himself here and raise it up the church by the weight is the real church is the one that is and raising it by the same way it's a part of these threefold but [Music] I I I I I'm looking at this at this one you shall know who who shall live is that your brother amen do you know that day which day all right this day when the seals are revealed is you were not Spirituals foreign [Music] but what really put me in this area he says and that's this day when this Revelation is made known yes that I am in my father and the father in me it is called a three-fold revelation just as brother Branham says even the Bible says God would never do anything without revealing To His prophets he said continue uh at this day when this Revelation is made known yes now the Revelation not only made known yes and then you know in the in the New Testament I and my father and food do you know what was happening we asked he never spoke of the Holy Ghost before he was crucified foreign but when he was crucified [Music] he said I and my father Philip don't you know that Philip I was with my father my father is in me this is because he was still with them amen but after he left them for them of the Holy Ghost yes when the Revelation comes forth I in you foreign try it's I in you now the Revelation that was coming for you to recognize it is you come this way amen I in you and you in me yeah see the money forward manifestation to bring it back now at that day you shall know in my father was supposed to be manifested amen it can't just remain a scriptures [Music] when God speaks they speak amen When God Says they don't come second to that now hide you remember they were three they said to Abraham where is your wife Abraham said back in the tents ended he said why said he not there I born he said why is it I shall return according to the time of life in this country so yeah amen not we shall return that's why you see today a stranger we don't we know not foreign foreign relevant or is that the weight is that the right way okay now I'm saying managing it here if he is not your head um which can be ahead with a headache then they say when the Revelation comes forth we must speak example this is another thing why you know sometimes we used to worship without any revelation we have the questions that's why we used to even try to read many books yes Samaritan woman says when he is will tell us all things not every body can tell you all things okay [Music] all right now he says no okay the manifold threefold is somebody so the church can do the same thing today because being part of the Baba [Music] and that day you shall know that I came in my father you and me again amen meaning when the father says something [Music] and we will also say this amen foreign it is the father who has spoken the whole body now um amen the body of Christ is not five people they're saying a difference I know the people don't want me to say this yes it is because they didn't hear Brothers saying some other things amen I yeah let me read that day you will know it means that you will you will know that that here is that thing the ocean your teeth mean it's not one thing threefold Revelations and you'll know that I am in the Father the father is in me amen let me leave it there and I will continue now now let's take this other scripture and then from there we are going to carry on like that God will help us to finish all right amen I'm going to look at the other scripture you need to Mark Baker um [Music] come to pass know that it is not even at the doors verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my way shall not pass away but of that day in that hour noeth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father okay is it not referring to the time of the opening of the seals is foreign foreign look no men nor angels which are in heaven alone you know according to Luke chapter three times I give it to us where it says at the last this one it comes to Adams which was the son of knows which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God right Adam was the Son of God Amen Jesus who Jesus came in as a substitute [Music] he has more food you know my books are so old foreign no not the angels meaning that I'm asking even the sandwich son the abuse because there's a time when it goes beyond the sunship if you go back to this threefold Revelation together it is God that I'm in the My Father Again how many things it is one thing but it is called a God if you go to your father um then you go is the father he tells you something you will confirm the same things foreign [Music] all right I mean if they hear you they hear me says God um you hear God Amen when it comes the time of the three four my figure is [Music] you go to uh you know that man that died amen [Music] because it is one chain all right amen now right foreign God is the way now this great book here in Christ the Mysteries right Lungi what when he's he says something like this is Christ who Christ because Christopher [Music] that's why you are a Christian that doesn't that doesn't mean if you pack spoken within your pocket you are a you are the bread of Grace you are carrying a Bible with you then it makes you a Christian um you hear that some people saying hey everybody um and God the answer of God to us amen you know many people yes because they want to do hairstyles those things so now if you preach um against those things not not against the person um you know if I want to know the people I can just stand here and say we sing it drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God foreign he has taken a lot of liquor cool now munch it was my brother-in-law we were passing some some men were trying to help that man listen to Latina myself foreign oh you know the Bible says what is men the Bible says what is men because God and he took the form not of angels that's why Hebrew says what is man to be so mindful amen he took not the form of angels what of Abraham is he came to you not the form of angels and the Seed of Abraham these are the only people who saw melchized um I'll say something maybe you can be able to digest it says it came as as what um prophet who came as a prophet foreign Abraham he was just he was a man that's why Abraham said to Sarah have you ever seen Melchizedek without father without mother no beginning of days on the table eating yes amen [Music] could come to our house amen Liberty uh uh the Seed of Abraham [Music] Christ in Christ Christ is the anointing comes the weight was made flesh he is [Music] foreign God um God gave himself um amen amen from the same God came forth a song it says but I ask a question which son is because the sonship Jesus came as a substitute that's why you know let me read you something here I don't know I'll find it now look anything that had a beginning that is mine I think that had a beginning amen and some people today he was born now man the body Jesus it's like this came down West with the seed that that is the way please then he he spoke to Mary Maria then Mary said I'm a virgin and Gabriel okay one are easily he gave the vision into God's word just as the bride of Christ [Music] amen she has never taken the weight of any other man is it you are talking to daughter he says why is it that thing in you of the Holy that word Mary believed okay and when it materialized lapo it became blood is we became blood that's why if they say you are washed um yes it is now it is when it comes and their son was born foreign [Music] I mean naturally it's somebody mundu uh she is human but because she is a daughter of God she will keep herself no one can do that unless he's a daughter of God okay comments can keep herself is foreign the word is yes look anything that had a beginning has an end in a spirit I can prove to you after buying a car we celebrated amen a young man I used to work with so um you know we the zombies where I come from if somebody buys a car a multi is the family members and the relatives they put up they threw a party but one state of them eggs [Music] anything that let me finish anything that had a beginning has an inch if because anything that had a beginning is a creation [Music] no now he says God created Italian amen your soul [Music] um okay now listen yeah God was not created he was always God there's no place he was created and the only way we can have eternal life is that creation which is not talking about material things God created then it comes again and says Heaven and Earth shall pass away it was created then foreign [Applause] foreign all right you know the undertakers were they he said this is the people who came to help with my mother's burial this lady said people is that's why Stevens Stevens you know as I'm saying Miss Stevens yes wonderful gift from the Stephen's family yeah you'll see each other you know when he was Stone no Stephanie you know Brothers he felt not even once too when he was stoned magical now imagine a person can be in Afrikaans they say scatterage the Africans another way word in English they say filthy yeah filthy terrible I'm he has started somewhere that's why even this morning amen I usually I don't know whether it's a good thing or not um I always don't enjoy these people you'd be working with [Music] and you say won't you buy peanuts here for us I asked a brother I hear my friend I said this is anything it wasn't there but they took my weight why is this is [Laughter] yes yeah even if you say to a person they are selling this thing here but there is a land this baby these people they are on migration Maya Humber I mean now they are selling things they are selling things cheap here foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign then you start thinking Sometimes using the appointment some of you smoke here yeah we know amen a child of God amen amen you know but my brother because I mean Babylon and the circumstances [Applause] that's a child of God I don't know how many children of God are here [Music] those who went even in secret mission whether he or she's alone yes against the word of God a child of God amen when a child of God the nature of God the nature of God now let me close with this anything that had the beginning [Applause] because anything that had a beginning but God was not created and the only way that we can ever have eternal life the first creation that was not created the Bible says this is the first born of oil [Music] I ask you about it Italian Joseph don't interfere put yourself all right himself gave birth when you are born of God to open you can't say because [Music] no that is not salvation Salvation is that you are born of God amen foreign for you'll be holy when this this Wednesday no no which even the son don't know because God there is no such ship I promise that is page two 73 red pepper 273 we adjusted the beginning of this thing she said oh my oh part of this uh oh here is part of this brother God bless 273 273 let me read you this one um [Music] yeah here we are the kept the cat okay in the first place when God the logos that went out of God the Catholic call it the Eternal sonship of God I have said before now the way that shouldn't make sense the sun was a substitute a son has to have a um Jesus was born foreign if you know such things together the reason I left the message because he was born I mean but in him something else no tease that's why he says he says destroy this body I will raise it up there is this body now if you just destroy this boy I mean amen amen you know there's this body and you yeah [Applause] you can't control it unless this body is rebellious rebellious let me tell you something you know right now we are in the service they'll go they are always up

life he said a Good Shepherd but he um it was a drama he played yes he was in control he was in control he was never in danger he commanded the whole thing he even taught them how to kill him amen
