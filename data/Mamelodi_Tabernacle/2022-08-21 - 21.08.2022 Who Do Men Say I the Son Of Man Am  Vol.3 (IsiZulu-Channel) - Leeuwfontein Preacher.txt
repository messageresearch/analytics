[Applause] now m [Music] is [Applause] this is the end of time in a lesson to check up with the our electricity here okay we'll give you the news shall continue to worship the lord so i always ask babies i'm having a clog before me andover and season [Music] before see no brother in the lord [Music] is and so um i think it's registered that next time the pastor will know how many god will do will give us a program the question today is um is start fine let's we are going to turn to our scriptures see though and then we have just helped some mamas outside here with their children but if there's something else [Music] we are always he says you are more than conquerors we are in the house of the lord we are here to worship the almighty god who created heaven and earth and even satan himself is we are so thankful to be in this place again father this after this morning your children here in this part of their earth father god being predestinated and called to serve the almighty god and father we believe father we believe that our pastor here is a real pastor being ordained in the last days father like joshua of old to take the people across and we are here satan fathered and done one didn't like this service to take place but there is jesus the one who has planned it and the father you planted it here you have planted this church here and it will remain here in jesus christ's name i pray for the word we are about to partake of we believe father this word is special for this especially father was ordained for this day and bless our pastor here pastor edgar also here father the man of god from malawi we are all together and there's a day that is coming when we shall be summoned further to arrive for the new jerusalem jesus is lord and father we are so glad that we shall arrive thank you lord we are here for your word again this morning we believe you have prepared at the table for us father in jesus christ's name we thank you lord we shall sit back and hear from thee in jesus christ's name i pray amen and shall we be seated say god god bless you is that one matthew's chapter 16 verse 13 to 19 i i have a brother here i don't know if he's ready with his bible okay god bless you tuna when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi which is may i ask from the pastor whether we should read in our language vernacular or in english well the pastor says it's fine verse 14 and they said [Music] all right here we are it's a question who do men say that i'm the son of men here the question is the son of man the answer is the son of the leading god amen and when he was the son of man he will look into it he was not when he was with them that's what he called himself and he was not a mediator as the son of man being with them obeying us and you and he now changed from being the son of man to the son of god we will realize as the son of god he becomes a mediator of the new testament now these things because in the book christ is the mystery of god and what in christ is the mystery of god in prophetic [Music] elijah called elijah elijah is elisha and he he also started to walk towards the chariot amen as the and i think you have also noticed that we are living with one church each year c church they are in the sixth dimension one's remaining she said as the bible puts it and we that are alive it says it i think i do i believe we are aware of this we are the last church age we're going to see bandana ages i have read this i think time and again page 20 to 21. not the rapture now we find out here enoch was the seventh man which was the type of the church ages now all of the rest of six men before him died amen we are talking about the seven church ages we are the remaining and yet we are not in the church ages and according to revelation chapter four now we are no longer in the church age the bride is not in the church age okay all right i think here we we have this in this book here well if you are not in the church age yeah okay sometimes i miss some pages here because he's cutting because revelation chapter 4 just read it for me there i've got the spoken right here after this i looked and behold [Music] okay how he puts it in here and that is page 90 that is a sales 90 we must say i can't tell which vision is this but you you can pick it up according to the paragraph that is paragraph 155 paragraph 155 the same book but you're nothing now here he says in this one that is page 90 in this one paragraph 55 paragraph 55 155 155 yes and john johan in the spirit here in heaven emilia is winning he's just been lifted up from the church ages [Music] he has just been lifted up from the church ages [Music] he saw the church ages and then he was taken up while they said you would say in ubisoft in the fourth chapter you will find also the same thing if you read the book revelation chapter 21 verse 9. good revelation come up chapter 21 [Music] is and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god amen because the prophet says [Music] it carries a pyramid because jerusalem is like a pyramid yeah and the throne the throne is on top there is a lighthouse you know a [Music] no in america there what was the place called a photo of a lighthouse storm be toughly in his house there's two lights there now i i read from that thing now when the ship is far away um the top available with me but i will just explain something here any painting because it is like this with god even men don't know this the first sign abraham and this is the last sign was jehovah talking to them in the form of amen because the first sign let finally when god was creating like like in an evolution but not evolution complete creation god bless he creates or whatever god it has to come to a perfection but finally finally means that all this and that and that and finally amen they came forth upon the earth and perfection you know if you are a christian you are always looking for perfection the bible says be therefore perfect for your father in heaven perfect that's why we always want to be perfect we don't want to be like somebody else also so but we want that god now yes man of god the reason she has now become a yellow bone all those things are men now they appear under what you call it now youtube marcos foreign [Music] [Applause] we the reason we left the sin naked it is because we are predestinated that's the reason we left sin younger the reason we left hairstyles this is that to search and sound because we are predestinated the styles that's what i want to be like the ego logo is the following like jesus who would you say no jesus all right now you watch them right when they are here but they're in your lives is a message that is come amen now let me continue and but finally they came forth upon the earth at perfection let in that man hey what does god see when the only image of god is within you logan um amen because god looks at it amen god did not look at you god did not look at them but he said a bow in the sky and the bible says looked upon the ball you know what because the ball is easy is the token or the covenant okay where is it brother do you know genesis chapter 9 yeah god don't look at you [Music] [Music] is it the starting point is verse 11 the starting point start where where come down in all thy house unto the ark for they for they have i seen righteous before me in this generation by seven [Music] they've got their own means of doing things singing also of the seventh [Music] [Music] to keep the seed alive let me come to this verse verse 4 all right oh they said this three of force also of the air by servants and the male and the female to keep the seed alive just that is how it it is put by how god puts it then chapter 9 verse 11 and i will establish my covenant with you pegani you know before god can do with you he has to establish a covenant first [Music] working like that get back online the system is already there it's hysterical the currency yeah the comment [Music] get online and god said this you watch the token which i made any sense and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and you that's why brother branham says god is likened like a a rainbow you're gonna keep and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant which is between me is [Music] [Music] that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the the earth that's when i look upon the the pole [Applause] christ who christ and he is a soul god don't look at me brother prophet that's why today i know when he looks at christ christ christ christ christ the mystery of god reveals unto christ amen today god can see you just as plain as sound and now lastly uh padong all right yeah now let's come back to this this is my book here what's this book the masterpiece you want the masterpiece finally listen to page 10 paragraph 47 masterpiece finally they came upon the earth a perfection and that was a man what would say governor you know adam was god's is so he doesn't look at dusty his creator word [Music] every time god would open his eyes see god [Music] second which is evolved but yet the image in the mirror is not myself myself is inside of me but peeping out of my pocket in the face now when i'm looking at you all right amen yeah with the body can sing songs of worship um [Music] [Music] he that's [Music] [Music] okay i've got another one i've got another mighty god i will find it it is just here in the mighty continent uh i'm going to just read so that i can finish quickly almighty god page 14 two
