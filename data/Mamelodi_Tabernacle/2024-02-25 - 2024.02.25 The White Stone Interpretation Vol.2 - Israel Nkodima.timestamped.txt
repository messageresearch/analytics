[1:57:24] everywhere I go yes
[1:57:33] people if you
[1:57:37] open up
[1:57:40] there things
[1:57:42] like YouTube and
[1:57:46] things really in state of watching the
[1:57:49] people portraying
[1:57:51] themselves you find
[1:57:54] that the
[1:57:57] talk they are talking about the coming
[1:58:00] of the
[1:58:03] Lord I
[1:58:05] believe there are some people here who
[1:58:08] are already
[1:58:12] in sometimes even yesterday I was just
[1:58:18] saying I'm so glad to preach to the
[1:58:23] people whom I see as even my future
[1:58:30] family the
[1:58:33] people will be with
[1:58:39] me actually it's not future for these
[1:58:43] people were there in the mind of
[1:58:48] God before before the foundation of the
[1:58:51] world that's why he said you are
[1:58:55] sealed before the foundation of the
[1:58:59] world so I'm glad that I I'm amongst the
[1:59:04] people who shall never taste of death
[1:59:12] amen death is not for your
[1:59:16] children but it is for the body
[1:59:20] the body carrying us will surely
[1:59:24] die but ourselves we have another
[1:59:29] body waiting
[1:59:32] Yonder the souls already have picked up
[1:59:37] the type of the
[1:59:39] body that when we leave this body we
[1:59:42] shall
[1:59:43] enter into that
[1:59:46] body where we will know
[1:59:50] the
[1:59:53] P we will see the universe Hall not as
[1:59:57] we see it from where we are
[2:00:01] now because all things
[2:00:05] there our eyes will be able to see and
[2:00:11] we will
[2:00:13] recognize these things that were formed
[2:00:16] before the foundation of the world
[2:00:20] there's some people among us some are
[2:00:25] sick but you left
[2:00:28] Heaven came down when you saw you saw
[2:00:32] the
[2:00:34] condition that we were found to be
[2:00:37] in shed your own
[2:00:41] blood you were without
[2:00:44] sin amen The
[2:00:47] God Who translated himself yes sir Chang
[2:00:52] himself into a man like
[2:00:55] me to come
[2:00:58] and fellowship with me on
[2:01:02] Earth and he told me that by his
[2:01:06] stripes I was
[2:01:09] healed if you are sick this morning by
[2:01:12] his
[2:01:13] stripes you were
[2:01:16] healed accept him and say
[2:01:20] I believe
[2:01:23] you people can believe one
[2:01:26] another but what
[2:01:29] more if people could believe in the God
[2:01:34] who created
[2:01:37] them you are so wonderful Hallelujah
[2:01:41] even this morning as I
[2:01:45] pray in Jesus Christ's name
[2:01:50] bless the souls
[2:01:53] amen bless the word amen we are about to
[2:01:57] partake of as I
[2:02:00] pray it's a wonderful day Amen in Jesus
[2:02:04] Christ name
[2:02:11] [Applause]
[2:02:12] amen h brother read for us amen God
[2:02:16] bless you
[2:02:17] Sister
[2:02:20] read us the same
[2:02:23] scripture Revelation chapter 2 verse
[2:02:28] 17 he that have an ear let him hear what
[2:02:33] the spirit sayth unto the churches to
[2:02:36] him that overcometh will I give to it of
[2:02:39] the Hidden man and will give him a white
[2:02:42] stone and in the stone a new name
[2:02:45] written which no man knoweth saving he
[2:02:48] that receiveth
[2:02:49] e amen amen amen you may be
[2:02:56] seated uh for this few
[2:03:02] minutes it
[2:03:08] says
[2:03:15] brother
[2:03:17] uh
[2:03:19] let me
[2:03:21] he it says
[2:03:23] he he that have an ear let him hear what
[2:03:27] the spirit sayith unto the
[2:03:30] churches you know it says he that
[2:03:34] has not not
[2:03:39] ears because SE in God you've got only
[2:03:47] one amen amen
[2:03:50] one
[2:03:53] year one hearing
[2:04:01] faculty I don't have you don't have two
[2:04:08] years for the word of
[2:04:11] God In God we have only one
[2:04:17] year one
[2:04:21] message that is in
[2:04:23] God In God we don't have
[2:04:28] messages we have a
[2:04:33] message he has become our
[2:04:39] message that's why the Bible
[2:04:42] says he who has an
[2:04:45] ear let him hear
[2:04:51] what the
[2:04:54] spirit says unto the
[2:04:57] churches all right amen so then we I
[2:05:03] will give
[2:05:06] him a White
[2:05:09] Rock White
[2:05:14] Stone uh the color white is the original
[2:05:18] color
[2:05:22] understand white white that's why we
[2:05:25] sing white than the
[2:05:28] snower than the
[2:05:31] snow and uh now I will finish up
[2:05:37] what the part that
[2:05:40] we brought to you last
[2:05:45] week for few minutes
[2:05:52] then we will
[2:05:55] close not the
[2:05:58] service but the
[2:06:01] time here to
[2:06:04] continue the time of a son or
[2:06:10] daughter is not a limited
[2:06:13] time for the Bible says you have
[2:06:21] time
[2:06:26] etal a a person who has eternal
[2:06:35] life
[2:06:39] etern uh I believe we only
[2:06:44] understand what the word Eternal
[2:06:47] means
[2:06:52] because God is
[2:06:57] eternal amen that's why when God
[2:07:02] speaks like he
[2:07:06] spoke Ephesians
[2:07:11] 4: you
[2:07:14] listen
[2:07:16] God sometimes we we say let's meet for a
[2:07:25] topic then as human we talk about
[2:07:29] things but next time we
[2:07:31] change something
[2:07:34] else next time we change to
[2:07:37] something but you listen when God
[2:07:42] speaks he
[2:07:46] speaks another language
[2:07:49] let's he the language it
[2:07:52] says and grieve not the holy spirit of
[2:07:55] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[2:07:58] of redemption amen right you know when
[2:08:02] is the day of
[2:08:06] redemption that is the
[2:08:09] day the book is
[2:08:13] open amen because those whom he has
[2:08:18] preached
[2:08:20] destinated for
[2:08:23] Redemption their names were
[2:08:26] written in the
[2:08:29] book of the
[2:08:32] Lamb amen
[2:08:34] amen God also has an
[2:08:39] office everything in God is
[2:08:45] registered those that are going to
[2:08:47] heaven
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:49] already are in the
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:53] book registered
[2:08:57] already amen amen and the Lord
[2:09:02] said
[2:09:03] by their
[2:09:07] works you'll see
[2:09:10] them amen amen now the book says grief
[2:09:16] not the Holy Spirit
[2:09:20] continue grieve not the holy spirit of
[2:09:23] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[2:09:26] of redemption right amen unto the day of
[2:09:33] redemption now the I look for that
[2:09:36] day which day is the day of
[2:09:40] redemption and it says it is the day the
[2:09:45] book of
[2:09:46] redemption is open
[2:09:51] amen amen amen and
[2:09:54] uh you see your
[2:10:00] name now the name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:10:05] Life is not that like the name
[2:10:13] registered uh in a at a certain
[2:10:17] School
[2:10:18] office or
[2:10:20] workpl no the book in the in the L
[2:10:27] book The L's book
[2:10:31] of
[2:10:34] life amen amen amen uh you hear
[2:10:39] sometimes they speak about life
[2:10:43] insurance insurance insurance life
[2:10:46] insurance but it this
[2:10:51] life only we give you that
[2:10:55] name life the real life is
[2:11:01] God amen amen amen that is
[2:11:05] life now we were
[2:11:11] born
[2:11:14] birth is when you are being introduced
[2:11:20] amen
[2:11:22] amen
[2:11:24] when a woman is
[2:11:29] expectant no one
[2:11:33] knows who is coming but we see that
[2:11:36] somebody is
[2:11:40] coming only
[2:11:42] God knows who is
[2:11:47] coming
[2:11:50] because babies are molded in
[2:11:55] heaven in
[2:12:00] God he is the one the author of
[2:12:06] life that's why I can't
[2:12:11] worship
[2:12:13] be created by by
[2:12:17] demon or created by an created by
[2:12:22] God Amen how can I worship something
[2:12:27] else unless I turn to the
[2:12:30] one who created
[2:12:34] me amen every
[2:12:36] morning I say this is another
[2:12:40] morning I'm still alive
[2:12:43] here because God has kept my soul
[2:12:50] that I should
[2:12:52] live amen amen so I can worship what
[2:12:56] they
[2:12:58] call what is called ancest it's happened
[2:13:02] like
[2:13:03] this when the
[2:13:06] Lord his body
[2:13:10] died
[2:13:12] because When They
[2:13:14] Crucified the Lord Jesus Christ Bible
[2:13:18] says his soul went
[2:13:25] well amen amen it went
[2:13:32] well yes
[2:13:35] am his
[2:13:38] duty because
[2:13:41] down there were
[2:13:44] some
[2:13:46] Souls
[2:13:49] now he had to go to
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:55] separate Souls from
[2:14:02] Souls there was a
[2:14:05] place where it was called
[2:14:10] paradise and the
[2:14:12] dead in
[2:14:14] Christ were kept in a place
[2:14:23] but when the Lord
[2:14:27] died it
[2:14:30] changed from
[2:14:33] Paradise
[2:14:38] di they were brought
[2:14:41] closer next to the seven
[2:14:46] Di
[2:14:49] amen amen now that's why he says the
[2:14:54] dead in
[2:14:55] Christ shall rise
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:00] first amen amen when you are dead and
[2:15:04] they say you are
[2:15:06] dead you died in the
[2:15:10] Lord your body it is your body that
[2:15:16] di for it says if you believe in him you
[2:15:22] shall never see
[2:15:28] death now if it says you shall never see
[2:15:33] death is not talking to the
[2:15:36] body the body because it's all flesh
[2:15:41] shall see
[2:15:43] death because it was
[2:15:46] born
[2:15:49] but
[2:15:50] you it's you and your
[2:15:56] body now your
[2:15:59] operation
[2:16:02] depends it CHS in which type of
[2:16:08] body are you
[2:16:12] operating if it is the body of
[2:16:15] flesh but who is in that body
[2:16:19] because if it is a child of God an
[2:16:23] eternal
[2:16:25] spirit in this body then you'll hear the
[2:16:32] language that the person in this
[2:16:35] body is not
[2:16:40] worth if he is from God for the Bible
[2:16:44] speaks of
[2:16:46] redemption
[2:16:49] now you know what is to
[2:16:53] redeem is to take
[2:16:55] something back to
[2:17:01] orig amen
[2:17:04] amen if you can follow the Book of
[2:17:08] Job he will tell
[2:17:11] you amen okay amen now because we just
[2:17:16] for a few minutes
[2:17:19] no the
[2:17:23] white
[2:17:25] stone there is one part in my book
[2:17:29] here it is called Blasphemous names
[2:17:34] Blasphemous
[2:17:37] names
[2:17:39] and this Blasphemous
[2:17:43] names this part in
[2:17:46] it
[2:17:48] page 18 where it
[2:17:51] says
[2:17:54] um it speaks of
[2:17:56] the confession
[2:18:01] here because you know all of
[2:18:05] us we will stand before
[2:18:10] him whether you are a
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:14] king will stand before
[2:18:16] you
[2:18:18] the
[2:18:20] Creator not by Dem not an I was trying
[2:18:24] to tell you to say
[2:18:27] something when the Lord
[2:18:31] died he
[2:18:33] sold went
[2:18:37] down down down
[2:18:40] down because they killed the
[2:18:43] body but they couldn't kill
[2:18:46] him
[2:18:49] amen because he is not that
[2:18:54] b amen when they kill the
[2:18:58] body Peter says his soul went
[2:19:05] down we have read about
[2:19:08] that when he was down
[2:19:13] there you know as Christian you you
[2:19:19] you've got that
[2:19:21] record of Jesus being
[2:19:25] born and you know you know when he was
[2:19:30] born it was
[2:19:33] Gabriel that came and said to
[2:19:38] Mary H blessed
[2:19:42] blessed among
[2:19:45] women she was chosen
[2:19:48] for a
[2:19:52] special Ministry
[2:19:55] of
[2:19:56] Joseph was set
[2:19:59] aside for God to bring his seat
[2:20:05] through and said Joseph Joseph although
[2:20:10] he didn't understand but he was set
[2:20:13] aside for
[2:20:16] Gabriel
[2:20:18] now Gabriel came
[2:20:20] in and said to Mary blessed are
[2:20:27] thou then when she he spoke to
[2:20:31] Mary Mar first didn't
[2:20:36] understand for he said I know not
[2:20:41] men I'm a
[2:20:45] vision and uh
[2:20:47] the angel
[2:20:49] said what you shall
[2:20:54] conceive
[2:20:55] is of the Holy
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:20:58] Ghost it has nothing to
[2:21:03] do with
[2:21:06] men it's not the seed
[2:21:10] ofen
[2:21:12] amen then when
[2:21:14] Mary
[2:21:16] believed amen and took the word of
[2:21:24] God in
[2:21:26] Mary that word became
[2:21:32] blood then when the angel
[2:21:37] left a a body
[2:21:39] started
[2:21:44] in for Jesus Christ didn't come to the
[2:21:49] body that came through
[2:21:52] [Music]
[2:21:56] Joseph he was the
[2:21:58] Christ that's why even before he was
[2:22:02] born
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:07] prophecies there was this woman
[2:22:11] suing
[2:22:13] around saying I know
[2:22:17] mesiah
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:22] coming
[2:22:24] before even Mary was noticed to be
[2:22:32] pregnant there was there were those who
[2:22:35] came with a
[2:22:37] prophecy I know
[2:22:43] mesiah and when he has
[2:22:46] come
[2:22:47] we will know all
[2:22:51] things you know right
[2:22:54] now we were told
[2:22:56] that when you die it is this body
[2:23:03] that but beyond this
[2:23:07] body you know in this body we need
[2:23:16] a
[2:23:17] to
[2:23:23] exploit now
[2:23:26] but in this
[2:23:29] body we don't see
[2:23:33] things we don't see far
[2:23:39] away we ended up with
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:46] glasses our sight is getting dim all the
[2:23:52] time but don't worry it is in this
[2:23:55] body but in that body you you

[2:31:20] is all right amen
[2:31:23] now before we
[2:31:28] close uh I was trying to
[2:31:32] say where is this what you call came
[2:31:37] from ancestors where is it coming
[2:31:40] from when Jesus
[2:31:45] died the Bible says Peter says he went
[2:31:49] his soul went
[2:31:53] down that's what he came
[2:31:56] from came for to
[2:32:01] redeem the Bible says he
[2:32:05] tasted death for
[2:32:10] us he overcame
[2:32:13] death in order for us also
[2:32:17] to overcome
[2:32:19] death our body will die but ourselves
[2:32:24] shall never
[2:32:26] die if you believe in him you shall
[2:32:29] never see
[2:32:32] death am it is your body that will
[2:32:38] die
[2:32:40] now the Bible tells us
[2:32:43] that he went down
[2:32:47] then the
[2:32:49] day he
[2:32:51] resurrected what
[2:32:55] happened
[2:32:57] some
[2:33:01] resurrected didn't the Bible
[2:33:03] say amen amen amen and they were taken
[2:33:09] with
[2:33:11] him because the first
[2:33:15] Paradise
[2:33:16] was of the blood of
[2:33:21] goats amen amen and but the second
[2:33:27] one which now we say the sixth
[2:33:31] Dimension he brought them to a
[2:33:34] place the Bible says when he rose
[2:33:40] again Graves were
[2:33:42] open
[2:33:45] amen
[2:33:47] Graves were
[2:33:51] open then the dead came
[2:33:55] [Applause]
[2:33:56] out those were of the first
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:03] resurrection and together with
[2:34:06] him when he was taken
[2:34:09] up you only know of him being taken
[2:34:13] up but that cloud that covered
[2:34:17] was The
[2:34:19] Souls of those who came out of the
[2:34:26] Grave amen amen that's why the Bible
[2:34:32] says he will come in the
[2:34:37] clouds it's not talking about that are
[2:34:40] with him but the souls that are with him
[2:34:43] they appear like
[2:34:45] CL
[2:34:46] [Applause]
[2:34:48] amen amen amen and they shall be
[2:34:52] taken they were when he came
[2:34:57] out and he woke
[2:35:01] again after his
[2:35:04] resurrection he was around for how
[2:35:09] long am 40
[2:35:13] days amen amen the one who
[2:35:17] died was
[2:35:21] around and there were
[2:35:24] Souls
[2:35:26] when on his
[2:35:31] resurrection the people of the first
[2:35:35] resurrection the Bible says they came
[2:35:38] out of the
[2:35:41] Grave
[2:35:43] am because each soul
[2:35:47] recognized its
[2:35:52] body am because when they died the soul
[2:35:57] went to
[2:35:58] God the body to the
[2:36:03] grave but the day of
[2:36:06] Resurrection that is when the
[2:36:09] soul
[2:36:11] recognized
[2:36:14] body and it comes the resurrection is
[2:36:19] when the
[2:36:20] soul comes into the
[2:36:23] body amen then is a resur
[2:36:28] resurrection amen all right amen and
[2:36:32] what
[2:36:33] happened after
[2:36:36] that uh you go to a
[2:36:43] medium because he he took his to

[2:37:27] the one who died his things were okay or
[2:37:32] not that's
[2:37:34] why that's why we go to Christ because
[2:37:38] he rose again
[2:37:41] amen

[2:55:25] killing because the Bible says the love
[2:55:28] of money challeng is the
[2:55:33] root the
[2:55:36] root of
[2:55:41] what the Love of Money
[2:55:47] a mother a man can
[2:55:51] kill his
[2:55:53] child just for

[2:56:35] of this is a funny even if you can say
[2:56:39] to a person brother the Bible says the
[2:56:43] love

[2:56:59] please as you see
[2:57:02] me is
[2:57:05] blinded by this

[2:59:36] [Music]
