[1:05:26] revelation
[1:05:33] when he said something in this nature
[1:05:38] the Revelation Genesis Genesis tells the
[1:05:43] beginning the beginning revelation

[1:05:56] amen amen so that's why our theme
[1:06:00] because we're going to look into the
[1:06:04] back side
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:10] because this is now the end time

[1:07:38] he said the revelation of the Seven

[1:07:46] is actually to reveal what was there
[1:07:56] what was it
[1:08:02] amen amen
[1:08:04] and like we take the scripture again
[1:08:10] and then
[1:08:13] first John
[1:08:16] chapter 3.
[1:08:20] just let us take this one again there
[1:08:23] Epistle of John
[1:08:27] chapter one yes
[1:08:33] that which we have seen and had declare
[1:08:37] we unto you that ye Also may have
[1:08:40] fellowship with us all right
[1:08:43] that which we have seen I repeat I've
[1:08:46] been reading it time and again
[1:08:51] example and they have seen
[1:08:57] declare
[1:08:59] we unto you
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:04] amen amen and then they declare
[1:09:08] unto you declare we unto you that he
[1:09:11] also may have fellowship with us so you
[1:09:14] also may have fellowship with us
[1:09:22] okay I mean now before I write I just
[1:09:25] read some a few things here
[1:09:30] the the prophet reads
[1:09:33] uh this way
[1:09:36] Satan will attack the Book of Genesis
[1:09:39] now
[1:09:47] but I want to come to this
[1:09:50] place where he says
[1:09:54] this book
[1:09:57] is made for a certain class of people
[1:10:00] reality
[1:10:05] every time God would bring a message
[1:10:13] that's for a certain class okay
[1:10:31] received by a certain class
[1:10:38] is that right I mean that's why I'm
[1:10:41] going to look at the back side
[1:10:51] it has been spoken of for many many
[1:10:54] years
[1:10:59] but the hidden part
[1:11:04] is this one here yeah
[1:11:14] but you come to Revelation chapter five
[1:11:21] what does it say
[1:11:23] Revelation chapter five
[1:11:25] verse 1. 1
[1:11:32] okay this book is
[1:11:38] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:11:41] said on the throne a book written within
[1:11:44] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:11:46] silver men
[1:11:50] foreign
[1:12:03] okay
[1:12:05] this book okay
[1:12:09] was in the hand of
[1:12:12] Adam
[1:12:16] okay maybe yes diet we will look into it
[1:12:22] what the prophet says
[1:12:30] can I repeat something here
[1:12:36] Prophet preached a message
[1:12:42] standing
[1:12:44] in the game
[1:12:47] is there any person in the world who
[1:12:51] understands what does that means
[1:12:57] because he go
[1:13:00] support
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:05] there was a gap
[1:13:08] when Adam forfeited the book
[1:13:14] and then there was a game
[1:13:18] has left his position
[1:13:35] uh to get the way of the Tree of Life
[1:13:46] tree of knowledge
[1:13:51] that's why you see the message of this
[1:13:54] message
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:23] in the book
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] um
[1:14:28] the
[1:14:30] way he says
[1:14:33] you know the book I'm referring tonight
[1:14:41] he says
[1:14:44] then
[1:14:45] the word linked to
[1:14:48] please now in the bride listening
[1:14:53] which book
[1:14:55] spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:15:01] he was sent to bring the way to
[1:15:05] be around
[1:15:11] there's a man that was sent to send the
[1:15:15] word to the bride
[1:15:25] so when he met
[1:15:28] who's that Rebecca
[1:15:34] he spoke to Rebecca
[1:15:39] and you know what happened already
[1:15:42] then after Rebecca has received the
[1:15:45] message
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:50] the messenger
[1:15:53] LED Rebecca to Isaac
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:04] Rebecca remained on the back of uh
[1:16:07] common Rebecca
[1:16:16] until he saw Isaac
[1:16:23] then when he saw Isaac she saw Isaac
[1:16:28] she got off the camera
[1:16:34] she didn't remain on the back of her
[1:16:36] camel while Isaac is there
[1:16:44] right of Christ also
[1:16:47] because they come when she she comes and
[1:16:51] see the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:16:56] foreign
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:14] the book is made for a class of
[1:17:18] people okay for a certain classes
[1:17:25] now I will read just few things here
[1:17:30] uh now
[1:17:35] we call him a brown remita Abram
[1:17:40] now
[1:17:42] talking about the Seed of Abraham
[1:17:48] the Seed of Abraham the Bible says is
[1:17:51] Christ
[1:18:00] and now in this last days
[1:18:05] we see how a brother Brennan spoke of
[1:18:09] Abraham and his seeds
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:15] and we have read it I think it's a
[1:18:18] previous week
[1:18:23] that Abraham when he saw
[1:18:26] him
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:30] there's a time when he saw he met
[1:18:33] Melchizedek today
[1:18:38] no the prophet says
[1:18:40] all the attributes
[1:18:44] will do this oh God will do the same
[1:18:47] thing
[1:18:56] in the last days
[1:18:59] all the attributes
[1:19:15] the mind of God
[1:19:19] has to meet God
[1:19:31] then he says that is what all the
[1:19:36] attributes
[1:19:39] shall do in the end time
[1:19:49] now this king of Salem because the Bible
[1:19:52] says was God
[1:19:56] and he became Jesus
[1:20:00] and the LC became
[1:20:04] the problem
[1:20:07] that's how it is put here in the book
[1:20:10] who is this melchized
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:27] he said
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:32] well he said
[1:20:35] let me read it for you
[1:20:39] he met Melchizedek
[1:20:45] okay I mean
[1:20:48] it's a bit quiet here
[1:20:52] If Abraham met him
[1:21:05] it is for the seed of God okay
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:21] now the true revelation of Melchizedek
[1:21:28] comes into view
[1:21:32] was that foreign
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:22:06] amen amen now we can read on and on
[1:22:13] we will read this pattern because we we
[1:22:16] will have another part for tomorrow the
[1:22:19] Lord willing
[1:22:24] I mean now I read you can part again
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:38] but
[1:22:40] where is the Royal seed of Abra Imam
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:51] where is their sign is
[1:22:57] where is their signs
[1:23:03] that he said as it was in the days of
[1:23:07] Sudan
[1:23:10] God came down and was manifested in
[1:23:13] human flesh
[1:23:20] as Sarah was thinking back in her heart
[1:23:25] a water says
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:31] saw
[1:23:33] he's driving it back again
[1:23:39] brother
[1:23:45] to show the sign what happened
[1:23:53] and he took a how God came to Abraham
[1:24:02] and
[1:24:04] he prophesied a prophet
[1:24:08] because Sarah was on the back side
[1:24:13] but the God prophesied
[1:24:17] and because Sarah loved
[1:24:22] and God said why did Sarah Sarah left
[1:24:28] is there anything hard for God
[1:24:33] amen I mean at the time of life
[1:24:39] I shall return
[1:24:41] your wife shall have a son
[1:24:46] um
[1:24:56] showing the people that what happened
[1:24:59] back there
[1:25:03] he said the sign foreign
[1:25:43] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:25:48] meaning that the sign of Abraham
[1:25:52] when God could prophesy
[1:25:56] when Sarah was on the back side
[1:26:01] he did the same thing
[1:26:06] I mean and they said
[1:26:09] this day literally is this
[1:26:17] what
[1:26:18] libertarian is fulfilled
[1:26:22] meaning that that sign of Abraham is
[1:26:26] here with us
[1:26:30] okay amen now now before I close foreign
[1:26:44] God came down
[1:26:46] and was manifested in human flesh
[1:26:54] and they told what Sarah was thinking
[1:26:57] back
[1:26:59] our Buddha says
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:07] and
[1:27:08] the last sign before the Gentile world
[1:27:11] was destroyed by fire seek out some of
[1:27:15] those
[1:27:19] foreign
[1:27:37] something
[1:27:38] like this is
[1:27:40] you know it's all this then
[1:27:43] the last side the last side
[1:27:55] the book was in the hands of Adam
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:03] I don't know if in
[1:28:06] the difference
[1:28:10] but when Adam forfeited the book s
[1:28:22] because
[1:28:24] the book called hookah in that book
[1:28:28] there was
[1:28:47] I mean not elsewhere
[1:29:00] I will try it again maybe for the last
[1:29:03] time
[1:29:08] Hobby
[1:29:10] what it meant now is
[1:29:17] the prophet says more than men were one
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:24] and because now there is a law of
[1:29:26] restoration there should be one again
[1:29:37] it was not a place
[1:29:42] it was a place for men for the men
[1:29:46] so are we there together
[1:29:49] now the restoration would not put a
[1:29:52] cherubim there
[1:29:55] the restoration has to put again a man
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:03] if you know the law of restoration
[1:30:20] now he's ready let me put it to you like
[1:30:23] this
[1:30:26] reason why the sword
[1:30:33] what was the reason
[1:30:36] when God gave
[1:30:38] a brother Branham
[1:30:43] what was it foreign
[1:30:48] foreign
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:33] so a God
[1:31:36] kicked him out of Eden
[1:31:41] and place the
[1:31:43] a
[1:31:46] the cherability
[1:31:50] I mean
[1:31:53] but that was not the place for sharabi
[1:31:55] Empire
[1:32:00] that's why the law of
[1:32:02] options
[1:32:04] I had to bring back men again
[1:32:14] foreign
[1:32:22] here we are
[1:32:24] now
[1:32:26] yeah it will cause
[1:32:28] problems to those who are not there
[1:32:35] when brother Brendan received that sword
[1:32:38] okay
[1:32:40] the question is what foreign
[1:33:08] that's now closing the game
[1:33:26] now he came in as a substitute
[1:33:36] now he says
[1:33:39] now
[1:33:40] he came
[1:33:42] to uh and a Sprinkle blood across
[1:33:51] you know when when there is a gap
[1:33:57] foreign
[1:34:00] why the blood of that blood is for
[1:34:05] Redemption
[1:34:07] to redeem is to bring back
[1:34:12] now God
[1:34:19] knows
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:32] he had to come and close the game now
[1:34:41] although
[1:34:44] we were talking brother left and out
[1:34:46] left and right
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:56] receive the message
[1:35:07] okay now he he says
[1:35:11] here he came as a substitute
[1:35:20] his blood
[1:35:22] um
[1:35:27] the word Redemption means bringing
[1:35:32] back
[1:35:38] all right
[1:35:39] amen bringing back
[1:35:44] bringing you back
[1:35:46] bringing me back
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:51] that is redemption
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:57] if the Gap remains
[1:36:08] alone
[1:36:12] America
[1:36:22] now he says he sprinkled blood across
[1:36:29] the girl mostly
[1:36:32] that is redemption
[1:36:35] that's why because
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:58] and they went
[1:37:04] they went
[1:37:07] you check it we will check it now very
[1:37:09] well
[1:37:11] because he says worry they went I won't
[1:37:14] say east or west but they went where he
[1:37:17] opened the book for God
[1:37:27] oh man I mean because they you are the
[1:37:31] children of one God I want you to find
[1:37:33] that whether he went west or east and
[1:37:37] give it to me
[1:37:44] all right now
[1:37:47] is there somebody who can see
[1:37:50] the sword
[1:37:53] now brother Brendan says
[1:37:57] yeah
[1:37:59] that's right
[1:38:01] later when it was revealed to him
[1:38:13] amen amen amen you all know about them
[1:38:16] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:21] we still have to look into it because
[1:38:24] it's two books all together
[1:38:29] in the Book of Life
[1:38:44] are going to judgment
[1:38:49] that said God's prophets
[1:38:55] in the book of life
[1:38:58] you are judged according to your works
[1:39:01] yeah
[1:39:04] that's why the sleeping Vision
[1:39:08] the Bible says
[1:39:11] they will also receive White
[1:39:14] but of the world
[1:39:18] because
[1:39:19] they were judged and they were found
[1:39:23] worthy to receive
[1:39:26] white ropes
[1:39:31] and plainly it says those whose names
[1:39:35] were not found in the Book of Life were
[1:39:37] casting the Lake of Fire
[1:39:51] you you
[1:39:53] he has already judged you
[1:39:59] and found you to be
[1:40:01] holy
[1:40:04] um
[1:40:07] that is the bright in the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:10] Life
[1:40:16] we can still look at that it is in the
[1:40:19] book
[1:40:20] those in the Book of Life
[1:40:24] a prophet of God says
[1:40:29] to judgment
[1:40:33] amen you know when they were coming from
[1:40:36] the tribulation
[1:40:37] periodically
[1:40:41] and they ask who who are this
[1:40:46] because John could recognize the 144
[1:40:51] 000 to be the Jews
[1:40:58] but he didn't know these others
[1:41:02] because they were gentiles
[1:41:07] and and they said Barry this came from
[1:41:11] the Great Tribulation
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:26] is this the bride
[1:41:31] foreign
[1:41:37] but when the Revelation struck him
[1:41:42] he said no no no no no no
[1:41:45] it can't be the bride
[1:41:48] the pride is not coming from the
[1:41:51] tribulation
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:41:55] amen you see the difference
[1:42:00] foreign
[1:42:03] those that are coming through that
[1:42:05] tribulation periodically
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:13] 144 000.
[1:42:15] which you've seen last time that at the
[1:42:18] end they become the eunuchsia
[1:42:26] during the
[1:42:27] Millennium Millennium
[1:42:30] they come there as the eunuchsia
[1:42:35] foreign
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:18] now let me repeat to you again
[1:43:21] I will read that part to you tomorrow
[1:43:40] in heaven
[1:43:43] amen amen
[1:43:45] that now when the seals are opened we
[1:43:50] were opened up
[1:43:57] just look at past the curtain of time
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:04] now he says I will read it to you
[1:44:08] tomorrow
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:21] they're better now in casually will be
[1:44:25] fought beyond the curtain of time
[1:44:27] equally once
[1:44:30] now because it was fought beyond the
[1:44:34] curtain of time
[1:44:41] it is there
[1:44:44] was a battle in heaven this
[1:44:48] battle was in heaven
[1:44:51] amen amen amen that was before the the
[1:44:55] kitten of time
[1:45:01] that's why it says
[1:45:04] Michael and his angels
[1:45:09] it never
[1:45:11] foreign
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:10] amen yes but after the tribulation
[1:46:17] oh okay we'll check tomorrow again
[1:46:21] when it is
[1:46:44] the prophet was asked
[1:46:56] he said after
[1:47:00] direction now
[1:47:05] if then
[1:47:06] the King of the North
[1:47:10] started to move now
[1:47:13] showing their sign now the battle of
[1:47:16] Armageddon
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:22] that shows that
[1:47:25] is
[1:47:32] you know how close is the rapture now
