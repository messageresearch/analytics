[23:46] um
[23:47] a page of mine here is 4.99.99
[23:54] and paragraph important I will
[23:59] take the paragraph from 8 22 to 8 22 we
[24:05] have read this even recently yes
[24:10] and
[24:12] the prophet speaking here
[24:18] do you remember it
[24:20] God was this great big Fountain of
[24:24] sir
[24:31] seven colors
[24:35] and
[24:37] you know
[24:39] he calls it uh
[24:44] these seven colors
[25:18] and he says eating
[25:21] uh
[25:23] God was this great big function of seven
[25:26] colors
[25:29] [Music]
[25:31] how many knows that he says
[25:34] and how many knows that God has seven
[25:36] spirits
[25:39] that is in the Bible
[25:42] absolutely seven spirits and there were
[25:46] seven eyes
[25:51] but uh
[25:54] what makes it so important to us
[26:00] and he says
[26:02] so so forth all that
[26:07] who's coming together
[26:10] all right yeah amen amen and that's why
[26:14] hello
[26:16] we don't call him today seven spirits
[26:21] because he says
[26:23] all that things
[26:26] coming now together
[26:31] now
[26:32] uh you are a
[26:51] is coming together when
[26:54] [Music]
[26:56] uh it has come together
[26:59] it will be called
[27:01] I'm looking here
[27:04] you know
[27:06] when you are looking at that
[27:09] that's a man
[27:13] too
[27:23] and the Lord God also go through as it
[27:27] says it he was the seven
[27:30] colors
[27:32] of the rainbow
[27:34] but now today
[27:39] is coming together
[27:42] now
[27:43] a mere a man cannot see him in that form
[27:48] um
[27:55] [Music]
[28:19] um
[28:19] became
[28:29] [Music]
[28:32] [Applause]
[28:52] [Music]
[29:36] all this is coming together
[29:45] how he
[29:47] dwelt in there in the man I am doing and
[29:52] they're coming through some Supernatural
[29:55] stages
[29:58] like of the seven colors
[30:02] now we see him today
[30:05] not as seven colors but I'm reading here
[30:11] it says
[30:13] now well well now hold on on to this
[30:20] all that is coming together now
[30:24] this was preached many years ago
[30:29] all right then now if you take the Theo
[30:33] funny
[30:36] okay
[30:38] now when he the logos went out of God
[30:45] which was God coming from
[30:48] this one big Fountain
[30:52] into a body
[30:56] in the form of a man
[31:00] so when he came in this form
[31:04] it was from the Fountain of seven colors
[31:11] it made the logos
[31:14] which we call yes
[31:18] now if you take the fuel that's your
[31:21] funny
[31:22] when you are looking at that that is a
[31:26] man
[31:42] no differences
[31:45] if we could meet
[31:47] as lead
[31:50] ers
[31:54] now because
[31:56] we meet
[31:58] and some are
[32:11] [Music]
[32:14] foreign
[32:22] [Applause]
[32:40] amen
[32:53] foreign
[33:13] [Music]
[33:28] [Music]
[33:34] [Music]
[33:40] [Music]
[33:49] [Music]
[33:54] I'm not preaching to the message that is
[33:59] the bride
[34:02] amen amen because I don't know which
[34:05] mean Ministry or where they made that
[34:08] particular church
[34:12] I know the bride is the word of God
[34:16] that's why I preach the bride
[34:22] the word
[34:24] so if you preach the prize that's why
[34:28] the bride will keep on saying amen
[34:31] amen amen you preach the bride
[34:35] which is the word it is
[34:45] all put together
[34:48] we call it the bride of Christ
[34:53] amen amen and when Christ speaks to you
[34:59] he speaks to the word
[35:02] that came from him
[35:05] that's why the the word he has spoken
[35:10] cannot deny him
[35:14] God spoke you into existence
[35:18] you exist because he exists
[35:26] [Applause]
[35:28] amen amen he has made you a revelation
[35:33] I
[35:47] am so he has formed you
[35:50] and they made you a revelation
[35:53] you can't believe the things you can't
[35:57] believe that you are a revelation
[35:59] unless you are a revelation
[36:05] is
[36:07] the Living God
[36:11] The Living Word of God
[36:13] not a quotation
[36:15] some people are going around with the
[36:19] quotations
[36:20] and they are taking them into different
[36:23] ways
[36:25] what we need is not a quotation
[36:30] that life himself
[36:33] because the Bible says
[36:37] [Applause]
[36:39] he has made us
[36:45] where is that scripture
[36:48] I'll come to that scripture in Hebrews
[36:54] because as the prophet says
[36:58] we are him
[37:02] revealed
[37:04] [Applause]
[37:05] mm-hmm
[37:08] you are the revealed word
[37:11] you can't believe
[37:23] where are you
[37:25] is that right
[37:28] and my brother was telling me that
[37:33] because you know the Lord Jesus asked
[37:36] the disciples
[37:38] who do men say that I the son of man am
[37:42] but okay
[37:45] [Music]
[37:55] [Music]
[38:04] and of course there was a pause
[38:07] until Peter opened his mouth
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] Chris too
[38:19] so how did Peter know that
[38:23] it is like this woman here I
[38:27] I heard something I was reading here
[38:31] of this woman
[38:33] and the summer written women
[38:38] you know this woman uh
[38:43] I I I I will read this part here
[38:46] about sister
[38:49] [Music]
[38:52] read you from this part
[38:56] foreign
[39:13] with
[39:14] Clinton Moses Moses
[39:18] when the people come together
[39:24] to be prayed for that's what I
[39:26] understand
[39:27] and
[39:29] one absolutely hits the spot
[39:34] you know
[39:36] whose God you come
[39:38] and hit the spot
[39:43] I mean so now if you hit
[39:47] the spot whatever turning down
[39:49] men like Peter you know so
[39:53] they did hit the spot
[39:57] then Wendy Peter hit the spot how Petros
[40:01] were coming down then he said what is
[40:06] what did he say what do you need
[40:11] Christ said to Peter who created
[40:22] foreign
[40:29] [Music]
[40:47] [Applause]
[40:56] then he said upon this road to Allah not
[41:00] upon Peter I hope he's got pets no Upon
[41:03] This Rock yes I will build my church
[41:10] it reminded of that
[41:13] architect
[41:17] we are told that
[41:20] and there's a man who wanted somebody
[41:23] foreign
[41:28] [Music]
[41:55] early they ended up
[41:58] seeing at the center level
[42:05] down you must read the spoken words
[42:11] that
[42:12] they tried some Baza because they were
[42:16] offered
[42:18] many a reward foreign
[42:45] foreign
[43:13] all right
[43:13] behind descent
[43:19] yeah
[43:27] as a builder
[43:29] that one when it's a true story
[43:33] that one went down
[43:36] he also arrived at the scent level
[43:41] now he rejected is it as a foundation
[43:49] the prophet of God says the men knew
[43:53] that is
[44:01] a man
[44:03] so he went deeper
[44:05] he arrived at where the other people
[44:10] could not go first
[44:13] you know just like that even this
[44:16] morning
[44:17] there are some people
[44:19] who cannot find the rock
[44:23] because Christ is the rock
[44:26] that's why I say Rock of Ages
[44:32] some people come
[44:34] but they can't find that they can't
[44:37] arrive at that room
[44:41] if all the people
[44:48] we wouldn't be having some pieces of
[44:52] changes
[44:56] because if we find a rock that is
[45:03] foreign
[45:18] [Music]
[45:31] I mean yeah you know we know
[45:34] even if Satan come to tempt us
[45:39] we know that fears behind this Satan
[45:44] there must be life
[45:47] there is
[45:49] Satan cannot beat me
[45:52] behind him
[46:06] let me hide myself
[46:12] you know
[46:15] a true Christian um
[46:17] will pass all the Temptations
[46:24] He
[46:26] must find a place
[46:29] [Applause]
[46:31] not where you are prayed for every day
[46:37] that's when you come to a place
[46:40] amen amen they call it a resting place
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:46] I mean amen

[49:48] they are doing this and this and this
[49:51] amen is
[49:58] oh let us finish
[50:01] that man that daughter
[50:04] the first thing he knew yeah
[50:09] that's the first thing
[50:12] so
[50:13] that knowledge given to him
[50:17] [Music]
[50:19] there is there must be a Rock Amen
[50:26] he started from where the others have
[50:28] failed
[50:30] to dig going down
[50:42] then brother Branham tells you the story
[50:51] a bridge
[50:57] I was reading then Fonda where the
[51:01] prophet of God
[51:02] said about the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:05] that when he died
[51:10] and
[51:12] you know why he died yes
[51:16] it was not a tragedy
[51:22] he was supposed to die according to his
[51:25] own plan okay
[51:29] he wanted to go down
[51:33] amen amen so that's why he came
[51:38] and when he died the Bible says he went
[51:42] away
[51:45] foreign
[51:56] foreign
[52:32] because he says when he was
[52:34] down there
[52:39] he could
[52:40] he had the other part of
[52:45] okay
[52:48] I mean because men are failed
[52:55] and that's why we have standing in the
[52:58] Gap
[52:59] really yeah uh you'll realize now before
[53:04] we finish and then people don't know the
[53:07] what it means standing in the game
[53:11] they just read about it I don't actually
[53:15] know what it means
[53:18] and somebody tell us
[53:20] standing in the gap for who am I to be
[53:24] because there was again
[53:27] and somebody was supposed to come down
[53:37] forfeited
[53:41] when he left that place
[53:46] he left again
[53:48] because God and Men
[53:55] the first thing you see he says let us
[53:58] make men
[54:00] in our image
[54:05] is a part of the threefold revelation of
[54:08] God
[54:10] now we wanted men
[54:14] [Applause]
[54:17] [Music]
[54:27] since it was in his mind
[54:32] and when Adam forfeited
[54:36] and then God come with the law of
[54:40] redemption
[54:42] to redeem to bring it back again
[54:48] otherwise it will remains
[54:53] they will say God once made a man
[54:57] he failed that man failed again
[55:03] tried to make somebody like him
[55:06] now God
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:10] came with the law of re
[55:13] Ward
[55:15] to bring it back again
[55:19] what I want to do I'm going to do yes
[55:24] if God wanted to make me a Christian
[55:32] God will still succeed
[55:39] he comes with the law of reproduction
[55:44] bring it back again
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:53] that is the god whom I worship
[56:01] me yet
[56:08] Jesus
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:11] [Music]
