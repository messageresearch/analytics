a p for us this morning that's why we are here with confidence Worship You may we bless our pastor and the that he you are waiting upon your word anding that this is the moment that you speak to us we

s here for wa in Jesus Christ amen you may be seated my mic is not working uh the Bible speaks of the manifestation of the sons of God and brother BR says that is the time when the sons of God will be a God now this morning I want be long I'm going to be very brief will as we have another activity this after now I'm going to read some few things here uh from the books of our Prophet amen and I believe they will bless us amen now the book The Mighty God unveil before us am says I was wither before thetics in Acts chapter 2 sorry in the book of Acts chapter 2 he says I was with Peter means I was identify because this morning we just want to identify ourselves oh my God and all right let me okay whener preach I was identified yes sir and chapter 4 when they assembled together I was with them when the building shook after the prayer meeting the building where they were set I was identified with them amen I preach with Paul on M Hill I was with John on the AIS of petm and I've seen the second coming I was with Luther in the Reformation I was with wesleyy and he continues and here I am tonight 1964 in Philadelphia Philadelphia p identifi with the same group and with the same kind of an experience I must be to be a Christian I must stay identified where the word of God is being manifested Jesus means you are not he is not just identified anywhere at a certain where the way of God is made man am and so was I with brother when he preached we were identified you know why me and the pastor are pastors this morning it is because when brother preach we were we were identified there and now here in the year 2010 with the same group and the same experience are we now being identified am it's still the same thing am the same experience the same the same group so see then I look for what is what does the weight mean manifest um now before I go to this let's check here you know in the book um the spoken is the original seat amen p p 29 the prophet says here is the word yes the word that God spoke the way that God spoke to multiply and replenish the it couldn't find a place oh my God finally this way it caught in the womb of a vision am as we are going to identify ourselves but only where the made am because you have the word and the manifestation of the word now this morning I've got to find the right place you find the right place in the message because there is some places in the message but I must stay identified in the right place amen the right place is where God comes uh for to himself brother says in another book here he says when God takes his position because God also has a position amen amen and we worship him in his position sometimes he is the father sometimes he the son sometimes he's a so him in his John 14 the Lord Jesus said believe in the father believe also in me amen am believe in the father and the father was now in the son believe also in me because before a worshiper can worship he must first find the object of worship you can't worship without F or finding the object okay now let me read when God ever takes his position in the human heart a position in the human heart all the reasonings fade away that means God has to find a position amen amen and I must find a position in the message there is some position and some places now it depends in which position in which or a place do you worship am now brother says I must stay identified where the word of God is made but where the word is made now I ask brother about this manifestation now Christ is the Myer of God revealed now you realize here I say finally the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the Earth it couldn't find a place now we are going to look at thees God manifest himself in a certain place and there's a scripture again here think in the book of Hebrews you know God's places Hebrews chapter 4 verse 4 it say for he spoke in a certain of theeven day a certain place of the seventh day amen that means there was a place not speaking in all the places you know we there's so many message Believers this morning but there is some certain plac brother says God plac AB mes and some other in a certain place say he set them on a b where they could see east west south yes Lord and believe we believe that as children of God we should find the place where we can see so that we we can see all things God said to Abraham I shall not hide from Abraham the things that I do am he set him on a place where he could not bypass him Abraham knew everything that do and shows me that the word of God will be manifested in the bride carried the SE the message to the Bri Gabriel Carri the seed and the seated iny the seed is manifested in the bride amen so the Bride As the FI amen I will read here now it says I'm back to Hebrews chapter for he spoke in a certain Place only those in that certain place he him speak a certain place of the seventh day in this way amen God did rest the seventh day from from all his and in this place again you know it's in a and verse again he limited a certain day saying in David hu together saying in a place in David that means God spoke in David hallu now I will stop the prophet say the word that God spoke couldn't find a place finally this way it C into the wom of a vision that means from the garden the word was traveling coming to it place as a until found a place Mary all right God just spoke it and before it could germinate the serent and he caused a hybrid and that word kept on traveling to place woman because brother tells you that the the the the groom the bridegroom tree without the Bright Tree canot bring FR it must find the female now now I will turn to this now me here what is where is the place of manifestation and he says that is where he is he stays identified not where there's questions when they were waiting when they were waiting in the upper room they were not asking questions God said to them wait so waiting never ask any questions and suddenly there was a sound where they were waiting now a promised child wait wait for the promise promise to him Amen in the right place now brother says let's look at the manifestation God and the man was one he says this this is God's great mystery that is Page 64 God and man was one there and God and man is one amen amen so because God don't change his pattern if he was one there then at the end time God and man is one because is the restoration God and isn't it wonderful they were one I will say to you brother and God were one you and God are am God deals first with one man bring fors so he deals first with one with if you can say to me brother is I will amen first brother he deal with one says is now in the same God was is now in you he deals first with one man he was in one Jesus then he was in the apostles he was in one Elijah then he was in Elijah one brother many amen amen and now it says God and Men I love this because God is a man we read the other day and what it is being filled with the spirit him having his prein that was God's achievement that's purpose he might be in Christ and Christ in US it doesn't remain with him only in Christ but it is now Christ in us as he said at that day you shall know that I am in you okay God was coming down to his place he just don't change God in that is his manifestation so the world the whole creation was waiting for that what was W for for God to come to his place the Book of Revelation it says God is with his people that's why this morning there is this confusion among the people some believe that the Lord has come some believe that he is coming coming amen am there was this man brother bam speaks about uh Albert Einstein Albert Einstein Al Einstein he he was asked the question by some other scientist because Einstein had uh some telescope and his telescope was Advanced compared with the other telescopes now they all probed the universe ining the universe each and every one would come with a conclusion each and every one of the would come with a conclusion but you know with the universe the more they discover something the more they see some other so it is just not ending so that's why Einstein made a better telescope he invested one he invested a better telescope now they came to him and asked him they said what is the answer because they discover some other stars only to discover that there is some other stars so there was no conclusion now the answer of alstein he said to them we shall never never h
