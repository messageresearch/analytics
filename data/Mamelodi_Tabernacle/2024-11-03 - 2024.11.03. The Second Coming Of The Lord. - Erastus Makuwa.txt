Description:
Title: The Second Coming of The Lord
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa on 03 November 2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

I Thessalonians 4: 13-18 | Malachi 3: 1 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the second coming of the Lord.

We have three comings of the Lord. The first coming is when He come to redeem us. The second coming is when He comes to claim us and that is in the rapture. 

God is perfected in three. The third coming He come with His bride to rule in the millennium.

When the Angel met the virgin, it was the secret meeting known only by the virgin. That was the start of the process of the coming of the Lord.

We meet Jesus in the air before we get home. You cannot meet Him if you have not met him supernaturally. 

He appeared to Abraham and said He is coming. When He came Sarah was pregnant. Abraham and Sarah were expecting a promised son. Today our promised Son is the rapture. 

In Thessalonians 4: 6 the shout is the message which we have, and the voice; is the voice of resurrection which is in us already.

The people who opened the sixth dimensioned are the old testament saints. 

When He comes, He will move from the seventh dimension to the sixth and take all the saints which are in their theophanies.

When God gives us part of Himself He must give us our theophanies. The anointing now is above the seven church ages. It is the Logos anointing. Now we ask if you have met Melchizedek and not the holy ghost, because it is the time of meeting Melchizedek.

The opening of the seals is the opening of Christ. The opening of the seals is bringing back our theophanies. The seventh seal is the ministry of the bride.

morning we just want to stand against the wrong nature the nature that is against the will of the Lord there Bible says what I want to do I don't do and that that I want don't want to do that's what I do because Lord there is a wrong nature that Paul spoke about that there are two Natures that are fighting from within gracious Lord we pray for the nature of Christ in us because without the nature of Christ we can say that we are ready and we are lying to ourselves each and every one of us we know that we've got situations that we are faced with but gracious Heavenly Father you have said those who will overcome gracious Lord they shall inherit what you have placed for us Lord in heaven gracious Lord we pray for the service this morning thank you Father for the brother who's leading us with songs gracious Lord he was just reminding us Heaven that where we are coming from the Bible says we are the alpha and the Omega there's something that we have heard that we have seen that we have touched with our hands because we were there H you just processed us father to be born gracious heavenly father father but we like to thank you that your blood has managed father to wash everything that was not going right so that the nature of Christ should be the one that will stand forever we pray for the Perfection of your bride this morning we pray father for those who are eager doing right this morning those father we have come in they've got different problem as soon as they are inside here Lord already we have already answer to them we pray for the running of the service we pray gracious Heavenly Father for our precious pastor we pray gracious Heavenly Father for the items and we pray gracious Heavenly Father for our brothers and sisters who are in their positions this morning that whatever they do it has to be done knowing that father we shall answer one day about the position that you have been given thank you heavenly father as I pray and casting out all demons casting out Devils casting out out witch and wizards casting out father those who are against this service in the name of Jesus you Satan I command you by the power that has invested in us as the sons of the most high God we say this service it will be led by the commander chief which is is Christ himself thank you Heavenly Father we pray for the word as my father the man of God that we have prepared this morning will come we pray for him father that you Lord let everything father be done which is coming from you Lord this is the only pulpit and the pulpit father that has been Lord spread

for like to greet the Saints in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen uh it is always a privilege and an honor Amen to to stand before the children of God opportunities like this we we do not take them for granted amen because sometimes issues of life may cause you not to come amen so David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord because in the house of the Lord there is fullness of joy there is the presence of God and where the presence of God is [Music] so B I was listening to the prayer of the Elder Almighty the commander and chief is here uh I had asked for a scripture in the Book of Job I won't belong I promise that that I won't belong amen so that scripture in Job chapter 9 verse 32 and 33 if maybe the brothers can help sorry not to rush you Brothers um the song that I'm about to sing is connected to the scripture amen hallelujah I don't know if the brothers are able to display Job chapter 9: 32 and 33 I promise to keep time amen oh it's there already oh I'm looking at there sorry sorry brother amen uh sorry I'll have to tell amen cuz I need to read yes for he is not a man as I am this is a man what that was speaking out of frustration and stress amen not knowing why am I judged condemned attempt broken but the second verse which is 33 as we read on on 32 it he's not a man as I am that I should answer him and we should come together in judgment but the second verse brothers and 33 yes and it says neither is there any DeMent between us that might lay his hands upon us both to me that scripture speaks of John 3:16 God coming down as a man and also as God two Natures because the man that was needed here was had the capabilities of laying his hands on men and also laying his hands on God so that there should be peace and connection between man and God hallelujah so we thank Baba that prayer as you said the Chief the Commander in Chief is here that is that is why even this morning even when choosing a pastor we we have to be careful because we need a man who has two Natures to connect that which is in heaven and that which is on Earth the Commander in Chief amen he is with me everywhere and he knows my every care and I as happy as a and just as [Music] free for the reason for me please yes the secret that is this that the comforter abides with me for he abides Hallelujah he abides yeah hey Hallelujah he

amen what is doing I I tell myself that I must do it let's read the book of Let's Start From My Brother start from verse 13 vers 13 we shall be first Thessalonians chapter 4 from verse 13 M but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him amen for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and REM remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words um I would like perhaps to talk about uh his second coming ums I will just touch some few points there then I believe I will because I am I'm always here with here then I will continue but let me just H start something let's Close Our Eyes father thank you for this privilege thank you for giving me this time I'm standing in front of these men and women of God Amen Sons and Daughters of God yes you are the only one who is who should stand here and preach to them I'm not worthy but they have said I must stand in front of them and they are happy for me to stand in front of them bless them bless me thank you bless my brother use our voice I pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we may take our seats when I was here I preach about meeting madc in our days uh let me just read something here what I have read um it's the book of who is this me page 20 I read paragraph 105 notice after the battle was over MC Serv his Victorious child communion think of think of that part of himself he said this Victorious ch with part of himself what is part of himself part of himself is the word of God part of himself is the [Music] theop our Prophet say here because he has preached the message with this he says here in this book I read in the middle there I want to uh but then but I met MC he gave me communion and since then it was settled forever if if he gave Abraham and that communion was part of himself and if he's giving brother he must give him the same thing we are let me let me just go on a little remember at this time the communion had never been instituted not until before the death of Jesus Christ hundreds and hundreds of years later but MC after his child Abraham had won the victory met him and gave him wine and bread showing that after this itly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take communion again I it will be the wedding serath I will not I will not drink no more of the vine and eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you I new in my [Music] father is that right notice again said when to meet Abraham before he got back home what a beautiful type here we have me meeting Abraham before he got back home after the battle we meet Jesus in the before we get home that is right the second tells us that we meet him in the air a beautiful type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field we meet him in the air as we have read second Thessalonians we have three comings of the Lord the first coming of the Lord it was when he come to redeem us you know about that that was the first coming and the second coming of the Lord it was when it was when he come to claim us that is the second that is what we call the Rapture that is his second then the third coming let me just read what the prophet everything travel is in three with god god is perfect in three first coming of Christ to redeem his brother second coming of Christ to receive his bride the third coming of Christ coming with his bride to rule in the Millennium everything runs in three are you together hallelujah amen he has come to redeem us now we have got a promise that you will come again to us are you together but we know that to understand his second we must look at his first coming then if we can look at this first coming then we shall understand his second because first coming when we read Mal 3 in other scriptures but let's look 3 ver1 can read my brother my brother is not here not doesn't matter can you read it Mal 3 3 ver1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prep prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come said the Lord of hosts amen he's talking about the messenger coming before him to forun his coming and he says the Lord whom you are looking for will soon come to his temp there were there are other scriptures which were talking about his coming and the children the people there the Jews there they were looking for his Com when they were looking for his in the different synagogue in in the in the temple they were singing about him coming they were happy expecting him to come but while they were still singing and happy about him something happened my brother the angel met the vision it was a secret meeting known only by the V and they their talks when they were communicated at the end of their talk said let it be done unto me as you are sa and the angel left it was the start of the process of the coming of the Lord no one was aware of that they were singing in the temple just like now people are singing in different places waiting for him to come some say they're waiting for the Rapture but they didn't know the processes because in the first coming the vision made the and in the second country VIs because it is the same process after the vision has made who was mared he got she got pregnant she knew she was pregnant from the way our Prophet said to us the W is in the just like it it means the bread has met the angel because for the way to be in Mary Mary the angel Mary for the way to be in maryy received the angel then when the prophet says the weight is in the bride just like it was in Mary is the brightest Med and the brightest received the weight from amen that was the process of his coming when we read verse 13 to 17 is when John because John was his for when he was baptizing there way it came there when it came there there was a men there that man was the son of Mary he was born from Mary but when he was there then when he wanted to be baptized by John was baptized by John the the weight came down the pillar of fire and when the pillar of ours came in it was the Fulfillment of Malachi chapter 3 it was God whom they were looking for coming to his Temple then we have got processes we have 10 ver 1 talking about the angel coming down with a book open book and we were T that he took the book and gave to the seventh and we are told when this Angel come down there was another man just like when this when come John was here then when this man come there was another man [Music] Amen to receive [Music] that those this thing the prophet says I don't say he is coming I say he is here what is happen these are the processes leading to his second coming it is not his second coming it is the process leading [Music] to we have got 14 the in the evening these are the process this is the Supernatural coming because you cannot you cannot meet him if you have if you have not meet him super you must meet him super you must meet so that you can meet you meet so that you can meet you cannot meet me this superal coming the prophet calls it his [Music] appearing let me read something here per about these things here um I'm going to read in this book here same thing today when you see his work now we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the Lord now remember appearing and coming is two different ways appear then come now is appearing he has already appeared in these last days he appeared to Abraham and said to Abraham I'm coming amen when he come Sarah was pregnant Abraham and Sarah were waiting for the promised son Isaac our promise son is and before Abraham could receive his promise amen and he said to Abraham I'm coming can you put something here when the Bible says here verse 16 Thessalonians for the Lord himself I said I will come back here I just touch something amen he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archel with a with a TR of God the chist shall arise all these things he has descended with these things amen are you together shout is the message and the message the voice is the voice of Resurrection amen the voice of Resurrection amen are you together you see when he he will move from the seven Dimension and went to the six and pick the Saints there and come down with them and leave him in the and they will come down here I've had ELD told you about that he he told you about that he said we will meet them here amen we shall see them amen the people who opened the sixth Dimension are the Old Testament sints hey do you believe that all right if you don't believe just follow it because he died and he resurrected when he resurrected he resurrected with those you know about that the Bible says so and people show them when Heise when he ascended up he ascended up with them and he left them in the sixth di the ones who opened it first people [Applause] who who were in the first in the six di then from there after Pentecost there are Saints who died they they joined them there then from the first church age there there the first the second the Third they died them until the seven the age we are living in I told you physically are living in now year but we are we are [Music] above when he will move from the seventh and went to the six and took all those things they are in their theop and they will come down to the end to come to take another body because you have got three types of B this is the body then the body number one is called terrestrial then you have got the second one which is the theop then the Saints who have died they are in their theop there Hallelujah when I said when Abraham Met m this is this is this is the age the age of the revelation of the white stone now the stone which was not brother went to the west to connect with hisop amen do you know know that all right if you don't know it just listen he he said that there was an angel there a notable when we read the books he was a flying interpretation but when you read chapter one we are told about an angel who was telling John all these things John even tried to worship that and the angel said I am one of one of the prophets don't worship me and when we follow that danger we find it there that is the the theop of the man when God gave him he must give him the theop when God gives us P he must give us the are you listening you see people talk about receiving the holy the anointing now is above seven Church the anointing now is the anointing of the logos have you in the early ages they would ask you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe but now it's no more the case now have you received have you [Applause] met that is that is this we ask if you have met because this the time of [Applause] meeting when the seals were open amen because brother had to meet with the supernatural with the theop so that he can bring down because opening the is opening Christ and that's why when the SE were open John said I might have seen beyond the K of I saw John [Applause] there because opening the seals is bringing back our theop is bring is bringing back part of God where is of because part of God is the way the are the way of God in this age you should have received your the because the prophet says when you receive the we you are receiving the CES building up to your theop because when they come when they come they come in their theop and they found us here in this but only those who have got the theop in them they will connect the theop you cannot connect with these ones if you don't have part of them you must have received your see will finish and when this body finishes then we together we shall take other bodies I said is this one terrestrial and glori which are going to wear them during Rapture when those brothers and sisters come in their theop then we also we shall change but we change if we have God [Music] if I'm here with in me there is nothing there is something then will change I will I will wonder what is happen [Applause] the seven SE is the ministry of the [Applause] [Music] Bride nobody can understand onlyy understood the message of during that time it was the Super Natural Things the Shepherds received a message Sim receive Mage you will never die until you see the consolation of it was the message of Supernatural going to the Super even now this message it is the message of the Supernatural and it goes to the supernatural [Applause] Hallelujah if you are not part of the supernatural you'll never understand this FLH something there let me finish here I said they will come back God willing God will yes we have talked about this thing now we said after the B Abraham met after and we have said chch ages are grounds and then we we are above of the seven churches we know each and every messenger comes at the end of the age to call people out of the age in our messenger also the messenger came at the end of the age to call us out we are not in means confusion they don't they are they are blind they are not hot they are not C they didn't know themselves they don't know how to wear they don't know what sex they are but they because they are mad you see that is you find a pastor with to marry the two people been therey they they don't know the they are naked but don't know during this time the the messenger came to call you and me to come out out

marriage known only by the husband and the wife after be married sorry after being married then we go to the mar is what is happening people don't know you know let me just read this to show we are in another age we we shall come back now with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that are promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age for it it for tells us the author has
