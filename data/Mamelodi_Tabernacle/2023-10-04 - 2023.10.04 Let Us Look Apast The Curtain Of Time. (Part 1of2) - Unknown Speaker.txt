TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen amen God bless [Music] Church nowor said then we can now take take it from here again now we want to take uh this part uh as we continue from where we left yesterday amen and this part where brother BR uh he said of looking up he says let us look past the K of [Music] time so we are going to stand up again for the reading of the word h that will be Revelation ocy turn also to2 you can write that down we are going to read also Revelation 10 ver 1 to4 for the reading of the word heav father we are so thankful again you are always awesome in this place and it is not in vain that we are back here this morning and we believe that we will leave this place again and blessed people the world may not know us but your people know us because they know you so bless the word as we are just about to read and see and may every brother and sister listen with his or her heart Revelation 8 verse1 [Music] [Music] apy Revelation 4 verse 1 10 [Music] okayy voice amen markk verse 32 [Music] amen amen you may be seated so we thank the Lord for the reading of the word and uh we'll take from the prophet amen you know as we said the prophet is a messenger he brings the message to the people amen amen now not only to for us to [Music] Pro okay now the seventh SE the Bible says silent amen amen and that's what brother says it confused the enemy because Satan is lost them Satan will always operate after God have done something Satan is just an [Music] impersonator unless God say something Satan has got nothing to say he will wait until God says don't eat from this tree then Satan hear that thing then he comes and say and gives you an inter to you what God but if God can put a tree there and keep quiet Satan has got nothing to say that's why seal is quiet now Satan has got nothing to say amen and now look into this for a few minutes and firstly firstly when the L took the [Music] book he came down with the book amen am and he he never said anything he came down with the book but to the seventh messenger you know even if you read back in the Book of Genesis uh you you you look at was it the seven [Music] man and God says walked with God because he is the seventh men from and he erected the pyramid he build the pyamid and even the scientist of today cannot interpret the pyramid the seven steps inside to the king's chamber the seven steps inside the pyramid going to the king's [Music] chamber ited the bride the church because the bride the church is seven steps to God now it is en Enoch made that structure that is brother says that is the sign left pyramid pyramid is the sign of En the seven and was only interpreted by the seventh angel [Music] messenger it is brother who now interpreted the pyramid because he is the seventh angel [Music] messenger and was the seven man so you must find your now we have two books here H in one book and now we are going to for few minutes looking at the back side of the book The s seal SE is the [Applause] side nothing is [Music] written it is the back side so the back side there was no writing on the back side that the that is revelation 8 verse1 nothing written no sign you hear nothing when the SE was open but it says silent in inen amen so that's why they stopped because God was doing something that was very strange to [Music] them now the book belong to Adam you all know [Music] so it and God took it [Music] back amen so all this time it was on God's Throne waiting for Redemption of to bring back again to his position amen so all this time the the book was upon God's throne and the Lord Jesus Christ second he came now brother says he is the second husband of the [Music] second ever amen amen am and now he stood there as a [Music] mediator amen now there is something very strange [Music] here he speak as a mediator uh throughout the seven Church ages uh Seven Ages yes yeah this is a French [Music] pyamid uh7 ages or you say Church ages Seven Ages or we say seven Church ages now the Bible says in the book of Hebrew Jesus is the mediator of the new [Music] T which the seven changes fall fall under the the the the the New [Music] Testament it is the system of God in the the old God had had a system in the old that was your saath saath was the seventh day so the children of Israel were given six days to do their work and on the seven day was theath now the sabath was the day God would come and introduce himself but they couldn't see him on the seventh [Music] day that's why still blind now we have one 2 3 4 now seven days amen seven days he is the mediator he died he died now before he died he was not aiat he was the son of let me repeat again before he died and rose again he was not a mediator he was the son of [Music] men not the Son of God Son of he died again he became the Son of [Music] God is the Holy Ghost and he became a mediator mediator of Ephesians tell you that when he rose again he ascended up to the highest heaven and took his position at the right hand of the majesty and if you look at the right hand if you look at the right hand [Music] from as the Bible I mean in the bible he took the book from the right side amen then he had the book in his right hand and he came down with the [Music] book the right hand and he gave the book to the right hand of [Music] brother for [Music] brother said that is the sword of the king later later on was revealed to him that it's a book that the [Music] book Jesus took it out within [Music] himself the ration of Jesus Christ so he brought that Revelation down and it became a book [Music] in now this book was never written age was never written it was not in a book form because when John tried to write he said don't write [Music] in where he says of the day of his coming no one will know only the father because that is after the Lord lamb left theu so the lamb stood there after his resurrection and but at the opening of the he left that [Music] place no long [Music] [Applause] medior he wasi the seven church at the end of the churches he took the he came down and that's why the Bible says no one knows but only the father not even the son because the sunship is been taken away [Music] the is taken away so it is the father and the subject that's why the Lord Jesus says the true worshipers shall worship the father TR now I will say to you many people even in sou Africa they claim to worship God because God is an object of worship but if it says worship the father not everybody can worship the father takes the je of the [Music] father right all right now that's why everywhere even this morning people are preaching everywhere whether it's doing the church or what the church but they [Music] to because a a son is part of his father that's when we come to the blood l [Music] [Music] you worship God not like others but you worship God as your [Music] father says you can see the word make manifest says that you have seen [Music] have seen [Music] father the Bible it shows that his children have seen him amen but there is some worshipers [Music] but there is his children amen a child is part of his father anybody can worship let's read one scripture here you know that scripture I'll go back to verse let's find John chapter 6 verse 44 [Music] 49 [Music] 49 [Music] all right did you see I think the the pastor would like love us to carry our Bibles every time amen and then some not to take in [Music] notes we can even at because your Bible is your sword so a Believer must keep his sword like a soldier that is the Bible if I come to church I must pick my Bible this is my soul amen all right now he says no can come to me except father it doesn't say God the Father who has sent me him and I will raise him up at the last day so no man can come to me father lordus came from the father so says and God came from the same [Music] place Jesus says no man can come to me except he's coming from the same place if if if he is from the Father which means he is from the spirit [Music] real those who will come to him will also be coming from the spirit real amen then he says it is written verse it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God [Music] every that and leared of the father come unto [Music] me he means that you can only come to him from the father that means you can come to him only if you were there with that's the only way you can come to him amen because your starting point determines your End Amen if you start in God you end up in God if you start in heaven you end up in heaven if you start in the church you end up in a church if you start in you end up in sin we started in in God that's why we are stronger than sin because in our pilgrimage are in a cycle of Eternity Satan canot stop [Music] us amen because we [Music] started now he say listen closely 46 not that any man has seen the father except he who is of [Music] God now the ising [Music] to people cannot see this message some people cannot see the message because they were not there amen because you can only see from there even the Book of John what the Bible says he who is of god amen amen amen now if I have seen the father I am not now trying to see him because I have [Music] seen I have seen father I'm not trying to see him now know [Music] book of joh First John that which was from the beginning of John that which was from the beginning I think is after Peter that which was from the beginning which we have are you [Music] listening that which was from the beginning now this is not the beginning of the Heaven and Earth but he referring to the beginning of the unfolding of [Music] God the unfolding of God in the beginning was the word the word was with God was God so God was coming down in three stages he became into the form of the [Music] word now he calls it the beginning now we have the beginning of Genesis which is the material beginning cre but in this of John beginning was the word this beginning was before the beginning of [Music] Genesis because he made the Heaven and the by his word which means the word was before beginning because he created by the word beginning later so it says that which was from the beginning we have he amen amen so you hear it because you have heard [Music] it the message we hear is the message we have heard the message we see the message we have seen amen because if you haven't seen it you can be toed [Music] about because you don't know you don't see it you know if you are looking for something that you don't see then somebody comes and [Music] say then he comes there the thing is not there no no no no no it is there [Music] once you see it then you will recite there because now you have seen it now the message is something that you must [Music] see hallelujah amen amen okay now now we let's pass this one but it says which we have seen with our [Music] eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have hand the [Music] of that's it so it's something that happened back [Music] there you know to restore you take something back to where it was to redeem is to take something back to where it was it's not it is not new there because it was there then it fell then now you redeem it back to that place again that's it now now now let's read here God bless you in in another book here the future home of the bright and the bright the future home ofde andde it says seven days deals with the old creation the world time and this is your seven days why it's called ages because ages that is seven seven days that is seven [Music] CH and he says and he says 8 Days on the day deals with the new creation which it deals with [Music] eternity so you have two things here as we which is with time now it's time and ET because in the book of Ephesians he said he will bring [Music] together that which is in [Music] heaven BR books two books one only one natural and the other part of it is [Music] superal now you yourself you areal and of superal the [Music] way amen now one part of you it's natural that cannot see [Music] God that's why you have the church ages and and the now when it comes to the [Music] seals you something here here himself here and he will tell us something about [Music] the [Music] amen page 567 amen P of the it says amen okay he says inde what is this what this great Secret thats benath this SE amen the [Music] secretay theeven SE what is that [Music] secret then he says I do not know that's before and he says I don't know I couldn't make but I know that it [Music] was close together seven different times and it unfolded into something that I have seen that I look for the interpretation so that is the end of the 1 2 3 4 [Music] 5es Jero Jero you know Joshua before they comp Jero of Jero he met a man with a [Music] sword now God said to them go round about seven times every day [Music] sh they take but on the seventh day he says to [Music] them [Music] s SE
