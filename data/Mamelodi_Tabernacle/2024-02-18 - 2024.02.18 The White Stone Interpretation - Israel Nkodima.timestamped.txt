[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:25] amen all right amen let's
[1:26:30] read uh the scripture with brother Gabon
[1:26:34] here Revelation 2 verse1
[1:26:40] 17 17 he
[1:26:43] that he that have an ear let him hear
[1:26:46] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:26:49] to him that overcometh will I give to it
[1:26:52] of the Hidden man and will give him a
[1:26:56] white stone and in that stone a new name
[1:26:59] written which no man knoweth saving he
[1:27:02] that receiveth it amen amen amen you may
[1:27:07] be seated God bless
[1:27:11] you
[1:27:16] uh myself I won't be
[1:27:21] long
[1:27:25] and
[1:27:27] so uh this is the
[1:27:32] word
[1:27:35] uh a quotation given to me by brother
[1:27:44] gabri is willing to come
[1:27:50] again he says
[1:27:52] if we can summon
[1:27:56] him any
[1:27:59] time uh he
[1:28:03] will Avail himself amen okay amen H
[1:28:09] given
[1:28:11] a he will be

[1:28:19] new amen all right amen
[1:28:23] say it
[1:28:28] brother and will give him a white stone
[1:28:32] and in that stone a new name written
[1:28:35] amen am okay amen given a white
[1:28:42] stone and in that
[1:28:47] name a new
[1:28:51] name
[1:28:54] I believe that the people who have now
[1:28:57] new
[1:29:01] names are not like everybody you
[1:29:09] see because they've got a
[1:29:17] new
[1:29:18] and they have received White
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:26] amen and we believe that this white
[1:29:33] stone uh with a new
[1:29:38] name it is a
[1:29:43] reflection so these people they have
[1:29:47] already
[1:29:50] received if
[1:29:53] we we were to talk about
[1:29:58] dimensions and we
[1:30:01] will you'll realize
[1:30:04] that the bride of Christ
[1:30:09] now uh is
[1:30:12] above all
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:19] Dimensions but we'll come to that
[1:30:25] if you
[1:30:26] were to look for the
[1:30:31] people that are going in the
[1:30:37] rupture I
[1:30:39] can we can look at the
[1:30:45] dimensions should you find
[1:30:49] one will come with that
[1:30:54] because not everybody is going in the
[1:30:59] rupture those that are going in the
[1:31:02] Rapture they are
[1:31:07] already amen amen in a certain
[1:31:17] place uh we
[1:31:20] have which one is God's Dimension
[1:31:27] Dimension oh the
[1:31:30] seven all right amen and if you are
[1:31:35] found to be reciting in some other
[1:31:43] dimensions will you be are you going to
[1:31:46] be taken
[1:31:49] up because you are not not in God's
[1:31:58] Dimension God
[1:32:02] operates in
[1:32:04] the you say the seven
[1:32:10] yes now let's look at
[1:32:13] it God operates in which
[1:32:20] dimension
[1:32:22] okay
[1:32:23] amen now that's why we
[1:32:28] are if you want to to
[1:32:33] know the people in the
[1:32:38] position the people are found
[1:32:42] in you look at the
[1:32:48] dimensions amen
[1:32:50] amen and the dimension the dimension
[1:32:56] uh where you find the the
[1:33:00] people who are going in the
[1:33:05] rupture will be taken from a certain
[1:33:12] Dimension because they are already
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:19] reciting in a certain
[1:33:25] Dimension so
[1:33:27] that they are
[1:33:29] ready to be
[1:33:33] taken now I'm going to read this
[1:33:39] thing uh it
[1:33:44] says I
[1:33:48] quote do you remember the pyramid
[1:33:52] of White
[1:34:00] Rock a pyramid
[1:34:03] pyramid you know pyramid pyramid is
[1:34:06] something
[1:34:09] where
[1:34:10] uh God used
[1:34:13] this
[1:34:18] pyramids a set of a place
[1:34:23] let me look at one
[1:34:27] here the pyramid
[1:34:31] pyramid you
[1:34:34] know I've checked this way and that
[1:34:40] way the seventh
[1:34:43] man was responsible for this structure
[1:34:47] the
[1:34:50] pyramid
[1:34:52] amen that's why all the people that are
[1:34:55] going in the
[1:34:58] rupture you you find them I'll show you
[1:35:03] in which
[1:35:07] pyramid okay
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:12] well there's some
[1:35:15] people that are
[1:35:19] talking about the rupture
[1:35:24] now it's not just something to talk
[1:35:30] about but it's something
[1:35:35] one finds
[1:35:41] himself having already
[1:35:45] entered in that Supernatural
[1:35:50] Zone
[1:35:52] oh H to be taken away in the twinkling
[1:35:55] of an
[1:36:00] eye because it
[1:36:03] says uh we have had Apollos and what
[1:36:09] else but none of them is faster
[1:36:13] than the Rapture in a twinkling of an
[1:36:20] eye
[1:36:24] and we look around and have
[1:36:28] seen all the events that the Lord has
[1:36:31] spoken
[1:36:34] of when he was asked about the end of
[1:36:37] the
[1:36:39] world and uh he spoke about the things
[1:36:43] that I'm seeing every
[1:36:49] day and
[1:36:52] that it shall be like in the days of
[1:36:56] Lord in the days of
[1:37:00] Noah all right amen but in in those
[1:37:06] days there was a a
[1:37:10] seed the seed of
[1:37:14] God and this seed of God was not part of
[1:37:20] those events
[1:37:27] the chosen
[1:37:28] ones now you you'll realize
[1:37:32] that the seed of
[1:37:34] God today is not
[1:37:39] part
[1:37:42] amen uh they don't dance for the worldly
[1:37:47] sounds and all
[1:37:50] that
[1:37:53] they are special
[1:37:56] people I'm trying to read something
[1:38:00] here
[1:38:03] and before we will come to the this
[1:38:10] Dimensions you know we have read
[1:38:12] something when the prophet said he spoke
[1:38:16] of the
[1:38:17] dimensions I don't know if you know what
[1:38:20] a dimension
[1:38:25] is now there are
[1:38:28] people
[1:38:30] uh
[1:38:33] residing in some Dimensions or a
[1:38:40] dimension already they are locked in
[1:38:46] there they don't even hear the word of
[1:38:50] God
[1:38:55] because they don't
[1:38:58] really
[1:39:00] uh operate or
[1:39:03] live they don't
[1:39:06] leave in
[1:39:08] the dimension of
[1:39:14] God the seventh
[1:39:20] seal all right am now let me read
[1:39:23] this
[1:39:26] uh Enoch
[1:39:29] Enoch and
[1:39:32] notice in the
[1:39:36] Zodiac it starts off
[1:39:40] with
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:44] vision the last thing in the zodiac is
[1:39:49] Leo the Lion
[1:39:52] the first coming of
[1:39:55] Christ through the
[1:39:57] vision and the second
[1:40:00] coming and it says now that's Leo the
[1:40:06] Lion of the tribe of
[1:40:09] Judah amen all right amen
[1:40:15] now let's look at
[1:40:19] this I have
[1:40:22] took down some few things
[1:40:28] here the people who will receive a new
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] name God won't call
[1:40:40] you by your Earthly old
[1:40:49] name
[1:40:53] why because that name
[1:40:58] isly and maybe you were named after your
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:07] grandmother and that's why people are so
[1:41:12] much
[1:41:19] ancestral uh there this word
[1:41:26] predestination if you are
[1:41:30] predestinated you can be
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:37] ancestral because you
[1:41:39] don't come from Goos
[1:41:42] and and you come from
[1:41:49] God you came from
[1:41:53] go so you can be
[1:41:58] ancestral if you are from
[1:42:03] [Applause]
[1:42:05] God uh you you look at the people
[1:42:10] today their
[1:42:15] nature you can look at a
[1:42:18] person and realize that
[1:42:22] this person has got
[1:42:25] something a certain
[1:42:31] Spirit and the spirit of
[1:42:34] God
[1:42:35] cannot dwell in another
[1:42:42] Spirit God predestinated
[1:42:47] you and uh in order
[1:42:52] to find he made himself a
[1:42:57] place amen a Dwelling
[1:43:01] Place in you amen that place is called
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:09] soul amen

[1:43:14] morning if God is not in your
[1:43:18] soul you can do anything
[1:43:23] you can even defy
[1:43:28] him because he is not in his
[1:43:33] place he is not there there's only two
[1:43:39] nature either it's of God or
[1:43:46] Satan and
[1:43:49] uh the tree is known by
[1:43:56] its
[1:43:58] okay every tree is known by its
[1:44:04] fruit you don't need to fasten I with a
[1:44:09] tree you just
[1:44:11] wait for the nature of that
[1:44:17] tree amen amen when it's summer when
[1:44:23] it has a a
[1:44:25] nature a nature that cannot be
[1:44:32] changed you know you find the
[1:44:36] people with a nature you can
[1:44:43] change
[1:44:46] really you know when God
[1:44:49] comes
[1:44:52] the first thing to
[1:44:54] do for God to dwell in
[1:44:58] somebody's
[1:45:02] heart he must be changed
[1:45:09] first otherwise if a
[1:45:12] person if God don't find a place in a
[1:45:18] person that person will still remain
[1:45:25] worldly amen the nature one
[1:45:31] change
[1:45:34] because in him is the nature of the
[1:45:40] world but that person can go to church

[1:46:19] nature now you look at the
[1:46:22] nature because you can't worship God and
[1:46:28] Satan it is

[1:51:57] met a
[1:52:00] preacher then we
[1:52:04] spoke but as soon
[1:52:07] as he turned away his back from
[1:52:11] me he scandalized to my
[1:52:17] name all right amen
[1:52:22] people hate us so
[1:52:26] much because some people scandalize our
[1:52:34] names okay but the
[1:52:37] Christian cannot
[1:52:46] hate that is not a Christian nature
[1:52:51] to hate is of the
[1:52:54] devil the Bible says he who hates his
[1:52:59] brother is
[1:53:06] like amen
[1:53:11] amen no no he said this this and
[1:53:14] this okay

[1:53:25] enjoy the word of
[1:53:27] God for the word of
[1:53:30] God speaks of
[1:53:34] us and speak to
[1:53:40] us amen amen if somebody
[1:53:43] says is this is what
[1:53:46] is that's why you don't hear me throwing
[1:53:50] stones
[1:53:53] and amen even the Lord Jesus
[1:53:57] Christ they
[1:53:59] said they call
[1:54:05] him you've never heard him say
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:14] same when they were judging they judged
[1:54:18] him he said father forgive
[1:54:23] them they don't know what they
[1:54:27] do
[1:54:30] amen he was feeling
[1:54:33] P that they don't know what they're
[1:54:35] doing now let's read
[1:54:37] this
[1:54:39] H you will receive a new
[1:54:45] name what did it
[1:54:47] say a new with a new name a
[1:54:52] rock okay Amen brother read it again I I
[1:54:57] want to look at something
[1:55:01] here he that had an ear let him hear
[1:55:05] what the spirit sayth unto the
[1:55:07] churches to him that overcometh will I
[1:55:10] give to it of the Hidden
[1:55:12] Manner and I will give him a white stone
[1:55:16] and in that stone a new name written
[1:55:19] amen which no man knoweth saving he that
[1:55:22] receiveth it
[1:55:24] amen he that
[1:55:27] has
[1:55:31] and
[1:55:33] yeah not this
[1:55:37] one
[1:55:40] because I was reading where the Prophet
[1:55:45] says he speaks
[1:55:47] of your theop
[1:55:52] he says those seven
[1:55:56] colors of the
[1:56:00] rainbow which was the Fountain of
[1:56:05] spirit
[1:56:08] condescended into a
[1:56:12] theop
[1:56:14] meaning if you can't receive or
[1:56:19] understand
[1:56:22] you can't
[1:56:23] receive uh you
[1:56:26] can't
[1:56:27] receive the
[1:56:31] seals seven
[1:56:34] things if you are not made of
[1:56:41] seven now the
[1:56:43] soul is made of
[1:56:47] seven which the seven rainbow
[1:56:52] colors that's
[1:56:55] God we'll read
[1:56:57] it God came from this
[1:57:01] Fountain of
[1:57:05] seven the
[1:57:08] rainbow the token of your
[1:57:12] Covenant the
[1:57:14] rainbow now not this rainbow you
[1:57:17] see but the rainbow of a
[1:57:23] spirit now you cannot receive
[1:57:27] seven
[1:57:28] unless there is seven in
[1:57:34] you now your soul is if it is from
[1:57:39] God it is
[1:57:43] seven that's why the message comes in
[1:57:48] seven seven Church ages s churches seven
[1:57:52] se you see to
[1:57:55] serve you your soul which is made of
[1:58:03] seven it is
[1:58:05] served by
[1:58:08] God it's 7
[1:58:13] to7 coming short of that you can do
[1:58:18] anything
[1:58:19] there are people living here that can do
[1:58:26] anything they can come to
[1:58:29] church and worship and do that after
[1:58:33] that they go to the
[1:58:34] world and do
[1:58:39] anything amen amen
[1:58:43] because God has
[1:58:47] selected some Souls
[1:58:52] you are
[1:58:53] blessed with a
[1:58:57] soul am that
[1:59:00] Soul coming from the Fountain of
[1:59:07] Life seven colors of the
[1:59:12] rainbow you've seen it in the
[1:59:16] Bible uh it was the token
[1:59:20] of the
[1:59:24] Covenant when he said I I shall set up a
[1:59:30] B in the
[1:59:33] sky
[1:59:35] why instead of God looking at
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:40] you he looks at the
[1:59:46] B then when when
[1:59:50] Israel was in
[1:59:54] Exile the Bible says God remember
[2:00:04] his Covenant was made
[2:00:09] of
[2:00:11] seven when he remembered the
[2:00:15] Covenant he sent
[2:00:18] Moses
[2:00:20] when he remembered the
[2:00:22] Covenant he sent Elijah the
[2:00:27] prophet knowing that he has the Covenant
[2:00:32] people they are not church
[2:00:35] goers they are
[2:00:40] called that's
[2:00:42] why they don't belong to the
[2:00:47] churches for God said to
[2:00:50] them behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:00:55] prophet he shall turn the hearts of the
[2:00:58] children to their
[2:01:01] fathers and brother Bram says to their
[2:01:04] pental
[2:01:11] fathers in the times of
[2:01:14] Paul
[2:01:17] Peter and
[2:01:19] in those in that
[2:01:23] time the church started
[2:01:26] there 12
[2:01:32] Apostles but when he comes to the
[2:01:35] Gentiles it speaks of seven Church
[2:01:42] ages okay
[2:01:45] amen
[2:01:47] now I will send you
[2:01:51] Elijah he shall turn the
[2:01:54] hearts of the
[2:01:56] children
[2:01:58] back the prophet says back to their
[2:02:08] Pentecost amen amen because on the on
[2:02:13] Pentecost they
[2:02:17] conceed amen amen and now and gave
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] birth when they gave birth here we have
[2:02:30] seven Church
[2:02:34] ages that's why
[2:02:39] Israel Moses and
[2:02:42] Elijah will appear
[2:02:46] there but uh
[2:02:50] he says it says it is
[2:02:56] Elijah this
[2:02:58] Elijah is coming is the same Elijah but
[2:03:03] he
[2:03:04] says he will come
[2:03:08] off off of the Gentile
[2:03:14] church but there for the Jews he will be
[2:03:23] Elijah from
[2:03:27] off because that is the
[2:03:33] Spirit uh There Was
[2:03:38] Elijah
[2:03:41] elah and then came elishah
[2:03:46] El and the spirit of elishah
[2:03:51] also the spirit of Elijah came
[2:03:54] to anointed
[2:04:00] elij and John the
[2:04:04] Baptist he came in the spirit of
[2:04:11] Elijah that's
[2:04:13] why uh he was responsible for
[2:04:17] introducing the
[2:04:22] Messiah and that spirit in the last
[2:04:26] days came
[2:04:28] also to
[2:04:33] forun which
[2:04:39] coming you don't know
[2:04:42] amen okay now the sister say the second
[2:04:47] coming mhm amen it must be the spirit of
[2:04:56] Elijah for the first
[2:04:58] coming of the
[2:05:00] Messiah and for the second
[2:05:04] coming is the spirit of
[2:05:07] Elijah
[2:05:09] amenu amen amen for elected
[2:05:16] people all right amen
[2:05:21] now let me show you
[2:05:26] something if
[2:05:29] Elijah did not
[2:05:36] speak there is where you know I I don't
[2:05:40] have it today
[2:05:42] here but brother Bram
[2:05:46] spoke of the dimension
[2:05:52] then it
[2:05:54] says he says of those
[2:05:58] Dimensions uh he mentioned something you
[2:06:02] know which dimension
[2:06:05] that that it shows
[2:06:09] people
[2:06:11] colors which
[2:06:15] dimension the fourth all right amen he
[2:06:21] says it choose it choose
[2:06:24] things it's
[2:06:29] radio all that is the
[2:06:34] fourth and God dwells
[2:06:39] in
[2:06:41] seven now the
[2:06:44] fourth
[2:06:47] dimension
[2:06:49] uh you find some
[2:06:51] Spirits residing in this fourth
[2:06:56] dimension they do not hear God at
[2:07:02] all they
[2:07:05] can't their
[2:07:07] Spirit are fourth
[2:07:12] dimension you can preach until you turn
[2:07:17] blue never change them they won't
[2:07:22] change now the Rapture is not coming to

[2:07:37] supernat it's for the people who love
[2:07:39] the
[2:07:41] world the things of the world and what
[2:07:45] the Bible says they will be lovers of
[2:07:48] themselves
[2:07:54] this that's why Paul
[2:07:56] says we preach these things to the
[2:08:04] perfect then the prophet of God tells
[2:08:07] you a perfect man or a
[2:08:11] woman who has eternal
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] life it says he is

[2:08:47] that
[2:08:49] uh the
[2:08:51] fourth
[2:08:54] dimension you find the
[2:08:57] people where it
[2:09:02] says the
[2:09:04] people are
[2:09:08] programmed in the fourth
[2:09:12] dimension but the children of

[2:15:56] white oh yeah here we are
[2:16:00] amen now in the
[2:16:05] pyramid I
[2:16:07] quote say is this the
[2:16:10] time is this the
[2:16:13] time it speaks of
[2:16:16] this
[2:16:20] when the prophet
[2:16:22] went
[2:16:26] West you know in the Bible man the
[2:16:30] Garden of
[2:16:32] Eden
[2:16:35] was
[2:16:37] East
[2:16:39] now every time he meets an
[2:16:46] angel he will say I went
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:54] West to meet an
[2:16:59] angel and those angels He
[2:17:02] says they were coming

[2:23:28] key I said they want to

[2:23:50] zound he used to walk around here sound
[2:23:53] gospel sound
[2:23:58] goel
[2:24:01] and he said to
[2:24:04] me the Bible speaks of an angel with a
[2:24:12] key and but then he Contin to say
[2:24:18] something which I
[2:24:21] cannot
[2:24:23] explain
[2:24:25] and not
[2:24:27] once and he repeated the same thing to
[2:24:32] another brother or
[2:24:38] brothers that angel with a
[2:24:45] key
[2:24:47] then the brothers went
[2:24:52] toland
[2:24:53] [Music]
[2:25:03] uh not yeah I
[2:25:06] mean no no no
[2:25:08] no
[2:25:10] okay because I will confuse you if I say
[2:25:14] cab amen
[2:25:18] and they were
[2:25:22] Inland and a
[2:25:26] spirit that confronted
[2:25:31] them didn't the spirit speak about that
[2:25:40] key and the spirit
[2:25:44] said what did the spirit say
[2:25:51] do you still
[2:25:54] remember okay let me let me tell you
[2:26:01] what what was that was it a
[2:26:04] m or what or just a spirit in a
[2:26:14] form maybe the brother can't recall
[2:26:18] right but they were there
[2:26:22] in when they were confronted
[2:26:26] by this Spirit at a certain River at a
[2:26:31] certain
[2:26:35] Bridge actually they were helping a a
[2:26:41] sister and they have to they went to a
[2:26:45] certain River
[2:26:49] Bri
[2:26:52] there when they were there they were
[2:26:55] confronted by a
[2:26:59] spirit but in a
[2:27:04] form of let me just say
[2:27:08] so and
[2:27:11] then that Spirit spoke of the
[2:27:15] key
[2:27:18] saying your pastor is
[2:27:24] refusing is refusing with the
[2:27:28] King can you recall
[2:27:33] brother
[2:27:35] right let's close here
[2:27:40] now
[2:27:42] H we we won't run it to the Finish
[2:27:47] but the thing
[2:27:52] is when I this part says here the seven
[2:27:59] seal is not to be known to the
[2:28:11] public all right amen there's a reason
[2:28:15] that's why you see as we will follow the
[2:28:18] White
[2:28:22] story that white
[2:28:26] sto then I
[2:28:29] continue with
[2:28:31] this in this part that is Page
[2:28:36] 575 page
[2:28:38] 575 he speaks of the junior Jackson
[2:28:44] dream J
[2:28:47] he says uh just like it
[2:28:52] said in junior Jackson's
[2:28:55] dream that the Lord let me
[2:29:04] interpret I think we are
[2:29:11] together
[2:29:12] because the ministry of the
[2:29:15] rapture it's not like
[2:29:21] saying stop
[2:29:23] drinking stop smoking and all
[2:29:26] that no is for the bride of
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:34] Christ
[2:29:36] amen to stoping does not make you a
[2:29:41] Christian
[2:29:43] amen so many
[2:29:45] people
[2:29:48] they quit
[2:29:51] smoking and still they are not
[2:29:55] Christians they are just
[2:30:00] nonsmokers if you don't drink that
[2:30:02] doesn't make you a
[2:30:05] Christian a
[2:30:09] Christian is not a
[2:30:11] nonalcoholic
[2:30:14] person a Christian a Christian is born
[2:30:23] again not only born
[2:30:26] again but have
[2:30:33] received you get what I mean amen now
[2:30:36] while somebody is shouting in
[2:30:40] spirit speaking
[2:30:42] tongues the Bible you open the Bible
[2:30:46] then it says
[2:30:48] behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:30:52] prophet then you read this for somebody
[2:30:57] who is speaking in
[2:30:59] Tong ring in
[2:31:02] spirit and he says behold I will send
[2:31:05] you
[2:31:06] Elijah the prophet because the
[2:31:11] word comes to the
[2:31:15] people
[2:31:17] in a prophetic
[2:31:20] form when he was born there was a
[2:31:26] prophecy as je has
[2:31:31] saidah that is the real word of
[2:31:34] God a
[2:31:37] prophecy being
[2:31:41] fulfilled the word of God the real word
[2:31:45] of God
[2:31:46] the real revelation of the word of God
[2:31:50] is when a
[2:31:51] prophecy is
[2:31:53] fulfilled P heart
[2:31:58] amen amen
[2:32:01] amen people read the
[2:32:05] Bible but when he was
[2:32:09] born the prophecy
[2:32:12] came Isaiah
[2:32:15] spoke
[2:32:17] a son is born unto
[2:32:22] us that
[2:32:24] was the
[2:32:28] prophecy now those who knew about the
[2:32:32] prophecy They Came To Worship some came
[2:32:35] with
[2:32:38] gifts appropriate
[2:32:41] gifts they followed the
[2:32:45] prophecy
[2:32:47] that the son is
[2:32:49] born on the day of
[2:32:52] Pentecost Peter said these people are
[2:32:55] not drunk with new
[2:32:57] wife a
[2:33:00] prophecy being
[2:33:04] fulfilled amen amen you know that's why
[2:33:09] it was not from the bible
[2:33:12] school it was from the
[2:33:14] prophet from
[2:33:19] God he said behold in the last days I
[2:33:23] will pour out of my
[2:33:26] spirit then when it was
[2:33:30] fulfilled Peter received
[2:33:32] it and said this is what the
[2:33:38] prophet that in the last
[2:33:40] days of of my spirit unto all flesh
[2:33:48] right amen God has put you
[2:33:52] here for
[2:33:59] judgment each and every one of you must

[2:34:17] [Music]
[2:34:19] you amen our God is like
[2:34:23] that you have heard but
[2:34:27] because you belong to another
[2:34:32] nature you can't
[2:34:36] receive the nature introduced by
[2:34:42] God people are ruled by Nature
[2:34:49] different
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:53] nature when the
[2:34:56] service as we are about to stop
[2:35:03] here before we leave here I can say to
[2:35:06] you where are you
[2:35:10] going all right

[2:36:09] something you know I'm preaching like
[2:36:12] this there is someone who will
[2:36:16] he is here he is going
[2:36:19] somewhere he's going to smoke
[2:36:26] marij what do you call

[2:36:33] nature a person who doesn't know
[2:36:39] God as I was saying to telling a brother

[2:37:06] share a person who has seen
[2:37:11] God will always
[2:37:14] share
