[1:06:33] We found a sister crying
[1:06:36] [Music]

[1:06:41] seat and she moved the
[1:06:44] Bibles and it has caused a

[1:09:36] opportunity so that we can forge ahead
[1:09:38] the goodness of the Lord.
[1:09:46] who is my elder son. The last time when
[1:09:49] I ended I end up saying my son my elder
[1:09:52] son
[1:09:53] introduced the message. He is the one
[1:09:56] who has introduced the message to me.
[1:09:59] blinded but I was blinded
[1:10:05] and I caused him a lot of problem
[1:10:07] because I know better than him because I
[1:10:10] always thought I knew better than him
[1:10:12] but
[1:10:14] unfortunately today I'm hearing the
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:18] message. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:31] Then there was a pastor which I used to
[1:10:33] refer to him as my father in the lord.
[1:10:39] I then said to to he must go to see that
[1:10:44] pastor so that he could understand if am
[1:10:47] I hearing correctly what is
[1:10:51] saying when he was
[1:10:54] back. I then called that
[1:10:58] pastor. He told me that has demons.
[1:11:03] I
[1:11:08] said there was something happening in my
[1:11:12] life emptiness in me. I felt a vacuum in
[1:11:18] me. Even when they were preaching where
[1:11:21] they where they where they were
[1:11:22] preaching where I
[1:11:26] was but I could not close the vacuum
[1:11:29] that I had.
[1:11:34] But I could not see that this vacuum was
[1:11:37] being brought
[1:11:40] by. I could not detect that is the one
[1:11:44] to close that
[1:11:47] gap because as it was
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:53] happening he told me that my pastor told
[1:11:56] me that your father will
[1:11:59] come. But at that time I didn't want to
[1:12:02] know. I told that I I told myself that I
[1:12:08] know which is something that is
[1:12:10] happening even today out there.
[1:12:13] People think that they know and they do
[1:12:15] not know. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:18] I
[1:12:20] then I then traveled.
[1:12:24] I went to other prophets,
[1:12:27] the ones that I know.
[1:12:33] I I I could feel that I've got a vacuum.
[1:12:36] I wanted to understand why can can't I
[1:12:38] get rest. I went Zimbabwe
[1:12:48] twice trying to find out what is
[1:12:50] happening to me because I am going to
[1:12:54] church but my traveling did not help me
[1:12:56] with anything. The other day
[1:13:01] the other
[1:13:03] day and while he was still young,
[1:13:08] we went to the other prophet at Bush
[1:13:10] Bag.
[1:13:12] When we when we get there,
[1:13:15] I could not
[1:13:17] find that emptiness. I I could not find
[1:13:21] anything that could satisfy my
[1:13:23] emptiness.
[1:13:24] So when all these things are happening,
[1:13:28] God is
[1:13:31] watching as he was watching. I
[1:13:35] believe now is
[1:13:40] enough. Now I'm standing
[1:13:43] up because this man is just misusing lot
[1:13:47] of
[1:13:48] time.
[1:13:50] So what then happened after that?
[1:13:57] the youngest
[1:14:00] one. He got sick
[1:14:02] terribly for three
[1:14:06] weeks pain having
[1:14:09] pain and this
[1:14:13] pain. It was a pain that was on his
[1:14:17] teeth and his faith had
[1:14:19] swollen and he had passed.
[1:14:26] by then I knew when I pray over the
[1:14:27] people they would
[1:14:29] heal. But when I was praying over my
[1:14:33] child and it was as though I was just
[1:14:37] playing and when all these things are
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:42] happening and then I had to do something
[1:14:45] that I had never had done
[1:14:48] before. So taking him out to look for
[1:14:53] prayers is not in the picture at that
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:57] time. When I get to those people, they
[1:14:59] would pray over him. There's nothing
[1:15:01] wrong. They will say, but there's
[1:15:03] nothing wrong about this boy.
[1:15:06] I said, but you can see that he's sick.
[1:15:09] Then I failed. Are we together? I
[1:15:12] remember we went deep. I
[1:15:16] remember we went to other prophet. It
[1:15:19] was in the
[1:15:21] night. I was not going for such things
[1:15:23] because I was still a
[1:15:26] pastor because God was looking for
[1:15:31] me and then the boy got sick and I did
[1:15:34] not know what to do. And then when we
[1:15:37] get to the
[1:15:38] prophet, he said, "There is nothing
[1:15:40] wrong with this boy's pain." And then I
[1:15:43] would say,
[1:15:47] "But the prophet says, "Yes, there is a
[1:15:49] pain, but I can't see
[1:15:55] anything." Antibiotics, we would give
[1:15:57] him the antibiotics.
[1:16:00] We will give him
[1:16:04] panados when this when when after he has
[1:16:07] taken antibiotics
[1:16:09] and they would numb the pain only at
[1:16:12] that
[1:16:13] time and would be able to take a
[1:16:16] breather. But when
[1:16:19] this
[1:16:20] sub then the pain starts again for three
[1:16:23] weeks.
[1:16:29] in good
[1:16:31] terms
[1:16:34] because the devil was blinded me because
[1:16:37] I could not understand him as the devil
[1:16:39] was blinding
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:42] me. He says seals have been revealed
[1:16:45] there's a book of the
[1:16:51] seven but I don't know what he's talking
[1:16:54] about. are we
[1:16:57] together and then we would fight. There
[1:16:59] was a
[1:17:00] time there's a time where he took me
[1:17:04] he took me to a restaurant somewhere
[1:17:07] in he said he want us to just have a
[1:17:14] conversation but we ended up not even
[1:17:16] finishing the
[1:17:17] food and we were now now fighting I
[1:17:21] couldn't take what he was telling
[1:17:24] me but
[1:17:27] now he g
[1:17:29] said to me, "This
[1:17:33] boy, if this boy pass on from this
[1:17:38] earth and you and your son are fighting
[1:17:40] in this
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:44] manner, you must know that that will be
[1:17:46] a wound that will never
[1:17:53] recover because the way was, it was as
[1:17:56] though he's no longer there.
[1:18:00] I said to her, "What do you want me to
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:05] do?" He said to me, "Call his
[1:18:09] brother." And then said,
[1:18:13] she said, "Yes."
[1:18:16] I said, "You call her. You call
[1:18:20] him." She then took the phone. I don't
[1:18:24] know
[1:18:25] whether Yes, there she is.
[1:18:30] Yeah, you can show him on the screen
[1:18:34] there. So
[1:18:39] I said to to her, you call him.
[1:18:43] He she called him. It was on
[1:18:50] Saturday was sleeping in her bedroom,
[1:18:53] crying, pain, in pain.
[1:18:57] And now I was just watching him. I
[1:18:58] didn't know what to do. In
[1:19:02] fact, just to show the
[1:19:06] condition just to show you how he
[1:19:09] was around 10 or so in the morning
[1:19:13] arrived around 10 in the
[1:19:15] morning. When he
[1:19:18] arrives, he asked D, "What's happening?"
[1:19:23] I said, "Here's your little young
[1:19:25] brother. is sick.
[1:19:29] We were we were planning to take him to
[1:19:31] the
[1:19:34] hospital said when did he when did he
[1:19:37] start to get sick is almost 3
[1:19:41] weeks along. He said why were you not
[1:19:44] telling me all this
[1:19:47] time now I'm in I'm in trouble as why
[1:19:51] was I not telling
[1:19:53] him are we together because of the
[1:19:58] because of the pride I had at that
[1:20:03] time. I said, "Do not ask me further
[1:20:06] questions. Here's your younger brother
[1:20:07] sick."
[1:20:09] So he said to
[1:20:13] me, "I would
[1:20:15] ask if you would allow
[1:20:19] me that I pray over or
[1:20:25] for because I knew that there were a lot
[1:20:28] of people who prayed over him and they
[1:20:32] failed. Here's another one is going to
[1:20:34] pray.
[1:20:37] He's also going to fail
[1:20:41] because the only thing we have to do is
[1:20:43] to take him to the hospital to show the
[1:20:46] power of the
[1:20:52] seven amanda. The revelation of the
[1:20:55] seven and the power of the third
[1:21:01] pool was seen or manifested.
[1:21:05] What is that? But I do not
[1:21:11] know just put laid his hand on's chest.
[1:21:18] After he has placed his hand on his
[1:21:20] chest,
[1:21:22] he started
[1:21:23] praying the revelation of the seven se
[1:21:26] and he called the revelation of the
[1:21:27] seven seiz.
[1:21:29] He called the power of the third pool.
[1:21:32] How when I as he was still laying his
[1:21:35] head and then finally went into a
[1:21:38] trance, there was a
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:42] demon that was talking through him.
[1:21:46] And when he was
[1:21:51] talking, he speaks about the matters, my
[1:21:55] matters of where I was from.
[1:22:01] Now I'm watching
[1:22:04] now. Now
[1:22:08] there
[1:22:10] everything which were happening to
[1:22:16] us and they were they were done by the
[1:22:20] witches but we did not
[1:22:23] see. But at that
[1:22:26] day all was
[1:22:35] exposed. That car just died. I do not
[1:22:38] know what killed
[1:22:40] it. But I found out on that day who was
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:45] culprit. But I'm so
[1:22:48] confused. What is going on?
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:54] at that time had his on on
[1:22:59] him by then because they were sensitive.
[1:23:04] But at the
[1:23:05] end that demon out that demon out
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:14] powerfully that demon out. After he has
[1:23:16] driven that demon out
[1:23:20] that time
[1:23:23] That pain was
[1:23:27] gone.
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:32] Now he's now he has now gotten my
[1:23:38] attention because I went all over. I
[1:23:40] failed.
[1:23:42] I went to Zimbabwe. I went to places.
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:48] What's happening?
[1:23:51] He said to me, "Daddy, all
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:55] along, I was trying to tell
[1:23:57] you, he has to
[1:24:04] intervene." So this is not
[1:24:08] me, but it's
[1:24:11] God who goes
[1:24:16] with he doing these things.
[1:24:21] Let me go back a
[1:24:24] bit because we had these differences
[1:24:28] with and with together with his
[1:24:33] wife. One time they had a child and the
[1:24:36] child passed on from this
[1:24:38] earth and I had to be at the
[1:24:42] funeral as a
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:56] That was the time I met
[1:24:59] with But when the first time I saw him,
[1:25:03] I saw some somebody like an angel or
[1:25:05] something like that. I don't know. I saw
[1:25:07] someone who looked like an angel.
[1:25:09] Something that I cannot
[1:25:13] explain. I was always fighting. I I I
[1:25:16] just felt this humbleness in me as
[1:25:19] though in the meantime I was fighting
[1:25:21] with
[1:25:25] the day. Why did you preach on that day?
[1:25:27] He spoke about
[1:25:29] Lazarus where after he has passed on
[1:25:32] that
[1:25:34] message so confused. Although I was
[1:25:37] confused, but I still remember that
[1:25:39] message from that
[1:25:42] day. Amen.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:50] Pastor when he tells me that is the God
[1:25:54] of pastor who has done all this
[1:25:57] work I said to
[1:26:00] him let me ask what should I
[1:26:04] do
[1:26:06] now because as it is
[1:26:10] now there's something that is happening
[1:26:16] [Applause]
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:32] Hallelujah. So what you give me? He then
[1:26:34] said to me, you are a pastor.
[1:26:42] Let me get hold of the pastor or the
[1:26:44] elders of the
[1:26:47] church because I now no longer have
[1:26:51] but is is the elers opportunity
[1:26:55] they will be able to talk to
[1:26:58] you let them come
[1:27:02] now that day we arrange at the same day
[1:27:05] that
[1:27:08] day he
[1:27:10] called I respect respect that man of
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:14] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:23] He's the one who was able to change my
[1:27:25] life through the
[1:27:32] codes. I remember that day we stayed
[1:27:34] until 1 1 in the
[1:27:38] morning. It was just a word after word.
[1:27:42] I was just accepting this time. I'm just
[1:27:46] receiving. I'm not talking I'm not
[1:27:48] talking much. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:52] I then
[1:27:54] ask because he was talking about the
[1:27:59] baptism. Because we baptizing in the
[1:28:02] name of the father, son, and the holy
[1:28:05] ghost. That's how I
[1:28:08] baptize. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:13] I I then asked when am I being baptized?
[1:28:22] At that time there was the wedding of
[1:28:25] pastor's
[1:28:26] grandchild
[1:28:29] and when we at that wedding on Friday
[1:28:34] but on on the same
[1:28:38] Friday was here and then we
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] came we came here at the tabernacle to
[1:28:45] be baptized. My whole family was
[1:28:46] baptized.
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] from that
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] day I was never ever I was never able to
[1:28:58] go back. Now the problem now was with
[1:29:01] the church I'm
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:07] holding that after I have found these
[1:29:11] things excitement now I have this
[1:29:14] excitement and that
[1:29:20] emptiness I could feel that I'm now
[1:29:24] filled I must help these believers
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:31] when I was
[1:29:35] I was
[1:29:38] not like to preach about the message at
[1:29:40] the time.
[1:29:48] Okay. Yeah. So that I do I should not
[1:29:50] preach the message at that
[1:29:53] church because those believers they did
[1:29:55] not know anything about the message. So
[1:30:02] that it caused the believers to say to
[1:30:04] me they I'm preaching something that
[1:30:06] they don't understand. But I
[1:30:11] believe I believe that it was God's will
[1:30:14] because after
[1:30:16] that they told me since now I'm
[1:30:19] preaching another
[1:30:22] gospel. They don't know they no longer
[1:30:24] need me as their
[1:30:28] pastor. Now I have to
[1:30:33] compare. Now I've got the
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:41] message. I remembered Paul's word where
[1:30:44] Paul
[1:30:47] says all that was a prize for
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] me. I left it
[1:30:57] back because of the greatness of knowing
[1:31:00] the Lord.
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:04] after all that has happened.
[1:31:11] And the the believers took me to the
[1:31:13] police station.
[1:31:16] They said, "We we no longer need this
[1:31:18] person at our church." I said to
[1:31:23] them, "There was no need to take me to
[1:31:25] the police station. He was just supposed
[1:31:28] to tell
[1:31:30] me because what I have
[1:31:34] so I had everything at at our church. I
[1:31:38] had everything instrument and everything
[1:31:41] instruments and everything. We had we
[1:31:43] had done a lot of work
[1:31:47] but and then it came to me that I should
[1:31:53] call in together.
[1:31:57] When I called him, I said to him,
[1:32:00] "Pastor, at my church, I'm no longer
[1:32:05] wanted. I am where I am now. I want to
[1:32:08] know where to go." is what
[1:32:14] go so I took my
[1:32:17] family says I am
[1:32:19] lord there's
[1:32:21] nothing even a single
[1:32:24] thing it can be instruments of
[1:32:28] whatever that I took it with me I just
[1:32:31] left everything
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:40] That's why I'm here today. God bless
[1:32:42] you.
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:48] [Music]

[2:15:31] I make sure when I go to

[2:15:40] to this mighty God
[2:15:45] who whom before the foundation of the
[2:15:48] world,
[2:15:49] we were with him.
[2:15:52] And he decided
[2:15:54] [Music]
[2:15:57] to choose us as his offspring
[2:16:03] and brought us down here into
[2:16:06] the body of flesh.
[2:16:09] But at this point in time, he has

[2:16:38] Lord, I know you have already healed
[2:16:41] some that are afflicted
[2:16:45] and you are still before the end of this
[2:16:48] service, you would have healed
[2:16:54] some. And Lord God, here is your word.
[2:16:59] I was looking at how John one morning
[2:17:04] sent from
[2:17:06] God to recognize the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:17:11] He stood there that morning
[2:17:15] looking around knowing that somebody is
[2:17:19] coming.
[2:17:21] He was waiting for him.
[2:17:25] As brother Brennan said,
[2:17:29] some knew that he he is coming, but they
[2:17:33] were waiting for him to come into flesh.
[2:17:39] Even now today, Lord God, we are waiting
[2:17:43] also to take off this flesh
[2:17:47] as you will call us up into beyond the
[2:17:51] sky. Amen. One of these days.

[2:18:14] Jesus is coming
[2:18:17] soon and very soon.

[2:18:36] flight to go back where we came from.
[2:18:41] Now this morning we have come this way
[2:18:46] to worship you.
[2:18:49] So bless us Lord
[2:18:52] with what you've got for us. Amen. For
[2:18:55] this morning, heal the sick.
[2:18:59] Lord, if there's somebody here who is
[2:19:02] not in the right position with God,
[2:19:06] my prayer is that time is no more.
[2:19:12] Those who are
[2:19:14] predestinated, they know it.
[2:19:17] They feel it.

[2:19:46] What remains
[2:19:48] is the rapture.

[2:27:07] he he he is placed between Israel
[2:27:13] But when he speaks about the
[2:27:18] Gentiles, that's when
[2:27:20] he he
[2:27:22] will speak to brother
[2:27:28] Mi. But it started back
[2:27:33] there when the very same brother
[2:27:37] spoke
[2:27:38] to my brother, the father of brother
[2:27:42] Muzi,
[2:27:47] very important
[2:27:49] things. He was telling
[2:27:52] him that you are there's a man
[2:28:00] your
[2:28:02] pastor. There's a man,
[2:28:08] the very same
[2:28:10] man.
[2:28:11] He told the father to brother
[2:28:16] Muzi Mi about the
[2:28:20] signs and they're saying to
[2:28:23] him there is something behind
[2:28:26] you or you are after
[2:28:31] something. Amen. Amen. Now the very same
[2:28:37] man, he is still talking even today
[2:28:43] uh it is me and brother Muzi. We know
[2:28:46] the thing.
[2:28:49] Yeah. So we don't want
[2:28:54] to Yeah. We don't want to preach about
[2:28:56] it or to talk a lot about
[2:29:00] it because it it may become a grammar.
[2:29:06] Okay. God bless you.
[2:29:10] Yeah. So now that is the position God
[2:29:13] has given
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:16] you to take from
[2:29:20] that. And as last time you brought
[2:29:24] something about the pyramid lights,
[2:29:27] pyramid lights,
[2:29:34] there's one
[2:29:36] uh I won't call the
[2:29:41] name he said
[2:29:44] uh of the pastor of this church. He said
[2:29:48] to to that uh
[2:29:51] pastor.
[2:29:56] He said to brother Muzi
[2:29:58] before we can preach something
[2:30:02] he was talking
[2:30:04] about brother M's pastor
[2:30:10] and brother Muzi understand that man
[2:30:15] and
[2:30:16] then we have given the secret to some
[2:30:21] [Music]
[2:30:23] individuals individuals
[2:30:26] because we fear that
[2:30:34] it may damage some.
[2:30:39] Amen. Okay, now let's look at this
[2:30:43] quickly and uh God bless you,
[2:30:49] brother.
[2:30:50] M that that thing came from God.
[2:30:56] And then we know
[2:31:00] now there's some what they
[2:31:02] call
[2:31:06] constellations. Then they say the
[2:31:10] zodiac and their biblical connections.
[2:31:18] Now with me you are not going to worry
[2:31:20] because you
[2:31:24] know my English is my my
[2:31:29] English. Amen. But I thank God that I
[2:31:34] can at least go this
[2:31:38] far. Abraham, Abraham, a central figure
[2:31:42] in the Bible,
[2:31:48] is closely associated with
[2:31:53] stars. That's why God said, "Look
[2:31:58] up and see if you can count the
[2:32:03] stars." That is what you call zodiac.
[2:32:08] Zodiac. Now we'll come we'll bring the
[2:32:13] material the full material on
[2:32:18] zodiac
[2:32:21] constellations because this is now the
[2:32:23] end of
[2:32:25] time and you know I was talking with the
[2:32:29] brothers
[2:32:31] recently
[2:32:35] that as it
[2:32:38] was the Lord. The Bible says at as it
[2:32:44] was so shall it
[2:32:47] be. Amen. Now, then when I watch
[2:32:53] around, I see what happened back
[2:32:59] there. Fire, water.
[2:33:04] Amen.
[2:33:05] fire was in the time
[2:33:10] of water.
[2:33:14] Uhhuh. Amen.
[2:33:16] That's
[2:33:18] why Abraham
[2:33:21] said to
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:23] Noah Lord
[2:33:27] when they separated
[2:33:29] Lord separated from Abraham
[2:33:35] and
[2:33:37] Abraham asked Lord to to choose
[2:33:44] he didn't fear
[2:33:48] that Lord will choose his place.
[2:33:52] Amen. He knew
[2:33:59] that Lord will never choose his place
[2:34:02] Abraham
[2:34:04] and the one he
[2:34:07] chose before
[2:34:12] before is destroyed.
[2:34:19] He chose that place before.
[2:34:24] Yeah. The Bible says, "So, we read it
[2:34:27] many times." Amen. Amen. What is your
[2:34:30] choice
[2:34:33] today? Now, there were two places
[2:34:37] there. One for Abraham,
[2:34:41] the one for Lord. Lord. Amen. Now,
[2:34:44] Abraham knew
[2:34:46] that Lord could not choose his
[2:34:51] place.
[2:34:52] Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:34:56] Recently, as I was talking about the
[2:35:00] zodiac,
[2:35:03] we were listening with my brother
[2:35:06] here. I fear to name him because
[2:35:09] somebody can attack him.
[2:35:13] [Music]
[2:35:15] somebody. Yeah. What I'm trying to say
[2:35:18] is
[2:35:20] uh I'm looking at some things here.
[2:35:25] Uh I preached about
[2:35:29] zodiac pyramid.
[2:35:32] Now we are going
[2:35:37] we are going now to the pyramid of
[2:35:39] angels. But we are we will try
[2:35:45] to show that when we talk about
[2:35:49] pyramid all
[2:35:59] things afterwards he's showing them to
[2:36:01] us being inside the
[2:36:04] pyramid something here let me read
[2:36:07] something here now you may not know
[2:36:11] What is a
[2:36:14] pyramid? I'm not talking about the
[2:36:21] pyramid that you see in I'm talking
[2:36:23] about the pyramid
[2:36:26] my
[2:36:28] prophet spoke
[2:36:31] about and he even saw me inside
[2:36:36] that also inside that pyramid. That is
[2:36:39] the pyramid I'm talking about.
[2:36:44] All right, let me read something
[2:36:46] here. Uh, celestial
[2:36:49] [Music]
[2:36:52] constellations. Zodiac and their
[2:36:55] biblical
[2:36:58] connections. Abraham Abraham central
[2:37:01] figure in the
[2:37:03] Bible is closely
[2:37:06] associated with stars
[2:37:12] in most of in one of the most sign
[2:37:17] little significant significant
[2:37:21] [Music]
[2:37:23] Abraham Abraham
[2:37:26] promises made to him by
[2:37:36] The
[2:37:37] Lord willing and he if he
[2:37:41] tries we will arrive at the book of Job.
[2:37:48] Job used to use constant I mean
[2:37:57] zodiac as even brotherham told me
[2:38:01] that uh
[2:38:04] Job back
[2:38:06] there he used Zodiac
[2:38:10] as his Bible.
[2:38:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now when the Lord
[2:38:16] Jesus was born
[2:38:19] They came magis.
[2:38:23] Amen.
[2:38:24] From the first Bible
[2:38:28] because the first Bible
[2:38:31] was
[2:38:32] zodiac. Amen. That is the first
[2:38:36] Bible. And he says, "And the zodiac
[2:38:41] put them into the
[2:38:45] pyramid." Amen. All right. Amen. We'll
[2:38:49] come and read them
[2:38:52] so
[2:38:53] that it won't be
[2:38:59] confusing. And
[2:39:03] I'm just reading on what we going to be
[2:39:06] talking about. You will follow if you
[2:39:10] came from
[2:39:12] him. Amen.
[2:39:16] Then what is left now?
[2:39:20] What we are going to look at next
[2:39:27] time is the pyramid of
[2:39:31] angels. I quote the
[2:39:39] prophet. No problem.
[2:39:42] What we are going to look at
[2:39:47] after
[2:39:48] this is the pyramid of
[2:39:54] angels. And last time we were
[2:39:57] trying to show some things in the
[2:40:01] pyramids of which it was just a smaller
[2:40:04] part of the whole
[2:40:07] thing because we must
[2:40:11] arrive where we are in the
[2:40:17] pyramid. While you are still wondering
[2:40:20] which pyramid I'm not talking about the
[2:40:22] pyramid of a stone.
[2:40:27] I'm going to talk about the
[2:40:30] pyramid which brother Brenham talked
[2:40:37] about but it
[2:40:39] started where it says the the first
[2:40:43] pyramid by
[2:40:46] Enoch the stones
[2:40:49] there were found there ready for to
[2:40:52] build a pyramid.
[2:40:58] Amen. Amen. But then it came through
[2:41:01] down to our
[2:41:04] time where
[2:41:07] now do you know last time we spoke about
[2:41:10] the
[2:41:13] pyramid and we're trying to show
[2:41:16] that even the people cannot see the
[2:41:19] seven seals because I said according to
[2:41:22] the prophet they are in this pyramid.
[2:41:26] You see? Amen. Amen. Yeah.
[2:41:34] Amen. Brother Brenham says the
[2:41:39] six we see
[2:41:41] it but the
[2:41:44] seventh he said it is in the three fold
[2:41:50] manner and people don't see the
[2:41:55] seventh but
[2:41:58] The
[2:41:59] bride will see it and the bride can see
[2:42:05] it. I will I will read these
[2:42:09] things from brother Brennan.
[2:42:12] How the seventh
[2:42:14] also was found at the end to be in the
[2:42:21] pyramid within the pyram. You know the
[2:42:24] message of the
[2:42:26] bride is not just a repent.
[2:42:30] No, we have passed
[2:42:33] that zone of repentance to this. The
[2:42:37] rapture is
[2:42:39] coming very very
[2:42:42] soon if you can
[2:42:45] count and see the
[2:42:49] signs. Okay. Amen.
[2:42:52] Today I won't
[2:42:54] belong. That's why God
[2:42:57] said to
[2:42:59] Abraham for his children.
[2:43:02] He said
[2:43:05] look that means look to the
[2:43:10] zodiac. Amen. We coming with
[2:43:13] that. I always want to read what I have
[2:43:16] received from the
[2:43:19] prophet. Yeah. So that if you don't
[2:43:23] understand that would mean you did not
[2:43:26] understand the prophet
[2:43:29] not me. Amen.
[2:43:32] Abraham and the stars
[2:43:35] meaning Abraham and zodiac.
[2:43:40] Amen. Right. Amen. Then we also
[2:43:43] have as we are going to see it
[2:43:51] I was reading about this one even this
[2:43:56] morning the zodiac zodiac the things
[2:44:00] that are within the zodiac.
[2:44:05] Amen. Amen. And now I can't read this is
[2:44:08] from my friend the
[2:44:12] Amen. Amen. And I'm I'll have to read it
[2:44:19] first. Um whether it will allow me to
[2:44:23] read it here.

[2:44:32] constellations. What is zodiac? You went
[2:44:34] to school. You know what the zodiac is?
[2:44:36] And the constellations.

[2:44:47] connection between scripture
[2:44:50] and the stars knowledge. Amen. Amen.
[2:44:56] Amen. That
[2:45:00] time of repent repent.
[2:45:05] It has passed. This is the rapture now.
[2:45:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:45:14] Repent talking about repent because
[2:45:16] those that are
[2:45:18] in they are already in.
[2:45:23] Amen. Amen. Uh the time for coming in
[2:45:27] has
[2:45:30] passed. I'll tell you that
[2:45:34] you are struggling. We are
[2:45:37] struggling
[2:45:41] sometimes but the youth they don't live
[2:45:49] right it does not mean that when the
[2:45:51] rapture comes you must keep quiet but
[2:45:53] you'll understand
[2:45:54] that let me get something
[2:45:57] here if it is closer to where I am
[2:46:05] It reads like this. If if this is the
[2:46:07] right thing I want to Amen. Yeah.
[2:46:11] Because
[2:46:19] age the one who inside is inside. The
[2:46:23] one who is outside is
[2:46:27] outside. Amen. Amen. Already. It has it
[2:46:31] has happened already. is the
[2:46:35] climax. To a sinner is a
[2:46:38] climax to a believer is a climax.
[2:46:43] That's
[2:46:44] all. Amen. Amen. I just want to before I
[2:46:50] close to read something.
[2:46:55] Are we together?
[2:47:00] The time to say come in, get in is over.
[2:47:07] The one who's inside is inside.
[2:47:10] The one who is outside is outside. It's
[2:47:13] either you are in or out.
[2:47:17] There's no more
[2:47:19] remedy to put you in.
[2:47:22] Amen. Amen. It is
[2:47:25] finished. That which is
[2:47:28] inside is
[2:47:30] inside. That which is
[2:47:32] outside is outside. Should we approach
[2:47:36] the one that is
[2:47:38] outside and say
[2:47:40] brother time is
[2:47:42] coming? No, it's not time is coming. It
[2:47:46] is time is
[2:47:49] here. If you are outside, you will
[2:47:52] remain outside. If you are inside, you
[2:47:55] will remain inside. But my prophet told
[2:47:59] to me that those that are inside now,
[2:48:04] they are in the
[2:48:06] pyramid. Okay. Amen. But there's still
[2:48:09] one question. What is a
[2:48:13] pyramid? The prophet has spoken
[2:48:16] of. We are coming to that. We will hear
[2:48:20] things by his
[2:48:22] grace. the seventh angel
[2:48:25] messenger. Amen. Amen. Yeah, it's over.
[2:48:30] In the book souls in prisons in prison,
[2:48:34] he even said the door is
[2:48:38] closed. If you are outside, you are
[2:48:41] outside. If you are
[2:48:44] inside, are you listening? Those that
[2:48:47] are outside, they will remain outside.
[2:48:51] or those that are inside already they
[2:48:55] are
[2:48:57] inside. Amen. Amen. The one that is
[2:49:01] inside
[2:49:03] cannot bring somebody else
[2:49:07] inside because will come you'll realize
[2:49:10] that it is in the pyramid.
[2:49:16] Either you are
[2:49:18] in or you are out.
[2:49:21] Okay, let me read something. I'm closing
[2:49:24] here.
[2:49:28] Okay. You know, h we used I used to also
[2:49:32] to go to denominations.
[2:49:35] I used to worship
[2:49:37] there every
[2:49:41] day. They will say, "Brethren, we need
[2:49:44] testimony."
[2:49:46] Then I will I would listen.
[2:49:52] Brethren,
[2:49:58] I I was drinking till the the day set.
[2:50:03] Now I realize
[2:50:05] that the people who used to say these
[2:50:08] things are drinking.
[2:50:15] Amen.
[2:50:17] It's not a matter of quit
[2:50:20] drinking. It's the matter is you are
[2:50:25] predestinated.
[2:50:30] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:32] So the gospel that we are preaching now
[2:50:37] is not to say come in.
[2:50:41] If you are a child
[2:50:43] predestinated, you are in already.
[2:50:48] I I will bring the prophet. You You
[2:50:51] listen to the man of God.
[2:50:54] Mhm. Amen. When he said the door is
[2:50:58] closed,
[2:51:01] yes. Amen.
[2:51:06] Even the one who says, "I have
[2:51:08] repented."
[2:51:10] He's talking while standing outside.
[2:51:15] But you follow, you'll hear the
[2:51:18] prophet about this time. Even
[2:51:22] today, there are some that are
[2:51:25] in some are
[2:51:29] out. Now there's go there is a
[2:51:34] gospel for the
[2:51:37] inside. Amen. Insiders have got their
[2:51:40] own gospel.
[2:51:44] the insiders. Brother Brennan speaks
[2:51:47] about
[2:51:47] them, the people that are
[2:51:50] in Amen. Amen. From God.
[2:51:56] All right.
[2:51:57] Amen. We'll come to the pyramid.
[2:52:01] You'll know what it what it
[2:52:04] is. Last time we were trying to say some
[2:52:09] things. Amen. I wonder if
[2:52:16] somebody has seen
[2:52:20] Let me read a little and then we close.
[2:52:22] Okay. Amen.
[2:52:26] Um God's first
[2:52:29] Bible was in
[2:52:32] Zodiac. That's why the sign of his
[2:52:37] birth was in zodiac.
[2:52:41] They picked up the
[2:52:44] stars. Then the prophet says, "So they
[2:52:49] follow the
[2:52:52] stars of his
[2:52:55] birth. It was a sign from the first
[2:53:01] Bible. Job will tell us about it."
[2:53:06] Amen. Amen. So his his birth was
[2:53:10] announced from the first
[2:53:14] Bible. Amen. That woman said, "I know
[2:53:19] Messiah coming." Oh my God. These are
[2:53:22] the people who were
[2:53:25] chosen. Amen. Amen. I know who was that.
[2:53:34] Now
[2:53:35] listen. She says,
[2:53:40] "I know that Messiah
[2:53:43] cometh. How did she
[2:53:47] know? And when he is come, he will tell
[2:53:51] us all
[2:53:53] things that was the Samaritan woman.
[2:54:03] Not like this women today were she knew
[2:54:06] about the
[2:54:08] coming of the Messiah.
[2:54:11] And the
[2:54:13] magis also were waiting for his coming
[2:54:18] for his
[2:54:20] birth. Then they saw his
[2:54:23] birth in zodiac. His birth in zodiac.
[2:54:29] the stars.
[2:54:32] They were led
[2:54:34] by Zodiac to where he was born.
[2:54:38] Meaning that they were led from the
[2:54:41] first
[2:54:44] Bible which is Zodiac. That's why you as
[2:54:49] the children of
[2:54:52] Abraham. Amen. Amen. You were led from
[2:54:58] Zodiac the first
[2:55:01] Bible. You can't start from the second
[2:55:05] Bible from the first
[2:55:07] Bible. That's why the Lord Jesus
[2:55:11] Christ. Amen. Amen. The
[2:55:14] witnesses was the witness was the
[2:55:17] zodiac.
[2:55:20] Amen. Okay. Amen.
[2:55:23] Now instead of going to the nursing
[2:55:28] home, instead of the
[2:55:32] major going to
[2:55:35] the game nursing home, they looked
[2:55:41] up to
[2:55:43] Zodiac, the first
[2:55:46] Bible. Amen. Amen. Because if you miss
[2:55:49] the first Bible,
[2:55:52] miss the
[2:55:53] second. Mhm. So they looked
[2:55:57] up and they said there his birth is
[2:56:03] coming. They started to follow
[2:56:09] Zodiac wherever it
[2:56:12] went because they they knew
[2:56:15] that that is his
[2:56:17] birth. That is the sign of his birth.
[2:56:21] Amen. Amen. Should we
[2:56:27] turn to the other way,
[2:56:31] we will never find
[2:56:34] him. That's why brother Brennan
[2:56:37] preach. We have seen his star in the
[2:56:41] east. We have seen the zodiac
[2:56:44] sign of his birth. Now we have come to
[2:56:48] worship.
[2:56:51] Now, amen. One would
[2:56:55] say, "How can you worship a baby?" A
[2:56:58] child.
[2:56:59] They knew that the one that is coming is
[2:57:04] not a
[2:57:06] baby, but he is put in the body of a
[2:57:09] baby.
[2:57:12] Amen. Amen. When they
[2:57:15] look, they followed him not as a
[2:57:19] baby because they said we have seen
[2:57:30] his they they didn't say we have seen
[2:57:33] the stars,
[2:57:35] we have seen
[2:57:38] his
[2:57:41] where Hallelujah.
[2:57:44] Yeah. But which side? In the east.
[2:57:48] Yeah. And have come in the east
[2:57:52] mean because there is east and
[2:57:57] west. That's why brother Brenam says we
[2:58:00] will come with that. He says I had to
[2:58:07] go
[2:58:09] west
[2:58:11] from now you'll see when we come to east
[2:58:14] and
[2:58:16] west because it says east and
[2:58:20] west
[2:58:23] met that's why with us now here
[2:58:27] uh we are not a church
[2:58:31] I I will let brother
[2:58:33] Brennham tell you about
[2:58:38] that and you'll see where he
[2:58:42] says h you will
[2:58:46] find your your place your
[2:58:50] place in the pyramid.
[2:58:54] Amen. Just wait until we come and show
[2:58:57] what is the pyramid.
[2:59:01] Because
[2:59:04] even last week we were trying to read
[2:59:06] something about
[2:59:09] it and he was talking about the
[2:59:12] pyramid and the flying interpretation.
[2:59:19] That is not the stuff of a
[2:59:25] church.
[2:59:26] It it can
[2:59:30] be accepted
[2:59:34] by those stars.
[2:59:38] The children of Abraham
[2:59:41] will still come to the stars and
[2:59:45] see the stars and the children of
[2:59:49] Abraham in the stars. We we'll look at
[2:59:53] the
[2:59:54] constellation as Job will show is we
[2:59:58] will look at is is that Job? Yes. Yes.
[3:00:03] You see how Job his Bible was the first
[3:00:09] one because he could see zodiac the
[3:00:14] stars and called them by names. The
[3:00:19] names. We will bring that also. Today is
[3:00:23] just to introduce
[3:00:25] this because it says the first
[3:00:29] Bible was in
[3:00:33] zodiac. And he says
[3:00:37] also and zodiac
[3:00:40] put them into the pyramid.
[3:00:46] Now you will realize that when he speaks
[3:00:50] about says he he he speaks about those
[3:00:54] who can see those who says the seventh
[3:00:57] is not
[3:01:00] revealed. Amen.
[3:01:03] Amen. Brother says the
[3:01:06] six
[3:01:08] still we see it but the seven is not to
[3:01:13] the public.
[3:01:16] He doesn't
[3:01:18] say that means it is there but not for
[3:01:22] the
[3:01:24] public. Now the public you realize that
[3:01:28] these are the people who are not in the
[3:01:32] pyramid because you are going to see
[3:01:35] that. The seventh
[3:01:38] seal is in the
[3:01:41] pyramid and he says you you shall see
[3:01:44] even your
[3:01:46] day in the pyramid. Now we are going to
[3:01:49] show what is a pyramid.
[3:01:53] Yeah. Amen. because the Lord is coming
[3:01:57] to take the pyramids.
[3:02:02] Then you'll you'll see even
[3:02:05] Job his Bible was in the was the first
[3:02:10] the
[3:02:12] zodiac that was his
[3:02:15] Bible
[3:02:18] the all those things but we are coming
[3:02:21] to that I'm introducing so that I
[3:02:25] can but we'll follow
[3:02:28] them by his
[3:02:31] grace Let me read this
[3:02:35] you this is not a just a church stuff.
[3:02:41] No,
[3:02:43] it is it will only be understood by
[3:02:50] the his sons and
[3:02:53] [Music]
[3:02:55] daughters because he says uh it's the
[3:02:59] climax age.
[3:03:03] Mhm. Amen. Okay. Amen. Can I read so two
[3:03:07] things here? Then inside that
[3:03:11] pyramid there was a white
[3:03:13] stone on the
[3:03:16] inside. Now you are looking for the
[3:03:20] stone. He says inside of the pyramid the
[3:03:25] stone that's why the people can't see it
[3:03:28] or know about it.
[3:03:31] They do not know about the seventh
[3:03:34] seal because where it
[3:03:38] is inside the pyramid pyramid. Yes. Now
[3:03:42] the first thing we should come and know
[3:03:45] what is a
[3:03:47] pyramid. What is that one back
[3:03:50] there in Egypt? But the pyramid
[3:03:54] now because it started with Enoch the
[3:03:58] seventh man and now this is the seventh
[3:04:01] church
[3:04:04] age. Amen. Amen. Now the seventh church
[3:04:07] age should it should
[3:04:10] be h the sons and
[3:04:14] daughters of God.
[3:04:17] uh who who were born here as
[3:04:21] humans. The
[3:04:22] bodies were born here but they were not
[3:04:26] born
[3:04:28] here. It is your body which was born
[3:04:33] here. Amen. Amen. It was the body of God
[3:04:38] which was
[3:04:39] Jesus. That body was born
[3:04:43] here. Amen. Amen. forunner. You must
[3:04:47] always listen to the
[3:04:50] forerunner. The forerunner
[3:04:53] came early in the
[3:04:55] morning. He was sent to recognize
[3:04:59] him. Amen. Amen. As h the prophet of
[3:05:05] God was
[3:05:08] sent also to make him
[3:05:12] known. Amen. Now
[3:05:16] Uh the Samaritan woman
[3:05:19] says, "I know." How did he know? She
[3:05:23] know
[3:05:25] Messiah cometh.
[3:05:28] And when he has come, he will tell
[3:05:33] us how many
[3:05:37] things. Meaning he has told
[3:05:42] us all.
[3:05:47] That's why I don't need a Bible school.
[3:05:53] He didn't introduce to us a
[3:05:56] school. He introduced
[3:06:01] himself to us. You can't go to school
[3:06:05] for to learn about
[3:06:07] God. No, he comes to you inside of you.
[3:06:13] That's why this woman
[3:06:15] says, "I
[3:06:17] know." How did she know a predestinated
[3:06:21] seed?
[3:06:23] She knew that the Messiah is coming.
[3:06:27] Not only that, but when he has
[3:06:32] come, he will tell
[3:06:35] us not about the the book of
[3:06:40] Matthew, but
[3:06:47] all have you ever heard the all things
[3:06:51] of God?
[3:06:57] A person can a man can say to
[3:07:00] you. I want to tell you all
[3:07:03] things he will
[3:07:06] never because all things are with
[3:07:09] God. Only God can tell you all things.
[3:07:16] Amen. Praise God. All right. Amen.
[3:07:20] And but how did this woman know?
[3:07:25] because she was from the from
[3:07:30] zodiac children of
[3:07:33] Abraham from zodiac
[3:07:36] when the Messiah
[3:07:41] cometh. She didn't
[3:07:44] say at school that we were taught
[3:07:47] that when Messiah comes. No, it is in
[3:07:52] her. Sure, she doesn't need any
[3:07:58] school because it is put in
[3:08:03] her. If it is not
[3:08:05] inside now, you need a school.
[3:08:10] Amen. and school don't have it
[3:08:16] all concerning the word of
[3:08:19] God. Now, no school can teach you about
[3:08:22] God. God
[3:08:25] himself comes into
[3:08:27] you and into. Amen. Hallelujah. And you
[3:08:31] know him. This woman says, I know
[3:08:37] how because it was put in her
[3:08:41] and she is from
[3:08:44] him. Now if God has chosen
[3:08:48] you, he is in you.
[3:08:51] Then you know, I know the rapture is
[3:08:57] coming.
[3:08:58] Amen. She was not a woman
[3:09:01] preacher. She was a predestinated
[3:09:07] seed. A predestinated seed.
[3:09:10] Even today, he's not a person. You will
[3:09:15] always follow him. Try to do good
[3:09:18] things. Don't do that. Don't do
[3:09:24] that. But a child of
[3:09:27] God inside of him is the super
[3:09:36] intelligence which is of God.
[3:09:40] Amen. John comes
[3:09:43] to Jordan
[3:09:47] already. God has put it in
[3:09:53] him. Jesus used to walk
[3:09:56] there. No one knew
[3:10:00] him. But John came
[3:10:03] there. And when the Lord Jesus
[3:10:07] arrived, he said, "Behold,
[3:10:12] that was a
[3:10:14] forerunner." Now, being a
[3:10:17] forerunner, he
[3:10:19] knew. Listen, this woman says,
[3:10:23] "I she doesn't say I I was
[3:10:26] taught." No, I know personally. I
[3:10:32] know that the Messiah is coming and I
[3:10:37] know that when he has come he will tell
[3:10:41] us all
[3:10:42] things. Listen, he says, "I know."
[3:10:48] She didn't say, "We I passed this lesson
[3:10:53] at a certain
[3:10:55] certain." It's a personal
[3:10:58] thing. You as a
[3:11:01] Christian, it should be a personal
[3:11:04] thing. You know who is God. You know his
[3:11:09] law. Because that you will never know it
[3:11:13] if it is outside
[3:11:19] outside. I can f more in closing. Let me
[3:11:24] finish here. In closing,
[3:11:27] you yourself know.
[3:11:32] Do you know that in the Bible? Amen. You
[3:11:37] yourself know.
[3:11:40] Amen. All right. Amen. So if you know
[3:11:44] you don't need a teacher.
[3:11:51] Let me close here.
[3:11:55] I I we still got things that we are
[3:11:58] going to
[3:12:07] uh there are things here. Amen. But some
[3:12:13] we will come and look at them.
[3:12:18] Uh let me just look at this.
[3:12:23] H the pyramid
[3:12:26] of Enoch. Enoch.
[3:12:30] Then it comes
[3:12:33] the
[3:12:35] pyramid. Hey, you see brother
[3:12:40] Listen here.
[3:12:42] The
[3:12:43] pyramid of angels. Pyramid.
[3:12:51] Who can know about this?
[3:12:55] Have you ever pyramid of angels?
[3:13:01] The angels
[3:13:03] took
[3:13:05] me in the pyramid of themselves.
[3:13:12] I'm going to give you these quotations.
[3:13:16] This is the prophet
[3:13:18] speaking. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because he
[3:13:22] says inside of the
[3:13:28] pyramid it's he says it is not to the
[3:13:32] public they can't know about the seven
[3:13:35] that's why they say it is not
[3:13:38] revealed because they are
[3:13:42] without then he
[3:13:45] says the pyram let me let me
[3:13:51] inside of the pyramid.
[3:13:57] It is not to the
[3:13:59] public how God separates these
[3:14:05] things. Amen. for the
[3:14:10] bride. You'll see that you
[3:14:13] also he says you are in the pyramid.
[3:14:18] But I'm going I don't want to say it
[3:14:20] myself. I'm going to read
[3:14:22] it inside of the
[3:14:27] pyramid. That mean it is inside of the
[3:14:30] pyramid. That's why he says it is not
[3:14:34] the seventh seal is not to the
[3:14:38] public because it is
[3:14:42] inside of the pyramid. Pyramid. Amen.
[3:14:46] All right. The people know about the
[3:14:48] pyramid in
[3:14:50] Egypt. Now we come we'll show you the
[3:14:53] one in
[3:14:56] Egypt. And even the the bride is made
[3:15:00] like a
[3:15:03] pyramid. Yeah. You bring your book
[3:15:05] because we are going to quote
[3:15:08] them. The the the
[3:15:11] bride I I don't quote. Now the bride is
[3:15:15] made like
[3:15:18] a pyramid. Amen. That's that that means
[3:15:23] that you can't receive the seventh
[3:15:30] seal just from nowhere.
[3:15:34] It's being building
[3:15:36] up from
[3:15:40] zodiac. You receive it because it is in
[3:15:45] you. Amen. You don't receive it because
[3:15:48] a preacher is preaching about it.
[3:15:55] They were taught
[3:15:58] that the Messiah is coming.
[3:16:01] But that day they saw
[3:16:05] it. Amen.
[3:16:08] Today to us we're going to look at the
[3:16:11] pyramid.
[3:16:13] They also were looking at
[3:16:18] Zodiac. Then they said there he is
[3:16:22] born. Yeah, he is
[3:16:26] born. They didn't say the stars are
[3:16:30] born, but they saw the
[3:16:33] sign in Zodiac that the Messiah is born.
[3:16:39] They started to walk. They follow the
[3:16:44] zodiac. Hallelujah asking where is he
[3:16:49] that is born king of the Jews.
[3:16:53] The people didn't
[3:16:55] know some would
[3:16:58] say others would say if you can go this
[3:17:00] way. I remember when we were traveling
[3:17:02] with my
[3:17:05] brothers down there in the north.
[3:17:10] Now we are we we we come across a
[3:17:15] lady. We ask her about the
[3:17:18] direction to direct us to where we were
[3:17:21] supposed to
[3:17:22] go. Then she started by
[3:17:27] saying, "Oh, okay. You say you want
[3:17:31] to to arrive at such and such.
[3:17:37] Yes,
[3:17:39] ma'am. Let me
[3:17:48] see. You know why?
[3:17:52] She herself didn't
[3:17:54] know, but she was trying to help.
[3:18:00] Now we should do this and
[3:18:03] [Music]
[3:18:06] speaking alone.
[3:18:14] You say you want to get
[3:18:16] to and we said, "Okay, sister, don't
[3:18:20] worry."
[3:18:22] Yeah.
[3:18:23] And but you know she wanted to show us
[3:18:27] the way.
[3:18:31] Yeah. Then even if we say
[3:18:37] sister you say you are going to then we
[3:18:41] see that this sister she really wants to
[3:18:44] show us the
[3:18:45] way. Mhm.
[3:18:48] Until we said don't worry sister.
[3:18:51] She
[3:18:52] said we drove off.
[3:18:58] Amen. Okay.
[3:19:01] Because if you don't know the
[3:19:05] way I don't know it, you just she was
[3:19:08] struggling
[3:19:10] to plant
[3:19:12] it. She wanted us to find a
[3:19:16] way. She herself didn't know.
[3:19:22] Yeah, there are preachers like
[3:19:27] that they preach about the thing and
[3:19:30] they themselves are not sure
[3:19:35] of now here comes
[3:19:38] John. He didn't
[3:19:41] [Music]
[3:19:43] say Messiah
[3:19:50] No.
[3:19:54] Did you say Jesus? Are you Jesus? Are
[3:19:56] you Are you Jesus?
[3:20:03] Behold the lamb of God.
[3:20:07] How did he notice him?
[3:20:10] He was a
[3:20:13] for because
[3:20:16] the one who has sent him
[3:20:19] He has given him
[3:20:21] that. He knew who he has to
[3:20:25] introduce. He had to
[3:20:27] introduce. That's why he didn't say to
[3:20:32] Jesus. I don't want to make me mistake.
[3:20:35] Are you
[3:20:38] Jesus? Because anybody can say yes, I'm
[3:20:40] Jesus.
[3:20:47] And then you find yourself introducing a
[3:20:50] drunken.
[3:20:54] Now if
[3:20:56] now if he sends he has put the thing
[3:20:58] already in
[3:21:03] him. Amen.
[3:21:06] And then that's why he was looking
[3:21:11] around say with those eagle eyes.
[3:21:17] Amen. Amen. And then waiting for the
[3:21:22] Messiah. He he was not to introduce the
[3:21:25] one who looked like the
[3:21:29] Messiah. Messiah.
[3:21:34] Now I said I I I I'm just coming to
[3:21:37] introduce.
[3:21:40] Amen. Amen. That you will see what is a
[3:21:44] pyramid. What is in the
[3:21:49] pyramid? All right. Amen. It started
[3:21:52] with
[3:21:53] Enoch back
[3:21:55] there and they are all come like as a
[3:22:00] pyramid.
[3:22:03] And then the seven
[3:22:06] churches also are in the form
[3:22:12] of I will come to read it where he says
[3:22:17] the the bride is like a
[3:22:20] pyramid. I'll come and not not the
[3:22:23] church the bride is like a pyramid.
[3:22:28] The city is like a pyramid. So the whole
[3:22:31] thing is like a pyramid.
[3:22:37] Okay. The church itself. It fits in the
[3:22:42] pyramid. It is like a pyramid. Pyramid.
[3:22:47] But while you are still
[3:22:50] searching, let us find first what is a
[3:22:55] pyramid. You find the
[3:23:00] pyramid of the angels. That's why it is
[3:23:03] coming.
[3:23:05] Yeah, it is in seals 576.
[3:23:11] 576, paragraph 405. Paragraph 405. The
[3:23:17] angels took
[3:23:20] me in that pyramid
[3:23:25] of
[3:23:28] themselves. Who can interpret
[3:23:31] [Music]
[3:23:32] that? Maybe that's why we are we are
[3:23:36] quiet.
[3:23:43] Do you believe that brother is a
[3:23:44] prophet?
[3:23:46] Amen. Not only the
[3:23:51] prophet
[3:23:55] because others they others that appears
[3:23:58] to the television. The
[3:24:01] angels. This is the seventh angel.
[3:24:08] The angels.
[3:24:10] took
[3:24:11] me in that
[3:24:14] pyramid of themselves.
[3:24:19] Meaning there is a pyramid of
[3:24:23] angels that will bring
[3:24:26] them through
[3:24:29] Yeah.
[3:24:30] statues. Yeah. Stages.
[3:24:33] God bless you. God bless you. Amen.
[3:24:35] Yeah. Then more area on the inside of
[3:24:39] that
[3:24:40] pyramid. There was a white
[3:24:45] stone on the
[3:24:47] inside. Now we will bring you to this
[3:24:51] place where it says there's a stone in
[3:24:57] you and where it says Jesus is that
[3:25:02] stone.
[3:25:04] But if he is a stone, then he has put a
[3:25:08] stone in
[3:25:10] you. I'm going to read it to you. I'll
[3:25:12] give you the
[3:25:14] code. Then I said, "Oh, yeah." That's
[3:25:17] why I've got a stone in
[3:25:21] me. Then he said to Peter, "Upon this
[3:25:26] rock." Because Peter means a
[3:25:31] small upon this rock.
[3:25:35] I will
[3:25:37] build. He He didn't say Peter I want you
[3:25:39] to
[3:25:40] build. I You know you are a child of God
[3:25:45] because he has built that in
[3:25:52] you. I'll tell you
[3:25:54] something. H you know today.
[3:26:00] Yeah. But you you are going to hear
[3:26:02] things not from me, from the
[3:26:06] prophet. Amen. I'm also here by his
[3:26:10] grace.
[3:26:12] I want to read you the last
[3:26:17] thing. But
[3:26:19] otherwise, did you hear this little part
[3:26:22] that we have
[3:26:25] introduced? Amen. The angels. If now
[3:26:30] This stone is not in
[3:26:32] you. And it says
[3:26:36] the angels we talking about the the
[3:26:40] message, the true
[3:26:42] message ends up in the pyramid.
[3:26:47] But you should know what is a
[3:26:51] pyramid. Enoch. Enoch back there.
[3:26:55] That was of uh stone.
[3:26:59] That's right. Amen. But the pyramid we
[3:27:02] are
[3:27:02] talking about
[3:27:05] today in
[3:27:07] this time, we are not talking about the
[3:27:11] pyram of a
[3:27:13] stone. But it started there as the
[3:27:17] pyramid of
[3:27:19] stone. But today
[3:27:22] He says the bride is built like a
[3:27:27] pyramid but it started as a stone
[3:27:33] that I I I said when we were told that
[3:27:39] uh the Americans
[3:27:43] went to the moon.
[3:27:46] Amen. Amen. What happened is that
[3:27:50] when the astronauts
[3:27:52] arrive
[3:27:54] back with what
[3:27:56] they thought to be their
[3:28:01] evidence to show
[3:28:03] that they they've been to the
[3:28:06] moon. What was it? A
[3:28:11] sto. That's why I
[3:28:13] say one day when I was in Malawi,
[3:28:19] we were at Lake Malawi Malawi. I was
[3:28:22] with a
[3:28:23] brother. Then there's some boulders
[3:28:27] there close to the lake. So as we were
[3:28:32] passing, I said to the brother,
[3:28:35] "Brother, you see this
[3:28:37] rock, this boulder,
[3:28:40] it was here when Jesus was
[3:28:44] here." Amen. Amen. It
[3:28:48] carries the the the testimony testimony
[3:28:51] of ages.
[3:28:54] That's why we say rock
[3:28:59] of it seems little to million last year.
[3:29:02] Not the one that
[3:29:03] started you'll find nothing from that
[3:29:06] one
[3:29:08] but the rock
[3:29:10] of I will show you. I will bring it
[3:29:14] where it says there's a stone in
[3:29:18] you now because since he is a
[3:29:23] rock there's a
[3:29:26] rock
[3:29:29] Peter flesh and blood has not revealed
[3:29:33] this to
[3:29:34] you my father.
[3:29:38] Okay. Amen. Now
[3:29:41] to build a
[3:29:44] church he spoke about the material
[3:29:48] first upon
[3:29:51] this
[3:29:52] rock and you will hear where the prophet
[3:29:56] says there is a rock in
[3:30:00] you for for
[3:30:02] now h there's something let me not touch
[3:30:07] it but I and say you will hear this
[3:30:13] uh
[3:30:14] where he speaks
[3:30:17] about the end time.
[3:30:24] You know what what he has said
[3:30:29] about men
[3:30:31] about the end time.
[3:30:34] Let me I don't want to start reading
[3:30:37] it. Yes, he spoke of the end
[3:30:43] time, the children of God in the end
[3:30:48] time. Now you will hear him as we will
[3:30:52] read it here.
[3:30:56] that he is no longer a mediator.
[3:31:01] [Music]
[3:31:02] Wait
[3:31:03] until he speaks for himself.
[3:31:08] It says he is the Lord Jesus Christ is
[3:31:12] no
[3:31:13] longer then I said all
[3:31:16] right that's why I wondered at these
[3:31:20] things the people come to church let me
[3:31:25] not read it
[3:31:27] please it's just a tip that we are
[3:31:31] coming you'll wonder
[3:31:34] today the people come to church young
[3:31:38] people they come to do they are young
[3:31:41] their
[3:31:43] things whether you preach or you don't
[3:31:46] preach whether you pray for
[3:31:48] him then I heard it even this morning
[3:31:53] what is happening I I I've got it I was
[3:31:57] reading this
[3:31:59] morning then it will show you of the
[3:32:02] people they come to church yeah
[3:32:06] And there's so much power
[3:32:10] here, but it's for the
[3:32:15] predestinated. If a person is not right
[3:32:18] here, we've we have the people that are
[3:32:22] still
[3:32:24] smoking. They are drinking
[3:32:27] there. They come here. You can preach
[3:32:32] until you turn blue. you want to help
[3:32:35] them.
[3:32:39] Predestination is the answer.
[3:32:45] It's not something
[3:32:52] that today I'm going to tell them.
[3:32:58] This youth running around here in the
[3:33:00] church, I'm going to take them out. I'm
[3:33:03] going to tell them nothing.
[3:33:07] Unless they are predestinated.
[3:33:12] Amen.
[3:33:21] This cat that comes to my house. First
[3:33:25] there was a black one.
[3:33:29] I don't know if it still exist. Then
[3:33:31] there's a a white one.
[3:33:34] tree.
[3:33:38] They are coming in colors.
[3:33:43] So we have all all all kinds now
[3:33:48] cats a
[3:33:56] cat. People are scared of them.
[3:34:00] People are scared of cats.
[3:34:05] Even when he's happy, he gets disturbed.
[3:34:08] They say, "No, this say it belongs to
[3:34:11] the
[3:34:11] witches." What is this kid doing
[3:34:15] here? Then there is power.
[3:34:24] Power. He's afraid of a cat.
[3:34:28] Amen. Now,
[3:34:32] Now there is this
[3:34:35] one comes to my
[3:34:37] house. There are
[3:34:41] two. There is this white one. I always
[3:34:45] see it.
[3:34:48] Oh, initially I thought it was a
[3:34:53] ball. It can position itself. When you
[3:34:56] look, you just see a round ball.
[3:35:02] Let me Yeah. Now
[3:35:07] I realize
[3:35:09] that the same I still find it in the
[3:35:12] same place the following
[3:35:14] day. Now I told this one here is a case
[3:35:20] it stays there and position itself like
[3:35:22] a ball. At first,
[3:35:26] I thought I was going to call
[3:35:28] someone a paper or I thought it was a
[3:35:32] folded like this, a round paper like
[3:35:34] that. Amen. Amen. Then I realized when
[3:35:38] it stretched
[3:35:40] itself this is
[3:35:44] a things like that. Now what I'm saying
[3:35:48] is tomorrow
[3:35:53] when I check it's still in that
[3:36:01] position because people when they
[3:36:06] see a certain old man had a special whip
[3:36:10] for the for
[3:36:13] the can
[3:36:21] has a
[3:36:22] cat. Now he get confused. What's What
[3:36:26] about this cat? This
[3:36:29] cat don't want a cat here in the house.
[3:36:32] Amen.
[3:36:35] Now I just looked at it. I said, "Okay,
[3:36:38] it will go." No problem.
[3:36:48] I can't read all this. Amen. Amen.
[3:36:54] Let me
[3:36:55] not prophet
[3:36:58] says
[3:37:00] speaks
[3:37:01] something. Why the people but come
[3:37:06] here and they
[3:37:09] are
[3:37:11] continue and being in the church. Now we
[3:37:14] are not in a church.
[3:37:18] We are in Christ.
[3:37:21] The people in the church, they carry on
[3:37:24] doing their
[3:37:25] things. Amen.
[3:37:31] Yes, they do
[3:37:36] that. If you go to the churches there,
[3:37:40] I would see it myself.
[3:37:45] uncle. Let me respect.
[3:37:52] He would go to whom you call Pentecost.
[3:37:55] Then now when he
[3:37:57] lives,
[3:38:00] my mother and go in there with my mom.
[3:38:04] He's the brother to my
[3:38:06] mother. My mother would be so angry
[3:38:10] because he would smoke a big Z like
[3:38:13] this.
[3:38:15] And when he gets money and then he will
[3:38:17] drink. Amen.
[3:38:20] Now when my mama says we are going to
[3:38:23] service and at that time the
[3:38:26] Pentecost most of you they were singing
[3:38:30] that
[3:38:32] time. He loves singing.
[3:38:36] When they go
[3:38:37] out he
[3:38:40] Amen. He rolls the that zone. Yeah.
[3:38:43] Amen. That's all. Amen.
[3:38:47] And then usually
[3:38:50] he puts it on top of the fridge.
[3:38:55] Now you start hearing. He really loves
[3:38:58] it. Says, "Amen." Yeah. We'll see
[3:39:03] you
[3:39:04] still. My
[3:39:07] mother. It made him angry because the z
[3:39:10] was here on top of the bridge.
[3:39:13] Now when they come back
[3:39:16] not talking nicely to one another.
[3:39:19] My mother being angry about this thing
[3:39:21] on top
[3:39:23] and angry about when they get
[3:39:27] there dances more than anyone there.
[3:39:34] Now, now when they get home, the first
[3:39:42] thing you place the Z on top of the
[3:39:47] fridge, I
[3:39:49] say I said, "How did it go,
[3:39:54] uncle?" He says, "Ah, no. Trying to tell
[3:39:58] you." He says, "You know, the way we
[3:40:01] were blessed
[3:40:03] You should have gone there
[3:40:08] yourself. He's doing that busy with the
[3:40:14] zone. Now we have people like that here
[3:40:17] in the
[3:40:21] service they
[3:40:23] also but they have their own zone and
[3:40:26] their things. But now the thing
[3:40:30] is I will not call you are condemned go
[3:40:33] to
[3:40:36] hell
[3:40:40] predestination predestination that
[3:40:43] is he will not take
[3:40:47] a he has been
[3:40:49] called he will not drink and
[3:40:53] then no one will force him to do those
[3:40:56] things.
[3:41:01] No, no, no, no. It should come from
[3:41:05] God.
[3:41:09] Predestination
[3:41:14] not so nice. I
[3:41:18] even you were predestinated. The real
[3:41:21] one is that you were predestinated. Let
[3:41:24] us stand up please. Come out. God bless
[3:41:26] you. Praise God.
[3:41:35] Yes. Baptism.

[3:58:53] Acts chapter 2 from verse
[3:58:57] 36-39. Therefore, let all the house of
[3:59:00] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[3:59:03] that same Jesus whom ye have crucified,
[3:59:07] both Lord and Christ. Now when they
[3:59:10] heard this, they were pricricked in
[3:59:11] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[3:59:14] the rest of the apostles, "Men and
[3:59:16] brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter
[3:59:19] said unto them,"Repent and be baptized,
[3:59:22] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[3:59:25] Christ, for the remission of sins, and
[3:59:27] ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
[3:59:29] Ghost. For the promise is unto you and
[3:59:32] to your children, and to all that are a
[3:59:35] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[3:59:38] God shall call.
