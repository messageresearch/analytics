[44:16] uh
[44:23] the Battle of two Natures in a man EMP
[44:28] yes
[44:31] now uh I'm sure when my brother was
[44:36] reading this uh these verses that you
[44:39] have read
[44:40] um
[44:43] some of you got confused
[44:46] and they stopped reading
[44:52] because it says for that which I do
[44:55] Google
[44:57] I allow North
[45:01] right but if your Bible Zulu Bible
[45:04] doesn't say so God is
[45:09] then it for what I would that do I not
[45:14] lowering if is
[45:17] but what I hate that do I go to alone
[45:22] so there's a lot of things that have
[45:24] been said
[45:27] for what I do local
[45:32] I allow North
[45:36] how can you allow what you are doing
[45:40] um
[45:42] says what I do eating
[45:46] it's happening I'm doing it
[45:48] but I did not allow it to to to be done
[45:54] but who's doing it
[45:56] it's either doing it
[45:59] but I don't allow it but I'm doing it on
[46:03] your friends
[46:04] so it's a confusion
[46:09] then he said
[46:13] what I will do local English
[46:24] but what I hate that do I long
[46:31] now here he is speaking it's Paul here
[46:34] [Music]
[46:35] he's speaking about the two Natures that
[46:38] are in a man is
[46:43] uh god um
[46:45] said let us make man in our image
[46:50] after our likeness asifos
[46:54] right amen then he formed Men Out of the
[46:59] Dust of the Earth
[47:05] he has created man in his likeness
[47:11] together amen said let us make man in
[47:14] our image it is
[47:19] then secondly with there was a second
[47:23] man
[47:24] made out of the Dust of the earth
[47:28] you see there are two yeah
[47:32] and their Natures are not the same
[47:37] but then what what what he did
[47:41] after he
[47:45] took the dust of the earth and
[47:50] Made Men Out of the Dust of the earth
[47:54] now he breathed the Breath of Life
[48:01] so
[48:03] then after that I'm Vara Loco then it
[48:06] took
[48:07] gwatata the man
[48:11] that the first man
[48:13] and put him in this second language
[48:17] then the Bible says Man became a living
[48:24] so now
[48:26] he didn't have two bodies
[48:30] one for the spirit
[48:33] one for this
[48:36] Now One Day pastor Maguire said to me
[48:44] when we have funerals um
[48:48] let us teach the way we teach merciful
[48:53] he said to me what he gave me
[48:56] the other people
[48:58] I don't want to quote
[49:01] the different churches
[49:06] will never compromise because
[49:13] there are visitors
[49:17] now they don't compromise the word of
[49:19] God Manji yes I remember we were bearing
[49:28] now uh I'm I'm going to speak as though
[49:32] I'm in a church
[49:35] but at the same time food
[49:39] making you aware that you know
[49:43] many
[49:44] conscientizing you about
[49:47] life and death
[49:52] right now there is a
[49:57] a a spiritual man to a small that will
[50:02] live
[50:04] in a natural manner
[50:09] let me repeat there's a spiritual man
[50:13] that will live in a natural body also
[50:17] pillars
[50:19] now according to the promise
[50:22] sorry now if you read Matthew chapter 3
[50:30] let's read
[50:33] chapter 16 and 17.
[50:37] I mean chapter 3 verse 16 and 17. with
[50:40] chapter 3 verse 16.
[50:42] you know 17. now the Bible says here if
[50:46] I have a little upper oh sorry
[50:49] uh
[50:52] and Jesus when he was baptized
[50:55] went up straight out of the water
[50:59] and lo the heavens were opened unto him
[51:02] and he saw the spirit of God descending
[51:05] like a dove
[51:06] and lighting upon him
[51:10] and lo a voice from Heaven saying this
[51:13] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[51:15] pleased
[51:17] now here we heard Jesus
[51:22] now when he was he was born like anybody
[51:27] but now the day he was taken to the
[51:31] temple
[51:37] uh there was a priest today guava Kono
[51:40] priest and that that priest loyan priest
[51:43] was told by the holy spirit
[51:47] that he will not die
[51:53] um
[51:55] so when the mothers were bringing in
[51:59] their children
[52:01] in the temple a temple to be circumcised
[52:05] and to be blessed way it was different
[52:09] mothers real
[52:12] and then different children
[52:16] but that priest when he took our Lord
[52:19] Jesus Christ
[52:23] that very same spirit
[52:26] that he told him that he will not die
[52:30] until he sees it
[52:34] anointed him
[52:38] that Spirit fell upon him
[52:42] then he started prophesying Prophet no
[52:46] it was a long queue
[52:48] um
[52:51] he was saying to the people
[52:55] this is the messiah
[52:59] now people that knew Maria abandoned
[53:04] umaria were surprised
[53:06] because they know the story behind Maria
[53:10] and this child
[53:14] all right together amen
[53:17] now he started blessing the child
[53:22] prophesy and did his job when some
[53:26] service work but what I want you to
[53:28] notice is
[53:30] as we're talking about the two Natures
[53:41] you've got two Natures in yourself
[53:47] and then when
[53:49] and the prophet says
[53:52] when a mother is expecting a child
[53:55] um
[53:58] now there's also that's a there's a body
[54:02] in her room
[54:06] and then there's also another poetifuch
[54:09] in the form of the spirit
[54:12] that one to occupy that board as soon as
[54:16] that body is is born of there's a spirit
[54:20] that needs to come into that food
[54:26] foreign
[54:36] [Music]
[54:40] the prophet calls it a little angel um
[54:44] that needs to occupy that body
[54:49] is
[54:53] then he says
[54:55] the nature of that woman
[54:59] would change
[55:02] you you look at any woman
[55:07] when she's expecting a child
[55:10] [Music]
[55:11] and nature changes
[55:15] and then when the child is born um
[55:18] and that Spirit comes into that child
[55:23] now that spirit
[55:27] it's a spirit Moya I would say it's a
[55:31] temporary Spirit
[55:35] pending on the predestination
[55:40] when that spirit is born um
[55:44] it takes the nature of the female or
[55:49] um when that child is born
[55:52] that child takes the nature of the
[55:55] famous
[55:57] it takes the nature of his father and
[56:00] his mother
[56:03] are we together amen now as he or she
[56:08] grows
[56:10] then there is another body if
[56:24] that will come gradually to him in the
[56:27] form of the word of God All Souls
[56:32] when he hears the word of God
[56:35] is okay
[56:43] foreign
[56:47] I'd like us to read verse 16.
[56:51] over 16. it says
[56:55] the spirit itself buried witness with
[56:58] our spirit that we are the children of
[57:01] God
[57:04] so now speaking about the two Spirits
[57:11] says the spirit itself
[57:14] parrot witness with our spirit
[57:18] that we are the children of course
[57:23] there is a spirit that keeps your body
[57:26] alive
[57:29] but there's a spirit
[57:32] that will come over oza uh change the
[57:38] Natural Spirit that is in you also
[57:43] you won't have two bodies
[57:46] one for the natural Spirits
[57:50] another one for The Supernaturals
[57:54] those two spirits
[57:57] will come and live in you
[58:02] the other spirit will keep the body
[58:04] alive
[58:07] but the other spirit
[58:10] will prepare you
[58:13] so that when your spirit leaves you
[58:18] you'll be having another boat
[58:22] can I repeat myself
[58:30] speaking about the two Natures
[58:34] that were fighting in him
[58:39] your natural Spirit
[58:43] once the natural things
[58:47] now he speaks about the things that he
[58:52] wants to do
[58:56] let me let me go back to it again
[59:02] [Music]
[59:02] um
[59:03] that was in The Book of Romans chapter 7
[59:07] amen now verse 15 says 15 UTI
[59:11] for that which I do
[59:14] I allow not located
[59:19] now if there's something that he do mind
[59:22] you um
[59:23] which is not right
[59:25] it come by itself
[59:31] because you need a spirit
[59:34] that will stop that thing within you
[59:36] also
[59:39] for what I would I would that I do not
[59:43] look what I hate that I do
[59:46] foreign
[1:00:38] leave him alone no this man was drunk
[1:00:43] waiting for my glory and don't you know
[1:00:45] what discussing about flowers and he's
[1:00:47] telling me to leave that one and we are
[1:00:49] discussing flowers and I know imagine
[1:00:52] yes I want strength also naming when you
[1:00:56] have real real drunk um
[1:00:58] you tell yourself
[1:01:01] I will never never touch a bottle in my
[1:01:04] life
[1:01:08] but within three days you'll be drunk
[1:01:11] and vagins was entire Tuesday
[1:01:13] and then you won't know why are you
[1:01:17] drunk
[1:01:18] you may not even know why are you
[1:01:21] drinking anything you're saying that I
[1:01:24] want to quit smoking
[1:01:28] [Music]

[1:01:35] but you'll find yourself having a packet
[1:01:38] yeah
[1:01:41] because you have another nature in you
[1:01:47] that drives you to do those things
[1:01:51] you want to do away with each
[1:01:56] but you don't have any power this this
[1:01:58] nature is overpowering you God
[1:02:04] are we together amen
[1:02:07] oh
[1:02:09] the prophet always says if you take any
[1:02:13] road
[1:02:14] um Prophet UTI um
[1:02:17] uh or two Natures
[1:02:21] or two atmospheres
[1:02:25] two signs
[1:02:28] anything you want to uh
[1:02:33] there is
[1:02:35] Jesus
[1:02:37] right in the middle
[1:02:40] so Jesus Christ is in the middle
[1:02:45] um
[1:02:46] it depends on which direction are you
[1:02:49] taking
[1:02:51] but he's standing here
[1:02:54] so it all depends with which nature
[1:03:26] each and everyone came and made a
[1:03:29] sacrifice
[1:03:32] now each and every sacrifice that was
[1:03:35] made
[1:03:39] uh it was done by a revelation that was
[1:03:43] in that specific individuals
[1:03:51] it it was their their their sacrifice
[1:03:54] were was contrary to each other
[1:03:59] how are we together amen okay fine let's
[1:04:03] come to ourselves
[1:04:06] we've been worshiping God
[1:04:10] we've been saying the Lord is coming
[1:04:15] everybody
[1:04:17] says the Lord is coming
[1:04:21] and then but now are you aware that you
[1:04:25] are facing two directions
[1:04:30] you say we are going to heaven
[1:04:33] you must reach heavenly
[1:04:37] you must not walk eternally until you
[1:04:39] are going to happen
[1:04:42] say the Lord is coming um
[1:04:45] you must be able to pinpoint where he is
[1:04:52] you can you cannot just say he is coming
[1:04:57] yes not knowing where he is
[1:05:00] I always say when I was traveling from
[1:05:04] where I stay
[1:05:05] um
[1:05:12] and I must see myself
[1:05:16] I must know that now I am into a fun day
[1:05:19] in Maryland
[1:05:24] but it doesn't mean that because I
[1:05:33] must look until I am at the right house
[1:05:41] now when we worship God
[1:05:44] we must come to a point
[1:05:47] where we know exactly where he is
[1:05:58] then we must know
[1:06:00] how far is he finances
[1:06:04] is he from us
[1:06:08] if we don't know that um that is why the
[1:06:12] Bible speaks about
[1:06:13] the Rapture
[1:06:15] it says it's a sacred Rapture
[1:06:21] now if it's a sacred one um
[1:06:29] we cannot not worship God
[1:06:33] that we don't know a single mass and
[1:06:36] then we should know also our
[1:06:38] coordination
[1:06:44] what relationship has got with us
[1:06:50] how does he communicate with us
[1:06:55] Abraham God said unto him
[1:06:58] get out of this land
[1:07:00] go to the promises
[1:07:03] so he went out
[1:07:06] to the promised land
[1:07:08] now to the promised land um he was
[1:07:12] supposed to get a promise
[1:07:15] so he didn't just relax
[1:07:19] no he wanted
[1:07:21] so he left his home while she came alive
[1:07:24] and he came to this place so he must
[1:07:27] receive the promise
[1:07:30] until one day
[1:07:33] he met God but in a form of a man God
[1:07:37] was
[1:07:38] then he knew
[1:07:40] this is the man
[1:07:43] now how did he knows Abraham
[1:07:48] he knew was he because of the inner man
[1:07:52] again
[1:07:53] in him when God
[1:07:57] created Adam
[1:07:59] I said to you
[1:08:01] took his own soul
[1:08:03] and put it in Adam was
[1:08:10] the body like myself
[1:08:12] just like you and me
[1:08:15] now but God the difference was that his
[1:08:20] soul was that of course
[1:08:27] it speaks to us
[1:08:33] as as as Paul said yeah
[1:08:37] verse 22 verse 22 he said I Delight in
[1:08:41] the law of God after the inward man
[1:08:47] otherwise
[1:08:50] the two Natures will will always fight
[1:08:53] you um
[1:08:59] but he said there's an inward man in you
[1:09:04] know Abraham Abraham knew what he wanted
[1:09:12] in his inward man
[1:09:16] um
[1:09:20] put a a gave you a soul um
[1:09:25] that's where he communicates with you
[1:09:29] whenever I want to speak to you um speak
[1:09:33] to you through yourself
[1:09:36] because the prophet says
[1:09:44] when he came down um
[1:09:47] God has got no beginning
[1:09:50] he is
[1:09:55] good no relatives
[1:10:02] now how can you imagine
[1:10:05] recognize such a person
[1:10:16] that's the man you are waiting foreign
[1:10:20] man who's supposed to come and pick you
[1:10:22] up here um
[1:10:23] how are we together amen now he must
[1:10:27] create a place in you finally Italian so
[1:10:31] that when this body
[1:10:33] as the Bible says
[1:10:43] must take his position finally attaching
[1:10:46] so whenever one of us has departed
[1:10:50] um
[1:10:51] we come to remember about that body yes
[1:10:56] because that's the body
[1:11:00] that could recognize our Lord Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ
[1:11:05] that is the body that can point him
[1:11:11] together
[1:11:12] so now when Abraham um Abraham met him
[1:11:17] the Bible says the probability
[1:11:20] he gave him the tidings are always right
[1:11:24] amen and one what did God do I remember
[1:11:28] it was a man
[1:11:30] it was just a human being
[1:11:32] and then
[1:11:34] God was in that human being
[1:11:37] and Abraham was also a human being
[1:11:41] but you could see him through the soul
[1:11:43] that was in his heart
[1:11:48] they commune about Earth communion
[1:11:53] Prophet repeats and says
[1:11:56] gave of himself
[1:12:12] now what was in Abraham
[1:12:17] what was in God
[1:12:20] because it was it was one in the same
[1:12:22] thing
[1:12:24] that is why the Bible speaks about it
[1:12:27] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:30] he was a human being
[1:12:33] now we have read UTI
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:13:49] the old lady
[1:13:54] was always at the service
[1:13:58] and then
[1:14:01] she was the only one that could not
[1:14:04] understand the languages that we speak
[1:14:08] but she had her own interpreter while
[1:14:12] she has any interpreter okay now if you
[1:14:15] could take any in the old woman yeah
[1:14:20] um
[1:14:23] and find that they are speaking English
[1:14:27] never come back
[1:14:32] she would say these people are talking a
[1:14:35] strange thing
[1:14:36] but now the old lady
[1:14:38] was every Sunday
[1:14:42] now what does that mean
[1:14:45] it means that when you hear the word of
[1:14:48] God
[1:14:49] um
[1:14:50] you don't hear it from your intelligence
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:15:01] are we together man so when you hear it
[1:15:04] from the soul um
[1:15:06] look John first John chapter 3.
[1:15:14] the children of God does not sin um
[1:15:19] because the seed remains in him
[1:15:25] now the seed of God is the word of God
[1:15:32] when the word of God is preached um
[1:15:35] the word easy it's spelled within you
[1:15:41] remember the Bible says
[1:15:54] the Bible says when his word
[1:15:58] um comes out of his mouth
[1:16:02] when he sends it um when he preach it um
[1:16:06] that word will never miss a Target
[1:16:12] when it reaches the time
[1:16:19] it will accomplish this Affairs now it
[1:16:24] all depends on the predestination
[1:16:27] I was preaching at the uh brother Palace
[1:16:32] funeral
[1:16:34] I read the scripture
[1:16:37] in a book of uh
[1:16:43] the Bible says
[1:16:46] there are those that were
[1:16:49] ordained for condemnation
[1:16:54] then I read again the book of Acts
[1:16:59] chapter 13.
[1:17:01] that's 48 verse 48 it says there are
[1:17:05] those that are ordained for eternal life
[1:17:10] there are those that are ordained for
[1:17:13] condemnation
[1:17:16] there are those that are ordained for
[1:17:19] eternal life
[1:17:22] then what I quoted
[1:17:25] is that now there are three kinds of
[1:17:28] people in the world
[1:17:31] those that believe God
[1:17:34] those that pretends
[1:17:38] and those that don't believe God
[1:17:42] that is why in the judgment
[1:17:46] will be three types of people
[1:17:48] is in touch the Bible says
[1:17:54] today
[1:17:55] you repent and be baptized in the name
[1:17:59] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:02] and recognized
[1:18:05] the ministry
[1:18:09] of the day you are living in England
[1:18:13] there is this thing called
[1:18:16] uh when when I mean God is moving
[1:18:21] there's what we call dispensations
[1:18:25] now the dispensations
[1:18:28] is what God will be doing at what time
[1:18:33] you can worship God but it all depends
[1:18:37] on the dispensation
[1:18:39] we see peace card
[1:18:41] now when God
[1:18:44] sent Moses
[1:18:46] to Egypt Egypt to take them out of
[1:18:50] Israel there's no other option
[1:18:54] if you don't hear Moses humongous or
[1:18:56] Moses you miss a point
[1:18:59] now that that is a dispensation
[1:19:06] and when Moses Moses take them out ever
[1:19:10] keeper and cross the Red Sea bowel move
[1:19:14] and cross the desert
[1:19:15] this is finito with his job
[1:19:19] then somebody else takes over
[1:19:23] it's Joshua who let them cross there
[1:19:27] also
[1:19:30] um
[1:19:32] give them their inheritance if you
[1:19:36] remain with the the the the ministry of
[1:19:39] Moses
[1:19:41] foreign
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:20:11] born our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:15] walk upon the sea
[1:20:18] walk of
[1:20:20] right amen but now magic what is he
[1:20:25] doing is he still working upon this
[1:20:27] Wednesday
[1:20:29] you need to know
[1:20:32] what is he doing now
[1:20:35] do what you are supposed to do bestie
[1:20:38] Wednesday local funny Wednesday March
[1:20:40] because he gave us promises
[1:20:43] and those promises are Divine
[1:20:47] in the book of Peter he says
[1:20:51] give us Divine promises
[1:20:54] because God is divine
[1:20:57] in this nature is divine
[1:21:00] now the Divine promises will never
[1:21:04] perish
[1:21:06] they will always be divine
[1:21:10] if you follow those divine
[1:21:40] right amen
[1:21:42] he didn't mean
[1:21:45] that his father is amen
[1:22:18] that was the ministry
[1:22:22] if you don't see the father um
[1:22:26] in Jesus which is
[1:22:29] then you missed a point again
[1:22:32] that is why he was always saying
[1:22:34] when man sees me um
[1:22:37] what do they say but he that I mean the
[1:22:42] son of man M um
[1:22:45] you see that's what you want to know
[1:22:48] yeah was that they must know who he is
[1:22:54] doesn't care whether they are going to
[1:22:57] execute him or do whatever but as long
[1:23:00] as one person
[1:23:05] who can have that Revelation Ministries
[1:23:11] I mean not just wise
[1:23:14] he said to to Peter
[1:23:16] when Peter said um
[1:23:21] what what is who is Christ
[1:23:25] is God himself
[1:23:30] what was this it was the spirit
[1:23:33] seven rainbows
[1:23:36] then they came together
[1:23:39] and formed the pillar of fire yes
[1:23:43] that is logos
[1:23:45] that is Christ
[1:23:47] that is
[1:23:52] when God processed himself
[1:23:58] there was no father there
[1:24:01] himself
[1:24:03] taking the duty of the sun
[1:24:07] Christ
[1:24:09] right when Peter said um now at the
[1:24:14] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:24:17] he said to him
[1:24:20] Flesh and Blood
[1:24:22] he's not revealed
[1:24:24] exactly what Abraham saw
[1:24:27] what is in you
[1:24:30] read your Bible it says
[1:24:40] the ministry was that going to Jerusalem
[1:24:47] because now Governor is time is
[1:24:52] revealed himself
[1:24:56] foreign
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:24] not even the angels
[1:25:27] but only there the father who Bob now if
[1:25:32] you want to know his day
[1:25:37] then you need to be a father magic
[1:25:39] finale
[1:25:42] because
[1:25:44] that is the boiling point
[1:25:47] if you're waiting for the coming of the
[1:25:49] Lord
[1:25:51] and then he says
[1:25:55] even the angels
[1:25:57] even the Santa is
[1:26:03] so the right way to know that is
[1:26:08] that you must pave your way
[1:26:11] and become the father then you will know
[1:26:20] because even the promises
[1:26:28] that I am in the farm
[1:26:40] you see if it's I in you um
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:58] he'll come like a Thief in the Night
[1:27:01] episode but the Bible says only the
[1:27:05] father knows
[1:27:06] now that is a dispensation
[1:27:10] we're talking about it is
[1:27:14] the ministry is that now
[1:27:18] Joshua Joshua
[1:27:20] took them in they crossed the river
[1:27:22] children
[1:27:58] um
[1:28:15] will never give you a wrong position
[1:28:21] and what the prophet says in Prophet
[1:28:23] says the holy spirit
[1:28:25] will raise this man the Joshua paramise
[1:28:35] give you your inheritance
[1:28:39] the one misplace you and Gage
[1:28:43] Joshua never misplaced you because your
[1:28:46] position
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:50] are we together I mean your position is
[1:28:53] the revealed way
[1:28:56] and and when your the word is revealed
[1:28:59] um
[1:29:00] you see your position in New Jerusalem
[1:29:08] you will know your
[1:29:18] if the word is in a human being
[1:29:21] what is the word
[1:29:25] Funda John 10. I think it's verse 35 or
[1:29:30] verse 35 it says it the one who the word
[1:29:34] of God is in him
[1:29:38] no let's let's not interpret it let's
[1:29:40] read it
[1:29:42] John chapter 10.
[1:29:49] now here I'm reading verse 35
[1:29:56] let's start here from the state as if
[1:30:01] I and my father are one
[1:30:04] minute
[1:30:05] not speaking about two things
[1:30:09] then the Jews took up stones again to
[1:30:13] Stone him Ahmad
[1:30:17] why do they want to Stone you
[1:30:20] must answer them
[1:30:23] many good works have I showed you images
[1:30:28] from my father
[1:30:30] for which of these Works do you Stone me
[1:30:33] mentioning
[1:30:37] the Jews answered him saying
[1:30:40] for a good work
[1:30:42] s
[1:30:45] but for the blasphemy
[1:30:48] and because that thou being a man makers
[1:30:52] thyself God
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:57] see now they say you are a human being
[1:31:00] don't make yourself
[1:31:03] to them that was blasphemy good boy
[1:31:07] listen to what
[1:31:10] Jesus said
[1:31:12] now Jesus answered them which is
[1:31:16] not written in your law what is
[1:31:26] if you call them Gods women
[1:31:31] and to whom the word of God came
[1:31:35] and the scripture cannot be broken
[1:31:41] when the word of God um
[1:31:46] it forms God in you
[1:31:50] when you depart from this world um
[1:32:14] foreign what if our lord Jesus comes um
[1:32:26] so what is the next step
[1:32:30] right amen the next step is a promise
[1:32:33] but there will be the battle
[1:32:37] according to Ezekiel 38.
[1:32:40] you won't be here
[1:32:43] the one that will be remaining here
[1:32:46] will be the one that says
[1:32:55] then that makes you a
[1:32:58] foolishness
[1:33:00] because the Bible says they were waiting
[1:33:04] in Matthew 25.
[1:33:07] for the coming Master figure
[1:33:22] what does the Holy Spirit do um
[1:33:26] you read I won't read it I'll quote it
[1:33:28] is
[1:33:35] there's a lot of things that I can tell
[1:33:38] you the name is
[1:33:46] now that will interpret what I uh what
[1:33:50] you can Crush
[1:33:54] when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:33:57] he will interpret what you don't
[1:34:00] understand
[1:34:02] now when they were waiting
[1:34:05] um
[1:34:08] which is
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:12] some didn't have that oil
[1:34:15] when he comes um
[1:34:24] those that are having
[1:34:31] are we together amen because the Bible
[1:34:34] says
[1:34:37] he will separate people
[1:34:40] like a
[1:34:43] Shepherds separating the sheep from God
[1:34:49] there's a type
[1:34:52] that he took with him
[1:34:55] he will come back with those people
[1:34:59] white horses
[1:35:04] are we together amen
[1:35:07] so now when at the Judgment seat is
[1:35:12] he would be sitting with those people
[1:35:15] no we know Peter said yes what are we
[1:35:19] going to gain yes
[1:35:27] don't worry you'll judge angels
[1:35:32] together amen you'll sit with me in my
[1:35:35] church
[1:35:41] those that will never be charged
[1:35:44] directly to the Lake of Fire
[1:35:49] those are the angel that kept not their
[1:35:52] first estate
[1:35:56] then there comes now
[1:35:58] the people now
[1:36:00] the ordinary people
[1:36:04] and the foolish virgins
[1:36:14] then he's going to say to them
[1:36:18] Follow the Leader
[1:36:21] um holy and then he will say to the
[1:36:23] others
[1:36:25] welcome
[1:36:28] they went through the word and those
[1:36:30] will never go to the city
[1:36:34] they will come in
[1:36:37] to bring honor ugleta indoors
[1:36:44] I said to you even if it's a memorial
[1:36:48] service
[1:36:54] watching what I've been preaching to the
[1:36:56] old lady that is
[1:37:03] she called herself the bride of Christ
[1:37:07] and then when the world and when it says
[1:37:11] the word is now in the bride um
[1:37:18] some people
[1:37:21] think that when the Bible speaks about
[1:37:24] the lake foreign
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:38:14] now some other people say
[1:38:19] please
[1:38:22] yeah tell them that we are coming later
[1:38:25] away for us there's nothing like that
[1:38:31] I died the death
[1:38:34] what do you call death threat I died
[1:38:38] my father or my grandfather
[1:38:42] um
[1:38:48] now take the word of God
[1:38:51] while there's still time who says in his
[1:38:55] card how are we together amen because
[1:38:58] after that
