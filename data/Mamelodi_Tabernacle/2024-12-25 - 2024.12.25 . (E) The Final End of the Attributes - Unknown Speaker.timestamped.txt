[2:43:22] Christian is somebody with somebody
[2:43:31] inside you read these things you
[2:43:36] understand that's the real
[2:43:41] Christian you are not a Christian
[2:43:43] because you read the
[2:43:46] Bible you are a Christian

[2:44:37] [Applause]
[2:44:43] nature before I finalize
[2:44:51] that's
[2:44:54] why actually
[2:44:57] my my
[2:45:01] title I've got it from
[2:45:06] Brother the final it says the final
[2:45:11] end of the attributes
[2:45:19] say they will do exactly like
[2:45:23] Abraham they bear the
[2:45:29] side all right
[2:45:34] amen the final
[2:45:40] end
[2:45:43] of he said it will
[2:45:45] happen again to the final end
[2:45:51] of the
[2:45:54] attributes amen M amen now
[2:45:58] before I close
[2:46:01] here now he says that that's my
[2:46:07] Prophet Hebrews

[2:47:03] uh is the
[2:47:05] page what you
[2:47:08] need is to
[2:47:13] meet then we'll come to where he says
[2:47:19] have you met
[2:47:23] MC since the battle is
[2:47:32] over and that's
[2:47:35] why what he did to
[2:47:39] Abraham the same thing he will
[2:47:43] do he will do the same thing to
[2:47:47] you as of the Seed of
[2:47:54] Abraham okay amen yeah I
