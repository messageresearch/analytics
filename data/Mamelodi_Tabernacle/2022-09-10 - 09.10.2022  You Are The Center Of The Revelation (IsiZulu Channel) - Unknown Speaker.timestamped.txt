[1:50:50] the center of the Revelation is
[1:50:58] you know
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:02] um
[1:51:03] I'm going to base these things on
[1:51:07] in this way because
[1:51:13] the prophet speaks of back to the first
[1:51:16] day
[1:51:18] um
[1:51:21] after you have run your servants
[1:51:38] and he resurrected on the
[1:51:42] hey they are defense day
[1:51:52] is
[1:51:59] it now
[1:52:01] here we have the book Christ Christ is
[1:52:07] the mystery of God revealed last night
[1:52:13] it's a great subject is
[1:52:19] predestinated
[1:52:25] speak of the anointing
[1:52:32] foreign
[1:52:35] he because he is the anointed
[1:52:45] and his subjects are called Christians
[1:52:52] amen under that day
[1:52:55] anointing Japanese
[1:53:05] this book
[1:53:07] Christ is the mystery of
[1:53:11] language
[1:53:18] there is this part that says
[1:53:22] so it's Christ expressing himself to the
[1:53:26] individuals
[1:53:34] let this subject approach you again
[1:53:43] able to come
[1:53:47] not for your mommy not for your daddy
[1:53:49] not for your brother not for your sister
[1:53:51] but you see me is
[1:53:59] individuals should
[1:54:01] become the center where now
[1:54:08] amen
[1:54:10] is the day that
[1:54:12] it should be you and him
[1:54:19] I mean
[1:54:21] that day that is coming
[1:54:26] it's not you and your family or you and
[1:54:29] your friends okay
[1:54:35] it's you when
[1:54:38] you the individual
[1:54:44] there's this one part I don't know if
[1:54:48] ever I can
[1:54:50] come across it again
[1:55:00] one part says
[1:55:07] it's God in Mena
[1:55:13] that is manifestation
[1:55:20] I'm not talking about when
[1:55:22] preachers preaching the whole church is
[1:55:25] shouting hallelujah thank God I'm
[1:55:28] talking about you
[1:55:30] um
[1:55:33] foreign
[1:55:43] but we are talking about
[1:55:47] like it was Adam and God is
[1:55:58] then he would only address Adam White
[1:56:04] now it's God that is Page 64 of Christ
[1:56:10] is the mystery of God revealed maybe one
[1:56:15] day you will understand this
[1:56:18] the title itself epaper 64.

[2:00:03] as the prophet used to say
[2:00:08] potentially the Rapture is in you
