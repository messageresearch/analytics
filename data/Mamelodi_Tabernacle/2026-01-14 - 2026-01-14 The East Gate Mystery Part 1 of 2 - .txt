M so the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; We are just going to stand up and read the word of God for for just to add more blessings to what the Lord has given to us already. our pastors here. My soul is full with delight having our pastors here. Amen. Amen. As we turn to our Bibles, um I'm just going to read some uh two scriptures, the Lord willing. Genesis chapter 3 verse chapter 2:8 &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 2:8 &gt;&gt; and Genesis 3 22- 24 &gt;&gt; Galatians 3 verse 22- 24 sorry Chapter 3 verse 22 to 24. Amen. Amen. Brother, do you have this uh English Bible there? &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in there he put the man whom he had formed. Genesis 3 verse 22- 24. And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil. And now least he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever. Therefore, the Lord sent the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to the ground from when he was taken. So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. Let us pray. the eagles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because wherever the eagles are gathered, the wherever the cacus is, the eagles will be gathered. &gt;&gt; H we were taught by the prophet of God that the cacas is the word of God. So father we are this morning around the table of life just father to uh h uh to to receive from you the blessings that you have in store for us this morning. May you bless every brother and sister. Thanking you for the pastors that are with in our midst here this morning. Father, it's such a tremendous uh uh blessing to us to have them with us. They had traveled him from far away as it was so in the Bible. They came from east and west and they met in the center of life which is the word of God. We thank you for the revelation in our day that we are able to see and we have met one another under this word in Jesus Christ's name I pray for the blessings upon all the brothers and sisters gathered in this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated for &gt;&gt; Amen. We we thank God for the uh uh for this day. As we were traveling back from Petersburg, brother GMA u he said something that left me thinking more deeper. when he said we were here last Thursday for our service. Now, brother G says uh it was a very uh blessing message and maybe if we were together uh uh uh it would have been something more better. He was thinking uh upon those lines. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now uh now in my heart then I I thought of maybe taking a part of that message this morning. H as this is the the the the the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Now, if you read in the Bible, um the first man was placed eastward and the garden which was the headquarters of the man, the son of God and the daughter of God as the prophet says, was eastward. And uh we understand that when uh um the time they uh the serpent tarnish the program of God. So God drove men uh out the east gate and we are told uh of the prophet that uh that place was the place of worship. This is gate was the place of worship. So I want to speak uh to bring a subject on that h point the east gate mystery. Amen. And uh as we I'm going to quote some few things here uh for the message believers. message. &gt;&gt; Now my text is going to be coming back east. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh now in the book of revelation Genesis the Bible says and uh and God said let there be light. That is verse three. And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God deliver divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day. Now, I looked into a book where scientists were trying to uh uh h interpret this this light and and one of them he said we don't know about this light. Why? Because uh this was not a natural light. And if you read in the book uh it is the rising of the sun is the rising and the prophet says the first light was the spoken word. He says when God said let there be light, that light was the spoken word. Because the Bible says in the beginning was light was the word and the word was the light of men. And the Bible again if I I'm going to read some things here. Now the morning the Bible says &gt;&gt; we are going back to these things and and the evening and the morning were the first day now not the morning and the evening &gt;&gt; the evening and the morning which evening Evening speaks of westing and morning speaks of east. Now we speak of the prophet speaks of the east people and the western people. The eastern people and the western people. &gt;&gt; The Jews and the Gentiles. And now we have come to realize that the evening and the morning &gt;&gt; is today called let me read it first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we went through that last time because the Bible says uh ju just read for me Thessalonians 5:1 to5 first Thessalonians &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse chapter 1 verse 5 &gt;&gt; chapter 5 verse 1-5 &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay it it it reads this But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thessalonians Thessalonians chapter 5. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Uh for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. Yeah, just read down to verse five, please. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord saw cometh as a thief in the night. Now, now in the Bible, we we we have the the first light which is supernatural and verse 14, we have the natural lights, natural lights. That's where we find we find the sun, the moon, the stars, and so forth. The Bible says it's for seasons. &gt;&gt; We have what the prophet calls the predestinated seasons and we have the natural seasons as we are the the bride is now in another season an an angelic season. angelic season. &gt;&gt; If we read here, &gt;&gt; um uh uh uh uh uh verse 14, &gt;&gt; verse 14, &gt;&gt; it says, "And God said, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, and to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. Verse 14. Verse 15. Okay. Verse 16 also say, "And God made two great lights. the great light for the uh to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. So all these things are for days and the seasons &gt;&gt; and the signs and years which is natural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Earthly. &gt;&gt; Amen. But re but but but Genesis 1:3 says, "And God said, let there be light, and there was light." And and so God saw the light that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness. So they were separated there, &gt;&gt; light and darkness and that was uh the first day. Now the first day of the week the Bible says here &gt;&gt; the first day of the week. &gt;&gt; Now we will understand that we have a supernatural first day and we have a natural first day. Now they went to the tomb both naturally and spiritually. So they celebrated the the resurrection even up today but it's natural and spiritual. If you you look at the book of Mark 16, I I read this part here. Uh we read this in Congo and the people were happy. Chapter 16 says, I mean, yeah, chapter 16 verse 9. &gt;&gt; Mark 16:9. Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, &gt;&gt; week is seven days. Now the first day of the week uh he appeared first to Mary Magdalene because Mary Magdalene type the church. So he appeared first not not to Peter and to or or to John but to Mary Magdalene. &gt;&gt; And we said last time in Congo the reason why he appeared to Mary Magdalene is because the Bible says out of whom he had cast seven demons. So it it it completely types the the seven church ages because the Lord has cast seven demons out of church ages seven church ages &gt;&gt; and now that church stands perfect before God as A BRIDE. AND THAT'S WHY NOW THE RESURRECTION is celebrated by this bride &gt;&gt; supernaturally. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it says here, it says here, &gt;&gt; um, out of whom he had cast seven demons, And she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept. The first person to announce the resurrection of the Lord was a woman. The first person to visit the tomb there or And the Bible says, "And 14, afterwards he appeared unto the 11 as they sat eating and braided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart. Because, listen, because they believed not those who had seen him after he had risen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Who are those? &gt;&gt; You are lost again. &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene &gt;&gt; after the resurrection. He appeared unto Mary Magdalene. &gt;&gt; Now shift from your head to your soul. Right. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says &gt;&gt; afterwards he appeared unto 11 upraided them with their unbelief and the hardness of the heart. because they believed not those who had seen him after he had risen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we read there is another resurrection in our day and the people even today don't believe those who had seen him after the resurrection in the last days. Those who had seen him after the resurrection in our day Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he said, "If a man believe me, I will raise him up at the last day." Now, uh if I may find that place, uh the prophet speaks of the resurrection in the last day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying not to read many things and uh so uh but I will read this part here speaking about the predestinated seed. Now, page 72, restoration of the bride. &gt;&gt; Page 72, restoration of the bride. &gt;&gt; It is Easter again for the true believers of his never failing word. It's Easter. It's resurrection. God's got people everywhere. It's Easter for them. &gt;&gt; They have risen from this Christian denominations. &gt;&gt; It's Easter again. &gt;&gt; The royal seed has been has been hid in the roots. &gt;&gt; has been hid in the roots. has been hid in the roots. &gt;&gt; The word he the word heat back here in the way. Okay, let me turn to this now. It's Easter time &gt;&gt; predestinated from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; The church is beginning to stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh we'll come back to this. &gt;&gt; But here the Bible says, &gt;&gt; uh I'm I'm back to the Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; I'm back to the Thessalonians. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. Now I'll go back to say the first light was supernatural. &gt;&gt; And now while you are holding on that, Ephesians chapter 5 &gt;&gt; tells me this. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; While you are holding on that, &gt;&gt; listen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5 tells me this. Ephesians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; I will read this part here. &gt;&gt; Uh verse 8, &gt;&gt; verse eight. &gt;&gt; For you were once darkness, &gt;&gt; but are now light. &gt;&gt; So when God spoke of darkness and light, you are speaking about people. the first light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh now it spoke of east and west, evening and the morning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Referring to the evening people and the morning people. referring to the Gentiles and the Jews. &gt;&gt; And uh now now reading here, &gt;&gt; for you were once darkness, &gt;&gt; but now are you light in the Lord? &gt;&gt; Walk as children of light. the sons of light. &gt;&gt; It's light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, back to Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; Now, as the sons of light, you read here again verse four. &gt;&gt; Verse four. But you brethren are not in darkness that that day should should overtake you as a thief. You you are all sons of light. Sons of the day, not this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and shoot and you are sons of the day. We we are not of night or of darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, let us not sleep as the others, but let us watch and be sober minded. For they that sleep sleep in the night. &gt;&gt; So, it's night time to some others here. in the night because a person uh for a person to sleep he needs darkness. So if you go you doze that means you are in darkness. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus appeared on the mountain. And uh the mountain was ablaze with light. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says Peter, John, and James slumbered. &gt;&gt; Today to them it was this site was light and this sight WAS DARKNESS. SO they doze away and in the mountain there the Lord Jesus stood there with Moses and Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now h now now we have two these two places and now I'm I'm going to read some few things for you here. Because now it speaks of the evening light of restoration. And the prophet says evening light come to shine same as in the morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know this this light shine is both for the people and its people &gt;&gt; as we we will see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this evening lights will not rise in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; The evening light goes where? IN THE WEST. AND THEY HAD THEIR day that is the east. They had their day in the east. They refused it. But now the evening light shall rise in the west. Now the Bible says the coming of the Lord, it is like lightning shining from the h one part of the earth to the other part. But now the prophet says it's now coming back east. Now that light in the east shineth also in the west that that's how a man TRAVELS and that's how the church travels east to WEST which is morning which is now east is morning. But if you you look in the Bible, it speaks of THE LAST WHICH is evening to morning because the last the last day. It's not morning and evening. The last day is evening AND MORNING. AND together they are called the evening light. &gt;&gt; The evening light means there's no more darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we you read here. Now it will start from west now to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; No, not not from Jerusalem to the uttermost. But it's now in the uttermost. It will start from the it will start from the uttermost to Jerusalem. So the prophet Elijah OF THE GENTILES THAT SPIRIT IS GOING back to Jerusalem. Amen. That that that's now it brings it back east. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when it comes back to east, &gt;&gt; it is now that evening light- &gt;&gt; which was the morning light. that traveled down to west and coming back again east. Now the whole thing is called the evening LIGHT which the seventh messenger tells you that is east and west. It's not now it's not two h parts or sides &gt;&gt; because the Jews and the Gentiles will now MEET and in the new Jerusalem we look at the foundation is Jewish &gt;&gt; and the whole building is gentile. and they share one light. That's why now Elijah of the Gentiles is going to the Jews. So it's one light traveling from the Gentiles to the Jews. that that same light traveled from the Jews to the GENTILES now at the end time is coming back east. But the thing is, how did it connect? &gt;&gt; This is what we were talking about on &gt;&gt; uh Thursday. H &gt;&gt; how did it connect? &gt;&gt; Because it is a connection of uh h the humans with the angels. Amen. Amen. That's why now uh the message of the hour has two parts. as you yourself have your theophony and your earthly dwelling place. &gt;&gt; And we have realized that &gt;&gt; there are seven seals. &gt;&gt; Seven seals were not written in the book. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. as you can't see your your theoph seals &gt;&gt; and he stopped shut off the seventh seal. Now when the people get at that point they get lost. BECAUSE the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "What blinded Israel, &gt;&gt; what blinded Israel &gt;&gt; was that man?" Hallelujah. He says, &gt;&gt; "When people expected to see God and they were expecting to see God, they saw a manal." Then the whole thing blinded them. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is in your book, The Unveiling of God. Unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "When they came to see God, they saw a man &gt;&gt; and that blinded them." &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "When he opened the seventh seal, It was all silent. &gt;&gt; And now the Gentiles are blind. &gt;&gt; Because as they are coming, as they come to see God, &gt;&gt; they are blinded by a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh the blindness is that God came down into a man and revealed the seals. Amen. Now what blinds them is they they they are expecting the seals to be revealed. But the thing is how God reveals them. This is this this is the thing that blinds them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were expecting Moses to deliver they were expecting Jehovah to deliver them out of Egypt. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he came to deliver them, the Bible says they didn't believe Moses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the the form of men blended them. &gt;&gt; God had to take now someh kilometers in order to bring them as he went now for Pharaoh. He went to Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says &gt;&gt; they didn't believe Moses. &gt;&gt; Even here after the resurrection, they didn't believe. Those who say came and and said to them, "We have seen the Lord." To them, he was buried. &gt;&gt; He's dead. &gt;&gt; To them, he was dead. &gt;&gt; So, he had to go some extra &gt;&gt; kilometers to to bring them to Jerusalem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we are reading here. &gt;&gt; Now the evening light is here to restore. Amen. Amen. And that is for the for the evening people. I will go this way now. Now as as the the the seventh seal &gt;&gt; is was the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; to to the bride. &gt;&gt; Now I I'm going to take it from this now. &gt;&gt; Now watch. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now the reason the reason here as a Thursday here we we we went that that far how a pastor said to me I now understand the reason why the prophet was supposed to go rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let let me read it to you again. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
