insurance because you know that anytime it can go accidental we know this is not a place we can live forever foreign babies without having even experience you know there's people that has gone without seeing what we have seen they slept while they were still young amen testimony they don't have a testimony they can give or of this world now others God has kept us foreign for just for a few minutes you can amen amen dear heavenly father thou creator of the Heaven and the earth once again this morning here we are standing before you yes you spoke the word in the beginning with your holy prophets you wrote the Bible father we are so honored we appreciate this great moment whereby father your word is still the same yesterday to then forever it takes us back when we came to the word when you call us sister mayappa here was the one to welcome us together with how Lord you have used them together with our pastor helping us growing up until today spiritually is her body we know Lord that one day this body is going to go down lord but our spirit our souls are committed to thee here's a service that you have given to us through your Prophet Lord revealing the word that you spoke in the beginning that if we repent Lord and we accept your word we have passed from Death unto life father this morning we ask for your spirit yes we ask for your power Lord to come down now to speak to us Comfort the family because we know that we come from eternity we are going back to Eternity Father Here is our pastor standing before us special anointing today to deliver once again the word because through the word you created everything the things that we can see and things that we cannot see with our Naked Eyes we know Lord that those who have received your word the end time message the spoken word which is the original seat as our mama was they've passed from Death To Life Lord even now as your word is going to come forth may it Comfort us Lord bless everything that's going to be done in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen and where is my ah are you there brother okay and First Corinthians chapter 15 and chapter verse 22. 22 First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 22. for us in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive okay thank you amen amen you may be seated okay or um God bless them with children and Grand children may they be comforted according to the word of God and they're here we find in the scriptures foreign foreign so we only know of death and the life and yeah that's the natural and the spiritual Lea small okay forgive us for the world I mean okay and all the relatives sons and daughters and we are so glad and some of them are here as Christians and you know about Christianity that's why the decision is made why while one is alive and you should know where you are going then you will know where you are coming that's why he says Adam foreign [Music] was here in the form of men are alligator he looks so much like us until even today some we don't accept him as God because this word was made flesh and dwelt among us and so it looks so much today we don't know who Christ is but if you are not if you are born again and then you have another birth which is spiritual healing yeah [Music] who died I was just reading this part where it says the blood of Jesus Christ you know it's not just it's not that the human blood he's black the Bible says it's the blood of God and we understand that is saved us from sin and when we were Sinners and he took our form we our chairman died for us to redeem us you know you all know Redemption to take something back to his original contribution amen so what we used to be really sauna the Adams it is like we always repeat the same thing uh the other one that was also born there was some predictions and now you can compare my mother passed away when she was 90. just there I mean I thank God because she was a Christian uh she believed in God who has created amen right now for few minutes for us in Adam or die to die is to separate who will be separated or to separate you die that's what the River Jordan meant uh even what what they do I want you to ensure it before you drive it out you can crush the very same moment after leaving the garage [Music] so in Christ shall all be made alive they shall not crash in you go Europe a very same scripture here verse 44. it says of our body is shown in it is shown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual voice amen amen we have this one goes into hospital and so forth I think before we started off for this place many of us have taken some tables it is this body amen amen and will keep on taking tables [Music] we stop taking things when we shall have changed into an eternal body you know because this body is not eternity be a king that's why we have history but in heaven there's no history she knew about it [Music] it can keep me forever that body of yours cannot keep you forever foreign [Music] [Music] is uh there's a brother here we went to this Undertaker amen yes I'm in a box yeah I'm in a box and then they saw you know but this one is bleeding yeah but it's a box you know I can put on a suit and try to do this amen he came to my house [Music] there will be a soon and died but he was saying that joking well today you are saying it because you are still working and talking everything but there is one day that is going to be [Music] you know today they are in the sixth Dimensions only they won't come back here they are waiting for US foreign you can look at the events you can see that there's no more time the world is is drifting towards the tribulation those who understand look at the things today the mind of a young man and uh you know young women the other one they call you know here no in in Adam all died all right amen now death look who is separation because they are dead even though they are alive a person who is who is dead who does not even know that God opposite uh or satanism uh and you wonder today how can a man choose Satan who instead of the Lord Jesus Christ but God has the answer to all this which comes by predestination you were predestinated before the foundation of the world God knew all about you will be here this morning and then the person who has received the Lord Jesus Christ who is against Christianity he was also predestinated foreign by the blood of God you know I was just reading that the blood the word that we have received is that blood because when uh when God shows through he should come through a woman the angel came and then now this Angel who has this Angel hey Gabriel Gabriel the angel came to Mary your favorites then what happened uh this Angel spoke to me and finally Mary because she was a virgin she didn't understand the angels He said how come because I have no man amen amen and then he saw Charlie because that what what the angel was talking about was not human seeds the seed of God now the seed of God was that way foreign according to your way amen amen the power is in the way amen so then that word by Gabriel to her man foreign foreign but not in this age because we shall put on immortality from this amen when I shall he shall she she has already immortality in the sixth Dimensions amen she's waiting for the for your children she's waiting for us and she is younger than you are today she doesn't take tables amen amen all right now yeah really more you are looking all at the at this image which is if if you were given this picture but it go to the
