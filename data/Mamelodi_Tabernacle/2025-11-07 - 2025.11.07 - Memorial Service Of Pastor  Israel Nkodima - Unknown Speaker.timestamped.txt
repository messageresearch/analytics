[35:59] Let us pray.
[36:04] Dear God,
[36:08] as we are gathering tonight in this all,
[36:12] oh Lord,
[36:15] with our hearts broken
[36:19] and bleeding,
[36:22] realizing, oh Lord,
[36:25] there is someone who should have be here
[36:29] with us
[36:31] and he's not here.
[36:35] Oh Lord,
[36:38] this is
[36:41] a big vacuum that he has left.
[36:47] We cannot feel his presence physically,
[36:51] but we know that spiritually he's still
[36:55] here with us.
[36:59] Lord, even if he's not here physically,
[37:03] but we come here to celebrate his life,
[37:08] to remember that your servant
[37:12] was a soldier
[37:14] and he fought the battle and he winded.
[37:20] Yes, Lord.
[37:23] We know that he has finished his mission
[37:26] here on earth
[37:28] and is no more this side of eternity
[37:31] with us.
[37:33] But he is in that other side, oh Lord.
[37:37] And we know that he still lives
[37:41] because the Christian cannot die.
[37:45] His
[37:46] spirit
[37:48] and his legacy still live among us. Oh
[37:52] Lord, he was an example for us, oh Lord,
[37:56] of humility,
[37:58] of power,
[38:00] and he is still an example for us, oh
[38:03] Lord, because we are just following the
[38:08] footstep
[38:09] on the sand of time. I we know that. Oh
[38:13] Lord is now resting.
[38:17] We know that our Lord is no more
[38:20] suffering in his blood in his sh in his
[38:22] shame. We know our Lord is not in rest
[38:26] in peace.
[38:28] And we come here to remember what he has
[38:32] during his trip here on earth. And we
[38:36] come here to remember with our speeches,
[38:40] our tributes and everything. And songs
[38:44] that he was here among us and uh he left
[38:48] a good examples for all the ministers
[38:52] because even if he's not here physically
[38:55] but his ministry and the gifts that was
[38:58] in his body
[39:01] impacted so many lives
[39:04] not here only in South Africa but all
[39:08] over the world and in Africa. The
[39:11] ministry of that humble man,
[39:14] not simple a a man of God, but a man
[39:19] sent from God was impacted many of us.
[39:24] Oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[39:28] we thank you for pastor Israel Kodima.
[39:32] We thank you for his life. We thank you
[39:36] for his big ministry. We thank you for
[39:40] the gift that he has put in his life. We
[39:44] thank you for his humility,
[39:47] his love and how he was a simple among
[39:51] us. Oh Lord, he was a help for every one
[39:56] of us Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:59] Jesus, oh Lord, we pray that you may
[40:04] give us a spirit, the spirit of love, a
[40:08] spirit of unity.
[40:11] We need you now more than ever. Lord, we
[40:16] need you among us, oh Lord. Take over
[40:21] all of this this hole and control our
[40:25] spirits and everything that will be done
[40:27] here.
[40:28] We need the love that we seen in his
[40:31] life. We need the spirit of unity. Oh
[40:35] Lord, we need you in among us. We need
[40:39] the Holy Ghost to take over because it
[40:43] was not a man that was guiding us, but
[40:46] it was Elohim himself
[40:49] veiled in the human flesh to guide his
[40:53] church and to guide his bride. Jesus
[40:56] Christ, we commit everything unto your
[40:58] hands. We commit the program unto your
[41:01] hands. And the man, the pastor Madiva,
[41:04] who is the director of the program, we
[41:06] commit him also unto your hands. And the
[41:09] songs and everything
[41:11] begin with us, oh Lord, as Alpha and uh
[41:16] go to the end with us as omega because
[41:20] we ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[51:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:18] [music]
[51:18] &gt;&gt; It's not working. All right. Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Uh the next item on the program,
[51:27] [music] it will be a speech by the
[51:29] family representative
[51:32] is brother [music] Masumba.
[51:35] But be as he comes to the four,
[51:39] I want us to ask all the pastors that
[51:42] are here,
[51:46] anyone that is a pastor, [singing]
[51:50] if you can all stand [music] to your
[51:51] feet,
[51:54] so that the whole congregation can
[51:55] welcome you with a round of applause.
[52:00] Let's have all the pastors standing on
[52:02] their feet. [music]
[52:10] Hallelujah.
[52:11] Hallelujah.
[52:13] Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; God bless your pastors.
[52:18] Pastor [music] had such a high regard
[52:20] for pastors
[52:24] as you take your seats.
[52:27] As brother Masa
[52:30] as he comes to the four.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music]
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And then as he's coming,
[52:39] I'm going to request the speakers
[52:43] just to be conscious of time
[52:47] and we want the program to be orderly.
[52:53] I believe that we all know that Pastor
[52:54] Gurimo was a man that loved order.
[53:00] I remember there was a time
[53:03] We were at a certain place, I won't
[53:06] mention the name
[53:08] and we were having a convention
[53:11] and then we were booked into a guest
[53:13] house as pastors
[53:16] and then in the morning
[53:20] was moving from room to room
[53:24] not realizing that he was making an
[53:26] inspection
[53:28] in Then he came to my room.
[53:32] Luckily, I had made up my bed.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And then he walked in
[53:38] &gt;&gt; and he says,
[53:43] "And those other men, they did not make
[53:45] they did not make their beds."
[53:46] &gt;&gt; It says, "Speak to them
[53:50] so that they make up their beds."
[53:52] It says, "Because if we don't make up
[53:54] our beds,
[53:56] this guest house will think that we are
[53:58] disorderly."
[54:01] then they will not believe our gospel
[54:04] if we are disorderly.
[54:07] So tonight I expect us to be orderly
[54:12] as we reflect on the life of this giant
[54:15] of faith.
[54:19] God bless you. And immediately after
[54:22] brother Masuma
[54:26] after he has made his speech
[54:29] we are going to requested the
[54:30] Switzerland believers
[54:33] just to join brother
[54:37] and we're going to sing
[54:42] the song that pastor loved.
[54:45] God bless you.
[54:50] Across the bridge, [singing]
[54:54] [music]
[54:55] there's no more sorrow.
[54:59] [music]
[55:00] Across the bridge,
[55:07] [music]
[55:11] [singing]
[55:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[55:20] [music]
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Heat.
[55:27] Heat. [music]
[55:32] [music and singing]
[55:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.
[55:42] [singing]
[55:46] [music]
[55:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[55:56] [music]
[56:02] [music]
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[56:08] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[56:13] Uh this is a song
[56:18] that our pastor
[56:21] He really loved.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] And we as the
[56:30] masugas
[56:33] and the mabas,
[56:35] we were really blessed,
[56:39] to have a father,
[56:42] to have a grandfather,
[56:45] to have a pastor,
[56:48] to have a god in a man.
[56:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:59] to us.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He was a he was a father.
[57:04] He was a pastor.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; We would
[57:14] at times when we would love to have a
[57:16] conversation with him
[57:19] about the family matters.
[57:22] He would accommodate us as much as
[57:30] things he also accommodate us.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Really we were blessed.
[57:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:40] Now I was so blessed especially on my
[57:43] side
[57:47] because if we lay next to the pastor
[57:52] while I was a young boy
[58:00] being a man like this
[58:03] is because of his teachings.
[58:10] I've been with him several times
[58:15] while we still fellowshipping at the
[58:17] school
[58:19] at the school name
[58:21] &gt;&gt; and then we move also to
[58:27] in this ministry
[58:29] &gt;&gt; with him.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And there's about almost 45
[58:34] years
[58:36] in this ministry
[58:41] working with him
[58:42] &gt;&gt; up until
[58:45] God remembers him
[58:48] and I'm going to continue
[58:51] walk
[58:55] &gt;&gt; where he taught me to walk.
[59:00] [music]
[59:01] Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then another thing
[59:05] when we start
[59:11] school,
[59:20] we we were the ones responsible for
[59:22] starting.
[59:24] We the mafiris.
[59:28] I think
[59:32] they know about it
[59:35] because
[59:39] we would sing together with singing.
[59:42] And then as as
[59:46] time goes on, we moved.
[59:54] and I was a chorus leader there
[59:58] at the same time
[1:00:00] at the same time.
[1:00:03] [music]
[1:00:03] So
[1:00:06] it shows us my pastor
[1:00:10] all the way
[1:00:13] even
[1:00:15] in the family they know it very well.
[1:00:21] funeral
[1:00:23] Sundays
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; that when there's funerals over the
[1:00:25] weekends on Saturdays
[1:00:29] to come they know that
[1:00:32] because it's God first.
[1:00:36] So
[1:00:39] that's how he has taught us that God
[1:00:42] come first
[1:00:45] [music]
[1:00:46] and these other things
[1:00:48] they shall follow. So we as the family,
[1:00:53] we want to thank the Lord
[1:00:56] with such a precious gift
[1:01:02] within the family,
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; the one that God gave us in the family.
[1:01:05] So we'll keep on going forward
[1:01:09] until we meet him.
[1:01:12] God bless.
[1:01:17] God bless you.

[1:10:26] and we are not afraid."

[1:15:42] our pastor as well
[1:15:45] we have lost a great man indeed.
[1:15:50] He was not an ordinary
[1:15:54] He was a supernatural.
[1:15:57] I'm so touched this evening
[1:16:00] because what I see
[1:16:03] is what he told me
[1:16:07] since he started sick
[1:16:10] until he depart.
[1:16:12] I was always there.
[1:16:15] Not some days.
[1:16:18] Every day
[1:16:20] I was with the pastor
[1:16:23] every day.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; He was our shepherd.
[1:16:28] He loved us.
[1:16:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; He taught us God's word.
[1:16:36] He prayed with us
[1:16:38] and he helped us in good times and hard
[1:16:41] time.
[1:16:43] He was a great man indeed.
[1:16:46] This life shows us how to follow Christ.
[1:16:53] Yes, we cry.
[1:16:56] We miss him.
[1:16:58] He He was very much aware as well. He
[1:17:00] was very much as aware as well.
[1:17:04] But the Bible says, "Blessed are those
[1:17:07] who mourn,
[1:17:10] for they will be comforted."
[1:17:14] Amen. Amen. Pastor will tell us that
[1:17:19] do not say sad.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Christ has won over death.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And our pastor now
[1:17:29] is in the sixth dimension
[1:17:32] where he was always telling us about
[1:17:36] and this this God
[1:17:38] hold each other. Move forward. Let us
[1:17:42] leave the faith of our pastor.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Let us
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; let us save.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let us leave the faith of our
[1:17:50] pastor.

[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; So let me just tell you
[1:17:58] [music] few moments when I was with the
[1:18:01] pastor
[1:18:06] what he was saying.
[1:18:09] I I lost my job.
[1:18:13] But now I realize this was the will of
[1:18:15] God
[1:18:17] for losing the job.
[1:18:20] I went close to the pastor.
[1:18:22] Every day every night I was with him
[1:18:28] when he admitted at the hospital.
[1:18:32] I was there and brother Mashande was
[1:18:35] there and the family was there.
[1:18:39] when the pastor was admitted at the
[1:18:41] hospital [music]
[1:18:43] and a lot has happened.
[1:18:47] I'm just going to pick
[1:18:51] to save time.
[1:18:54] There was a time where the pastor
[1:18:56] departed [music] from this earth
[1:19:00] on the 22nd of July.
[1:19:03] I arrived in the morning and then after
[1:19:06] greeting me
[1:19:08] he said brother is the program ready
[1:19:12] I said yes pastor he said okay if the
[1:19:16] program is ready I'm happy and I started
[1:19:20] to explain
[1:19:22] pastor I'm preaching this weekend
[1:19:26] the other weekend is our elders kosana
[1:19:30] that other weekend is [music] pastor mua
[1:19:34] He said, "No, you don't understand me. I
[1:19:38] mean the program
[1:19:40] of the [music] funeral."
[1:19:43] Then I said,
[1:19:46] "No, pastor, you are not going to die
[1:19:50] because we will be in rapture together."
[1:19:54] He said, "Brother, I'm going you
[1:19:57] brothers
[1:19:59] continue. Jesus is here. take me back
[1:20:03] home.
[1:20:05] Then he said to me, I have finished
[1:20:08] preaching,
[1:20:11] so it's my time to go.
[1:20:14] That was around 9 half 9 between that
[1:20:18] time. 9.
[1:20:21] Then that day was not a nice day. But
[1:20:25] when the pastor said those words, he was
[1:20:28] happy. He was laughing out loud.
[1:20:32] I was just listening. I even said to
[1:20:35] Omar, "This one is bigger than me.
[1:20:39] Please talk to him. We
[1:20:41] [singing and music] not talk about death
[1:20:42] here. We need to talk about the
[1:20:44] rapture." But the pastor says he's
[1:20:46] going.
[1:20:49] Hey, the day goes
[1:20:53] 7:00 in the afternoon. 7:00,
[1:20:57] the pastor died.
[1:21:00] The nurses were crying
[1:21:02] were throwing out their bags.
[1:21:06] Then they closed the kitten.
[1:21:09] The only word I heard
[1:21:12] in an echo kind of off
[1:21:15] was
[1:21:18] when they were trying to resuscitate
[1:21:20] him.
[1:21:22] He was gone.
[1:21:25] After few minutes,
[1:21:28] he came back. Then he crack a [music]
[1:21:30] joke.
[1:21:35] What were you trying to do?
[1:21:38] And then that's how he came back and
[1:21:39] everybody started to laugh.
[1:21:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So he saw he's coming. He's going.
[1:21:49] But that time was not the time. She said
[1:21:54] to me, "Bru, the reason why I [music]
[1:21:58] came back, there are some few things I
[1:22:02] need to do, but when I'm done, I go."
[1:22:09] Amen. That's the one incident I
[1:22:12] experienced. Then the pastor [music]
[1:22:14] came out of hospital.
[1:22:16] We went to a private place in Bronos
[1:22:19] plate
[1:22:21] next to the dam
[1:22:24] where we were looking after him
[1:22:27] uh you know making sure he's healthier
[1:22:29] than before.
[1:22:31] And the other morning when I arrived
[1:22:34] from my house to see him,
[1:22:37] I found him smiling
[1:22:40] he said, "Bru, I saw the children of God
[1:22:43] in the rapture
[1:22:46] and you were part of that." I was happy.
[1:22:49] Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; So now he came out there. We went to his
[1:22:54] house. The pastor is fine. When I was in
[1:22:58] the house, one incident happened.
[1:23:02] You know, when I grew up in the message,
[1:23:05] I received the message in 1989.
[1:23:08] In 1990,
[1:23:10] I met the pastor when he was given the
[1:23:13] communion in Appeland.
[1:23:17] There's a school there called Marit.
[1:23:22] Then I met him again in Mali in 1992.
[1:23:27] There's a room in the pastor's house,
[1:23:31] upper room.
[1:23:34] I was told that room no one should
[1:23:36] enter.
[1:23:39] Then I was convinced you must not enter.
[1:23:43] One day the pastor says bro, let's go in
[1:23:46] that room. I was so frightened
[1:23:49] because they [singing] say is a no-go
[1:23:52] room.
[1:23:54] When we enter there,
[1:23:56] We sit down. He said, "Don't be shaken.
[1:23:59] Just relax. Let's just talk."
[1:24:03] Then we talk
[1:24:06] very nice things. And I believe many
[1:24:09] people never entered in that room. I was
[1:24:13] there with the pastor. Then the other
[1:24:16] day he called me again. He said,
[1:24:19] "Brother, my beard are long.
[1:24:22] Help me to shave." We were together in
[1:24:25] the room. We were talking and it was
[1:24:28] nice. Let me not say only the nice
[1:24:31] things only. Let me tell you what I
[1:24:33] experienced. One of the days I messed up
[1:24:38] after messing up. I went to the pastor.
[1:24:42] We were in that room.
[1:24:45] When we were there, I said, "Pastor, I
[1:24:48] messed up. I was preaching and I said
[1:24:52] some of the things that maybe I was not
[1:24:54] supposed to say then I need to fix that
[1:24:58] behind the pullpit. Then the pastor said
[1:25:02] narrate the story. Narrate the story. I
[1:25:05] narrated the story. After that he said
[1:25:08] brother I was dreaming there was nothing
[1:25:11] wrong. You know what? Even myself when I
[1:25:16] preach not everybody will believe me.
[1:25:19] Brother, preach this gospel. Go forward.
[1:25:23] They will love you. They will not love
[1:25:25] you. Let's continue going forward
[1:25:28] closely.
[1:25:30] After preaching my last sermon
[1:25:33] in Modi, I was flying to Zambia. Then I
[1:25:38] went to see the pastor for the prayer of
[1:25:41] the traveling man.
[1:25:44] After the prayer, he hold my hand. He
[1:25:47] said, "Brother, I'm going to miss you."
[1:25:51] I said, "Pastor, I will go and meet you
[1:25:55] in the convention."
[1:25:56] Then he said, "Go and come back again.
[1:26:01] We must continue preaching this gospel."
[1:26:05] He was cooking me. I'm well cooked. I
[1:26:09] will continue with the legacy of the
[1:26:12] pastor, irrespective
[1:26:15] of the critics.
[1:26:18] God bless you.
[1:26:20] God bless. Amen.
[1:26:25] All right.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; A round of applause for him.

[1:36:56] I asked myself, why am I chosen to speak
[1:36:59] here?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; They realized that the family realized
[1:37:05] that the pastor loved me.
[1:37:08] He [music] loved the entire church.
[1:37:11] I don't speak long.
[1:37:15] I am good when it comes to listening.
[1:37:22] I'll just talk and when did we meet with
[1:37:24] the pastor
[1:37:27] by my own experience
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; ministry of the seven
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; under this ministry of the seven sin
[1:37:37] the pastor I met the pastor in Kylie
[1:37:43] Cambridge he was invited by pastor
[1:37:45] Monagali and pastor Cambridge
[1:37:49] At that time I didn't really realize
[1:37:52] anything.
[1:37:54] I was only knowing the scripture. That's
[1:37:56] it.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; The pastor spoke about locos.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He spoke about the theophony.
[1:38:05] It was a continuation.
[1:38:08] That thing did something within me.
[1:38:14] Those are the same experiences that has
[1:38:16] kept me to be with him until this far.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; 2013 or 2012.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; In 2013 or 2012,
[1:38:23] False College,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; he was invited by Pastor Khana in False
[1:38:27] College.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He spoke about the revelation of the
[1:38:33] seven sea.
[1:38:36] What is the ministry of the seven se?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; There was a question that he asked. He
[1:38:40] asked, "What is the ministry of the
[1:38:41] seven se?
[1:38:44] That thing didn't give me rest in my
[1:38:46] life.
[1:38:50] It changed me to be with him here, right
[1:38:52] here.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; He gave us life.
[1:38:57] It didn't end there.
[1:39:02] He gave me order in my life.
[1:39:05] I don't want to talk about someone else.
[1:39:10] This thing was a thirst in my soul.
[1:39:14] That order came into the church.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; The pastor loved us so much in Cape
[1:39:20] Town.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; He continued
[1:39:25] and he spoke about meek.
[1:39:31] He will continue with the same series
[1:39:32] for the entire year
[1:39:36] until you realize who you are and where
[1:39:38] are you going?
[1:39:41] There's a preaching that I love from the
[1:39:43] pastor,
[1:39:46] have you met this?
[1:39:51] He doesn't stop there. He says, have you
[1:39:53] met him?
[1:39:56] It shows that you'll never leave here
[1:39:58] same as you are if you have met him.
[1:40:03] You'll never hate anyone once you met
[1:40:07] that is the last 2024
[1:40:12] conference
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; conference
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; that's an experience that I have
[1:40:20] we are grateful so much for the pastor
[1:40:22] at the end
[1:40:25] stone
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; he came with a white stone
[1:40:28] stone
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; yeah the white stone tender around.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; The white stone is rolling.
[1:40:36] Where is it rolling?
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Inside

[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; because that cloud
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; is in us
[1:40:48] in us.
[1:40:53] You wish everyone can milk that.
[1:40:57] Then the lastly the pastor finished by
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; the great pyramid
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; that is the seven se

[1:41:49] is brother Neville Luana.

[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. uh when I was informed
[1:42:26] to [music] come and speak tonight,
[1:42:31] I thought of writing a speech
[1:42:35] speech. But I realized
[1:42:39] how many pages I'm going to write
[1:42:43] or how many books am I going to write?
[1:42:47] Because
[1:42:48] speaking about pastor
[1:42:53] You will not stop.
[1:42:56] Visiting him
[1:42:59] will not be enough.
[1:43:03] When when I come to his house,
[1:43:08] telling him that pastor, we are still
[1:43:10] graced.
[1:43:14] He would remind me
[1:43:16] to relax.
[1:43:22] I remember there's a message that he
[1:43:23] once preached in 1992 [music]
[1:43:26] 1992
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; the 28th of February
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; 28th of February relax.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; The title says relax. If you listen to
[1:43:34] that message
[1:43:37] and listen to the latest message that he
[1:43:40] preached,
[1:43:43] you will see something.
[1:43:45] Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; So, I'm standing here
[1:43:51] relaxed. Being relaxed,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; it can be a bit painful.
[1:43:58] But what I know
[1:44:00] is that my pastor,
[1:44:03] our pastor,
[1:44:06] our grandfather,
[1:44:08] our father,
[1:44:10] our uncle,
[1:44:13] our everything.
[1:44:16] He's in a better place
[1:44:20] and that
[1:44:22] makes me to relax.
[1:44:24] Amen. Amen. So,
[1:44:29] from
[1:44:31] there's many places
[1:44:34] that I know pastor like to travel
[1:44:38] and when we travel those places
[1:44:42] we will just resemble
[1:44:46] because we knew
[1:44:49] what is in his heart
[1:44:52] to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:57] We knew
[1:45:00] when we go to the convention if
[1:45:04] you want to be scolded by the pastor.
[1:45:10] Don't say you did not come with the
[1:45:11] other saint because he did not have
[1:45:13] money.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; You will get a sham.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You will be scolded.
[1:45:17] He is a person
[1:45:20] that will do things from the heart.
[1:45:24] And when it comes out,
[1:45:27] you will see the resemblance.
[1:45:30] So
[1:45:33] I will not stop and I will not finish.
[1:45:37] And as I've said
[1:45:40] from
[1:45:44] we are sending this message to the
[1:45:47] family,
[1:45:49] to the MOI church,
[1:45:52] to the whole of the world.
[1:45:55] I have a friend of mine from Uganda,
[1:46:00] Pastor Lawrence.
[1:46:02] Pastor Lawrence Mango. After he have
[1:46:04] seen the message,
[1:46:07] that our pastor is in glory.
[1:46:12] He sent me a voice note voice note
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; and said, "My brother,
[1:46:18] I was waiting
[1:46:21] to listen to the last part
[1:46:27] of the white stone.
[1:46:29] But God saw it enough
[1:46:33] and he [music] took our elder
[1:46:36] and by so saying
[1:46:38] tell the children of God
[1:46:41] they must [music] forge forward.
[1:46:43] May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:50] Hey doing very well with time.
[1:46:59] Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord
[1:47:22] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; I greet my pastor this side.
[1:47:29] I also greet the family
[1:47:32] and all the friends
[1:47:34] and the children of God.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:40] Amen.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] 1984.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I knew Pastor Kurima since 1984.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Pastor 1984.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; In 1984, Pastor Kurima commissioned
[1:47:55] Elders Kosana. Elder
[1:48:02] and others
[1:48:04] jungles of northwest
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; to come to the jungles of northwest
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the jungles
[1:48:13] of the hour. They brought the message
[1:48:21] of [music]
[1:48:22] I remember when he started preaching in
[1:48:24] the jungles of
[1:48:30] preaching [music] so slow.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; I was surprised. It was my first time to
[1:48:33] hear the pastor preach so slowing.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But after that
[1:48:41] preacher that day but after After having
[1:48:44] listened to the message that he preached
[1:48:45] that day,
[1:48:50] after he left, we we remain focusing his
[1:48:52] message.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; After
[1:48:56] the whole church,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; the whole church was baptized.
[1:49:02] We went to river and we were all
[1:49:04] baptized. And then
[1:49:09] it was not only
[1:49:13] the message of the hour in northwest
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; went to.
[1:49:23] So this is a coronation
[1:49:27] because we believe he fought a good
[1:49:28] fight.
[1:49:30] He kept the faith and he finished the
[1:49:33] course.
[1:49:35] Now we that are here now
[1:49:40] to the family and the church.
[1:49:43] I don't think that no anybody will fit
[1:49:47] in his shoes.
[1:49:51] It is too big.
[1:49:54] But what the pastor will want.
[1:49:58] It is somebody who wear his own shoes
[1:50:03] but will serve the Lord faithfully.
[1:50:08] So whoever that will be serving on his
[1:50:12] death
[1:50:15] just be faithful
[1:50:19] with the same kind of spirit
[1:50:22] loving the people
[1:50:24] and serving the Lord.
[1:50:27] We say farewell to the warario.
[1:50:32] May soul rest in peace.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:38] Amen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I greet the the the bride of the lamb.
[1:50:49] I greet pastor's family.
[1:50:54] Greeting all the pastors.
[1:50:57] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:01] because Jan spoken already. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:17] We thank the Lord because the message
[1:51:18] they reached us in through this and
[1:51:22] after this it was it [music] came to us
[1:51:24] through pastor
[1:51:28] the way that he would preach.
[1:51:37] Oh the sound of the trumpets
[1:51:47] Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] [snorts]
[1:51:55] Amen. God bless.
[1:51:57] A round of applause for the pastor.
[1:52:00] Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; All right. I said the man that is going
[1:52:07] to speak [music]
[1:52:10] walked with the pastor for many many
[1:52:12] years
[1:52:15] and I think he worked it closely with
[1:52:18] him
[1:52:20] and would know him much better than many
[1:52:23] of us
[1:52:27] outside the family.
[1:52:30] Who did his kosana?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] [music]
[1:52:48] Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Uh, I would like to greet you all in the
[1:53:14] precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:53:24] Uh, you will pardon me. Uh my voice I
[1:53:28] had
[1:53:29] flu since Monday I had a flu.
[1:53:35] So my voice is not okay.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; But I would like to
[1:53:41] thank uh the family
[1:53:45] for giving me a chance to say something
[1:53:49] about the pastor.
[1:53:52] And I also like to thank the pastors
[1:53:57] and the church at large.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is true.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; I met the pastor.
[1:54:09] I I I repented in 1977.
[1:54:15] 1977.
[1:54:18] Then I was baptized
[1:54:21] by the deacons.
[1:54:25] Then they handed me over to the pastor
[1:54:30] to mentor me.
[1:54:34] So myself I was a sharpshooter.
[1:54:40] Uh I will ask lot of questions.
[1:54:45] So I said pastor
[1:54:48] Where can I meet God?
[1:54:51] Where can I meet God?
[1:54:55] And the pastor said, "No, you've already
[1:54:57] met God."
[1:55:00] I said, "No, I want to see the man
[1:55:02] himself."
[1:55:06] Then he said, "Have you got spoken
[1:55:08] words?"
[1:55:12] I said, "Yes, I've got three of them."
[1:55:15] What? And they said, "What what are the
[1:55:17] titles?"
[1:55:21] I said, "The first spoken word that they
[1:55:23] gave me was the stature of a perfect
[1:55:26] man,
[1:55:29] the perfect man."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; And the other one was uh demonology
[1:55:36] and the third one was five
[1:55:38] identification of the true church of
[1:55:40] God.
[1:55:44] So I read them all.
[1:55:47] But when I was reading them,
[1:55:50] I was reading them like I read a novel
[1:55:54] of James Hardley Chase.
[1:55:59] You start it in the morning
[1:56:03] uh on your way to work.
[1:56:08] By the time you come back, you're
[1:56:09] through with that one.
[1:56:12] Then you throw it away.
[1:56:14] Then you said, "No, that's not the right
[1:56:16] way to read."
[1:56:19] The first thing that you need to do,
[1:56:24] you need to identify
[1:56:30] the dispensations
[1:56:34] and then followed the ministry itself.
[1:56:40] And then the ministry has got a doctrine
[1:56:45] and that doctrine has got a faith.
[1:56:48] That faith has got an anointing.
[1:56:52] So if you read like that,
[1:56:55] then you've got a center of departure.
[1:56:59] You don't just read a spoken word like
[1:57:01] you are reading a novel.
[1:57:06] So that's how he mentored me.
[1:57:10] So uh I repented in 1977
[1:57:16] as I said
[1:57:19] and then I hear I'm I'm subject to
[1:57:22] correction. I think they started in the
[1:57:25] message around 1977
[1:57:28] somewhere there72
[1:57:32] but they were very few.
[1:57:36] So what happened is that now
[1:57:43] he decided to go with me wherever he
[1:57:45] goes.
[1:57:49] We we were not only to with some other
[1:57:51] elders.
[1:57:54] So we the first place that we went to
[1:57:59] was
[1:58:02] and then
[1:58:06] Switzerland
[1:58:08] then we went around even up to
[1:58:13] so we ended up in
[1:58:18] so now the pastor
[1:58:22] was not a dictator
[1:58:28] The pastor will never stand behind the
[1:58:30] pullpit
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; and harass us. He never.
[1:58:37] Amen.
[1:58:40] And uh
[1:58:42] he watches you.
[1:58:44] If you become rough
[1:58:49] then he politely remove you from the
[1:58:53] And then he will stand behind the pull
[1:58:55] pit and said, "Have you ever
[1:58:59] have you ever
[1:59:01] hear me harassing you
[1:59:04] because you are the souls that comes
[1:59:07] from God?"
[1:59:11] Then he was very very respectful.
[1:59:17] He will never say to me,
[1:59:21] he always says
[1:59:24] to every man.
[1:59:26] You will never call him by the name.
[1:59:30] There's a suffix always.
[1:59:38] That's how he was.
[1:59:42] As brother Mikabi has said here,
[1:59:46] the pastor has taught us a lot of
[1:59:48] things.
[1:59:50] He had a number of sister churches
[1:59:56] and then he used to go and preach during
[1:59:58] the week
[2:00:01] because there are many
[2:00:03] and we couldn't find a deacon there.
[2:00:06] We couldn't find a deacon.
[2:00:10] So he'll dedicate the the the preachers
[2:00:14] to go around and preach.
[2:00:18] He was not selfish about the pullpit.
[2:00:20] [music]
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; But he will never put a man
[2:00:26] behind the pullpit
[2:00:28] who will talk whatever you want to say.
[2:00:32] He will check [music] you
[2:00:34] and check the spirit that is in you.
[2:00:38] And then when
[2:00:40] he talks to you, he will never harass
[2:00:43] you,
[2:00:45] call you very politely
[2:00:47] and sit down with you. And he will take
[2:00:50] time to to to bring his point.
[2:00:56] At times he could say, "Go and speak to
[2:00:58] so and so."
[2:01:01] And then when you go and you would go,
[2:01:04] you speak a little bit rough.
[2:01:09] I'm going to send another one say go and
[2:01:12] speak to that tell him I didn't say he
[2:01:15] must go and harrise
[2:01:18] go and repent there
[2:01:21] that's how it is he loved us all
[2:01:27] small kids
[2:01:30] youth
[2:01:32] elderly people
[2:01:35] everybody body and he was soft
[2:01:39] and the man in which was talking
[2:01:43] he was like a terrestrial rain
[2:01:47] very soft
[2:01:50] but his words
[2:01:52] will find a target
[2:01:55] that's that's how I know him
[2:01:59] now in the physically
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; you might uh uh we might think that is a
[2:02:08] weak person
[2:02:11] but he's very very strong.
[2:02:14] Now supernaturally
[2:02:17] there's some things that were happening
[2:02:21] of which we also could not interpret.
[2:02:26] And when we try to testify about them
[2:02:31] we appear as liars.
[2:02:35] There were hooligans that came to his
[2:02:37] house.
[2:02:42] They
[2:02:43] bind him
[2:02:46] with with h
[2:02:48] cable ties
[2:02:50] ties
[2:02:52] and then there came a fire
[2:02:57] that broke those cable ties.
[2:03:02] There was a time where they were trying
[2:03:04] to strangle him.
[2:03:08] These guys that was trying to strangle
[2:03:10] him,
[2:03:12] their hands
[2:03:14] and elbows
[2:03:16] jammed.
[2:03:20] Then they took him.
[2:03:23] They let him kneel on the sofa and close
[2:03:26] him and put a blanket
[2:03:32] But he was seeing them.
[2:03:36] Who's that? Who's that? Who's that?
[2:03:40] That is say some other testimonies
[2:03:44] might sound as an exaggeration.
[2:03:49] One day
[2:03:52] he was praying for a certain sister
[2:03:55] from uh
[2:03:59] Porschia. Porsche maybe
[2:04:04] Porsha's hair were [music]
[2:04:06] what do you what do you call it? The
[2:04:09] hair was reming
[2:04:11] down.
[2:04:14] So the pastor put the hand on top of
[2:04:20] Kizer is there as my witness
[2:04:23] the hair
[2:04:25] started growing
[2:04:29] and he himself
[2:04:32] would say I don't know I just put a hand
[2:04:36] and those hairs started growing
[2:04:40] so yeah there's quite a lot there's lot
[2:04:42] of testimony
[2:04:45] but the greatest part of it was that
[2:04:49] He was uh in closing, pastor,
[2:04:53] he he had an understanding
[2:04:58] of what he would say.
[2:05:02] He will never say something
[2:05:04] unless he understand what he's talking
[2:05:06] about.
[2:05:09] When we repented,
[2:05:12] there was a commotion. You know, in the
[2:05:14] message there's always a doctrinal
[2:05:16] commotion. Yes.
[2:05:21] These believe that these
[2:05:25] so a bishop here bishop
[2:05:30] he came along
[2:05:32] there were the thunder group there were
[2:05:35] certain young people.
[2:05:42] Yeah.
[2:05:44] So bishop said
[2:05:48] what are these standards? [music]
[2:05:52] Then the pastor said go and ask them.
[2:05:55] Then he went said what are these
[2:05:58] standards?
[2:06:00] They said no you're behind time.
[2:06:04] No you are behind [music] time.
[2:06:07] You don't know what thunders are.
[2:06:10] We want what was uttered by the
[2:06:12] thunders.
[2:06:16] So now he was very very careful
[2:06:20] in in in in in in uttering some other
[2:06:23] instances.
[2:06:26] Yes. Because of time
[2:06:29] I will stop here but
[2:06:33] you know in football
[2:06:35] we say there's a a a captain of
[2:06:38] captains.
[2:06:43] Right. Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; So now the pastor
[2:06:47] I always used to call him
[2:06:50] if there's a captain of captains
[2:06:55] uh to me.
[2:06:58] He was an elder of elders.
[2:07:04] He he used to call the ministry. He used
[2:07:08] to call the ministry
[2:07:11] The ministry he called it
[2:07:14] the sheep of Zion.
[2:07:18] Say this ministry is the ship of Zion.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; The captain of that ministry
[2:07:27] knows every root in the sea.
[2:07:31] He knows even the sizes of the waves.
[2:07:36] will never go and ram it on an iron bag.
[2:07:40] Ice bag
[2:07:45] will cruise. He will cruise.
[2:07:48] That is the ship of Zion.
[2:07:50] Nobody
[2:07:52] can stand before that ship. That's what
[2:07:55] he used to say. May the Lord bless you.
[2:07:59] Bless you. [music]
[2:08:04] Amen.
[2:08:06] All right,
[2:08:10] brother Timothy is in the house.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; From Switzerland.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Sweiland.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[2:08:27] I'm just going to swap things around
[2:08:30] here
[2:08:33] and then we
[2:08:35] let me do this
[2:08:39] because there's a pressure of time
[2:08:44] pastor
[2:08:45] from Zimbabwe. Pastor Godwin
[2:08:50] from Zimbabwe.
[2:08:51] You'll say some few words.
[2:08:54] God bless you.
[2:09:00] [applause]
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Just want to greet you all in the name
[2:09:13] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:09:18] Uh what brings me here
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; is because I believe in this message.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; I know people that would come touch
[2:09:30] something
[2:09:31] fire then the next thing there's
[2:09:33] nothing.
[2:09:36] But brother
[2:09:39] from the first time I met him,
[2:09:43] it was in 1979
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; when we we went to a con a convention in
[2:09:49] Cape Town
[2:09:52] but passing through Mame Loi
[2:09:55] passing through
[2:09:58] uh whenever we came from Harari to South
[2:10:00] Africa
[2:10:03] would go to the mafiris.
[2:10:05] It is it was like our home.
[2:10:08] You always welcomed us
[2:10:13] and we really went on with the ministry
[2:10:16] the ministry of this message
[2:10:19] and we have been seeing them growing
[2:10:24] as quiet as so spoken as he is.
[2:10:29] he would have time to go to Switzerland,
[2:10:33] do something there, come back here. When
[2:10:37] he came to Malawi, he always came and
[2:10:40] slept by our house.
[2:10:43] When he was going there and when he was
[2:10:45] coming back,
[2:10:47] he was always just gent gentle.
[2:10:52] And uh
[2:10:55] what what really worries me now
[2:11:01] Like the Lord Jesus one time said,
[2:11:05] "Simon, Simon,
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; do you love me more than all these?
[2:11:12] Feed my sheep
[2:11:15] and feed my lambs.
[2:11:18] If you love your pastor,
[2:11:20] look after the sheep.
[2:11:23] feed them
[2:11:25] the sheep and the lambs. They need to be
[2:11:29] looked after.
[2:11:33] We don't want to hear that this thing
[2:11:35] has disintegrated
[2:11:41] and and some funny man comes from West
[2:11:43] Africa
[2:11:46] with all kinds of nonsense.
[2:11:50] We have been trained by Malachi 4.
[2:11:56] We stand with the word. We believe the
[2:11:58] word.
[2:12:01] And God makes us see the word work in
[2:12:05] our lives.
[2:12:09] So I am very keen to see this church
[2:12:12] even going on further and further and
[2:12:15] higher and higher and deeper and deeper.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; also in the natural
[2:12:29] um brother
[2:12:34] is a relative of mine.
[2:12:38] We belong to the family of Monomapa.
[2:12:45] We are a very very high dynasty.
[2:12:50] But everything comes to an end sometime.
[2:12:56] So we want to make sure that this does
[2:12:59] not become a pepper fire.
[2:13:04] Just put a small fire there and then
[2:13:07] when you look outside there's nothing.
[2:13:09] This thing has been on for a long time.
[2:13:13] And
[2:13:14] the other hidden blessing that I have
[2:13:17] from that church
[2:13:19] is the scos
[2:13:24] they are such a big blessing to us
[2:13:32] and it's a pity that they had also
[2:13:35] become very good friends with one of our
[2:13:38] men that was a lead guitarist.
[2:13:46] He was
[2:13:48] from our church
[2:13:50] that could shake the world with his
[2:13:53] guitar
[2:13:55] because gifts are given to people by go
[2:13:58] by God.
[2:14:01] But uh he's he's been taken home.
[2:14:08] And then uh the day we buried him,
[2:14:12] I made a statement.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; I said in the scriptures
[2:14:18] in the days of David,
[2:14:22] uh David said
[2:14:26] who is there? That is a close relative.
[2:14:34] And they found there was a a son a lamb
[2:14:37] son called meet.
[2:14:42] And David says from now onwards
[2:14:45] you stay in the palace
[2:14:48] you live in the palace eat in the palace
[2:14:52] because of what your father did.
[2:14:57] So even that I said his daughter I said
[2:15:01] the vehicle that we wanted to buy for
[2:15:03] your father we are going to buy it for
[2:15:05] you and it will be yours
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; for as long as you want it.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; In other words we leave some our
[2:15:14] children as well.
[2:15:17] Uh we don't want to be overtaken
[2:15:22] by things that come from West Africa
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; and make people eat snakes
[2:15:31] and things that come from Malawi
[2:15:34] and call themselves bushies.
[2:15:37] Anyway, most people are afraid to attack
[2:15:39] these people. Never been afraid of any
[2:15:42] of them. confronted them and will
[2:15:46] confront them because I know that
[2:15:48] greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:15:51] is in those people.
[2:15:55] We will prevail. We have prevailed.
[2:16:01] So young men, you people that are still
[2:16:04] young,
[2:16:06] get deep in the word.
[2:16:09] Get deep in prayer
[2:16:13] and get to a point
[2:16:15] where you really know
[2:16:18] that you are part of it.
[2:16:20] Don't be afraid
[2:16:23] to take your position.
[2:16:27] We don't want this thing to just crumble
[2:16:29] to nothing.
[2:16:36] If the man that was running with the
[2:16:38] button stick,
[2:16:42] if he has run his course,
[2:16:45] it must land in someone's hand.
[2:16:49] It's up to you people to make sure that
[2:16:51] the man that will be taking that
[2:16:54] position is a man of integrity,
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; a man who knows what he's doing. Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; And a man who loves and believes the
[2:17:02] message.
[2:17:05] And it must be somebody who is not
[2:17:07] afraid to confront
[2:17:10] to confront the devil
[2:17:14] whatever form he comes in.
[2:17:17] He wouldn't want to have worked for
[2:17:19] nothing.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; There's a man from West Africa called
[2:17:23] Kaku trying to come to certain areas to
[2:17:27] try to deceive people.
[2:17:31] No, don't allow anything
[2:17:36] actually to just say if someone comes
[2:17:38] from West Africa
[2:17:40] with a desire to preach and so forth, we
[2:17:42] say please we have enough preachers
[2:17:44] here.
[2:17:48] and keep your West Africa
[2:17:52] and the juju thereof.
[2:17:55] And leave us here
[2:17:58] with our music
[2:18:01] and our way of doing things
[2:18:06] because many many nations are being
[2:18:09] destroyed
[2:18:12] by these things from West Africa. West
[2:18:16] Africa,
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; they know what they are doing.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Anyway, one of the times at least I I
[2:18:25] like brave people.
[2:18:29] One of the things that I like about
[2:18:31] Madiva
[2:18:35] is because he's bold.
[2:18:42] You all know you heard the story.
[2:18:45] They had a man had come to destroy the
[2:18:47] message in South Africa. Yeah.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And he almost did.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; But there came a time
[2:18:57] when it we we begin began to get
[2:19:01] information
[2:19:03] about what the man is doing.
[2:19:08] And I I saw Satan fall like lightning.
[2:19:15] So I have given you
[2:19:18] power to tread
[2:19:21] against serpents
[2:19:24] and all these things.
[2:19:26] Nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[2:19:35] He was shocked.
[2:19:39] That man was shocked and and we drove
[2:19:42] him out of this country.
[2:19:47] And when he got back to his country,
[2:19:50] they made him an archbishop
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; in the Catholic church
[2:19:58] because it destroyed the message here.
[2:20:01] We don't allow anything in the pull pit
[2:20:04] unless we know who it is and where he's
[2:20:06] coming from.
[2:20:12] We don't want to be nice people.
[2:20:16] We want to do what is right. Amen.
[2:20:20] So we are moving on.
[2:20:23] I don't want to hear that this church
[2:20:25] has now scattered this one going there
[2:20:27] there. No.
[2:20:32] Jesus said, "If you love me,
[2:20:36] feed my sheep
[2:20:39] and feed my lambs."
[2:20:43] And we don't want to hear that this
[2:20:45] church is splitting up this one, this
[2:20:47] one. No,
[2:20:50] just work together.
[2:20:53] If you know of a good preacher somewhere
[2:20:57] that can give your sheep more than you
[2:20:59] can give on a certain subject.
[2:21:04] If you take like a man like George
[2:21:05] Martin,
[2:21:07] he just had it. So we loved him because
[2:21:11] he had depths. He had a way of doing
[2:21:14] things and he was always in the
[2:21:17] scriptures.
[2:21:19] And
[2:21:21] when you know people that are talented
[2:21:25] that are talented
[2:21:27] and that mean business,
[2:21:30] work with them.
[2:21:33] Give them the chance
[2:21:36] and uh let them give you the chance as
[2:21:38] well.
[2:21:40] And uh we are doing very very well.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Uh
[2:21:47] I think by the end of the year
[2:21:51] we are going to have a big tent meeting
[2:21:55] in Mozambique.
[2:22:01] We are going to have tent campaigns
[2:22:07] to make sure that this southern region
[2:22:13] we are doing our part
[2:22:18] many of you ministers here
[2:22:21] I want you to understand me.
[2:22:24] We have an obligation.
[2:22:28] Brother Branham came to South Africa.
[2:22:32] The pillar of fire came to South Africa.
[2:22:36] The supernatural was demonstrated in
[2:22:38] South Africa
[2:22:41] and brother Brham so much wanted to come
[2:22:43] to Africa
[2:22:47] and every opportunity that we have
[2:22:51] to make sure that brother Brham's
[2:22:54] message
[2:22:56] that God gave him we have given you to
[2:22:58] the people.
[2:23:00] We have given it to the people.
[2:23:04] I know my brother Miba,
[2:23:07] he likes one of the things I always say.
[2:23:11] We don't want to be cheap Africans.
[2:23:15] Don't be a cheap African
[2:23:19] to go overseas because when the devil is
[2:23:22] blocking away everywhere,
[2:23:25] then it's time to get angry
[2:23:28] with the devil.
[2:23:31] Get angry with the devil.
[2:23:35] Brother Brham says this one time. They
[2:23:39] were at a certain place
[2:23:41] and there was a there was a nice looking
[2:23:44] young lady.
[2:23:48] But she had lost her mind.
[2:23:51] She was just saying all things that are
[2:23:53] can't make out what brother
[2:23:57] he wanted to just know who is this one.
[2:24:00] What's what's going on with this one?
[2:24:01] What's going on? Then someone says this
[2:24:04] is the daughter
[2:24:06] of that very famous man of God.
[2:24:11] Brother Brham said when they said that
[2:24:14] was the daughter of a man that I knew to
[2:24:16] be a man of God. He said he said
[2:24:19] something came upon me. He said
[2:24:22] something came upon me.
[2:24:25] And within a short time that devil was
[2:24:28] driven away.
[2:24:31] In other words, something must come upon
[2:24:33] you. When you see the work you have
[2:24:36] worked for all these years. Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; All these years. When you see now
[2:24:42] something someone splitting, going this
[2:24:44] way, someone this way. The time you're
[2:24:46] going to confront someone say, "Brother,
[2:24:50] you don't want to build on someone's
[2:24:52] reputation. If you really believe in
[2:24:54] your ministry, go start somewhere.
[2:24:59] Not start taking sheep.
[2:25:02] Come over here. I'll make you a table.
[2:25:04] Ah, no. No. We don't want that. We want
[2:25:08] to make sure.
[2:25:10] Do all your best
[2:25:13] and let's keep on going.
[2:25:19] We just had a good we had a good time in
[2:25:22] Zambia.
[2:25:24] They built a wonderful church in Zambia
[2:25:27] and they are doing very well.
[2:25:31] They also went there to dedicate their
[2:25:33] church
[2:25:35] and they are moving on very strong.
[2:25:38] We don't want the region to suffer.
[2:25:42] When we say the region all wherever we
[2:25:45] are
[2:25:47] message
[2:25:48] we don't want to have things falling
[2:25:51] apart.
[2:25:53] The ministers
[2:25:56] be kind to one another.
[2:26:01] be nice to one another
[2:26:05] and then make sure the church goes on.
[2:26:11] Even if the church becomes a little bit
[2:26:13] too big,
[2:26:16] it's not a problem,
[2:26:19] you will still have enough time
[2:26:22] for that church.
[2:26:24] This church
[2:26:27] for all I know
[2:26:29] in South Africa
[2:26:32] is purely black church is this one
[2:26:36] church the black church
[2:26:39] this one
[2:26:41] if there are any others I know not where
[2:26:43] they are
[2:26:49] where they are
[2:26:52] but this one I've always known them
[2:26:56] coming the mafiris and all and
[2:27:00] my friends we come a long way and
[2:27:03] whenever we came here
[2:27:06] we always we always accommodated
[2:27:10] and we want you we want to accommodate
[2:27:13] you
[2:27:15] when you come as well
[2:27:17] when we come to singing
[2:27:21] we are not going to as long as we know
[2:27:23] you are going to be singing. We will be
[2:27:25] quiet because it's not our area.
[2:27:30] We don't know what to do with singing
[2:27:33] over here.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; That's just what you have.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh if God gives us grace,
[2:27:42] we will be building a convention center
[2:27:48] that can seat a lot of people.
[2:27:53] And then we can also have places for
[2:27:56] singers.
[2:27:59] The people here you are singers.
[2:28:02] Once in a while we can also make up
[2:28:05] something but uh it's not our gift.
[2:28:08] Amen.
[2:28:12] Even all this time know the drum just
[2:28:15] the drum
[2:28:19] and the singing with nothing else.
[2:28:22] People were getting in the spirit
[2:28:25] because they know that rhythm.
[2:28:29] So we want to assure you, brethren,
[2:28:34] don't let this church be destroyed.
[2:28:42] And if you can make sure that
[2:28:45] you work together,
[2:28:48] you work together
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; to keep on going.
[2:28:53] May God bless you all. I've been
[2:28:56] accompanied.
[2:28:58] I came with my wife
[2:29:01] and my two daughters.
[2:29:04] They are here with us
[2:29:09] [music]
[2:29:12] and uh
[2:29:14] once in a while
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; once in a while we would like to just
[2:29:20] come in see
[2:29:25] Jesus.

[2:41:14] choir,
[2:41:19] he's not here. Yeah. What's the name of
[2:41:23] the song for Cape Town?

[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; it's fine.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; I greet the children of God
[2:41:54] in the holy name of the Lord Jesus
[2:41:56] Christ.
[2:42:03] I would like to thank our pastors
[2:42:06] from far and near.
[2:42:08] Those who came.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; I would also like to thank
[2:42:16] the family of our pastor.
[2:42:26] And the main thing I would like to thank
[2:42:27] Omar
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; to grant me the opportunity.
[2:42:40] I I think you can see that I'm still
[2:42:41] young.
[2:42:54] his first trip to Bo.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; He had nothing.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; He was not driving.
[2:43:09] 1976.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; We started in 1976.
[2:43:17] It was
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; after he found the prophet's books
[2:43:31] from
[2:43:35] the true church of God.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; At that time we were fellowshiing at the
[2:43:38] truth church of God.
[2:43:44] By then, Raesa was on on leave.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; He then read the books
[2:43:54] because we were still young.
[2:44:00] 1920,
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; not that young. We about 1920.
[2:44:04] And then
[2:44:06] brother
[2:44:08] and then brother Getty testified to us
[2:44:12] about the message
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; we were together in the true church.
[2:44:21] But when the prophet's books arrived
[2:44:24] and those small tracks then
[2:44:28] he then said to us
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; this thing
[2:44:35] this matter of this man
[2:44:39] referring to brotherham
[2:44:42] if it's like this
[2:44:46] man from Lord they they have it like is
[2:44:52] he then left us by saying I am going to
[2:44:54] be baptized and then
[2:44:59] the leave was over. He then came back to
[2:45:01] Modi
[2:45:07] at that time. There was there were no
[2:45:08] phones.
[2:45:10] We were using letters.
[2:45:12] He then wrote a letter to us.
[2:45:15] He then asked us as to what are we
[2:45:18] saying.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; We also said we also want to be baptized
[2:45:25] as a group.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; April 76
[2:45:32] in April. He organized that in April of
[2:45:34] 1976
[2:45:38] conference
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; that it be a conference.
[2:45:42] That's where I was baptized.
[2:45:48] I was baptized by Elder Masuka.
[2:45:52] When we were baptized,
[2:45:56] pastor was going around
[2:46:01] out of the water,
[2:46:04] going back into the village.
[2:46:08] our conference.
[2:46:11] We would feit in a in a round in a small
[2:46:14] house.
[2:46:17] That was our conference
[2:46:20] from there.
[2:46:23] They went back. They came with their
[2:46:26] from there.
[2:46:30] Then the pastor,
[2:46:32] he starts a journey
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; to come to Bo.
[2:46:38] At that time he did not have a car.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; He was using a train.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; It will leave Ptoria
[2:46:48] 8 in the in the night.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; It would arrive in
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Petersburg
[2:46:55] 5.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; It was 5 in the morning.
[2:46:57] &gt;&gt; 5 6 5 6 in the morning. And at
[2:47:02] that time he was supposed to stay at the
[2:47:04] station and then
[2:47:08] 7 around 7 he will leave from the
[2:47:10] station
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; he would go to the bus ring
[2:47:18] the the bus to bo
[2:47:22] I'm I'm telling you about the trip
[2:47:26] of a man
[2:47:30] who had a burden in his heart
[2:47:35] so that he could further own the
[2:47:36] children of God.
[2:47:39] 11:00
[2:47:41] the bus will leave around about 11:00
[2:47:43] during the day.
[2:47:48] At that time, brother K wrote us letters
[2:47:51] telling us the pastor is coming.
[2:47:57] The best the bus will depart at 11 from
[2:47:59] Petersburg to where we stay
[2:48:03] and then
[2:48:04] it
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; it doesn't come exactly to our place. It
[2:48:06] will go pass by our place.
[2:48:09] It will arrive around about 3.
[2:48:13] Having boarded the bus at 11,
[2:48:19] it will arrive a place called around
[2:48:21] about 3.
[2:48:24] From there to where we stay,
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; there is no taxi, there's no car,
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; we would walk.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; We would walk through the trees,
[2:48:41] a distance of 5 kilos.
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; It could be about 5 kilometers
[2:48:46] walking.
[2:48:51] At that time you were the ones who were
[2:48:53] supposed to help the pastor
[2:48:56] with his bags
[2:49:00] so that he could walk because we were
[2:49:01] used to it.
[2:49:04] We should arrive while there still time.
[2:49:09] At that time we should have a service
[2:49:15] that old man
[2:49:17] of God he worked
[2:49:26] When he was coming to our place,
[2:49:29] we knew that
[2:49:32] we must go welcome him.
[2:49:37] The following day he would go on. He
[2:49:38] born he would born in a bus again
[2:49:46] and then from there he would then come
[2:49:47] to
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; until
[2:49:52] there was a formation of a church or
[2:49:54] congregation.
[2:49:56] He then ordained a pastor.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; He then retired and come back to work.
[2:50:10] We then pastor then ordained
[2:50:15] and then and then the church grew from
[2:50:27] and then
[2:50:31] comes from. So
[2:50:37] mama is the one who requested me at
[2:50:40] least
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; so that people know that when they speak
[2:50:46] about pastor
[2:50:48] today
[2:50:50] they know him.
[2:50:53] They see him driving a car.
[2:50:57] They should know that he comes from far.
[2:51:01] He walked using with his own feet.
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that in this time there
[2:51:11] could be a pastor could take that kind
[2:51:12] of a chance.
[2:51:19] And many of us in this part
[2:51:25] on that group that we were baptized
[2:51:26] together,
[2:51:28] many of them
[2:51:31] as the message progressed,
[2:51:37] we started seeing some true colors
[2:51:41] because they start by saying
[2:51:46] They say you guys meaning like referring
[2:51:48] to me,
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; you worship a man,
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; you follow a man,
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; but that which was in my heart
[2:52:04] and that what I was seeing,
[2:52:10] &gt;&gt; this man lived the message preach a
[2:52:14] message. He preached the message
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; the one that he leaves
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; but us especially
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; especially myself because
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; because I believe that among that group
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; from 1976
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; from 1976
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; you can count as to how how many years
[2:52:35] 49 years
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; it's about for 9 years
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; next year April
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; next year April 50 years
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; it will be 50 years
[2:52:44] I'm I'm the only one who remained in
[2:52:47] that group
[2:52:50] when Elder Elder G was coming.
[2:52:53] So today
[2:52:58] we thank the Lord because
[2:53:03] I remember when we're now this time this
[2:53:05] side of
[2:53:09] saying to Elders
[2:53:12] I say elder I am growing old
[2:53:16] I'm going back home
[2:53:18] at that
[2:53:25] There was already some divisions
[2:53:29] because the pastor
[2:53:31] they no longer wanted him that side
[2:53:34] myself.
[2:53:36] I believed his ministry.
[2:53:40] I was saying this to elders kosana.
[2:53:44] I said, "What then are we going to do?"
[2:53:47] Because I'm going back home.
[2:53:50] Where are we going to fellowship?
[2:53:54] And said, "Don't worry.
[2:53:56] We will arrange
[2:54:00] especially myself. I thought that
[2:54:05] if would find a place,
[2:54:10] it won't be a problem for me to leave.
[2:54:16] God blessed us again
[2:54:22] and then branch back at home in Bo.
[2:54:26] Children of God,
[2:54:29] we are speaking about a man
[2:54:33] who sacrificed his life
[2:54:41] because
[2:54:45] 76.
[2:54:49] Yes. [music]
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; Imagine the years that he preached, the
[2:54:54] years that went over 50 years.
[2:54:59] Subtract the 50 years from his years
[2:55:02] that he lived,
[2:55:04] you'll see that his entire life
[2:55:07] he lived in the Lord.
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Even today,
[2:55:12] As I'm speaking to you,
[2:55:18] I am following what the pastor taught
[2:55:20] me.
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; Next year, April, February,
[2:55:24] next year, February,
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; next next year in February, 70 years,
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; I will be 70 years old.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; And then
[2:55:32] I want you to to from 1976
[2:55:35] &gt;&gt; from 1976
[2:55:39] when I will be doing
[2:55:42] You will see that my life
[2:55:47] I lived under the grace of God
[2:55:51] because of the man who showed me
[2:55:55] I am not a preacher.
[2:55:57] I'm a follower.
[2:56:01] That old man taught me that
[2:56:06] when people work in the field,
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; when they would be working the field,
[2:56:11] [music]
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; when someone comes,
[2:56:18] finding you working,
[2:56:22] he will then leave you, take at the home
[2:56:25] and
[2:56:40] I am thankful.
[2:58:01] life on the other side
[2:58:03] is better than the life this
[2:58:06] I am thankful
[2:58:10] standing here on [clears throat] behalf
[2:58:12] of friends
[2:58:14] uh
[2:58:17] You will forgive me. I'm not going to be
[2:58:18] long.
[2:58:21] I had a lot of things to talk to to
[2:58:23] speak about our brother. Our pastor
[2:58:27] [clears throat]
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; when I I I I first know my pastor
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; 1967.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; It was in 1967
[2:58:40] Assemblies of God.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; That's when I arrived at Assemblies of
[2:58:43] God.
[2:58:47] As the pastor was talking about pastor
[2:58:49] Benu, pastor Ben was our pastor.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; We were together with
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; we were all at assemblies of God.
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:59:14] Sister,
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; you did not think it would be like this
[2:59:22] when these things started.
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; You did not believe
[2:59:33] just briefly.
[2:59:45] When I first met the pastor, he was with
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; and two and then
[3:00:00] brother and brother.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; The late brother.
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; The late brother.
[3:00:08] and the late
[3:00:13] as the pastor as pastor said
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; about my family it was our center
[3:00:22] we would gather there
[3:00:25] but before I could receive the message
[3:00:30] he left me and went for another church
[3:00:36] that's where he got the books of the
[3:00:38] message
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; because we were friend assemblies of
[3:00:41] God.
[3:00:41] &gt;&gt; Because we were friends and assemblies
[3:00:43] of God,
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; we were living like families.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; I knew his family. He knew my family.
[3:00:55] After he after he received the message,
[3:00:59] he then remembered me.
[3:01:04] He came to me.
[3:01:06] He brought the books.
[3:01:09] He He even borrowed me a tape.
[3:01:15] At that time, we knew that we had the
[3:01:17] gospel.
[3:01:22] We knew that God says sins are forgiven.
[3:01:30] them. They would carry backs with the
[3:01:32] spoken word in it.
[3:01:35] Then I thought to myself, these men are
[3:01:37] suffering.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God,
[3:01:41] but they told me about the prophet,
[3:01:46] I saw to him, my brother Luke.
[3:01:52] It's true. This man went through or he
[3:01:55] has played his role.
[3:01:58] But it's our it's time that we also run
[3:02:02] our our race.
[3:02:09] &gt;&gt; But it was true in short
[3:02:14] message.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; The day I received the message,
[3:02:20] God made that we there be commotion at
[3:02:22] church
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; in the assemblies assemblies of God.
[3:02:25] Then I started to read the spoken word
[3:02:29] spoken word. I started to read God's
[3:02:31] chosen place of worship. Amen.
[3:02:37] It's the one that God opened my eyes
[3:02:40] with
[3:02:48] the main thing that I came here to say
[3:02:49] briefly
[3:02:55] unusual God
[3:03:01] who operate in unusual ways.
[3:03:10] He was very shy.
[3:03:13] He was shy.
[3:03:17] In these
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; we would form a group and sing in the
[3:03:20] assemblies of God
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; and then he knew how to play guitar.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; He was the one play guitar for us.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; But for him to play that guitar.
[3:03:35] They should put a chair for him so he
[3:03:37] could hide when playing the guitar.
[3:03:40] He wouldn't stand up.
[3:03:43] We will stand up and sing.
[3:03:50] The reason I say God works in mysterious
[3:03:52] ways, nobody will believe
[3:03:57] one day he will be a pastor.
[3:04:07] as a street preacher
[3:04:10] &gt;&gt; in trains wherever
[3:04:14] I am I will stand in the street
[3:04:17] but he wouldn't do that
[3:04:22] message
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; but after he has received the message
[3:04:30] then I would ask who's preaching they
[3:04:31] would say
[3:04:35] until
[3:04:38] until I receive the message and go there
[3:04:41] because there's one thing
[3:04:47] we we we we live together. We working
[3:04:49] together.
[3:04:52] If you know, he was working at church
[3:04:54] square
[3:04:57] and church.
[3:04:58] &gt;&gt; I was working at Andre and church.
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; We we would be together during lunch
[3:05:05] time.
[3:05:06] &gt;&gt; Even when we knock off, we would be
[3:05:08] together.
[3:05:10] It was someone that I know very well. I
[3:05:12] remember one day. I I remember one day I
[3:05:15] said to him,
[3:05:18] "Tell me, how are you going to get
[3:05:19] married?"
[3:05:21] Because
[3:05:23] because he was shy.
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:28] &gt;&gt; But God makes wonders
[3:05:31] when I was with him.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; He would take [music] me and place me a
[3:05:36] pastor
[3:05:39] because of how I was preaching at the
[3:05:41] streets.
[3:05:45] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that when you preach
[3:05:47] at the streets,
[3:05:49] &gt;&gt; you've got a gift of being a pastor.
[3:05:51] Hallelujah.
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:59] After I received the message,
[3:06:02] Hallelujah.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:07] My wife remained there.
[3:06:10] You know what they said?
[3:06:17] a special river.
[3:06:20] They said when we in the mer they said
[3:06:22] those people they've got a special river
[3:06:23] where they
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; they worship brenam.
[3:06:36] Then she she realized she was surprised
[3:06:38] when we went to to baptize we use the
[3:06:40] same river at the fabric. Here's
[3:06:45] one last thing.
[3:06:51] &gt;&gt; The time we received the message,
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; we would always go to brother's church
[3:06:58] for for conferences to conferences.
[3:07:02] Yes. During Easter, during festival
[3:07:04] seasons, one day
[3:07:09] he came to us and said,
[3:07:17] That's what that was when brother Mat
[3:07:18] was on the other side where there was
[3:07:21] people who believed the message
[3:07:27] he said let's go to and have our
[3:07:29] conference there
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; the reason why
[3:07:35] if we bring these people here's
[3:07:38] church
[3:07:41] They would preach in English, interpret
[3:07:43] in Africans.
[3:07:47] When you bring old bed women, they will
[3:07:49] not hear anything.
[3:07:52] That's when we started the way to.
[3:07:57] That's how the work started.
[3:08:01] From
[3:08:04] there, it went further on
[3:08:09] through the man God used
[3:08:13] through pastor.
[3:08:16] I thank God because I don't know now is
[3:08:20] how many pastors us back
[3:08:24] because
[3:08:28] of how God used him.
[3:08:33] That's why I'm saying God operates in
[3:08:35] unusual ways
[3:08:39] just spoke something that is very
[3:08:40] crucial.
[3:08:44] During that time had no car.
[3:08:51] We would travel by railway buses.
[3:09:00] Everybody would board in that bus.
[3:09:01] People would drink in those buses.
[3:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he will tolerate going towards
[3:09:09] Petersburg
[3:09:12] when we sometimes would go to
[3:09:13] Switzerland.
[3:09:16] You remember
[3:09:19] in the passage,
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; brother Gab was still reminding that you
[3:09:22] remember that we would passage five
[3:09:24] brothers.
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; Four or five brothers.
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; We thank
[3:09:32] May God bless her. By the time
[3:09:38] they were they used to stay in the flat
[3:09:39] before they
[3:09:42] before they could build their own house
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; we would all
[3:09:48] in the flat she would
[3:09:51] sleep together with his children
[3:09:54] with pastor. Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:10:00] Who can
[3:10:02] a church
[3:10:04] traveling by bus sleeping on the floor?
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; He worked. May God bless you.
[3:10:12] God bless you.
[3:10:15] Amen. I will call [music] Cape Town not
[3:10:18] now but I will give them an indication.
[3:10:21] Pastor Salm as you come my pastor.
[3:10:29] [music]
[3:10:36] God bless you.
[3:10:40] Much much have been said about pastor.
[3:10:45] I don't have many things to say about
[3:10:48] him.
[3:10:50] I just wanted to tell you a story
[3:10:55] and u how we met
[3:10:59] and uh how we fell in love each other.
[3:11:04] Yes. Because for me it's a a story love.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know that.
[3:11:13] I think I'm the first lover of Pastor
[3:11:17] Kima in this building.
[3:11:21] I love Pastor Kurima
[3:11:24] better than anyone here.
[3:11:31] So I I I I met him.
[3:11:36] I met him in 2009. 2009
[3:11:39] &gt;&gt; I was invited in a conference at a
[3:11:43] tabernacle
[3:11:46] pastor Zakola.
[3:11:48] &gt;&gt; It was in 2009 2009
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; and I was in that conference
[3:11:54] and I saw an old man
[3:11:59] preaching [music] very mysterious
[3:12:02] things.
[3:12:05] seven seals.
[3:12:11] Oh, I say, "Who is that man?"
[3:12:14] Because at that time,
[3:12:17] I thought I was the only one preaching
[3:12:19] those things.
[3:12:23] Then I found someone, an old man,
[3:12:28] preaching very deep things,
[3:12:32] even better than me.
[3:12:35] I say, "Oh, this man,
[3:12:38] I must stick with him."
[3:12:41] So just after the service I I run to him
[3:12:46] and I I I got his contact
[3:12:49] and he was with brother Mete
[3:12:53] &gt;&gt; and few months after
[3:12:57] I invited him to DRC
[3:13:01] because I'm the first one who invited
[3:13:03] Pastor Kod and DRC.
[3:13:07] Yeah. So now you can understand why he
[3:13:12] called me his first son.
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; Pastor Kodima is not my pastor. He's my
[3:13:20] father.
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's my father. Amen.
[3:13:25] And uh I'm the first one
[3:13:29] and Pastor Freddy is the second one.
[3:13:35] And that's all.
[3:13:37] [laughter]
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; No, everywhere. [laughter] Everywhere.
[3:13:44] Everywhere.
[3:13:46] So when we invited
[3:13:51] at that time we were just a small church
[3:13:55] and when they came [music]
[3:13:58] he didn't come himself.
[3:14:01] He came with sisters and
[3:14:05] We didn't have money.
[3:14:08] How can you accommodate all those?
[3:14:11] And and we arranged something for the
[3:14:14] sisters.
[3:14:16] And uh I asked them to be accommodated
[3:14:18] in hotel.
[3:14:21] And they say no. I said okay. So what's
[3:14:24] now?
[3:14:26] And the sister said, "We sleep here."
[3:14:30] I say, "Where?" In the living room.
[3:14:34] Hey. I say, "Who are those men?
[3:14:37] Where's those sisters? Where they are
[3:14:40] coming from?" And they were there the
[3:14:43] whole night singing in the living room,
[3:14:49] singing with my kids.
[3:14:51] And they brought sweet for my kids and
[3:14:54] for
[3:14:57] And I found them very special people.
[3:15:01] They were very special brothers and
[3:15:04] sisters. They were very special.
[3:15:07] And the pastor was very humble.
[3:15:11] He didn't ask me anything.
[3:15:14] So anything that I he wanted, he was
[3:15:16] sweet potatoes.
[3:15:20] And he asked my wife to to cook some
[3:15:23] sweet potatoes for him.
[3:15:26] He liked those sweet potatoes
[3:15:29] because you know the sweet potatoes in
[3:15:31] Kong are not like yours here.
[3:15:35] Yours here is not good.
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't have sweet potatoes.
[3:15:41] Come to come when you eat sweet
[3:15:43] potatoes.
[3:15:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[3:15:46] &gt;&gt; And they want you to eat pondu.
[3:15:52] &gt;&gt; Pondu. You know pondu
[3:15:55] you don't know ponduh pondu pondu is
[3:15:57] cava leaves
[3:16:01] it's so sweeten
[3:16:03] just ask about brother
[3:16:06] so if anyone of you want to eat those
[3:16:08] things just come to cook
[3:16:10] so they brought sweet for me and for my
[3:16:14] kids
[3:16:16] and my wife cooked potatoes for them
[3:16:21] then
[3:16:22] We fell in love
[3:16:25] and that's how it started.
[3:16:28] And then I come to visit Melody
[3:16:32] and I found very nice people.
[3:16:36] Let me tell you, you are the most
[3:16:39] spiritual church in the world.
[3:16:45] Yeah. The the best people I ever met.
[3:16:53] in the message world
[3:16:57] are the members of Mamelo.
[3:17:02] So
[3:17:04] let me let me let me how do you say in
[3:17:08] English?
[3:17:10] Let let me give you flowers.

[3:17:15] &gt;&gt; Oh
[3:17:17] yes flowers. And so you are the product
[3:17:21] of a very strong ministry.
[3:17:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know that
[3:17:30] you have a good character
[3:17:35] which is the result of a very strong and
[3:17:38] good ministry.
[3:17:43] And uh and uh today
[3:17:46] I feel so lonely and sad.
[3:17:52] Yeah. Very sad because my father is not
[3:17:56] here.
[3:17:59] And uh I I'm afraid
[3:18:03] please
[3:18:05] don't lose that character.
[3:18:11] Just keep it. Please
[3:18:16] &gt;&gt; keep it
[3:18:18] keep it. The the the the the preaching
[3:18:20] the sermon
[3:18:23] that Pastor Kima was preaching all of
[3:18:25] these years
[3:18:28] has made you what you are today.
[3:18:33] Best people ever.
[3:18:37] And uh today I just come here to say
[3:18:41] to express my love
[3:18:45] for pastor
[3:18:47] and my love for you all.

[3:19:10] ask the professor
[3:19:17] and then brother Morris from
[3:19:21] Morris
[3:19:22] &gt;&gt; and brother
[3:19:24] from

[3:19:29] minutes.
[3:19:32] Amen. Amen. As they come.
[3:19:36] Amen.
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:19:47] &gt;&gt; Please, brother Carlos, can you come
[3:19:49] over?
[3:19:52] &gt;&gt; No, Carlos.
[3:19:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Carlos, can you come to the
[3:19:55] stage?
[3:20:14] Sorry, I'll not speak in English.
[3:20:20] I will speak in Portuguese
[3:20:23] &gt;&gt; so that I can feel.
[3:20:29] You apologize me.
[3:20:36] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in this evening
[3:20:44] because of this great ceremony which we
[3:20:46] have today.
[3:20:53] We were got in the corner.
[3:21:14] Today we are here to celebrate his life,
[3:21:19] the life of this great man.
[3:21:25] We got many things to say but we are not
[3:21:29] saying much.
[3:21:32] So we just resume it.
[3:21:35] I was given only two minutes.
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; I will try just I will try to use this
[3:21:45] two minutes.
[3:21:50] I don't know if the message will get
[3:21:52] you.
[3:21:55] We came here to say
[3:22:00] that Satan is a liar.
[3:22:06] Because he thinks
[3:22:10] when he take out the messenger
[3:22:16] he think that the ministry will fall
[3:22:19] when the messenger is taken.
[3:22:24] Do we want to say in the the the raised
[3:22:28] voice this evening
[3:22:32] that Satan is a liar?
[3:22:38] &gt;&gt; This ministry
[3:22:41] is not a ministry to fall.
[3:22:45] I can't see the way to make this
[3:22:47] ministry fall.
[3:22:51] &gt;&gt; That ministry of M Lord will fall. I
[3:22:53] don't see the way.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; We want to exalt the brothers from here
[3:23:02] South Africa
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; that you take the character of that man.
[3:23:13] You know when the Lord Jesus was
[3:23:15] crucified,
[3:23:22] some disciple thought that the work was
[3:23:25] over.
[3:23:28] They start to go the other ways
[3:23:33] until Peter who was most trusted.
[3:23:37] He returned to the fishing.
[3:23:41] Some brothers went to a mouse.
[3:23:48] Uh we don't want to hear this happening
[3:23:52] here.
[3:23:57] So celebrating the going to glory of the
[3:24:00] pastor.
[3:24:06] I feel myself that he was the man who
[3:24:12] you should listen what he has to say.
[3:24:16] &gt;&gt; I feel like that
[3:24:27] tabernacle.
[3:24:33] Yeah. I could take all day in my room
[3:24:36] close the day listening only.
[3:24:41] I felt very profound things
[3:24:47] that helped me.
[3:24:54] So I tried I I I start to to to find a
[3:24:59] way to get inside that that sea that
[3:25:03] beach.
[3:25:07] But today I'm satisfied. I'm very
[3:25:09] content because
[3:25:12] don't ask me how I did it.
[3:25:17] I'm happy because I in the middle of the
[3:25:20] brothers
[3:25:25] was a very humble man.
[3:25:29] &gt;&gt; It was a man
[3:25:36] who could get inside Mozambique.
[3:25:41] Mozambi is not like South Africa,
[3:25:48] &gt;&gt; but he went through the jungles of
[3:25:51] Mozambique.
[3:25:54] Speaking about, we are talking about a
[3:25:56] city,
[3:26:02] but he went inside the depths of
[3:26:05] Mozambique.
[3:26:09] We are talking about Mach where the
[3:26:11] brother come from.
[3:26:14] It's a Dick Street.
[3:26:18] We are talking about Vanuzi.
[3:26:23] We are talking about also
[3:26:27] &gt;&gt; talking about this places
[3:26:32] some people here couldn't done it
[3:26:36] but he got there
[3:26:40] sleeped there
[3:26:44] he
[3:26:45] ate there
[3:26:50] this humility many of us we can't do it
[3:26:56] that's why in this this time I give
[3:26:59] thanks
[3:27:05] to be here celebrating the the the his
[3:27:09] life
[3:27:14] in my heart I I felt that he is not
[3:27:19] dead.
[3:27:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet of the time said,
[3:27:27] &gt;&gt; he said that the the debt for a a a
[3:27:31] believer.
[3:27:35] It's only the transfer from one
[3:27:36] dimension to another.
[3:27:41] I believe that our pastor is not dead.
[3:27:47] He is somewhere
[3:27:51] &gt;&gt; one of these days
[3:27:54] we will be together with him.
[3:28:00] We want to encourage
[3:28:04] &gt;&gt; in the name of all our all Mozambicans.
[3:28:11] &gt;&gt; The sister who a sister who were left by
[3:28:14] pastor his wife
[3:28:20] to be to to to maintain in what your
[3:28:24] husband was doing.
[3:28:31] That day beyond the curtain of time,
[3:28:37] &gt;&gt; we will be with our pastor.
[3:28:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[3:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Professor as he comes
[3:28:54] &gt;&gt; while he's coming there is a
[3:28:56] MercedesBenz seatless white in colored
[3:29:02] &gt;&gt; registration is LN46
[3:29:05] &gt;&gt; registration LN46
[3:29:07] &gt;&gt; TRGP
[3:29:08] &gt;&gt; TRGP
[3:29:09] &gt;&gt; LN46 TRGP LN46 TRGP
[3:29:13] &gt;&gt; Just remove it. It's just standing in
[3:29:16] the way.
[3:29:18] God bless you.
[3:29:22] Greetings saints.
[3:29:26] &gt;&gt; I am standing here to speak on behalf of
[3:29:29] all Malawians
[3:29:33] who have been greatly touched by the
[3:29:35] ministry of our pastor.
[3:29:39] The best would have been pastoring to
[3:29:41] deliver this.
[3:29:47] But as we see, he has another due date.
[3:29:51] So I've come with a few Malawians.
[3:29:55] My wife, she can stand up
[3:29:59] and also my sister, my brother-in-law,
[3:30:05] they stay here in Ptoria. Amen.
[3:30:09] &gt;&gt; But uh my pastor pastor
[3:30:14] said please
[3:30:16] represent Malawi there
[3:30:20] &gt;&gt; because
[3:30:24] somehow he had some soft spot
[3:30:29] spot
[3:30:30] &gt;&gt; for Malawi
[3:30:33] Malawi. He started feasting Malawi in
[3:30:36] the early days.
[3:30:40] In those days,
[3:30:42] he would drive all by himself
[3:30:47] 2,000 kilometers
[3:30:50] to come and preach in Malaw.
[3:30:55] [applause]
[3:30:56] You talk of a life of service
[3:31:00] that someone who has lived a purpose for
[3:31:03] God.
[3:31:07] The prophet talks about flowers.
[3:31:11] They come out and then they give
[3:31:13] fragments
[3:31:16] and they go, the bees take out some food
[3:31:18] from them.
[3:31:22] Then they go, they have saved their
[3:31:24] life.
[3:31:28] Pastor
[3:31:30] has saved his life.
[3:31:36] Pastor Kima preached for a number of
[3:31:38] people
[3:31:40] in the early days. He ped he preached in
[3:31:42] Zumba for pastor.
[3:31:48] He preached for pastor.
[3:31:51] Both of these are already gone to glory.
[3:31:55] He continued to preach for pastor in
[3:31:58] area 18.
[3:32:01] Then he came and preached for my pastor
[3:32:04] pastor
[3:32:07] in 2011 2011 and we were honored that my
[3:32:11] family hosted him
[3:32:15] with brother
[3:32:18] and that's how we became closer.
[3:32:22] He invited us to be meetings.
[3:32:26] Then we just clicked.
[3:32:29] We were honored that he called me his
[3:32:31] friend.
[3:32:34] As he has called many people,
[3:32:38] it reminds me
[3:32:40] what the Bible says.
[3:32:43] If you receive a prophet in the name of
[3:32:45] prophet,
[3:32:48] you shall receive a prophet's reward.
[3:32:52] And someone asked the prophet William
[3:32:54] Brham.
[3:32:56] Someone asked the prophet William Brham.
[3:32:58] Someone asked asked.
[3:33:04] The Bible talks about a prophet's
[3:33:05] reward.
[3:33:08] What is this prophet's reward?
[3:33:11] Or righteous man's reward. Or righteous
[3:33:14] man's reward. Righteous man.
[3:33:20] The the answer was very simple.
[3:33:24] The prophet says the prophet's reward is
[3:33:27] to be his friend.
[3:33:32] So all of us are the friends because we
[3:33:35] received pastor
[3:33:40] and the prophet continued that one day
[3:33:44] it will do you good.
[3:33:47] When you a prophet when you are a friend
[3:33:49] to a prophet
[3:33:51] one day he'll pray for you.
[3:33:54] When you're friend to a prophet
[3:33:57] one day you'll be with him.
[3:33:59] And we believe we'll be with pastor
[3:34:03] because we received him as our pastor
[3:34:07] and therefore we have become his friend.
[3:34:10] So all of us are his friend.
[3:34:15] I wish in a special way to thank
[3:34:17] pastoring
[3:34:21] who in the later days has been a great
[3:34:24] connector between Modi and Malawi.
[3:34:30] to a point where when he was
[3:34:32] constructing his house,
[3:34:36] he dedicated one room that this is
[3:34:38] pastor's room.
[3:34:43] Such a love,
[3:34:45] such a great love.
[3:34:48] And uh it so happened that in in 2022
[3:34:54] uh pastor pastoring's son was getting
[3:34:57] married
[3:35:01] and of course because of the wedding
[3:35:04] there were so many people from his
[3:35:05] village
[3:35:09] and he requested our house to host
[3:35:12] pastor
[3:35:13] for a few days.
[3:35:18] We were privileged to host him.
[3:35:22] Little did we know that that was his
[3:35:24] last time to come to Malawi.
[3:35:29] We always value and enjoy pastor.
[3:35:37] Each time we come to their house with
[3:35:39] mama,
[3:35:42] he would take us in a special way with
[3:35:44] my wife.
[3:35:47] We would ask him questions.
[3:35:50] He tell us testimonies. Testimonies
[3:35:54] out of his heart.
[3:35:57] A true and great friend.
[3:36:02] Our daughter
[3:36:04] got married
[3:36:06] and during their honeymoon they came to
[3:36:08] see him this year
[3:36:12] on 8th June 2025.
[3:36:16] June 25. But for me and my wife, our
[3:36:18] last encounter with pastor
[3:36:23] was on 3rd June 3rd August
[3:36:28] 2025.
[3:36:30] This is the time when a lot of members
[3:36:32] came to the wedding of pastoring's
[3:36:35] daughter.
[3:36:39] As we as we all dancing around
[3:36:46] He had his daughter Dodo
[3:36:50] was speaking to him via a video WhatsApp
[3:36:53] call
[3:36:55] WhatsApp. Then she called us
[3:36:59] to come and speak to him.
[3:37:02] When we saw the him on the WhatsApp
[3:37:05] calls,
[3:37:08] he brightened up in a very special way.
[3:37:14] He said
[3:37:17] &gt;&gt; this year,
[3:37:19] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to Malawi
[3:37:21] &gt;&gt; and I'll be at your house.
[3:37:26] Those words,
[3:37:28] we will never forget them.
[3:37:32] He will not come to Malawi physically
[3:37:36] but pastor is with us
[3:37:41] through the message that has impacted
[3:37:44] our lives.
[3:37:49] His message that he has preached to
[3:37:51] Malawians
[3:37:55] will live on.
[3:37:57] And that's the message
[3:37:59] that has taken us closer to Christ
[3:38:03] closer to the message of the hour.
[3:38:06] And with those words that he preached to
[3:38:08] us
[3:38:11] one day
[3:38:13] very shortly
[3:38:15] we shall be together with him.
[3:38:18] God bless you. God bless you.
[3:38:21] Hallelujah.
[3:38:24] One less than one week. Yes.
[3:38:35] The one in front of you
[3:38:39] as pastor mentioned
[3:38:44] from
[3:38:47] mine is just short
[3:38:53] to me. Pastor was my father to me both
[3:38:56] spiritually and physically.
[3:39:02] He was again my brother.
[3:39:07] He was again my friend.
[3:39:12] But the part that I love the most in him
[3:39:18] is that time when I called him a
[3:39:20] captain.
[3:39:22] Why am I saying that he's a captain?
[3:39:26] Because he he was able
[3:39:34] that he would defeat every battle and
[3:39:37] win.
[3:39:44] There was no battle that I reported to
[3:39:46] pastor and he did not overcome.
[3:39:51] Even if it comes in, even if it comes
[3:39:53] spiritually
[3:39:56] &gt;&gt; or on earth
[3:39:58] or from the water,
[3:40:04] but I would be more happy if it would
[3:40:06] come from underworld
[3:40:10] because that's where he would now defeat
[3:40:12] it.
[3:40:15] That's why I call
[3:40:18] is my captain.
[3:40:22] We a church.
[3:40:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what kind of a disease
[3:40:28] is
[3:40:31] all the difficult diseases.
[3:40:34] It could be cancer.
[3:40:37] It might be diabetes, HIV, it could be
[3:40:41] HIV.
[3:40:44] But if it reaches to my captain, the one
[3:40:46] that I'm speaking about now,
[3:40:49] we all bow down and leave. That is the
[3:40:52] reason I call him.
[3:40:55] &gt;&gt; He is my captain.
[3:41:00] He is also your captain.
[3:41:07] He introduced to us
[3:41:10] the dead pool
[3:41:12] and the revelation of the seven seal.
[3:41:21] He told us that when we combine these
[3:41:22] two, the devil stand no chance.
[3:41:31] Even today, the devil does not have
[3:41:33] power over the third pool and the
[3:41:35] church.
[3:41:36] If you combine the two,
[3:41:39] the devil flee.
[3:41:42] May the Lord bless us.
[3:41:46] I am certain
[3:41:51] because this is my second pastor.
[3:41:56] I I first lost.
[3:42:01] I know the pain of losing the pastor.
[3:42:05] Now it's happening again to me.
[3:42:09] I'm now losing.
[3:42:13] But here is what I'm saying to the
[3:42:15] church.
[3:42:17] God is God is and God is alive.
[3:42:24] If we would stay in the teachings of
[3:42:26] Pastor,
[3:42:29] we will see where we going.
[3:42:34] I would like to close with this
[3:42:40] dimension that pastor used to teach us
[3:42:42] about the sixth dimension
[3:42:46] where there's a prophet now
[3:42:51] where is
[3:42:55] and where others are.
[3:43:00] I'm imagine when they see him coming,
[3:43:04] they all stood on their feet.
[3:43:08] &gt;&gt; They said, "You fought a good fight."
[3:43:10] &gt;&gt; 50 years of the ministry.
[3:43:12] &gt;&gt; 50 years.
[3:43:14] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the sixth dimension.
[3:43:23] We are coming. You are the one that you
[3:43:25] are going to usher us.
[3:43:31] and and and introduce us.
[3:43:36] We will never lose sight of that.
[3:43:40] We are thankful with his few words
[3:43:44] and thank
[3:43:48] Amen. The patience that he has. Amen.
[3:43:52] I'm giving you recommendations. Thank
[3:43:55] you so much.
[3:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:43:58] God bless.
[3:44:06] &gt;&gt; Greetings to the beloved bride of the
[3:44:10] Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:44:14] &gt;&gt; This is Joseph, the son [music] of
[3:44:18] Israel.
[3:44:23] Joseph is a flame born by the fire
[3:44:26] called Israel.
[3:44:33] &gt;&gt; Um my pastor has given me very few
[3:44:36] minutes. I won't be long.
[3:44:40] I'm standing here children of God on
[3:44:42] behalf of the saints in
[3:44:49] if I could be given 10 hours I won't
[3:44:52] finish the testimony
[3:44:58] of the impact
[3:45:03] of the ministry
[3:45:06] of the third pool
[3:45:10] and that third pool being a man.
[3:45:14] That man being Joseph's father.
[3:45:20] &gt;&gt; Pastor Salm.
[3:45:23] My beloved pastor.

[3:45:40] remember that? My brother,
[3:45:43] you said to me,

[3:45:50] is to find God,
[3:45:53] wearing a suit and a tie
[3:45:57] and stand behind that God."
[3:46:00] God bless you, my brother.
[3:46:04] Amen.
[3:46:08] God bless as we stand to our feet
[3:46:13] and then we're not going to take time
[3:46:18] immediately after the pastor is done

[3:51:39] to Omar.
[3:51:42] Uh
[3:51:44] the best I would have done here
[3:51:48] is to start crying.
[3:51:52] But God has taught me how to cry.
[3:51:56] I just have to preach
[3:52:00] because that's the way the pastor taught
[3:52:02] me how to cry.
[3:52:08] The best way to ventilate
[3:52:13] is to preach.
[3:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[3:52:19] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[3:52:22] Gracious Lord, we deem it as a great
[3:52:24] privilege once again that we are here.
[3:52:27] Thank you for the gift which you given
[3:52:29] to us
[3:52:30] &gt;&gt; in a form of pastor Kodima.
[3:52:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Now that he has pleased you to
[3:52:34] take him or out of us, Father God, want
[3:52:37] to celebrate his life.
[3:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:39] &gt;&gt; We're not going to get tired here.
[3:52:41] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:52:42] &gt;&gt; As he would have not kept and tired had
[3:52:44] been it was me who had died.
[3:52:47] &gt;&gt; I know Pastor Kim would have been there.
[3:52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:50] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't have gotten tired.
[3:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:52] &gt;&gt; And I as one of the people who have
[3:52:55] benefited from his ministry,
[3:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52:57] &gt;&gt; I want to do the same for him.
[3:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if the sun can rise up when
[3:53:01] we are here, I'll not get tired.
[3:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:04] &gt;&gt; Because I know a man.
[3:53:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:53:08] &gt;&gt; Who was behind that man?
[3:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for what you've done
[3:53:12] for us.
[3:53:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:53:14] &gt;&gt; Giving us an example.
[3:53:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:53:15] &gt;&gt; Such a good example.
[3:53:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:53:17] &gt;&gt; And we know
[3:53:19] &gt;&gt; that he has told us
[3:53:21] &gt;&gt; there is a better place behind the veil.
[3:53:24] &gt;&gt; And he has gone beyond beyond us as
[3:53:27] committing ourselves into holy hands.
[3:53:29] Father in Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[3:53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:41] &gt;&gt; Um a lot of people have told about uh
[3:53:44] friendship with pastor.
[3:53:49] Uh I will not tell you much.
[3:53:54] Um pastor I first saw him in 1990.
[3:54:01] We talked
[3:54:03] over the years.
[3:54:06] I was his driver there. Here
[3:54:13] from 1990
[3:54:16] we were meeting very often
[3:54:22] because Malawi was his home.
[3:54:26] Amen.
[3:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:54:28] But uh we only became friends
[3:54:32] uh after 24 years
[3:54:36] of interaction
[3:54:39] driving him around
[3:54:44] but because I was younger
[3:54:47] then I was going higher.
[3:54:50] As the African proverb says,
[3:54:55] if a child washes his hands well,
[3:55:00] he can eat with the elders.
[3:55:05] Hallelujah.
[3:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So from being his driver
[3:55:10] and his caretaker
[3:55:14] and uh we became friends
[3:55:18] and u we saw each other more not le not
[3:55:22] less than three times a year.
[3:55:29] I'll be at his house.
[3:55:32] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[3:55:36] This thing is not working, isn't it?
[3:55:38] &gt;&gt; No,
[3:55:39] &gt;&gt; it's not.
[3:55:40] &gt;&gt; It's not working.
[3:55:41] &gt;&gt; Okay, it's not working. It's good that
[3:55:43] it's not working.
[3:55:45] &gt;&gt; Uh because I would have I would have
[3:55:46] taken you till your morning because I
[3:55:47] had some videos.
[3:55:52] Amen. Amen.
[3:55:53] &gt;&gt; So,
[3:55:55] to me has been a very good leader.
[3:56:02] You know nowadays
[3:56:04] &gt;&gt; we got this type of generals
[3:56:09] a general
[3:56:12] sends his soldiers to battle
[3:56:17] and he goes to hide in a banker
[3:56:22] a
[3:56:23] supposed to go in front
[3:56:27] and to tell you
[3:56:29] I am in front.
[3:56:32] So, pastor has gone in front
[3:56:36] to say to me,
[3:56:38] don't fear.
[3:56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56:42] &gt;&gt; So, don't fear.
[3:56:45] &gt;&gt; Our pastor's gone in front of us.
[3:56:50] We will go where he is
[3:56:54] because we are believing what he
[3:56:56] preached.
[3:56:59] Amen.
[3:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:57:00] &gt;&gt; So don't fear
[3:57:03] our pastor's going to be in front of us.
[3:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:57:09] &gt;&gt; So let's start from reading from the
[3:57:10] book of u Psalms.
[3:57:18] &gt;&gt; Psalms 42.
[3:57:21] from there. Then we
[3:57:24] um
[3:57:28] read one
[3:57:29] &gt;&gt; verse one and you can sit down and I
[3:57:31] will continue.
[3:57:35] &gt;&gt; Don't worry even if you sleep I will
[3:57:37] still preach.
[3:57:48] Amen. Is there anybody to read for me?
[3:57:50] Okay.
[3:57:51] &gt;&gt; Psalms 42 verse one.
[3:57:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:57:55] &gt;&gt; As the heart pentth after the water
[3:57:58] brooks, so pentth my soul after thee, oh
[3:58:02] God.
[3:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:58:06] &gt;&gt; We can be seated.
[3:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58:10] &gt;&gt; So a heart
[3:58:13] panteth after water
[3:58:17] &gt;&gt; because for the heart
[3:58:20] Water is life.
[3:58:23] Even if your heart is injured
[3:58:27] once it drinks water,
[3:58:30] it rejuvenates
[3:58:32] and my soul
[3:58:35] panteth after thee, oh God,
[3:58:39] my brother, my sister, so many times
[3:58:42] have I come
[3:58:44] to be with a pastor
[3:58:47] when he was in the hospital.
[3:58:49] when he was at home.
[3:58:52] Not in a day
[3:58:54] did I hear him saying,
[3:58:57] "My brother, I am worried. I'm going to
[3:59:02] die."
[3:59:05] He never feared death because he saw
[3:59:10] punted after God.
[3:59:14] Why do we p after God?
[3:59:17] goes within us.
[3:59:19] There is a deep call going to the deep.
[3:59:25] Hallelujah. You know my brother, my
[3:59:28] sister,
[3:59:29] this life
[3:59:31] is good.
[3:59:33] The same life
[3:59:35] which you can be coughing,
[3:59:38] you can have HIV,
[3:59:41] you can have TP,
[3:59:43] people say it is good.
[3:59:46] What about that eternal life? How good
[3:59:48] is it?
[3:59:52] Why don't I p after it?
[3:59:58] That's right.
[4:00:01] If this life
[4:00:04] with all its problems
[4:00:07] is good,
[4:00:10] how good is that eternal life?
[4:00:15] How good is it?
[4:00:20] That's why my soul
[4:00:23] p after thee, oh God.
[4:00:27] Now, how do we talk about these things?
[4:00:31] How did we know that is there's eternal
[4:00:33] life?
[4:00:36] Because if you go to Psalms 42:2 says,
[4:00:41] "My soul
[4:00:43] is for God.
[4:00:47] How did you get that faith for God?
[4:00:51] Is because from the beginning
[4:00:54] you have tested that face.
[4:01:00] You cannot forel unless you've drunk
[4:01:02] Castell before.
[4:01:04] &gt;&gt; Sorry, you cannot test for Castel beer.
[4:01:16] I am testing for eternal life
[4:01:20] because I have tested it before.
[4:01:28] None of you have ever been to Malawi.
[4:01:33] Oh, there's Professor Gunda. Yes.
[4:01:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, Professor. Okay. God bless you,
[4:01:37] Professor Gund.
[4:01:38] I'll tell you people
[4:01:41] the only thing which you know is grapes
[4:01:43] and what and what and
[4:01:47] there are those natural fruits
[4:01:51] people who have been in a country which
[4:01:53] they know of
[4:01:57] they will thirst for things
[4:01:59] which
[4:02:01] their mother taught them
[4:02:04] this is food you cannot thirst for
[4:02:08] something which you have never have a
[4:02:10] desire before.
[4:02:15] When you just when you are thirsting for
[4:02:18] something,
[4:02:20] it's either it's missing from your body
[4:02:25] or you have tested it before
[4:02:29] the body cause
[4:02:32] for that specific element.
[4:02:35] element which went missing from our
[4:02:38] bodies.
[4:02:41] One day they found a boy
[4:02:44] who was eating raba.
[4:02:47] When they made they tested him they
[4:02:50] found that in his body
[4:02:53] the safer levels were low.
[4:02:58] So he was trying to repress that suffer
[4:03:04] in him. His body was calling for suffer.
[4:03:10] That's why my body now
[4:03:13] is crying for eternal life
[4:03:15] because in me
[4:03:18] I am longing for that eternal life
[4:03:22] because it has gone out of me
[4:03:26] through Adam.
[4:03:29] Now I myself
[4:03:32] I am thinking
[4:03:34] &gt;&gt; as a young man came to brother to to to
[4:03:37] Jesus
[4:03:39] Jesus I have observed all the rules
[4:03:44] I've been good but I am missing eternal
[4:03:47] life
[4:03:54] anybody who is missing eternal life
[4:03:59] will be looking for it. If I'm looking
[4:04:02] for it, that means eternal life is not
[4:04:04] ours
[4:04:07] because the Bible says, "Seek and shall
[4:04:11] be given." If you don't seek eternal
[4:04:13] life
[4:04:16] be given to you
[4:04:23] because this message
[4:04:26] is for those who are looking for it
[4:04:32] because when Andrew Andrew comes to
[4:04:35] Peter he doesn't want to he didn't
[4:04:38] explain to him
[4:04:40] there was no way to convince
[4:04:45] Peter, we have found him.
[4:04:49] That was enough
[4:04:53] because from the beginning they were
[4:04:56] looking for him.
[4:04:58] Jesus will never come to you.
[4:05:01] They were not looking for him.
[4:05:05] When Philip comes to Nathaniel,
[4:05:08] he tells him, "We have found him."
[4:05:14] &gt;&gt; And they asked,
[4:05:15] &gt;&gt; he asked, "Where is he from?"
[4:05:20] &gt;&gt; Where is he from?
[4:05:26] He's from Malawi.
[4:05:27] &gt;&gt; Malawi.
[4:05:29] &gt;&gt; The way how Malawi, how can he come from
[4:05:31] Malawi?
[4:05:36] We need preachers from America, not from
[4:05:43] Yes. It's like that in the Bible.
[4:05:45] They were speaking Arabic. They were
[4:05:48] speaking Greek.
[4:05:50] The the messengers, the other people
[4:05:52] said, "These are Malawians up there. How
[4:05:56] can they speak Greek?"
[4:06:01] Right?
[4:06:04] They were people of a low quality.
[4:06:08] When they come to their country, they
[4:06:09] were mad dubbers.
[4:06:12] But God visited those people.
[4:06:20] They were Galileans.
[4:06:22] When the Greeks come to to ask for
[4:06:24] Jesus,
[4:06:26] what did they ask for?
[4:06:29] &gt;&gt; Philip. Philip. and he was a Galian.
[4:06:32] These are Greeks, very educated people,
[4:06:37] very
[4:06:39] people deep in science.
[4:06:43] But who did they ask to find Jesus?
[4:06:48] They asked who? Philip. And he was from
[4:06:51] where?
[4:06:53] The Bible says he was from where?
[4:06:55] He was from Galilee.
[4:07:00] Let me take an example of South Africa.
[4:07:04] He was from
[4:07:11] a man from Pritoria is asking from
[4:07:14] I want to see Jesus.
[4:07:21] Ask the man from
[4:07:24] he show you Jesus.
[4:07:27] Jesus
[4:07:33] &gt;&gt; before in they don't talk about
[4:07:36] Lamborghinis and masalates and whatever
[4:07:43] they just talking about Jesus there
[4:07:46] they will see Jesus before you
[4:07:50] ask them where is Jesus they will tell
[4:07:54] you where he is
[4:07:56] Because
[4:07:58] &gt;&gt; Philip Philip
[4:07:59] &gt;&gt; and Andrew Andrew
[4:08:01] &gt;&gt; and Nathaniel
[4:08:03] &gt;&gt; when they were in their home country
[4:08:07] they talked nothing else apart from how
[4:08:10] is the Messiah going to be
[4:08:13] that's why you find all these people who
[4:08:16] were telling each other we have found
[4:08:19] him they were Galians
[4:08:27] Hey, when he woke up,
[4:08:31] &gt;&gt; where did he go?
[4:08:33] &gt;&gt; Tell them,
[4:08:34] &gt;&gt; "Where have I gone?"
[4:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now, when we are here,
[4:08:46] &gt;&gt; we are supposed to miss something.
[4:08:50] My brother, I don't know what what what
[4:08:52] what who are you and where you come
[4:08:54] from, but if you are not missing God,
[4:08:59] you have missed everything.
[4:09:06] If you have missed God,
[4:09:10] you have missed everything.
[4:09:14] Let me be clear.
[4:09:16] If you have missed the prophet of
[4:09:18] Malachi 4,
[4:09:22] you have missed everything
[4:09:27] because we came here to wait for the
[4:09:30] coming
[4:09:32] of the prophet who was going to restore
[4:09:35] the hearts
[4:09:38] of the children back to the fathers.
[4:09:42] That's the reason why we are here. Hey
[4:09:45] my brother, we're not here to get rich.
[4:09:52] &gt;&gt; We were coming here
[4:09:55] &gt;&gt; to wait for his advent.
[4:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[4:10:06] &gt;&gt; We are coming. We are here to wait for
[4:10:10] his coming.
[4:10:14] Whatever comes after that
[4:10:18] is just something to keep us maybe
[4:10:21] fresh.
[4:10:25] But what we came home
[4:10:28] to come for this coming
[4:10:33] to await for his coming.
[4:10:37] Whether we are going to sleep,
[4:10:40] whether we are going to meet him, that
[4:10:42] doesn't matter.
[4:10:44] Because what we are doing here
[4:10:48] &gt;&gt; is waiting.
[4:10:54] &gt;&gt; We have come here to wait for him
[4:10:59] and sometimes we forget
[4:11:02] &gt;&gt; that we are waiting for him.
[4:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:11:08] But if you come to Psalms 42:7,
[4:11:13] what does he say?
[4:11:16] The deep go of the deep.
[4:11:23] The deep in me
[4:11:28] is calling for the deep.
[4:11:34] that something inside me,
[4:11:37] something inside me
[4:11:40] is calling for something somewhere.
[4:11:44] When an eagle calls,
[4:11:47] it will be eagles who are going to
[4:11:49] answer.
[4:11:51] Chickens will not answer.
[4:11:54] Ducks will not answer.
[4:11:56] If a heart calls,
[4:11:59] it's a kid who's going to answer.
[4:12:02] Everybody else is nonsense.
[4:12:05] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[4:12:08] &gt;&gt; That is why when the message of the hour
[4:12:11] came to call,
[4:12:13] some of us answered,
[4:12:16] some of people didn't know anything
[4:12:19] because the deep call to the deep.
[4:12:28] Who was calling?
[4:12:30] Why has he called us?
[4:12:34] Why have we been called?
[4:12:37] You are South African.
[4:12:40] &gt;&gt; You are Zian.
[4:12:42] &gt;&gt; You are.
[4:12:44] &gt;&gt; Why have you been called?
[4:12:47] Right?
[4:12:49] Why have you been called?
[4:12:52] Because we have to know why have we been
[4:12:54] called.
[4:12:57] So if you come to Romans 1:7,
[4:13:01] 1:7
[4:13:03] Why have we been called?
[4:13:06] &gt;&gt; You are there my brother. Romans 1:57
[4:13:16] to all that be in Rome. Beloved of God
[4:13:21] called to be saints.
[4:13:23] &gt;&gt; Called to be saints.
[4:13:27] What have we been called to be?
[4:13:32] The caller has called me
[4:13:36] &gt;&gt; to be a saint.
[4:13:40] Amen. Amen.
[4:13:42] He called me
[4:13:45] to be a saint.
[4:13:48] That's right.
[4:13:51] &gt;&gt; We have been called to be saints.
[4:13:54] &gt;&gt; He called us He justified us. He
[4:13:58] sanctified us and he gave us the gift of
[4:14:02] the Holy Ghost.
[4:14:04] None of that is the work of man.
[4:14:10] Amen. Amen.
[4:14:11] &gt;&gt; You know there can be an advocate in
[4:14:13] this country.
[4:14:16] The the South African army can say
[4:14:21] we need recruits.
[4:14:24] So they call all the people in South
[4:14:25] Africa
[4:14:28] and they very they are very very
[4:14:30] specific.
[4:14:33] We want people
[4:14:36] not not weak ones
[4:14:39] to become the army of South Africa.
[4:14:43] They don't just take everybody.
[4:14:49] They recruit people.
[4:14:52] H they gave them into the army.
[4:14:58] So you know sometimes
[4:15:00] uh people come into the army
[4:15:04] with their own clothes.
[4:15:06] No no no no. If you come to the army you
[4:15:10] have to wear the clothes of the army.
[4:15:14] You have to throw away your Gucci and
[4:15:16] the
[4:15:23] They give you a specific type of clothes
[4:15:25] you have to wear.
[4:15:29] Whether your father is rich or poor,
[4:15:31] they say here, there's no poor. There's
[4:15:35] no rich one for
[4:15:44] there's no
[4:15:47] nothing. Here
[4:15:52] we were only battle fatigues,
[4:15:57] combat gear.
[4:16:01] That's right.
[4:16:04] They don't have the physique.
[4:16:07] They train them.
[4:16:10] They give them good food
[4:16:14] so that they could have physique.
[4:16:21] If you start giving your army in combo
[4:16:22] today, the army will not fight.
[4:16:31] &gt;&gt; The army needs to be given food
[4:16:36] to make it strong
[4:16:39] to make their muscles grow.
[4:16:45] &gt;&gt; Brother says,
[4:16:47] Even if the word
[4:16:50] is true,
[4:16:53] &gt;&gt; the word is a sword.
[4:16:57] A sword
[4:16:58] &gt;&gt; is useless
[4:17:01] in a weak hand.
[4:17:06] Even if the word is so sharp,
[4:17:10] but
[4:17:11] the hand is weak,
[4:17:14] it will never cut.
[4:17:19] The hand is the sword is supposed to be
[4:17:22] held by a strong hand of faith.
[4:17:29] So that's why they take them down.
[4:17:33] Give me 50.
[4:17:35] They know even if I got good guns
[4:17:37] without muscles it was nothing.
[4:17:45] They don't have guns,
[4:17:48] they give to them.
[4:17:50] They don't have aircraft.
[4:17:53] They give it to them because the army
[4:17:57] has to fight in the air has to fight on
[4:18:00] land, has to fight in the seas,
[4:18:07] &gt;&gt; who gives them
[4:18:09] the one who called them.
[4:18:17] If your God who has called you is not
[4:18:19] giving you arament
[4:18:24] to win a battle against the miner
[4:18:37] because the battles which you are
[4:18:39] fighting
[4:18:41] your general
[4:18:44] &gt;&gt; is supposed to give you the equipment.
[4:18:48] If you're going to fight in the sea,
[4:18:51] your general should give you equipment
[4:18:53] to fight in the sea.
[4:18:57] Fight in the air.
[4:18:59] You are supposed to have equipment to
[4:19:00] fight in the air.
[4:19:05] If you're going to fight on land, you're
[4:19:07] supposed to have equipment to fight on
[4:19:09] land.
[4:19:12] Amen. Amen. We have called.
[4:19:16] &gt;&gt; We have been called.
[4:19:17] &gt;&gt; The caller is supposed to give us the
[4:19:20] equipment we need to fight this battle.
[4:19:27] &gt;&gt; We have been, we have been called.
[4:19:31] God cannot make a mistake in
[4:19:32] recruitment.
[4:19:39] &gt;&gt; God doesn't run a corrupt government
[4:19:41] like Malawi.
[4:19:50] Because if you run your recruitment by
[4:19:54] corruption,
[4:19:58] you're going to be in trouble.
[4:20:04] &gt;&gt; When you are recruiting somebody,
[4:20:07] make sure he's fit for the job.
[4:20:15] So he called us,
[4:20:19] he forneew us,
[4:20:21] he pred predestinated us.
[4:20:26] And 2 Corinthians 4:3 says,
[4:20:30] &gt;&gt; "But if our gospel,
[4:20:34] &gt;&gt; it is he,
[4:20:35] &gt;&gt; if is he,
[4:20:37] &gt;&gt; it is he to them that are lost, Our
[4:20:44] gospel is in the open.
[4:20:49] Even a fool cannot in it.
[4:20:57] Hallelujah.
[4:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is everybody with me here?
[4:21:03] I can't hear amen.
[4:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's too slow. Too too long.
[4:21:12] Amen.
[4:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:21] &gt;&gt; He has called us.
[4:21:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me continue.
[4:21:29] &gt;&gt; He has done what?
[4:21:32] &gt;&gt; He has called us.
[4:21:34] &gt;&gt; I want to go further.
[4:21:36] &gt;&gt; Revelation 16. Revelation 1:6.
[4:21:38] &gt;&gt; He has called us religion.
[4:21:46] &gt;&gt; And hath made us kings and priests unto
[4:21:49] God and his father.
[4:21:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:52] &gt;&gt; He has called us.
[4:21:54] &gt;&gt; And he has even made us.
[4:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:22:00] &gt;&gt; Hey my brother,
[4:22:01] &gt;&gt; we are so favored.
[4:22:04] &gt;&gt; We have been called.
[4:22:06] We have been made.
[4:22:13] &gt;&gt; I'm leading a quote here.
[4:22:15] &gt;&gt; My brother here is my is a my witness.
[4:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:22:19] &gt;&gt; Problem says he has made us.
[4:22:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, there are certain truths
[4:22:29] we need to emphasize.
[4:22:32] This is one of them.
[4:22:35] He
[4:22:37] he has made us.
[4:22:42] &gt;&gt; Salvation
[4:22:44] is his doing.
[4:22:48] &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord.
[4:22:52] All grace.
[4:22:54] He redeemed us for a purpose.
[4:23:01] &gt;&gt; He bought us for a purpose.
[4:23:05] We are kings.
[4:23:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[4:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[4:23:50] Read it my brother. Read it. They they
[4:23:52] have to read it.
[4:23:53] &gt;&gt; We are kings.
[4:23:56] Amen.
[4:24:01] &gt;&gt; Unless you don't want to be, but I am.
[4:24:09] &gt;&gt; Spiritual kings.
[4:24:14] We are going to be kings upon earth with
[4:24:16] him.
[4:24:19] when he sits on his throne.
[4:24:22] But now
[4:24:27] we are spiritual kings.
[4:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's why you see I I walk like a king.
[4:24:37] You not see me at the bar because I'm a
[4:24:40] king.
[4:24:44] You you want a king to be at the bar.
[4:24:54] You know when kings we speak, we speak
[4:24:56] good.
[4:25:00] If I want to speak the the kings,
[4:25:05] let me speak the king's English.
[4:25:12] &gt;&gt; I want to I I do not want to be labor
[4:25:15] you to give me that bott of water.

[4:25:34] someone in my class.
[4:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:25:40] [applause]
[4:25:43] &gt;&gt; You are king. You're supposed to speak
[4:25:45] like a king.
[4:25:51] Too many times you're speaking like juju
[4:26:00] and you a king.
[4:26:09] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to speak like a king.
[4:26:15] What type of king can start a war in a
[4:26:17] in a village? Are you a king in the
[4:26:19] village?
[4:26:28] Can a king start a war in the village?
[4:26:36] &gt;&gt; Because you are a king. You are supposed
[4:26:39] to pissy people.
[4:26:44] Put the people's hearts down.
[4:26:50] &gt;&gt; We reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[4:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27:00] &gt;&gt; We are kings.
[4:27:03] &gt;&gt; We have a spiritual kingdom.
[4:27:06] Of course, you cannot recognize me
[4:27:10] because we don't belong to the same
[4:27:11] kingdom.
[4:27:17] You know these people from Switzerland.
[4:27:21] If the king appeared here,
[4:27:24] the king of Swan appears here,
[4:27:27] you'd have heard
[4:27:32] Those
[4:27:38] [screaming]
[4:27:43] who from Malaw will never know what it
[4:27:45] is.
[4:27:47] It's only from they will know
[4:27:52] that the king is here.
[4:27:55] Who goes in front?
[4:27:57] The crier
[4:28:00] to tell everything what the king has
[4:28:01] done.
[4:28:09] All of us will be wondering what's
[4:28:11] happening.
[4:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:21] &gt;&gt; Because
[4:28:22] we are of a different kingdom.
[4:28:27] They will never understand.
[4:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:33] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[4:28:35] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[4:28:37] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[4:28:38] &gt;&gt; Right now, we reign with Christ having
[4:28:42] dominion over sin.
[4:28:51] Right now
[4:28:52] &gt;&gt; we learn with Christ
[4:28:55] having dominion over sin.
[4:29:01] Having dominion over the world,
[4:29:05] having dominion over the flesh.
[4:29:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord.
[4:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:29:12] &gt;&gt; Have mercy.
[4:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have mercy on this corrupt thing.
[4:29:20] How it troubles us.

[4:29:34] having dominion over the devil
[4:29:37] &gt;&gt; who having dominion over sin, the world,
[4:29:41] the flesh, and the devil.

[4:29:47] [applause]
[4:29:47] &gt;&gt; We have dominion
[4:29:50] over the devil.
[4:29:52] &gt;&gt; If you are not having dominion over the
[4:29:54] devil,
[4:29:56] ask yourself,
[4:29:58] who called you?
[4:30:01] Who is giving you the equipment to
[4:30:03] fight?
[4:30:08] &gt;&gt; Showing forth his praise
[4:30:13] and glory.
[4:30:15] Showing forth himself.
[4:30:20] For it is Christ
[4:30:22] in us,
[4:30:24] willing
[4:30:26] doing
[4:30:28] &gt;&gt; his good pleasure.
[4:30:32] &gt;&gt; Christ
[4:30:34] showing forth himself.
[4:30:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:30:39] &gt;&gt; Did because they don't know that I'm
[4:30:41] reading here.
[4:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[4:30:47] Amen.

[4:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:31:00] &gt;&gt; Christ is showing himself.
[4:31:04] &gt;&gt; Hey my brother, my sister,
[4:31:07] &gt;&gt; Christ is willing to show himself
[4:31:13] in you.
[4:31:15] Who is going to show the Christ?
[4:31:19] you.
[4:31:22] Hallelujah.
[4:31:24] Amen.
[4:31:24] &gt;&gt; If people are going to see Christ today,
[4:31:28] they just have to come to you.
[4:31:35] Christ willing
[4:31:38] and doing his good pleasure.
[4:31:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:31:45] Even now
[4:31:48] Now
[4:31:50] &gt;&gt; we are seated
[4:31:53] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places
[4:31:56] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[4:31:59] &gt;&gt; Read for them because I don't think they
[4:32:00] will.
[4:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:02] Even now we are seated in heavenly
[4:32:06] places in Christ Jesus.
[4:32:12] Now
[4:32:14] you
[4:32:16] who are there you are seated
[4:32:20] in heaven.
[4:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:35] &gt;&gt; We are seated in heavenly places.
[4:32:39] He has called us. He has made us.
[4:32:44] He has even given us seats.
[4:32:48] My brother.
[4:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:49] &gt;&gt; We are highly favored.
[4:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:58] &gt;&gt; My brother, let's continue the same
[4:32:59] verse. You find that
[4:33:02] he has made us kings. and made
[4:33:08] &gt;&gt; and hath made us kings and priests unto
[4:33:10] God and his father.
[4:33:13] &gt;&gt; He has made us priests.
[4:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching here without
[4:33:19] going to a Bible school
[4:33:22] because I was favored
[4:33:26] to be given as a priest.
[4:33:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:33:33] &gt;&gt; Unto him.
[4:33:36] offering spiritual praise of sanctified
[4:33:40] lips.
[4:33:50] Amen.
[4:33:51] Lips
[4:33:54] lips.
[4:33:57] &gt;&gt; You got so sharp lips.
[4:34:01] You you talk as if you're in parliament.
[4:34:10] Our lips are supposed to be sanctified.
[4:34:17] &gt;&gt; Our lips are supposed to talk the truth.
[4:34:23] Amen.
[4:34:26] &gt;&gt; Our lips are not supposed to be
[4:34:28] benefiting us.
[4:34:34] &gt;&gt; They are sanctified.
[4:34:38] You know the problem with us now
[4:34:42] is that we got freedom
[4:34:45] and the west enemy
[4:34:48] of Christianity
[4:34:50] is human rights.
[4:34:56] Correct.
[4:34:57] &gt;&gt; You are taking human rights
[4:35:01] from the Freedom Charter of South Africa
[4:35:05] &gt;&gt; and bring it in the message
[4:35:13] &gt;&gt; and you just cut
[4:35:24] Sanctify the lips.
[4:35:31] Spending our lives
[4:35:35] as a sweet offering unto him.
[4:35:44] Amen. Amen.
[4:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[4:35:59] you,
[4:36:02] &gt;&gt; he would have been
[4:36:04] but he has gone
[4:36:07] without making money.
[4:36:14] So who you and me who are busy trying to
[4:36:16] figure out how to make money
[4:36:22] out of this church.
[4:36:24] God bless you.
[4:36:36] The owner of the church has gone.
[4:36:42] &gt;&gt; The one who has this church has gone
[4:36:45] in you.
[4:36:47] &gt;&gt; You can live 50 years
[4:36:50] of the gospel
[4:36:52] without a Lamborghini.
[4:37:03] Hey my brother.
[4:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:37:05] &gt;&gt; That brother of mine
[4:37:07] &gt;&gt; lived a humble life.
[4:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[4:37:18] You know, if I wanted to make money
[4:37:21] here, if I'm your pastor, I can just
[4:37:22] say, can everybody just please give me
[4:37:25] just 4,000 runs?
[4:37:33] 4,000 4,000 runs. 4,000.

[4:37:42] million.
[4:37:45] You give me because I'm your pastor.
[4:37:49] You feel for me. You like me. Pastor
[4:37:53] didn't do that
[4:37:58] because he spent his life
[4:38:02] as a sweet offering to God.
[4:38:09] He would travel from here
[4:38:12] to
[4:38:14] just to speak to one poor woman.
[4:38:35] He spent his life
[4:38:40] as a sweet offering unto me.
[4:38:46] Amen. Amen.
[4:38:50] &gt;&gt; Interceding
[4:38:53] as a interced.
[4:38:57] Yeah. Yeah. Petitioning.
[4:39:06] Amen.
[4:39:10] &gt;&gt; Interceding
[4:39:13] is to pray for someone
[4:39:16] as if they were you.
[4:39:21] That's what the church of a living God
[4:39:23] supposed to do.
[4:39:27] Amen. Amen. Don't don't worry about
[4:39:30] going home.
[4:39:32] We are not going home today.
[4:39:38] [applause]
[4:39:42] Pastor Kodima is coming out of Mald
[4:39:45] Church at 11 at night because of you and
[4:39:47] you want to go home now.
[4:39:55] You can't even spend one night for him.
[4:40:04] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:40:10] &gt;&gt; Pastor was coming late. Every every
[4:40:12] Sunday was coming late.
[4:40:19] &gt;&gt; Because of you.

[4:40:26] Shame on you.
[4:40:39] The man was suffering for you.
[4:40:42] &gt;&gt; Always sleeping late,
[4:40:48] &gt;&gt; coming home late,
[4:40:51] interceding for you,
[4:40:54] &gt;&gt; petitioning for you.
[4:40:56] &gt;&gt; You can't just wait for him for just for
[4:40:58] one 24 hours.
[4:41:03] When did you last have an overnight, you
[4:41:05] people? Sorry. When did you have an
[4:41:08] overnight meeting?
[4:41:13] Overnight overnight prayer.
[4:41:15] &gt;&gt; Overnight meeting.
[4:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:41:18] &gt;&gt; The overnight is today.
[4:41:24] [applause]
[4:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are here
[4:41:32] to intercede
[4:41:34] and to petition.
[4:41:37] We are priests and kings
[4:41:40] &gt;&gt; unto our Lord.
[4:41:43] Do they know that I'm reading?
[4:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:41:46] &gt;&gt; No read.
[4:41:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Start from there.
[4:41:50] &gt;&gt; Interceding and petitioning
[4:41:53] priests and kings unto our God.
[4:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. A peculiar people
[4:42:01] zeal us into unto good works.
[4:42:07] Hey. Amen.
[4:42:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you church.
[4:42:13] You are into good works.
[4:42:18] Hey. Amen. Elders of the north. God
[4:42:20] bless you.
[4:42:25] I saw the cow which came yesterday was a
[4:42:26] nice cow.
[4:42:29] And
[4:42:31] the good thing is
[4:42:34] you did that out of a good heart. You
[4:42:38] are zealous
[4:42:40] and good works.
[4:42:42] You see sisters cleaning.
[4:42:47] Let's continue on those
[4:42:50] because our pastor
[4:42:52] taught us how to be serious on good
[4:42:55] works.
[4:43:00] He was zealous into good works. Amen.
[4:43:04] We have been recreated in him
[4:43:10] to be children
[4:43:12] like unto our father.
[4:43:16] Amen. Amen.
[4:43:17] &gt;&gt; Hey my brother. Amen.
[4:43:19] &gt;&gt; There's no better clust of people than
[4:43:20] you.
[4:43:24] God has a has a program.
[4:43:26] program,
[4:43:27] &gt;&gt; we must measure up to that program.
[4:43:34] &gt;&gt; The thing that I'm just saying,
[4:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a program and we must
[4:43:38] measure up to that program.
[4:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43:44] Because if they recruit you as a soldier
[4:43:46] in the South African army,
[4:43:51] you are supposed to measure
[4:43:54] to a soldier
[4:43:57] of that level of calling.
[4:44:05] Brother, can you measure up to your
[4:44:07] calling now?
[4:44:14] elders,
[4:44:16] &gt;&gt; can you measure up to your calling?
[4:44:22] Amen. Amen.
[4:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens is this that
[4:44:28] good friends of mine who are airline
[4:44:30] pilots,
[4:44:34] they come from home,
[4:44:37] they go into an airplane,
[4:44:40] they start it,
[4:44:44] they fly.
[4:44:46] But if you go to the to the market,
[4:44:49] you find a guy there, everyone's going
[4:44:52] pirate, pirate, pilot, 7 out
[4:44:58] &gt;&gt; because he's smoking ga.
[4:45:07] &gt;&gt; He has never flown a plane.
[4:45:10] The
[4:45:10] &gt;&gt; only fl is in his mind.
[4:45:19] &gt;&gt; He has never even flown a plane. He
[4:45:21] doesn't even he doesn't even know enough
[4:45:23] physics to go into a brain.
[4:45:30] So when you are measured up,
[4:45:36] every son of God
[4:45:38] would be trained up to the measure of
[4:45:40] their calling.
[4:45:45] John the Baptist was trained to measure
[4:45:49] up his calling.
[4:45:53] Moses was trained to measure up to the
[4:45:57] God's program.
[4:46:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was trained to measure up
[4:46:04] to the program which God was
[4:46:09] God is going to train you to measure up
[4:46:13] to the to the program which he has for
[4:46:16] you.
[4:46:18] Amen.
[4:46:23] &gt;&gt; We try to teach ministers knowledge.
[4:46:28] We want to teach them baptism of the
[4:46:29] Holy Ghost.
[4:46:35] We are a loyal priesthood,
[4:46:41] a holy nation.
[4:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a holy nation.
[4:46:50] We are a new creation.
[4:46:54] God recreating himself
[4:46:59] because God wants to show himself
[4:47:04] in you.
[4:47:06] Amen. Wherever you are at.
[4:47:13] &gt;&gt; Hey my brother.
[4:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47:15] &gt;&gt; Hey my brother.
[4:47:18] If you become super rich
[4:47:22] &gt;&gt; and you want to change a wife,
[4:47:25] you should know
[4:47:27] the program which God gave you
[4:47:31] and your measure.
[4:47:34] They're not they are different.
[4:47:39] Amen.
[4:47:39] &gt;&gt; Because if God gives you something,
[4:47:42] he's supposed to immunize you.
[4:47:48] to make sure you are a soldier of that
[4:47:51] level.
[4:47:53] Amen.
[4:47:56] &gt;&gt; This church,
[4:47:57] &gt;&gt; brother
[4:48:01] was measured up to this church level of
[4:48:03] this church
[4:48:10] and he never failed.
[4:48:18] God when he calls you
[4:48:22] I I like those brothers uh you know a
[4:48:25] brother has received his pension
[4:48:29] &gt;&gt; and the revelation of the pension how to
[4:48:31] use the pension falls onto another
[4:48:32] brother
[4:48:38] say brother that patient of yours let's
[4:48:40] use it this way
[4:48:44] Tell him if God gave you me the patient,
[4:48:49] &gt;&gt; he should give me the leation to how to
[4:48:51] use the patient. Me,
[4:48:56] not to you.
[4:49:04] That's easy. Oh, don't worry. It's
[4:49:08] medical ter. It's fine. Okay.
[4:49:14] How do you have a revelation
[4:49:20] of a thing which doesn't belong to you?
[4:49:27] Every one of us, whatever we're going
[4:49:29] through,
[4:49:31] God gives us a revelation
[4:49:34] equal to what we are going through.
[4:49:40] this church,
[4:49:41] &gt;&gt; God has has has given you a a test here.
[4:49:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[4:49:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. We are now going to battle.
[4:49:56] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God is very wonderful.
[4:50:00] He told
[4:50:02] you 32,000 people,000
[4:50:08] Tell them.
[4:50:10] &gt;&gt; So they Gideon came up
[4:50:15] gentlemen,
[4:50:17] anybody who's got a new wife
[4:50:20] doesn't need to die in the battle,
[4:50:24] he can go back.
[4:50:27] Those that means those of us who have
[4:50:28] got old wives who need to die.
[4:50:31] Those those with new wives shouldn't
[4:50:33] die.
[4:50:40] So those with new wives went.
[4:50:46] He said he comes again.
[4:50:51] Gentlemen,
[4:50:53] if you have bought a new garden,
[4:50:59] please
[4:51:01] go back.
[4:51:04] People going back.
[4:51:06] That means those of us who have not good
[4:51:07] garden can die
[4:51:13] and when they were going they were
[4:51:14] saying brother you know
[4:51:18] I just bought that new garden in
[4:51:22] I don't know what how God works like
[4:51:28] God says no it's it's it's it's a uh
[4:51:32] there are too many
[4:51:36] Tell them
[4:51:38] to drink water.
[4:51:40] &gt;&gt; 32,000 people
[4:51:43] &gt;&gt; felt thirst at the same time
[4:51:49] and immediately there was a liver to
[4:51:51] drink from
[4:51:56] the 2,000 people feeling thirsty at the
[4:51:59] same time. The water is there.
[4:52:06] So he tells them
[4:52:09] &gt;&gt; go and drink.
[4:52:15] They went there. The majority of them
[4:52:17] were
[4:52:20] some were laughing.
[4:52:23] So he says those of you who kneel down
[4:52:27] go this way.
[4:52:30] So a lot of the big group went to that
[4:52:32] side.
[4:52:33] And a few people went to the lapping
[4:52:35] site.
[4:52:39] So the lapping site maybe the the kneing
[4:52:41] side was was shouting at the gro
[4:52:48] the rappers.
[4:52:51] You drink like a dog.
[4:52:58] &gt;&gt; They heard the announcement.
[4:53:02] says,
[4:53:05] "Those of you who knew
[4:53:08] go home,
[4:53:11] &gt;&gt; and only 300 remain."

[4:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[4:53:46] because if I can say myself my own name
[4:53:49] actually no

[4:54:53] if you want to see what God can do,
[4:54:56] on the moral.
[4:54:58] Go and stand where the Lord stood.

[4:57:16] &gt;&gt; He was reading a songs.
[4:57:19] When machines attached to him,
[4:57:24] &gt;&gt; what is he doing now?
[4:57:27] &gt;&gt; He's singing.
[4:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[4:57:33] &gt;&gt; You just change dwelling places.
[4:57:39] &gt;&gt; Read for me, my brother.
[4:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:57:41] &gt;&gt; Read for me.
[4:57:41] &gt;&gt; And if you can, okay, which way?
[4:57:46] If you wouldn't change one bit,
[4:57:49] you you you wouldn't change. Okay. It
[4:57:52] wouldn't change you one bit to die. Just
[4:57:57] your dwelling place.
[4:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:58:03] [applause]
[4:58:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change you.
[4:58:10] &gt;&gt; Death doesn't change you.
[4:58:13] What changes
[4:58:16] your dwelling place?
[4:58:19] So, brother
[4:58:23] is as he is,
[4:58:28] a little bit younger.
[4:58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:58:35] Yes, sir.
[4:58:36] &gt;&gt; He is the same.
[4:58:45] He is the same
[4:58:49] only that now he's around 25.
[4:58:54] All the bending, all the gone.
[4:59:03] disease can't have a power over him
[4:59:05] anymore
[4:59:08] because when Moses and Elijah appeared
[4:59:13] in the book of revelation
[4:59:15] when they came they had the same
[4:59:18] qualities of life which they had before
[4:59:20] they came
[4:59:24] because
[4:59:26] even if you are dead for thousands of
[4:59:28] years
[4:59:31] When you come back, you come back to be
[4:59:34] the same being you left.
[4:59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:59:40] &gt;&gt; So death just changes our dwelling
[4:59:43] place.
[4:59:50] Death doesn't change your nature.
[4:59:55] Doesn't change your faith.
[4:59:59] doesn't change nothing
[5:00:03] in you
[5:00:04] &gt;&gt; but your dwelling place
[5:00:07] &gt;&gt; lead for them my brother as we are
[5:00:09] closing
[5:00:09] &gt;&gt; death does doesn't do nothing to a man
[5:00:14] but change his dwelling place doesn't
[5:00:16] change your nature doesn't change your
[5:00:19] faith doesn't change nothing in you but
[5:00:22] your dwelling place amen [applause]
[5:00:28] Death
[5:00:29] &gt;&gt; for us is a changing of rooms.
[5:00:36] Amen. Amen.
[5:00:37] &gt;&gt; For you and me, change, it's just
[5:00:40] changing of the dwelling place.

[5:16:45] to be standing here this morning
[5:16:50] as a witness
[5:16:54] to witness a life
[5:16:58] that was well lived.
[5:17:01] Amen.
[5:17:02] It's everyone's prerogative, oh God,
[5:17:07] to call a
[5:17:12] their father.
[5:17:15] Hence I'm saying also father
[5:17:19] my father my father
[5:17:23] the chariot of Israel
[5:17:27] and the horse men thereof.
[5:17:32] He used this tightly
[5:17:36] several times.
[5:17:40] He emphasized
[5:17:44] that Alicia
[5:17:47] put much emphasis
[5:17:52] on the horsemen.
[5:17:56] Father,
[5:17:59] we bow down our heads
[5:18:02] in reverence and in respect,
[5:18:08] thinking of Father, you
[5:18:12] before the foundation of the world,
[5:18:16] you chose a man.
[5:18:20] His parents named him Jacob.
[5:18:25] But before the foundation of the world,
[5:18:29] we had never named him Jacob.
[5:18:33] He used the name Jacob
[5:18:37] until a certain time
[5:18:40] until that name was changed
[5:18:44] and the ministry changed.
[5:18:47] Father, we are witnesses
[5:18:50] of the changing of that ministry.
[5:18:53] We bless your name, our God,
[5:18:57] the greatest expositor
[5:19:00] of the seventh seal.
[5:19:03] Father, we thank you so much.
[5:19:07] Ever since we heard this said news,
[5:19:11] Father, our hearts sank.
[5:19:14] But when your word is being preached,
[5:19:17] it elevates us
[5:19:20] to greater heights
[5:19:23] to deeper
[5:19:25] revelations [snorts]
[5:19:27] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[5:19:29] Christ.
[5:19:31] We bless your name.
[5:19:34] It's been a long week.
[5:19:37] The family is stressed.
[5:19:40] the family and relatives, the church as
[5:19:43] a whole.
[5:19:45] They are very much tired. Oh God,
[5:19:48] thank you for being with them.
[5:19:52] Thank you for carrying them, Father, on
[5:19:54] your shoulders.
[5:19:57] Thank you so much, Father.
[5:20:00] As in a few hours,
[5:20:03] Father, we will be receiving the body,
[5:20:07] an old body,
[5:20:10] a tired body,
[5:20:13] &gt;&gt; but Father,
[5:20:16] Pastor Edra has rightfully ended with a
[5:20:19] nice quotation.
[5:20:22] Father,
[5:20:24] that old cakus
[5:20:26] is done away with
[5:20:29] the body
[5:20:31] that he is in
[5:20:34] is a young body,
[5:20:37] a body full of eternal vigor,
[5:20:41] eternal energy.
[5:20:44] We give you glory and grace.
[5:20:47] Oh father
[5:20:49] be with the family
[5:20:52] father as they are going to endeavor as
[5:20:55] they're going to encounter
[5:20:58] father the the life challenges facing
[5:21:01] them
[5:21:03] embrace them father may you never depart
[5:21:08] help father mamelo tabernet
[5:21:11] the ministering brethren
[5:21:14] the board
[5:21:16] Father,
[5:21:18] may not the departure
[5:21:20] of our loving pastor
[5:21:24] be the demise of the church.
[5:21:27] Father Alicia followed Elijah
[5:21:31] until he received
[5:21:34] a double portion.
[5:21:37] Father,
[5:21:39] what a nice quotation.
[5:21:41] What is our measure?
[5:21:44] Father, you never made the mentally,
[5:21:48] Father. To fit Alicia,
[5:21:51] oh God, but you made it Alicia
[5:21:55] to fit in the mentally.
[5:21:57] &gt;&gt; That is our measure.
[5:22:00] We bless your name, our father.
[5:22:03] Bless all the organizers,
[5:22:06] Father. Everybody who has contributed
[5:22:10] physically, spiritually, some with their
[5:22:13] money, some with their time,
[5:22:16] Father, some they've missed their place
[5:22:19] of work just to be with the family. May
[5:22:23] you pour your blessings, oh God, we ask
[5:22:26] these things, receiving them by faith in
[5:22:31] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[5:22:33] Jesus Christ. Amen and amen.
[5:22:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[5:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we come to the end of the
[5:22:43] program,
[5:22:46] Brother will come
[5:22:49] and I appreciate your patience.
[5:22:54] I think we had a downtime where we lost
[5:22:56] more almost an hour.
[5:23:01] But you were patient.
[5:23:04] And I want you to give yourselves a
[5:23:06] round.
[5:23:10] [music]
[5:23:11] &gt;&gt; I think before our brother comes,
[5:23:14] we spoke about pastor.
[5:23:18] All the speakers spoke very well.
[5:23:23] But I want sister Margaret
[5:23:30] &gt;&gt; just to stand to her feet.
[5:23:33] Brother Jlo,
[5:23:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Jlo,
[5:23:35] &gt;&gt; Sister Sheron,
[5:23:36] &gt;&gt; Sister Sheron,
[5:23:37] &gt;&gt; Sister Dodo,
[5:23:38] &gt;&gt; Sister Dodo,
[5:23:39] &gt;&gt; Aquila,
[5:23:40] &gt;&gt; Aquila,
[5:23:41] &gt;&gt; the grandchildren.
[5:23:43] &gt;&gt; I want us to give them a round of
[5:23:45] applause.
[5:23:50] If the family can stand,
[5:23:53] they gave us the pastor for 50 years
[5:23:59] &gt;&gt; and we want to appreciate you as a
[5:24:01] family.
[5:24:04] Uh there's many times where he could
[5:24:05] have spent time with you,
[5:24:10] but he was on the road.
[5:24:13] you were patient with the church
[5:24:17] and then but we really appreciate you. I
[5:24:20] think another round of applause.
[5:24:24] &gt;&gt; God [music] bless you.
[5:24:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother
[5:24:29] and then to the M assembly
[5:24:33] we say stay united.
