I came and there was a wedding. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for our children. Um, you can convince a lot of people that you're a believer. &gt;&gt; The most difficult people to convince that you are a believer are your own children because they see when you are low, they see when you are high.

What can separate from us from the love of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; So we have to come to the word. &gt;&gt; Uh you need to stand for a long time because you're going to sit for a long time. So let's start from John 12 verse 20. 12 verse 20. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, are you there, my brother?

Open our eyes of understanding that we might understand the scriptures in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we can be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um I in this church I got so many of my own families here.

All &gt;&gt; young people who are born message. This is the example. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank you for fulfilling the word. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh you know when we were starting the message uh beautiful people didn't want to come to the message so God has made our children to be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God has given us the duty himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we got very beautiful people wearing very well not exposing themselves with all the majesty the word of pastor being manifested because the way you are seeing our sister there that's what preaches being manifested. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we thank God for that because uh when they refused, they died in the desert. &gt;&gt; But their children entered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because their children, they they only knew Moses. They never knew Pharaoh. They only knew Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Those of you who have been uh born in the message. You are a blessed generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So today uh oh I saw it wasn't announced but yesterday I saw like uh sister Gloria from Botswana. I saw her yesterday. [Music] Is she here now? Oh God bless you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you still in Nairobi or you are now here? You are you're in Botswana. You're not here. You should just transfer and be here. Amen. We're in Botswana now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Take our greetings to the saints there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just imagine people born in the message are now grayhaired. I'm wondering what's getting late my brother. You're becoming bigger now. &gt;&gt; You're married. God bless you. So I can dismiss you for the time being. &gt;&gt; We'll come later on. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So today we are starting from a new sin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at this scripture. &gt;&gt; Can I have the scripture back? John 12 verse 20. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible is very very specific book. Very specific specific. And uh what you need to do just have a friend who can introduce to you how to read the scriptures and then from there you take over. I never read the scriptures the way I'm reading now. I met pastor and a few others of my friends who are in message showing me how to get the scriptures correct and here it is and there were Greeks now these are Greeks for you to understand what it is it's because maybe you haven't heard this but this is like These were Greeks. But verse 21 says they came to Philillip and Philip of Beth of Galilee. So that means Philip was a galon. When they say you a Galilean that means you are a less knowledgeable person. What? What you you are just like for you're from the village. &gt;&gt; Because go to the book of acts. You hear the people were saying these people are galians. Why are they speaking English? Why are they speaking Greek? A was supposed to know any language. &gt;&gt; They were only supposed to know Galian because they were Galians. So these were Greeks. The Greeks at that time were the most knowledgeable people. Hallelujah. Amen. Now the Galidians they came to ask no the Greeks &gt;&gt; the people who were educated &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; it's like uh maybe oh no those of you from don't get don't get offense it's like um a person from trying to teach somebody from Pritoria or Johansburg That's what is here. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible &gt;&gt; put it open. They came to Philip who was a Galilean saying we would want to see Jesus. So if you want to see Jesus, don't go for this modded preaches. &gt;&gt; Ask a Gonal [Applause] until you put special effects in the church. For what? &gt;&gt; You are bringing Hollywood in the church. &gt;&gt; We are not supposed to attract you with anything in this message except the word of the hour. [Applause] And my brother, my sister, there's no one who can worship God better than a a a man from Switzerland. Unfortunately, they were they they were tricked in Switzerland. &gt;&gt; Sorry, &gt;&gt; in Swandland they were tricked &gt;&gt; because instead of worshiping God, they worship a man. [Music] You were supposed to do that for God. Please [Applause] &gt;&gt; do the same for God. from the beginning. How he opened the eyes of Adam. How he opened the Red Sea. How he opened the mighty Jordan. How he was there on Mount H. How he took down Golth you were there on Mount Sunset. You were there in Canyon. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are supposed to talk all the good things which God has done for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. So the Greeks came to a less knowledgeable person would see Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, you can give me the 6 6304 0604. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 33. So the Greeks were the people of that time, the highly educated men living in the world of arts. These Greeks were people who were converted to the Jewish religion and they were also waiting for the coming of the Messiah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there was no doubt. Yes. There my brother that the same one the 33 that one that there that. So they came for the feast. So now the Greeks were very high level talented people. They were leading the world of art. They were highly educated, great people. They were great scholars. They read many books. But there is something in a man's heart, that great thirst &gt;&gt; that comes to the human heart. &gt;&gt; They knew they needed eternal life. &gt;&gt; Philip took them &gt;&gt; to Jesus. When they found Jesus, &gt;&gt; oh, they were so disappointed &gt;&gt; because they saw a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why those of you who are friends of mine who are together in the Catholic church, when they give you a picture of Jesus, they put a heart there coming out because they don't want him to be a man. They want him to be something. They don't want him to be a man. They want something, something a little bit more added up to be their knowledge of God. But God, God, doesn't work that way. Because if I came here and my eyes are there stars coming out my my mouth things coming out you people don't doesn't need to be believers to believe the word because you'll be believing the special effects. That's why you see uh some of our prophets, some of them are riding in the air, some of them are doing what? &gt;&gt; Those things are not for believers. &gt;&gt; You can come to Malawi. You can you can hire somebody to send a whirlwind somewhere. Those of can tell you there's a real wind for That doesn't take God. &gt;&gt; The prophet was in Germany. People were sending wind to him in the name of the father or the son. Special effects are not for. &gt;&gt; So 34 the next verse. Then when a man and then a man try to satisfy this thirst want this part this is a thirst for God. You can take anything to replace God. You will find that you are still empty. You can take drugs. You can take alcohol, you can women, you can take what? You can take money. It will never suffice. I don't know about your country but in Malawi the people who are big thieves are the people who are rich. So you'll be wondering he has money but he steals money all the big deals which are very much billion dollar deals are done by people got billions until one day I would want to ask them you had three billion and you have sold four billion what are you going to do with it? No, I just want to have it &gt;&gt; because as long as it's not filled up with God space, if it's not filled with God, you will still feel empty. [Music] So that's why the Greeks with all their knowledge, all their education, &gt;&gt; they they still wanted to see Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are supposed to see Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem with many of us even in here we can talk about Jesus of the past how Jesus worked with Paul worked with Matthew until today. We are very good experts to say how Jesus worked with brother Brham. But unfortunately here we are. How many here can raise up their hands. They were alive when brother was here. No one. No. There are few of us who are here. Uh the preacher was not alive. Maybe brother was was there must have been there in 1960s. Amen. &gt;&gt; But for me, brother came and went before I was born and I'm not young. So I cannot be talking about Jesus of brother Brana. &gt;&gt; I want my Jesus of today. I would want to see Jesus today. &gt;&gt; I don't want the historical Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So where is this Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First John 1 verse one. &gt;&gt; John 1 John 1 verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Brham was on the mountain. Brother or brother stop. So that was 60 years ago. &gt;&gt; That's 60 years ago. &gt;&gt; 60 years. &gt;&gt; That's in history. &gt;&gt; Amen. That which was in the beginning, we have heard, we have seen our eyes, which we looked upon, our hands have handled the word of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our hands. &gt;&gt; Is it talking about John? He talking about who our hands have handled the word of life too my brother for a life was manifested to us. A life was manifested to us. We have seen it and we bear witness. And I am standing here to show unto you that eternal life &gt;&gt; which was manifested unto us. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says tell tell this to your children. Your children should tell your children. Their children should tell their children. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what I a life was manifested to us. &gt;&gt; Whose life was manifested to me of brother Brham? No, I didn't see brother. &gt;&gt; The one who came to me was in Amen. Amen. A life was manifested to me. Now I need to manifest the same life to you. So don't look at look at me because what was in now is incodima [Applause] doesn't beat his wife. I don't beat my wife. You shouldn't beat your wife. It comes from one to another to another. So it is coming from our fathers to us. Now we are living to our children. It's a cycle which is not supposed to be broken. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I preach something else which I've never seen been manifested to me then I'm wrong because these things is about apprentichip in the past the message for 1,500 years &gt;&gt; there was no Bible it was about people seeing Peter and the one who sees Peter, tells the people what he saw Peter doing, he goes, the other one comes, tells the people how Peter was doing. He goes, the other one comes. That's how the message is about for us to tell our children. We have to manifest these things, my brother. We have to manifest grace. Life has been manifested to us. We have to live the exactly what was manifested to us for the message of power not to lose its power. [Applause] Amen. Amen. God will give us pastors after our his heart to show us to manifest to us &gt;&gt; the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Three, my brother. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Verse three. &gt;&gt; Yes. Verse three. That which we have seen and heard, &gt;&gt; declare we unto you. You see there we see how it is being done. Then we declare to you so you also might have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with the father son Jesus Christ. So today if I a preacher here I should come before you before you church and tell you who can bring me of sin. &gt;&gt; Hey listen I'm not saying who can No, &gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt; the the the the student. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you must say I know. Yeah. Because that thing &gt;&gt; is supposed to be continuously going. Now it is on brother after brother Ja then it goes to Si and from there there will be somebody else coming again should continue it's a continuum God shall never be without a witness so somebody should come and say a sin on me not me you You should go there in M west or east or south and stand among your neighbors who can blame me of sin. I'm not talking about me only. I'm talking about you. It's you &gt;&gt; because if a seed abides alone, &gt;&gt; it will never. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we every time in the past go people wanted to see God. &gt;&gt; Uh most of the lies which you hear are happening in the world there. It's people trying to make God as if he's somewhere very far. So if you want to approach God, then you have to ask them to approach God for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you yourself &gt;&gt; must see Jesus. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to see Jesus, &gt;&gt; ask Philip &gt;&gt; the he will take you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day the Israelites wanted to see Jesus wanted to see God. &gt;&gt; So God came. &gt;&gt; Exodus 19, brother. Exodus 19. Exodus 19, my brother. Exodus 19:8. &gt;&gt; 19:8. Exodus chapter 19 verse 18. Yes. And Mount Sai was altogether on smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire. And the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. &gt;&gt; Amen. 20 And the Lord came down upon the mount upon Mount Si on on the top of the mount and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount and Moses went up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can see here people wanted to see God. God came, little God, the father himself came and it was thunderlings, &gt;&gt; it was fire, &gt;&gt; it was smoke and the earth was shaking. I'm telling my brother, if there was a this building starts shaking, I don't know how many of you will remain in here, but I'll be one of the first ones to go out. The earthquake with the quaking of the earth, &gt;&gt; the thunderings, the lightning, the people moved a far, but Moses went up and the people came back to Moses on verse Uh uh Exodus 20, &gt;&gt; Exodus 20, &gt;&gt; verse 18, &gt;&gt; verse 18. &gt;&gt; And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking. And when the people saw it, they removed and stood a &gt;&gt; What? What? What happened? When the earth was quaking, when the thunderings were there, when the lightning was there, everybody moved a Moses went up the mountain. &gt;&gt; 19 And they said unto Moses, "Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with us, lest we die." And this is where we are now. We need a man to be speaking to us. We don't see don't see God. We don't want God to speak to us anymore. If God is going to speak to us today, he will speak to us through a man. If you want to see Jesus today, we will see. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So one day Zakius wanted to see Jesus &gt;&gt; he was a sinner. He was short. He came short. So he said let me hide in a tree. Now, brother Abraham says &gt;&gt; that revelation of going into a tree made Zakius &gt;&gt; to look down upon Jesus. That's what says the shortest man look down upon Jesus. No wonder today &gt;&gt; when Jesus is in a man look people look down upon him &gt;&gt; even the short ones as well I don't say short in terms of size the short is in the spiritual shortness So when Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Zakius, &gt;&gt; come down." You know, Jesus didn't even look up. He He just say, "Zakius, come down." The people said, "Where is Zakius?" They saw him coming down. How did he see him? God knows where you are. [Music] You can try to hide. He know it doesn't even need to be. Come here. &gt;&gt; I know you know that you are a sinner. &gt;&gt; I know you know you not have come short. I want to go to your house. How can how can how can if he's God, how can he go to this man's house? We know this man is a sinner. A little sinner. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus loves the sinners. &gt;&gt; He goes to their houses because they a well man doesn't need a physician. It is a man who is sick who needs a physician. So Jesus &gt;&gt; granted the desire of Zakius because Zakius had a desire &gt;&gt; to see him. My brother, can you have a desire to see Jesus? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. One day there was a bl a blind man somewhere in uh this is my brother 50 01 0 0 disases and afflictions diseases and affliction 50. &gt;&gt; This is a man who was uh who was blind &gt;&gt; and uh he he his mother was a very saintly old woman. So one day, brother Bham was in Arkansas. His mother came to him in a dream after he had already passed away. You see you mothers, can you be spiritual so that you can come back back to us in a dream? Good dreams. Don't chase us with pangas when you die. You people angry until you are so fiery until when we dream about you chasing us with pangas. Let's see how this man his mommy come back to him. [Music] You you you can read about it at the beginning there. He said he saw his mother living a saintly life. Amen. Are you there my brother? Uh 501 Z and applications paragraph 145. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 145. Amen. So this mother lived a life before his child. She never told him a lie. She had been dead for 10 years. That's there it is. Person actually was moving in Arkansas. By that time there was segregation. So the black people would stand on one side. white people standing walking on the other side. So one day brother heard somebody crying mercy me. So he turned to see this man and his wife. The brothers who were with him told him, "Brother, brother, don't go there. Those are blacks. It will cause a riot." Rabb told the brothers, "I can never do that." So he went over &gt;&gt; to this man who was blind and the man he said person he said my old mommy was a good religious woman. She never told me a lie all her life. She had been dead for 10 years now. I never had you in all my life. He never heard about I live about 100 miles from here. Last night I've been blind for many years. Last night I woke up standing beside my bed, stood my old mommy and she said, "Honey, &gt;&gt; child, go to Elorado, Arkansas and ask for somebody by the name Bran. The Lord has given a gift of divine healing. You shall receive your sight. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel like my heart would get big. I see God speaking. Hallelujah. Amen. This woman lived a sentry life before his her children. Sisters, let's live a sentry life before our children. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this man that day &gt;&gt; received his sight. Who told him? &gt;&gt; His mother &gt;&gt; who had been died &gt;&gt; for so many years. &gt;&gt; Where did he find Jesus in? &gt;&gt; In a man. He told him the mother said there's a man his name &gt;&gt; is Branham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a man, a woman, &gt;&gt; a saintly woman is very very important in our midst. Especially if they rest in peace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you dream of your mothers beating you because that's the way they left you. They left you. But a good woman would do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You meet a man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you go to the um it's already passed off. Okay, that's fine. Now &gt;&gt; just believe me. I'm a friend to pastor. I wouldn't tell you anything wrong. But it's for you to be searching these scriptures. So let me not read again so that I'm on I've got 35 slides but I'm on 11 so I need to finish. I need to finish. So let me just speak. You read later on. So there was a man on the pool of besides this man was at the pool for 38 years. 38 38 years. 38 years. &gt;&gt; Those of you who are not 38, a man had been sitting on a pool for 38 years. 38. Nobody felt for him. My brother, &gt;&gt; when you are poor, &gt;&gt; all your relatives run away. Ask anybody who is poor here. I just when last did the their relatives come to their house? Those who actually chase the out the villagers from their home. &gt;&gt; You know this man, &gt;&gt; it was very easy. The pool was like the way it is here. So he was paralyzed. &gt;&gt; So when the angel disturbs the water, it was very simple. Take him, &gt;&gt; put him in the water and take him out and he will be well. No man do that for every time. When you are in trouble, my brother, you suffer alone. You know if you are using a battered car even the people asking for a lift they don't want to go into your car they want a better car to get a lift in just imagine they don't even have a car when they looking for a lift they want a better car that's the problem with people they only good only good at you in good times. People are only good to you when good times going bad times. &gt;&gt; So one day they found him. They say it was a it was a Sabbath. &gt;&gt; So they found him. He's carrying his m. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You didn't want to celebrate with him. That's the problem with your people. Your friend has been walking for many years. He comes with a car, you want to criticize him instead of celebrating with him. So he was carrying he was celebrating Do you know the first thing I said to him? Why are you carrying a mat? Why are you carrying a mat? Instead of asking him, how did you walk? &gt;&gt; He told him the man who told me to walk is the one who told me to carry the mat. &gt;&gt; So you want me to listen only to the walking and not carry the mat? The man who told me to walk told me to carry the mu he is wrong because today Sabbath no man who told me to walk told me to carry the [Applause] They kept asking him questions &gt;&gt; and he asked them, "You're asking me too many questions. Do you want also to become his disciples? You're asking me too many questions about Do you want also to be his disciple? He was asking them all these questions. Oh, how is the pastor? How is this? How is that? He wants us to be his disciples. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man who told me to carry my to to walk Brother, he was lying there for 38 years. &gt;&gt; The water was being disturbed. There were go and read the Bible say there were many people at that at that pool. But nobody felt for him. [Music] Everybody for himself. It was a South Africa my friend. It was South Africa. &gt;&gt; Everybody for himself. Is it like that here? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Everybody for himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh in Malawi there &gt;&gt; when they when when they want to the presidency they say we we are suffering we are we are this as soon as they go into the chair the only people who benefits &gt;&gt; it's him and his concubines and his children but when they want our finger they want they say We Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So my brother, when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; everything changed &gt;&gt; because a man came and this man he didn't even know that this was Jesus. And they asked him, "What is the name of the man who has healed you?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know." So until one day he met him again and that's when he he knew his name that's only the time which he but the day he was healed he never even knew the name of Jesus what is new a man a man &gt;&gt; a man So we can come to Auntie Jamaima who came to her a man she didn't know his name. No but when she was praying she said I am theite woman. Where is my Elijah? How the Elijah came? She didn't care about that because your prayer is not supposed to be guided by your own thoughts. Your prayer should be a deep prayer. &gt;&gt; God bless you. My brother yesterday he said, "I found my wife in the deepest of sleep." Sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, can you stop this lapid eye movement prayers? There's so much rapid eye movement prayers. That is why all the time you find that you you are doing things which are not correct because your prayers are not deep enough. Your prayer should be deep enough until God can cut off your leg. God can cut off your hand without you knowing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when brother came, &gt;&gt; he was he was moving from somewhere to somewhere. &gt;&gt; The aeroplane landed in Memphis. Today I'm lucky the theical engineer is there. He's standing actually on top of the table there. You can ask him, "How much water do you need to be in the air to give a plane a frames out? &gt;&gt; An airplane can move in water, &gt;&gt; but if the water is too much, &gt;&gt; the engineer will tell you it will be a frames out." So frame out that means the airplane's engine are not firing anymore. [Music] That has to be a lot of water in the skies there. But God did that because Jeremiah was praying &gt;&gt; and the water barrier in the sky was so big. It was so high the plane couldn't go over it. Most of these small small storms &gt;&gt; the just flies above them. small small storms the prayer just flies around them but this one's prayer &gt;&gt; was for big so high your prayer my brother my sister &gt;&gt; can create such a big barrier Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. If we want to see Jesus, let's forget about who is around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The biggest enemy you ever have &gt;&gt; is this one. Oh, &gt;&gt; my brother. Your biggest enemy. &gt;&gt; Where is he? &gt;&gt; This one. &gt;&gt; You don't have a bigger enemy than this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one we need to defeat, &gt;&gt; it's this one. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, one day It will bust wide open &gt;&gt; and I'll go far beyond the skies. &gt;&gt; When you are looking for your enemies, don't look outside, look inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has got his own GPS. If if you if you really remember very very if you can remember very very well go and check all descendants you find brother Brham the first things you tell you is where you are coming from your house number and your name. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go and ask them, "Who am I?" Doesn't know me. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. He even knows where I stay. &gt;&gt; Because if God want to visit me, he will come to my house. [Music] Don't start bothering people who are living in Porsche areas to be in their houses. Be in your house. God will find you there. You know, people who live in big houses are very mean. Somebody has got a house which has got eight bedrooms, but he lives there with his wife. I don't know what they do with the other bedrooms, but I don't know. But my brother, &gt;&gt; God can come to your ty house. He cannot go to the openheimers. He doesn't like it. &gt;&gt; It's just rugs to him. That open house is nothing to God. &gt;&gt; Your house is very important to him. &gt;&gt; He will find you there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know you are more you are more satisfied with than themh. [Music] [Applause] You can sleep and snow as much as you can in your small house. They don't sleep in those houses. He knows your name. He knows where dwelling. &gt;&gt; You remember there was a boy who was eating laba. &gt;&gt; So when he was eating laba, They tested him. They found that in his bones he was lacking suffer. Something was just drawing him. Why? because something inside him sto that I don't know uh do you have young women who eat soil here it happens a lot &gt;&gt; ah okay okay that good I'll tell you the reason &gt;&gt; yeah so um due to women being women their bodies run out of iron. So their nose it tells them the iron is in the soil. That's why they go and buy soil they when they soil they better because that ailment inside them lack of iron inside them is calling for ion. Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Inside you something is calling for eternal life and we are smelling where the eternal life is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've come all the Malawi. &gt;&gt; I've passed so many churches. I've smelled something here. &gt;&gt; Something is here which I miss eternal life. &gt;&gt; It is here. That is why I am here. Otherwise, you know, a lot of South African people, they go to Malawi to find the prophets in Malawi. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. People go to find prophets. We have our own prophets in my big ones. &gt;&gt; I've left those ones because something is cooking here. I smell the way the soil is tasting. My brother cannot eat soil by by any means. I can but these girls they eat soil because something inside them is calling. So if there's eternal life that's why I'm fastesting for it. That means it is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the boy was eating laba because something inside him was calling for that. So his nose was telling them he was not eating metals. He was eating exactly what the bones were telling him. that he lacked. &gt;&gt; You eat what you lack. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day Job said, "My redeemer liveth." One day in the this very same morning, I shall see my redeemer. It was thousands and thousands of years before the redeemer came. But I'm telling you to my brother, my sister, one day the redeemer came. One day the redeemer is coming. Hallelujah. Oh my brother. He has made us priests and kings. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are kings. We are priests. Remember the priesthood and the kingship. were separated in Jacob because when it came to Jacob, the scepter went with Judah and the the priesthood went with Levi. &gt;&gt; But in Jesus we are coming back. Amen. To the priesthood and kingship. So the priesthood in me should be able to intercede for others. The best of of the best we can do for one another. My brother, if you got nothing to say about me, pray for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People have blamed me for things which I didn't do. &gt;&gt; But you know, people have blamed me for looking black like this. What should I do? &gt;&gt; No. Tell me. What should I do? I should start swallowing. &gt;&gt; Who wanted me to be black? &gt;&gt; As black as and beautiful the way I am. Amen. I &gt;&gt; I I thought I was very beautiful until one day my sister told me says, "No, no, no, you're not." That was the first time which I realized that I wasn't that beautiful. They told me you are so black. She didn't want to hide anything. She was very straightforward, very honest. and honest. &gt;&gt; Even your nose are so wide open. &gt;&gt; I I don't know what to do for you. &gt;&gt; You know people can blame you for things which you are not. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God &gt;&gt; has made us &gt;&gt; my brother. Can you go to the revelation again?

He &gt;&gt; who has brought you here. &gt;&gt; He &gt;&gt; it is his making. &gt;&gt; Salvation is his doing. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord. All of grace. He redeemed us for a purpose. My brother have use for me. But God has got use for me purposely. Purposely he brought me into this message. God does not do things without a purpose. We are kings, &gt;&gt; spiritual kings. more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne. But now today we are spiritual kings. We reign over the spiritual kingdom. We are learning on his spiritual kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. There my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

But you are the spiritual kings. &gt;&gt; You are the priests. &gt;&gt; What does the priest do? &gt;&gt; He intercedes. &gt;&gt; You are supposed to intercede for me. You're not supposed to be my prosecutor. [Music] A lot of you here are prosecutors. But you choose. He you remember 2014 he did this 2014 he did this kind actually even even if you go to his WhatsApp the messages which he deleted we can bring them back to see whether he whether he seen last week brother when I pray I pray for today. &gt;&gt; Now, forgive me today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our sins are forgiven every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, my brother, if you haven't repented of your sin, which you did 1997, please repent now. Because this is now we want to see Jesus of today. Where is he? The word of life is with us. That means life &gt;&gt; is with us. That is why today our children who are here can go to our university and come back without committing ad because the life is back. Amen. They can go come back without smoking ganja because we have declared to them. &gt;&gt; We have declared to them remember you declare what you have. [Music] I can't declare to you what I don't have. If I have hatred, I'll declare hatred. &gt;&gt; If I got fear, I'll declare fear. If I got love, &gt;&gt; I'll declare love because in me there's nothing rather than h that what I have. If you have happiness, even your children will know that you are very happy person. angry people that uh when they speak you are mama but when say but by the time saying uh you tell your child you're You stop people with stop. I had one of my sisters when she wants you to say something to you. every time she's pulling you here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I know that anger was just because she was angry against herself. &gt;&gt; You know when you are a thief, &gt;&gt; the first person you steal from is yourself. &gt;&gt; So when when you a thief, &gt;&gt; the first person you steal from is yourself. If you're a fifth, the first person which you steal from is yourself. By the time you're stealing from other people, you have. [Music] &gt;&gt; So what we have heard, &gt;&gt; we declare unto you. So we have that stages where it passes from one individual to another to another another because this stone has come to demolish the devil's kingdom. My brother, my sister, there's no better way to demolish the kingdom of the devil than to tell our children to live right. this business because we're walking in the light. When you walk in the right, &gt;&gt; you become the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can go away from earth for about a billion miles, the earth will be lying in the in the in in the sunlight and you see you see the earth as a star and the way you go very far from it, the more you tend to wonder why people divided the earth into South Africa. Zimbabwe. So you can tell your friend you know and that star there the people they've divided themselves and the others areas are zulus. Oh, there at the moment there the brundies are fighting the two somewhere there as as you're going far the problems of earth become very small for you until you tend to wonder why are they doing that? It's a small place. &gt;&gt; As much as you go higher, &gt;&gt; the problem of the earth becomes smaller. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um sorry brothers you forgive us. Those of us who are educated we want to talk something else. So you forgive us. Those of us who are educated we want to talk theorem. A² + b²= c². Did some of you hear that? &gt;&gt; I'm from Malawi. Can you shout a square + B²= &gt;&gt; C? &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; You see you, we are speaking the same language. But this is money making yet we speak the same. I am in Malawi. You are here. We speak the same. And we agreed that it's all right. What about the word which is eternal? How much do we need to agree on it? &gt;&gt; And I'm telling the truth, &gt;&gt; it is that one's honest as long as we are on earth. &gt;&gt; Because if you go to the mathematics of God, He doesn't use that one. &gt;&gt; Do you know there was a way from Israel to Egypt which was you could travel only for two days. &gt;&gt; That was the way for man. But God's way passes through the mountains, deep waters, &gt;&gt; dry deserts, snakes, &gt;&gt; bitter waters. They went to where there was the water was bitter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; The way of God passes through all those things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God told Moses, &gt;&gt; tell the people to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God is the same. He is the same because remember the bright morning star the brightest star is also the evening star is the same star. The morning star and the evening star are the same star because he's the same yesterday, today and forever. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The eastern star and the western star is one star. &gt;&gt; They are not two different stars and they don't give their own light. They get light to the original. So you can ask them morning sir. Why are you shining? It will tell you it's not me who is shining. [Music] Morning sir. Why are you pretty? You say no it's not me. I am walking in the sun and the sun is shining upon me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So stars don't have their own light. They reflect light. &gt;&gt; When do when do stars shine the brightest? When it is the darkest. So when it is the darkest, when you are passing the biggest problem, that's when the time to the start to shine the brightest. How does the sun give light? They will tell you the sun has got enough mass &gt;&gt; and has got enough speed. &gt;&gt; That speed creates enough gravitational force upon its core and then from there it blasts off. For those of you who got time, go and look at what the first nuclear bomb looked like. They did put so many guns around and they fired. They fired towards the core so that the can explode. &gt;&gt; They It fired in inwards. &gt;&gt; Fire inwards. Fire at the core until you start giving light. It squeezes itself so hard. It spins so hard about who gave it fuel. That one is not my question because you hear that there are so many dark matter outside there. &gt;&gt; We don't see it but we see the sun because God gave it fuel the Holy Ghost to give light. [Music] But to give light, it has to spin itself. It has to squeeze itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; That squeezing that spinning it squeezes itself to give life. &gt;&gt; When you come to the earth, the earth. That's why the earth is spinning because once the earth stops spinning, it will lose its temperature. It maintains its temperature moving. Don't stop. Move. Move on, brother. you're going to lose your temperature. [Music] &gt;&gt; So the earth keeps on squeezing itself by moving fast &gt;&gt; so that it makes it cold temperature. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; the Bible is there in the skies. The whole skies is just a Bible because God in the beginning wrote everything in the skies. &gt;&gt; So today watch and pray. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. One day, &gt;&gt; one day. &gt;&gt; Mark 4:38, my brother. &gt;&gt; Mark 4:38. &gt;&gt; One day. They were on the sea. &gt;&gt; Are you there, my brother? Oh, he's not here. Okay, I'll read. Yes. And he was in in the hinder part of the ship asleep on the pillow. And they awake him say, "Be careless thou not that we perish." And he allows and rebuked the wind and say, "Peace, be still." And the wind ceased. &gt;&gt; And there was a great calm. Amen. Amen. Amen. Go wake Jesus. No. Go and wake Jesus. Thank you. Where is this Jesus? You're going to wake up. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was with them. &gt;&gt; He was there in the sea in the in the ship. When everything was all right, they forgot Jesus was was asleep. Only when the storms came. Wake up our Lord. Because when there was no problem, they didn't need him. &gt;&gt; They were just dancing. [Music] But when they started rocking, they did the right thing. Because whenever there's a storm, let your Jesus rise up. Go wake him. Brother preach a message. Go wake Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't didn't tell preach the message. Go run away. &gt;&gt; Go wake up Jesus. &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; what did he say? &gt;&gt; Peace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Shalom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Be still. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's what it is. He is &gt;&gt; He's a king of peace. &gt;&gt; 41 41 &gt;&gt; And the people exed and feared. What man of man is this? that even a wind obey him. &gt;&gt; Hey, that man that man is here my brother. &gt;&gt; He is here to come the stormy waters. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stormy waters in our houses. storm waters in our lives. He is here. &gt;&gt; Go wake him up. &gt;&gt; He is within the ship. He's within the vessel. Who is the vessel today? Where's the vessel today? Where's the ship? Here it is. The vessel is here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, &gt;&gt; the tabernac of God &gt;&gt; is here. Revelation 21:3. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's the tabernacle? &gt;&gt; He's with &gt;&gt; and he is there God. &gt;&gt; Which people nos don't worry. They're going to arrest me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is with us. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of God is with us. &gt;&gt; He is dwelling in us. Amen. And we are his people. Are you reading with me? Are you are you reading there? Which people he's talking about us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God himself shall be with them if and be our their God. &gt;&gt; Which people? &gt;&gt; You and me. We are his people. Today if I wanted to tell somebody, somebody wanted to say, "Sir, we would see Jesus, I need to take him to you." &gt;&gt; You are the one. That is why brother Brham &gt;&gt; Brother would say would tell the people all of you stand still be still before he start praying for people. He said everybody stop moving. He wouldn't pray for people until all movement has stopped. Water stands for people. Water stands for people. After the people are still then he would say now I take control of each and every spit in here and after that he will start telling you where do you come from? What is your problem? What is your house number? He knows your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go back to the book uh 643 4. My brother, we finish there now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are coming here to church, don't have too many plans. When you come to church, just come to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you find the preacher can preach for more than two hours. &gt;&gt; Do you have it, my brother? Now 42. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 63604. Bagger 42. I want that one. &gt;&gt; I want to read with the people here. We're going to be reading that one. Amen. We thank God for these young people. They make our lives seem easy is very difficult. Yes. there. Now &gt;&gt; to my text, &gt;&gt; the text which I left to say all this, &gt;&gt; he is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. If men, these men was desirous to see him, God would made a way that their anticipation would be satisfied. If you were desirous, you see God, God will make a way for you to see. Amen. He made a way that they could see him by one of his servants. &gt;&gt; He didn't have four servants to show them Jesus. He told only Philip was enough. to show them Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only one was enough. &gt;&gt; So, and we have the same sincere desire to see him today. If we had, isn't he obligated to show himself among us? &gt;&gt; If you were desirous to see him, if you are the same desire as the Greeks, we see him. Isn't he obligated to show you Jesus today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a great big statement. &gt;&gt; It's there. It's not me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go and check there. It's there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't see it. Where is it? There. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; that's a great big statement. statement. If you were desirous, if you if you came here looking for Jesus, &gt;&gt; he is obligated &gt;&gt; to show you himself. He did to job. He did auntie. He did. He did to a man. The man at the pool was desirous to see a man help him. One day a man came to him. Do you want to walk says yes, but I don't have a man to put me there. Pick up your mat. He didn't. He just rolls up. [Music] &gt;&gt; My brother just lies up and pick your mat. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; One day there was a man who was lucky enough that he had a a mine on the church on the you know in Malaw your position where you earn money as a mineh. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Like we say we allow one person once one one one beggar to be at the door there. He will tell his friends I found a mine. &gt;&gt; Okay. So everybody coming in here will give them whatever small they have &gt;&gt; and they keep the rest to themselves. Not change the rest. You know if a man has got 20 million in his account if he wants to give you money he'll give you 10 money man &gt;&gt; so when we go around in the city in Malawi &gt;&gt; you got you got 100 million in your When you meet a beggar, you don't give him 1 million. &gt;&gt; No, you give him 10. &gt;&gt; Man's help will never help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop looking for help from men. Men are very mean. Their friend is there. He's sick. He's looking for money. They are billionaires. But when they give, sorry, when they give, they give in sense. That's why he was perpetually there. Yeah. In year out in year out if you are looking for help from men my brother you be a slave because you need daily help but one day a man came and God have I none but in the name of Jesus Christ From that day, he never wanted anybody to help him anymore. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't look for help from men. went around the NC campaigning to be president me to be president. &gt;&gt; So when he became president there were about 50 people which he needed to give positions in the government until tells him, "Hey, Mr. President, what type of cabinet is this? What are the use of all those people which you have there?" [Music] Because he was looking for man. &gt;&gt; Man wants when you he helps you, &gt;&gt; you should help him &gt;&gt; back. [Applause] [Music] Be careful of man. Be careful of man. That is why when we're going out of here him would invite a person of his stature to his house so that whenever he is also need his a person of his teacher can invite you know these things we don't invite people who cannot invite you We are people. &gt;&gt; So he was there at the door. Help me. Help me. I'm telling the truth. They were not helping him because if they helped him the next day should have stopped begging. Because when a man came to help him, &gt;&gt; he didn't need to be on the door again the whole of his life. &gt;&gt; So what what type of help was this one? &gt;&gt; That was enslavement. &gt;&gt; So they can punish him with questions. Hey, what what what is the use of deputy minister? &gt;&gt; I know they don't have they don't even have a job description. They don't have but they just have to sit in the cabinet there so that they can also eat from what they helped. man will always be selfish. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; he said, "Walk." That was the end. All your problems are finished. &gt;&gt; You have walked. &gt;&gt; You are independent. You depend upon your own strength given by God. Hey, walk my brother. Walk my brother. Amen. In we go brother sister. This is a moving day. Walk. &gt;&gt; Yes. Walk. &gt;&gt; You've been begging too much. Whoever helps you when you are begging will never help you enough. Let Jesus come. Oh s you just fly. Start flying. &gt;&gt; They asked him. You know whenever something good happens some people celebrate some people don't celebrate. I don't know for whatever reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when something good happens to our brother or sister let's celebrate with them. &gt;&gt; You mean you their friend was sick for 38 years. They couldn't even imagine that he has walked. They should celebrate what what they wanted was to find 408. They should have said where where is the man who has made you walk. We want also to go and see him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that man will only come to those who are looking for him. &gt;&gt; Uh 92 my brother &gt;&gt; 92 the same message 92. Now &gt;&gt; we know &gt;&gt; he only comes &gt;&gt; and identifies himself &gt;&gt; to those who are looking for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't go to those who are not looking for him. My brother, that's the way it will be. At his second coming, the world will know nothing about him. He will just come take his church and be born and those who are not looking for him will be left behind. &gt;&gt; He is only coming to those who are looking for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look for him my brother. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; He is working inside this church. People in this church are becoming eternal.
