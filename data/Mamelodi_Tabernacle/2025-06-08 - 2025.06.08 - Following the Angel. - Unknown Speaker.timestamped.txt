[1:00:26] Mighty God, the songwriter says,
[1:00:30] "When I'm weak, that's when I'm strong."
[1:00:33] We are already in your presence.
[1:00:36] All things are possible, Father.
[1:00:39] Even when Samson was in the dungeon,
[1:00:43] his eyes were blacked out. The prophet
[1:00:45] says Samson knew that there was a
[1:00:48] possibility.
[1:00:50] We come before you this morning already
[1:00:51] in your presence.
[1:00:53] We believe that there is a possibility.
[1:00:55] Father,
[1:00:57] all things are possible to us who
[1:00:59] believe in you.
[1:01:01] I'm already feel so elated. I feel so
[1:01:03] happy to be back home just to be under
[1:01:06] the anointing of the spirit. Father,
[1:01:09] here are the prayer requests of your
[1:01:10] children
[1:01:12] in divers. Father, we pray may please
[1:01:16] come in a special way, Lord Jesus. And
[1:01:19] help them. Some of us not we're not good
[1:01:21] in the body. We not even feeling very

[1:01:34] King Theophan the great Malazerc is here
[1:01:36] this morning. He's going to make
[1:01:38] everything possible.
[1:01:40] Help us to leap into that presence
[1:01:43] where all things are possible. Father,
[1:01:46] your prophet says, Lord, God recommends
[1:01:48] his children. He recommends that his
[1:01:51] children should cry. The only way that
[1:01:54] the baby can get what it wants is to cry
[1:01:57] for it. We are crying unto you this
[1:01:59] morning. Father, please
[1:02:02] may you come in a special way. Father,
[1:02:04] render the needs of your children
[1:02:06] forever. Those that are sick, those are
[1:02:08] having financial challenges, those are
[1:02:10] having employment challenges, those who

[1:02:15] believe, Father, once we cry unto you,
[1:02:18] all things are possible. Come in a
[1:02:20] special. Above all, we are praying for
[1:02:22] the anointing on the preaching of the
[1:02:24] word. We are yet to be released from all
[1:02:27] guilt and fear. And the only way that
[1:02:29] you release us, father, the only way
[1:02:32] that you deliver us is by faith in your
[1:02:35] word. I know the preacher this morning
[1:02:37] the pastor. Father, the prophet says the
[1:02:40] preaching of the word releases the being
[1:02:43] of God. And once your being is here
[1:02:45] among us, all things are possible. Come
[1:02:48] and minister unto your needs by the
[1:02:50] preaching of the word as we ask all
[1:02:52] these things to be done in that all
[1:02:54] sufficient name of our Lord and Savior
[1:02:56] Christ Jesus. We believe he's a pillar
[1:02:58] of fire. We believe he's that unseen
[1:03:01] companion in our midst. He's he's moving
[1:03:04] already in a midst to prove that this
[1:03:06] word is true by delivering us unto our

[1:23:06] dedicating the ch dedicating the
[1:23:09] children
[1:23:13] and ordaining
[1:23:15] a pastor
[1:23:23] That's That's what I'm here for.
[1:23:31] As you read the word of God for the
[1:23:34] children.
[1:23:52] Mark chapter 10 from verse 13 to verse
[1:23:56] 16.
[1:23:58] And they brought young children to him
[1:24:01] that he should touch them. And his
[1:24:03] disciple rebuked those that brought
[1:24:06] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:24:10] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[1:24:13] the little children to come unto me, and
[1:24:16] forbid them not, for of such is the
[1:24:19] kingdom of God."
[1:24:21] Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall
[1:24:25] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[1:24:28] little child, he shall not enter there
[1:24:30] in. and he took them up in his arms, put
[1:24:34] his hands upon them and blessed them.
[1:24:39] There is something that those parents
[1:24:42] have detected in Jesus.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah. They didn't just bring their
[1:24:50] children there.
[1:24:53] They know if Jesus touch them,
[1:24:59] something will happen to their children.
[1:25:03] I believe these women who are bringing
[1:25:06] their children here,
[1:25:09] they discovered something in the pastor
[1:25:12] here.
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] But if they can bring their children to
[1:25:18] him,
[1:25:22] something will happen to their children.
[1:25:26] I'm here standing in the place of my
[1:25:27] pastor.
[1:25:31] And I believe what is in the pastor is
[1:25:33] in me
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:37] and if they bringing if they believe the
[1:25:39] pastor here
[1:25:42] they must believe me also
[1:25:47] then I'm going to take these children
[1:25:49] into my hands.
[1:25:55] as Jesus has done that.
[1:25:59] I'm going to take them into mine.
[1:26:05] But you may sit down
[1:26:09] believing
[1:26:11] that Jesus is going to use these hands
[1:26:14] of God
[1:26:17] because
[1:26:19] I believe 100%
[1:26:24] that I am his shepherd.
[1:26:29] [Applause]
[1:26:31] He is the shepherd.
[1:26:35] If he is in me,
[1:26:38] I am the shepherd.
[1:26:41] What is the name of the child?
[1:26:51] Let's close our eyes.
[1:26:54] My dear heavenly father,
[1:26:58] you are always present where your
[1:27:01] children are gathered.

[2:00:54] I'm just going to be very short.
[2:00:59] Um my topic is following the angel.
[2:01:05] Um topic that
[2:01:10] does this angel has anything to do with
[2:01:13] us.
[2:01:18] The angel we have read here.
[2:01:23] The Bible says here
[2:01:27] that is the book of revelation.
[2:01:31] He said is the revelation of Jesus
[2:01:33] Christ.
[2:01:36] He said um which God gave unto him
[2:01:41] to show unto his servants
[2:01:46] things which must shortly come.
[2:01:52] He says he sent and signified it by his
[2:01:56] angel
[2:01:59] unto his servant John.
[2:02:03] The Bible says it's a revelation of
[2:02:05] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:09] And he said God has shown it to Jesus
[2:02:13] Christ.
[2:02:17] Then he signified them by his servant.
[2:02:24] They said Jesus while he was still here,
[2:02:29] there were some things which he didn't
[2:02:31] know.
[2:02:34] He said about the coming about my coming
[2:02:40] nobody knows.
[2:02:42] He said even the son
[2:02:45] don't know
[2:02:47] only the father.
[2:02:50] But the Bible says
[2:02:53] our prophet
[2:02:55] says after his dead and resurrection
[2:02:59] then he received from the father
[2:03:03] the revelation of those things.
[2:03:07] Even the the disciples wanted to ask
[2:03:09] him,
[2:03:12] "When are you going to restore the
[2:03:15] kingdom?"
[2:03:17] He said, "No, it is not unto you
[2:03:21] to know things which my father has
[2:03:24] placed in his mind.
[2:03:28] It was not yet revealed to him at the
[2:03:31] time.
[2:03:34] But now we are following this angel.
[2:03:40] The Bible says here
[2:03:43] in Rubapter 19,
[2:03:47] John says,
[2:03:50] "This angel
[2:03:52] said to John, this angel himself,
[2:03:58] I am not God.
[2:04:02] I am the prophet.
[2:04:06] Don't worship me.
[2:04:09] It was the angel.
[2:04:12] Let's just read it. Revelation chapter
[2:04:15] 19 verse 9 to 10.
[2:04:22] Chapter 22. Reb,
[2:04:25] Revelation chapter 19 verse 9- 10 verse
[2:04:28] 9-10.
[2:04:30] And he said unto me, write, blessed are
[2:04:33] they which are called unto the marriage
[2:04:35] supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto
[2:04:38] me, These are the true sayings of God.
[2:04:42] All right? And I fell at his feet to
[2:04:44] worship him. And he said unto me, See,
[2:04:47] thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant
[2:04:51] and of thy brethren that have the
[2:04:53] testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the
[2:04:57] testimony, he said, don't worship God.
[2:05:01] worship God.
[2:05:03] But let's see in Reb 22 verse 82
[2:05:10] from verse 8 to 11 to 11.
[2:05:14] And I John saw these things and heard
[2:05:18] them. And when I had heard and seen, I
[2:05:21] fell down to worship before the feet of
[2:05:23] the angel which showed me these things.
[2:05:27] Then said he unto me, "See thou, do it
[2:05:30] not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of
[2:05:33] thy brethren the prophets, and of them
[2:05:36] which keep the sayings of this book,
[2:05:38] worship God." Amen. And he said unto me,
[2:05:40] "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[2:05:43] this book, for the time is at hand." And
[2:05:46] he that is unjust, let him be unjust
[2:05:48] still. And he which is filthy, let him
[2:05:51] be filthy still. And he that is
[2:05:54] righteous, let him be Russia still. And
[2:05:57] he that is holy, let him be holy still.
[2:06:00] This prophet, this this angel
[2:06:05] when he was showing John these things,
[2:06:09] John thought he was God.
[2:06:13] He wanted to worship them.
[2:06:16] But that angel said,
[2:06:19] "I'm not God.
[2:06:21] I am a prophet.
[2:06:24] But when you read the book of Revel
[2:06:26] 22:16, there
[2:06:30] 16 Jesus said, "I have sent my angel."
[2:06:37] Jesus is calling this angel,
[2:06:41] his angel.
[2:06:43] Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] Then in in Revelation chapter 21,
[2:06:50] law 21 verse 9 verse 9 and verse 15
[2:06:54] verse 15- 16 verse 15- 16
[2:06:58] here the Bible tells us
[2:07:02] that this angel
[2:07:05] measured the city
[2:07:10] but in the
[2:07:13] and when we read the book of future home
[2:07:17] future home we find that the prophet
[2:07:20] says, "I measure the destiny."
[2:07:26] But here the Bible says this angel
[2:07:28] measured.
[2:07:32] But here the prophet says I measured the
[2:07:36] the
[2:07:42] seem it it shows us that
[2:07:46] this is the theophony of this prophet.
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:54] He said Jesus Christ has sent him to
[2:07:57] testify this thing to the churches
[2:08:04] in in Malachi 3
[2:08:08] verse one.
[2:08:11] Before Jesus came,
[2:08:15] Malachi said,
[2:08:17] I sent my messenger
[2:08:23] to forun me
[2:08:25] because the word you are looking for
[2:08:29] will soon come to his temple.
[2:08:32] He said he will send his message
[2:08:37] because the body they were looking for.
[2:08:41] He will come to his temple.
[2:08:43] But before the what they were looking
[2:08:45] for
[2:08:48] can come to his temple.
[2:08:50] He he he will send his messenger.
[2:08:55] What did those people think about this
[2:08:57] thing?
[2:09:00] the messenger
[2:09:02] who will be sent
[2:09:04] before him.
[2:09:07] When that messenger come which was John,
[2:09:12] they were there still looking for the
[2:09:14] messenger.
[2:09:16] But that messenger has come.
[2:09:19] Then we have got another voice
[2:09:24] in 1933
[2:09:26] when my prophet was baptizing the 17th
[2:09:29] person.
[2:09:32] The same voice came.
[2:09:36] He said as John has forun
[2:09:40] my first coming
[2:09:43] you shall for my sins.
[2:09:48] He is the messenger.
[2:09:51] Jesus said he is my messenger
[2:09:54] here. God said I will send my message.
[2:09:59] But there
[2:10:01] in in in Ohio river
[2:10:04] God said I your message
[2:10:09] will forrun my second coming
[2:10:14] because John's message
[2:10:17] for my second my first coming.
[2:10:22] What did the people thought about that
[2:10:27] even now? People will never see this
[2:10:31] angel
[2:10:33] when he is for running his second
[2:10:35] country.
[2:10:39] They will want to know who is this
[2:10:41] angel.
[2:10:45] Some will never will never even take
[2:10:48] care about that angel.
[2:10:52] But some will look who is this angel.
[2:10:56] I wish this morning
[2:10:58] that I had just much time to spend upon
[2:11:02] this phenomena
[2:11:06] that's beyond any shadow of doubt
[2:11:11] proven for the past 30 years
[2:11:17] 35 years
[2:11:19] right here at this church
[2:11:22] since down on the river
[2:11:25] when that same light came down
[2:11:29] here in Jefferson
[2:11:31] in 1933.
[2:11:33] He spoke those ways as John the Baptist
[2:11:37] was sent to forrun the first coming of
[2:11:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:11:44] Your message will forrun the second
[2:11:47] coming.
[2:11:49] We are at the end time.
[2:11:52] We see it. We wonder sometimes
[2:11:57] why it hasn't spread over the earth.
[2:12:02] Maybe sometimes we'll have a chance to
[2:12:04] explain that
[2:12:08] if God willing
[2:12:10] this angel
[2:12:12] is
[2:12:13] he was he was the theophony
[2:12:18] of this angel here.
[2:12:21] He showed John those things.
[2:12:24] and he showed us these things.
[2:12:27] Amen. He is the same angel.
[2:12:33] The B brother says, he says, "When the
[2:12:37] seals are broke
[2:12:40] and the mystery is revealed,
[2:12:44] down comes the angel,
[2:12:47] the messenger,
[2:12:49] Christ, setting his foot upon the land.
[2:12:54] and upon the sea with a rainbow
[2:12:59] over his head. Now remember this seventh
[2:13:03] angel
[2:13:06] is on earth at the time of this coming.
[2:13:11] When this one is coming down
[2:13:15] with the book in his hand,
[2:13:20] this one is on earth. Before
[2:13:26] we can look at this book,
[2:13:30] but we must read chapter 5.
[2:13:33] But we find the book in the hand
[2:13:38] of the one who seated on the throne.
[2:13:42] But we must first of all we must know
[2:13:45] how the book got inside that.
[2:13:51] Then we read John 1 vers1.
[2:13:56] In John 1 vers1
[2:14:00] it says in the beginning was the way and
[2:14:05] the weight was with God and the weight
[2:14:09] was God.
[2:14:11] The prophet said if we want to read it
[2:14:15] we can say in the beginning was a
[2:14:18] theophony
[2:14:19] theophony. was with God and the was God
[2:14:25] and the Bible says everything
[2:14:29] was made by that.
[2:14:32] That is what the Bible says. In other
[2:14:35] words,
[2:14:36] John 1 verse one.
[2:14:40] It is it happened before Genesis 1
[2:14:46] verse 26 to 28
[2:14:48] 26-28 when God was saying let us create
[2:14:52] men in our image
[2:14:55] he was a theophony
[2:14:58] in John 1 verse1
[2:15:02] the spirit
[2:15:04] came down in a form that the man could
[2:15:08] have an idea
[2:15:10] what God is. And when he came in that
[2:15:14] form, he was a theophony.
[2:15:18] He came in that form so that he can
[2:15:21] create.
[2:15:22] When he create, he created man in his
[2:15:26] own image. The man he created in his own
[2:15:31] image. He was a theophony.
[2:15:34] Then in Genesis chapter 2
[2:15:38] we see God forming man out of the dust
[2:15:42] of the earth. When he has formed man of
[2:15:45] dust of the earth he took that
[2:15:49] and put it in that man.
[2:15:52] He took the creation
[2:15:54] and put it in the formation.
[2:15:58] Then Adam
[2:16:00] became a living
[2:16:04] when when he fell because a theophony
[2:16:09] is God's part of God. But when Adam
[2:16:13] fell, God cannot fail. So God took
[2:16:19] his part out of the formation
[2:16:23] and the formation remained there. Then
[2:16:26] it was Adam that has taken his
[2:16:31] took he took all the
[2:16:34] put them in his hand in the form of a
[2:16:38] book
[2:16:40] and he was there sitting in his room
[2:16:44] that
[2:16:47] is our theophony
[2:16:50] because they say in that book there are
[2:16:53] names
[2:16:55] then names there. They are the names of
[2:16:58] the redeemer.
[2:17:01] Then he he place them there so that he
[2:17:04] must do the work of redemption
[2:17:08] so that he can take them back
[2:17:11] in that formation.
[2:17:15] Amen. To take them back there, he must
[2:17:17] do the work of redemption.
[2:17:20] He came himself
[2:17:23] flesh. do the work of redemption and
[2:17:26] during seven church ages as he was a son
[2:17:29] of God. He was doing the work of
[2:17:32] redemption
[2:17:34] bringing us back
[2:17:37] so that we can go back to our glorified
[2:17:39] bodies.
[2:17:41] We can now go back to our glorified
[2:17:42] bodies
[2:17:44] in in that in that fallen form.
[2:17:48] He had to come
[2:17:51] and and and make a way
[2:17:54] for us to get into our original voice.
[2:18:00] He he he did that during seven church
[2:18:03] ages.
[2:18:05] As a son of God,
[2:18:09] he was a mediator
[2:18:12] during seven church age. But our prophet
[2:18:15] told me at the end of the seven churches
[2:18:20] at the end of the dispens of the son of
[2:18:23] God
[2:18:25] and between the dispense of the son of
[2:18:27] God
[2:18:29] and the son of David.
[2:18:32] The son of man must be revealed again.
[2:18:37] According to Luke 17
[2:18:40] verse 30 verse 30. The son of man must
[2:18:44] be revealed at the end of the
[2:18:46] dispensation of the son of God.
[2:18:50] And when the son of god dispensation,
[2:18:55] it means he is no more a
[2:19:01] because he's changing
[2:19:03] to another dispensation.
[2:19:06] The dispensation of the
[2:19:11] God is flesh.
[2:19:14] Then we see that angel
[2:19:19] because that dispensation can come.
[2:19:24] This this man, he had to go to the west
[2:19:29] to connect to connect with what? with
[2:19:33] this angel
[2:19:35] because in the pyramid there
[2:19:39] there was a west stone
[2:19:42] that must be revealed
[2:19:45] and this man to know this because it was
[2:19:48] another ministry.
[2:19:51] He must go and connect
[2:19:55] this this man here
[2:19:58] who is will
[2:20:01] must connect with this angel
[2:20:03] because Jesus said I sent this angel to
[2:20:07] the churches.
[2:20:10] He had the message of all the churches.
[2:20:15] Amen.
[2:20:17] To complete
[2:20:19] because there is a pyramid pyramid
[2:20:23] here
[2:20:25] where we see the first church age
[2:20:28] being
[2:20:30] and we see the messenger there. Above
[2:20:33] there
[2:20:34] we see another small pyramid
[2:20:38] in that it is written love.
[2:20:42] that pyramid pyramid is what the prophet
[2:20:45] went west for.
[2:20:50] Because he was taken into the pyramid
[2:20:54] of angels.
[2:20:57] He said
[2:21:00] those angels
[2:21:02] they are the ones who brought the book
[2:21:07] to him.
[2:21:09] That is what he said.
[2:21:12] That is what he said
[2:21:14] and they brought the book
[2:21:18] means that
[2:21:20] I went there to connect with the angel's
[2:21:25] message
[2:21:26] and come back with what the
[2:21:30] interpretation.
[2:21:32] What is that interpretation?
[2:21:36] [Music]
[2:21:38] [Applause]
[2:21:43] He said
[2:21:46] it seven times
[2:21:49] to something I have seen.
[2:21:52] He said I needed an interpretation
[2:21:55] but it was flying
[2:21:58] that interpretation.
[2:22:01] But when he's coming back where was the
[2:22:03] interpretation now in him?
[2:22:08] Amen.
[2:22:09] Because he connected
[2:22:12] [Applause]
[2:22:14] with the interpretation.
[2:22:17] He said that angel
[2:22:20] spoke to me.
[2:22:23] Which one? The notable angel.
[2:22:31] He was the one
[2:22:33] who showed
[2:22:36] these things.
[2:22:39] He is the one who is showing us these
[2:22:43] things.
[2:22:45] [Applause]
[2:22:49] He said,
[2:22:51] "The son of man
[2:22:54] revealed himself
[2:22:57] through the prophet.
[2:22:59] through the prophet.
[2:23:01] In other words, Christ himself
[2:23:04] revealed himself
[2:23:07] in the prophet.
[2:23:10] It was Christ in him.
[2:23:14] He came, the Bible says in this
[2:23:18] he took the book
[2:23:21] from the one who was sitting on the
[2:23:24] throne.
[2:23:26] took the book.
[2:23:28] When the when when the announcement was
[2:23:32] given,
[2:23:34] he said the line of the tribe of Luca
[2:23:38] has the tribe of Judah Judah has
[2:23:41] prevailed.
[2:23:44] But when John looked,
[2:23:46] he saw a lamb.
[2:23:51] But the the message said
[2:23:54] lion
[2:23:57] It was a changing of dispensation
[2:24:02] when he stood there. When he stood there
[2:24:05] as a lamb, he was a mediator. He was
[2:24:10] doing the redemption work because there
[2:24:13] was names in
[2:24:16] my name.
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:21] Then when he was doing that after he
[2:24:25] took the book,
[2:24:29] he said, "He who overcometh
[2:24:32] shall sit with me in my throne because I
[2:24:37] have overcome
[2:24:39] and aced with my father
[2:24:41] in his throne.
[2:24:44] Hallelujah. What is father's truth?
[2:24:48] The Lord you are looking for will come
[2:24:50] to his truth.
[2:24:53] What is God's truth? Jesus is God's
[2:24:56] truth.
[2:24:59] Amen. Amen. He said he seated with his
[2:25:02] father
[2:25:04] in his father's thromb.
[2:25:16] If he is in you, in other words, you
[2:25:19] have got the son and the father
[2:25:24] in you.
[2:25:26] Amen.
[2:25:27] Amen. He took the book from the throne.
[2:25:32] Where was his father?
[2:25:35] He his father was in his
[2:25:39] throne was Jesus. It's Jesus himself. In
[2:25:43] other words, if he took the book from
[2:25:47] he took it from within himself
[2:25:50] [Applause]
[2:25:54] and open when he when he took the book,
[2:25:58] he became a lion. After he's taken the
[2:26:01] book, he become a lion.
[2:26:05] The Bible says when he was coming, he
[2:26:08] rode this lion.
[2:26:12] That's why the angel said the lion
[2:26:16] the lion has prevailed
[2:26:19] to take the boot. Now he is the lion.
[2:26:24] The lion means he is the king.
[2:26:28] He is the He is the king of the bride.
[2:26:32] Amen.
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:39] This is the angel
[2:26:44] when when when he when the earthly angel
[2:26:48] come.
[2:26:50] He came with the interpretation.
[2:26:54] The interpretation was with it.
[2:26:57] Amen. He said, "I come back with the
[2:27:00] in."
[2:27:06] He said,
[2:27:08] "Those angels
[2:27:11] brought that book."
[2:27:16] And when we read, we see Christ bringing
[2:27:21] the book. When when this angel
[2:27:26] received the book,
[2:27:28] He received it in a form of a sword.
[2:27:34] When he was wondering,
[2:27:36] they said it was a book
[2:27:40] in your hand.
[2:27:43] Let me change
[2:27:45] and take another position.
[2:27:51] Where is the pastor is going to be
[2:27:53] ordained here?
[2:27:58] Can you stand up?
[2:28:08] Thank you my brother. God bless you.
[2:28:14] Where are the people who have come with
[2:28:16] him?
[2:28:27] God bless you.
[2:28:29] [Applause]
[2:28:37] I am I am ordained by this pastor.
[2:28:47] He just he didn't just ordain me.
[2:28:51] He saw something.
[2:28:56] It was not just It was not just because
[2:28:59] people said
[2:29:03] we want this man to be
[2:29:07] but the pastor himself.
[2:29:16] Pastorship
[2:29:18] is a very important position
[2:29:26] among the five-fold ministry.
[2:29:30] Pastorship
[2:29:32] is an important position
[2:29:36] because he is shephering all those
[2:29:38] position.
[2:29:43] Even when they brought people,
[2:29:45] they bring them to the pastor
[2:29:48] to shepherd them.
[2:29:52] He is not a man-made man.
[2:29:56] He's not chosen by man.
[2:29:59] He's chosen by God.
[2:30:01] [Applause]
[2:30:03] It's not the man who can say
[2:30:06] I want to be a I when you see 10 people
[2:30:11] count them 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 is 10 then I
[2:30:15] can be a pastor of these people
[2:30:18] tell them I I'm the pastor
[2:30:23] then this man
[2:30:26] hey what about you choose more to be
[2:30:31] It is not like that
[2:30:36] is a God
[2:30:38] given
[2:30:41] position.
[2:30:44] It's not the man that can say I want to
[2:30:46] be a pastor.
[2:30:48] What is that?
[2:30:53] It is a godgiven position.
[2:30:58] Read Jeremiah Jeremiah
[2:31:06] 23:1-4.
[2:31:08] Jeremiah 23 verse 1-4.
[2:31:14] Who be unto the pastors that destroy and
[2:31:18] scatter the sheep of my pasture? Say the
[2:31:21] Lord. Amen. Therefore, thus say the Lord
[2:31:24] God of Israel against the pastors that
[2:31:26] feed my people. Ye have scattered my
[2:31:30] flock and driven them away and have not
[2:31:33] gathered them.
[2:31:37] This is the time of gathering the sheep
[2:31:42] and God must set a pastor.
[2:31:47] Not man, but God.
[2:31:50] I read this in the Old Testament.
[2:31:53] In the Old Testament there,
[2:31:57] we read about these things
[2:32:00] that um brother Brennham says
[2:32:06] in those days
[2:32:09] when the owner of the sheep,
[2:32:14] not when the sheep needed the shepherd,
[2:32:18] but when the owner
[2:32:21] needed the shepherd. Thus said the
[2:32:24] prophet. He said in those days
[2:32:29] for a sheep for a shepherd
[2:32:32] cares for the sheep
[2:32:36] which is not the his
[2:32:40] he's look he cares for the sheep
[2:32:43] which is not his
[2:32:48] in the old testament
[2:32:52] the Great
[2:32:55] shepherd
[2:32:57] was used to describe leaders
[2:33:02] who protected
[2:33:05] and ke
[2:33:07] and guide
[2:33:09] God's people
[2:33:11] in the Old Testament.
[2:33:13] Are you together with me? The word
[2:33:16] pastor
[2:33:18] is shepherd.
[2:33:21] That's the prophet. The word pastor
[2:33:25] is shepherd.
[2:33:27] Then in the old testament
[2:33:29] when they talk about pastors
[2:33:32] they were talking about people
[2:33:35] who cared
[2:33:38] who protected
[2:33:40] who guided God's people.
[2:33:43] Example of those people
[2:33:46] were priests,
[2:33:48] judges,
[2:33:50] prophets, kings. Those people were
[2:33:55] classed as pastors.
[2:33:58] They were classed as shepherds.
[2:34:02] Was choosing them.
[2:34:08] People were going there. Let's just
[2:34:09] choose this man.
[2:34:12] God himself
[2:34:15] [Music]
[2:34:16] when when people went on they start to
[2:34:20] choose themselves. That's why when God
[2:34:22] comes here he said who unto those
[2:34:25] shepherds
[2:34:31] God is saying the same thing even now
[2:34:35] because pastorship
[2:34:37] is attacked by crooks.
[2:34:41] [Applause]
[2:34:47] who are not god orained pastors.
[2:34:56] These priests,
[2:34:58] judges,
[2:35:01] prophets,
[2:35:03] when whatever whenever you take
[2:35:05] something,
[2:35:07] you must stud it from back
[2:35:10] and you must bring it here.
[2:35:12] You mustn't just
[2:35:15] you must understand where this thing
[2:35:17] come from.
[2:35:19] [Applause]
[2:35:21] They were shepherd of God's people.
[2:35:24] I mean those priests judges
[2:35:29] we see them in Jeremiah.
[2:35:32] God said I will set up shepherd over
[2:35:36] them.
[2:35:39] His people Israel
[2:35:43] I said in those days when the owner of
[2:35:48] the ship needed a shepherd,
[2:35:52] he had to get the best shepherd.
[2:35:57] He must be a special
[2:36:00] trained man
[2:36:02] who knows to take care of the sheep.
[2:36:06] Listen here. There is there is something
[2:36:10] little there is little something
[2:36:13] in those sheep in those sheep
[2:36:18] that they see about that shepherd.
[2:36:24] This sheep could recognize
[2:36:28] something in that man
[2:36:32] that this man is a shepherd.
[2:36:37] That's why the prophet says
[2:36:40] we we recognize the gift
[2:36:43] in a man.
[2:36:46] Then we ordained that man
[2:36:50] to be a shepherd because we have
[2:36:52] recognized that gift.
[2:36:55] We don't just ordain a man.
[2:36:59] In the book of revelation, book of
[2:37:01] symbols,
[2:37:03] the prophet says,
[2:37:06] the word shepherd,
[2:37:08] the word
[2:37:10] is a shepherd.
[2:37:13] Let me just see if I can find the book
[2:37:15] first. Here
[2:37:17] he said the word shepherd,
[2:37:20] the word pastor is a shepherd
[2:37:23] and they chosen by God.
[2:37:26] The Holy Ghost
[2:37:28] has made him overseer
[2:37:33] over his ships.
[2:37:36] He said here, let me just read it.
[2:37:40] Uh he said um therefore I read it in the
[2:37:43] in the middle of the therefore a pastor
[2:37:45] should never leave that word
[2:37:50] but stay straight with the word because
[2:37:53] he is feeding you
[2:37:56] straight
[2:37:57] because that the word pastor means
[2:38:00] shepherd.
[2:38:02] Look it up. Find out if that that is not
[2:38:06] right.
[2:38:08] A pastor is a shepherd.
[2:38:11] The Holy Ghost has made him overseer.
[2:38:17] People have made him oversee.
[2:38:22] The Bible say the Holy Ghost has made
[2:38:26] him oversee.
[2:38:34] Not these
[2:38:36] little boys.
[2:38:38] stand. We are pastors.
[2:38:44] The Holy Ghost has made him
[2:38:48] oversee.
[2:38:50] [Applause]
[2:38:53] That is what the prophet says here over
[2:38:56] his church.
[2:38:58] Flock
[2:39:00] to feed them with what? The word of God.
[2:39:08] The prophet says the pastor is the
[2:39:11] husband
[2:39:14] of the church,
[2:39:19] he must impregnate it.
[2:39:23] Hallelujah.
[2:39:24] If he if he is terror,
[2:39:37] he's a he's he's a shepherd. He's a
[2:39:39] husband, but he's
[2:39:45] But he must impregnate.
[2:39:56] That church is full of argument,
[2:40:01] lies,
[2:40:04] backbiting,
[2:40:15] The Holy Ghost which has made him
[2:40:17] shepherd
[2:40:20] brings the message directly to him
[2:40:23] not to the sheep
[2:40:27] when a sheep says I've seen goat
[2:40:34] because the prophet says the holy ghost
[2:40:37] take the message directly to the
[2:40:40] shepherd. If it is a god orained
[2:40:44] shepherd,
[2:40:49] but if he's not god orained shepherd
[2:40:55] and their great their great chief
[2:40:58] shepherd,
[2:41:01] the one who has made them
[2:41:06] will reward them.
[2:41:08] will reward these pastors.
[2:41:12] He he has ordained them.
[2:41:15] He will reward them.
[2:41:18] They don't need a reward from someone.
[2:41:22] They are looking after the sheep
[2:41:26] which which is not theirs. They have got
[2:41:29] the owner of the sheep. The owner of the
[2:41:32] sheep, he is looking at the shepherd to
[2:41:36] take care. But in fact, my brother,
[2:41:40] the owner take the boot of the shepherd
[2:41:45] to take care of his sheep using the body
[2:41:48] of this man.
[2:41:50] [Applause]
[2:41:53] Pastorship is an office
[2:41:58] not elected by men.
[2:42:01] but elected by God.
[2:42:04] Let me read something here
[2:42:11] is chosen by me. But let me read what
[2:42:14] the prophet say.
[2:42:16] There is five offices elected of God
[2:42:21] for God for God has said in the church
[2:42:26] apostles,
[2:42:28] prophets, teachers, pastors,
[2:42:32] evangelists.
[2:42:34] God did that.
[2:42:37] Man has deacons.
[2:42:40] Men has deacons. In other words, deacons
[2:42:45] are chosen by us, but pastors are chosen
[2:42:49] by
[2:42:53] said the prophet.
[2:42:57] Who has chosen you?
[2:43:04] But God set in the church
[2:43:08] for the perfecting of the church.
[2:43:11] You can't divide it.
[2:43:17] We identify the gift
[2:43:22] in a man.
[2:43:24] Then we ordain the man
[2:43:27] because we have identified
[2:43:30] the gift in a man.
[2:43:34] Guess why? Guess that's why my pastor
[2:43:41] he said
[2:43:43] he said not me. He said I identify the
[2:43:47] gift in this man.
[2:43:49] [Music]
[2:43:52] Not me,
[2:43:55] not my church.
[2:44:00] He would have he would have receive
[2:44:01] refused. He would have refused.
[2:44:09] Let me tell you
[2:44:12] the the way I know my pastor
[2:44:16] nonsense. He doesn't take any nonsense.
[2:44:28] Now, now the Bible times,
[2:44:32] the way they ordain a minister
[2:44:35] was recognizing a gift of God in the
[2:44:38] ministry
[2:44:41] in the Bible church where they ordain a
[2:44:44] minister,
[2:44:45] they recognize a gift of God in that
[2:44:49] in that in minister's ministry.
[2:44:54] Then he said here
[2:44:57] they notice him being a staunch
[2:45:00] Christian
[2:45:03] a gift of speaking.
[2:45:06] Here he's talking about Timothy.
[2:45:09] That is the way they did also
[2:45:11] to the ministers by laying hands given
[2:45:15] the right hand of fellowship
[2:45:18] to work together.
[2:45:22] Where is we can call the brother to come
[2:45:25] forth.

[3:16:25] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:16:28] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[3:16:31] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:16:34] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:16:36] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[3:16:38] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:16:41] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:16:44] them,"Repent and be baptized every one
[3:16:47] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:16:50] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:16:52] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:16:55] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:16:57] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:17:00] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:17:03] call."
