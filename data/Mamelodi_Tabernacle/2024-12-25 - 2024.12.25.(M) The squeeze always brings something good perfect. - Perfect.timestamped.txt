[1:32:42] age they had theirs and trainers

[1:32:55] because they're going to hear the

[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:29] people are making noise
[1:33:33] outside you have got many prophets
[1:33:39] outside now some of them
[1:33:44] are making people fall
[1:33:48] like FES being doomed
[1:33:58] some of them are trying to
[1:34:08] desend but there is a a quietness
[1:34:19] somewhere just like during his first
[1:34:22] coming
[1:34:26] when people are making noise
[1:34:31] outside telling people that is
[1:34:38] coming attracting many
[1:34:43] CRS but they Vision
[1:34:47] Con in that
[1:34:50] silence and this is the same silent
[1:34:52] which is now here
[1:34:56] we are
[1:34:58] just
[1:34:59] attending a marriage um
[1:35:09] pregnancy because we are already
[1:35:14] pregnant in that silence
[1:35:34] let's read the book of Romans chapter
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:41] 8s 17 and 18 ver 17
[1:35:48] 18 Romans chapter 8 verse 17 and
[1:35:52] 18 and if children then as as of God and
[1:35:57] join us with Christ if so be that we
[1:36:01] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:36:04] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:36:08] suffering of this present time are not
[1:36:10] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:36:13] which shall be revealed in
[1:36:16] us let's just close our eyes as we ask
[1:36:20] our pastor Pastor Sal to pray for this

[1:37:04] since the beginning of the
[1:37:07] world and all the churches are looking
[1:37:10] exactly but they cannot
[1:37:12] find but by your grace you predestinated
[1:37:17] us to find the
[1:37:19] secret and today oh Lord we are
[1:37:23] gathering

[1:38:39] be squee bring something good
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:56] because according to our
[1:39:00] Prophet the seed has become the seed
[1:39:05] again and if the seat has become the
[1:39:08] seed
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:10] again it does not need any rain

[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:16] squeeze is to press something from

[1:40:27] the
[1:40:30] orange you have to squee the
[1:40:34] orang so that you can get that
[1:40:39] juice or is to force something to go
[1:40:48] through or to go into
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:55] passing through difficult
[1:40:58] time that
[1:41:01] squee let me read something
[1:41:05] here
[1:41:08] he the True Church of Jesus
[1:41:13] Christ the bride is liken to a
[1:41:20] p her righteousness is his
[1:41:30] attributes his own
[1:41:36] glorious identity is found in
[1:41:40] him her
[1:41:43] identity is found in
[1:41:46] him what he
[1:41:48] is she is to reflect
[1:41:54] what he
[1:41:55] has she is to
[1:41:59] manifest there is no fault in
[1:42:03] her she is all glorious within and
[1:42:09] without from beginning to the
[1:42:14] ending she is the work of a
[1:42:18] lord is the work of a lord
[1:42:23] and all his works are
[1:42:28] perfect in fact in her is s
[1:42:34] up and manifested the Eternal
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:41] wisdom and of
[1:42:45] God how can one phom
[1:42:49] it how can one understand it
[1:42:53] though we cannot do
[1:42:55] that we accept it by
[1:42:58] faith for God has spoken
[1:43:01] it but not only is the Candlestick of
[1:43:08] gold a
[1:43:12] beaten
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:16] handen according to her
[1:43:19] blueprint which Spirit given
[1:43:23] outside of a
[1:43:26] Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever p
[1:43:31] a people so
[1:43:34] beaten and P the of
[1:43:39] Jesus he is filling up the
[1:43:44] suffering that Christ has
[1:43:48] left goods are spoiled
[1:43:53] her life is in
[1:43:57] Jey she is accounted as a sheep
[1:44:02] for she is killed all the
[1:44:06] day she suffered
[1:44:08] much but in in in it
[1:44:13] allate not retaliate
[1:44:17] not neither does she cause others to
[1:44:20] suffer
[1:44:23] Wy of the Gospel is the lovely bread of
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:30] Christ gold
[1:44:34] isable whereas brass will break with the
[1:44:41] beating this gold of God will bear her
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:48] suffering Not Bow not broken not destroy
[1:44:54] but formed as a thing of
[1:44:59] beauty a joy
[1:45:02] forever my trials and
[1:45:08] tting praise God that is what peace amen
[1:45:14] that is what peace
[1:45:17] is Jesus was also squee
[1:45:24] to be
[1:45:25] perfect by the by the things he
[1:45:32] suffered I said Peace always bring
[1:45:35] something
[1:45:41] perfect he learned
[1:45:43] obedience you see he
[1:45:46] himself he
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:49] suffered he learned obedience by the
[1:45:53] that he
[1:45:57] suffered he made perfect he actually
[1:46:01] made
[1:46:03] perfect by the things that he
[1:46:08] suffered he was a
[1:46:11] son yet he yet he Lear
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] obedience May the things which he
[1:46:21] suffered being made
[1:46:24] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:32] salvation unto all them unto all them
[1:46:35] that obey
[1:46:38] him in a plain
[1:46:41] language the very character of Jesus
[1:46:46] Christ was perfected by suffering
[1:46:53] to PA he has left his church a measure
[1:46:57] of
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:05] suffering by their faith in suffering
[1:47:09] for
[1:47:11] him would come to a place of
[1:47:16] perfection so I
[1:47:19] reckon that the suffering of this
[1:47:22] present time
[1:47:25] are not worthy to be compared the
[1:47:30] glory which shall be revealed in
[1:47:34] US unless we suffer with
[1:47:37] him we cannot with
[1:47:41] him you have to suffer to
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:45] rain the reason for this is that
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] character simply is never made without
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:48:00] suffering character is not character is
[1:48:02] a
[1:48:04] victory it's not a
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:10] gift a man without
[1:48:15] character cannot dream
[1:48:18] canot because power apart from cour
[1:48:25] is
[1:48:29] Satan with
[1:48:32] character is fit to
[1:48:36] Ru you cannot have
[1:48:39] character unless you have gone through
[1:48:44] suffering after you have
[1:48:47] suffered then you have character
[1:48:53] before a Christian can be a Christian
[1:48:57] before before a Christian can be a
[1:49:00] perfect
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:06] Christian he must be
[1:49:13] squee
[1:49:15] so he
[1:49:19] himself must be SED
[1:49:25] let me read something for you
[1:49:27] here there was too much of you in
[1:49:36] you had to squee it
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:46] out and while that King was coming off
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:53] it is
[1:49:55] hot but after a
[1:49:58] while the sky will clear
[1:50:02] back then you will see the purose of
[1:50:07] God then you will
[1:50:10] cry I know my redeemer
[1:50:16] Liv this little
[1:50:19] child and things are just
[1:50:23] it's just for a
[1:50:24] moment and they will fade and pass
[1:50:29] away but they are only done for your
[1:50:34] good let us remember that God would get
[1:50:38] Glory out of
[1:50:43] it
[1:50:46] beautiful is
[1:50:50] kissing is kissing you out of you
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:59] Because unless you are squeed out of
[1:51:06] you you never become a
[1:51:10] CH always
[1:51:13] say the way I
[1:51:15] think way I see
[1:51:17] it then you must
[1:51:23] it must be God who through
[1:51:27] you it must be God who sees through
[1:51:32] you amen beautiful it is written in one
[1:51:37] of the
[1:51:38] scriptures in the Bible that trials are
[1:51:42] brought upon
[1:51:45] us and are more precious to us than
[1:51:54] it is God giving us those
[1:51:58] trials and after we become his
[1:52:03] property and our
[1:52:06] confession and our
[1:52:09] baptis promise to walk in life for
[1:52:15] him every trial that comes upon
[1:52:20] us is to perfect
[1:52:23] us for
[1:52:26] hisory is to bring
[1:52:29] us to a place where God can make himself
[1:52:33] more real to us than before
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:42] Tri you must
[1:52:47] Beed when you
[1:52:50] are then you become
[1:52:53] what you ought to
[1:52:57] be you are born here in
[1:53:02] s and coming to the world speak
[1:53:07] life you have to be
[1:53:10] transformed and this p is one of
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] transformation that is the way you are
[1:53:19] transformed
[1:53:23] after the
[1:53:24] squeeze the Christian becomes
[1:53:29] perfect a kiss becomes
[1:53:35] settled a kiss becomes
[1:53:40] established a Christian becomes
[1:53:44] strengthened no more
[1:53:48] unstable let me
[1:53:50] repeat after this spee
[1:53:53] the Christian becomes
[1:53:56] perfect he becomes
[1:53:59] established in the faith he become
[1:54:04] strengthened in the faith he becom
[1:54:09] settled in the fa no more
[1:54:17] unstable because if he has not gone
[1:54:21] through these things
[1:54:24] after a while you will find him being
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:34] anist
[1:54:36] amen before the children of Israel could
[1:54:39] get out of bondage in
[1:54:47] Egypt they were persecuted
[1:54:52] were
[1:54:57] Afflicted they were given a number of
[1:54:59] bricks to
[1:55:06] produce but when the
[1:55:10] message of them of freeing them out of
[1:55:17] bondage when that message arrives
[1:55:22] the afflictions to be
[1:55:29] more now far

[2:09:07] worship of an
[2:09:10] image forcing
[2:09:13] people to worship the
[2:09:17] image of of a holy man
[2:09:22] you must
[2:09:23] remember that
[2:09:25] image was the image of
[2:09:32] Daniel after Daniel has interpreted the
[2:09:35] dream of the
[2:09:39] king the king
[2:09:42] believed that
[2:09:44] his who
[2:09:46] was was
[2:09:49] in it was his God
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:52] even though he
[2:09:54] said this is the
[2:09:58] of he believe that
[2:10:03] his was the one who was in
[2:10:06] Dani why he changed the name of

[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:12] Daniel then he made the image of Dan
[2:10:21] [Music]

[2:10:28] people to worship that
[2:10:32] image the gentle
[2:10:35] dispensation will end the same
[2:10:39] way there will come a
[2:10:41] time where you will be
[2:10:44] fored to worship an
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:48] image it will seem to be a nice

[2:11:00] end being the world councel of
[2:11:05] churches we know you know it is already
[2:11:10] prophesied that it will
[2:11:13] happen and we know it will happen

[2:13:08] image this temptation is exactly like
[2:13:11] the Temptation in
[2:13:15] Eden it will be a very inviting
[2:13:19] proposition
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:24] held up in direct opposition to God's
[2:13:27] commanded
