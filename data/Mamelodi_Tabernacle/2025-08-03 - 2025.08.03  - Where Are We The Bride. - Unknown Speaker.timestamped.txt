[1:01:02] church this morning.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Father God, here is the list of the
[1:01:06] prayer request.
[1:01:08] We know Lord God before they giving
[1:01:11] think about writing them you have
[1:01:13] already answered
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; because you know our heart
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; you know the deepest secret of a human
[1:01:21] being and there's nothing that can hit
[1:01:24] before thee
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Lord God you have given us the sunshine
[1:01:27] this morning thank you once more Lord
[1:01:30] God
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; may you grant heavenly father
[1:01:35] the healing and the request to your
[1:01:38] children
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; because they found it appropriate this

[1:01:44] mercy

[1:02:06] us what we request Lord God
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; others did not had an opportunity of
[1:02:12] writing their request this morning
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean they are not going through
[1:02:17] a lot
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; you know our heart desire. You know what
[1:02:21] you are going through and you will
[1:02:23] answer at the right time. But this

[1:02:28] request before God, let him receive it.
[1:02:34] This is the right place to be. This is
[1:02:37] the right place where we present our
[1:02:39] matter and we know we are worshiping
[1:02:41] unfailing God. Oh, father god.

[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] on to Jesus.
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Can you read the
[1:17:50] scripture?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; As we read Mark 10 from verse 13- 16.
[1:17:57] And they brought young children to him
[1:17:59] that he should touch them. and his
[1:18:02] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:18:04] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:18:07] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[1:18:10] the little children to come unto me, and
[1:18:12] forbid them not, for of such is the
[1:18:15] kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you,
[1:18:19] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:18:21] of God as a little child, he shall not
[1:18:23] enter therein." And he took them up in
[1:18:26] his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[1:18:29] blessed them.
[1:18:31] We don't baptize children
[1:18:36] because we have not found it in the
[1:18:39] Bible.
[1:18:42] If somebody can come and show us
[1:18:47] here is the verse in the Bible
[1:18:51] but tell children
[1:18:54] then we shall do that.
[1:18:57] But because we don't have such
[1:18:59] scriptures,
[1:19:01] we have got this one
[1:19:04] that children must be
[1:19:07] dedicated
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; dedicated.
[1:19:11] Then here is the child in front of me
[1:19:14] and the mother
[1:19:17] and the father.
[1:19:19] I'm happy to receive this child here.
[1:19:24] What is the name of the child?
[1:19:30] All right,
[1:19:32] let us close our eyes.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father,
[1:19:40] once more
[1:19:42] in my hand
[1:19:44] there is a child.
[1:19:47] As it has been,
[1:19:50] so it is.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe
[1:19:56] you will use my hand
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; as your hand.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; If
[1:20:04] by grace
[1:20:06] you find it good
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; that you can use my hand
[1:20:12] then I am taking the child in my hand
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; to bless the child.

[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:37:00] Let's stand on our feet as we open the
[1:37:02] book of Isaiah.
[1:37:08] Hosea chapter
[1:37:12] 6.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I I'm going to read verse one to um
[1:37:22] verse 1 to 3 I think. So
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; chapter 6 from verse 1 to3 I believe
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; and then uh we are going to read also
[1:37:31] the book of Luke.
[1:37:36] Let's start by
[1:37:40] chapter 6 vers from verse 1 to three.
[1:37:45] Come and let us return unto the Lord for
[1:37:49] he hath torn and he will heal us. He
[1:37:53] hath smitten and he will bind us up.
[1:37:57] After two days will he res revive us. In
[1:38:01] the third day he will rise us up and we
[1:38:04] shall live in his sight. Then shall we
[1:38:08] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[1:38:11] his going forth is prepared as the
[1:38:15] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[1:38:18] rain as the latter and former rain unto
[1:38:21] the earth.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Let's read the book of Luke chapter
[1:38:26] 21.
[1:38:32] Um
[1:38:35] we're going to read verse um
[1:38:39] five and six
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; and we're going to read also 9 to2
[1:38:50] Luke chapter 21 from verse 5 and 6.
[1:38:55] And as some spake of the temple, how it
[1:38:58] was adorned with goodly stones and
[1:39:02] gifts, he said, "As for these things
[1:39:05] which he behold, the days will come, in
[1:39:09] the which there shall not be left one
[1:39:11] stone upon another,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; that shall not be thrown down." Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Verse N.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But when you shall hear of wars and
[1:39:22] commotions, be not terrified,
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; for these things must first come to
[1:39:27] pass,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; but the end is not by and by.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Then said he unto them, nation shall
[1:39:34] rise against nation,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; and kingdoms against kingdoms.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; to to
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; verse 11. And great earthquakes shall be
[1:39:45] in diverse places,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; and fairmines and pestilence,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and fearful sides,
[1:39:53] and great signs shall there be from
[1:39:55] heaven.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But before all this, they shall lay
[1:39:59] their hands on you,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and persecute you, delivering you up to
[1:40:04] the synagogues
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; and into prison, being brought before
[1:40:08] kings and rulers for my name's sake.
[1:40:12] Close our eyes.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; standing here
[1:40:20] in front of your children,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; not worthy.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; But you are the worthy one.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I'm asking as we have read the
[1:40:34] scriptures.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Use my voice and my brother's voice.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] Let's let us deliver your message
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; to your children.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; We pray
[1:40:51] and asking in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:53] Christ. Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats.
[1:41:05] I'm
[1:41:08] going to just have this as a topic.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; The bride
[1:41:24] and the subtopic.
[1:41:29] It pays to take warnings.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Take
[1:41:40] warnings.
[1:41:47] Um
[1:41:51] we are living
[1:41:54] at the end time.
[1:42:00] In other words, we are living beyond
[1:42:05] beyond time
[1:42:10] because we know seven church ages
[1:42:16] is time.
[1:42:21] Then John was privileged
[1:42:27] to see
[1:42:30] those seven churches
[1:42:34] and all things which happened there.
[1:42:39] John saw those things.
[1:42:44] Are you hearing?
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; I say John saw them.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Why don't you wonder?
[1:42:51] Because John's eyes was not there.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; They've taken out his eyes.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says he saw
[1:43:08] what happened in different ages.
[1:43:15] He
[1:43:17] he wrote those things.
[1:43:21] He was told by the angel
[1:43:26] until he finished all those seven
[1:43:28] churches
[1:43:32] at the end there
[1:43:36] chapter 4
[1:43:38] he says
[1:43:41] after these things
[1:43:43] the door was opened
[1:43:49] He said, "I heard the voice
[1:43:53] from that door
[1:43:56] in heaven.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; The voice which I have heard."
[1:44:02] In other words, if you have not heard,
[1:44:06] you'll never hear.
[1:44:12] That's what the Bible says.
[1:44:16] Those who hear my words
[1:44:20] and believe on him who sent me,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; they have got eternal life.
[1:44:29] How? Why do they hear
[1:44:32] is because they have got eternal life.
[1:44:37] They hear because
[1:44:39] they have got eternal life. are feeling.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; They hear because they have had
[1:44:48] John says
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; those who have been
[1:44:52] taught
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and heard from their father
[1:44:58] come to me.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, they were there
[1:45:04] now they are here.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; John said
[1:45:08] the the voice which I have heard
[1:45:12] never I hear in heaven
[1:45:16] but he said after these things
[1:45:20] what is these things
[1:45:23] that is seven church ages
[1:45:28] I I will come back
[1:45:34] my pastor and I
[1:45:39] we are
[1:45:42] looking
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; of things which are happening
[1:45:51] because time is normal.
[1:45:57] The Bible says people in Noah's time
[1:46:03] they were eating
[1:46:05] building
[1:46:11] taking care of nothing
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and this is what is happening in our
[1:46:16] day.
[1:46:21] People they don't take care of what is
[1:46:24] happening.
[1:46:30] I used to go to my pastor and he used to
[1:46:33] give me some things.
[1:46:39] which are taking place in our days.
[1:46:44] Noah Noah while he was building the ark.
[1:46:50] He was not ignorant.
[1:46:56] He was always looking at Enoch.
[1:47:01] The Bible says when he saw that Eno was
[1:47:04] no more
[1:47:06] he he went into the ark.
[1:47:10] He knows that something is going to
[1:47:11] happen.
[1:47:13] Why Eno is not here.
[1:47:17] Then we must always look at things.
[1:47:21] I will come back to that.
[1:47:24] But let me read something here in this
[1:47:27] book.
[1:47:30] They say it is the oncoming storm.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He's talking about someone who was
[1:47:39] careless,
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:44] who didn't take warnings.
[1:47:52] The man of God says here,
[1:47:55] I was reading,
[1:47:57] I forget just now,
[1:48:00] I believe it was in the newspaper of a
[1:48:03] storm a few years ago
[1:48:08] that was on his way across Florida.
[1:48:15] All the regions around
[1:48:19] was warned
[1:48:22] I just left there about five weeks ago
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:28] and there was a neighbor man who kept in
[1:48:31] contact with the radio all the time
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:38] because of these storms.
[1:48:41] He was a very renowned Christian.
[1:48:46] He heard that the great typhoon was
[1:48:49] coming.
[1:48:53] pisting down trees.
[1:48:56] Everyone was want to get to the safety.
[1:49:01] He thought of his neighbor
[1:49:05] who had a chicken farm
[1:49:10] and some light buildings
[1:49:13] with their chickens in them.
[1:49:17] And there and so forth
[1:49:21] where all that they had life was tight
[1:49:26] upon.
[1:49:30] in what their life was tied upon those
[1:49:32] chickens
[1:49:35] for their living.
[1:49:37] And he rushed quickly, frantically
[1:49:43] up to that gate
[1:49:45] and stopped his car and jumped out and
[1:49:49] said to this fellow, "Take all the
[1:49:52] chickens,
[1:49:54] put them in your storm shelter,
[1:49:58] and you rush over to my house
[1:50:02] because there is coming a typhoon
[1:50:05] or a storm that is going to twist
[1:50:07] everything down.
[1:50:10] And the man stood and looked at him and
[1:50:15] laughed at him and said, "Nonsense.
[1:50:19] I have heard them predict such things
[1:50:22] before
[1:50:24] and it never did happen." And the
[1:50:26] Christian neighbor was so excited.
[1:50:31] But what if it does happen?
[1:50:35] We hear remarks like that
[1:50:38] along the line. I've heard of this thing
[1:50:42] going going on
[1:50:45] that is going to happen.
[1:50:47] But it is going I tell you it is going
[1:50:49] to happen
[1:50:52] one of these days.
[1:50:54] But this man
[1:50:57] I have no time for such foolishness.
[1:51:02] I raise chickens.
[1:51:04] I have no time for such things.
[1:51:10] The neighbor said
[1:51:13] in the name of God,
[1:51:16] he said, "Leave those chickens alone.
[1:51:20] John, come quickly.
[1:51:22] You and your family. If you don't want
[1:51:25] to believe,
[1:51:27] let your family come.
[1:51:34] you don't want to come.
[1:51:37] He said if you don't want to come,
[1:51:40] just let your family come.
[1:51:43] Amen.
[1:51:45] While the storm swept through the
[1:51:46] country,
[1:51:49] it caught the chicken's house
[1:51:53] and they were found his body and they
[1:51:56] never found his body
[1:51:59] and his wife frantically fighting
[1:52:04] because
[1:52:06] the water swept and because she got her
[1:52:10] children and got them on top of the
[1:52:13] building
[1:52:16] holding on top of the chimney.
[1:52:20] There came the snake
[1:52:23] because the snake also was looking for
[1:52:25] shelter.
[1:52:28] It found them there on top
[1:52:31] and start biting them and killing the
[1:52:34] children and killing that wife. You must
[1:52:38] not forget the boot of that man was not
[1:52:42] found.
[1:52:44] Why? Because he he didn't listen to
[1:52:48] them.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; It pays
[1:52:55] to take warnings.
[1:53:03] In the days of
[1:53:06] Jesus
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; where we have read,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; they were talking with Jesus,
[1:53:17] telling him how the temple was so
[1:53:19] beautiful.
[1:53:24] He said to them,
[1:53:27] "As for these things
[1:53:30] which you behold,
[1:53:33] the days will come
[1:53:35] in which there shall not be left one
[1:53:38] stone upon another
[1:53:43] shall not be thrown."
[1:53:47] He was prophesying
[1:53:49] about the destruction of the temple.
[1:53:54] and the city.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; "Those who have listened to his warning,
[1:54:06] they were not caught in that place."
[1:54:12] Because when that time comes,
[1:54:15] they were already gone.
[1:54:18] Let me read something here for you.
[1:54:25] It it pays
[1:54:27] it pays
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; to take.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Now this Christians that had the warning
[1:54:35] of Christ
[1:54:41] was a type of the thing we are talking
[1:54:43] about this morning.
[1:54:47] This Christian that had the warning,
[1:54:50] they got out of Jerusalem
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; because he said when you see the armies
[1:54:58] encamp around you,
[1:55:02] you must get out because the time of it
[1:55:06] destruction,
[1:55:08] it has come.
[1:55:10] He said now here now wash the church. He
[1:55:14] said this Christ that had that warning,
[1:55:19] they got out of Jerusalem
[1:55:22] for they knew it was fixing to happen.
[1:55:30] Now watch the church members
[1:55:33] of the people who went to church
[1:55:37] just join the church.
[1:55:40] Why? There is armies coming there.
[1:55:43] for coming. Now let us go into the house
[1:55:47] of the Lord and pray
[1:55:51] but they are too late.
[1:55:54] You know he's talking about the prison
[1:55:56] of those days.
[1:55:59] when they see those armies.
[1:56:02] Jesus said when you see the armies you
[1:56:04] must
[1:56:07] but when they see the armies they say
[1:56:10] let's go and pray
[1:56:15] but they are too late.
[1:56:18] It didn't do a bit of good.
[1:56:22] They was watching the warning.
[1:56:26] Those disciples
[1:56:28] they were they was watching the warning
[1:56:31] what Jesus said
[1:56:34] and they escaped.
[1:56:38] In other words, it it helps
[1:56:42] to take owning.
[1:56:44] Jesus also prophesied about the signs
[1:56:48] that will precede the end time
[1:56:54] and and his second coming.
[1:56:58] He warned his disciple about the various
[1:57:00] natural disasters
[1:57:06] and the catastrophe events
[1:57:09] that will occur before the end time.
[1:57:13] In this verse
[1:57:15] where we have read 9 to 10, he spoke
[1:57:19] about wars and rumors of war
[1:57:24] and nation rising against nation,
[1:57:27] kingdom against kingdom.
[1:57:30] And in verse 11,
[1:57:32] he specifically mentioned earthquakes
[1:57:38] and fermines.
[1:57:42] Amen. We are living in those days.
[1:57:45] We have we hear rumors of wars. We hear
[1:57:49] about wars and we hear about disasters,
[1:57:53] natural disasters
[1:57:56] and we hear earthquakes,
[1:57:59] famines, pestilence, fearful signs,
[1:58:04] signs from heaven.
[1:58:07] Those are additional signs,
[1:58:10] the signs of the end time.
[1:58:15] The prophet says,
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; there is a picture. I want you to push
[1:58:20] the picture here.
[1:58:26] I don't have a pointer here.
[1:58:29] But if you see the first three and a
[1:58:32] half years,
[1:58:37] Jesus was prophesying there
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; when he said
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; the stone shall not be left upon one's.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; He was prophecying about the destruction
[1:58:55] of the city and the temple
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; and those things happen.
[1:59:04] and also our prophet here.
[1:59:07] He said, he had something about those
[1:59:09] things.
[1:59:11] Jesus was telling his disciples.
[1:59:15] Jesus was telling his disciples
[1:59:18] that they must take her.
[1:59:21] They must take care
[1:59:24] because they will hear rumors of.
[1:59:28] Our messenger here,
[1:59:31] he told us about those things also
[1:59:35] is telling us that these things will
[1:59:38] happen.
[1:59:40] Think of that. But the day that we are
[1:59:43] living in
[1:59:46] just before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:48] Christ,
[1:59:50] there will be signs in the skies
[1:59:54] and in the earth. That is our prophet.
[1:59:59] Great sight,
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; flying saucers, flying saucers,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; missiles,
[2:00:05] perplex of time,
[2:00:08] distress between nations,
[2:00:12] fearful size
[2:00:14] upon the earth and we are living in that
[2:00:19] day.
[2:00:21] In other words, this the day we are
[2:00:22] living in
[2:00:26] these things are happening.
[2:00:29] And we are seeing those things.
[2:00:34] He is warning us.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; They they serve as a vigilance
[2:00:43] and they are say they're giving us they
[2:00:45] are saying to us we must be faithful
[2:00:50] they are warning signs.
[2:00:53] In verse 28 there,
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; verse 28,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "When these things began to
[2:00:58] pass,
[2:01:00] then look up
[2:01:03] and lift up your heads
[2:01:06] for your redemption is thread."
[2:01:11] Brother Brenham also prophesied about
[2:01:13] many things
[2:01:16] and some of them happen.
[2:01:22] Many of them some of them are still the
[2:01:24] process of
[2:01:27] we mustn't just read.
[2:01:30] We must look at those things
[2:01:33] which ones have happened
[2:01:36] which ones have not happened.
[2:01:38] We must check our time.
[2:01:43] What is that video?
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to put a video there.
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Do you see that video there?
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you see the video
[2:01:59] correctly.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see that woman there?
[2:02:07] What color of a jacket is he wearing?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; He's wearing a purple dress.
[2:02:28] Our
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; prophet
[2:02:30] prophesied about that.
[2:02:36] He said
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; I won't have time in this meeting to
[2:02:41] tell you
[2:02:44] in 1933
[2:02:48] this is a woman's nation
[2:02:52] is the number 13.
[2:02:56] He's talking about America.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; It appears in the 13th chapter of
[2:03:01] Revelation.
[2:03:04] 13 stars.
[2:03:08] 13 stripes.
[2:03:11] Everything is 13.
[2:03:15] Everything is a woman.
[2:03:17] Remember, thus saith the Lord.
[2:03:22] There will be a woman.
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:26] Remember,
[2:03:28] thus saith the Lord.
[2:03:31] There will be a woman rule
[2:03:35] before the end time.
[2:03:44] Are you listening? She will either be a
[2:03:47] president
[2:03:50] or a vice president.
[2:03:55] The woman we were looking at there,
[2:03:59] what was he?
[2:04:01] What was she
[2:04:03] vice president?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; She she will either be a president
[2:04:10] or a vice president
[2:04:13] or it will be a Catholic church
[2:04:17] as a woman.
[2:04:19] But we have sin.
[2:04:23] What is that? It was a woman,
[2:04:30] not a Catholic church,
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; but a woman.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Let me read something here.
[2:04:42] Do you see that our prophet prophesied?
[2:04:46] It was just exactly what he said.
[2:04:50] He said, "Thus said the Lord.
[2:04:57] When those things happen,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; what does the Bible says?
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Lift up your heads.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But there is some people
[2:05:11] who don't care.
[2:05:20] Let me read here.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; This book is Daniel 7 weeks.
[2:05:25] Daniel 7 weeks
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; paragraph 207.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 207.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:05:31] I predicted
[2:05:35] and sat. I saw a great woman stand up,
[2:05:42] beautiful looking,
[2:05:45] dressed in a real highly royal like
[2:05:48] people.
[2:05:58] Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Show the video.
[2:06:16] What is the prophet saying here?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; What is he wearing there?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I don't say this woman is a sin. I don't
[2:06:33] say that.
[2:06:35] You say that is the the fulfillment
[2:06:39] of the prophets
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; which was prophesied
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; back there in 1933.
[2:06:50] It has just happened.
[2:06:54] What does it mean? Where are you?
[2:07:03] She was a great ruler in United States
[2:07:09] United States. It might be a Catholic
[2:07:11] church
[2:07:13] a woman but I don't know it to be the
[2:07:15] Catholic church.
[2:07:18] I can't say only thing I seen
[2:07:22] only thing I seen
[2:07:25] you see. Amen. He said he has seen
[2:07:30] I seen the woman
[2:07:33] that was allow
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; in the end time.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; He said after that
[2:07:47] I see America in depress.
[2:07:52] after this. I see America
[2:07:56] in deep
[2:07:58] and he said he said to us
[2:08:02] what Russia
[2:08:05] then when when something is is said
[2:08:07] about Russia
[2:08:10] that's why yesterday I was asking the
[2:08:12] elder there
[2:08:14] who is that president who talking there
[2:08:18] he said no now they made him a minister
[2:08:22] I wanted to hear what He was saying
[2:08:26] because when something is spoken
[2:08:30] about America,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I and my pastor,
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; we take we take look at those things.
[2:08:40] Amen.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; If I have seen him, he would have given
[2:08:44] me more things
[2:08:48] which are happening here.
[2:08:52] Amen.
[2:08:56] We have talked about mysteries. Yes.
[2:08:59] But now we want to see what is
[2:09:01] happening.
[2:09:05] And if we see what is happening,
[2:09:08] we
[2:09:10] we lift up our heads
[2:09:13] because we know our redemption
[2:09:18] has has has come near.
[2:09:27] He said
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; in 1954,
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; he prophesied about a a pope
[2:09:35] who will come out of America.
[2:09:39] Is that in that time the church will be
[2:09:42] close together
[2:09:44] and it will be with it will be cemented
[2:09:48] with love
[2:09:51] in that base.
[2:09:52] When the pope is coming out of America,
[2:09:56] it was a prophecy. The enemy now say
[2:09:59] fulfill.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Now we are looking at
[2:10:12] the church
[2:10:15] which will be cemented
[2:10:19] with love.
[2:10:22] And this man
[2:10:25] is going to be the man who will be
[2:10:27] behind that image.
[2:10:34] He will be the main driver.
[2:10:39] We know that the mechanics are already
[2:10:42] there
[2:10:44] of that image
[2:10:47] is there. The mechanics already
[2:10:51] complete.
[2:10:52] What is waiting is the driver
[2:10:57] which is the mechanics.
[2:10:59] What is going to do is going to cost a
[2:11:02] squeeze.
[2:11:05] [Applause]
[2:11:07] In other words, when we look these
[2:11:09] things,
[2:11:12] we see now
[2:11:14] this is the truth.
[2:11:20] Because it was a prophecy.
[2:11:23] Many things has happened
[2:11:25] prophesied
[2:11:27] and happened.
[2:11:34] He says, "Lift up your heads
[2:11:38] because your redemption is
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Let me read something here perhaps.
[2:11:56] It's easy
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; now with patience.
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; We have to wait for this
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; for the for the prophecies that is
[2:12:10] promised.
[2:12:13] Every one of them
[2:12:15] must be fulfilled
[2:12:18] when in this age.
[2:12:23] All right. Which age are we living in?
[2:12:26] No. No. No. Not a church.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me go on. For it forells
[2:12:38] us,
[2:12:40] the author has before done this.
[2:12:45] We are living in
[2:12:48] something like a calendar.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; You look at the calendar
[2:12:54] to find out what day of
[2:12:59] you are living in.
[2:13:01] And you look at God's Bible
[2:13:05] to see what age
[2:13:08] We are living
[2:13:11] to see the age we're living in.
[2:13:14] You must look at the Bible. The Bible
[2:13:16] will tell you in which age are you
[2:13:19] living
[2:13:24] because you will see the signs.
[2:13:31] We have seen many flying saucers.
[2:13:38] We have seen many of them
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; sometimes like all right let me find
[2:13:48] it he says we are not living in the
[2:13:50] method age
[2:13:53] the baptist age
[2:13:56] we are living in the bride age
[2:14:02] the age we are living
[2:14:04] We are living in the bride.
[2:14:08] All the prophecies
[2:14:11] must happen
[2:14:14] in this age
[2:14:16] which are pertaining to us
[2:14:21] must must happen in this age.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; The calling
[2:14:35] must finish here.
[2:14:38] Bring him back to God
[2:14:41] through the channel
[2:14:43] that he has promised to bring it back
[2:14:46] in.
[2:14:48] He promised to do it. He said
[2:14:53] those who call upon the name of the Lord
[2:14:57] shall be saved.
[2:15:00] That is the Bible. Those who call upon
[2:15:02] the name of the Lord,
[2:15:04] they shall be saved. It's not a might
[2:15:10] truth. But he said,
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; how can they call upon it if they don't
[2:15:16] know that name? How can he how can they
[2:15:19] call upon the name if they don't know
[2:15:21] it? And how can they know it? If there
[2:15:25] is no preacher.
[2:15:29] In other words, to know the name of the
[2:15:31] Lord, there must be a preacher.
[2:15:34] And he said, "How can he preach if he's
[2:15:39] not sent?"
[2:15:43] Jesus said, "As the father has sent,
[2:15:46] so I sent him.
[2:15:50] And if he sent them,
[2:15:54] he came himself."
[2:15:56] Because when his father sent him, His
[2:16:00] father came himself
[2:16:03] inside him and he said it's not me who
[2:16:08] is doing this thing is my father who is
[2:16:12] in me and if he sends us
[2:16:16] he must come and be in us.
[2:16:21] Amen.
[2:16:24] You must not forget
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; he will never send a woman.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; He will never
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:43] thus say the Bible.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Let me go on here.
[2:16:54] We are where are we brothers and
[2:16:56] sisters?
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Prophecies
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; are fulfilled.
[2:17:04] [Music]
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Let me check something.
[2:17:13] Israel.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Israel
[2:17:15] is our calendar.
[2:17:22] If you want to know
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; what time are you living in,
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; you have got a calendar
[2:17:34] and that calendar is
[2:17:41] now my church here
[2:17:44] knows that all through the years
[2:17:47] I always told you
[2:17:50] If you want to know what day of the week
[2:17:53] it is,
[2:17:56] look at the calendar.
[2:17:58] But if you want to know the time,
[2:18:04] watch those Jews.
[2:18:09] That is the only time peace
[2:18:13] God loted
[2:18:16] not certain times for the Gentiles.
[2:18:22] There was no sitting space of time.
[2:18:27] But Israel
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; has time
[2:18:31] because God has given them seven days
[2:18:39] from week number one until the seventh.
[2:18:44] is the consumation.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; If you want to know
[2:18:53] where are we living in,
[2:18:56] look at Israel.
[2:19:01] I have told you about the eastern gate
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:06] that it is about to open.
[2:19:11] I said the prophet Ezekiel
[2:19:16] said it shall be shut
[2:19:19] and it was shut and it is still shut.
[2:19:25] But now
[2:19:27] it is shivery
[2:19:31] some cracks
[2:19:35] in Israel.
[2:19:40] There are some topics in Israel
[2:19:42] nowadays.
[2:19:47] They are about
[2:19:51] they are about
[2:19:53] those people of Israel.
[2:19:56] They are about to build a third temple.
[2:20:03] You know what is the third temple?
[2:20:06] The first one
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; was called Solomon's temple.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; That is the first temple.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; And it was destroyed
[2:20:23] by the forces of Babylon
[2:20:27] led by Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Amen. The first
[2:20:34] temple was destroyed
[2:20:37] by the forces of baby
[2:20:42] led by Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:20:44] That is the first temple and restored by
[2:20:47] men like
[2:20:52] you know about that
[2:20:54] where we have read
[2:20:56] Jesus was pro Jesus was prophesied
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; about his destruction
[2:21:04] this this second temple
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; because the first one was destroyed by
[2:21:11] forces of Babylon.
[2:21:16] When Jesus was speaking here with the
[2:21:17] disciples,
[2:21:19] the disciples, the temple, the disciples
[2:21:21] was admiring
[2:21:24] it was the second temple.
[2:21:29] Are you together with me there?
[2:21:32] And Jesus said,
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; this one, it is going to be destroyed.
[2:21:39] And when I'm talking now here, it is
[2:21:42] destroyed.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; It is destroyed by the forces, Roman
[2:21:47] forces
[2:21:50] led by Titus
[2:21:52] AD70
[2:21:54] AD70.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:22:01] As I'm speaking now, in the place of
[2:22:04] that temple,
[2:22:08] there is the temple of Muhammad.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; It is built on that foundation.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:22:26] I said there is some saying
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; that now
[2:22:32] in Israel.
[2:22:33] They want to build a third
[2:22:39] because Daniel prophesied
[2:22:43] that it will be rebuilt.
[2:22:46] It will be destroyed and it will be
[2:22:48] rebuilt.
[2:22:50] That is what Daniel said.
[2:22:53] Then now they are talking about to
[2:22:57] rebuild it.
[2:23:01] And even our prophet said
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; it will be rebuilt.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; We know that
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; that it will be rebuilt.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Then um
[2:23:14] they are making ready
[2:23:19] for the rebuilding of the third temple.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Not long
[2:23:26] they were making a
[2:23:30] of the the sacrifice
[2:23:35] the sacrifice which which make the water
[2:23:40] of separation.
[2:23:45] It is the sacrifice which they sacrifice
[2:23:48] the red hiver.
[2:23:57] They've got those red hives,
[2:24:00] three of them,
[2:24:02] but they they they tried to sacrifice
[2:24:05] one
[2:24:08] to make that water
[2:24:11] because they can't start doing that
[2:24:14] temple
[2:24:17] as they as they are.
[2:24:21] be sprinkled with the water of
[2:24:22] sacrifice.
[2:24:25] When they tried to make that sacrifice,
[2:24:28] they found that this hybr
[2:24:40] disqualified me.
[2:24:46] They said we shall stand again.
[2:24:52] Why are these people doing these things?
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; I know
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; that
[2:25:01] these things of rebuilding this the
[2:25:04] temple.
[2:25:06] Put my picture there.
[2:25:13] I know these things
[2:25:15] of building the third temple
[2:25:18] which will happen there at the last
[2:25:20] three and a half years.
[2:25:24] I know we know that the building of the
[2:25:27] third temple
[2:25:30] it will be built during the third the
[2:25:33] last three and a half years.
[2:25:37] But what are these people doing? because
[2:25:40] they they already have the plan.
[2:25:44] They've already have them the articles
[2:25:47] which are which are used in the temple.
[2:25:51] They have only have those things
[2:25:55] but
[2:25:56] we know it is going to be done in the
[2:26:02] last three and a half years when the
[2:26:04] bride is not here.
[2:26:08] When this when these people are are
[2:26:11] shivering going this way and this way,
[2:26:15] it means your time is over
[2:26:22] these things. If they start they now
[2:26:25] they have a problem
[2:26:28] of that monster there
[2:26:32] which is upon the foundation.
[2:26:36] They've they they've made a a a a group
[2:26:39] of people
[2:26:42] that must discuss that
[2:26:46] this thing.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; We must build
[2:26:53] our temple.
[2:26:56] They say
[2:27:00] is going to come into this temple.
[2:27:03] The temple must be ready. The Messiah is
[2:27:06] ready to come.
[2:27:08] He must just come.
[2:27:13] He mustn't come. He will never come if
[2:27:15] our temple is not.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; But we know.
[2:27:21] Read the verse again. Isaiah chapter 6.
[2:27:38] chapter 6 verse one. Come and let us
[2:27:42] return unto the Lord, for he hath torn
[2:27:46] and he will heal us. He hath smitten and
[2:27:49] he will bind us up.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; After two days will he revive us. In the
[2:27:55] third day, he will rise us up
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; and we shall live in his sight. Then
[2:28:01] shall we know if we follow on to know
[2:28:04] the Lord, his going forth is prepared as
[2:28:07] the morning, and he shall come unto us
[2:28:11] as the rain, as the latter and former
[2:28:14] reign unto the earth.
[2:28:16] This is the prophecy prophet.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; This prophecies is the prophecy of our
[2:28:22] side.
[2:28:25] You see, when you go to burials,
[2:28:27] funerals,
[2:28:29] you find pastors trying to comfort
[2:28:32] people
[2:28:35] at those funerals.
[2:28:39] Reading this scripture, saying this, you
[2:28:42] are torn apart.
[2:28:45] God will bind you.
[2:28:49] They don't know what this scripture say.
[2:28:52] The scripture
[2:28:53] is talking about Israel.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; God was saying to the children of
[2:29:06] Israel,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; he said, um,
[2:29:11] I had turned
[2:29:16] and he will heal you.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; He hasen us.
[2:29:22] and he will bind us.
[2:29:25] He said, "Now after two days
[2:29:29] he will receive us
[2:29:32] and in the third day he will raise us
[2:29:36] up.
[2:29:39] He has already heal bind them and healed
[2:29:42] them
[2:29:45] and he has already they were scattered.
[2:29:49] He has gathered them again. In other
[2:29:53] words, he has binded them now.
[2:29:56] He has healed them now.
[2:29:58] But now we are living in death. Because
[2:30:01] when they say the second day because one
[2:30:05] day with God
[2:30:07] is 1,000.
[2:30:09] In other words, after 2,000
[2:30:13] he will raise them up.
[2:30:17] And on the third day he will make them
[2:30:20] he give them life.
[2:30:23] What is life is will give them the holy
[2:30:26] spirit.
[2:30:30] Now they are there
[2:30:32] they are healed bound.
[2:30:38] They have to be now they say at the on
[2:30:41] the on the second day we are living in
[2:30:44] the second day.
[2:30:48] We expect them
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; to be raised. To be re to raise to be
[2:30:53] revived
[2:30:56] to be raised is to be revived.
[2:30:59] They must be they must have a revival.
[2:31:03] But to have a revival
[2:31:06] there must come two prophets.
[2:31:11] Read it my brother. They just read it.
[2:31:15] I just read Revelation chapter 11, I
[2:31:19] believe. So,
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; verse three.
[2:31:30] Revelation 11:3.
[2:31:34] And I will give power unto my two
[2:31:36] witnesses
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; and they shall prophesy 1,23
[2:31:41] score days
[2:31:43] in sec.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; This he said I will give power unto my
[2:31:48] tweet
[2:31:51] witnesses
[2:31:53] is Moses and Elijah.
[2:31:56] He said they will prophesy
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; 2000
[2:32:03] 200360
[2:32:10] that is 360 three and a half years are
[2:32:14] you together with me in other words when
[2:32:17] the bread goes
[2:32:21] these two witness will come
[2:32:24] because they will start the last three
[2:32:27] and a half years.
[2:32:29] It start by them. When the bride goes
[2:32:32] up, they come down. They start to
[2:32:35] preach. They the one who will raise
[2:32:38] them,
[2:32:40] they will raise these children of Israel
[2:32:43] because he said on the third day, on the
[2:32:45] second day, I will raise them.
[2:32:50] Then these two,
[2:32:52] they will revive them. The message of
[2:32:55] these two will revive them. Then after
[2:32:59] they are revived, they will receive the
[2:33:01] Holy Spirit because he said on the third
[2:33:04] day, I will give them life.
[2:33:08] Now we are living in the day where they
[2:33:12] can be raised
[2:33:17] because we are living after
[2:33:20] after this the second day. Amen.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; We are we are going to the third day
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; where he will give them life.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; The message of these two
[2:33:36] will give them life.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; For for us
[2:33:47] to get the message,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded.
[2:33:55] For them to get the message,
[2:33:57] you must be blinded.
[2:34:00] The Gentiles must be blinded.
[2:34:04] When they are blinded, then the message
[2:34:06] will go back.
[2:34:08] And they are already blinded.
[2:34:15] I was saying to the children of God
[2:34:19] to hear the word
[2:34:22] it depends on the capacity
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; because
[2:34:29] 2 liter container.
[2:34:33] It takes only two liter water.
[2:34:38] If you can try to pour three liter,
[2:34:42] it will overflow
[2:34:44] to to hear the word. It depends on the
[2:34:47] capacity.
[2:34:49] That's why Lutherans
[2:34:53] during the time of Luther
[2:34:55] they could they could only carry
[2:35:00] capacity
[2:35:02] of the just shall live by faith.
[2:35:08] But when you try to put scientific
[2:35:12] overflows
[2:35:15] in our time now,
[2:35:18] there are some people who their capacity
[2:35:21] can only carry.
[2:35:25] God has sent us a prophet.
[2:35:29] They can carry
[2:35:33] from there. It overflows.
[2:35:38] When you tell them about the revelation
[2:35:42] 10 verse one,
[2:35:46] when you tell them about that one, you
[2:35:48] say, "Hey, you will confuse people."
[2:35:51] Do you mean the Holy Ghost is not more?
[2:35:55] What do you mean? Because it overflows
[2:35:59] [Music]
[2:36:03] their capacity.
[2:36:05] is food.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; They could they cannot receive any more.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Let us close our eyes.
[2:36:21] [Applause]
[2:36:28] Mighty heavenly father,
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; thank you for this
[2:36:35] message.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; We have seen,
[2:36:41] we have fret.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:44] When messages were given, sometimes
[2:36:48] Satan will try to
[2:36:51] make you to
[2:36:54] say something which is not the right
[2:36:56] thing.
[2:37:00] But we pray heavenly father
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; that if some things which are like that
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; which have ever came out of my mouth,
[2:37:13] Let them not get into your children's
[2:37:15] hearts.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; Let only those things which are from you
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; get into your children's hearts.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; We're living in the last days.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; This is the final.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; The marriage is about to
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; the the last call of the re
[2:37:42] is about to rain.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, these messages
[2:37:51] are those which will make the bride
[2:37:55] ready.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; He says a brick upon a brick
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; building us to the place
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; where we can
[2:38:12] know who we are
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; because you said the time the bride
[2:38:17] knows who they are
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; the rapt shall take place
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; help us Lord as we are here
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; as we go step by step
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; help us to move with you
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; we pray
[2:38:39] if there is anyone No one here has come
[2:38:41] here
[2:38:43] not knowing
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; you know each and everyone's hearts
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; and we know what we need.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Heavenly father when we move from this
[2:38:55] house going to our different places.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Be with us I pray.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; The precious name of our Lord and Savior

[3:02:19] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:02:22] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:02:24] same Jesus whom he hath crucified, both
[3:02:28] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:02:31] this, they were pricked in their heart
[3:02:34] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[3:02:36] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[3:02:39] shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,
[3:02:42] "Repent and be baptized every one of you
[3:02:45] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[3:02:47] remission of sins, and ye shall receive
[3:02:49] the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[3:02:52] For the promise is unto you and to your
[3:02:55] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:02:58] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:03:00] call.
