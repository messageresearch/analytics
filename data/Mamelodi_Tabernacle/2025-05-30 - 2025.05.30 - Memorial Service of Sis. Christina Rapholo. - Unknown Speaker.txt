[Music] I greet the children of God this afternoon. in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Um while we are standing on our feet, let's open the book of Revelation. We are going to read Revelation chapter 21. Here we are going to read from verse 1 to 6. Revelation 21 1-6. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I made all things new. And he said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, it is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the waters of life freely. Let's read the book of Isaiah chapter 66. We read verse um 13. Isaiah 66, chapter 66, Jesiah 66, verse 13. Verse 13. As one whom his mother comforth, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. Let us lift our eyes as we pray. My dear heavenly father, this is the privilege again you have privileged us with to stand in front of this group of people here being your children in this time in this situation which they are in. Yes. because someone they loved so much has left them. We are standing here coming with your word because you said the word is the only comfort there is. Come Lord be with us. comfort us all with your word as we pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. We may take our seats. Uh as usual um we are not going to be too long. Um when things like this happen, we have to know where we are. We have to know what we should do. We have to know what happened after this. I've got the very short topic. The topic is the place of rest, peace and comfort. the place of rest, peace, and comfort. living here on earth. When you read the book of Proverbs, [Music] chapter 9 verse 5, it says, "Everyone knows that he's going to die." Everyone knows that he's going to die. And when we read the book of Jeremiah chapter 8 verse4, chapter 8 verse14, it says we must gather together and run to the fortified cities, strong cities. So, so that we can go and die there because we know we are going to die. We must know where we should die at. Um DM chapter 18 verse 10. Chapter 18:10 it says the name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The Russians run into it because you are going to die. You must know where you can run to. He says the name of the Lord. is a mighty tower where the Russians run into it and they are saved. It says the righteous. It don't say any person but it says the righteous run to it. Then when we follow this rashes we go back we find that God said to Moses he who take one's eye this eye must also be taken he who cut somebody's ear his ear must also be cut. Then they found that There is somebody who has taken someone's eye but not deliberately. But because the law says his eye must be taken up. He had to go there and his eye must be taken up. Then God said to Moses, "Go and build a house of refuge." the houses of refugees. And then when somebody has done wrongly, not willingly, he must run to that city. We are following the way the Russ says the Russ is the is the Russ who runs into it. That's why the houses of refugees. It was for the Russians. If for those who have done not willingly when you rush there, you find that there is the first gate. The people who want to revenge they stand. They when you enter at the first gate they stand at the outside the gate then in the in in there you are going to find the priest there who have got the revelation who have got the discernment you must present your story that I was throwing a stone perhaps I was want to kill the bait but unfortunately the stone hit that man in the eye and he took that man's eye. Then when they are listening to you they can they can find that you are talking the right thing then they will open the the second gate. Then when you get in the second gate then you are saved. Then you are going to stay there until the death of the high priest is then when you will you are going to be released. But if they find that your story is not the truth, not the Russians, they take you back to the Avengers, then you are your eye must be taken off. That's why the people who runs there is the people who have done wrong not willingly. That's why the Bible says the Russians runs there. and they are saved. Then when we read the book, let's read the book of Isaiah, my brother. Isaiah chapter um I'm going to tell you Isaiah chapter uh 35. Isaiah chapter 35 verse 8 to 10. Verse 8 to 10. and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those who way fearing men. Just just stay there. They say the highway shall be there and the way and then the in this way the unclean shall not pass over there. In other words, the unrighteous shall not this place and the the the cities of refuge and the the name of the Lord. It seems to be the same place because there are only the Russians who must pass there. And when the read the Bible goes on, and a highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those wayfairing men. Those fools shall not therein, though fools shall not therein. Go back. Go for further. No lion shall be there. You see, no lion shall be found there. No ravenous beast shall shall be found there. But that place is only for the Russians. It is the place of peace. It's the place of rest. It is the place of comfort. The name of the Lord is the place of peace, is the place of rest, and is the place of comfort. And the highway is the not the way, is the place of peace, is the place of comfort, and is the place of rest. The Bible says here it is for the righteous. It is for the redeemed if you are not the redeemed you don't belong to that place. That place which is the place of peace, which is the place of rest, which is the place of comfort, is for the righteous, is for the redeemed. And if you are a redeemed because redeem it means to bring back to the original and the redeemed are written in the book of redemption. only the redeemed are qualified to be there. They are also the the ones who are qualified to be the children of God. They are only also the only people qualified who are qualified to run into the the name of the Lord. What is the name of the Lord? Before we get there, the redeemed their place is the way, not the highway. Because the highway has many people in it, but the way because is a highway in the middle there. There is a way and in that middle road it is only for a few people and those few people they are called the redeemed and the redeemed are written in the book of redemption and the book of redemp the Bible says here you are sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of redemption. And when is the day of redemption? The day of redemption is when were open. When the things of were opened, it was the day of [Music] redemption. When the book was taken and it when it was opened, it was taken and opened and that day it was the day of redemption. But when Jesus come with the open book, he's coming to claim his own not to redeem them. Because through seven churches, he was a lamb. He was a mediator. He was doing a redemption redemptive work. Then when the the redemptive work is over, he stood up. He's he he changes to from a lamb to a lion. And when he is a lion, it means he's the king. He is our king now. And he took the book. When he is the king and he come back with the book in the book there were names there and the names the names of the redeemed. The redeemed are those who are in the place of rest. When they pass here when they die from here, when we say they are dead, they are not dead. They are sleeping. They are going to rest. And they they have gone to the place of rest. And they have gone to the place of comfort. to be comforted. The redeemed when he when he's coming he was coming with a book and in that book there were the redeemed he he he was coming to claim. Amen. Amen. those whom he has redeemed through 8. Are you together with him? We know he came in three sons name. He was the son of man, the son of God and the son of David. The son of man is Jesus Christ. We know. He said, "Who do men say I the son of man?" He called himself the son of man. Then through the seven church ages, God was building his church because he built that church through seven spirits which is seven stars. And that was the time of the son of God. When he was the son of God, he was a lamb. He was a mediator between man and God. And at the end there come to Luke 17:30. But Jesus said, "When the son of man is revealed, the son of man says, the son of man will be revealed." Are you together with me? Jesus was the son of man. He said when the son of man is it means he means he's going to be revealed again. It means he is coming again. He is the son of man. man is going to at the end of the gentile then he's at the end at the end of the son of God must be revealed again that is the that is the dispensation we are living in if you can say the son of man is not revealed then you Don't believe that God has sent us a prophet because the the son of man is revealed. He revealed himself through the prophet. Then there is no more time that we can wait that the son of man is still going to be revealed because he has revealed himself already through the prophet. Because God cannot do anything be before he can before he send the prophet. In other words, before God can do something prophet, before he can take the book, he must send the book. Before he can tell us what are seven thunders, he must take the book. If I can tell us what beast what this beast is, he must send a prophet. If I can tell us who is this false prophet, he must send a prophet. This place is for the redeemed. He said the name of the Lord is a mighty tower. the Russians because we know we are going to die. We must run to the place of rest and comfort because we are living in this body but we are not this body. When this body's time has has has expired. But you you must have a place of rest. This body one of the good days it's going to be is going to expire. The Bible says we know they're going to die. But a person inside is not going to die. But when he moves from this one, because when you are sick, sickness is the sign of the wall creaking. In other words, the wall of your house which you are in is creaking little by little. When you when you feel pain, That wall is creaking. That wall is creaking. Then until when you look at the wall, you find this wall has many character on me. Then you you get out of when you get out of the house, people say you are dead. No, you are not dead. You have seen that this house is is has expired going to fall on me to get out. But when you get out of this, you must go to a place of peace and rest where you are going to be comforted. Isaiah says here, "You will be comforted like a person who is comforted by his mother, but you'll be comforted in Jerusalem." Jerusalem. Comfort is in Jerusalem. The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. I will come back here. Jerusalem. Jerusalem. We have got the Jerusalem which is the type of the heavenly Jerusalem and the heavenly Jerusalem here as we are living when we read the book of Hebrews chapter 12 and um I I don't know I want water. But let's read the book of Hebrews chapter 12 12 verse ah brother they will they will try to fetch water. Amen. Verse 21 12. Amen. And so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear. Hebrews chapter 12. Yes. One. All right, start from verse 22. Let's see. 22. But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, the the Jerus the earthly Jerusalem, Jerusalem types the heavenly Jerusalem. And the heavenly Jerusalem, as Paul is telling us here, He was telling the Hebrews and he's telling us that you have come into that city the heavenly Jerusalem. In other words, the church, the bride because the angel said to John, "John, I'm going to show you the bride, the lamb's wife." When John went out to see the lamb's wife, the new city, he sent him from heaven. The city is the is the wife of the lamb, the the the church, the bride is Jerusalem. Jerusalem. Amen. Amen. And then Jerusalem which is the bride is the body of Christ. Then when they say the the name of the Lord is a mighty tower it means the body because the name is Jesus Christ. The name of the Lord is Jesus. It's the Lord Jesus Christ. When they say the name of the Lord is a mighty name, it means the name the Lord Jesus Christ to that name. Then you will find peace, rest and comfort. Jesus said, "Come unto me. If you are tired, he will give you rest. He said he is the rest. Then when you get to him, then you find the rest. The the name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The Bible says Jesus is the head and the church is the body. In other words, the head and the body is one. In other words, the church is Jesus Christ because you can't have Jesus the head. If the head is Jesus, then the Buddh is Jesus. That's why Paul when he's starting to build a church the church of the from the Gentiles he said I am going to call people for God's name in other words those people who will come they will be in in the name of the Lord in other words their names will be Jesus Christ is the body of the Lord. Jesus said this his church is his body and his body is they say you run into the house and that house is a mighty town and that house is the Lord Jesus Christ. His church is his house. And if you run to his church, his house, are you together with us here? Amen. Then he his his church here. If you if you are one of the redeemed, his church is formed by his redeemed. If you are his redeemed part of his church and to be part of his church, you must be born again. And to be born again, all right. Amen. Are you together with me? To be born again, you must receive the seat. Seat and the seat travels through the body. The seat from God came to Phillip which is the body which is part of the body. Philillip Philip which is part of the body carried the seat to the unic and there was birth there because the seed came there. through Philip. The Bible says you are born again through the living seat which is the word of God. In other words, birth comes through the word and Bible says how can he preach. In other words, we cannot know his name because he says those who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved because the name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run into call upon the name of shall be saved. He says now how can they call upon if there is no picture? How can he preach if there is no if he is not sent? That's why when he's building his church through seven church agents he had seven messengers we shall call seven spiritual that's why the Bible says how can they how can they preach if they are not sent and the prophet said these seven messengers are making God known to the people. In other words, you cannot know God if there is no messenger that these messengers came to make God known to us. How can they preach if they are not sent? He said as the father has sent me so I send you in each and every age there were messenger there was a messenger in this age under that messenger let me tell you God predestinate these seven church ages when he's calling the gentile church which is the new Jerusalem when he's when he's building his church which is the new Jerusalem he used seven messenger and in each messenger they were predestinated pastors Because this messenger is a predestinated messenger and under this predestinated messenger predestinated and under this predestinated pastor predestinated sheep. [Applause] [Music] There won't be a pastor if there are no sheep because he is a shepherd. How can he be a shepherd if there are no sheep? Amen. Because the Bible says in the olden time when when they were branding the sheep, they were the the brand they were branding the sheep. The mark they were putting on. They were putting also in the hand of the shepherd. In other words, the mark in the sheep must appear also in the hand In other the the sheep the sheep and the shepherd are one they've got the same mark. If this sheep cannot follow the shepherd means it is not part of this ministry of this shepherd. The B the prophet says leave it because it is a goat and God has predestinated these seven church agent this messenger will call this people. He knew the number of them. He knew their names. because their names were in his in that book of redemption. Your names were there. When he was sitting there with a book in his hand, your names were there. knew this this group of names this this messenger will be responsible for this group. So under this messenger will be these pastors who will be taught faithfully from this take from the messenger pass it to the sheep. In whatever the sheep are hearing, the messenger has said, they hear what the messengers have said. They recognize God. The pastors must must recognize God in the messengers. the sheep. My god in their past because when as as my my elder said, if you accepted the word of God, the word of God in you makes you a minor God. That's why the sheep in Paul's style the Paul says they glorified God in me. Perhaps if it was during this time what is this pastor saying we glorified God in him. We are leaving him. But Paul said they glorified God. He has seen them glorifying God and glorifying God in him. That's why they could come with handkerchiefs and put them on the boot of Paul and go back home and put them in the sick people because they have identified in this man. People who fail to identify God, they are the one who stand in the way of those who see God because they don't have eyes to see. When you see they say you don't see they think you are like them. The Bible said where we have read, he said I I saw the city and I saw a new heaven and a new earth. So the first heaven and the first earth away there was no more sin. That's why why why there will be no mercy? Because Satan will never be there. He he operate in the sea because the sea will be no more. He will never be there. Where will he operate? The Bible says and I so the city the new Jerusalem coming down from God because you are joys and spiritual and the church of God is both physical and spiritual when we see you here you are somewhere when you come together that's why the prophet says when you come to the service your theophan is come take the place there you must move you you must move with the message because the word of God is a seat because the seat in it has got life in it when Put it down there. It will it must germinate. When it germinate it it it look it does not look like the seed you have planted but it is the same seed. But if you don't know you never know that this is the seed but it's another dispensation of the same seat. The life of the seed is in that it will move until it comes to the seat again. We are living at the sea time. We are not living in a blade time or shak age but we are living in the sea. When the seat has come No more rain is needed. Even even the the farmers they will try to destroy clouds. When they see the clouds they try to destroy because the seed has come. What is needed there? The shack the sun there. The the the function of the sun is to bend the shack so that the shark can open itself. So that the seat can come in contact with the people leave you is because they are the shark. They must leave so that you must stand in in in the presence of the shark. I saw the city, the new Jerusalem. It's the city Abraham was looking for. He saw that city there. He thought it was somewhere. He was moving from country to country looking for this city which is the city of [Music] rest the city of rest peace and comfort because in verse four here and God shall wipe away all tears. You must go to that city so that you can sleep there. When you sleep, you must sleep at that city in that name because the this city is the bride of Jesus Christ and the bride of Jesus Christ as the name of his husband because the name of the husband is taken by the wife. The wife acquired the name of his husband. And the the name of Jesus is with the bride. He says here when you die, you must die in that city. You must die in that body. You must die in that house because the church is the house is the body of Jesus Christ. He is the head when you die there. I said to to to be the member you must be born again. But if you are not born again, you will die twice. You understand? When I say you die twice, I say you die twice because you are born dead then you you are living dead. until you die. Your last death is at the white throne judgment is the second death. The first death is when you are born. You are dead. When you move outside of this body, you are not dead. You are dead when you separate with God. Because by birth, separated with God, there is no life in you because life is God. Let's stand [Applause] up. Let's close our eyes. Mighty heavenly father, the father of our lord Jesus Christ, we are here, we have seated down and listened to the word. We know always when a word is preached, Satan sometimes wanted to find the corner where he can throw something which is not from you. But always we believe that because these are your children only what is from you is what will stay and find the place in their soul. We are going to get out of this place go to our different places to go and rest a bit. Be with the family. Be with them. You are the savior. Paul said, "You are the comforter." He said to the people, "We will comfort you with the comfort we were comforted with. We are trying to comfort these people with the comfort God has comforted us with. Be with them. Comfort them with your word. We pray, Father. We know what we are asking. You have already known that we are going to ask it. You have just waited for us to utter them with our mouth. We have uttered them. Lord, bring it. We pray. We pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. [Applause] Um Jeremiah. Hallelujah. How many believe that we are in the right place? Amen. Under the right ministry. Amen. And then under the predestinated pastor. Amen. Our pastor, we are comforted. [Music] Amen. So tomorrow our service. Amen. So location and then extension 10 address when we've got this kind of a service.
