uh we are going to have one part of it this morning and we'll see if we can again set another day for the second part of it as I've got some material from even from Pastor Roni amen um the DVD material and I will still have to uh uh search this some other things concerning now this time now you know of the message um the modern events made clear by prophecy events made clear by prophecy now as prophetic people we are blessed uh to live in this times of the Fulfillment of propes and it takes prophetic people to hear and understand these things so let's just open our hearts because um that's why we know when is the rupture as we read here in the we we didn't talk about the day of the Rapture the hour of the Rapture but when [Music] amen amen and let's turn to let's read Ezekiel 38 ver1 to7 Ezekiel 38 ver1 to7 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face again go the land of mog the chief Prince of mishak and tubah and prophesy against him and say thus said the Lord God behold I'm against thee oh go the chief Prince of mishak and tuba and I will turn thee back and put WS into thy jaws and I'll bring thee forth and all thy Army horses and hors man all of them clothed with all sorts of armor even a great company with buckles and shs all of them handling swords Persia Ethiopia and Libya with them all of them with shield and helmets GMA and All His Hands the house of Tu of the north quar and all the bands and many people with thee be thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a god unto them I think I believe that uh some have got their own Bible and uh have read out of their Bibles you may be seated now now now we we have some events leading to um the white Throne judgment starting with the Gathering of the bride of Christ chosen from Seven Church ages I think one time we read about it I was in my when they asked me where do you get this thing I said in the in the spoken word spoken with I was reading about the seven battle lines uh because the prophet says each and every messenger comes and sounds his trumpet that is calling for a battle just as the Lord said I I will build my church Upon This Rock the gates of head shall not Prevail over it and uh so you know the battles are fought at the gate so that's why we have a seven Gates so every Minister comes he sounds it's a a call to [Music] battle so how many do we have we we have seven amen so we we we have this seven Gates amen amen now uh if you read we won't read now we'll see next time but your book uh the greatest ever fought the prophet says God's been selecting out of every church then after selection then that place remains a denomination and he selects out uh the prophet calls them uh uh he call after selection he he speaks of the size of the [Music] Overcomers now these people selected out of each Church age is the arm of God and that is the prophetic that is going to fight the battle ofed they were trained and selected and armed for for a special task and and Revelation chapter 19 says he shall come with them on horses he will gather them from the four quarters of Heaven it is in the seals book amen he he will gather them from the four quarters of Heaven for to to fight he'll come down uh we we'll pass we'll see some of these things as we proceed next now go and MOG go means Prince and means his his land amen amen and if we read in the Bible we realize that Genesis chapter 10 if I can open Genesis chapter 10 here um verse one now here are the generations of the sons of noem him and just jaff and unto them were Sons born After the flood the sons of jaff GMA and the MOG and the m and jaffin and tubal and mishak and Tyrus and the sons of now all these names Tokar you read verse three speaks of G ashim and tokara actually you find them in Russ most of the towns there of Russia but there's a town town I think it's called Toki in Russia they say it's named after tubal and we have M here which the historian says mosc and then you have H tokam all those names you you find them you you find them name you find the towns in Russia named after this names even amen amen so now but uh the thing is here now this will happen after the Rapture now when we finish you'll see how how close is the rupture amen this this may is a Time piece to us for the the the the word said when you see these things starting to happen beginning beginning to to to to happen know that it's the time amen amen amen now um this is after the Rapture during the tribulation period with is three and a half years because Rome [Music] um the best let me read it I read the book of what is Sals 518 518 uh after the Rapture I read this part here brother Bram you said that Rome would take the government of the Jews at the last three and and a half years that is during tribulation it will be the last three and 1 half years that's right not the first because it's already passed seven weeks seven weeks [Music] Messiah was cut short and then remained another three and a half amen amen now he says now during this last three and a half during the the calling of the Jews the the tribulation period the time of the Beast because when the bride goes the Satan takes his seat at amen amen and uh you know at Vatican there that's when that dictator what do you call that Italian dictator Marcon so he signed a treaty with we signed with the Pope there on one of the Seven Hills of Rome which is H I think it's the seventh Hill where where they signed that that piece of ground as we call Vatican today is independently under the Church Rome now that's why the Bible speaks of the Cities we have Jerusalem the city we have Vatican the city so Jerusalem is the city of God Vatican is the city of Lucifer so you see both cities we have this woman and the one that sth on there and then we have another woman which is the bride of Christ so you see these cities this women and so forth then we have the prophet here Mal 4 Revelation 10:7 all those scriptures and we have another Prophet here the Beast amen amen so now this one appears uh after the [Music] Rapture which is the Beast you haven't seen anything of the Beast they they will see it after the Rapture that's the that the prophet says um in whatever you are doing don't go that way amen because after the Rapture there is no God has taken his spirit amen and the only Grace that remains is for the Jews because that's when 144,000 will be called out 144,000 Jews by Moses and Elijah now um you have said many times that communism was raised by God to serve his purpose as like King Nebuchadnezzar now where did Communism fit into the picture um that will finally do how does it wind up many scholars believe that in the Kingdom of the north go and MOG mentioned in the scriptures goes down against Israel you know Satan even in the Bible he has chosen North the north part did you read that in the Bible Satan himself he wanted to establish his kingdom in the north it is even in your books your Cod where the Prophet says you see he wanted to outshine the Creator he wanted to make a better Kingdom than that of the creator but where in the north now God and may God comes is coming from the north parts as even in the prophecies that were given out the third was it the third one watch Russia watch Russia King of the North uh you'll check it and make make sure but I think it's the the thought vision and what was the seventh the prophet says I say the prophet says I saw a smok explosion that was America okay amen I will remind you of these things the Lord will now that communism will finally destroy Catholicism vtic by explosion now we've got a m material when we were on our way to Queen we uh happen to be at the brother's house uh with brother Ron and we were shown this part where Russian generals drunk Russian generals and they saying uh they don't understand why they should not bomb America so now uh the prophet says it will take like a mad man or like a drunk to press that button to press that button you you see Russia Russia Russia is not interested in some uh conflict like Iran and I mean Iraq no God prepared Russia for a special thing at the end of time just like he prepared nebz punish Israel is amen amen nebuchad was a Believer but God prepared him militarily and so forth just to punish his people amen amen so the prophet now says finally communism is referring to Russia because the Bible says that is from he will come from the north path the the at North which is Russia amen amen and um uh let me go back to the scriptures so and I quote again I think the book Daniel 7 weeks 7 weeks of Daniel um where is it now page 39 yeah9 um I will read this part here is that the part all right uh it's talking of the the spreading of the Roman power to conquer all the Sleeping Visions Jews and so forth and they will break the Covenant in the middle of the week did you know last time the pope went to Isel okay amen so Rome is already working on that um relationship he wants to have with Israel [Music] all right amen because it's leading to that and even I read that in in in Palestine or in Israel uh preparations are being made uh the old ruins are being um what's name Resto restored [Music] they're looking for the old places even the the attire used to be used by the um priests and so [Music] forth they they're looking for all those things and um um at the place called The Valley Of jel that's where the Battle of shall be uh fought fought it is called the valy ofo and uh now we are not talking about a myth here listen we are talking about something that will take place very soon when we were now uh uh these days I will let me read to you this first uh he will break during the the last three and a half years Rome do you know in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ uh Israel was under Rome Rome is now because the Messiah is coming back to the Jews Rome is going there and Moses and Elijah are going [Music] there now it's going to be a conflict again amen amen but the prophet says Moses and Elijah will give them a hard time until finally they are killed then Rome will break the the the relationship [Music] ship amen amen that's when terrible things now but now our theme is on the King of the North amen amen now I read uh if you're not sleeping my brother you may write these things down and read them at home I should have C rather than seals C is seals somebody can get volume 2 while we are proceeding now Ezekiel we've got go and make of Ezekiel God bless and I think brother has tried something for us here means means his eel prophecy 615 theel is coming from the north parts Ezekiel 38:1 to 5 Ezekiel 38 all those scriptures referring to the same thing it's Russia King of the North against Israel after the Rapture now you have another go and MOG that is in the Book of Revelation now this go and meog comes at the end of the Millennium go this one is not from the atus North but is from the four quarters of the earth that is Revelation 20:7 11 and Seven Seals page 513 to 514 if you can find them you can always come back right amen so because go and meog it's not a name here it means Prince and [Music] his that's why you have go of Ezekiel and you have go of Revelation the book of re which just means Prince and his now here he appears as Satan here is Satan in the Book of Revelation Ezekiel is a political leader but that is Russia and Russia is right now preparing for that are you listening Russia is preparing to fulfill this prophecy not not tomorrow this morning when we were in Malawi brother Ron in the morning he switch on for the news now now when we met he said to me uh you know the news this morning uh they say Russia Russia uh has placed some about 600 missiles [Music] inan Russia Russ okay now why why because you know these days there's been this uh um talk about America wanting to stop Iran from making a nuclear bomb those who follow these things they know what I'm talking about amen amen amen so um it's happening right now even the new Obama he he inherits the same problem they have with [Music] Iran IR is developing a bomb nuclear bomb amen amen the bomb we are talking about has never ever ever or it was never at any time used now some uh they have seen the the DVD um the last the final chapter chapter so we pity those who who are not interested in those things the Final Chapter they are not aware of times it is like in the days of Noah amen amen so even today one says I don't watch DVD I don't read papers I don't read that that doesn't make you a better Christian we we we need information [Applause] [Music] I've seen my Prophet searching these things watching the news reading the papers my Prophet amen so as a minister he goes around he he is sensitive to the times now as a minister he needs information in whatever manner he can get it to come and to warn the people amen amen so these things the things you are going to read about are happening right now the prophecy of Ezekiel is now being fulfilled only it will be finally H it will be finalized after the Rapture when the bright is gone but we are just looking at the kitten ra amen amen the name Iran formerly Persia was changed from Persia to Iran in 1935 1935 and a treaty between Moscow and Persia was [Music] signed um that was in 19 322 they signed a treaty just like M and the pope signed for a Vatican City on the hill of Rome that's where when he the Devil comes down we are we are looking for the new city to come that City will come and there is another city and the devil will come down you will come down on that hill we have Seven Hills this side the bride has seven heels and we have S Roman Hills uh I won't uh go that but we've got the names uh I gave you the names of the hills the Seven Hills of Rome amen amen and we have the Seven Hills on our side leading to the desert that standing in the Gap amen amen to a continental divide Seven Hills so God showed him Seven Hills and the prophet saw seven heels Seven Seals all those things amen exactly yes br that's now now listen the name Pia was changed to Iran 1935 but in I think October 1932 Moscow which is Russia signed a treaty with Iran what what what was it for stating that [Music] in the event of the uh Soviet War or Russian war Russia [Music] war in the event of a Russian war the Russia will be allowed to pass without resistance to pass through Iran because Russia broke TI with Israel and they said it openly that they are going to destroy Jerusalem I Shar this with brother some years back it appeared on a magazine Russia saying we are going to blow up Israel now the eye of Russia is on America and [Music] Israel amen this conflicts like Iran and what what Russia is not there it's noted as the prophet says God prepared him for a certain purpose that's to punish both Rome America and all this who rejected amen amen that's why he says he saw America Going Up in Smoke okay now now now uh the way to Jerusalem their war path goes through Iran the King of the North he has to come through Iran so that's why they signed a treaty 19322 because it was already in the heart of the King of the North amen amen so a treaty now I read something here so in the second world war German troops were stopped trying to March into Iran why they were stopped it's because H the prophecy said it's go King of the North who will possess those Gates not Germany amen amen now now we we'll read some of these things um I was opening this one although brother reflected them there so if you want to follow these things you can read it at home now will Ezekiel 38 and 39 come to pass before the Rapture that's a question now if you'll notice that's the answer if you'll notice eel 3839 deals with Gog and MOG which is Russia that's the prophet speaking amen Mal the North Country amen amen H I do not say that this is correct amen amen what do you say but to my way of teaching it comes to pass after the Rapture now we say Amen to that today amen so the prophet is correct amen that's to my way of teaching it after the church is taken up and God deals with Gog and MOG when they come down before Israel there and I I think that will come to pass after the Rapture amen amen and the bright says God bless you amen now I want to read you from the testimony of the Jews themselves now these things will happen after the Rapture the Bride of the gentle bride is [Music]
