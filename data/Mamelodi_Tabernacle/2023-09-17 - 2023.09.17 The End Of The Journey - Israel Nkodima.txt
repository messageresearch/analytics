Description:
Title:The End of The Journey. Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 17 September 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

Pastor reads: Gen 14:18-20  Rev 22:8-9

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience that we are at the end of the Journey.

When you see Melchisedec you must know that you have reached the end of the Journey.

We as the children of God, when we come to the service we come for the promised word. Believing the word of God is not from the mind. Our ministry comes after the opening of the seventh seals. You can only worship an eternal God if you have eternal life. 

Before you worship God, He comes to you and make himself known to you, so that you will continue to worship the God you know.
God must be in your heart because you can not worship the God you do not know and God is not a rumor.

Unless God is in you, you will never do anything right. Before you serve God you must know the nature of God, then you will know how to serve him.

Getting where Melchisedec is, is to get where the prophet is. When God is in you, you do not struggle to  live and to be a child of God. All the revelations of God came through the seventh seal. If we have not received the seventh seal then we have not met God, because it reveals God and also reveals you. Coming to church is to serve under the word preached by God’s prophet.

65-0221E Who Is This Melchisedec Par 30-33, 68 & 123

you can't go further than this video amen amen amen Young right amen but let us take it from here firstly I will read from Feast of the trumpets of the trumpets but before I read it there are things here that are happening of which I was thinking that by God's grace uh I'm going to read some things foreign [Music] but I'm going to take the message you know did you hear when we are talking about these things we are talking about underworld yeah okay amen now Joel I'm going to read the global things not today the law is in the court and then after reading the church will tell me whether brother Brennan is preaching and the world or the word of God but I'm going to read and he will tell us what are words of witches and what he experienced how he was attacked he will show us he preached less you don't know what is we've been preaching here and then last week we went preaching videos [Music] foreign is the prophet preaching underworld okay we'll see but I'm going to keep time because it is not your fault it is just something that happened the whole night without lies that's number one I mean but we thank God that they fixed they think this morning and they told us what actually happened all right let's look at this I'm reading from this book of the trumpets and page 15. okay Abraham Abraham and Sarah we're looking for a coming son a promised Sun Moon Isaac healing Isaac right amen you know we as the children of God if we come to the city we come for the promised word amen we don't just take things at random it should be something amen that God has promised you know if you take seed everything is in that thing is life for pillow the life of the Creator it's in that City amen amen now if planted is Rich it brings forth actually the promises that were planted in Italian believe in the word of God it's not from your mind because you are a seed obey now God has planted in that City the law of growth amen amen and we are told that when the seed is planted it is a soil foreign [Music] all right amen you know now like you are like in the field okay I mean now let me read to you this Abraham and Sarah were looking for a coming son a promised son earlier that's why I'm saying here this is the end of the journey God had appeared in many forms like even to us he appeared in many forms but we are now left with one foreign then he spoke to Abraham Abraham and by Voices just before the coming Sun arrives either now we've been through it I'm just rehearsing to get this to you that he might change the body of Abrams that he changed the body of Abraham immediately [Applause] he changed their bodies notice the last sign that they got yeah before the sun arrived was Jehovah talking to them in the form of a man [Applause] in the form of a man and how they knew this was Jehovah because he said just a few days before God has changed his name okay now we'll start here that's how that's why I say the end of the journey and let's start now since the opening who is this is amen okay I will read from foreign probably it it reads who is this man amen [Music] theologians has had different ideas but since the opening of their sales you know our ministry comes through the seals amen our ministry comes after the opening of the seventh series the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us all the Mysteries that are that's been through the age of the reformers the reformers is supposed to be brought into view [Music] by the angel of the last Church age um that's it I mean I skipped to this one and the person he's talking about this man this man this person is [Music] now if you worship an eternal God that means you can do that only if you have eternal life if you don't have eternal life was a feeling you cannot worship okay because you must have eternal life foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] it's still the same [Applause] brother every time he comes he's just the same amen [Music] yes when he changed before our brother there who's that brother and he said ah brother foreign [Applause] now that's why he asked who is this man now since the opening of the series okay amen now I'll just bring this two three things and the person is eternal foreign foreign healing power say it comes from the blood it never change saving power from the blood say it it flows eternally amen amen amen right I'm looking at the res and let's look at this person eternity he was God he's the only person that can be immoral amen you can worship Him in peace [Music] now let's be serious you must come to terms of the day you are you received the Eternal God you will never Hope from this because all right amen okay now let's look at this and he will tell you I like this in this book yeah it's saying if maybe you haven't met melchized you listen to this we've been talking about melchized fella can I ask you a question [Music] because we can't keep on talking about the person we don't know foreign [Applause] amen [Music] we are getting women hey is it not wonderful not only talking about him but getting where he is before you worship you need to find God first before you worship otherwise you'll Hope from this problem foreign [Applause] amen if you can find God in your heart because God is not a rumor Obama is something like it low well if you follow it sometimes will come and cross a big river then you stuck it right there now God is not like a that one alternative that that is this light should be in you amen amen now I reach we're Gucci we are getting where milk is the deck is when he met Abraham he was called Melchizedek foreign foreign all right is something that you you could not see it could be right here and now and you cannot see that is but when Melchizedek met him he was male kiss when when Abraham met him now that was a man in the form of a man okay now I continue for a few minutes when Abraham met him Abraham he unfolds what all the attributes will do in the Final End Amen meaning attributes will do this foreign [Applause] now now I read yeah we see you are reborn the attribute sons of his Spirit that's what we see then I continue we then he came working in and lived in the beginning lived in the in the pardon me live in that in the person of melchized later come around we never heard of more of melchized because he became Jesus I mean no reading this the sons but now it's Jesus but it's still the same man okay amen now let's turn to this before we we close I came here for one thing because we must have the revelation of these things I tend to this page and maybe I will ask that's why they were there was questions and answers foreign because he's going to ask a question here have you met melchized what if somebody said to you have you met milk foreign [Music] so you must have a true answer yes please because the prophet says he is still alive amen but it's not just milky City because like God to you he should be in your heart and of course you should know him you can't worship God you don't know that's why if you don't know him he will change from pool people from church to church you have known him you become spiritually stable wow man he said to them when they shall say here then it's not here he should be in you and as he said at that day you shall know that I am in you now the day you know he is no I want you will even know when the people talk about the they are preaching on the world and the world wait I'll tell you why people are saying that um if you can perhaps preach to the don't cut s [Music] he's not preaching Jesus he was always preaching about alcohol alcohol why because they are drinking if I want to select the people [Music] it's easy if you say um says the witches will not get into the kingdom okay repent foreign repent I'm rich why people are complaining about underwater I will tell you once they are caught in action but foreign underwear okay let's look at this I continue I I'm through right now okay Village let's look at this firstly I will read this part and that is page 23 23. and this melchized became flesh we are we are getting um [Music] even God you should worship where he is God is not a rumor God is right and if he is in you you know when he is in you you know when you are empty [Applause] because you've been struggling with your in your mind unless he is in you never do anything right one day the children of Israel Israel they were struggling to keep the law and he came and said I shall put it alone anyway but when the law was written on the stone they couldn't keep it they couldn't read about it until he came and said now I'm going to put the laws amen [Music] if the law of God is in you you cannot steal because the law is in you but if it is you will still continue amen that's why he said I shall put the Lord foreign foreign people can preach to themselves God knows and this is you know it says getting where he is he revealed himself amen I was looking at something here hey let me look at it yeah time allows me to look at this uh that's this part here when John has your hand met this Angelina and that is you know in the Book of Revelation the angel that said for I am for I am of thy fellow servants that's Revelation 20. right I mean can you read it for us I just want to say something here Revelation chapter 22 from verse 7. behold I come quickly blessed you see that keepeth the saying of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things in heaven and when I had head and sin I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant amen and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the saying of this book worship God amen amen he identified himself I am off thy fellow seven of their prophets now listen to them to my prophets it might have been Elijah it might have been it's one of the prophets now when he said it might have been Elijah I said amen amen [Music] and look at the nature of that when look at the nature of this John was a writer well Johan is but this is the spirit of a prophet now in the house of Abraham there was this prophet he was the main prophet who went to and found a wife for Isaac is because he knew the nature of Abraham and he knew how to serve Abraham the god of Abraham you know since we have the nature of God the god whom he is thank you amen amen amen Abraham choose that one okay amen now I read when he said and for I am of thy fellow servants of the prophets then I look at it here then it says here it might Incarnation for it might have been Elijah is I'll tell you that I said amen amen okay [Music] because make these things here it says and this is became flesh he revealed himself as a son of man when he come as a prophet Australia getting where he is he come in three names the Son of God the son of David who came in three names you see why you know I asked a question who came in this foreign no comment no comment right now it says getting where he is when they came to Jesus is that right okay amen and Peter said where shall we go we have arrived rapidly I mean there's no other place for us and was waiting for that way to be made now that's why the prophet says this she was part of the attack something brought her to Jesus but it's something that God has put in that woman if I don't want to come to church I can sit back home but there is something a big will even if sometimes I I'm sick Satan doesn't I mean he's so jealous he doesn't want us to worship he was kicked out of heaven is for to stop the people from worshiping God Amen because he is foreign but once he arrives here then oh he sleeps I'll tell you what will talk about it why somebody will come here only to dose of network right I haven't seen a crook like a devil now there's something you didn't hear it became flesh he received himself as a son revealed himself as a song of men son of man is that means he came as [Music] amen now let me tell you about our Supernatural s foreign [Music] that's why this part here says the angel said for I am off worry and of the prophets it might have been Elijah and I said yes amen I'm just about to read the last thing here but amen I know something I have verse 29 the unveiling of God page 29. amen I must find it it says something here um are you still here right amen look come on page 29 paragraph 184 paragraph one look don't you see now I won't this word mean Julie it's being failed we can live through these ages according to what God Said and it was to be opened in the last days [Music] foreign [Music] amen that's why I do not I did not pray for the Mysteries the Mysteries were brought to me God has revealed to you the mystery but it should be a man [Applause] he's getting to the prophet now you can worship we talk about the prophet until the people say we worship why the apostles Peter and them Jesus Jesus was a man now the first thing is yeah we know that Jesus amen amen because he's coming he's not in a letter form I said you can read which says Jesus is coming amen amen but the real coming he said which is in your heart is about to start a house amen yes who can tell me how did she know she was a woman and when he has come he will tell us who told her foreign foreign [Music] oh my God we're right now Julie if we haven't yet received and we haven't seen the Seven Seas then that means we haven't met God because the servants the seventh seeds foreign we are not surprised we'll come to the seventh series now can the church remain with six seals if you you are remaining with six seals and you are Jews oh no oh you are the Jew are you Jews will come to that seventh the six six now who preachers you can't go further foreign foreign whatever what is saying and then you hear them say it was quiet in heaven now quiet you will realize a brother said brother if you say you are preaching the seventh seal um after reading Revelation chapter eight you must do it what is the Minister of the brother immediately you must remain silently imagine a church without the seventh sea is after reading two and people believe such the seventh This Plane that's why we are coming back to this yes I still waiting for the revelation okay that's why the prophet said you should meet you must meet you but I have read that what did he say hearing getting where he is okay Amen brother let me ask a question it says where he is um right he came as old I won't read you we have read this is and he gave me communion now when he gave and his son Abraham communion you gave him of himself all right brother let me read to you this is a son of um that's right amen as I'm reading here this Angel yeah you say or bow not to me I'm also Linda one of the prophets go through this is foreign amen okay I mean they say you must after reading Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. then you should foreign foreign walking uh now listen I said I'm closing here is the thing getting women I won't read I've got the book where the prophet says we did amen all right if he says I met that melchized I met that man what does that mean I met that melchized now somebody believes that is and where is he now then he says or something in me that when Jesus [Music] all right [Music] something in me says the prophet and what do you say amen you can only meet God is being failed and evenly the hour of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God should be made known that Elijah now if I'm told the mystery should be made known in that problem I will go to serve under who that prophet um which is the word of God which is now in you you don't just follow but it's something that is in you that's why he said at that day how do you know that he is that's when the usual you are not struggling to live amen [Music] we are not struggling to be a child of God I didn't struggle to be an African I think I was born in Africa if you are a child of God you were born [Applause] received [Applause] [Music] he didn't say he that has good manners no it comes by birth not good God don't tell us he gave birth he that is born of God he that is born of God why because the nature that is in him is the nature of his father the nature of God if you don't have the nature of God you really can be a Christian a Christian means God's nature divine nature amen now now this is the things it says Elijah Elia when God sends his Prophets he sends that that's when he sends his Mysteries but in a man now usually if he comes with the word of God foreign amen all right amen that's why it is I want you to tell him when I bring that and you tell me when who has brought this message foreign and spoke about underworlds who brought that message all right now why are you
