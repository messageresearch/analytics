we have had baptism if they can stand may the Lord richly bless you amen amen amen amen it's wonderful if you also have a desire in your heart to be baptized before the Rapture the Bible says the day of salvation is now hallelujah amen while you have an opportunity come forth may the Lord richly bless you amen amen I have two announcement that I want to give to the church the first one is regarding the donations normally Believers donate the clothes for the our request is that if you have clothes to donate put a note note inside the B and hand it to the elders hallelujah hallelujah we normally advise that to give them to brother mad then he knows where to P them accordingly so that when our elders going to L then he can carry them if you don't put a note sometimes we just assume you brought them for us to B them because we also receive ER clothes and other things that are for underworld so people hand things so that they can be banned so if you don't put a note we always assume that it is not a donation for the clothes hallelujah hallelujah may the Lord richly bless you we also have a request we have the young people in the church sometimes when they use the restrooms they misuse the toilet papers sometimes they accidentally throw the toilet papers inside the water so we are appealing that the parents guide them accordingly so that when they use the restrooms they can take caution if he is too young we request the parents to accompany them to the restrooms may the Lord richly bless you as we stand on our feet we are blessed this morning and our pastor has requested our Elder to preach for us am amen amen the pastor also indicated that he will be coming the next week amen amen may the Lord richly bless you as we stand on our feet and to sing a special song uh my Elder just reminded me our Elder gabrielson traveled well to the USA us amen amen he also indicated that his heart is also in this Tabernacle may the Lord richly bless you amen amen can we just say shalom to himom amen Shalom our El Elder Elder re gabrielson Shalom our Elder Elder re gabri God bless you my brother of the voice all [Music] the be [Music] of should be finished as he has [Music] deed to [Music] hiset behold I will s you [Music] El the [Music] prophet PR [Music] and and he [Music] sh father to children [Music] heart of children to the father [Music] Holy [Music] Ghost G Holy Ghost [Music] Holy Ghost Holy [Music] Ghost hallelujah amen as I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Jesus Christ take SE for few seconds so that you may not get tired amen amen happy New Year amen I believe God will bless you this year as I normally say the New Year means approaching the Rapture because it's not like like yesterday it's a new morning it's a new day it's a new year amen amen so I want to tell you that uh our pastor was supposed to be here this morning but while he was preparing to come something just came up and then he said I must just greet the church read the scripture for a few minutes and then we go home amen amen so that's why I'm standing here this morning I'm not going to take much of your time amen amen I think last year I promised you to say something about I just want to give you just just that testimony I remember I went several times to so I said yes because he was so um I I observe something then I ask that there something something you know that I observe here amen amen that is not right it's a demon then I thought we should fight it amen is is a another country where things are done differently toward something that I observed was a first marriages marriages whereby a young man forcefully will take a girl and put it his home and then tell send somebody to tell the parents your daughter is here whether that girl you know agree or not she will just go king and the country in amen amen so once a marriage becomes a FSE marriage you will never love that woman you won't even value because you mared her forcefully that is why most of those men those men when they come to South Africa working the M they started another families here when they go back home they go Angry beat their wives beat the children because it's a false marriage amen amen so now we prayed about the thing last year December I mean I mean September we coming from and then I started that topic in the car then said oh you were not aware that the government has announced the whole country that best thing should stop [Applause] I thank God I say God you've answered us because marriage should not be Force two should agree and then even the government went further and said the the parents as well has the right to disagree in that marriage so the the marriage now between the two parents in agreement I thank God for that this word of God can change the law of the country the other thing I observed when we get there is my witness I normally when I get there I will see things and question we baptized young sisters then when they come to church they they come to church they come with bold head B head only to find that in the school and in the government they say young sisters should cut their hair because their hairs has got demons so that's what I observed when I get there thank God today that thing has came to so those things we receive and then gender based violence in a life [Music] normal pray about that because most of the time when you speak to the sisters when they consult a higher percentage pray for me my husband is beating me for no reason let's pray on that one I'll wait for the testimony amen amen so yesterday we were in we left Friday and come back yesterday just to be like Joshua and Caleb when they went to spy Jer we went to a certain place to check if when we come back for a message the seat will be planted and I I I don't know the north southeast of he went to another place and the way to that's where we want to take the message to with your prayers the country will know this message as the absolute of their so let's pray about the whole thing the pastor knows we spoke to him he said for what we call amen so we really appreciate it amen yes that's what I wanted to tell you this morning keep on playing for the suit for Su keep on praying for them things that we see there maybe you don't see them but God is doing wonders amen amen so may God richly bless you as we stand to our feet um with these songs before we read I don't know if is in the house if he's in the house I love this song way you know it amen amen hallelujah let's sing those song as we are going to read the script [Music] amen for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of the SE [Music] [Music] [Music] great [Music] [Music] our [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the SE the oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh holy [Music] [Music] the Hool [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we [Music] holy we [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen amen bless you I hope our heart desire amen we Ahad and ask our in the house for the word of let us pray Mighty God Eternal Father again Lord Almighty we are gathered here as your offsprings we are so grateful Lord Almighty to meet on the Resurrection Day amen gracious Lord here is our brother brother marar standing Lord Almighty behind your P pit which is your altar Lord Almighty father Without You beging him our presence here will be in vain without you speaking through him our presence here will be in vain just like Joshua one day who said if you don't bless me with a blessings that you bless Moses with I won't be able to take them through like Moses Lord Almighty he once stood between you and the congregation amen and said if you kill this congregation then our departure will be in vain father our pastor has appointed him has blessed him let all the anointing that is in him be upon him Lord Almighty amen we are sitting down here Lord Almighty with our prayers praying that Lord Almighty May our prayers Lord be in line with the word that is going to be delivered this morning as is he going to read the scripture Lord may your anointing your inspiration be upon him and upon the church as a whole amen father we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen amen as we open from The Book of Joshua praying and even the scripture that you're going to read is about so that's why always have Elders in the house amen amen Joshua chter 8 chapter 35 verse 35 amen amen Joshua 8:35 there was not a word of all that Moses command commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the wom and the little ones and the strangers that were conversent among them amen amen you may be seated we are going to talk about Joshua today amen amen so my message is Joshua Joshua a man with a reputation amen amen I was reading from the spoken we brother was saying only what we need only what we need is a man of reputation you can go wherever you are if you do not have reputation we don't need you we need men well for you to have reputation you must have passed certain stages two stages the third one is the reputation now listen to what the scripture says here there was not a word of H that Moses commanded which Joshua not all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversent among amen amen Joshua Joshua was a good follower what I want to tell you this for you to be a reputable man you must have had courage before you have courage you must have had an inspiration you get inspired after the inspiration you have courage after courage become a reputable amen amen is God only who gives you courage but inspiration you get it from a man not God a man must inspire you for you to have courage then you become a man of that's what I'm going to talk about because joshuaa the Bible says all the Commandment that Moses gave to him he read to the congregation he got inspired by the life of Moses how Moses did things and Moses was an ordinary person like you and me but God visited him amen amen and Moses had a challenge with his wife but he never divorced her he was never angry he contined with the word of God that kind of a woman when mes says one she's already at 10 because he can call him new bloody husband today you can't call your husband they are there may God bless that because Moses has to pass through that as well challing woman even circumcise her own son you understand we have those in life don't life and God does everything he knew why so he started to read what Moses taught him and he continue with it for the rest of his life until one of the days God visited Joshua before he visited Joshua he got inspired from Moses he was a good follower no matter what Moses say he will do it because he realized God whom he worshiped was Ines he was not following Moses as a person he was following what was in that's why he became a man of rep you know they are men but you should be a man amongst me a man whom other will look up we need such and compromised me let's read Joshua chapter one my my scriptures today is three of them the one for inspiration from Joshua the one from for courage from Joshua the one from reputation from Joshua let's go to the second one of courage and when I talk about Joshua I speak about you you must be like him verse 5 to 7 1 ver 5 to 7 CH 5 1 ver 5-7 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto these people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i s unto their father to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou might observe to do according to all that law all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left left that thou might Prosper with with soever thou goest amen amen this is a message of encouragement be strong and of a good courage I will never fail thee nor forsake thee this was God talking to Joshua you need courage from God but you need inspiration from a man he had inspiration from A Man Called Moses now he need courage from God himself after God gave him courage he became a reputable man you need to know where you need a man where you need God where you need to stand alone don't just leave H you must live with a purpose you must know your standpoint you must know your position in God until no one can shake you if someone can shake you you were standing on a shake you must come to a point whereby even if other people can talk bad about your pastor but you will say I'll still stick to him because God whom I worship I see in him many people came to Joshua discouraging him but God gave him courage until he stick to Moses after sticking to Moses what was in Moses is now in him and when he's in him they were looking at him when he was flying up there be that kind of a man the people will come and go will come and discourage you and so forth and so forth sck what you believe in then Joshua absorbed from God then he leave knowing that I got encouragement from God you see God said to him I will not forsake thee that was God it was not Moses that was God and then Joshua lived a good life before God before Israel and then they started to test him they started to test him these people when they test Joshua he stood for his cause I'm going to read you a code here brother Bram says if you are a child of God you are not getting tested you are not getting tempted you did not yet come to a place where God can trust you you need to be tested Temptation need to come your way and you must be happy for the Temptation for they make you stronger they make you stronger amen amen you no longer cry you no longer complain about the wishes you just smile because you know I have courage I am strong because he confirm it to me now I be a man of reputation when they test Joshua he didn't run away he didn't pray he didn't complain but he said something you better say that as well let's read it in the Book of Joshua chapter 24 he was inspired he got courage then he become a man of reputation verse 14 to 17s 24 vers 14 that's my last scripture to 22 Joshua 24 ver14 to 17 yes amen now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father SED on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flat or the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord let's just stop there you know a man of reputation he come to a place whereby he said to the people me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord you are not going to tell me what I need to do but I will serve the Lord IR respective of the condition that a man of reputation he knows his stand the people cannot shake you continue 16 and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed amen amen you know Joshua Joshua after getting inspired and encouraged by God he have to stand for this because inspiration and encouragement produce reputation when they brought reputation to him now he stand and he started to talk when you started to talk many will hate you but later they realized that you are the man of reputation you stand for what you believe in you are not compromised by the circumstances amen amen so Joshua said to them your forefathers came out of Egypt God protected them along the way you must not follow de but if today you follow their deeds not with me I'm not going to settle for death I'm going to be out of Israel stand there on top of the mountain me and my family We Shall Serve the Lord those that want to serve the Lord they will come where I am that was a different Joshua was a different somebody was an uncompromised man and he stood for that today you don't want to fall what Moses taught me the courage I receive from God up to you none of my business I stand there you shall follow me if you do not want to follow me you shall die in your SE we need young men that will stand for this messages when they get to the university they stand for what they believe in from behind this pull pit not being compromised by the circumstances of the University until the people in the University said we have seen people but not this one that's a young man and a young women of reputation you are not like unto them we know our daughters when they get to the university they took off the long dresses and put on the trousers there's no reputation in you yes I was not expecting amen because the truth will remain the truth and the people shall remain quiet because I know I'm telling the truth you drink you go out with boys and girls at the universities you are like unto them be a young man and a young sister of reput amen amen we need brothers and sisters who as a family will say people will have problems in their families but I will stand for this message and do the right thing for my family not expecting amen as well on that because there's chaos in the fames but brother be a man of reputation be like Joshua stand in the mountain and said to the people me and my family Shall Serve the Lord the others can go wherever they want but I will stick to this be like Joshua a man of reputation a man who looked at the Unseen from the Masterpiece the pastor quote last week I I got it here as well because it speaks about Michel Angelo said Michel Angelo when he do the Masterpiece of Moses he was seeing something that other people couldn't see amen amen he was tasked to make the stat of Moses amen am Michel Angelo Mich Angel a sculptor from Italy amen I read but this and the Master's piece that Michael Angelo had made it cost him something to do that he was a great man it costed a big part of his life because he was many many years in caving out just take a rock of marble and keep it caving it the people were laughing at him he was doing it in his heart in his vision he saw Moses so he tried to bring him on this rock then he continued doing it and do it the people were looking at him passing you know he was continuing every day when he he wake UPS he continue with that work because he saw Moses now a geni sculptor is inspired you see you need to start with inspiration like a genuine poet or any other genuine singer or a musician whatever it might be all realiz to come by inspiration Michel Angelo must have had an inspiration of whates really like amen and he CAU it in his mind what Moses must have been so he he set forth on his great piece of mind [Music] they cut into the patter bring it down Hing down until he got the real picture of what must have amen amen a sculptor would make a great Masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind the building as as our lord Jesus told us a man doesn't light a hand a candle and put it under a bution when he becomes God Masterpiece will not it in an early somewhere we must give it light let the people know who you are at your University at your workplace at your home at your neighbors in your relative light up that candle other people they don't know whether they are Christian or at their work places if they don't know who you are at your work you have a problem I'm telling you the truth why the colleag don't know that you are a Christian what are you hiding so we see it after he had made his master piece he he placs it up here on Earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was is God now in the Garden of Eden how he has must have pleased him that he saw his Master this masterpiece was well after that we found out that he rested he was so pleased with his work when God condescend he condescended as God and incarnate himself in his Masterpiece when that Masterpiece stand up it was God that masterpiece was a man and a man becomes God the Masterpiece came to to me and to you is because God smoked it at Calvary no matter how many dead he had raised how great he had preached what his great life was what his claim was he was proven there he was so pleased God was till he was the only man that ever stood on the face of the Earth that God could Smite for the rest of them that perfect one was meeting for the imperfect the whole creation that had fell through Adam it was redeemed through Jesus Christ God Master peace stood the test the test come because of Temptation you need to be tempted tested and become a man of reputation Jesus becames a man of reputation for the entire world even the Sinners speak about him because there's no other way you can have your entire life without talking about Jesus because he was a man of reputation he stood the test of time he became more than a conqueror until today when we are called Christian we must have been in his footsteps we must be more than conquer we must have been tested so we were in the footstep of our Lord Jesus Christ when we were in the footstep of the of Christ Jesus at the end we became him until the people say you are making yourself God you are making yourself better you think you know better than till the people say seven SE or no seven SE we are going to heaven you must have known the seventh seal other people whether seals are preach or not you need to know them while you are still here it should be our way of life it should be our culture it should be who we are bet there are people that are in the message talking like Sinners you are confusing things you are not confus we are not confusing things God gave us when we give unto you either you accept or you reject when you reject the seven se you speak like them the people that are in the Rapture is the seventh seal is the message itself when Jesus reveals secret to the others those one describe the the Prest they were there complaining Isaiah the letter kth you must know the mystery of God not Isaiah as you read you must be that reading only to find that when they read they read about Jesus but they don't know because God has in the in in the disciple a man of reputation brother Bram brother here he speaks about a man by the name of John Bradford that's why I will keep on saying need men and women that will stood for what they believe in when brother is talking about this man he said there was a tender in Australia AAL to build a bridge between north and you know South syney that bridge was given to the tender you know nationally amen amen and then people put their attend and the job description was you build a bridge from South Sydney to and then the tender was I mean the tenderers asked how much is the you know money for the project then the country in Australia says you can charge us whatever we will pay we are not into money people first we need to build a bridge for the people to pass Australia South Australia North that's what you want money power they went there expecting billions they check they dig and they dig after some time they came back but I can't why no it's water it's water after water is sent after sent is Clay after some Shak there will never be a brid here then they were disqualified then the tender went internationally Russia Russia America America England England Africa Africa Europe Europe Canada come and build a priest whatever money you need you will give it to you we don't care about money we care about our people then the engineers The Architects came from all over the place and view the place when there you know when there's a tender you know tender coming you attend a meeting you will go for a side visit then they did they check as well after checking Israel they said no there's no breach here then nationally they failed internationally they failed continue here a young man from England a young architect from up in England came down a famous man a reputable man had a good reputation or I I like that and I like a man with reputation or you don't have to be a big man you can be a PO that lives in an attic and and have a reputation far better the last poor person but you can be a man of reputation you don't have to be rich you can just have a reputation it declare your reputation what you are makes you what you are it gives you your reputation and you are known by your reputation this man went down there with a wonderful reputation he looked the situation over he walked the banks of the few days he he studed it he tested it he sounded he looked around after a while he went to the mayor and said to him I'll take the job he must have seen the Unseen must a vision he must have seen something couldn't see because he went to the mayor and said to him I take the job and the mayor said to him what you know what you're taking he said to him thoroughly understand but remember a young man a young man not an old man not a middleaged man a young man a young man is someone between the age of 18 and 35 that is why a young man Lord Jesus Christ died for us at the cross he had reputation he stood the test of time a young man and he say Lord I will hang on the cross the entire world can look at me because I'm saving you church here a young man took that do we still have those young men he said well this great architect this great architect yes as Americans and architect from all over the world Bridge builds has come here and they afraid to take the but he said but say I'm Not Afraid not afraid for the job I'll take it he said I realize that I have a reput a worldwide reputation as a bridge builder but take my reputation for I can build it oh he had a vision before a man can make a reputation he has to have a vision of what he's doing if a man want to go to heaven he must have a vision heav looks we are not just those who say you having cour days you will stand on your own I want people this morning I want these people this morning that you must come to a point whereby you stand for yourself then you are a person of reputation you know what you stand for that's the reason to go that's a reason there's a heaven to go because we have vision for heaven amen amen that's the reason we can have a reputation as Christian we know what material is in this building that's right the blood of Jesus Christ is in this building that's right his stained blood has washed away all our sins he must believe DEH completely that's why brother when he look at us at the vision he say you are sinless you are without wrinkles when he looks at you on the other side for you to be on the other side you must have had that Vision amen amen he took me from the Elis of hell and made me his servant then I believe in him so I passed from Death to life and every believer every has did that because that they got confidence and they believe in this great Builder great AR Lord Jesus Christ the mayor of austral austral he said the one who's asking just give amen amen those people just we'll see and he also just we just see the where we going and this young man he said okay I was brother Bram says he was W every morning he was working on the banks and come back and again go and come back alone then he said to the mayor I'll take the job they discouraged him keep on saying I will take the job and then they say go on this person something that made him to to accept the job says when he go there he asked for the machine to dig from the water to the scent from the scent the the the Shak St where other sto he continue going deeper when he go deeper he found a Rock when he found a rock he said in Christ the solid Ro amen amen when he found the rock it was a smile in him say guys stop let's go put machine just your Mach I've seen something that others could not see I had a vision of this now here we are when he get back to the mayor he said I have made something other architect meet then he said what he so when I go down when I go deeper and deeper I found the rock when I found the rock I stop there that's where will be the base of our PR can I say this to the church if you go and go and never make a rock you are not a worshiper a worshiper must have met the rockus is the Jesus stop amen amen then the mayor said so from here going forward what doing he said just put your money aside let me do this and it's not about money it's about what you requested from me for your people to cross North andth amen amen there's this uh brother who love to do this kind of a job then I ask him are you sure in my career when I check this job you want to do you must make sure it's about passion because it's not about money but if you want money this job is not going to support your family I said it to the brother you know wanting advice you will work and work for 15 years and when you check you have nothing in the bank and you won't marry you won't buy a house you buy a car you'll just be a brother I was telling the brother there but if you want to get married and have a car and have a I mean a house and support your family maybe as an elder brother take this way he took the way he bought a car he bought a house he has a wife kids now this man he said out of laugh I will do this money later amen amen then brother said here and then he went over go around him the very best architect that he could find the best scientist the best equipment he sent away and got still for this bridge when he did it he will not put one steel one piece of Steel not even one B until it was scientifically tested to see if there was any blows in it to see if there's any little a where in The Foundry where theyve made it and molded it and to see if it was tested right what a memorial word will be to his reputation as a bridge builder now here brother Brom say a lot of times people say oh I'm so tempted blessed be the name of the Lord for The Temptations when I'm weak then I'm said Paul every son that come to God must first be tried and tested and these testing are more sweeter to you and dearer to you precious gold is a testing time hopefully from here going home you are not going to complain about Temptation every time a wind HS a tree show it back and forth back and forth loen The Roots so it can go deeper and get better hold every time sickness St in your home every time try strike your home every time the neighbor says something bad about you it's your only shaking you it's only shaking you losing you up so you can get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable that's how God does he send those trials to test you to prove you to shake you and give you a hold amen amen as time goes by when they test those Steels and they find hes in they find some substant things in without asking they don't modify it where I'm working we don't need notification if you not SP for a certain task you wait until the right one you don't Weld and try to feed kind of a thing no if something is not working brother is not working is not fitting take it out B it don't even send it to another project B it and brother Bram said that is who we are this morning if the brothers or the sisters are not feed in this building of the Bride of Jesus Christ God himself remove them and throw them away you will be wondering why the people are living here they don't fit [Applause] if they fit they will be here this morning if they are not this morning they are not in this ministry feed building here they need to be out be a good brother good sister a if you don't fit we are not going to modify you you that makes you we are very much sorry but that's how things are and our game is God doing it and then this man is looking at the bridge is complete now he do some test when he was doing some test something in his heart said to him you made it you made it other Architects other Bridge Builders they went down and they stop here and you go deeper that's what has given you the confidence confidence that's why they given you the courage and at this moment you will reap what you saw and this man they brother is explaining here he said the architect all stand around and say as soon as any vibration breach she'll go right straight down it will be dangerous you understand amen no insurance company give insurance on it he didn't need any insurance he said my bridge will hold he had confidence remember he just have confidence because he met something that others could not mean now he must test it because it's his his reputation at state certainly it is and if it did hold it will be Memorial amen amen the reputation of Christ is at he will not give us just something to build a church not a manmade theology not upon some school experience or build some Seminary as they wanted to this morning to educate preachers the real preacher come from the Seminary of God's grace God's calling and it's time tested that's right it holds God got confidence in you we got confidence in him amen amen now the man reputation was at stake then the breach was completed at the required time that bre did not even have a duration you know in the project when they give you a project of three years finish it on the fourth of the fifth year you not going to get a profit youve done it at loss we we we agreed on that but this one was so special until they even say take your time but at the end you want the good products then he said guys we are done and then he said I will walk on this pre hey this man had confidence if you don't want to I'll go alone I will go alone on this bridge of South and North C come back and I will go alone and come back this was the the idea that Joshua had if you don't want to worship I will go alone with my family I will go alone and stand there if you don't come none of my business this man said to them I will walk alone if you don't come it's none of your business and then something came into the mayor and the mayor said to him no I'll go with you I'll follow you with my mayor's car then this man said because I have confidence you can even bring four locomotives the tracks everything they can walk in the bridge I like it when Jesus was going to Jerusalem with an S when he get somewhere he stopped and look at Jerusalem and started to prophesy he was alone when he started to prophesy and Tred to take one step the young people just brought leaves and put it before you so that the lot of hosts can walk you know you know it was an automatic thing things of God happen automatically you don't need to plan them doing them I see this man as well John brefeld when he say I will walk the mayor said I will follow with some tracks with some locomotive the people with the Camas were looking waiting for the briest to fall other people that were never invited automatically heart something just say man and they followed him they just walk on the bridge maybe let me read it because he's here on the spoken way that young fellow walked out there on that bridge set his car down back down and see them locomotive all L up and see the mayor there waving at him looked and seen tens of thousand of foot men he never asked them he just look and see them standing back there ready to match with him a man of reputation who put his life at St and Strike Up the Band B brother when the B playing the whistle went blowing the horns went going I mean there was an awful vibration taking place but he walk right across that bridge and she never moved the bridge never moved he took the for front that's very much important he took the for front he W brothers and sisters that will take the four that's where you gain a reputation even when you are dead you are name forever stay there was a man there was a sister that name never be removed from people's mind I'm reading here telling you about Joshua how many of you has ever met him but as his reputation us to know about him amen amen amen then he went the people just say I want to be part of History we die or we don't die we no longer care we follow this man they followed oh they passed they come back they go they come back even today 2025 the priest still stand that was built in 1955 1955 it's still stand today men that has reputation you cannot challenge them when you talk Their Eyes Are CL their ears are closed amen amen there are certain people here this morning if you can say I start a new church here leave this pastor they just look at you mhm then they follow their Pastor because they seen something that you cannot see that is why you took a decision of living here farewell you don't suit here when you suit here you be here this morning be a man of reputation because the time will come for testing you shall be tested when you get tested you must show your color put someone in a someone put someone in a squeeze you know their colors many of you good people but let me put you in theque will realize that [Applause] brother I didn't know you can swear like that next time time when I meet you after greeting you I becomes more conscious those I don't want to hear them again because when someone is at squee show his colors when Jesus was at squeeze Calvary he shows his color and say Lord God forgive them his car they don't know what they are doing he never said one of the days at the of judgment I will punish you I will BR you to he said Lord forgive them he was the Masterpiece he was the man whom we must follow when we are in trouble when they are testing us we must look at them for them and said Lord God open their eyes they don't see what I see they don't know what I know for We are following Jesus as the Christian of the old in anti you know initially they were no Christian but in anti when they started to see the people following Jesus they look at them you know they observe them they study them they do research about them and they made a conclusion these people are Christians hallelujah amen why they are Christian when they look at their lives they look like Christ they speak like him they like him they preach like him they are him these people are chrisan you know the people will make you honest you can lie to yourself but the people will make and tell you who you are people out there they will tell you that one is so mean you know what they've seen the way you do things the way you approach Med and they realiz that is true about life and you can't deny that what you are doing the people will not tell you but they looking at you even if you are doing things looking at way they know what is happening and they will tell you honest things and they will come and tell you you know the way you live with your family it shows if there is because they've seen heaven in you now when the cameramen were looking at the activity they waiting for the down brother your life your Christ life in you people are looking at the downfall but you are just cruising to the highest level where do you know I like it when Joshua amen amen said me and my house you never said the people I'm fellowshiping with he never said my neighbors he never said my elders he never said my brothers he said me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord we need men and women that can the same and myve the Lord the church and and my Shall Serve the Lord we need those kind of people because we are living here in a real world and we live reality that a history repeat itself there will be that will be standing and looking at you there will be men that will disagree with you but you must just go higher and higher with a smile because the batt you are facing is fighting it let me tell you one thing I've told the people and I've made a conclusion and I said to them you see my pastor is a man of reputation others do not like it who cares I don't care because I've seen what they do not see you want to tell me you were on those days you were listen to K and to hate Moses jhua said to them I don't care I follow Moses up the mountain amen amen you see you can talk about brother BR you can talk about Jesus you can talk about Michel Angel you can talk about John bre but once you talk about there no [Music] amen but tell me who cares I don't care amen you need to come to a level or a position where your reputation will tell the people who you are amen just just stick to him just stick to the pastor brother you see this Bible that you have that you read is history the people inside here you never met them you just hear about them but those that you meet seen the power of God in them you see like they're not just nothing you cannot even talk about them now I want to tell you wherever I am I talk about this church I talk about the singing I talk about our life I listen to the music we have in church until they made a conclusion about me I said yes I stand for my cause I will die for my cause no one can shake me because I know of a brother who wanted to be the pastor and live here and say hate the pastor today is preaching death you must love your pastor because he a pastor but the pastor he used to have he hated the most brothers and sisters listen to No Man listen to God stick to what you believe in if they want you to hate your past tell them to
