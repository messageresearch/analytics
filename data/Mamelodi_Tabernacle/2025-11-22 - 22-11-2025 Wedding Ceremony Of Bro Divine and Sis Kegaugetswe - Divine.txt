This is God's work. It is not a man's creation. It's not a man's work. It's God's work. The world may try to imitate God claiming that marriage belongs to the world. I will say no, it doesn't belong to this world. It is God's creation. That will remain a fallacy. Hence, there is no truth in that and it is misleading. Amen.

I greet you all in this hall in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. As I was mandated by pastor that I must help in this type of situation. But after his passing away, &gt;&gt; the board of mood renewed that Monday they said, "Pastor Makua, You must go on helping us. I'm standing here today in a new mandate mandated by the board &gt;&gt; of Modi &gt;&gt; Assembly. um I wouldn't have just come saying that the pastor said but I had to listen to the board and when the board said now we still mandate then I'm standing here with a mandate I'm not get crashing. &gt;&gt; I was mandated. God bless this mandate. They said until they have a new pastor. In other words, you will see me here. That is a mandate. Whilst standing on our feet, let's open the book of Joshua. We see brother Brenam in cases like this one. He didn't used to preach. He was just officiating. But I don't know where did we get this preaching. But let me just do something also as we read the book of Joshua chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Can you read it from verse 1 to 4? &gt;&gt; Verse one. &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 3 from verse 1 to 4. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and they removed from Shetim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. And it came to pass after 3 days that the officers went through the host. And they commanded the people, saying, "When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about 2,000 cubits by measure. Come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which he must go for ye have not passed this way before. &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes. &gt;&gt; Father, here I am. Here is the church. Here are the two people who are to be joined together. Here is the scripture. Fred, I am asking that you take these words here, place them in each and everyone's hearts here so that when they get out of this hall, they might have something to meditate on. I pray heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; As you know, &gt;&gt; today is the day of dive and they must enjoy this day. I mustn't take their time. I must just join them. Because marriage comes from God and it must be God to sanction it. And where is God? God said as my father has sent me so I send you as I'm standing here. I'm sent by him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; if I'm sent by him, it means he has seen me and if you stand in front of me, you are standing in front of him. And now here, I've got just a little topic. That topic is &gt;&gt; is the new road. The road I'm going to usher the two in, it will be the new road to them. They have never went through this road before. They're going to start to walk in this road. &gt;&gt; They don't know it. That's why Joshua here said, &gt;&gt; he said, "Come and follow the ark because we are we are to enter the new land." But you must follow the ark because you have not went through this before. And I think these two they have not went this before. It's the road of marriage. They have not went through. When God was creating the earth, he made mountains, &gt;&gt; hills and rivers and the valleys &gt;&gt; and the plains. He was showing that in the life we're going to walk through because life is a journey he was showing us. But in this journey of life it we will have mountains to climb. They will have valleys to go through. There will be plains to go through even in the in this route of marriage. There will be mountains to go through. There will be valleys to go through. There will be plain to go through. Don't don't expect that you'll go only through the plane. You will have to climb the mountain. You will have to go deep to the valley. When Israel was fighting with the the Assyrians, &gt;&gt; the Assyrians for Israel on the mountains. Israel defeated them and they thought, "The God of Israel &gt;&gt; is the God of the mountain. They said let's meet them on the valley so that we can defeat them because their god is the god of the mountain and they were defeated also in the valley. Well, I want to tell the two when they go through the mountain, when they go through the valley, they must know the word of the mountain. &gt;&gt; The word of the is still the word of the valley. The word of the plain is still the word of the mountain is the word of the valley. He is always there. But what they must do, they must not forget to follow the ark in marriage. Some will try. You must be careful who you allow to walk with you in this road to walk with you. with you both. You must be careful because some will help you to end soon. They will lead you to the to chaos. You must trust everybody. In this road of death, what you must do? Follow the ark. When there is problems, follow the ark. When there is happiness, follow the ark. There will be trials. There will be tribulations in this road. But you must know what you must know that God's hand is always leading you because you are following the ark. When you follow the ark, you must know the order of the ark because the ark has got its own order. That's why Joshua said, "You must not interfere with the order of the earth." Follow the order &gt;&gt; of the earth. There was a man who failed to follow the order of the earth. And he caused the death of two innoc of a one innocent person. because he didn't follow the order of the ark. He wanted to bring the ark that which is a good thing but he had to follow the order of the ark. This act Paul said follow me as I follow Christ. It means Paul was the ark of his time. If you are following Paul, you were following the ark because in the ark there there was God there. He said follow me because I am following Christ. What does he mean? He means when you follow him, you are following Christ. In other words, you cannot follow Christ following Paul. It was the order of the ar you couldn't stand and say I'm following God. I'm following Christ but not following Paul. You will be out out of the order of the ark. We are still having the ark. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that act has got its order. You must follow the order. If you follow the order of the ark, I promise you your journey in the marriage, it will be a successful journey. But if you don't follow the order, you want to interfere with the ark. You want to help from the ark. You want to help from the ark, but you interfere with the ark. Follow the order. And when you follow the order of the ark, Then we get the good results. Not like David. David find bad results because he failed to to to follow the order of the earth in this book tell my disciple. He said people will say how am I going to do this? or do that. Go out will take care of the rest of it. Don't ponder what I'm going to do in this vein of marriage. God will take care of the rest if you follow the act. Don't lose focus of the ark. &gt;&gt; Follow it in this journey. &gt;&gt; The in this road of marriage is not about perfection. Everything that is started by God Satan will fight it with with whatever he has because marriage is started by God. Satan will try to fight it and he is fighting it even now. You are witnesses here. Satan is fighting is fighting in the marriage because it is started by God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mistakes will happen. Sometimes ways will hurt and it is part of being a human being. Real couples couples. Couples, we learn to apologize to one another because that heals faster. It heals. It heals faster than silence. Amen. If there is mistakes, it helps &gt;&gt; to forgive one another to ask to ask for forgiveness to to apologize to one another because that heals faster than silence. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real couples, &gt;&gt; the couples in this route of marriage, &gt;&gt; they will stay, talking together, forgiving one another, &gt;&gt; learning about one another, learning about one another, You must learn about your wife and your wife must learn about you. He must know what he must know. The the wife, she must know what you want. What you don't want. You must also know what she wants. What she don't want. Amen. That is the way life goes on in this room. You must you must learn forgiving one another. You must learn. When you you you forgive one another, you will you will grow together. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if if you you hold some grudges &gt;&gt; or files, &gt;&gt; you will never grow in this journey of marriage. We don't hold files. We talk together. &gt;&gt; We bring the files. We open them. See what is in the file and throw them in the dust pin. Real couples in this route of marriage. They must know that this road has ups and downs. Staying together. It will make them stronger. You must not shun from one another. If you shan from one another in the bedroom, you are causing a problem because God said you must not shine from one another in the bedroom and that will cause someone to get in Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm I'm talking to you. &gt;&gt; Some are just trying to &gt;&gt; Some are trying to to to take what is not theirs. It is yours because the road you have not walked in before. I have walked through this room. I'm telling you. I'm telling you what is happening in this room. I am not telling you a fiction. I'm telling you what is happening. in this room. &gt;&gt; The young man with an uncircumcised heart &gt;&gt; must not marry. &gt;&gt; Let me repeat. A young man with an uncircumcised heart, &gt;&gt; he must not marry. &gt;&gt; You see in my tradition. &gt;&gt; If you are an ancircumcised person, you are not allowed to marry. than a person with his with an uncircumcised heart. That's why Jesus said when they were telling him about divorces, he said is because of your uncircumcised heart which causes because He he will never he he should be the head of the family. He should be the leader of the family. How can he be the head of the family &gt;&gt; if he is headless? Because his head must be crushed. &gt;&gt; If then he if he is uncircumcised because Christ dwells in a circumcised heart. If the heart is not circumcised, it means Christ is not there. If Christ is not there, then you are hateless. How can you be the head when you are hateless? Amen. The proverb says, &gt;&gt; who can find a virtuous woman for her price? &gt;&gt; For her price is more is above rubies. Who can find such people? It means it is scarce woman. You cannot find &gt;&gt; I believe my brother you have found a visual I it's my belief because he scares to be found. He says but prophet says Solomon says riches belongs to the father &gt;&gt; but the prudent woman &gt;&gt; is a gift from God. If you find a prudent woman, yeah, that is a wise woman. Prudent woman is a wise woman who can differentiate. He can see this is not good. It's not good for my husband. This is good for my husband. Is a prudent woman. The Bible says is a gift from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said if you find a woman, &gt;&gt; you must know &gt;&gt; that you are given by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the most important thing besides salvation is a good woman. &gt;&gt; If God can give you something better above besides salvation is a good in other words you can't just find a woman you can't just find a wife beside God giving you amen &gt;&gt; you too You too, &gt;&gt; you too stand out. &gt;&gt; But you must know, you must follow the art &gt;&gt; in this journey. You must not lose focus. I said you must know who you allow. You must know. You must know who you allow to get with to walk with you in this chain because he may misdirect you. Leave this ark. Don't follow the order of the ark. Just go this way. Don't lose focus. If you don't lose focus, your journey will end smoothly. God &gt;&gt; is taking control. We know our God is the one who initiated these things. He has taken a woman out of a man. He didn't took another dust, &gt;&gt; but out of the man, &gt;&gt; he took a woman. When marriage is a restoration, in other words, you go back to where you belong. Amen. is she is going back where she belonged &gt;&gt; because in the beginning when God created man he created male and female that's why when Adam was a man there God said it was not Good. They must be two male and female. If a man is not married is not complete, &gt;&gt; is incomplete. Those who have come with you, they must stand together with you. Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; I studied this way. &gt;&gt; You You come together. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You can just you together come that way. I will start with you. Let me study that side. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I ask you tell me your name and then the the relationship with the brother. Who will I ask to give this man to this woman? My name is Dim Sakala. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I am the father of Zal Sakala. He is my first born and I'm very happy that today finally he's got what he has always wanted. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; And this is my one. this one. &gt;&gt; Uh my name is Senzeni Sakala. I'm the mother to divine Sakala. &gt;&gt; Okay. Divine Saga. &gt;&gt; Divine Sakala. &gt;&gt; They say you are allowed. &gt;&gt; You are true parents. &gt;&gt; Can I ask Give this woman to be wife of this man. What relationship? &gt;&gt; I am the father of mo is my secondborn child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My daughter, this is the work of God. &gt;&gt; God bless. I'm the mother to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's my second born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; The Lord God protect her through her journey of her marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless. you allow her to be the wife of &gt;&gt; I do. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Then you four can take your seats. &gt;&gt; I want to remain with only the two. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God, the face of this company to join the two together. This man and this woman in a holy matrimony which is commanded by St. power to be honorable among all men. It is therefore not by any means to be entered into unadvisably rightly. But it must be entered advisory. in the fear of God in this holy state. These two persons present come to be joy. If there is any reason, if there is any person that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony, do you now speak or from hereafter forever hold your peace. There is none. &gt;&gt; I will require and I will charge you both as you will surely answer at the day of judgment. When the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that that either of you No any impediment. Why you should not be lawfully joined together in this matrimony? Do you now confess it? will be it assured unto you that any couple that are joined otherwise than go their marriage is not lawful but surely believing that you have considered this solemn obligation that you are about to assume and that you have prepared to enter upon reverently gratefully in the fear of God. I shall propose to you the marriage covenant. You will declare the same when you join your right hands together. &gt;&gt; I'm studying with you divine. &gt;&gt; I I was talking to a young man. I was talking another man. I said to him, you have you have you have broken your marriage vow because you said you will take this woman as your only woman, not with another woman. But now you have taken another. &gt;&gt; Now you have taken another one. You have broken that part. I said it will be up to you and your husband. It will be up to you and your wife. If your wife forgives you, it will up it will be up to you. You must come to me together. You are taking a vow divine. God doesn't allow us to make vows. He said our yes must be yes. But when it comes to marriage, God allows us to take a vow and to break a vow is a serious thing. There is a man called &gt;&gt; There was a man called He she he broke the covenant. They said he mustn't get out of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; One day he said, "I will just go and come back." Someone saw him and he he was killed for that. The vow should not be broken. You must you must know what you are doing because uh this these days they say when people divorce they will call the pastor who married them then I will tell them I told you that you must not break the bar. Would you take this woman &gt;&gt; to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of maturity? Do you promise to honor, &gt;&gt; love, cherish in sickness, in health, riches or poverty? And will you forsake all others, and leave thee only unto her as long as you both live? If it is so, you might say, "Yes, I will." &gt;&gt; Yes, I will. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Divine. &gt;&gt; I trust. Would you have this man to be I'm asking you would you have this man to be your lawful wed husband to live together in this holy spirit? Do you promise &gt;&gt; to love, honor, perish in sickness, healthy, and forsake all others, and leave thee only unto him. As long as you so, say, I will. Yes, I will. I will. Amen.
