[14:21] [applause]
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Shallow
[14:27] our gracious heavenly father. Again this
[14:29] morning we like to thank you Lord.
[14:33] We like to thank you father that you
[14:35] always
[14:36] kept on amazing us
[14:40] [music]
[14:40] &gt;&gt; because that seven sea lord that has
[14:43] been revealed to us
[14:45] it keep on shooting every time.
[14:49] Whenever as we are looking Lord it
[14:52] shoots again. [music]
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Whenever we are looking Lord it shoots
[14:56] again and reveals
[14:59] &gt;&gt; and as it reveals oh Lord it becomes a
[15:01] mystery.
[15:03] to the kingdom of the darkness.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; It becomes my father a mystery which
[15:09] cannot be interpreted
[15:12] &gt;&gt; to those who are not even predestinated
[15:14] Lord. Father, this morning we like to
[15:18] thank you as we come as we came from
[15:21] different places, oh Lord, coming to
[15:24] thee. And some of us, oh Lord, they came
[15:28] because Lord, they've got uh their
[15:31] situations where they need [music]
[15:33] the addressing Lord this morning so that
[15:37] they can have the solution.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; And Father, we thank you that this is
[15:41] the house of Abraham. It is the house of
[15:44] solutions, Lord. And father, we thank
[15:47] you, Father, that as we are gathered
[15:49] here, Lord, I know that even the enemy
[15:51] is not happy. As long as the sons of God
[15:55] are gathering, oh Lord,
[15:57] &gt;&gt; the enemy is not happy. But Father, we
[16:00] like to stand against the sons of the
[16:02] devil this morning again, Lord.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Because Father, we thank you that the
[16:07] word, your word is so powerful. And
[16:10] father we thank you that even our pastor
[16:13] who's going to be with us this morning
[16:15] oh Lord that salt that word which was
[16:17] [music] with brother Brennham our
[16:19] prophet is with him also father and we
[16:23] thank you that Lord even yesterday
[16:26] when he was preaching Lord in Albaton he
[16:29] mentioned something father profound when
[16:32] he said Lord even that thief Lord who
[16:35] was with Christ on the cross father He
[16:39] said, "Oh God, have mercy on me and
[16:43] remember me in your kingdom." Now the
[16:46] pastor says that how did the thief know
[16:49] that Jesus is a kingdom?
[16:52] Because he was a thief. But father we
[16:55] thank you that it was because the thief
[16:57] was predestinated.
[16:59] And father we thank you also the woman
[17:01] of Samaria. Father, she was also
[17:04] predestinated. [music]
[17:06] She said, "I know that the Messiah is
[17:08] coming." Father, we thank you this
[17:10] morning, oh Lord, that you never leave
[17:13] us. You'll never forsake us. Oh Lord,
[17:15] you are always with us. Father, you hold
[17:18] us by your hand. And we thank you this
[17:21] morning. Oh Lord, as we are gathered
[17:23] into this place, Father, we've got our
[17:25] brothers leading us with songs. Oh Lord,
[17:28] we we pray that you Lord, you you you
[17:30] hide him, Father, under your wings, as
[17:33] we continue, Father, praising you this
[17:36] morning, oh Lord, we pray, Father, for
[17:38] all the tithing. We pray all the
[17:40] offerings that are still coming, oh
[17:42] Lord. And also, Father, we pray for
[17:44] those who are sick this morning. In the
[17:47] mighty name of the Lord Jesus, we know
[17:49] that father through your word father
[17:52] they are going to be healed because your
[17:55] word it is you yourself it is the your
[17:58] word is Christ himself. Your word is
[18:01] that logos oh lord and when it is
[18:03] revealed to us father every knee shall
[18:06] bow and every tongue shall confess that
[18:09] you are the only god and there's no
[18:11] other in the mighty name of Jesus.
[18:14] Father when the higher power comes in,
[18:16] when the higher kingdom comes in, the
[18:19] lesser kingdom has to vacate the place.
[18:21] And that is why we are praying this
[18:23] morning that the lesser kingdom must
[18:26] vacate the place right now in the mighty
[18:28] name of the Lord [music] Jesus. You
[18:31] devil, you are not invited into this
[18:34] place. You are not needed into this
[18:36] place. But we pray that in the name of
[18:39] Jesus, Lord is going to reveal himself
[18:42] this morning. And when he reveal himself
[18:44] this morning, that word which is the
[18:47] salt of the Lord is going to stay to
[18:50] each and one of us into into our hearts.
[18:53] Father, we thank you Lord and we bless
[18:54] you as we give you the glory. We pray
[18:57] father also for our pastor still going
[18:59] to come. Lord, I know that the enemy is
[19:02] planning also. He's got other plans,
[19:04] Father, for the word, but we destroy
[19:07] them now because, Father, already we
[19:09] have won before the word comes. And
[19:13] father, we thank you that we are more
[19:15] than conquerors. We are victors. Oh
[19:17] Lord, the Bible says, Lord, we don't
[19:20] have to fear anything because father, we
[19:22] are not alone, but we are coming with
[19:24] you. We thank you, Father. Bless each
[19:26] and everyone and bless the whole safest
[19:28] in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus.
[19:30] Amen. Amen.
