chapter 2 verse 5. I'm of course he always believe D verse 5. can you continue ladies I think Kings chapter 2 verse 5. and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elijah and said unto him know as thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy heads today and he answered yeah I know it is and no it's down that that we are the Lord will take away thy Master Duty from thy because the answer is he believed what they said I know yes all your peace to learn what did he know them is going to take you the master from your um I know that he's coming to take my master from my head to my soul because he was going to receive the mantle um whatever all this time was in his head you are supposed to be transferred to his girlfriend now that's why he said in order it will happen just beyond Jordan I will receive them in the spirit of Elijah right now let us just stand up for the reading of the way foreign and when the seventh of the men of God was released [Music] foreign Elisha you have missed the 17th again foreign you must always look for those that are with you amen the enemy is coming amen who is with you because the Bible says they who are with us I love this their servant could not see them he is himself and Elijah this is and now it says and fear not they who are with us just like Joshua it was Joshua and the good Joshua nobody [Music] yes amen when they look at the enemy but um from the enemy side you have the same thing this morning that is we should believe and this takes away fear out of us amen when the enemy is coming hello okay I love these scriptures and so now Manchester and Elisha prayed Lord his eyes okay amen amen even this morning we are saying our eyes yeah but he may see because the prophet was Prophet the word of God is but the servant the scones of ice for him to be able to see both sides who is with them foreign [Music] uh uh I want to have a prophet with me with me I want this one yeah Elijah that's why he says behold I will send to Elijah the prophet okay okay let us pray amen the word is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the way it was God and they were dwell Among Us and we saw its glory amen even this morning Lord we are here to see your glory because we know when the weight is manifested we see the glory of God we are not here only to hear the word but he we are here to see the manifestation as the prophet said when God said let there be light that was a wait but when there was light it was no longer a word it was not the manifestation what we need this morning is not just to hear the word but is to see the manifestation on the way that was spoken so we are so thankful Lord to be here that's why those that are sick if they believe they are healed because that is the manifestation it's not just the healing the word for healing is also manifestation so we are so glad that you are here to bless us this morning Father we have read your word we are looking for the manifestation as I

got cell phones in a muscle phone for communication from the pastors everywhere even on the streets hooked up on their cell phone and they are in a hurry to buy for the children without um and a child the moment he or she received the cell phone yeah I was telling their brothers they are always on this headphone amen Let It Be Soulful use soul food it says head that's why Elijah said I know that the Lord is going to take my master from my head is anger all right and of course the parents of today when they do things that are actually harmful to the children they think they show love um all right did you know that your child um I I was abroad ing early so we were coming down the road we see the session we were in your car we said a brother said to me that was crossing the robots yes they sent his children think of England or what else let's say I'm against that why he should do that nothing okay what for eign maybe to look for a job when they are hired [Music] only that for that very same subjecting when she went foreign but with Christianity Uma you'll find some clothes too residing in this area but he goes and attended somewhere else [Music] okay because closer to where he is

132 paragraph 132. and her life a prostitute she was all murdered was just a little bit of understanding what happened when the Messiah comes um technical thing inside there hello notice when Jesus came yes because the way to descend the thoughts [Music] the thoughts of her heart it comes against that seed [Music] yes that's how some of you came because I'm looking for this thing I mean [Music] this woman but none of them who could catch up with their souls um [Applause] because that's what she was waiting for Brother to go to church she was not waiting for to register anymore foreign that's

word was designer of the thoughts easily of heart and he came as the son of man what happened with only intellectual learning Jesus because that's what his denomination called it what did he do he had no representation so it blacked him out um nothing to present um [Applause] a representation will be amazing then listen now she was looking for this to be made [Applause] what is that Abraham Abraham heard their promise and he was waiting for it to be made and then still be so early in the Woody in the beginning [Music] so this woman was waiting for this word to be made flesh that's why she said yeah that's when that word is in the flesh which is okay that's why Abraham the same thing or Isaac to be made flesh firstly is the promise the word shall have a son it was good that's why it doesn't a young man yeah and she was looking around feel yes [Music] if she knew that um but she has already got one taking things into um we are surrounded CeCe today we are surrounded sometimes you are just
