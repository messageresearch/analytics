Description:
Title: The Migration Of The Citizens of Salem
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 16 April 2023 at Mamelodi Church South Africa.

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The Migration Of The Citizens of Salem. The Pastor read Hebrews 11: 8 -16 ”8 By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. 9 By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. 10 For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11 And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise. 12 And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. 13 All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. 14 People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. 15 If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.

 
Through the bible we only know of Abraham as the only man who met Melchisedec. when we speak of Abraham, it is to him and his seed. With Melchisedec there are two witnesses, which is Abraham and brother Branham.

The Pastor took reference from the spoken word 60-0221E -  Who Is This Melchisedec? 
65 When Abraham met Him, He was Melchisedec. He unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end, every son of Abraham. Every son...

[Music] it's not everybody who can do that I used to go to some dinner that that was before I caught up with the revelations and until I received the Facebook part of this evil age then I started to know that there is a message now every message leads you to the message it's rolling we used to sing this chorus tell me in my heart there is [Music] my heart my heart [Applause] once that wheel can

for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he saw John in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah her self-received strength to conceive sin and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore therefore sprung there even of one and him as good as did so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sandwich is by the seashore innumerable this all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them are far off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims of the Earth for they that say such things did live plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better account that is a heaven wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he have prepared for them a city amen well [Music]

expecting he has promised us I will read this part here Abraham Abraham you know why I picked up this is who else has met Melchizedek [Music] um apart from um do you know of somebody else let one person say yes because we were called in we have seen we met Melchizedek in Abraham I have listened to some sermon saying sermons [Music] there is so much scarcity of the name Melchizedek yeah [Music] there's evangelists but there is a huge scarcity of the name it is for the seed yes fella babe throughout the whole Bible I have never seen um foreign [Music] I mean I mean we even pay tithesis yeah even the trustees can tell you that they've been receiving our tithing from Abraham amen amen and no okay then name this happened in my soul here is something very serious who is this man and we looking at the Royal seat you're a relationship it's called The Royal season and as a citizen way we are looking at the word here [Music] um I will start here now and it ends up really if nature with the seed you find the city Abraham and his seat you'll find the seventh angel message who told me and you if oh you were online he said he met melchized amen I mean I have never hit one solar one person from hearing Abraham Ma um if God sends a prophet and he sends him together with the seed um the seed is already there he's just coming to reveal the seed that is already there is um I was having a page here Abraham and his I shall give this land to Abraham [Music] okay uh the seventh angel messenger who who also oh Leena said I don't know if you were you have seen it that you have only two witnesses okay [Music] um even if you can say to me hello Carmona brand name is a false prophetess I will say to you too you are too late you couldn't say to the seed of Abraham that Abraham is a false prophet we will be talking you'll be saying that to Abraham if you are see the sea only let's say wheat akure you have which is some seeds seeds coming from [Music] do you believe do you think that which can listen to you later pour the seed from the wheat and you say to it wheat is a false prophet do you think wheat can believe you now can you say to the Seed of Abraham Abraham is a false prophet from the Seed of Abraham believe me because you are talking to the scene now Charlie you'll be too late [Music] it will also speak like Abraham [Music] which is going away all right now let's look at the these are citizens then I will read you something here when I look last time that's why I said to your brother there's something about amen page 13. who is this is paragraph 65 more paragraph 65 it says Eric when Abraham met him Abraham let's just talk about this business about these things you know there's a time when he is called God there was a time where the weight was made flesh you say Jesus really Jesus okay amen this is what the people know I remember of this I think three sisters and I think it was a where brother the same brother who testified to them and they went they talked about melchized now it was for the first time to them it was for the first time to hear a preacher talking about Manchester United oh where I'm standing and bending a bit I mean so they went to their pasta and this was testified to me by they're saying [Music] then they said but hey we have hit something and he says that pasta it hurt you inside to hear that the people have now forsaken Jesus in favor of somebody call it Mel kisses amen amen it's things like that that's why you say I don't know you have foreign no you only heard about Jesus now listen now when Abraham met him maybe you can say when he met God when he met Jesus but when Melchizedek met him foreign [Music] he was looking for a city whose maker um [Music] so you see it was not for foreign [Music] okay let me read it when he met somebody he would say God but when Abraham met him because this one is a citizen so he made the king of the city he was looking forward I was told somewhere when I was visiting foreign okay I mean now now let's separate things yes when he meets somebody he would say I have met God but when he meets Abraham because this one is a citizens okay no then it says and he unfolds

unfolds this meeting unfolds what all the attributes like Abraham and this is you know even about I don't have the book here but even about the Seven Seals the seventh seals okay I can just quote he said at the final it will be revealed around the time when Jesus shall appear again we are so he said so at that time he said but it will happen they're coming Jesus that will happen can you be raptured without the seventh season come on and he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham son of the faith [Music] absolutely do the same thing what same thing amen then he go you continue after that he says Melchizedek then later or come around we never heard of no more he just appeared to um after that because he became Jesus the citizen of Salem now when he means I think somebody has said today an entire world to the others the savior [Music] but Abraham has been sorted out already [Music] amen then he continues he became Jesus there was no more mention of melchization amen amen okay then we'll pass here now before we pass here yeah heavy have you have you picked it up now let's Stir It Away all right we will let me continue um it's wonderful

reference foreign that their power that the resurrected Jesus Christ the Bible says it is by the same power the power of the Resurrection you know not because you're worshiping this church because you are a citizen speaks of the citizenship now if you are a citizen of Salem it is already in you brother Brennan says we're talking about the Rapture that is only waiting for the moment but he says

said Abraham I want to make you my child stop smoking stop drinking look that's not their nature their nature is to run around with girls and boys that nature why we call the love of God grace [Music] even ourselves we could be doing those things it is by grace you must thank God that he considered you amen with Abraham Abraham you know God loves to have people like him God wants to make us into his own fashion that's right he wanted David people like Abraham God loved him so much I mean I mean no that means if you are a child of Abraham you are part of God that's what Abraham is that right
