We have our December convention here. Now from here &gt;&gt; we're going to have another one of Easter as usual is that in every Easter service &gt;&gt; we used to have our services here. and then December will go to operator.

Elders still going to dish the word for to us. Let's clap the hands for the word. We'll ask our brother to lead us with a song. While we are asking our elder to come and feed us with the weight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice &gt;&gt; of the When he when he begin of God &gt;&gt; of God should defeat me. Jesus the prophet sent you before and rain and shall the hearts of their children to their Yes, I &gt;&gt; come. Holy holy holy power with power. Oh, well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.

I greet you uh once again saints in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ. I hope you have rested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are back &gt;&gt; to continue with what we were talking about. This morning I tried to keep time. Was I punctual? Oh, okay. I would like us to open the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; Uh, chapter 14. &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 14. I would like us to read verse 6. &gt;&gt; Verse 6. &gt;&gt; And then jump over to verse 9. vers 9 &gt;&gt; and jump over to verse 12 &gt;&gt; vers 12 &gt;&gt; up to 14 &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 14 &gt;&gt; Joshua 14 &gt;&gt; we'll read verse 6 &gt;&gt; then jump over to verse 9 &gt;&gt; then goes to 12 up to up to 14 &gt;&gt; Joshua 14: Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and Gilgal and Caleb the son of Jean the Kennesite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Gadesh Baner. Verse N. And Moses sw on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet had trotted shall be thine inheritance, and thy childrens forever, because thou has wholly followed the Lord my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. Now therefore, give me this mountain, wherefore the Lord, whereof the Lord spake in that day. For thou heardest in that day how the Anakings were there, and that the cities were great and fenced. If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeffon Hebron for an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jeffon the Kennazite unto this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let us just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; I will request our pastor pastor to just bless the reading of the word. Amen. Let us pray. Our dear mighty heavenly father, once again, we have gathered into thy presence. When we come into thy presence, we just not come. We are expecting our Lord to come and speak to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, there is our brother here. We know him is elder pet &gt;&gt; but he has read the scripture here. We are here humbly beseeching thee to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And take over. &gt;&gt; Take over this body. &gt;&gt; Use his voice &gt;&gt; and use the interpreter's voice. Father, deliver your tidings unto us so that when we leave here, we must be like the people who were going to immerse, we say, why did our hearts not burn within us when he was with us speaking? &gt;&gt; Lest our hearts b when you speak with us this afternoon. &gt;&gt; I pray in the precious name of our Lord, Savior, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be uh seated. God bless you. Yeah. Okay. We This will be just part two of what we're talking about. Uh this morning we we spoke about the inheritance and the possession and and the text is still the same that you beware of the delaying process. Okay. Amen. So I said this morning there is a relevant ministry and then if we have a relevant ministry any other ministry will be a good ministry. But uh it won't benefit the cause because what is important we need to check our course that we are on course and then there shouldn't be anything that will derail the cause. But now what is happening is uh during the time of the Old Testament. If you compare that with the time we're living in now, we we started by reading Revelation chapter 5. We read from verse one up to 4. from verse one and then speaking the the the the verses that we spoke. It was about the book that is written without an an insight within and without. And then there was nobody that could come and take this book. And read it and explain everything. I know that you all know about that. You've got an answer to that. But what I I'll try to bring in is this that as it is now the the seals have been revealed. Open open and revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if they are open and revealed, &gt;&gt; we know that and we have the revelation of that. But then what is the relevant ministry now at this time? The relevant ministry at this time is a ministry that would bring about the change of the body &gt;&gt; because we already have our inheritance. We got our inheritance and then we have reached the promised land. That's a &gt;&gt; uh we read this morning &gt;&gt; that now uh uh when they were in the promised land or or what what is our inheritance then we've learned that our inheritance is that now our forefathers deviated from believing the word of God. They were supposed to stick to believing the word of God. &gt;&gt; And then what they did, they lowered their gloves. You know in the boxing boxing &gt;&gt; they say your gloves must always be up here. once you can lower that second you'll be down &gt;&gt; because you are in a ring you're fighting remember now we're living at the end time and being on the end time the enemy is aware that he's got No chance. Everything is being finished. You you you keep the standard. You don't you don't lower the standard. You continue with the standard. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then our pastor, &gt;&gt; everybody can be a witness that he have done a very good job. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has taken us in. He has finished up everything. If we fail, it will be ourselves. &gt;&gt; He has done everything. &gt;&gt; So now let's compare him with with with Joshua. Now Joshua, they came to him firstly. They said now uh provided what was in Moses was in you. He proved to them that what was in Moses was in him. Then we've just read a scripture here where Joshua said, "Give me that mountain." So he said, "Now Moses promised me that. Now stick to your promise. I was 40 years then. Now I'm 80. I'm stronger than that time." Right? Amen. And then Joshua gave him. &gt;&gt; But remember that He pointed a a a place that has got enemy. &gt;&gt; But what did God say unto them? I read the scripture in the morning. He said now you must go and defeat them. That that is the word of God. That is the promise. He said I will be with you. You fight them. You defeat them. It's yours. I give you that. Please. Now Joshua &gt;&gt; and Caleb, stick to that. &gt;&gt; Now I pointed something in the morning about uh our uh about uh Adam. I will I will read something here. &gt;&gt; Uh it says here in this uh book an exposition of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; That's an epician church age. He says here the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God. He was given a bride to to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God. But he fell. hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. Are we together? Adam was the spoken seed word of God. Amen. He was given a a a bride to reproduce himself. Right now it says the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God and then was given uh also I mean sorry say sorry let me read it was given a bride like Adam &gt;&gt; but before he could marry her she also had fallen Adam did not backslide &gt;&gt; second Adam &gt;&gt; did not backslide We're talking about she here then. But before you could marry her, she also had fallen. She, like Adam's wife, was put to test whether she would believe the word of God and leave or doubt the word of and die. She doubted. She left the word, she died. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that's where now you come in because I was speaking about she some of you sisters started doubting yourself out. Then he said from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of his word. What makes her the virgin of the word? Because she never doubted the word. that makes her the virgin of the word. &gt;&gt; So the first two doubted the word and died. Remember that now Adam was a spoken seed word of God. Being a spoken seed word She can't backslide. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that backslided &gt;&gt; was the back a byproduct. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said in order that God should be a redeemer, he did that purpose. Are we together? knowing that he he can't be a redeemer without anything to redeem. And then he can't backslide because what he produces the seed word from a little group of the true and seed word of God. God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of his word. What is the meaning of the virgin of his word? It means she's going she's going to take the word as is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember now when it says the bride, it's referring to us male male and female. See the bride taking the word. Why? When it says seat word It means that the seed when you plant it, &gt;&gt; it will produce a seed. But before it produc a seed, it will go a process where it becomes stock and etc etc. But at the end it becomes the seed. So he planted the seed. to produce the sweet. That is why now that is the virgin. It's not mixed up. It's a virgin of his will. Now when you take the word of God as per promise that is what we call the virgin of the word because you plant it as it is. It has got life in it. Now Jesus Christ says the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life. Now the word has got life within it. When you hear the word of God that word find a place in your heart. And when it finds a place of blood, it produces itself. That is why Abraham makes the word. But by that but during that time the word was in a being and that being was Melkisedc. Then they started communicating speaking about the word. That's why the Bible says he &gt;&gt; gave Abraham bread and wine. &gt;&gt; Bread types the word. &gt;&gt; Word wine. It types the spirit that is himself. That's why he gave of himself. He he gave Abraham of himself. Now after taking that Abraham became himself because he gave of himself the word is a spirit and it's life. When it finds a place, it becomes the way and where it landed, it produces the way. Are &gt;&gt; we together? Now our inheritance is that now our forefathers deviated from the faith of the way. Now why am I saying that we must be careful that we should not have a delaying process? Because anything that is not of the word it will delay you because God cannot react. The only thing that attracts God is his own way. God is attracted by his own way and is attracted by a believer that believe his way. It's like when he gives a promise that promise is divine. Now he stick to that divine promise. The Bible says that promise is divine. It's precious and it's great. the great precious divine says now he gives you promises you you must go and read it in the book of Peter second Peter chapter 1 vers4 he says he gave you that divine promise and then that promise will produce itself are we together &gt;&gt; so Now, now it continues. Now, Christ will give you a beloved bride name. She is the virgin of his word. She is a virgin because she she knows no manmade creed or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God. All that was promised by God, it will be fulfilled through you. All the promise. Now you must know then that what has been promised it will be fulfilled through you. Not through your own power. No, it's through the seed that has been planted in you. The Bible says first John chapter 3 verse 9 says a child of God does not sin because the seed of God remains in him. Now that seed will produce of itself because that seed itself it's life. It's not you producing them. It's the seed that is in you. Are we together? Amen. So she is a virgin because she knows no man-made creed or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled will fulfill all the promise of promises of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word promise came to the virgin Mary. But the word of promise &gt;&gt; was he himself to be made manifest. Amen. The word of promise is that he must come and be manifested. It was a promise. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. Remember now, &gt;&gt; and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. Now after that promise arrived and John says this there's the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; It's like when the prophet said the way is now in the bride. Now the bride of God, thus said the Lord, he knows what to do with that, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And when she knows what to do with that, it becomes a mystery. It's mysterious to an individual. Look, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "I will give you a hidden mana hidden &gt;&gt; and then I'll give you a white stone. We spoke about the story this morning that now your name which is your new name will be rich in there. You are the only one. That is why it's a mystery. It's a secret mystery. It's a secret mystery because the prophet says the devil must not know. That is why even heaven was quiet. That is why even himself is not supposed to utter it. It's a secret mystery. yourself, you will be given because you eat from the hidden manner. When when you eat you, that is why I said before we started that it should be a a ministry that is relevant right to the time that we are living in now. You are the only one that is feasting on that carcass. &gt;&gt; You are the only one. &gt;&gt; You are the one that is is is taking in. &gt;&gt; Okay. Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word promise &gt;&gt; or the word of promise &gt;&gt; came to the Virgin Mary, &gt;&gt; but that was of a promise. That but that was of promise was that was that which was of promise was he to be made manifest. Like in John 1:18, &gt;&gt; no man had seen God at any time. &gt;&gt; The only the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father. He had declared it. He had affirm it. He had announced it publicly and officially. That's why he said he had declared him. The father had declared him. But then what I want you to notice that the Bible Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called wonderful right when he came his name was Jesus." &gt;&gt; Was not wonderful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So it seems to be a contradiction. counselor. &gt;&gt; He was not a counselor, &gt;&gt; but they could not see him when he's counseling through the word, when he's going to the synagogue and correcting everything. He went to the synagogue. He took the book and said, "Today, that scripture is fulfilled in your eyes. in your eyes. They expect they're expecting a certain type of counselor. Then you take that and bring it to our time. Then it says he's a counselor and then he's a mighty God. They didn't see him &gt;&gt; when he was expressing himself, &gt;&gt; when he was manifesting the mighty God. When he said when he walked upon the sea, when he multiply brave, when he raised the dead, when he calmed the storm, they could not see that is a mighty God. Even the very same one, the one that pointed him &gt;&gt; and said, "There's the lamb of God. When now the lamb of God was manifesting, they came to him. Said that lamb you were talking about. He started his own church. Then he said, "No, okay, go and find out." Go and ask him. He's the one that appointed him. He didn't say to them as he started definitely. I told you that I must decrease. He must increase. No. He said you go and find go and investigate and find out who who is he. And when they arrived, he didn't say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You came at the right man. I am the Messiah. &gt;&gt; He was the one that knows that was a Messiah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will perform &gt;&gt; what the Messiah Messiah was supposed to perform individually. You will see yourself. Because when he was performing the signs of Messiah, he asked them, "Who do you say that I the son of man am?" And then Peter said, "Thou art the Christ." And then from that day took the keys, I am through. I am finished now with my second pool. He did the first pool, walked upon the sea, and do all those. The second pool, he was with the Pharisees. He was with the Pharisees. He rebuked the Pharisees. And after Peter recognized him, remember that we're talking about the third pool. Now he was crossing over to the third pool. After Peter recognized him, he became an enemy. Then the delaying tactics came. The very same Peter, the very same Peter was given the keys of the kingdom of God. When he said, "Now, I'm going now to the third pool." Now, when he went to the third pool, Peter said, &gt;&gt; you know, his third pool was that I'm I'm going to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be arrested. I'm going to die. I'm going to resurrect. Now Peter and all the disciples remained delayed by the process because they said to him, Peter said to him, he called him aside and said, "Rabbi, you are backsliding. Nobody will touch you. Look at here. born. Nobody will touch you. And then what did he say? He saw behind him, not Peter. No, he saw a a demon. He said, "You there get the behind him." Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before he was arrested, he said, "Tonight, This is what going to happen with me. We are all going to be disappointed. What did Peter say? &gt;&gt; The one with the keys. He said, "Yes, these are going to be not me. Not me." &gt;&gt; Is when he says, &gt;&gt; "Uh, before the coke could grow, once the first time you would have denied me three times. &gt;&gt; Now he was getting into a third pool after he gave them communion. The Bible said they said, &gt;&gt; they had a hymn of entering now into the third pool, they sang after he said after the devil has entered into. So he start singing. Now then he said okay let's go and pray you guys you are saying there's nothing that will happen to me what does the pro promise say the promise says I will be crucified and I will resurrect the third day and I will meet you at Galilee let's go and pray you pray that I must not be crucified I will pray that let this thing pass on you sit here start praying you three come with me he hoped and said no in case of money stop and pray you can't pray against the word of God you rather sleep they do and slept what would they so he knows what is going to happen. They are against that. They started sleeping. I'm sure Peter said now and slept. Are we together now? Where was it? It was now on the third pool. The third pool was uh they've crossed over now. Where are we now? &gt;&gt; We are on the third point. We have crossed over. &gt;&gt; We have received our inheritance. And when we when Joshua &gt;&gt; gave Caleb, &gt;&gt; his place, what happened? What did he do with that place? Are we together now? We have the thirdful ministry. The third ministry is the revelation of the seven seal. The seven seal have been revealed to us. Are we having the rapturing faith or we are saying to Christ over our dead body will never be crucified? You know, Peter ended up influencing the other disciples against Jesus Christ that he is not going there. They all said no, you won't go there. Are we together now? uh I am saying here &gt;&gt; uh what is the benefit of the importance of the revelation of the seven se benefit of the revelation of the seven is that now we we will have the rapturing faith Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; A rapturing faith that will bring about the changes. There are promises that this and this and this and this will happen. There were promises that this and this and this will happen. And the Messiah &gt;&gt; will say tell no one. &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet say about the revelation of the seven se? He said it's not for the public. Keep it to yourself. I don't say keep it to yourself. What what is the value of keeping it to yourself? But if you have the revelation of the seven se and I have and the other one have we will know that we will be able to fellowship about that. We are at this era where now every scripture is manifested. Right, let's continue. God was made manifest. He himself acted at the same time and fulfilled his own way of promise in the virgin. That's what he did. He acted himself. He manifested himself. He fulfilled his own way of promise in a virgin. God has done that with us. He acted himself. He manifested himself. Now the the the the the the the uh uh the rapturing faith is when God has manifested himself in yourself. It was an angel that had brought a message. It was an angel that met Joshua. It was an angel that met E A Abraham. It was an angel that met Brother Brennan. It's an angel that met the bride. The bride met the angel. When he said, "No, have you met me?" He's speaking about that angel. And who is that angel? Brother Brennan. So the angel and he said this angel is noted. It's a notable one. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says now the notable one was the one that came to him. Are we together? Of all the seven angels that were flying, going eastward, there was a notable Lord together that flew to him. He knew that angel. And then what happened? That was his ministry. &gt;&gt; The the new commission, &gt;&gt; the new commission is the ministry of an angel. &gt;&gt; The new commission to Joshua was an angel that he met. The new commission to Abraham &gt;&gt; was the angel that he has made. The new commission to you is the angel in the form of the revealed word that came to you. The prophet met an angel. When he met this angel, he went eastwards. He went westwards and met that angel. &gt;&gt; Look, the pyramid of &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson &gt;&gt; had a white stone &gt;&gt; was deep down there. And when brother Brennham Brennham &gt;&gt; was going westward, he was going to get the interpretation of that of that wis. Then he went westward. And then when he went westward, he met the angel of that interpretation of that west. Remember that was a cornerstone. That was a cornerstone and it became a capstone to cap what the pyramid which are the seven church ages. And then in capping them he met an angel. Now we have met exactly that angel. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That angel, I mean when brother Brennham came back, &gt;&gt; he gave that h a book or interpretation or the sword or the revelation to the Joshua, our pastors, it is that angel. The Bible says or brother says a pastor behind the pullpit is an angel. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now when we meet &gt;&gt; the pastor behind the pullpit, we are not meeting an individual. We are meeting the word. That angel is that word. When when it's revealed unto you, it becomes your theopanop. that very so he met the constellation of the seven angels. Now each and every one of us belongs to that constellation. You belong to that constellation through brother Brennham because you are the product of the ministry of brother Brennham. So you are part of that constellation. Your pastor is the product of that constellation. He is in that constellation. And now he himself was the one that gave you that what you call it that that revelation, the word that he preached was revealed unto you. And when it is revealed unto you, you are the one that add from the carcass, &gt;&gt; the hidden manner at that it's it's hidden. It's a secret. It's a mystery. It goes in that channel. It doesn't move in that channel. Are we together? Because in the garden of Eden, it went out of the channel. When it went out of the it caused all the damage that were causing now it's in that channel. It's for that little group. That's what he said. I heard the pastor one day said, &gt;&gt; he said, "You know what? There are people that uh are are receiving the word." He said he said the word that we preach there are a a few people that he said he said we are not preaching to the church. No. Amen. &gt;&gt; We preach to the heart. You you heard him saying that. He says preaching to the heart. That's where the throne of God is. And in the time that we are living in like we have read here that now they have rejected the second Adam. Then when he rejected the second Adam then what did he do? Then he went to &gt;&gt; the individuals because the church age has closed down. &gt;&gt; So he's standing outside. He's knocking. The one that will open, he will come and die. Amen. It was an angel that brought the message to Mary. But the angel's message was the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Mary brought it, I mean the angel bring it, it was there. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now to scope or to have the scope of all events and to identify your dispensation. You you'll be able to spot your mark in your dispensation. You must be able to spot your mark in this dispensation. You must know exactly where you are. Put your mark in this dispensation. Where am I? Then you will be able to balance between the past and the present and the future. Then you'll be balanced yourself. You you identify first your your your dispensation. Once you identify your dispensation, But in which dispensation are you? Then you'll be able to balance actually where am I between the last days or between the future and the past then you balance through your dispensation. Otherwise without that you won't be able. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. the God of this evil age as we have read in the scriptures. Uh this message points out the evils of this evil day. Amen. This message, this message &gt;&gt; points out the evils of this evil age. We are in the civil age. The only message that can point out the evils of this time is this message. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And is fitting to prophecy for this evil age. It points out the evils and it can even feed the prophecies. You are the only one that will notice the promises that are for this day. You are the only one that can interpret what is exactly happening in Russia. in Russia, &gt;&gt; in America, &gt;&gt; in the Vatican, &gt;&gt; in in in in Israel, &gt;&gt; you know, you are the only one that you are the only one that understands that the world doesn't know what's going on. The whole South Africa doesn't know that. Now, the prophet says the evils of this age and it's fitting to prophesy for this evil age. Anything that is happening, we are the only one &gt;&gt; that could interpret this. &gt;&gt; He says, I'm reading God of this evil age. I'm reading paragraph 29. Amen. Right. Oh, no. Now I'm reading 31. It's a very strong thing to think that uh that in evil age like this that God then will be calling his bride at this evil age. It's unbelievable that God could call his bride. People think that God will call his bride when things are very soft, when things are going smooth, when things are are okay. God called his bride. this very evil age when when the Messiah came. It was at the evil age. &gt;&gt; That is why when he was born, he was born in a manger. It was very evil. They were killing, they were doing all these things. So when there was evil in the land that's when God now when people are delaying with concentrating on the evils what is going on when people now are saying hey manga or whatever it is or Russia is doing this this this this what you call God is calling his bride he is talking swiftly to the bride Because everybody says, "Where are we going now?" The whole world is what you call. Trump is is on us. Russia is on what you call them and everything. The churches are going mad. Everything is going out now. But swiftly, there is a small voice. A small voice to the bride that the brideal are the only one look &gt;&gt; the doubt descended. Scientists took it. They could not they could not interpret it until the prophet took it and turn it upside down and show them the face. You see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've got it right. &gt;&gt; It is there &gt;&gt; in Washington DC. But they can't interpret it. You the smallest in the group. You can interpret that cloud. You are the only one that can identify yourself in the scriptures. You can point yourself. Here am I there? I am the bride according to the word and according to this that is happening. You can interpret any movement. You are the one that can interpret what the devil is doing right now. Now, amen. He says, "Now listen, &gt;&gt; for Satan has not spoke of as a god of any other age than this is worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it. Do you know that &gt;&gt; they worship him unaware? &gt;&gt; But you are the attribute, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord's, you see the ministry. I mean, he says now you are the attributes. You don't remember it because you are just part of his life. You are part of God when you become a son or daughter of God just as you are part of your father. Then the attribute was the first one. That was the thought of God. The attribute itself all in one without being expressed without being expressed. Then when he expressed secondly, he become the weight. You are an attribute, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He became the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. So the bride is himself revealed. The word is in the bride. So the bride is himself revealed. The lamb broke the seals. and revealed them to his bride. And remember while they went to buy oil, you remember the scripture does not say they got it. They went to buy. Did they get it? Say the Bible doesn't say that. Now I'm about to finish. It says &gt;&gt; the bride went in. There's a whole difference between the church and the bride. Went in in the wedding supper. That is why now after we have received our uh uh the what you call our inheritance and then we had it in our position. What are we doing? So now that's what I'm trying to tell you that because we have our our possession now we are encouraged we are encouraged by notifying our promises we we we are relaxing there's a pressure that whatever is going on we identifying our promises. We relax on our promises. We we check that while we are relaxing. What is our promises? How should we react to the promise? The devil will try by all means to prove to you that there isn't a right church. This one is doing that. This one is doing that. But we are looking at the promise. The promise says, "I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against you." When the pastor was preaching the last time, he said when our Lord Jesus Christ was saying, "I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against you. He was looking right at the gates of hell. He was looking at at Cesaria Philippi. Go and check what is Cesaria Philippi. It was a city that was built for the God that was where now the gate of hell was. He was looking at the gates of hell shall not prevail. He was standing there looking at the gates of hell. Are we together? Now those things are not in the Bible. The Bible says our Lord Jesus Christ was from the coast of Cesaria. Cesaria. &gt;&gt; But what made the pastor mention that? Because he said he said he was looking at that then I grasped it. I went and go and check and when I checked I found that yes that city was it was city for the demons. Are we together in the morning we spoke about the two and tribes that didn't want to cross over that didn't want to cross over. The prophet says those people that didn't want to cross when Jesus Christ find a man &gt;&gt; in chains full of demons was it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says that place was those guys &gt;&gt; they refused to cross over &gt;&gt; Reuben. Who's that word? &gt;&gt; Get and the half of manas. &gt;&gt; They didn't cross over. They went. He said Moses said, "You don't want to go and fight. Your brothers must fight." And then they said, "Okay, fine. We'll go. We will leave our children." And those people. Brother Brham said, they never repented. Because they refused to cross. And Jesus came there and healed only that man. And the prophet says they chase Jesus away. Remember where he said now the demons must go to they they ask that the demons must go to the to the pigs in that place. It was the only person that was here. That's what the prophet said. So now it's a time to relax. But you cannot relax without your sword. The road, the way to the tree of life, the prophet spoke about standing in a gap. The prophet &gt;&gt; was praying. Just find out there's a sword in his heart. The prophet was praying on a stone. You find a white eagle right within his heart. He was on a rock praying. There's a white rock directly with his heart. I mean the white eagle. Are we together? And then he was praying. There was a sword in his hand. Now those are the things that are not written in the Bible. It's only can be interpreted by you. &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of scriptures. There's quite a lot of promises that are pertaining to you and the devil doesn't want you to go through them. &gt;&gt; So now You've got a position. The possession when you got your possession, this is what you you have to do with your position. You have possessed it. Now that you've possessed it, you look at all this one at this one. Look uh Caleb when he went to take that place, &gt;&gt; it was not a clean place. It had giants giants. One we a person with five fingers actually six six this side six that like see you have to carry his sword. He had a young man that will carry his sword when he's going to war. &gt;&gt; But but but uh Caleb, &gt;&gt; he said, "Give me that place. &gt;&gt; I will defeat them and I will take it." That's it. Amen. Then he was given that place. I always say, "Don't think you'll go to heaven on a rocking chair. Look at your promises. Have faith in a small thing. Then it will go bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how it is. May the Lord bless you all. God bless you. Amen. May God bless you, my brother. God bless you. Amen. Uh, &gt;&gt; God bless you. Well, &gt;&gt; oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Songs of worship. Uh my brother.
