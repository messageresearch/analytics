We greet you all in the name of our wonderful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Before we start uh our program, we want to invite him to come and lead the program for us. like to invite Pastor Freddy to come and lead us in prayer for us to start our today's procession. I heard that there is uh brother Mark around. Maybe he can come if he can help us to interpret for us the prayer from our beloved pastor. We shall pray. &gt;&gt; Father, which is in heaven, &gt;&gt; we are touched within ourselves. &gt;&gt; At the same time, we have the feeling of gratefulness &gt;&gt; because you are God. We are gathered here this morning &gt;&gt; for the funeral of your servant Israel. [music] When he was in your council, he experienced things and he decide he decided of things and he fixed of many things until you suffer that he assumes a human body. And here before us we have this body in the coffin. The person within this coffin is not a him but a him. The true him is the one that had been with you in your council. He decided to come and dwell in this body to leave a time that he that was allotted for him on this earth. &gt;&gt; Him that was a supernatural being. &gt;&gt; He that was a supernatural being. He came within this body in order to have an experience of this flesh, this body. Since the first day he came into this world, &gt;&gt; he started his journey here on earth up until the day he left the same body he lived in. And we've heard of the marvelous things, &gt;&gt; his character, &gt;&gt; the nature and the attitude, the sacrifice, &gt;&gt; the sacrifices. And every single one of here of us here, we recognize that he was sent by you, &gt;&gt; Lord our God. service. &gt;&gt; We would like to dedicate the service into your holy hands &gt;&gt; because uh it was not useless. &gt;&gt; He was never useless but he was always useful. He was useful for his biological family. Useful for useful even to all the other sister churches. and he did that which you purposed in your counsel. That's why we are so grateful to you and we are confident that in this long journey he is right now in a dimension in a dimension where there's no case there's no worries where there's no pains where sickness cannot creep in. He is right now in the glory. He is in a joy. He is in a feast. But we that are left here on earth, we have griefs. But through the teachings that he left us, all the teachings they comfort us and we have the assurance that one of these days we will go to meeting up with you and that shall be a great joy. That's the reason why we're calling upon your name. We're calling upon your presence and we pray that everything that shall be done, let them be done under your control from the beginning to the end in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have so prayed and asked for your glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you &gt;&gt; with so far. Thank you my brother for coming. &gt;&gt; Uh we may just have our seats for some welcoming words. &gt;&gt; Beloved family. Beloved family. All the pastors, the dear pastors in the house, all the elders of the church. We would like to greet you this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We extend these greetings [snorts] to al the body of Christ who are connected to this event from all the corners. We also honor &gt;&gt; the invisible audience and the heavenly host [snorts] that are with us this morning. We have gathered here today with hearts that feel both heavy and deeply grateful. heavy because we have lost a father, &gt;&gt; a husband, &gt;&gt; a grandfather, &gt;&gt; a leader, &gt;&gt; a brother, &gt;&gt; a brother, &gt;&gt; a shepherd and a pillar among us. grateful because God gave us the privilege to walk with a man like Pastor Israel. Pastor Israel Kodima was more than a pastor. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; To many of us he was a mentor to others a counselor to many more a father in the faith. He was a man who built people. who believed in potential even when people did not yet look like anything. He built a ministry from nothing to something that today stands strong to something that is impactful. visible and undeniable. &gt;&gt; We are witnesses of the fruits of his labor. He was a pioneer, a man who walked path that had not been walked. He faced battles many would have run away from but he did not retreat. And we want to tell this morning that we will also not retreat. He fought with wisdom. He fought without wasting ammunition. He understood timing, discernment, and obedience. He didn't fight to be seen. He fought because he believed that the kingdom of God served his life, his strength and even his tears. Yes, he sacrificed much. He gave of himself sometime more than what we could see. He placed the work of God above personal comfort. He carried burden so other could stand free. I can say he was a deliverer. He paid prices that only heaven can fully record. &gt;&gt; He finally shared him with the world. He finally he his family shared him with the world. and for that sacrifice. We honor them today [applause] and that is with deep respect. Pastor Israel taught us not only by his preaching, but by his life, the way he served, the way he forgave, the way he loved, the way he disciplined himself. His life was a message. [applause] He woke, his work was a sermon. His behavior was a mentorship school. We learned by watching him. As we always say, life of great men has taught us. &gt;&gt; The legacy that he leave behind him is is one of that we cannot afford to compromise. I want to repeat that. The legacy that he leaves behind is one that we cannot afford to compromise. It is a foundation that demands continuation, not imitation. It calls us to stand, to build, to love, and to serve as he did to carry forward the vision that outlives any one person. So today, even as we feel the pain of loss, we also stand in honor. We honor a general in faith, a father among fathers. A leader who led with integrity. Thank you. A servant who never sought a throne. As we begin this service, let our hearts not only moon but also celebrate. Celebrate a welllived life. Celebrate the soul. Thank you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Celebrate the souls he touched. Celebrate the ministry he built. Celebrate the God he faithfully served. May the God of all comfort be with us today. May his peace rest upon the family. May his spirit lead us as we continue to walk in the legacy of Pastor Israel Kodima. [music] God bless you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I wanted to welcome the audience with these few words and I believe that we will have a great time together to pay a great tribute to our great general in faith. Just for protocol I have been given a program here to run. We will try to stick to our program and make sure we keep time. We will have uh various friends and items that will come here just to help us stand strong. We insist that each one who will take the pulpit here to respect this moment with us. Shalom. Let me start by asking in the audience here all the pastors if they can just stand on their feet so that we may notice them and welcome them with umbrella of applaud. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May God bless you men of God for coming to honor this moment. for these tributes that we are paying for his wonderful life. We want to thank you. May God bless you richly. You may take your seat. We understand. We understand that we may not be able to call all of you here for the sake of time, but we know that your presence here is a blessing unto us. We want also if I can do that to ask the the family, the children of the pastor our mother and the grandchildren just so that the rest of the audience can notice them as we are beginning the service. Everyone who's here already. Okay, those that are there can stand. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, like we always say, we pastors &gt;&gt; that sometimes a church can replace a pastor, but a home cannot replace a father. We want to be here in support of this family. We want also to appreciate the elders of Mamelo Church for the great ministry that they have helped to drive and the entire church that has been pastored by pastor Israel Kodima.

Greetings. The one speaking is the nurse who was taking care of I met first at MRI clinic and then I was then nurse. connection and I had a connection. There was no other nurse that she wanted but me. He was a humble or a righteous man. A man who loves the people. He was the patient that we loved the most and he also loved us. &gt;&gt; He was a very wise man. He was able to lead your thoughts when you coming to him. He's someone who would guide you if you do something that he doesn't want. He would bring you something else. So he was a humble man. I was with him as a man of jokes. I was a nurse at clinic. The way he loved me, the family even went on to request me to take care of him at home. I was also taking care of him at home. &gt;&gt; The last time I saw him, it was when he was admitted at ministry. I then saw his family outside. &gt;&gt; I was told that he was admitted in the EU. &gt;&gt; I went to greet him again. The reason I stopped going home to take care of him wedding, &gt;&gt; I was getting married. I had to go and do some preparation for a white wedding. I requested the family that because I am I'm about to get married, I would like to go on with the preparations &gt;&gt; and then stop going to going to their home and they called me back again at Ministry and I were making arrangement that I go back home. That's when I met at midstream when he was in ECU. &gt;&gt; He was happy to see me. He said, and then I said to him, are you used to call him? He always had a smile. I say to family, &gt;&gt; it's it's not the end. May God comfort you. Wonderful man. I was also saddened to hear that left us. I am deeply hurt. I do not have much. I am just head. &gt;&gt; I say be comforted you. &gt;&gt; I will then go sit down. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause] Is sister also coming? Sister is she coming? Then let me have Dr. Dr. Mab &gt;&gt; Dr. Matabi I I greet you this morning in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Special greetings to the pastors. May the good Lord bless you. And I would like to greet all those grandfathers, grandmothers who when pastor they had his ministry, they were young people. But now they are old people. Those people are the kind of people who pass good messages managed to preserve them managed until now. And then also I greet also special greeting to those young people those ones who when they came into the ministry of pastor Kurima some of them were born in the message. Some of them were five seven years old like I I was but now they are husbands. uh wives, successful business people through the min ministry of pastor and also a special greeting to those young people. You know, miss you as transgenerational. That is why we have all this why we have all kinds of people, the young, the old, the middle-aged. Yes. So special preaches to those young people who through the teaching of pastor they you know brother says loudishia is the grandest of all ages. It is the most sinful age and because it is with the blending of time and eternity now through the ministration of pastor. He gave them the kind of ministry that could take them out of theian church age into the bride age. Yes. ministries that he used to preaches topics like end of the seven seal center point of the revelation center point of the revelation the flying interpretation getting to the extreme he is coming up going to where Melkisedc is So you are a wellfed church. You are a wellfed church. Well looked after through the you know sacrifice efforts hours of sacrifice that the pastor put you know I I I think I'm one of the people that he loved the most. I I see there's no amen there. But let me but as much as he loved me and as much as I loved him, he loved you just as much. So you are a privileged people. Now in those few words I would like to add my my talk about my acquaintances and my expressions about the pastor. You know he was my spiritual his physician for more than 40 years. I was his physical physician maybe for 15 years. about 15 &gt;&gt; now you can't compare &gt;&gt; I remember there was a time when he came to me because I wish to see him at least monthly if not twice a month wouldn't pass without me see him now one day he says you know my son you've been coming here you know I I just wanted the the trusty to organize something for you because where I come from I traled 250 coming back. But now it dawned on me and said, "Look, if my soul is worth 10,000 words,000 now, how much will I how can I charge the pastor? How much if he can say you know your worth your soul is worth 10,000 words and I'm looking after you need to pay me. &gt;&gt; How much you know how much am I going to be able to pay you so I couldn't do it. So I just came there because of the love I had for him and the love he had for me. Amen. And me and him, we had a special bond. You know, we'll spend countless hours. I'll come to examine him. But I'll spend almost the whole day, maybe examine him for 30 minutes, the rest of the fellowshipping. So I count myself lucky very fortunate you know pastor his life you know everything about him was worth based based on the word of God even if you are a doctor to approach him must be according to the word if it's not according to the you wouldn't take it. Now that is why he was a difficult patient to manage. I I remember one day we he was tired. Then we decided uh no pastor I think you need to decrease your consultation. So he just looked at me. I said, "Oh, okay. All right. Okay." And then the next week he went into his office. The elders have put a note there. Today we are going to have a few consultation maybe two. We're going to try to manage it. Then he said, "Hey, who put this thing? Just take this thing off." Yeah. Let the people come. That is how much he loved you. Now the next morning I phoned him pastor how was it yesterday? Oh, he said, "Yeah, no. Yesterday we had a good time. You know, we were fellowshiping with the children of God. You know, we were there. You know, there were people coming." I'm like, "Pastor, okay, pastor, what about Oh, no. Don't worry about that. We are doing the work of the Lord. You he put you first. That is the kind of pastor he was, you know. Like I say, if you don't do anything according to the word, he wouldn't take it. I remember there was one time also now he was worried because for his work, his life is just the word living for Christ. You know, he was the epidome of you know there is a song that we call rejoice in the Lord. He was the [music] prime example of that. Smile. You will know that smile. Every time you'll go there, you will have a smile. He was always happy and happy when he was doing the the works of God. I don't remember a time when I came and he was not at his desk reading his books, reading the spoken word, reading the Bible, he lived the messages he preached. Yes, you you could see now you know brother says you know I believe that we're approaching an hour &gt;&gt; where missing limb missing limbs a limp missing limb missing limbs will be restored his message was that kind of a ministry when pastor days. There was a time when he prayed for a lady and that lady didn't have hair just cut the hair and immediately the hair started growing. It is true. I witnessed it myself. There was one time during my mom was sick. Now the we I was nursing her. I was in ML and she was here in in breast and we gave her some medication, some treatment. She she kept on going down and then my sister in the morning one day phon me. Mom is sick. So we added pulse oximter. Now we check the saturation level. Now saturation level was about 64. Now normal it must be at least 92 and above. Now I was in there I had to drive because I needed to take a back for to admit. You know how the devil works. Now while I was supposed to go one of my patient had complication. Now I had to take it for an operation to do a seizure. Now that means my journey now which was supposed to be 3 hours of four or five hours. Now the situation was dropping. Now I called my sister and I said call the pastor and they called the pastor you know gently over the phone. She prayed for my mom. The saturation level went up from 64 &gt;&gt; 28 some 88 from 88. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you. It's not a joke. It's something that happened. Now when I went home there, my mom was well just I just took her home, you know, just aditted her just for precaution. But she was healed. Now his message was that kind of a ministry one time I visited him after he came from hospital he was in bronos pray it was me and then we just woriing you know fellowshipping just this sweet spirit around that house you know you know the kind of sweet spirit where the holy spirit is there now we're worshiping with him there now is she then he asked about the granddaughter Rego then what after asking Rego came in now she came in and she said she went to the father and said can I have a pill you know I've been having this terrible headache it just doesn't want to stop now because that sweet spirit was Now I ask if you are a Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz &gt;&gt; and you have an engine breakdown, where do you go? &gt;&gt; I know you go to Mercedes-Benz garage. &gt;&gt; Now you are sick, where should you go? He said, I must go to God. &gt;&gt; So where should you go here now? Then he went to the grandfather the grandfather just touched the head immediately you know at that time ah you know I was a son fellowshipping with the father I did not want to be a doctor at that time I saw the pastor just put hands on it and they had a meeting stopped that is the kind of ministry Oh brother. Amen. What a great man. Humble man of God who loved the people. You know everything about him was we work based and then he rejoice more when he was doing the works of God. You know after praying for you know he was just thinking you know he was so happy he was no longer a patient and that is how all the time we used to meet him because when we met him we just fellowship talk and then that smile you know that smile you know contagious smile that he had it did not matter whether he was in He will always have that smile joy in the Lord all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I remember one time you know I will say something maybe it might mean a bit controversial or something. You know one day we went to visit him while I was with pastor Kuchingal is here is there then we went into the room now he was in bed now while lying there he had drips all over now he he said hey brothers because the the the room that he had there was a window in front of it He said, "You know, you know, I saw the new Jerusalem coming. &gt;&gt; Now we became quiet. &gt;&gt; You can give the pastor the mic." He said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, after he said that, We were quiet. You know why we were quiet? There was the pastor in bed. Drips all over. And he seen the new Jerusalem. Oh, &gt;&gt; we say maybe the pastor is going now. Now we didn't say anything. We were just shocked. Now he turn toan. I said, "You see, they don't believe me. Maybe you believe me. It was not because we don't believe him. It is because of the way we we didn't we loved him so much. We didn't think it was time for him to go. But he stole it. Now he was that kind of a person living in two worlds. That's the kind of person he was. And one day I was with Aquilla. Oh Aquila, may the good Lord bless you. Yes, now he phoned me in frustrated you know said you know I've been with a pastor he doesn't want to take his medication you know he's just there watching documentaries rejoicing now I had to teach him you know there's a child being yeah that's how the pastor is now wait for him because he's in another person now. Whereby you that person doesn't need medication? No sir. No. And now if you give medication, he's not going to take it. Just cool down. Put it next to him. When that face passes, he will take his medication. Yes. They say I'm stop but I have so much you know. So that is the kind of person he was. Now in closing I would like to thank all the people especially the doctors the nurses who looked after him from the moment he went first in the hospital Dr. Ford who was his neurosurgeon &gt;&gt; Dr. Ford Dr. Bas &gt;&gt; Dr. For &gt;&gt; who was the neur neuros neurologist &gt;&gt; and then also special thanks also to the doctors in in mystery med clinic. &gt;&gt; Dr. Angel his physician drundas his cardiologist Dr. &gt;&gt; Dr. Tabang his palmonologist &gt;&gt; Dr. Tabang his palologist &gt;&gt; Dr. La his nephologist Dr. &gt;&gt; Nephologist &gt;&gt; and Dr. Mushua Dr. He's a urologist and all the people who involved all the nurses, the physotherapist, occupational health therapist, all the nurses, you know, when he was in the world, it will always be cool. All the nurses, you know, he had this spirit about him wanted to pass there. Now, in his final days, I remember we the last time I saw him. We we went to his house. We were just fellowship with him with pastor with him you know he was just happy but he didn't have any appetite then after they left you know even fellowshipping you know singing the song he was even fellow we have seen the wonders of the gospel &gt;&gt; that's why I say he was a an example an epitome of what a jewel being Yes. But rejoicing in that is the kind of person. Now when I saw him then I the pastor they left I spoke to him you know we tried to f him you know that is you know you will never understand how God works because that time when we sent him to the hospital the last time he was not sick as he was the other time it was just precautionary because he was just vomiting not having an appetite From there I I realized that maybe there's something wrong with the kidneys. He must be having uric gastritis. Then we sent him to the hospital. No, all the other time ambulances came to take him. But this time he was walking on his own when he went there. Not any you know not any pain in his body. That is how our pastor left no pain in his body. You know, if you are a child of God when you go, you don't struggle. You just sleep. Now, our pastor is not dead. He's asleep. He has child changed dimensions. This is just his body. You know I was composing at that time saying you know Omar remember that time in when he has that hair around him that black hair that he loved. If you can just take a picture of 1964 1965 that is how he looks now. No pain in his body. No drip that he needs. Rejoice him forever. I wonder what they are doing up there. brother, all of them. Oh, I wonder how the reception he got. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wonder. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless uh brother for all the great labor he has done for our pastor. I believe there is also a place there [snorts] for him. Uh before I call uh pastor Freddy, &gt;&gt; I want to call a song item by brother uh Monty. &gt;&gt; Brother Monty Maki, he was supposed to sing yesterday but due to electricity could not do it. So he will come to give us an item when we are expecting to hear also a short testimony from Pastor Freddy for the missions of pastor in Africa. Do me see &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So [singing] see me [music] go See [singing] my coy see [music] me just see [singing] You miss me [singing] [music] by my way to see [singing] me [music] go see [singing] my &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Father [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, now Make [singing] cocon. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. [singing] [music] [music] [singing] I get confused. [music] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] I will fall. [music] I call the Lord [music] Father [singing] Se [music] [music] [music] to When I truth [music and singing] See how to mech. [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; again. You [music and singing] again [music] [singing] see [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; See all [music] [music] to me. See to me. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Say to me [music] [music] to me [singing] to me [music] to me. [music] Oh my god. [music] It's so good to be [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to invite Pastor Freddy You know, Pastor Kadima's ministry and life was beyond the borders and the building of Mamelo. He went into towns, townships, &gt;&gt; suburbs. He had no limitation. He did not look at color. Did not look at nationality. He did not look at age slot neither social status, public domain property. I think in the the early 2000s 2000 &gt;&gt; he had covered a lot the Sadc region Malawi Swazilandana Zambia Zimbabwe Zimbabwe you could find his footprint all then came pastor and pastor Freddy and they took him to to the central Africa in the Congo and from there he discovered the other parts of Africa and Pastor Freddy was behind that he brought Cameroon he brought uh Togo &gt;&gt; and all these places that we went I remember pastor used to say that's why God made him tall so that he can see the way and we can follow. So we wanted him at least to say something about what has happened that side just in five minute. Amen. God bless you. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom church. &gt;&gt; I pastor. I happened to know pastor at the very same time with pastor &gt;&gt; it was in the days of the dedication of amen tabernacle the pastor zakola's church the manner in which he brought that study &gt;&gt; it kind of touched my heart it vibrated in my heart. &gt;&gt; And I say that this is another reflection of me. &gt;&gt; And it's ever since we got close together. When a pastor organized a meeting in the Congo, &gt;&gt; he associated me to that program. That's how we got acquainted. &gt;&gt; And I wondered and asked the question to myself. &gt;&gt; This ministry was never a local ministry. And I said to myself that I will cause others to benefit of the grace that God had planted in this man. &gt;&gt; That's how I happened to be in touch with the elders. &gt;&gt; For example, brother and the elders and we took offer together with pastor. We started a trip &gt;&gt; and I took him to Africa in a Frenchsp speaking country. &gt;&gt; He was such a humble man. &gt;&gt; He was not a confusing man, a complicated man in his life. &gt;&gt; And he released life. He was a kind of man who lived everything that went out of his mouth. He had a big heart and uh avoid repeating myself &gt;&gt; or repeat what other side &gt;&gt; because everything that was said behind the pulpit is the truth. When he came in the Congo, I had nothing on me. &gt;&gt; I had nothing on me. I was uh still a tenant. I was hiring a little renting small house and I loed some few sisters in my house. But after his passing in my church and he simply broached the word. He never spoke of things such as a prosperity. He simply preached that which he was used to preach. &gt;&gt; As he came back here in South Africa, &gt;&gt; we noticed we noticed the prosperity getting into our church. He is such a man who blessed many men or servants of God. It shared grace with the men of God, servants of God. &gt;&gt; Like my elder said that last night, &gt;&gt; he said he asked a question to now that I I need to meet this guy. The very same question I asked myself and I asked him a question, what shall I do in order to meet God? He told me that the simply observe the way things are moving on. As we walked together, as we walk together, there must be transmission of God. And that word really touched me and had an impact on me. &gt;&gt; And I could see that everywhere he was welcomed by my friends &gt;&gt; whether it be in Brazville, &gt;&gt; Cameroon, &gt;&gt; Libraville, &gt;&gt; Libraville, Ben, &gt;&gt; Benin, Togo. &gt;&gt; He was a such a blessing. &gt;&gt; So we're not going to forget him. Don't forget him swiftly. Keep in mind that God had given you a great gift. So stay with the teachings that he gave you &gt;&gt; and stay together &gt;&gt; and that God will look after the the rest. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless bless Pastor Freddy. uh we have been in many meetings together with the pastor and him in Africa. The pastor was really a blessing. Yes, we have many much to say but time will fail us like the Bible says when Paul was speaking time will fail me. If I must speak about these warriors of faith, it won't be enough time to speak about the life of pastor. Let's get to uh we want to have a tribute. But before that, I don't know if Pastor Maka is ready to speak on behalf of the local pastors. We would like to have him say something. He has done so much by the side of Pastor Israel. God bless you, pastor. Amen. Thank you, Master of Ceremonies. Protocols observed, I greet you all. [applause] As they have written here, as they have written here, the local pastor. &gt;&gt; I don't have a speech. But what I have &gt;&gt; is we the family, &gt;&gt; the church, &gt;&gt; the board &gt;&gt; of Assemble and it sister churches. We are deeply humbled by your presence. and your words [applause] and your words of comfort therefore of have comforted us and if this thing emerge on the way I think your presence and your word of comfort will also emerge. And when they emerge, they will comfort us. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you so much. [applause] God bless you, Pastor Ma. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Um, I want maybe have an item from the final voice, Captain Park. They will come &gt;&gt; final voice uh bishop will get ready. So after the item then he will come to uh give as he was requested a tribute for the life of our precious pastor Kodima some music and play in the meantime just to relax our minds in the presence of the Lord. How many are happy here to celebrate? We are celebrating a life well lived. Amen. Maybe we can have one song while they are coming. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Main wood class. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; see More [music] [music] Males. [singing] [music] [music] [singing] [singing] [music] Yeah. [music and singing] [music and singing] [singing] [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. I'm longing [singing] for you. And [singing] someday [music] on me [singing] I'll stand there. My [music and singing] hope shall [singing] be eternal. [music] New land. [singing] [music] Sweet land. [music] I'm kind of hoping [singing] for a country [music and singing] to which I've never [music] been [singing] before. No s [singing] And [music] goodbye. Will there be [music and singing] spoken for time [singing and music] will matter anymore? [singing] [music] to the [singing] land. [music] I'm longing [music and singing] for you. And of [singing] thee [music] I'll stand [singing] there. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My home [singing] shall be eternal. [singing] You land [singing] sweet. [music] I'm [music] loing [singing] now across the river [music and singing] to where my faith shall end inside. [music] [singing] Oh, there's just a few [singing] more days to labor. [music] Oh, [singing] and then I'll take my heavenly [singing] life. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I'm longing [music and singing] for you. And [music and singing] someday on [singing] thee I'll stand [music] there. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; My home shall be [singing and music] it shall be eternal. You [singing] are lamb [music] sweet. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just another round of applause. &gt;&gt; I believe we sang this song with Pastor at our homes and I I believe today it's a reality for him. We praise the Lord for a welllived life. Pastoring can come tribute. Brother interpreter, can you please come? still have two or three items &gt;&gt; before we get to the closing of our service. &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord more tonight, this afternoon, this morning? Please, we love the Lord more than ever before. Thank you. Good microphone. It's with the pain in our hearts that we express ourselves here. &gt;&gt; When we learned of the departure of pastor Israel Kodima Uh we were so touched affected but uh it is our great joy to know such a lost he is not lost but he is resting. avoid what others side to say what others said. &gt;&gt; Pastor to us he has been &gt;&gt; he has been a step leader. &gt;&gt; Thus was such a great ministry. when a pastor Freddy spoke to us about pastor. &gt;&gt; It was during a great uh convention. Uh it was in 2015 or 2014 somewhere there. Uh we we took a flight all the way to to South Africa. And I would like to say that should I claim to have known South Africa today it is through or thanks to pastor Kodima &gt;&gt; and if we today know each other you and I through pastor the first time that I had a chance of listening to him. Listening to him left me with such an impact in my life and we did the utmost to have him in libriv that had a chance of traveling to Libraville. Pastor Freddy, &gt;&gt; for example, Pastor Freddy &gt;&gt; in Libraville, we had a small building, &gt;&gt; but after his passing, his visit, &gt;&gt; his first trip to Librivville as I'm talking to you today, should we count in Gabon the biggest temples? Should we count two of them? We are amongst the biggest temple in Kabon. &gt;&gt; Thanks to the blessing, &gt;&gt; thanks to the blessing of the ministry &gt;&gt; of pastor Israel. I have much appreciated this ministry. Last year we happened to visit to be here. We happened to visit him while he was sick and we happened to uh speak with the entire family that is which is here today. Please bear with me uh for what I'm about to say for the next two three minutes. Uh to me as we spoke last year, it was like a farewell [music] because the manner of our communication and the way or the manner in which he responded, it was the same month, November last year, almost the same date. &gt;&gt; I spoke to him. I spoke to him about his ministry &gt;&gt; because a ministry does not go off does not go out. &gt;&gt; Even Paul of old. Paul could say to Timothy that Timothy my son that which is in you was in your great grand as we we it must be that as we see William Brham uh the ministry from William Brham onto Joseph and I can tell you today I can tell you to be honest my father was a pastor &gt;&gt; and his ministry fell on came on me and it continues even on my children. &gt;&gt; I have a son who's a great preacher and he had passed through here and I prayed to the Lord. I my prayer to the Lord is that the gift that was in pastor Israel let the same continue within the family the master continue within the family his family a ministry is not barren it might fall or come on one of his sons according to God God's own description And I say this to the church. &gt;&gt; May we stay united because we've seen things whereby a pastor passes on. But even before the pastor gets buried, we could we've seen things such as a fight of who will take over. Uh this one this one says I would take over. Another one over there got his own ambitions. No. The Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that led, the very same Holy Spirit that led Pastor Kodima. &gt;&gt; May the same Holy Spirit leads Melody Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; but the politic, &gt;&gt; no politics, &gt;&gt; but the group, &gt;&gt; no, separated group [music] with intentions, &gt;&gt; let me emphasize on this. It takes the Holy Spirit. It takes the Holy Spirit himself &gt;&gt; to lead me. &gt;&gt; We don't want a politics. &gt;&gt; I landed yesterday at 11 p.m. &gt;&gt; Uh because we got delayed. We came straight over here. And after we here, &gt;&gt; but I say this to the church, &gt;&gt; do not to you the church, you do not forsake this congregation. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, do not abandon the church. &gt;&gt; Never abandon the family. &gt;&gt; Never abandon pastor's family. &gt;&gt; Never forsake the pastor's family. If you are ever been a blessed &gt;&gt; through the ministry of this man than this man God has given him his first church &gt;&gt; which is a family and after you. &gt;&gt; So all together we building up one block one church. You should never forsake this family. &gt;&gt; Honor this family. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we as Africans, &gt;&gt; we as a black &gt;&gt; after the departure of the pastor, the widow goes through hardship with the children. Let it not be the case. The family of the departed pastor should never go through suffering. &gt;&gt; Is the family of our prophet suffering today? &gt;&gt; Did she suffer after the children all the way to the grandchildren? Are they suffering? &gt;&gt; We happened we had a chance of visiting them. You should see the church today. They are supporting that family. This is a testimony that I'm giving out. So the pastor's family should never go through suffering. &gt;&gt; His wife should never suffer. His children should never suffer. The church should all be around them to guide him. Who knows? Who knows? &gt;&gt; If a God could be so kind as to raise up one of his sons to take her over. If we claim to love Pastor Israel and if we claim to have respect in his ministry. I fear not to say it. I'm not afraid of saying this, but I say what I believe to be the truth. If we claim to love, &gt;&gt; if we loved him, [music] and that we love his family. May we pray for the Lord to continue for now. [music] &gt;&gt; Let me stop here. My &gt;&gt; my condolences to the entire family and to the entire church of Mali Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; God bless you, pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. May God bless our pastors. These pastors have these pastors they have really honored the life of pastor Israel and we are so thankful unto them. Uh I think I have one more item here. Um we want to give uh now the space for the grandchildren. Uh we know how much pastor was attached to them. We can start by hearing from them a musical item and then they will have we will have a speech by children and grandchildren. Amen. We arrange the microphones there. You starting with the song or the speech the song first. Okay. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; The [singing] other day I passed [music] the place you always like to go. And I picked up [singing] the phone because [music] I thought [singing] you'd want to know. But I [singing] forgot you were in there. I [music and singing] miss you more these days. But I'm reminded [singing] [music] of your smile and the funny things you'd say. [singing] [music] Knowing [singing] we can spend a life [singing] reminiscing on [music] the past. Knowing [singing] I will see your face again [music] with tender [singing] moments last. [music] It makes [music] me want [singing] to go there [music] knowing I won't be alone.

Though [singing and music] I have felt you many times, I [music] know you [singing] saw me through. I've always [singing] longed to [music] feel your arms and [singing] look into your eyes [music] and talk forever. [singing] You and me somewhere [singing] in paradise. [music] No, we we [music and singing] can spend a liime reminiscing on the [singing and music] past knowing I will see your face again. [singing] What's in our moment's [music] land? [music] It [singing] makes me want to go [music] there knowing I won't [singing] be alone. [music] Knowing you'll be there [singing] makes it easy [music] to go. [singing] [music] knowing we can spend [singing] a liime reminiscing on [music] the past [singing] knowing I will see your face [music] again with tender [singing] moment in Makes [music] me want to go there.

[music] [singing] [music] [music] You can join for for the speech. for this speech. [music] It says here children and grandchildren [music] or they have their own song. The grandchildren have Oh, okay. It's fine. [singing and music] My message [music] go [music] I get [music] [singing and music] Awesome. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; again. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] I'm so [music] I greet you all in the wonderful name of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. My name is Mulu used to call me Bobo. My grandfather used to call me Bobo &gt;&gt; and I think he believed that's my real name because he never knew that I'm leveling losing has been the most difficult and surreal experience of our lives. We know and believe &gt;&gt; that he's alive and we mourn knowing that we will see him again. But parting with him in this dimension is it's just too painful. We have been privileged &gt;&gt; and favored by God &gt;&gt; to be blessed with such a phenomenal grandfather. &gt;&gt; While serving the bride globally ensured that our childhood [music] and upbringing was one for the books. He made it a very memorable one. &gt;&gt; We lived about five, it was a 5 minutes drive from school to home. And normally we'd walk home, but there were times when he'd say to us, "That you and knowu he takes his own sweet time and he'd get there after school when nearly all the children have left. But he was going to take us on a drive. We always knew that when he came was going to take us to Roslin and get his mail. And then we'd get takeaways. &gt;&gt; But on the drive, don't you dare sleep because you're going to get the pinching of your life. He was convinced that Mercedes-Benz is the best car manufacturer in the world. You were not going to win that fight. And while he's driving, it's like he's eyeing all these BMW and if one of those drivers just look at him, he'd think they're provoking him to a race. Andu would be all in spirit and he'd be racing to &gt;&gt; and he'd always win. Um taught us excellence. Excellence. Muli taught us excellence. &gt;&gt; Excellence. If he gives you a task, It's either you were going to do it right or just don't do it at all. We knew that when we when we clean was coming, he would always say to us, "If I come and check these books and I find them skew, then that means your brain is skew. So he always taught us that the product of your work &gt;&gt; is a reflection of your brain and this is something we've carried on even in our work ethic at work. He taught us spiritual warfare. Mukulu had so many different people coming at home with so many different spiritual issues. But he was not scared to say, "You're going to sleep with this person in the guest house." Mind you, the guest house is isolated from God and we just witnessed we just witnessed this person being possessed. Now, &gt;&gt; now we are told but it was a way of him showing us that what is in him is also in us. I was a very timid person. He taught me to walk in the dark. &gt;&gt; He wasn't aware, &gt;&gt; but I would always wait on the visitors cuz we always had visitors almost every day at home. So, I just waited up so that he doesn't have to come from down from upstairs and lock the the gates and open up for the dogs. So every time the visitors would leave, I would go lock the gate &gt;&gt; and I would have that excruciating walk to go and open up for the dog in the dark. But would always be just standing upstairs there by the gate and I'd walk go and open up for the door. and come back and it just wake me good night go. That's how I learned to walk in the dark. He paid attention to detail. Appearance was very important to him. So when you would see him walking on the pullpit looking all smart, we had a pageant back at home. He would parade and model for us. And he'd want our view. So if the outfit was very nice, we are very careful not to give him too many compliments. If you give him too many compliments, he's not going to wear it. um he'd buy us like big packs of snacks [music] &gt;&gt; and even when he's busy, &gt;&gt; he would pack little packets for us to take for lunch. Uh &gt;&gt; I remember when I I was pregnant with our first baby Um, my face was so bad. I had pimples all over and it didn't bother me that much. I didn't talk to him about it. &gt;&gt; But when I got to him, just looked at me and he held my hand and he's like, "Your face is going to be fine." Miraculously, I didn't even go to a dermatologist. My face just started clearing up. He he took time to learn his grandchildren, our characters, our different personalities. And if you're not okay, he would be the first to detect it. He would approach you and be like, "What's wrong? What's bothering? Talk to me." He was so caring. Whenever there was an announcement for an outreach in the service &gt;&gt; and the children of God are rejoicing and we are all happy he's going to spread the gospel. We were the happiest of all the congregants. Yes, we love that he was spreading the gospel, but we knew that every outreach meant we get money. So every time would go let's say to Congo he would take his time to sit down take different envelopes write our names put in different amounts in those envelopes and when he's about to go board his flight we'd stand in a queue and he would dish them out to us. That's why we were happy for out. &gt;&gt; Oh, he was very funny. &gt;&gt; Um, when you see his grandchildren being slender, it's it's not a physical matter. It's spiritual. He would jokingly say to us, &gt;&gt; "The reason for my weight loss, &gt;&gt; it's because the scriptures say, "Narrow is the way. Straight is the gate." Amen. And oh, straight is the gate. And if you want to go in the rapture, you don't want to be squeezing in. So that's why we we have no choice. We must be sli so much fun with us. And um Mukulu had this game he called. &gt;&gt; So he would have us have us like pack like do a tower of our hands. But he was always taking advantage of us cuz we were young. So he would always have us put our hands first so that he could pinch us harder. And we've always been trying to avenge ourselves to find a game, but we haven't done always win. He would do bicep lifts with us, run with us. Coming back from running his errands, he would come park his car, play the music loud, and call you to come and dance with me. He was such a good listener. If you ask him money, you don't ask twice. Sometimes he'd be busy with visitors the whole day and then whoever asked him for money could fall asleep. Mulu wouldn't forget. He would take that money, put it under the mat at his door knowing that when he wake up in the morning, he'd be asleep, but you'd still find what you asked for. &gt;&gt; He was nurturing. Nurturing. He was nurturing. He even when he was preparing for sermons, he would take the time to cook for the family. While he's cooking the spiritual food, we also get he encouraged us to work out our salvation, not to depend on him or have him as a crush to heaven. And we always knew that if we aligned our lives with the word of God, We'd never disappoint him. Had a great influence on our lives. We were never rebellious teenagers. We don't know what adolescent is. I believe he prayed over our lives. That's why we are who we are today. We never had any fallout with but when it came to Zand's music, he'd always be upset with us because we we didn't like that music and he loved the music. You'd find us laughing at the songs. falling asleep and he would take offense. He would tell you it's either you get out and go downstairs or you sit here and drink. That is the only fall art we used to have at Mun. He took in other children from different families. He treated them like his own. He never segregated anyone. He never discriminated anyone. He wanted each and every one of those children to experience how it is to live with a godly character. Mul's end goal was all of these children to accept the Lord Jesus Christ. and he wanted to live it and he wanted us as well to live it. He was so proud of us. He loved us. He loved his great grandchildren so much. We shared a lot of milestones with even little things like gossip from school. He was so interested to know what's going on at school. Who's doing what? And we'd always sit and tell him all's love language was doing acts of service. All our lives, every day, Mukulu would show us that he loves us. And in the last call that we had with him, he said to us, "I love you guys." That was the first and the last time we've ever heard utter those words. We knew he but that day we were so happy together. I consider him as a gentle giant. He was well known globally but very humble. If he walks into a room, his presence is felt. He doesn't even need to say much. And as much as he dedicated most of his time to the bride of Christ, he never neglected his grandfatherly duties. He never neglected his grandfatherly duties. He taught us to lay our treasures in heavenly places and left us with an eternal inheritance by living his entire life for Christ. He may be out of sight right now, but his passing has encouraged us to deepen our roots in the word of God. that we can be able to meet him again. Amen. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Shalom saints. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord, Savior, and eternal King Jesus Christ. You know, I have a lot to say about the pastor, but I'll be brief. [snorts] &gt;&gt; When I started being in front of the pastor, [clears throat] I was attending. So, I love my pastor so much. Almost my entire So before he was my pastor, he let us go and visit the anchor. And I was surprised in that room there was a certain photo. Then I asked the pastor, "Uncle, whose child is this one? Because I don't know her." said &gt;&gt; the mother came here because she couldn't bear children. &gt;&gt; I prayed for the mother and this one is the firstborn in my heart. I said there it goes. I didn't believe &gt;&gt; I then started traveling with him together with all this old man &gt;&gt; I was asking myself one thing they 2 a.m. One day I was with him in the kind I said uncle tell me these old men don't they have their own families. He said no you don't understand their pastor and then I adise them here and there not knowing even I myself I'm going to cry unto him having my challenges and then he guided me &gt;&gt; and led me to the Christ. while I'm traveling with him together with elders and while he praying for the people then I learned and discovered something that the gift of healing is not where I was attending church before it's present in this man &gt;&gt; then I got baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus from there while he was praying for the people. It didn't matter. He always had that faith the Lord will make this people to an extent. tell me not knowing whether to address him as my uncle or the pastor. So I remember when the apostles the disciples then &gt;&gt; I remember typing a storm &gt;&gt; about the disciples when they experienced the storm &gt;&gt; and then when they called to him they say master &gt;&gt; then one day in that upper room &gt;&gt; the other day I went in the upper room That man always &gt;&gt; I met the pastor with his smile shalom. &gt;&gt; And then shalom master. &gt;&gt; How are you sir? &gt;&gt; My brother all is well. That time he had slept 5:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; attending to the ship of God. So I thank God for letting me see beyond letting me see beyond him as just a relative but as a servant and loyal servant of the Almighty God. And then we are all witnesses and then a Bible at the same time. In closing, brother a Christian is a God dwelling. the Holy Spirit and then the Holy Spirit in our hearts there is a Holy Spirit who will also love one another and then through that love it behooves us all things that we do testify no rather our actions will H testify to everyone else in the world that we had a pastor sent from God. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shalom church. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; All the elders in the name of Jesus Christ. All our sister churches in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, God is still God. My name is Sheron Rosen. I'm [clears throat] the firstborn pastor is I don't have a speech because I can say a lot. I can talk for the whole day and about my father. He was my father in the natural &gt;&gt; and also in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; But I found myself to be leaning too much in the spiritual side. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because my father &gt;&gt; when I started staying with him in 2019 &gt;&gt; most of the time upper room you will say the things I'm telling you the perfect &gt;&gt; I tell them to the perfect &gt;&gt; so the pastor has taught me I don't have every time the child is sick. He told me, Sharon, you must arrive to the state where I am and have what I have. And then and he told me about the quotes that if he's a sick person, &gt;&gt; here is a quote. &gt;&gt; When the child is sick, &gt;&gt; pray for the child and she'll be healed. &gt;&gt; My father gave me he gave me a military a spiritual military. What I like to tell the people that is a training military training &gt;&gt; even if he has departed because on Monday when he was talking to me telling me a lot he didn't tell me much but he told me he was streaming and he saw me at church. go OSM under blessing for me. Go OSM under pastor blessing. He said to me, Sharon, you must just hold on &gt;&gt; because he's coming back &gt;&gt; now. I believe in my father beyond the time and there's no one we have seen his life. My father has lived for God the whole of his life. And the prophet &gt;&gt; prophet says &gt;&gt; beyond the of time &gt;&gt; you enter beyond the curtain of time &gt;&gt; perfect love. &gt;&gt; So it means my father he had love he saw God. We also saints you must have love. so that we can meet our pastor again. We as his children, we must have love because if we don't have love, we'll never see our father again. And the church, the same applies. Let us love one another, saints. The Bible says, if you don't have love, you don't have God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [music] Greetings to everyone in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I also wanted to write something but I didn't know what to write. The other day I stood at the tabernacle. I'm giving thanks to God for healing the pastor, our father. But he healed him physically. Today I'm standing again to thank the Lord again for healing him completely. Uh what comforts me is that he taught us that you get you can get sick &gt;&gt; and then you get healed &gt;&gt; and live longer &gt;&gt; or you get sick and God heals you completely. So I'm glad that this soldier he fought a good fight and those who know him um God first &gt;&gt; stated last night that he drove alone all the way from in the northwest &gt;&gt; to Malawi. I am allowed &gt;&gt; just to preach. &gt;&gt; And that time at that moment our mother was supposed to go for a medical procedure but then he continued to pack his bags and said God first and he said I'm going to serve God. While serving God he will heal your mother. And it happened exactly like that. And um fast forward to to the Monday before his passing. I also visited him with um Reu, my daughter with my daughter. So we arrived very early around 9:00 a.m. He called to to his bedroom. So I found him with with um when arrived he called her. &gt;&gt; He was very happy. &gt;&gt; He was um extremely handsome. &gt;&gt; I know he's handsome. But that day and so he stayed with in the bedroom for the whole day. I remember walking to the bedroom And I asked him, "What are you doing?" &gt;&gt; He said to me, "I'm looking at the city." &gt;&gt; And so the the screen was on. &gt;&gt; So I thought he was looking at the city on the screen. But after his passing, I realized that no, he was not looking at the screen. And that same day, Um so um before the Monday &gt;&gt; he's been telling us that um he's organizing a big conference conference and it's a reathering that's the all the pastors will be there in December and he was telling me you need to prepare for the pastors make sure there's enough food for everyone. especially the pastors. I didn't know that he was talking about this. &gt;&gt; And I believe this is the conference he was talking about. And that Monday, I'm going to be short pastor that so um he he didn't want to eat. I tried to give him food. I tried to give him water and he said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; I don't want food. &gt;&gt; I don't want water. I want He pointed up." &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, I just want to go." &gt;&gt; Then he started singing. &gt;&gt; He changed the song. my my my situation &gt;&gt; and he said and said my situation &gt;&gt; it will not continue the same &gt;&gt; and he he sang the song &gt;&gt; and he said join me let's sing &gt;&gt; and asked sister to join him &gt;&gt; and he said let's sing the last &gt;&gt; we played he started dancing We danced. &gt;&gt; We joined him. &gt;&gt; And when it came to um the part where it says &gt;&gt; this temple, &gt;&gt; yes, this temple and then he will say this temple with a smile &gt;&gt; and he will say very soon this temple &gt;&gt; and then he'll just laugh. After singing, he spoke to to he said, "You need to listen to me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven. You wait for Jesus &gt;&gt; because I'm going." And he said, "Um, listen to what I'm saying. I'm going to heaven." Little did you know that he really meant it this time. And um I also believe that our father is not dead. It's not that we are strong. &gt;&gt; It's just that he taught us that God is God in all the situations. And even in this situation, we are sad that we won't see him again. But we are very happy that he's in a better place. And as my sister said, &gt;&gt; we also believe that we will um stick to the ministry until rapture. God bless you. [applause] Okay. Um there was no song. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's we are done. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's just give them a round of applause &gt;&gt; and encourage them uh the family that has been around our pastor. He has produced. It was his first church. you're first the pastor of your home before you pastor to others. I think there is a speech of Omar the the wife of our beloved pastor and uh our mother. [music] So for us not to just disturb her, I think the speech is given by the family to pastor Salm so that he may come to read the speech on behalf of sister. God bless you. Amen. So uh uh I've been uh asked to read for mama and uh this message she addressed directly to her husband because it's entitled to my husband. I just read Rabbi daddy my father. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you that you were part of my life. You taught me to know and fear the Lord. You never compromise the word. I will miss you physically but spiritually I am rich. Even when you are not here physically but your theophony body is operating in your house. You left me with an angel Michael &gt;&gt; who was visible when they come to kill you. I'm going to miss our fellowship that we used to have together about the eastern gates, &gt;&gt; Mount Olives, Mount Olives, &gt;&gt; River Euphrates and the prayer you always say for us. on the world and Lucifer knows you. I will always hear your footsteps at the upper room, your wife Maggie. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We are so thankful to the Lord that we have come to this day. We thank every pastor who [snorts] made himself available for this homegoing service for us, especially the pastors who had to take flights from out of the country. I just want you to give a round of applause for them. They have made us to feel special. They also did treat the pastor in a very special way. I know every time we have traveled out of South Africa, we have been always received like diplomats officials. They have always arranged state protocols. Sometimes I I remember we land and there is a car that come at the door of the aircraft. I believe brother is my witness. We want to say thank you pastors for all that you have done for the the ministry of pastor. I know here it is only a jacket. &gt;&gt; It's a suit of the pastor that is here. &gt;&gt; Himself is not here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh we welcome the rest of the pastors that I would like to mention here so that I pass the service for the closure and the word. &gt;&gt; Amen.

God bless you, &gt;&gt; Pastor Nathan. Pastor Nathan, &gt;&gt; Pastor Syama from Esadini, [music] Pastor Joseph Beana from Port Elizabeth. God bless you. This is Pastor Mintosh Marza, Pastor Edin Mala, Pastor Paladi, Pastor Paladi, Pastor Shija from Tanzania is represented by his son, brother Antipas. &gt;&gt; Brother Antipas Pastor Jimmy Matani from Joshua Tabernacle Johannesburg would like to say something. &gt;&gt; Pastor Minga David from [music] the North Tabernacle in Cape Town. Profunda from Malawi, Pastor Jeffrey Mabaso, Pastor Maher from Benoni, Pastor Maher. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Pastor Alen Badinga from Gabon Lraville.

Um I think we are done. &gt;&gt; You did not read my name. &gt;&gt; Oh, Pastor David from Fmpton Park. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So we uh as we are getting to the the word. I hear a request from the minister that is it pastor can be given one minute or so say something then we are going to pass the service for the word of God. So far we have done we have done it so good. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; as it was planned. One minute to pastor Pal then we are going to hear the consolation the comfort that come from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Are we tired? No, we can't be tired. Like pastor Madiva was saying yesterday will preach for 4 hours. Perhaps you've already heard and I and he says not and he says not John or surprised never feel anything is out of place when praises and good ways are said about a man that has laid to is laid to rest. In fact, this is the better time to speak about anyone who is doing well. Many times when people are still alive and much is said about them, they they pick up some complex. But &gt;&gt; Jesus says about John, &gt;&gt; he says, "No one born by a woman is greater than this man." But then he brings a a big problem in my thinking. that the least in the kingdom of God is greater than him. friends. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; The brother you're talking about, when I hear there were criticisms from many other pastors, I knew they had never lived close to this man. When Pastor Kurima tells you of the things that he experienced, You get so captivated into what he is saying and one thing you are going to admit we are not on the same level he spoke of one of the experiences I think speaking about when they were passing SS or SNS I don't know And these are not things that you read in the newspaper that you hear on daily news. And whatever he said and whatever people say and all that they tell, let us admit friends. God has given us differently. And if he has given more to my friends, I have no reason to be jealous. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But here is here is a gateway. &gt;&gt; The list in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many people are included in this. The speaker Christ I can count him to be among the least. Because he says, "My God, my God, why hast thou for a choir in the message believers speak about somebody born in 1909. 1909 and what you read from what they say and perhaps I'll say it in the lyric they are singing it alone forsaken by faith and by man till an angel came down so he would understand he was God's chosen man. God bless you. Amen. We can say indeed that we are the greatest beneficiaries, the life, the gifts and the character that was in pastor Israel. I believe uh the end of his body is not his end. The body can go away but his ministry will continue. the angel of the Lord who has been around him who will continue supporting each and everyone in the body. We will really him. We will miss him but in the spirit the power that was around his life continue controlling. I know the best way we can feel some consolation, some comfort in our hearts is by listening to the word of God. So now I think we need to stand on our feet as we are going to invite the minister of the day, &gt;&gt; our precious pastor. Amen. as we can [music] as they are fixing the stage here. Can we just have a song that we invite our pastor on the pulpit? Let's just open our hearts. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord has something that he will say unto us [singing] that will strengthen us so that our pastor can be lay [music] in its last place. God bless you. But in the days [singing] of the voice of [singing and music] the and a child when [music and singing] She [singing] is [music] so [music] [music] [singing] [music] He [music] prophet [music] [music] [singing] shall take the house [music] of the father. So my children [music] [music] I [singing] [music] [singing] Holy [music] [music] [singing] Ghost [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] [music] holy ghost. Amen. [music] Amen. I greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm going to greet again. I greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we appreciate the Lord today. Uh maybe unbelievers would wonder why would you appreciate the Lord during a funeral and we want to tell them a believer does not die and You can't box him in a box. You can put his remains in a coffin. But the realtor, you can't put him in a coffin. If he was here, &gt;&gt; he was going to tell you, &gt;&gt; I rotated of God. Then I took this body, but this body is not me. I left the body and the got together to put the remains in the pot. So he's not in the box. He is a young man &gt;&gt; in another dimension. This is a downgrade. But has been upgraded. He's a young man. There's no sugar diabetes way. There is no hospital way. He is in the presence of the saints. Amen. I believe he must have walked in and pastoral said now he has arrived the likes of brother the likes of brother all the likes of brother they must have had a corner and that I'm here our message will make you arrive. I want to repeat. Our message will make you arrive. Our message has got an answer to death. Our message has got an answer to the grave. Our message has got an answer to hell. That's why this morning we are not shaken. I was wondering when we were in the hospital. The doctor came to us and he said he mentioned a very striking phrase. He said to us, I'm going to allow you to sit. Don't sit. We want to read the scripture. But but the family can sit, but you remain. The doctor was begging us. I say release him. Then I was wondering why is the p the doctor asking us to release him. Do do we have the power or not have the power? But then later I realized that there is a sister at Brenham Tabernacle who was told that she was going to die. But later based on what she did then it was said that she will not die. Then I realized the doctor believes that our prayers can hold the pastor. He had to ask us a permission that he let him go. Then we gathered around the beds and we had a prayer. I've seen unbelievers die. They scream at the top of their voices. But I saw this old man peacefully transitioning. As I was talking to him, he kept on nodding. I say, "You taught us the seven seal, then he nodded. You taught us the revelation of the son of man, then he noded. You taught us the resurrection. You You taught us the rapture. Then in no time, he slipped off." So pastor is in a better place. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you pastors. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy &gt;&gt; chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 6. &gt;&gt; Verse 6. &gt;&gt; Is brother harvest here? &gt;&gt; Brother &gt;&gt; to help us read. If he's not here, we will read. &gt;&gt; Amen. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. &gt;&gt; As we bow our heads, our gracious heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here is a scripture that you have read. We depend on your anointing. And here is the family, friends, the congregation, pastors who are here. Lord, they've spoken and we're comforting one another. But Lord, the word is the greatest comforter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at this point in time, we commit the reading of the word to you for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly as you take your seats. We will not be long. &gt;&gt; In no time we are leaving. &gt;&gt; I was looking at this words for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand. And when I was reading these words, I know they were spoken by St. Paul, but when I was reading these words, pastor came to mind because if you hear from the speeches, his departure did not take him by surprise. He was ready to go. He was willing to go. He was not afraid of death. Then Paul says my the time of my departure is at hand. Now we find that death is a departure. We find that death is a change of a dwelling place. We find that death does not change you. If you die being a crook, you remain a crook. If you die being a believer, you remain a believer. If you die being a liar, you come back as a liar. And let me maybe take it further. When you die being a prophet, you still are a prophet. &gt;&gt; If you die being a pastor, you are still a pastor. Pastor is still your pastor. Death did not change him. But death change his dwelling place. I hope we are together. The prophet of God says showing one thing that men when you die or whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change this morning this afternoon. Our sermon is not intended to change anything. It is just to confirm who pastor was. It's just to confirm that he was a believer before death and he still a believer after death. It is to confirm that nothing has changed about him. If he was loving, he's still loving. If he was forgiving, he's still forgiving now. Nothing has changed about pastor. He just changed a 20 and the prophet says if you are a liar now you will be a liar. If you are hotheaded here you will be here. If you are a doubter here you will be a doubter. And if you are a believer here, you will be a believer here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says men and women, it's time to shake ourselves to examine ourselves. Pastor is gone. But I want to speak to you because he left a big shoes. You know, we have been fortunate to have crossed paths. with such a great man, a man that has labored not only for two years, for over 50 years. &gt;&gt; And I'm standing here. I'm looking at families that came under this ministry. I'm looking at young men that came out of this ministry. I'm looking at young women that came out of this ministry. I'm looking at pastors that came out of this ministry. I'm looking at congregations that came out of this ministry. And I don't know how many of you say I'm a trophy of pastor's ministry. I want you I'm not ashamed to say that I am a trophy of pastor's ministry and I believe there are witnesses here and I believe the pastors in Congo they can say we are the trophies ministry the pastors in Malawi they can say we are trophies the pastors in they can say we are let me tell you something when a man has done great you must acknowledge what a man has done don't become don't become jealous some of you you were not born when pastor was boarding a bus some of you you were not there even some of his critics were not born this man has labor this man has kept the faith not for 5 years after over 50 years. He still kept the faith. Today this afternoon we want to celebrate Pastor Israel. We want to acknowledge the labors of his love. Paul says, "I have fought a good fight. Maybe just to you know young ministers they think that a ministry is when we are wearing microphones &gt;&gt; and cameras are running lights are on songs are going on. I've got sad news for you. It's only 10%. A lot is going on behind this scene. Every time when your pastor comes to preach, you would have fought many battles. When you see your pastor behind the pulpit, you must know that it's victory. Here I'm talking about real pastors. I'm not talking about t collectors. I'm not talking about Sunday collectors. I'm talking about bonafideed pastors, pastors that have got rebellion for the people on their hearts. So pastoring is a warfare. I thought the pastors will say pastor pastoring is a warfare because one day uh somebody tells you pastor God has spoken through you God has spoken through you next week there's the same person I said the devil spoke through you and when you are a pastor you must be able not to be affected by compliments and even by critics because you are focused is the master. I say our focus is our master. So pastoring is a warfare against sin. Sin is unbelief. So that means pastor for 50 years plus he was waring against sin against unbelief against despair against erosion of the truth. And I believe many times pastor stood behind many pulpits with his body ache. One brother was telling me and said there was a time when he was sick. He spent most of the time standing on one leg because another leg was painful. What made pastor to do that? Constraint him. It was not money. He looked at the people and say I'm their shepherd. I'm going to preach for them when I'm happy and when I'm not happy, when I'm sick and when I'm not sick and I want to say he has never failed in his post of duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; He cancelled &gt;&gt; through the night. &gt;&gt; Then in the upper room, time stopped. You were not rushed. Your matter was attended to if it was attended until the we hours of the morning. The man of God was there not rushing you attending to you. Why? Because he loved you. I want to say to mommy church, your pastor loved you. Don't believe anything else. He named his sin without flinching. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; He named s without sin. Without flinching. &gt;&gt; You know, you'll bear with me. Pastors, a lot of pastors, if sin comes in their family, They look the other way. But they would ask his family, not this man. Sin was sin. Whether in church, whether in another family, whether in his family, he called it out. Why? He was a man of integrity. He fought for marriages that were on the brink. &gt;&gt; He fought for teenagers teenagers &gt;&gt; that were wandering far from home. Whenever you went to his house, you always found a new face and they say, "Pastor picked up this boy from somewhere." Because why? He was a parent. He was a father. He had a feeling for the people. He fought for widows who had nowhere else to call. And I want to say to challenge the trustees. Pastor believed that if the roof of a widow is leaking, it does not need to pray request. We don't pray about it. We do something about it. That's what pastor believed. He fought battles in many hospital hospital rooms. Some of you he visited in the hospitals. He even fought death itself with a weapon of Malachia 4 gospel. Now today I want to ask a question. Oh death, &gt;&gt; where is your victory? Death has no victory. And pastor proved that death has no victory. He fought well &gt;&gt; because he fought on his knees. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says &gt;&gt; and this is particularly to the mud church after the shepherd is gone the devil goes on the rampage. But I want to assure you the God of pastor will be with and he will finish what he started. If the enemy comes, believe me, the enemy will be defeated. And the enemy is not your brother. The enemy is not your sister, but the enemy is Satan. And I say Satan will be defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he fought the good fight. Brother Brennham says, "And real true battles are not made with selfish motives. Wars are not fought for money. Wars are fought for principles. None of them included money. All included principles. And I want to encourage the church. Keep on on that trajectory. Fighting for principle, not for position, not for power, not for members. fighting the enemy which is Satan. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "When Abraham went out to get Lord, &gt;&gt; he didn't go out because he know he could whip the kings and take their possession. He went out for the principle of saving his brother. And I want that Abrahamic material must be found in Mord where you are fighting for principles, to save your brother, to save your sister, not for your recognition, but to save one another. He displayed selflessness and we want to see the church displaying that value that he has displayed. I hope we are together. Second Timothy 4 7 Timothy 4:7 &gt;&gt; he says another phrase &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. would have never left until God's purpose with his life is fulfilled. Maybe let me read this quotation because I want to say something. The prophecy in the unveiling of God, it says notice then we become part of him. As as you are the veil that veins him, we're going to repeat this. As you are the veil that veils you, you are a part of him. As long as Christ is in you, Christ was of God. If God was in him, we made him God. And as Christ is in you, the hope of glory, you become a part of Christ. You become part of Christ. As long as Christ is hid in you, then it's it's a veiled to the unbeliever. But you know he is in you. You are templing Christ. that's behind the veil is the skin because of this veil. The veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever. So we are talking to the believers here. You know Tommy Osbborne, &gt;&gt; Tommy Osbbor &gt;&gt; during the memorial of brotherh Brennham, &gt;&gt; he says, "We have heard about Jesus Christ that walked to the shores of Galilee in our generation. Jesus Christ walked to the streets of Jefferson. What was happening? William Brham became a faith of God in our generation. And I am not ashamed that in our generation in this area we have seen Jesus Christ behind a simple man. He walked the streets of Modi. He walked the streets of he walked the streets of Switzerland. You will only believe it when it applies to you. When Christ is in you, you will know that he's in another person. We have seen in this day Jesus Christ walking in human form. &gt;&gt; That one is not for unbelievers. This is for the believers. Do you believe that you are the veils of God? Do you believe this was a veil of God? It was not pastor preaching to you. But it was the Lord himself. He hid himself behind a listen to me. In this generation, we see a man coming and he speaks a broken grammar. He says to the people, "I'm not much of a preacher." But we, the predestinated seed, we the elect when he was speaking the broken grammar, we went beyond the broken grammar and realized that the same God that was with Abraham, he has come again in our generation. And I want to say blessed mommy. You are pastor God hid behind him. Paul says &gt;&gt; I have kept &gt;&gt; the faith. People don't keep the faith anymore. What is our faith? It is the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Paul says, "I kept that faith." Let me let me I want to say something. Brother Brennham says in our generation we have three head planters. He say we've got Oral Roberts &gt;&gt; and we says we've got Billy Graham. Then he says we had the we had the word planter. Now listen to me. He says oral Robert &gt;&gt; was for the Pentecostal &gt;&gt; and Billy Graham &gt;&gt; was for the denomination. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Billy Graham Bill was a man of God but he was not sent to the bride. His ministry cannot change a body. His ministry does not have the rapturing faith. The ministry of Billy Graham, &gt;&gt; great as it was, it does not have the rapture faith. But listen to my statement. Three seeds have been planted in our generation. Pastor I have known him for years. He would have never taken He would have never he would have he would have never taken the sermon of Billy Graham &gt;&gt; to come and preach to no no because why his influence it was not from oral it was not from Billy Graham it was remember the two went to Sodom. But another one remained with Abraham. And when he remained with Abraham, he says, Abraham, where is Sarah thy wife? What was happening? It was not in sorrow. It was not among Janice and this was a thirdful ministry. This was God in flesh. Then Sarah &gt;&gt; when he heard Abracale &gt;&gt; promising that according to the time of life I shall return and thy wife shall have a son. Who was that? Who was that in the house of Abraham? The same one that was in the house of Abraham in our time. He was in the house of sister. &gt;&gt; And today the same one has not gone back. He is here. Amen. Yes sir. Because we are bearing an elder here. I can address ministers. Leave TD J alone. Leave Joel Austin alone. They've got no material for the bride. &gt;&gt; The material for the bride is withhal. I mean, if you're a minister and you come and preach to us, woman, thou art loose. What nonsense is that? That's a Pentecostal thing. Stop bringing sermons of Pentecostals, dressing them with message calls. Here is a man. 50 years later, marriages are standing here. He does not have a scandal. &gt;&gt; Pastor does not have a scandal. Anna doesn't have one single scand for many years. He stayed only with one woman. Today, men behind the pullpits have girlfriends in the pews in the pews. Amen. Amen. But not this man. 50 years late. One wife. I think this deserves a round of applause. I think this deserves a celebration. 50 years later, &gt;&gt; he kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Now usually you know sometime if We have had great men. Brother Biscal was a great man. When you speak about Bis, &gt;&gt; African say amen. &gt;&gt; Then when you say pastor, &gt;&gt; we are guy. Where is he going now? &gt;&gt; You are a fool. &gt;&gt; You don't see what God is doing around you. The same God that use biscuit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith. When he came to the end, &gt;&gt; when when he came to the end, he kept the faith. I looked at I looked at him relaxed on that hospital bed. There was no panic at all. Relaxed knowing where he is going. Pastor was an elder and the prophet says now the truth of the matter is the word elder. signifies who the person is. One thing that I've learned &gt;&gt; about this old man never kept a grudge. How you can keep a grudge but not this. He treated friends and enemies same way. [applause] &gt;&gt; And I think that's what we must learn. Pastors, &gt;&gt; Peter was the friend of Jesus. But Jesus says to Peter, "You David, then Judas was the enemy of Jesus." &gt;&gt; And Jesus says to him, "My friend, &gt;&gt; the art of war." [laughter] Now the truth of the matter is the word elder signifies who the person is while the word bishop signifies the office of the same man. And I was wondering you go this way. So and so calls himself apostle. This corner, this one calls himself an apostle. And I was thinking that when they speak about pastor planting a church in planting a church in Limpopo &gt;&gt; and planting the church in Switzerland. This man was an apostle but he didn't call himself an apostle but his works identify him that this man was an apostle. The elder is the man. &gt;&gt; Bishop, &gt;&gt; the elder is the man. &gt;&gt; Bishop is the office of the man. Elder and this is where people do not know. I'm going to close. Not long. There is a difference between an elder and old man in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our problem, we think some old men are elders only to find that they just old men. An elder is a man of experience. An elder is a man whose life can back up his testimony. An elder is a unifier. An elder rises above petty things. Elder &gt;&gt; always has and always will refer to a to a man's chronological age. He doesn't stop there. In the Lord, not just a coronical age. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in the Lord, So don't just be in church, but be in the Lord. He says he's an elder, &gt;&gt; not because he's elected or ordained. You don't elect an elder. Circumstances will reveal who is an elder. John when no one was worthy to take the book to lose the sins of the Lord. John says, "Then I wept." Then the Bible says, "And the elder tapped him because an elder will bring a situation under control." He said, "John, we know there is a lion of the tribe of Judah already prevailed. And we thank God for the elders. Won't be what it is without elders. &gt;&gt; And can go forward unless we've got elders. Not just old men, but elders filled with the Holy Ghost that know what pastor stood for. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, when you don't know what it cost, you're going to throw dust on this. Solomon Solom realized that oh these women are fighting for the baby and another one says this my baby and another one is dead and another one says I rather cut cut the baby in half so that I can get half then another woman say I don't want half I rather will not have the baby rather than to have her said that's the right one. Listen to me. If somebody calls into a corner, I want to split a church. You must remember that story of Solomon, a real man will say, "I want the whole church on nothing. I don't want to cut it into pieces. Even the way I preach it makes the devil uncomfortable. People say, "Why are you going there?" I'm going right there. Right there. Where you think I'm not going? I'm going right there. We want church to be united. It was united for over 50 years &gt;&gt; and it must be united another 50 years. &gt;&gt; Brother Bill, let's hear what an elder is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young men, let me share. I I've been in the message as a young boy. And when somebody wants to play politics, they always gone for the gullible young people. I was almost a victim when I was a young man. A man wanted to play vict politics. But fortunately, he fell with a woman. Then I said, you know, I don't listen to this man. Now, brother Brennham says, &gt;&gt; "An elder is more seasoned." If you ask him, "Where did you start as mommy lord?" We'll tell you, "We started here, then we then we fought that because he's seasoned. [crying] &gt;&gt; If you see I see young men, they call each other elders today. Not even one one gray hair elder babies &gt;&gt; and the elder &gt;&gt; you know pastor taught me something one time he said to me brother there is a difference between a church that is swelling and the church that is growing. And one time in weed bank I once saw our church sailing and say we need to get chess. I said we don't need chess we need antibiotics. antibiotic. &gt;&gt; There is an infection infection. But who taught me that &gt;&gt; an elder &gt;&gt; more seasoned, trained, not a novice, reliable. was reliable. He was seasoned. He was trained. He was not a novice. He was reliable. He was dependable because of his experience and longstanding proof of his Christian experience. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; How many agree that pastor was an elder and how many say he was our elder. Amen. Then Paul says now I conclude. He says henceforth &gt;&gt; there is a laid up for me a crown of righteousness. Yes, here is there is a lady for up for me a crown &gt;&gt; of righteousness. Here is a man years back boarded a train going to &gt;&gt; getting off train. getting on a bus, going all the way to Bo to preach the gospel. Here is a man drove alone, no company over 2,000 kilometers to preach the gospel. Here is a man that never robbed anyone of their money. Here is a man who the money was not his focus. His focus was the souls. Brother Brennham says &gt;&gt; in the lamb's book of life 35 is the paragraph. Brother says, "But one soul saved, you will see your name wrapped into it as long as the minister shall glitter in the sky." And I want to conclude by saying every soul into the kingdom of God's name shall be wrapped around those souls. Hallelujah. Whether they in Malawi, whether they are in a whether they inhal, whether they in Malawi, whether they in Switzerland, whether they in whether they in Botswana, whether in Congo, his name will be wrapped around those souls. And on this way, in on this way, &gt;&gt; I say go well, soldier. Well, elder, you have done your part. You have served it to the best of your ability. Amen. You have served to the best of your ability. And I say go well, but before I close, I want to do something. I want all and this may be awkward because your mom may stand up. All the babies, even if you are 45 now, all the babies that were dedicated to Pastor Israeli, I want you to stand your [applause] remain standing. Don't be ashamed. Remain remain standing. All the all the people whose marriages were officiated by pastor Israel. [applause] All right. Remain standing. Remain standing. I want those babies to remain standing as well. All of you remain standing. All the people that were touched &gt;&gt; somehow by the ministry by the life by the teachings &gt;&gt; by the influence of this elder and you're not ashamed you stand to your feet and I'm standing as well I think let's give God a hand praise [applause] God bless Thank you. [applause] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We had the right man for the job. Let's give a round of applause. &gt;&gt; I just need to take off the mic. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Just want to call &gt;&gt; pray for the word that we have heard. How many have been blessed by this? What a great &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us bow our heads and pray. Gracious heavenly father, indeed every one of us is preparing for a day like this. [snorts] Every one of us one day one by [music] one shall take the portal. Lord Jesus, if I would have to take the portal, I would like to take it the way Pastor Kimmer has done on the post of duty, [music] living a life, a living sacrifice to you, Lord. Thank you, Father, for the ministry. Thank you for the minister who was ministering to us. Father, bless him. Grant him more revelation so that when he comes back here, Father, we should always hear from the throne of God. As we are concluding this service, Lord, be with us wherever we will be. Father, let the Holy Ghost lead us. We have seen you working with us here. We have seen you keeping each and every one of us attentive to the message which has been preached. We want also to be protected on the way all the way to the grave site. Be with us as people who are crying. Be with us as people who are heavy at heart. Be with us as people who believe that there is resurrection. Help us father. There are so many of us here maybe who haven't believed this message. Let it [music] happen that the message which has been preached today should be a turning point that we should say the day [music] they were burying pastor Kodima that's the day my heart changed let it be a seed in [music] each and every unbelieving heart. We commit everything including the director of ceremonies, the drivers, the guards, the people who are helping us from the services. All of them father commit them into thine holy hands. Let your angels encamp around this place. For we hear the book saying, "Angels encamp about those who love the Lord." Let this angels be with us all over wherever we'll be going. Father, thank you Lord that you have given us men who can stand with the word. You have given us men who can be our fathers, who can given us men who can be our mentors. Thank you father. Everything we commit into thine holy hands father in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Brothers, technical team. Uh the pastor uh pastor Edgar say he gave you a video &gt;&gt; is the video already where the pastor is waving by to the church. Uh as the brothers are preparing that I need brother here &gt;&gt; to come and &gt;&gt; help us with some announcements. &gt;&gt; Okay. As uh the elder is coming the brothers can display the video for us somewhere there. He can also be closer so that he can give me a song. So the video has started not yet. Okay. We are we are waiting for you brothers. A question. Whoever has ever prayed and said, "God, I want to see you." &gt;&gt; Stand up. Let me see. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who can tell me that &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; What did he see? What he wanted to see? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, if that shall come to us before that time, [screaming] I be a natural death of this earth and separation here. May we enter chambers with a gown of faith wrapping the robe of Christ around you the Holy Ghost. Someday we got to come down. Father, I realize I got to walk that line, too. When I hear my thread, &gt;&gt; I don't want to go like a coward. &gt;&gt; I want to go like you lord. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. And he being the groom, &gt;&gt; the bride has to come forth because it's part of him. &gt;&gt; And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride. that can only manifest if it does something different from the groom. It isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones, life of his life, power of his power. &gt;&gt; She is him. As man and woman are one, the woman taken from his side. She has taken his spirit, the baby, his spirit coming, the flesh from his side. Faith both senic and dynamic. The wife, the spirit of him, and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dimension [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; She is him. What is this? Yes, it's when you are in channels into another dimension where it is victory. There's no victory. &gt;&gt; While walking around, I to me I think of seeing things for the last time. &gt;&gt; You know the people that are blessed when their [music] time is over, they know it. God bless you until we meet again.

We want to thank the family, &gt;&gt; the pastors &gt;&gt; and all that has given us support. &gt;&gt; May the Lord richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we prepare to go and lay the body of our pastor, &gt;&gt; I have few announcement. Um we have organized nine buses. So one of the buses &gt;&gt; it will accommodate elders and the pastors. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We also have other transport for [music] the pastors, &gt;&gt; especially those that slept in the guest house [music] in Mayor's Park. They will continue to use the transport that [music] was organized for. So we have brother Mad and also &gt;&gt; so we are requesting all the coordinators from different sister churches [music] to assist the believers into the passes. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It is very crucial that we do not waste time [music] and we avoid fellowship outside. When we leave the hall, we are requested [music] to go straight into the pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The pastor will guide us how we proceed to go out of the hall as it will be the pastor's first with the body of our pastor the family. But once the family and the elders and the pastors are out of the hall, then all believers can go straight to the buses. Amen. We also request young brothers and sisters, especially those that normally work with sister. [music] We request them to remain behind and not to go to the graveite. to help prepare the hall for [music] the VIPs for buying. So when we return for the great we are coming [music] back here. So all the round tables that will be in the hall are reserved for the family and the pastors [music] and their wives and all those that were given the tag as VIPs. Amen. Amen. On the left wing, we also have another place for the VIPs and we are going to use that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And [music] for all the believers, &gt;&gt; we have mobile stations. So mobile stations they can serve from the any mobile station that will be outside and they can find a place to sit inside. Amen. Now [music] let me repeat this one. &gt;&gt; The buses outside &gt;&gt; have to leave first. Then once they leave the place, &gt;&gt; no other car must leave. &gt;&gt; The buses are blocking the road for the hes. So that's why we don't want you to waste time. just get into the buses so that they can move out of the yard. So the buses will be followed by the family car and the pastor's car. Then all other cars that want to go to the graveyard will fall. But we encourage everyone to find a spot in the bus. May the Lord richly bless you. The pastors requested that that video that was showing earlier on that that they play that while we invite Pastor David to come forth. [music] May the Lord richly bless you. I have two items here. &gt;&gt; Uh, one is a radio control &gt;&gt; and there is a mobile phone that was left in the hall [music] last night with a banking card inside. So, please you can come and collect them. God bless you. Shalom sense. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; As we uh are getting to now the move to the grave site. Uh we pass our gratitude &gt;&gt; and we thank everyone. who came to support the family and the church from the first day. This sad news came to us. Uh I would love to have uh music playing there. Um the way we will do it is that uh the pastor's &gt;&gt; okay. Uh I think the services will help us to come. uh so that we start [music] uh packing our flowers. &gt;&gt; So I will have pastor Madiva &gt;&gt; Pastor [music] Edgar Edgar &gt;&gt; Pastor Maka &gt;&gt; Pastor Freddy &gt;&gt; Pastor Fredd [music] they will join me by the casket there. Then as they will be standing there. So the coffin will go first with the pastors around taking it. Then uh the family will follow the closed family. &gt;&gt; The direct family and the children and the grandchildren will be behind them. pastors are going to follow them. &gt;&gt; But uh Okay. Uh while you saying that announcement, there's no problem. You can say that quickly. Uh then uh pastor Koko will come to pray for us for the the road to the grave site. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
