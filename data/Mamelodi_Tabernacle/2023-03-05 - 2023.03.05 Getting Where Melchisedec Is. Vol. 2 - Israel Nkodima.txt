Description:
Title: Getting Where Melchisedec is II
This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 05 March 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about getting where Melchisedec is. The Pastor read Genesis 14: 17 – 20

And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

During the sermon the Pastor indicated that after God created Adam he gave him a title deed book, which was to show that he has domain over the garden of Eden. When Adam forfeited the book, God took it back, so that Satan should not see the mysteries within the book.

He also read Revelation 5: 1 - 3

And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

He further informed the church that our Names are in this book. The book was in the right hand of the majesty and came down to the right hand of the angel. When there was no man found worthy there was no jubilee, but when the worthy one was found jubilee started in heaven. Don't look around and say where will I go to worship; because when He is in you He is the place of worship.

Sinners the Lord Morena started to rewind and uh to keep his own words let us make men in our image no the first son in human race [Music] forfeited the book because after he made amen he even gave him the book the title is because he shared with him a part of Eden uh he yeah God himself was the god of Eden but he made his son the god of the Earth that's why you have Eden and the garden of Egypt is The Garden of God now he put his son is foreign all right amen now let's look at this now what was given to Adam was attacking Jesus all right amen well the title did meaning that yeah the Garden of Eden is under your control uh what you say there it shall be done what you put they shall remain what you plant there shall remain I've given you the authority the deed fulfill it together but fella foreign because that was the book of secrets the book of mysteries so when Adam dropped it yeah it was for Saturn Satan not to see the secrets between this God and this manner amen amen and then what happened later that that that title did yeah it's called them the book of redemption God knew that uh he would need that Redemption book um yeah so when Adam fulfated God took it it was not for

our destiny our destination what it says Revelation chapter 5 verse one to seven amen and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the souls thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found with to open and to read the book neither to look there on okay amen uh I saw continue I saw in the right hand in the
