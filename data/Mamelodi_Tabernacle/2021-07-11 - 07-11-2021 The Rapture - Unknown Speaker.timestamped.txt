[1:03:06] come together for
[1:03:08] to worship now let's open the scriptures
[1:03:13] as we are getting into
[1:03:17] the rapture
[1:03:19] we are not talking about the rapture
[1:03:22] we are getting into it
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:28] okay now
[1:03:30] it's god's promise
[1:03:34] he has given to his children
[1:03:37] that he will come
[1:03:40] now
[1:03:42] in the process
[1:03:44] we are going to look also into
[1:03:47] events
[1:03:51] before
[1:03:52] the rapture
[1:03:55] we have events like a and magog
[1:04:00] and
[1:04:01] the river euphrates
[1:04:04] coming from the garden of eden
[1:04:08] from eden
[1:04:10] you know it was a river
[1:04:13] and to
[1:04:15] water the garden
[1:04:18] because you have eden
[1:04:20] and the garden of eden
[1:04:23] in eden there is a garden
[1:04:27] which was the headquarters of adam
[1:04:31] because you know
[1:04:34] god is the god of the universe
[1:04:38] but he has given a little kingdom to his
[1:04:42] son
[1:04:45] and adam became the god of the earth
[1:04:50] but not the god to be worshipped
[1:04:54] he's
[1:04:55] a man
[1:04:58] like me
[1:05:00] don't try to worship me i'm a man
[1:05:05] even when it comes to healing
[1:05:08] i can't heal you
[1:05:10] but god can heal you
[1:05:13] the man who should receive the glory is
[1:05:16] the lord jesus christ
[1:05:21] not myself not any man
[1:05:24] now let's look at the subject
[1:05:28] subject
[1:05:29] by reading some scriptures
[1:05:32] and then we will stop for the next time
[1:05:35] again
[1:05:38] taking it bit by big
[1:05:40] we will end up with the battle of
[1:05:42] armageddon
[1:05:45] and which which the people that are
[1:05:48] chosen
[1:05:51] and
[1:05:52] we will show them here
[1:05:55] the people that are going to fight the
[1:05:57] battle of america

[1:06:03] some of them are here
[1:06:08] these people
[1:06:11] they
[1:06:12] come all the way
[1:06:15] from a battle in heaven
[1:06:18] and satan started the battle there
[1:06:22] and he was defeated
[1:06:25] by micah
[1:06:28] and then he was cast down to the earth
[1:06:32] then he started that he continued with
[1:06:34] the battle here on earth
[1:06:37] and it's raging on since ever
[1:06:42] now it is coming to the end
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:46] because it started in heaven
[1:06:49] then it will end up in the form of the
[1:06:51] battle of armageddon
[1:06:55] and here it is now
[1:06:58] but firstly is gorg and magog

[1:07:16] we'll come to the river euphrates
[1:07:19] because
[1:07:20] it is reflected here in the revelation
[1:07:23] chapter
[1:07:26] do you know where you free jesus
[1:07:32] oh my
[1:07:34] let us
[1:07:35] bow our heads
[1:07:38] for reading we are going back to the
[1:07:40] scriptures we have read last
[1:07:43] and
[1:07:45] we just hinted at it
[1:07:48] ok
[1:07:50] our heavenly father
[1:07:53] here we come again
[1:07:56] we woke up this morning
[1:07:59] looking around
[1:08:02] that day
[1:08:04] where is he
[1:08:09] the son of god
[1:08:14] emmanuel
[1:08:18] the king
[1:08:20] melchizedek
[1:08:23] he is all and in all
[1:08:27] and this morning
[1:08:29] he is here with us
[1:08:32] like david we shall not fear
[1:08:36] you promised and said
[1:08:39] i'll be with you
[1:08:41] till the end of the war
[1:08:45] so your word cannot lie
[1:08:48] what you have said
[1:08:50] you will also perform
[1:08:53] and bring to pass everything
[1:08:55] that you have predicted
[1:08:57] so we are glad this morning we are
[1:09:00] looking unto thee the author and the
[1:09:03] finisher
[1:09:04] of our faith to speak to us and bless
[1:09:07] your people as moses one time said
[1:09:11] these people are not my people
[1:09:14] but they are your people
[1:09:16] and even this morning they are not my
[1:09:18] people or our people but they are your
[1:09:21] people
[1:09:22] so we are glad lord to come into this
[1:09:25] house
[1:09:26] and the satan
[1:09:28] the foe
[1:09:30] who
[1:09:31] who has dented
[1:09:33] the lives of the people
[1:09:35] even to this morning is roaming about
[1:09:40] but the results of god
[1:09:42] who came from god has has overcome him
[1:09:45] before and they will continue to
[1:09:48] overcome
[1:09:51] thank you lord as we pray in jesus
[1:09:53] christ's name amen
[1:09:56] shall we read the scriptures
[1:10:00] that is
[1:10:02] first corinthians
[1:10:05] chapter 15 verse 51
[1:10:13] last week let us just continue now we
[1:10:16] are getting into it the
[1:10:29] be rapture
[1:10:30] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:10:34] and the last trump
[1:10:36] for the championship sound
[1:10:38] and the dead shall be raised
[1:10:40] incorruptible
[1:10:42] and we shall be
[1:10:47] oh
[1:10:49] the second one
[1:11:08] as others which have no hope
[1:11:11] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:11:14] rose again
[1:11:15] if you saw them also which keep in jesus
[1:11:19] will god bring with him
[1:11:22] for these we say unto you by the way of
[1:11:25] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:11:28] remain
[1:11:29] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[1:11:32] prevent them which are asleep
[1:11:34] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:11:37] heaven with a shout
[1:11:39] with the voice of the archangel and with
[1:11:42] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:11:45] shall rise first
[1:11:47] then we which are alive and remain
[1:11:50] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:11:53] the clouds
[1:11:54] to meet the lord in the air
[1:11:56] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:12:00] wherefore comfort one another with his
[1:12:03] ways
[1:12:05] you may be seated god bless you
[1:12:09] okay i'll be watching the clock there
[1:12:13] all right brother
[1:12:16] just come with me here
[1:12:18] the rapture
[1:12:22] firstly
[1:12:34] god bless you
[1:12:37] now as i am saying
[1:12:39] i think
[1:12:41] was it last week when we
[1:12:44] beam to you
[1:12:46] the photos of
[1:12:47] three
[1:13:03] do you know putin
[1:13:05] who is he
[1:13:09] all right
[1:13:10] now we'll come to
[1:13:13] predictions that we made
[1:13:29] you are so blessed if these things are
[1:13:32] in your heart
[1:13:36] and we'll come to those scriptures
[1:13:40] and it puts
[1:13:41] russia as the king of the
[1:13:44] north
[1:13:59] will show you
[1:14:00] these things
[1:14:02] right here
[1:14:04] and
[1:14:05] the bible says
[1:14:07] it is
[1:14:08] drying up for one reason
[1:14:12] and
[1:14:13] it is to open a way
[1:14:16] for the kings of east
[1:14:20] now these kings of east
[1:14:23] they are coming for the battle of
[1:14:24] armageddon
[1:14:26] for them
[1:14:39] the final battle
[1:14:42] so we'll follow them
[1:14:45] as they come
[1:14:47] now here it says
[1:14:50] and
[1:14:51] which we which
[1:14:53] we have
[1:14:54] them that are asleep
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:59] we shall not
[1:15:00] prevent them
[1:15:03] and we which are alive
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:10] now that's what the bible put it puts it
[1:15:13] like that
[1:15:15] it's addressing those that are asleep
[1:15:18] and we and we
[1:15:21] which are
[1:15:22] alive
[1:15:24] because it is one church
[1:15:27] but in different dimensions
[1:15:31] so that's why paul says
[1:15:36] where is it where is it thessalonians
[1:15:39] chapter
[1:15:42] four
[1:15:43] you listen to paul here
[1:15:48] you are saying paul is there
[1:15:56] you have
[1:15:59] you must watch the foreigners
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:04] john was a foreigner
[1:16:08] and there's a forerunner again
[1:16:12] the bible
[1:16:14] puts that for runner as elijah
[1:16:19] we will put them in line we will see
[1:16:22] them
[1:16:23] because even john
[1:16:25] the bible says
[1:16:28] he will go before the lord in the spirit
[1:16:30] of elijah
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:59] of your spirit
[1:17:14] will give you the scriptures
[1:17:16] in the spirit and the power of elijah
[1:17:20] and malacca four comes again and say
[1:17:24] behold i will send you elijah
[1:17:28] before the
[1:17:31] great and terrible day of the lord
[1:17:35] now when is that day
[1:17:38] before the terrible day is elijah again
[1:17:42] now
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:57] so now that's how god used to this
[1:17:59] spirit
[1:18:02] and
[1:18:03] we have benefited
[1:18:05] spiritually
[1:18:09] and even the
[1:18:10] elijah was there on mount
[1:18:12] transfiguration
[1:18:15] who can read it quickly for me
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:19] the mount transfiguration
[1:18:23] you find
[1:18:25] mount transfiguration
[1:18:27] where you find elijah
[1:18:30] moses elijah
[1:18:32] and christ
[1:18:35] on mount transfiguration
[1:18:37] you still have that scripture in your
[1:18:39] bibles
[1:18:40] you already can read it
[1:18:43] if you have it in your bible
[1:18:46] all right
[1:18:49] okay because you don't know you don't
[1:18:52] have it
[1:18:54] it says
[1:18:55] on one transfiguration
[1:18:59] they appear
[1:19:00] appeared
[1:19:01] moses
[1:19:04] elijah
[1:19:05] and christ
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:08] they spoke of his disease
[1:19:12] in
[1:19:12] israel
[1:19:15] he will again
[1:19:17] appear
[1:19:18] there
[1:19:20] and the bible says now we follow that
[1:19:24] we follow that
[1:19:32] you haven't found
[1:19:42] all right you know what the bible says
[1:19:45] we should not just hear the word
[1:20:17] shaking that you you don't copy from
[1:20:19] another
[1:20:21] it should be from yourself
[1:20:25] even the word of god
[1:20:27] you should not copy from somebody
[1:20:31] it should be in you
[1:20:34] didn't the lord said
[1:20:36] at that day you shall know
[1:20:39] that i am in you
[1:20:42] and you in me
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:58] the third pool that will give you
[1:21:01] rapture in faith
[1:21:03] is the pool that is within you
[1:21:08] the word of god
[1:21:10] that will give you the rapturing faith
[1:21:25] because it is divine

[1:21:31] let's start here
[1:21:33] with
[1:21:34] and we which are alive
[1:21:39] now we which are alive
[1:21:42] waiting for those
[1:21:44] that
[1:21:46] that are asleep
[1:21:49] the bible will put it to us like that
[1:21:53] we have the sixth dimension
[1:21:57] which those that are asleep
[1:22:00] are in the sixth dimension
[1:22:03] and we are here let me read to you
[1:22:07] a bit of these things
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:15] you know this is the day when the books
[1:22:17] are opened
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:22] and the one book called the book of life
[1:22:25] and we have also the lamb's book of life
[1:22:29] i'm looking for a book here before we
[1:22:31] continue
[1:22:33] but let's start here
[1:22:36] we which are alive
[1:22:39] we have indicated there
[1:22:42] that i don't know if you can see that
[1:22:47] now
[1:22:48] we have this
[1:22:49] a pyramid here
[1:23:02] you know in egypt we have pyramids
[1:23:06] even scientists
[1:23:08] they believe that it is the sign of
[1:23:10] enoch
[1:23:14] and enoch enoch
[1:23:16] the seventh man
[1:23:21] the bible says god took him away
[1:23:25] because he pleased god
[1:23:29] and you brother and sister
[1:23:31] you are living in the seventh age
[1:23:35] which you should please god and you will

[1:27:23] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:27:28] our power
[1:27:29] the dog that is your heart

[1:27:40] voice
[1:27:42] you hear the voice you will you will
[1:27:45] never come to god
[1:27:46] unless you hear his voice
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:52] we can join church
[1:27:55] amen but still failing
[1:28:03] we come from different churches
[1:28:06] trying to find god
[1:28:11] in our distress
[1:28:14] we would change churches
[1:28:17] from this one to that one
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:20] from faith mission to assemblies of god
[1:28:22] from this to that
[1:28:24] in search of something
[1:28:27] you know i'm told that god is like a
[1:28:29] diamond
[1:28:32] now
[1:28:33] with diamonds like this
[1:28:37] the diamond dickers
[1:28:41] they don't
[1:28:43] actually discover it as a diamond like
[1:28:45] that
[1:28:48] it's something dated with that it's
[1:28:50] covered with death
[1:28:53] like the same written
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:55] the bible says she was a prostitute
[1:28:58] covered with death
[1:29:00] but because she was in the book of god
[1:29:04] at the appointed time god came to heaven
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:10] until she said
[1:29:12] to the lord jesus christ i perceive you
[1:29:15] are a prophet
[1:29:17] and jesus said yes yes
[1:29:20] you know and from that time she was
[1:29:22] changed
[1:29:24] because she was predestinated
[1:29:28] to begin with she was not a prostitute
[1:29:32] but god has placed his seed in that
[1:29:35] woman
[1:29:47] god can change you even now
[1:29:52] if you open your heart to him
[1:29:56] he keeps on changing people
[1:30:00] we were all like drunkards we were
[1:30:02] drunkards
[1:30:03] we used to smoke we used to use
[1:30:07] drugs and so forth but he has changed us
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:13] not ourselves
[1:30:15] i couldn't change myself
[1:30:18] amen i couldn't be holy without him
[1:30:23] no man could can be holy
[1:30:27] but it is the holy god in amen
[1:30:32] amen so if you give your life to him
[1:30:36] he will change you
[1:30:39] amen amen don't try it yourself you
[1:30:42] can't change yourself
[1:30:44] but if you give yourself to him
[1:30:48] he will change you
[1:30:52] all right hey i'm trying
[1:30:55] to run this business here
[1:31:00] where's the scripture of mine again
[1:31:03] behold
[1:31:04] i stand at the door
[1:31:06] that is verse 20.
[1:31:11] that that's
[1:31:12] that's after
[1:31:14] he
[1:31:27] because on the day of judgment
[1:31:31] it's not you and your husband
[1:31:34] it's not you and your children
[1:31:37] it's you
[1:31:39] you'll stand there at the judgment
[1:31:42] your children will also stand at the
[1:31:44] judgment
[1:31:46] your wife will stand at the judgment
[1:31:50] industry
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:54] you yourself
[1:31:56] should find god
[1:31:58] no one can find god for somebody else
[1:32:04] he's looking at your door even now
[1:32:07] that you should open the door
[1:32:10] then he comes in
[1:32:12] if you refuse him
[1:32:15] he won't force himself into you
[1:32:19] but he is going to judge you
[1:32:41] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:32:43] logicians right
[1:32:47] this thing said the amen
[1:32:50] the faithful
[1:32:52] the true witness
[1:32:54] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:32:57] i know thy works
[1:33:00] that's verse 15 that thou art neither
[1:33:02] cold or hot
[1:33:06] i without cold or

[1:35:11] they say
[1:35:12] whether it's calabash or whatever
[1:35:16] it has to go through the fire
[1:35:20] so they put it it comes through the oven
[1:35:25] and
[1:35:26] then
[1:35:27] now on the other side of the oven
[1:35:30] is it those who came through the oven
[1:35:35] now when we arrived there
[1:35:37] there was a lady there
[1:35:40] and we were looking at those who were
[1:35:42] supposed to go through the oven
[1:35:46] they were still on this side of the oven
[1:35:49] now we were saying yeah you are nice man
[1:35:51] nice
[1:35:52] how much is it mama
[1:35:54] and she said no no no no
[1:35:57] these ones
[1:35:58] have we not yet gone through the oven
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:04] you
[1:36:05] can't be sure of the quality
[1:36:08] they must go through the fire
[1:36:12] just like the children of god
[1:36:15] the bible is easy
[1:36:17] god takes them through the fire
[1:36:21] for
[1:36:22] equality so we said in our word mama
[1:36:27] she led us to the other side of them
[1:36:31] and then she pointed to us
[1:36:34] those that came through the oven
[1:36:37] and they said to us
[1:36:39] if you want to buy
[1:36:41] you will buy from these ones
[1:36:44] not from these ones
[1:36:46] amen it goes according to the quality
[1:36:50] amen the children of god are equality
[1:36:54] they don't steal
[1:36:56] they don't swear
[1:36:58] they can kill
[1:37:00] they don't be rich
[1:37:04] they are not witches
[1:37:06] they are sons and daughters of god
[1:37:10] why
[1:37:11] they came through the fire of god
[1:37:14] and they become equality
[1:37:18] a christian true christian
[1:37:20] is equality
[1:37:24] hallelujah
[1:37:26] hey brother
[1:37:27] a true christian
[1:37:29] is a quality
[1:37:31] a high quality
[1:37:35] because
[1:37:36] he is just like his creator
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:40] for god said
[1:37:42] let us make many in our image
[1:37:46] now i'm told that
[1:37:48] the diamond
[1:37:51] if they achieve the diamonds
[1:37:54] they will never declare the diamond to
[1:37:56] be diamond
[1:37:59] until they see their reflections in that
[1:38:01] direction
[1:38:03] oh glory to god
[1:38:06] god will never call you his son
[1:38:10] until he sees himself in you
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:17] you should be a diamond
[1:38:20] that god would come and see himself
[1:38:24] that's when he will save my son my
[1:38:26] daughter
[1:38:29] and you can't say god to be your god
[1:38:33] until you see yourself in that diamond
[1:38:37] you see yourself in god
[1:38:39] before you can say i'm a child of god
[1:38:53] you are blind you are miserable
[1:38:56] that is their logician agent
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:00] this is the age that we are living in
[1:39:05] people but want the riches
[1:39:10] until they kill people
[1:39:13] in order to make a sacrifice
[1:39:17] for riches
[1:39:19] they kill babies
[1:39:22] in order to make a sacrifice
[1:39:36] where are you going
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] don't you fear god
[1:39:45] okay amen killing children
[1:39:48] just for money
[1:39:54] i'm told that
[1:39:56] all this shall pass away
[1:40:02] do you know that piece
[1:40:04] of a song of mine
[1:40:09] where will you be
[1:40:12] a hundred
[1:40:14] years from now
[1:40:17] will you be
[1:40:18] happy
[1:40:20] will you be safe
[1:40:25] i heard some young people singing
[1:40:29] thinking
[1:40:33] where are you
[1:40:36] they sing it like this
[1:40:39] where
[1:40:40] are you
[1:40:42] okay
[1:40:43] let me i'll end up singing instead of
[1:40:46] preaching they say
[1:40:48] where are you people
[1:40:51] who crucified the lord
[1:40:56] come and see progress
[1:40:59] in the work of the lord
[1:41:13] thinking that you would stop
[1:41:14] christianity
[1:41:29] in the work of the lord whom you
[1:41:31] crucified
[1:41:34] he came up on the third day
[1:41:38] and he said to john
[1:41:41] i was dead
[1:41:43] but am now alive forevermore
[1:41:47] and have the keys
[1:41:50] i'll read it to you here
[1:41:53] that he went and took the keys from
[1:41:55] satan
[1:41:57] he gave the king the key of the kingdom
[1:42:00] to
[1:42:01] peter
[1:42:04] and said
[1:42:07] peter
[1:42:08] i will give you the keys
[1:42:11] of the kingdom
[1:42:13] but there were still some keys
[1:42:16] which ones
[1:42:20] all right you don't know don't worry
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:26] as long as i know
[1:42:35] because he says verse 19 as many as i
[1:42:38] love i rebuke and chase them
[1:42:42] therefore
[1:42:43] and repent
[1:42:47] amen
[1:42:52] are you devil worshippers
[1:43:10] therefore
[1:43:11] and
[1:43:12] repent
[1:43:16] you repent today the rapture is here
[1:43:19] now then he says
[1:43:23] leaving
[1:43:24] that church with that condition
[1:43:28] where they say we are rich
[1:43:30] we are in need of nothing
[1:43:33] he left them
[1:43:35] and now he said now behold i stand at
[1:43:37] the door
[1:43:41] if god comes to you
[1:43:43] you reject him
[1:43:45] he goes to another door
[1:43:55] if any man hear my voice
[1:43:58] and open the door
[1:44:01] you don't just hear the voice
[1:44:04] you open the door i will come in to
[1:44:08] him
[1:44:12] now you see the door is the heart
[1:44:16] now he wants you to open it
[1:44:20] then he says i will come into him
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:27] god will never force himself into
[1:44:30] anybody
[1:44:32] because he knows that if you are
[1:44:34] predestinated
[1:44:37] you are just going to open up
[1:44:42] because you know him
[1:44:44] i will come into him
[1:44:47] and will stop with him
[1:44:50] you know
[1:44:51] that is the evening meal
[1:44:53] and he with me
[1:44:56] to him that overcometh
[1:44:59] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:45:07] that is in his kingdom
[1:45:12] his dominion
[1:45:15] he is inviting you to come and sit with
[1:45:17] him
[1:45:20] in his dominion
[1:45:22] then he says
[1:45:25] and
[1:45:26] it's like also overcame
[1:45:29] and and sat down with my father
[1:45:33] in his throne
[1:45:35] he that has an ear
[1:45:38] let him hear what the spirit says unto
[1:45:40] the churches
[1:45:43] now in this
[1:45:45] that is
[1:45:46] uh who are they
[1:45:49] and we which are alive
[1:45:52] we are waiting for
[1:45:54] them that are asleep
[1:46:01] yes because they are part of us
[1:46:07] and the bible says
[1:46:09] they sleep in jesus
[1:46:15] that's why they will return with him
[1:46:19] amen amen
[1:46:22] i shall not forget to say
[1:46:38] because lazarus is not that body
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:44] you are promising your name
[1:46:47] now this body
[1:46:49] is not yours
[1:46:52] you are
[1:47:04] the bible says
[1:47:06] god
[1:47:20] like
[1:47:24] he wanted this robot to move and that's
[1:47:27] why they are trying to make some robots
[1:47:29] here
[1:47:33] and put signs in those robots
[1:47:36] you see this animated things that are
[1:47:39] killing our children
[1:47:43] yeah animation and so forth
[1:47:45] now our people are trying to take it
[1:47:48] from god
[1:47:50] because adam
[1:47:52] was made of the dust
[1:47:55] amen
[1:47:56] and when he was just a robot
[1:48:00] god came
[1:48:01] then
[1:48:04] the breath of life
[1:48:06] into him
[1:48:07] and he started to say hallelujah amen
[1:48:12] amen
[1:48:13] okay
[1:48:15] now brothers
[1:48:17] he that
[1:48:18] has an ear
[1:48:21] now

[1:48:26] have one here
[1:48:29] would you marry yourself let him hear
[1:48:33] what the spirit
[1:48:35] saith unto the
[1:48:37] churches
[1:48:39] he that
[1:48:40] to him that over
[1:48:43] now in each of these ages
[1:48:48] we have the scriptures on the side there
[1:48:53] pointing
[1:48:54] to the overcomers of each age
[1:49:03] we won't read it today
[1:49:05] but you read it
[1:49:07] he doesn't overcome it he doesn't
[1:49:09] overcome it he doesn't overcome it
[1:49:11] amen
[1:49:13] because the army of god
[1:49:16] is made of overcomers
[1:49:20] no not churchgoers
[1:49:23] amen amen
[1:49:25] now
[1:49:26] as we are looking there
[1:49:29] uh
[1:49:30] you know
[1:49:30] i have a book blasphemous names i don't
[1:49:34] know if i've got it here
[1:49:36] but it's telling you all the same thing
[1:49:40] he is telling me of the same thing here
[1:49:43] it shows you that
[1:49:46] church ages
[1:49:48] constitute and make the bride
[1:49:54] some of that
[1:49:56] some out of that
[1:50:00] age
[1:50:02] some of that
[1:50:03] out of that age
[1:50:04] some of that age
[1:50:07] you know throughout the history
[1:50:11] has been coming up
[1:50:14] in a
[1:50:15] pyramid form
[1:50:18] you will see will bring
[1:50:21] a copy that shows that jerusalem is like
[1:50:24] a pyramid
[1:50:29] that's why we have it the church in the
[1:50:31] form of a pyramid
[1:50:36] now the pyramid
[1:50:38] or for
[1:50:42] enoch
[1:50:43] a sign in egypt
[1:50:47] i will come i will show you i will read
[1:50:49] it out of the bouquet
[1:50:54] that even the scientists
[1:50:58] they say
[1:51:00] today they can never never
[1:51:04] build something of that nature
[1:51:09] because
[1:51:10] and they say but the man responsible for
[1:51:14] that structure
[1:51:17] the measurements
[1:51:28] it is not from here
[1:51:30] that's why scientists cannot build a
[1:51:33] pyramid
[1:51:36] and the dimensions are in the pyramid
[1:51:40] until
[1:51:41] to where they say is the king's chamber
[1:51:46] and then when the prophet arrived
[1:51:49] and he saw that this pyramid
[1:51:52] it's a type of the church of god
[1:51:56] which is coming from ephesus in the book
[1:51:59] of revelation
[1:52:09] whom the lord has been
[1:52:11] taking out or putting aside
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:20] you know
[1:52:22] i will read it in the
[1:52:23] uh

[1:52:32] there is a battle coming
[1:52:35] called the battle of armageddon
[1:52:39] it is here in the bible
[1:52:42] but after this we are going to follow
[1:52:44] down the better
[1:52:47] until the end because
[1:52:49] we are going to revelation chapter 20
[1:52:53] where it will show us all these things
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:09] no
[1:53:10] he said i will show you
[1:53:13] [Music]
[1:53:14] god spoke of abraham
[1:53:17] and he said shall i hide from abraham
[1:53:19] the thing that i do
[1:53:21] [Music]

[1:53:49] at this five seven stages
[1:53:55] the bible says no man has seen god at
[1:53:57] any time
[1:54:00] because this pyramid speaks of time
[1:54:06] amen amen
[1:54:13] [Music]

[1:54:24] i went westward
[1:54:27] to connect with the angel's message

[2:34:30] all parents and and all chains in this
[2:34:33] place may we all leave this place free
[2:34:36] blessed father because indeed there is
[2:34:39] freedom in this place there's a great
[2:34:41] jubilee going forth in this praise
[2:34:43] heavenly father you have given us this
[2:34:46] freedom of god and we thank you and i
[2:34:48] appreciate you so much blessed father
[2:34:51] lord indeed we can see
[2:34:53] that even
[2:34:54] the prophet of god says the darkness
[2:34:57] that we are seeing seeing
[2:34:59] lord god is ushering in the coming of

[2:35:04] blessed father the most assured we are
[2:35:08] that the god is sunning very soon

[2:35:13] that the darkest part of night is just
[2:35:16] before dawn of god and father we know
[2:35:18] that all that will be breaking forth a
[2:35:21] great dawn soon and very soon when we

[2:35:56] one of us father
[2:35:58] keep these things in our hearts
[2:36:00] i'm always reminded of a scripture that
[2:36:02] says
[2:36:03] mary pondered these things in your heart
[2:36:06] father when we ponder these things when
[2:36:08] we keep these things in our hearts
[2:36:10] that's what created a body on the inside

[2:36:17] and said be it unto me according to your
[2:36:19] way
[2:36:20] and father your seven years peace this
[2:36:22] morning your weight has been preached

[2:36:28] us according to your weight oh god and
[2:36:30] may we keep this word in our hearts
[2:36:32] because there is a body that is forming
[2:36:34] on the inside
[2:36:35] that spiritual body that will break
[2:36:37] one of these days
