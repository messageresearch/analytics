[1:58:16] if
[1:58:22] I send my word
[1:58:27] of course of course it shall return unto
[1:58:30] me but not void
[1:58:34] God says
[1:58:38] if I the Lord God sent my word
[1:58:43] shall not return unto me void
[1:58:48] because that word must manifest
[1:58:56] that's why the subjects are singing
[1:59:03] amen amen

[2:00:30] foundation of the world
[2:00:34] we were in him come away
[2:00:37] okay amen

[2:00:56] let's take it from John chapter
[2:01:01] 14 verse 20 to 23.
[2:01:05] Johanna 14 verse 22-23 then we'll end up
[2:01:09] reading Revelation chapter

[2:01:37] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[2:01:40] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[2:01:44] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[2:01:46] and I will love him and will manifest
[2:01:49] myself to him
[2:01:52] Jude does not Iscariot said Judah said
[2:01:57] unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it
[2:02:01] that thou will manifest thyself unto us
[2:02:04] and not unto the world
[2:02:06] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[2:02:09] man love me he will keep my weights and
[2:02:13] my father will love him and we will come
[2:02:16] unto him and make our Abode with him
[2:02:28] Revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[2:02:32] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[2:02:35] there was silence in heaven about a
[2:02:38] space of half an hour
[2:02:42] God bless you
[2:02:45] okay
[2:02:47] all right
[2:02:52] shall we
[2:02:54] ask
[2:02:56] our pasta yeah
[2:02:59] from Zambia Zambia

[2:03:32] we shall live in a better time Lord that
[2:03:35] indeed we are ready for you to come amen
[2:03:38] even this our Lord we dedicate it in
[2:03:40] your hands as we commit your money
[2:03:42] servant that you put him aside using
[2:03:45] fathers Universal to speak through and
[2:03:48] to your children father we believe that
[2:03:51] you are here and you are going to speak
[2:03:52] and we are ready further to receive from
[2:03:54] thee and you o God start with us and
[2:03:58] with us in the precious name of Jesus
[2:04:00] father we do pray amen amen amen God
[2:04:06] bless you sir
[2:04:11] okay amen so
[2:04:18] let's take this subject I return the
[2:04:22] floor say
[2:04:25] a three-fold revelation of God
[2:04:32] I mean foreign
[2:04:42] we come with inspiration after the
[2:04:47] pastors preached today
[2:04:53] is it too impossible to have all these
[2:04:56] pastors
[2:05:08] if all of them could come in
[2:05:13] give us the word of God
[2:05:17] I believe one day
[2:05:19] it will be possible
[2:05:23] we'll sit down and count some days amen
[2:05:31] well I'll greet you after this
[2:05:35] um
[2:05:38] you know I was looking at something here
[2:05:44] we are here in the days of the
[2:05:47] manifestation
[2:05:51] and
[2:05:58] this is this
[2:06:02] is how sometimes I start I start with a
[2:06:05] very long yeah
[2:06:12] but it's not
[2:06:15] diesel I said this is
[2:06:20] and he said Ari I am the voice
[2:06:25] of the one crying in the wilderness okay
[2:06:29] that's how Jonah dressed
[2:06:31] the people there
[2:06:34] what do you say of yourself
[2:06:38] I Am The Voice
[2:06:41] Isaiah 40 okay Josiah
[2:06:46] the voice in the wilderness
[2:06:50] John knew himself to be that scripture
[2:06:57] I mean and he was that manifestation
[2:07:08] I am that scripture foreign
[2:07:15] amen
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:26] in the beginning was the word
[2:07:29] and the Word was with God
[2:07:32] and the Word was God
[2:07:36] the word was with God's meaning
[2:07:39] the word was the mind of God
[2:07:45] and the Word was God
[2:07:49] and the Word was made flesh
[2:07:54] amen that is manifestation
[2:07:57] and dwell Among Us when Jesus was
[2:08:02] working the streets of Jerusalem
[2:08:30] okay I mean
[2:08:33] he is not a change
[2:08:36] and so
[2:08:38] I
[2:08:40] you will see the difference why
[2:08:46] you know the Bible speaks of the bride
[2:08:49] of Christ
[2:08:52] learn the praise of Christ
[2:08:57] the bride of Christ
[2:09:00] is not in pieces
[2:09:05] you can't have the blood of Christ there
[2:09:07] the bride of Christ there the bride of
[2:09:09] Christ
[2:09:12] one bride of Christ denying a part of
[2:09:16] the word
[2:09:19] another bride saying the seals are not
[2:09:23] revealed
[2:09:28] can that be the bride
[2:09:32] no
[2:09:34] the bride when you're if God brings his
[2:09:39] weight is
[2:09:42] just like a husband
[2:09:44] married husband
[2:09:47] amen when he brings his word
[2:09:51] there must be
[2:09:54] the place of that word
[2:09:59] you know you should be
[2:10:02] a place amen
[2:10:07] because he said to those
[2:10:11] men around him will harasses and so
[2:10:14] forth
[2:10:17] he said
[2:10:19] my word
[2:10:21] has got no place in you
[2:10:27] because the weight must find a place
[2:10:31] when the wait finds a place
[2:10:34] and it is manifested in that place
[2:10:40] amen amen amen
[2:10:42] so
[2:10:45] like now I'm reading out of the spoken
[2:10:48] word
[2:10:49] spoken with you
[2:10:53] we said the Bible says we believe I will
[2:10:57] send to Elijah the prophet
[2:11:00] he shall tend the hearts of the people
[2:11:04] of the children thank to their fathers
[2:11:11] and policies polar about the God
[2:11:15] he says he is the god whom I worship
[2:11:19] from my forefathers amen
[2:11:26] not because somebody testified to me
[2:11:30] no it is from my forefathers
[2:11:36] it comes through
[2:11:38] a supernatural lineage
[2:11:44] walking I mean now before we start
[2:11:48] reading here
[2:11:50] I want to quote to you something here
[2:11:56] oh behold I'll send you Elijah the
[2:11:59] prophet
[2:12:00] now let us specify
[2:12:05] I
[2:12:06] I don't believe any Prophet I believe
[2:12:08] Jesus
[2:12:13] foreign amen amen
[2:12:18] but
[2:12:21] because it says listen
[2:12:25] I will send unto you
[2:12:31] let's specify
[2:12:33] it's not to everybody prophet
[2:12:42] now to whom it is
[2:12:46] to a place
[2:12:51] then you'll hear from that place saying
[2:12:55] literally the Lord has sent Elijah the
[2:12:59] prophet Morena
[2:13:02] there was a legend
[2:13:06] let's follow them and Elijah
[2:13:12] and there was Elijah the spirit of
[2:13:16] Elijah
[2:13:17] came to
[2:13:20] Elisha
[2:13:22] Then There Was the Same Spirit
[2:13:25] that came to John the Baptist
[2:13:28] they shall go before the Lord
[2:13:45] and for the last days
[2:13:48] also so it says now you would I will
[2:13:51] send unto you
[2:13:55] but if he is not sent to you you will
[2:13:58] never see and believe it
[2:14:02] because you only believe the one that is
[2:14:05] sent unto you
[2:14:08] because you are not believing a man you
[2:14:13] are believing in the world
[2:14:16] unto you
[2:14:18] that word should be picked in the body
[2:14:25] in their body
[2:14:29] will receive the message
[2:14:38] that's how it works
[2:14:42] don't argue with somebody saying I don't
[2:14:44] believe any Prophet I believe only this
[2:14:46] is
[2:14:48] sent unto you
[2:14:51] not him
[2:14:55] so now we are invited in him remember
[2:14:59] the unveiling of God
[2:15:02] this is
[2:15:06] all that he is
[2:15:10] because God wants us
[2:15:18] let us make men
[2:15:23] right amen
[2:15:26] hey let us make men
[2:15:30] have you checked yourself whether you
[2:15:33] are in His image
[2:15:37] or you are just a judge a church
[2:15:40] a believer of anything or foreign
[2:15:47] that's not manifestation
[2:15:50] manifestation is not to choose the word
[2:15:57] you can't choose the weight from the
[2:15:59] word of God
[2:16:02] it should be the way it is
[2:16:09] okay amen
[2:16:11] that's why when I worship I'm worshiping
[2:16:15] him
[2:16:18] until a brother asked me
[2:16:21] he said
[2:16:23] I you know
[2:16:25] you have lost weight I
[2:16:29] said yeah it is because
[2:16:32] I want to take the shape of my
[2:16:36] foreign
[2:16:50] okay
[2:16:54] I'm not saying I'm I'm starting to gain
[2:16:58] again I think
[2:17:00] all right
[2:17:03] so now we are invited into him remember
[2:17:07] to be pop take us off all that he is
[2:17:14] we are invited into him remember which
[2:17:18] is heat to unbelievers
[2:17:22] by the veil of human flesh
[2:17:38] it's
[2:17:44] a manifest
[2:17:48] you know Amen to somebody is just the
[2:17:51] way forward I preach the word of God
[2:17:54] that's good
[2:17:56] but let it be a manifestation
[2:18:00] God has spoken already
[2:18:03] it is no more a word it's a reality
[2:18:11] God said let there be light
[2:18:14] that was the way
[2:18:16] but now it actually there is light
[2:18:20] theater foreign
[2:18:48] you've never got repeating that again
[2:18:59] and you can't be if I see you hey Google
[2:19:03] talking to a man uh
[2:19:07] whom you class as a Christian
[2:19:11] but saying to him
[2:19:14] you must love love your brother
[2:19:18] foreign
[2:20:05] I don't laugh because the word says love
[2:20:09] now I love because love is in me
[2:20:14] now you don't have to repeat it to me
[2:20:20] because it is being manifested
[2:20:23] you are looking at me the manifestation
[2:20:27] of that word
[2:20:31] now we will start here now
[2:20:34] now we are
[2:20:37] and
[2:20:40] that was the wait but now
[2:20:43] there is light see it is all
[2:20:46] it is in the weight it is
[2:20:54] let's take Revelation and follow this
[2:20:56] now
[2:21:00] Revelation chapter 8.
[2:21:06] when he opened the
[2:21:09] seventh
[2:21:10] say brother when you open the seventh
[2:21:14] sin the seventh thing
[2:21:20] and it said nothing yeah
[2:21:29] now I look for it even
[2:21:32] some few days ago
[2:21:38] there is a I remember when I was in Cape
[2:21:41] Town
[2:21:43] I was told by a brother
[2:21:48] after we greeted a brother we let
[2:21:52] on the street Brothers
[2:21:56] he said
[2:21:58] well it was not a gossip once I say he
[2:22:01] just said you see that brother foreign
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:24] about the space of half an hour
[2:22:29] don't try it in their Church
[2:22:39] say but what do you want to say
[2:22:42] because it says when you open the seal
[2:22:48] silence what do you want to say
[2:22:55] amen
[2:23:02] if invited there I would know what to do
[2:23:05] now
[2:23:10] comes in this manner
[2:23:15] because
[2:23:17] whether it is silence in heaven
[2:23:21] it still has to be
[2:23:25] manifested
[2:23:29] amen
[2:23:31] amen because it's the wind that went
[2:23:34] forth already
[2:23:37] okay and when he opened it is not closed
[2:23:40] opened
[2:23:43] I mean
[2:23:45] well okay amen
[2:23:48] I can talk to my brother here
[2:23:53] verbally
[2:23:55] you'll be listening to me
[2:23:58] but the word that I'm going to keep to
[2:24:01] myself
[2:24:04] maybe saying this one I'll tell him one
[2:24:07] day
[2:24:11] he won't hear me
[2:24:14] he said something reserved
[2:24:18] me
[2:24:19] I will tell him this is
[2:24:28] now once it is
[2:24:32] then it is
[2:24:36] but it was kept
[2:24:39] until
[2:24:40] that day in April is
[2:24:46] I believe it will answer it will give us
[2:24:49] the answer
[2:24:52] because the all the peoples through the
[2:24:54] generations they come
[2:24:56] back he opened
[2:24:59] the server when the seventh was opened
[2:25:02] silence then they go back oh I know
[2:25:07] thinking that there's nothing but
[2:25:11] it is opened apron amen
[2:25:15] the thing is open but they don't see
[2:25:18] what is that oh
[2:25:23] you know the prophet mu profita about
[2:25:27] the the pyramid
[2:25:31] he said to the people look inside
[2:25:35] the pyramid camera pyramid and what was
[2:25:39] inside
[2:25:43] with no writing money
[2:25:46] the people look inside
[2:25:48] but they couldn't see anything
[2:25:53] nothing was written
[2:25:57] then it says then they started walking
[2:26:00] away
[2:26:15] when he returned only few he found only
[2:26:19] few still looking amen
[2:26:27] then I said to you
[2:26:31] there's a type that I know
[2:26:36] and of some doubts that I saw
[2:26:41] working along
[2:26:43] the uh it was what you call these things
[2:26:48] of the
[2:26:49] water display of something I don't know
[2:26:53] what do you call them
[2:26:55] Fountain maybe yes
[2:26:59] and it is
[2:27:07] Seated on that wall or what you call it
[2:27:12] I'm looking inside
[2:27:15] and inside is
[2:27:18] water amazing now they could see their
[2:27:22] images in the water
[2:27:24] come on
[2:27:26] now I was with my brother-in-law
[2:27:30] then I said do you see my brother what's
[2:27:33] happening
[2:27:34] because they were working around after
[2:27:36] three
[2:27:38] they chose to be three
[2:27:41] so they were working around the dike
[2:27:43] like this
[2:27:45] but looking inside like this
[2:27:49] so I said to my brother I want to see
[2:27:52] what's happening
[2:28:00] they just flew away we Disturbed them
[2:28:04] okay
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:19] this dance they saw themselves in there
[2:28:24] and those who remained
[2:28:27] they saw themselves
[2:28:29] in there because that white stone
[2:28:33] there was no writing on it
[2:28:38] a real writing one side of them
[2:28:44] they couldn't leave their place
[2:28:53] that's why we are yeah
[2:28:56] people come and go but we will remain
[2:28:59] because we have seen ourselves
[2:29:03] that's the difference
[2:29:05] the one who has seen himself you will
[2:29:09] never leave that place
[2:29:12] if the Jesus you worship you have seen
[2:29:16] yourself in him
[2:29:17] never quit
[2:29:20] I mean if the Gospel wherever he
[2:29:23] followed yourself
[2:29:26] you will never leave that gospel
[2:29:32] because your image
[2:29:36] let us make men
[2:29:39] amen
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:22] I mean I mean
[2:30:24] Adam also in you because being a mirror
[2:30:27] release
[2:30:32] after he has lost
[2:30:35] their reflection
[2:30:42] but the merciful god
[2:30:45] okay
[2:30:49] I can't see myself
[2:30:57] amen because he could see himself
[2:31:03] and it was for Adam to see himself in
[2:31:07] him
[2:31:11] where have you been worshiping
[2:31:14] have you ever seen yourself now how far
[2:31:17] we born that's why you left
[2:31:24] that's why the Lord cannot leave you
[2:31:27] Morena
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:31] because you are his image amen
[2:31:40] okay I mean
[2:31:43] oh no usually
[2:31:46] I'm
[2:31:48] taking this now yeah
[2:31:52] many people believe that
[2:31:57] although I'm not talking about the
[2:31:59] people
[2:32:01] and I won't say anything wrong about
[2:32:03] some other people
[2:32:07] I read you know
[2:32:10] the Bible says it was
[2:32:13] silent
[2:32:18] what about the Earth
[2:32:23] I mean
[2:32:25] amen you know if somebody say to me
[2:32:28] you know in heaven
[2:32:32] is
[2:32:34] I'll say Yeah well yeah you can hear the
[2:32:38] noise around here we are here
[2:32:43] all right
[2:32:45] you wouldn't mind about it
[2:32:48] in heaven it's not here on Earth
[2:32:53] while it was in heaven
[2:32:59] and it was all quiet
[2:33:04] on Earth
[2:33:08] what was happening
[2:33:11] because on Earth there was an
[2:33:14] announcements
[2:33:17] about that
[2:33:22] do you know
[2:33:24] Adam that's about Adam
[2:33:26] on Earth
[2:33:29] when God
[2:33:31] will demold the things
[2:33:35] that's how creation came about and
[2:33:38] things you know
[2:33:45] create something
[2:33:48] bring it over to
[2:33:50] Adam
[2:33:51] Adam
[2:33:54] for Adam
[2:33:57] to say
[2:34:00] what would Adam saying
[2:34:04] right amen it didn't come with a text
[2:34:09] telling Adam that thing is
[2:34:18] Adam after Adam the Bible says Adam
[2:34:22] would call Adam by name amen
[2:34:29] because Adam coward Adam was the other
[2:34:32] part of the contract
[2:34:37] God would send something to Adam Adam
[2:34:40] had only already that answer Adam
[2:34:45] because Adam was the god of the
[2:34:49] Earth
[2:34:52] and God been the god of
[2:34:54] the universe
[2:34:56] now that's why we have Eden
[2:35:00] and the garden
[2:35:03] was the headquarters of God
[2:35:07] and the Garden of Eden the headquarters
[2:35:10] of his son
[2:35:15] what happened
[2:35:17] Adam would knew anything
[2:35:19] proceeding from God
[2:35:23] it is how
[2:35:28] it was
[2:35:30] if at that time perhaps you are in
[2:35:33] heaven
[2:35:34] and you see God molding something uh
[2:35:41] well God where God where God moved the
[2:35:44] things
[2:35:47] if you happen to be there
[2:35:50] it will come from there without the name
[2:35:56] because there's another partner of the
[2:35:58] contract
[2:36:02] that's right for for the word of God God
[2:36:06] sends some prophets
[2:36:08] a prophet is a past partner
[2:36:14] amen amen
[2:36:16] he is the other part of the contract
[2:36:18] with God
[2:36:21] God will do this and live another part
[2:36:25] for the men
[2:36:27] we all know that right
[2:36:32] I can give you one again
[2:36:37] Blended so we'll have foreign
[2:37:02] [Music]
[2:37:05] so God sent him to the part of the
[2:37:08] contract
[2:37:11] prayed for him and so forth
[2:37:15] okay amen
[2:37:18] do you want another one
[2:37:23] Philly Philip was on his way
[2:37:27] was somewhere else but there was a man
[2:37:31] from Jerusalem
[2:37:37] that man prayed and prayed to God
[2:37:40] and then he was reading the book of
[2:37:43] Isaiah
[2:37:44] couldn't understand it so he prayed
[2:37:50] then what happened
[2:37:53] state of God giving the direct answer
[2:38:01] because God has a partner he comes in a
[2:38:05] contract
[2:38:07] man is God's partner
[2:38:13] saw Philip King philippiac that man
[2:38:16] could have said hey I prayed to God not
[2:38:19] you know
[2:38:22] amen
[2:38:24] ugly people what about a partner the
[2:38:27] pattern of God comes
[2:38:36] you can hear men who God
[2:38:39] is
[2:38:41] a man sent from God Amen
[2:39:07] [Music]
[2:39:20] that means he is part of the way
[2:40:23] you don't see him amen
[2:40:36] amen
[2:40:38] that's it I mean
[2:40:43] there is a part of God
[2:40:45] that he has sent in the end time
[2:40:50] okay I mean that's why
[2:40:53] silent in Heavens
[2:40:59] now we look into the Bible and realize
[2:41:03] that
[2:41:04] they were things
[2:41:07] in heaven Lord
[2:41:10] the Angels were familiar with things
[2:41:13] in heaven
[2:41:15] but we are going to read after global
[2:41:18] how the Angels come over so those things
[2:41:23] now being sent down
[2:41:28] by him
[2:41:33] no while you are wondering we are going
[2:41:36] to read here
[2:41:40] it says
[2:41:41] the angels in heaven
[2:41:44] stopped by by Amisha I mean there was a
[2:41:48] scenery of some kind
[2:41:52] that caused the angels to stop says
[2:41:56] things were not ordinary anymore
[2:41:59] because they were looking at things
[2:42:03] being sent down
[2:42:10] now
[2:42:12] it was silent in heaven
[2:42:17] what was happening you're going to find
[2:42:20] in the Bible because the people rejoice
[2:42:25] when Heaven stopped amen
[2:42:31] [Applause]
[2:42:33] amen when things
[2:42:36] came down
[2:42:39] let me read one scripture you'll hear
[2:42:42] that

[3:03:37] it says of the Seed of Abraham
[3:03:42] that this Seed of Abraham
[3:03:46] say it the Seed of Abraham amen is
[3:03:49] Christ amen
[3:03:52] Galatians chapter 3
[3:03:56] verse 16 yes now to Abraham and his seat
[3:04:01] where the promise is made he saith not
[3:04:05] and to his to seeds as of many but as of

[3:24:04] what takes place at that time
[3:24:11] it will be
[3:24:14] revered look out
[3:24:16] it was opened
[3:24:19] says it will be revealed because
[3:24:24] it was revealed
[3:24:26] him
[3:24:31] all right but to the rest
[3:24:38] you see a foreign
[3:24:59] like John was a foreign
[3:25:28] that take
[3:25:30] away the sin of the world that's a
[3:25:35] forerunner
[3:25:37] telling them he has come forward
[3:25:45] I mean I mean no
[3:25:48] yes they last foreign
[3:26:30] [Music]
[3:26:48] so
[3:27:34] do you know that yeah that's why the
[3:27:37] Bible says the sea shall be no more
[3:27:40] inhabitants
[3:27:50] who inhibits the city
[3:27:54] do you know that yeah
[3:28:01] the prophet calls it under
[3:28:05] um
[3:28:07] we can read about them in the Bible
[3:28:12] even the creatures of the deep
[3:28:16] speaks of that but because
[3:28:20] [Music]
[3:28:22] the devil operated Saturn over over
[3:28:25] America and Jesus died
[3:28:28] but the Bible says we believe when he
[3:28:31] died
[3:28:31] when he went away with a guy to hell
[3:28:38] because
[3:28:50] one key he gave to Peter the key of the
[3:28:53] Kingdom said
[3:28:58] Peter Pedro because Peter answered
[3:29:07] the Living God
[3:29:10] my father has revealed this
[3:29:13] I will give you the key
[3:29:17] you have opened up
[3:29:20] now here's the key yeah right
[3:29:25] did you see that but there were some
[3:29:28] other Keys
[3:29:30] the key of
[3:29:31] Kia
[3:29:34] hell and hedges amen
[3:29:38] so Revelation chapter one Jesus came
[3:29:42] back with those keys
[3:29:44] when he died all right he went to the
[3:29:47] atomos we level to go his soul the body
[3:29:50] went to the Grave
[3:29:52] the body me but the soul if the soul
[3:29:56] went down to the atoms yeah and took the
[3:29:59] keys
[3:30:00] because
[3:30:02] Lucifer Lucifer lived there but
[3:30:09] hell was not burning
[3:30:13] I mean it says hell is
[3:30:23] that is the headquarters of Lucifer
[3:30:27] Lucifer he was the Bible says the Lord
[3:30:31] Jesus went to hell
[3:30:34] itself
[3:30:36] took the keys very key
[3:30:40] somebody was preaching saying
[3:30:42] Jesus survived the fire of hell when he
[3:30:45] went there
[3:30:51] you should hear them silent angel
[3:30:53] messages
[3:30:56] but he came back with the keys and when
[3:31:00] John saw him he fell down
[3:31:07] fear not it's a boy I am he that was
[3:31:10] dead
[3:31:12] now I am alive
[3:31:15] and have the keys
[3:31:23] all right Amen on the day of judgment I
[3:31:28] will open up and they help me catch fire
[3:31:34] all right
[3:31:37] you know you think that Satan was in a
[3:31:40] in some flames of fire in there
[3:31:46] the fire is coming away
[3:31:51] foreign
[3:32:19] it's all Darkness
[3:32:21] fed
[3:32:22] and
[3:32:25] you are going and going forward
[3:32:32] we're talking with a brother as you know
[3:32:35] Judas is still rolling
[3:32:40] he betrayed
[3:32:43] God the son of God
[3:32:46] and Jesus said of it
[3:32:49] it is
[3:32:51] foreign
[3:33:00] he was talking of the terrible
[3:33:02] punishment
[3:33:05] that Judas was facing
[3:33:10] what did he say Aaron
[3:33:13] what Jesus what what did Jesus say
[3:33:18] ing
[3:33:20] amen amen amen now they think he was
[3:33:22] born whoa
[3:33:30] all right that's why it's a who unto
[3:33:34] foreign
[3:34:04] everywhere you go is money rituals
[3:34:10] and
[3:34:12] you know Satan can promise you 10
[3:34:15] billion
[3:34:18] but not for my Allah
[3:34:22] he will say bring that child
[3:34:28] and you'll get millions
[3:34:32] but
[3:34:34] it can be for three years
[3:34:39] you have to sign that San Jose that
[3:34:43] people don't mind today
[3:34:45] to sign for their Doom was
[3:34:50] their blood just to get
[3:34:54] Millions
[3:34:58] and fly a jet my flight is fun
[3:35:02] but the day every time
[3:35:05] party
[3:35:11] there's a man who went uh
[3:35:16] we we have done the first party
[3:35:20] to deal with
[3:35:22] this party I think God is going to
[3:35:26] answer our questions
[3:35:29] he went to magicians
[3:35:34] and it was also for money ritual he
[3:35:37] lived on Monday which one so
[3:35:40] they took him through their thing
[3:35:43] and he became a magician a federal
[3:35:46] magician
[3:35:47] well money was coming from this side
[3:35:52] you know
[3:35:54] you can buy a ship you can buy you know
[3:35:57] but nothing is
[3:36:03] you know that yeah
[3:36:07] they come with
[3:36:09] a note telling them this is for five
[3:36:12] years yeah five years
[3:36:16] some that man when the time arrives he
[3:36:21] knew it I see it
[3:36:23] he knew it
[3:36:25] he cried Allah
[3:36:28] telling the people now
[3:36:30] that or my time has come
[3:36:36] who would help him in such a situation
[3:36:40] he has sold his soul
[3:36:45] no there's no refund today
[3:36:50] once the soul is sold foreign
[3:37:03] my time
[3:37:05] has come knuckle
[3:37:09] we are blessed our time has come for
[3:37:15] to go yeah
[3:37:17] no not for to die
[3:37:22] amen amen now that's why
[3:37:27] a man without God
[3:37:29] can even
[3:37:32] put her his own soul on stage
[3:37:39] just for some papers
[3:37:41] then after that the soul is gone
[3:37:47] when he dies or she dies she's going
[3:37:51] through
[3:37:52] hey
[3:37:54] you can't talk about it
