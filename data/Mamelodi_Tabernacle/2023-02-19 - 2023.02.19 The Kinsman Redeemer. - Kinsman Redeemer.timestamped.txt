[11:04] to lose the souls thereof and no man in
[11:07] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[11:10] Earth was able to open the book neither

[18:33] interpretation
[18:39] sometimes the people know the people

[18:45] but whatever pyramid
[18:48] as naturally they even see a pyramid in
[18:52] Egypt
[18:56] but they don't know about the white
[18:58] stone
[19:01] which was within the pyramids
[19:09] it was there until seven Angels Came
[19:13] live
[19:15] with the interpretation
[19:19] of the stone within the pyramid
[19:27] while I was looking at that
[19:31] I also

[21:08] trying to stop him from speaking
[21:17] when I arrived from Tanzania then I was

[23:05] looked for
[23:08] a
[23:09] human Kingsman
[23:18] um
[23:25] okay
[23:28] um
[23:39] I'm in man you know take it easy
[23:42] yeah that's like
[23:45] a supernatural topic
[23:49] now did you know that John Luke for a
[23:52] human Kingsman
[23:58] [Music]
[24:01] house
[24:06] amen amen then I realized that yeah
[24:10] I was Redeemed
[24:12] by the blood of a king's men amen house
[24:22] is then I realized when I
[24:25] I receive these messages from
[24:28] the King's Men
[24:37] amen
[24:39] I see you you hear even this morning we
[24:41] are still receiving from the Kings May
[24:44] the king's
[24:46] is foreign
[25:13] let us first identify ourselves
[25:24] amen amen then I I realized
[25:28] the message is that we preach and have
[25:32] preached
[25:36] easy bringing together the keys foreign
[25:44] because
[25:46] it's from the king's main Redeemer Ultra
[25:50] moon
[25:54] now all the family members are
[25:57] connecting amen
[26:02] because it's one of the family members
[26:06] amen who died
[26:12] in order
[26:14] because I was I I remember last time

[26:25] yeah
[26:27] when I was struggling a bit to find my
[26:38] speaking about

[26:47] he quickly sent me the message
[26:52] she remind me of the page
[27:10] you know
[27:12] because
[27:13] he is to me a king's name
[27:21] so now I I'm trying to read something
[27:24] here
[27:26] [Applause]
[27:30] that's why
[27:31] when we we really go deeper into the
[27:36] Family Matters
[27:40] the people are not going to understand
[27:43] us
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:47] because it's only the people of the
[27:50] bloodline
[27:54] who will grasp the things that we are
[27:57] going through
[27:58] talk about
[28:02] all right amen
[28:05] and now I I quickly
[28:08] adjusted to myself to
[28:11] to this
[28:14] oh we were Redeemed by a king's men go
[28:22] Amen to bring back
[28:25] the key Kings folk who wishes
[28:31] [Music]
[28:32] to redeem them
[28:35] amen yes sir
[28:37] and
[28:39] it hasn't yet find a place in you is
[28:49] amen amen
[28:52] foreign
[29:09] [Applause]
[29:25] why I'm asking about this brother
[29:32] one of
[29:34] what I've got from him says
[29:39] they call me brother life
[29:42] brother life is
[29:45] brother Pele kasady okay okay
[29:51] because of the life we have
[29:55] my soul is alive
[30:01] and then
[30:03] so I remember
[30:05] in 2012 when I came here for the first
[30:09] time
[30:15] and
[30:18] down the line here he says and I met my
[30:23] equal Israel really
[30:30] do you know that brother they call
[30:33] Israel yes
[30:39] when he was talking
[30:42] I was sitting right there in the corner
[30:47] I looked at him
[30:50] okay amen now among them
[30:53] people the audience that day we are more
[30:57] uh
[30:59] they didn't realize there was a a king's
[31:03] men
[31:12] who has come to visit the King's Men
[31:20] yes
[31:22] then
[31:24] he says I I met my equal
[31:31] I don't know if the spirit has started
[31:33] to stand against or whatever
[31:37] and I met my equals
[31:44] now Joel if I weigh you hey I would say
[31:48] he's talking with me about me
[31:54] amen amen
[31:57] instead of saying he's talking about
[31:59] uh brother we called Israel
[32:10] once you are talking to one member
[32:15] you are talking to all them
[32:21] because it is a
[32:24] via bloodline is
[32:30] all right amen now that's why we
[32:33] recognize one another
[32:37] whether you are a million of kilometers
[32:40] away from here
[32:43] but they will still we will still fit in
[32:47] touch
[32:49] [Music]
[32:51] when do we get in touch
[32:55] when a Kingsman Maybe
[33:00] a million kilometers away foreign
[33:29] all right amen and
[33:33] the best news of the day yeah
[33:39] is to hear from your King's Men
[33:47] that will be the best
[33:51] the best news today
[34:00] uh
[34:05] this to me
[34:07] is a king's men talking to me not to the
[34:11] other person is
[34:17] if you can find two people talking about
[34:21] and they are family members
[34:26] you end up saying let me excuse you a
[34:29] bit while you are talking
[34:33] because the the communications
[34:41] you don't belong to the
[34:45] family family
[34:47] that's why when the family people come
[34:51] together
[34:53] sometimes they will say can you please
[34:56] add us excuse us
[35:01] we just want to come together
[35:05] uh
[35:09] the other people
[35:11] are not part of it
[35:14] they won't even understand it
[35:18] you must know that there are things a
[35:22] family would come together
[35:25] and have a meeting
[35:28] and the other person
[35:34] will never understand
[35:38] how about you
[35:39] I mean I mean now that's why at this end
[35:43] time ministry
[35:48] has opened up
[35:50] a conversation between the family
[35:53] members
[35:58] that's why he says no one will know
[36:00] about it
[36:05] that's the King's Men really
[36:07] the King's Men Redeemer
[36:10] we're coming to talk to the family
[36:12] members
[36:14] he says no one will will know it
[36:20] all right amen and um
[36:26] foreign
[37:00] he was looking for a
[37:04] uh something for their car
[37:09] we went to I think is Pretoria North I
[37:14] went with him
[37:16] now we arrive at a place where
[37:22] uh there's a notice body there notice
[37:25] Baltimore and uh
[37:29] it says here
[37:32] no
[37:35] no trust no uh no entry oh no entry
[37:42] say it
[37:44] no entry Beyond this point you still
[37:48] remember it
[37:50] no entry Beyond this
[37:52] foreign
[38:06] [Music]
[38:38] why it says no entry foreign
[39:07] amen amen
[39:10] so if it is not revealed to that one
[39:17] the family man
[39:19] it is amen
[39:35] look
[39:49] that's why the Bible says
[39:52] [Music]
[39:53] the Seed of Abraham
[39:57] is okay question
[40:00] that's right amen
[40:04] so jolly if if you are you are looking
[40:08] at that it is talking about the seeds
[40:15] the Seed of Abraham
[40:18] is Christ trusted
[40:24] and Christ himself
[40:29] he chose
[40:32] not
[40:33] he took not the form of the Angels
[40:37] the Bible says
[40:55] amen yeah yeah because he's a family man
[41:01] Abraham
[41:13] not sending a letter
[41:16] but he came to Abraham
[41:20] and Abraham recognized
[41:26] family yeah

[46:46] God spoke out of him
[46:51] yeah I'll tell you
[46:54] Peter Pedro he said
[46:59] who do men say that I the son of man
[47:05] they said some say you are Jeremiah
[47:11] and what did he say
[47:16] and then who do you say that Lena
[47:20] I the son of man
[47:25] now
[47:27] that was another class well you so if
[47:30] Elizabeth
[47:32] now there's classes something is
[47:34] Jeremiah some is saying
[47:41] the spiritual classes
[47:43] who do you say that I the son of man I
