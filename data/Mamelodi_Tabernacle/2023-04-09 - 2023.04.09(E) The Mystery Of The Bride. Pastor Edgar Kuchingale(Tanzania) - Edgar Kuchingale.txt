to the same book yeah the same book Genesis amen my brother you just go we are going to read a lot so amen Hallelujah I can come here and give you a service about five minutes but that would be childishness because why did I have to fly for four hours to come here and just stand here for five minutes and I sit down [Music] taking time these things between life and death one day you'll be

want to use the word [Music] you know you have been standing with the words so let's come back we are going back to the same male and female 26 my brother Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 26. and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the egg and over the kettle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth 27 so God created men in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created [Music] stay quiet foreign amen Hallelujah so uh this creation Hallelujah the creation was after the image of God so you and me uh uh we created after God amen amen so God had a purpose to have somebody who be like him hallelujah amen so if you can come to um Genesis let me just go back a little bit uh you forgive me let me just go back let's go back to uh Genesis because uh we'll read that it might not make sense now but it will make sense as a way amen so yes Revelation yes that one my brother yes and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written with pin and on the back side sealed with seven sealed Hallelujah so uh Danny and now outside of it Hallelujah don't imagine don't imagine as a man imagine as a spirit the book was was written on the outside hallelujah hallelujah so a man was formed in the form in the image of God hallelujah so if you come to Genesis 1 you find that man is created who looks like God who walked like God but if you come to Genesis chapter 2 that's where you find that uh the Bible says nothing grew up because man was not yet [Music] you think that Genesis 1. yeah and Genesis 2. there's so much there's so much repetition there's no limitation the word went out let's form let's create a man so a man who was created Mojo [Music] the first to come out came out of the Mask so for you God gave adam the godhood hallelujah hallelujah amen until some liar came let me let me show you you know

brother uh now yes now the second just a three verse one now the serpent was more subtle that than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yes ye have God have God said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said he shall not eat of it neither shall he touch it lest he died and the serpent said unto the woman he shall not surely die God says you shall die the serpent says um for God does know that in the day he eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as Gods knowing good and evil just imagine that it was here God created him in his image and he's coming to sell them but if you do this you'll be like God created them as Gods there was no way somebody should tell them that they will be gods because from the beginning God created them to be good amen so he's coming

Hallelujah you see there no so when you get married you marry somebody who looks like you sister if somebody calls you a dog just know he's a big dog unless he didn't marry somebody like him so when it came to Adam Hallelujah Charles didn't care what the word said let me stop there Jesus didn't care what the Bible said [Applause] whatever they can call us foreign [Music] so when you choose who to marry make sure you marry somebody of your character education amen amen we are finished with a BBC memories let's come to the Bible it's part of the Bible because it's now this is a what is written out outside the Bible let's go to the message be setting of God my brother give me the setting of God 59 is Row 1 25. just take that as a background amen are you there okay yes uh be certain of God

[Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I'll show you in the book believe God much more than the Jews [Music] calm down a little bit my brother and the land was burning up no doubt this little woman being of the believer type [Applause] for we see that God will not have called her a single he was a commuter if she wasn't Worthy [Applause] if she wasn't the wealthy one um [Applause] to entertain God's prophets foreign amen so you see the Karima of the woman was equal of the prophet amen amen so don't don't underrate yourself for the message do you know how many girls refuse to be in the message just because they cannot give up foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] amen amen if we are a very good football coach you'll tell your prayers my brother those other people are just like you only that they've put a lot of effort forward and Moses came to the Israel was God told him tell the people move forward what am I saying tell me what am I saying move forward [Applause] don't move backwards if you see a mountain what should you do okay amen if you say I see what you used to do foreign [Applause] [Applause] he he wants only to scare you can cook funny to go backwards uh you know one day it was very hot they were in the desert and they were only rocks I don't know how many of you if you are looking forward to go for the rock but uh [Music] no no no I wouldn't my brother according to science this is the most drip [Music] so one of the brothers said you know me in Egypt I was the one who was looking after Pharaoh's watermelona [Music] foreign [Music] think about where we are going there there's there are better things so let's go to Genesis let's see one of the woman let's just leave 12 and and 12 to 14. amen amen my brother think about forward don't think about it nothing better where we came from we haven't lost anything foreign amen yes my brother uh 12 and 14. and he said oh Lord God of my master Abram I pray this send me good spirit this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray this that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camel drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master Hallelujah now this is a book wishes has been written one part was given to Rebecca Rebecca give me a drink the other part left out which has happened to the Bible [Music] one part has been given to us the other part is outside because the one who tell you what is outside [Music] we should know that is the person who has been sent to us [Music] let's go to unveiling of God 64. 0 6 14. paragraph 22. amen they one part of the word was Kept Secret one part was given so that the one who brings this part which is uh a secret [Music] that's the one who belongs to the prince [Music] everybody also never know what it has been is what is outside let's lead together there so when uh when Rebecca was coming as my pastor always say he says that uh you know when uh women are are working at home they are not dressed at their best amen amen you know if she's going to draw water she should dress up on those clothes which are for work so if somebody is looking for a wife she goes to the workplace remember [Music] that was very good way of looking forward [Music] now my subject this morning I trust God will reveal this each time if you take the tips and I open trust that you have I hope that you have a spiritual understanding of what God is trying to get over to the church [Music] without saying it right out [Applause] God is trying to say something to his church but when he says it outright yeah so he says [Music] [Applause] sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might sin down it might bring some to go out some leaves when we say things the way the person was preaching here now uh no no no no here it is some might go out some might leave some might be wondering to ponder what's what does he want to say what does he want to say but that's done purpose [Applause] it must be done that way you know some of some of the people here are just waiting I'm just waiting for the day which the pastor will say something because they don't understand then go and start their own church so they already told each other they are coming to check they say the day which is just to say this is I'll go then it might be he does yet God will speak something which you tell us give some people a chance to move out one day say drink my blood and eat my friends he had 82 ministers with him 70 left 70 people agreed you know no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no brother according to the book you can't eat man's blood I totally agree with you my brothers [Music] and after they had lived the Lord turned around foreign [Applause] all right so some people have to change talking about the underworld we have gone to my wife anytime for me whenever I see something which is of the devil it's just the underworld [Music] no cap foreign [Music] [Applause] this was the central part of the teacher Foundation drink my blood eat my fresh that's the whole Center which you are here do you know right now we are eating the fresh here [Applause] how many knows that were the way I'm preaching here you're eating the Flesh of Jesus [Applause] ministers left the Church of Jesus I'm not saying church I'm just saying ministers amen so you see there when the when the the uh when uh Rebecca came [Music] back because that's where we meet they miss us they are they are all living inside too but there is the message of the foreign [Applause] [Music] outside the book we are able to understand what is inside because the prophet God has what was out left out but it was the part of this book [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] okay so Brandon was not there but Moses was there amen amen until uh what Moses left out brother gave us the Joker Moses amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's the same revelation [Applause] amen amen ah I didn't tell I didn't tell you the heading of the message The Mystery of the Bride [Applause] the bride is supposed to is the same material if it is not the same material it will end up as Charles and Diana [Music] people be saying oh she's so beautiful hey when she walks the police says she's not like me mama I made a mistake this this girl is not like me you you know divorce is costly she's not like me amen Hallelujah let's talk about another woman um I believe you know the story so let him received earlier are received men whom we didn't know what to assure the world they were seeing what's going on God Was preparing for his way because [Applause] [Applause] do you think if I have was married [Applause] everything which happened in levels you will see that her work prepare that for that because she was a that woman she told them before you leave me a token so they left a look talking until we can have a message today how many people condemned do they have whoa but the mystery of God foreign [Applause] [Applause] you are in this message by choice get out of here because because [Applause] [Music] I'm telling you if you can read the Bible you find that was telling the people I know God has given you this land because we have heard him and everybody in this city [Music] they are literally learning for fear although she was in that condition but because of predestination she was able to keep all the history I was able to believe she taught them I know let me let me read it for you it's not two this night [Music] the king didn't believe he was believing in his words Joshua Joshua Joshua Joshua 2 9. it's not Exodus so the king believe in the wars the soldiers you know the walls of Jericho were very big and they were believing in them foreign [Music] I know the Lord has given you land and your Terror has fallen on us and all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you didn't believe in the walls

life foreign [Music] don't fight him [Applause] until every king in Israel there is [Music] hey my brother foreign [Music] she was so impoverished until she had to be winnowing for grinning and
