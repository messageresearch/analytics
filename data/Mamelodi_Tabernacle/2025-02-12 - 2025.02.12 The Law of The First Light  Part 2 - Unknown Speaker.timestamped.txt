[0:00] for
[0:03] [Music]
[0:35] [Music]
[0:38] something amen or
[0:42] something okay because the Bible
[0:46] says there was war
[0:50] [Music]
[0:53] where Have You Ever Seen the war between
[0:56] God and Satan
[1:03] how how Fierce it
[1:09] was do you have an idea how the war of
[1:14] amagon is going is going to be
[1:22] like the prophet
[1:24] says it's going to be a very terrible
[1:27] War
[1:30] between light and
[1:35] darkness between the righteous and the
[1:41] UN amen amen you've never seen
[1:45] it so that
[1:50] Shook and shifted some
[1:55] things when Mel drew his SW
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] and fought the
[2:04] devil and
[2:07] Angels amen amen then that's
[2:11] why when the prophet looked through the
[2:17] dimensions he saw
[2:21] that this thing
[2:24] happening it is from another
[2:27] civilization
[2:32] this this is what caused the world to be
[2:38] void and even scientists don't have the
[2:41] answer to
[2:43] that
[2:51] amen
[2:54] and science knows about evolution
[3:01] and it doesn't
[3:03] exist I mean they are EV type of
[3:08] evolution men men at the beginning was
[3:13] like was an
[3:17] ape
[3:19] amen so they
[3:25] need okay here we we
[3:28] read now now and uh now the I believe
[3:33] the sea every seat was lying right there
[3:36] from some other
[3:44] civil because even the war in
[3:49] heaven could not misplace the
[3:56] seeds it could misplace them but it
[3:59] could
[4:00] [Music]
[4:07] destroy now when everything was
[4:12] domed and God said let there be
[4:17] light amen amen you will see what
[4:20] happens when there is
[4:24] light you are able to see
[4:30] the four
[4:32] quarters you are able to see what is
[4:36] coming you are able to see what is
[4:41] going as the pastor
[4:44] says no one can shift
[4:48] us why
[4:50] because you the
[4:53] darkness cannot overcome
[4:57] light amen amen say we know who we
[5:03] are we know where we come
[5:05] from we know where we
[5:08] are know where we are
[5:12] going amen amen ah we don't have to
[5:18] ask somebody to interpret
[5:21] it okay now here it
[5:23] says uh every seat was lying there from
[5:28] another civilization
[5:33] and as soon as the water lifted
[5:37] off you know when the light
[5:41] strike the water lifted
[5:44] off then come up the
[5:49] trees he says the same thing with the
[5:53] human
[5:55] being it's a
[6:00] woman and soon as the light
[6:05] struck amen amen and
[6:10] prostitution had to give
[6:14] way
[6:15] because the light has
[6:18] come and and a
[6:22] prostitution
[6:24] cannot H share with light the same place
[6:28] with the light
[6:32] amen so you see what is the very same
[6:37] thing how he did with the the
[6:42] Earth he did with you and
[6:47] me the Bible
[6:50] says listen to
[6:53] Ephesians I will read you quickly the
[6:55] book of Ephesians
[7:00] um Ephesians Ephesians Ephesians
[7:03] Ephesians
[7:04] chapter
[7:08] 5 I think it's verse eight let me check
[7:13] first for you were once Darkness but now
[7:17] are you light in the
[7:25] Lord
[7:27] right you were once
[7:32] Darkness but
[7:35] now you are
[7:38] light in the
[7:41] Lord walk as children of
[7:46] light you see the very same
[7:50] time your body types the
[7:57] Earth your soul types
[8:04] okay now let me pass
[8:07] here we have found
[8:09] it so there were seeds
[8:15] there and because the
[8:19] seeds now God said let there be
[8:24] light because down
[8:27] there there is some SE
[8:32] now let's find it here
[8:34] again because now the
[8:37] light has to bring
[8:40] life this
[8:43] SE both it must be both the
[8:52] natural because this one is
[8:57] natural which verse 14 says
[9:00] God created some
[9:07] lights that was
[9:09] for day and
[9:13] night now we have day and night
[9:17] here and we also
[9:20] have you hear of the the children of
[9:23] Night of the
[9:25] night and the children of the light
[9:29] you have both children of
[9:31] light and Children Of
[9:34] Darkness amen so God typed it all the
[9:39] way down to this
[9:43] age the natural typing the
[9:47] spiritual now it it's going to show that
[9:51] everything that we have here
[10:00] you if you are a
[10:03] Christian it's not a new
[10:07] thing because in the book who is this
[10:12] me prophet of God
[10:15] says if you have eternal
[10:19] life because you always
[10:27] had etal
[10:30] life do not start at a certain tent at
[10:34] the Revival
[10:42] spot no eternal
[10:46] life was eternal
[10:50] life who have eternal
[10:53] life they always had eternal
[11:00] whatever happened
[11:03] before could never change
[11:07] them
[11:09] amen but only what happened
[11:14] is look at the wise
[11:17] God WID of
[11:21] God now
[11:23] when when the the the the Earth was void
[11:30] and without any
[11:33] form God came to give it a
[11:39] form amen restore it back
[11:46] again and that's why another war is
[11:51] coming it is called the Battle
[11:56] of because the New Jerusalem is
[12:01] coming now the Jerusalem that we are
[12:04] going
[12:06] to is
[12:10] coming amen amen the Lord is
[12:13] coming the city is
[12:17] coming they are coming
[12:20] here so only the Bible
[12:23] says this Earth shall burn with fire
[12:32] it's not an
[12:35] analiation but shall only
[12:39] be yeah with
[12:44] fire then we are going to live right
[12:48] here in the new
[12:52] one and the Sea shall burn
[12:59] because the
[13:00] sea was the water that
[13:05] covered and the
[13:07] devil you know when then God
[13:10] said he separated the
[13:14] water and
[13:17] Satan went down with the
[13:23] water amen then he established himself
[13:29] [Music]
[13:31] under under the
[13:33] sea he's ever since operating from
[13:40] there he he he used to operate in
[13:48] space amen amen in
[13:52] space on the
[13:54] surface and
[13:57] under but he he has established himself
[14:04] under that's why if you read Revelation
[14:06] chapter
[14:08] 13 it speaks of a beast that came out of
[14:12] the
[14:16] sea which we need to look at that
[14:19] another
[14:22] time a beast that came out of the
[14:27] sea uh will happen during the
[14:30] tribulation
[14:33] period which is three and a half
[14:37] years the bride of Christ is not
[14:41] there that's why now the devil worship
[14:45] us they operate in three
[14:49] spheres amen no not in heaven he was
[14:53] cast out of
[14:56] Heaven the Bible says we battle against
[14:59] the the the the the the
[15:02] principalities yeah the principalities
[15:04] in the
[15:08] a not in heaven he was he was
[15:13] Michael defeated him and he was cast out
[15:17] of
[15:18] heaven but he has just established
[15:23] himself from
[15:26] space down here
[15:29] [Music]
[15:31] all right okay that's why now Our
[15:36] Gospel should come in
[15:39] three
[15:43] spheres worshiped in
[15:46] heaven
[15:48] and every KNE shall
[15:53] [Music]
[15:55] bow and John says
[15:59] heard me
[16:01] cry
[16:04] [Music]
[16:08] creature
[16:11] ration the angel that
[16:14] announced can I read it to you listen at
[16:18] this Angel what he
[16:20] saying Revelation 10 verse 5 10 verse 5
[16:24] it says and the angel whom I saw
[16:27] standing upon the sea and upon the Earth
[16:31] lifted up his hand to
[16:40] Heaven
[16:43] see upon
[16:47] the and the
[16:49] third he lifted up the the hand
[16:57] to he made sure that it's in three
[17:04] Realms verse six says and he saw by him
[17:07] who liveth forever and
[17:10] ever created heaven and the things that
[17:13] are in
[17:15] it the earth and the things that are in
[17:20] it the Sea and the things that are in
[17:23] it that there should be the time shall
[17:27] be no more
[17:31] so the the
[17:33] announcement is to the three
[17:39] dimensions heaven to the
[17:44] Sea amen am that's why now you have
[17:47] Revelation chapter
[17:50] 13 a beast from from the
[17:54] sea and Revelation 13: 11 1: 11 another
[18:00] beast from the
[18:03] earth and then
[18:06] because another one which is not a
[18:12] beast another one which is not a
[18:16] beast is coming from
[18:20] Heaven amen amen so it's always three
[18:23] the Lord
[18:25] also he comes with a a coverting
[18:32] from
[18:33] heaven with a book in
[18:36] his amen amen and one leg on the
[18:41] water one leg on the
[18:46] sea because there's a beast coming out
[18:49] of the
[18:50] water and the Beast coming out of the
[18:54] sea so when this one
[18:56] comes now this one is from heaven
[19:00] now amen amen because he said in book of
[19:05] Hebrews I shall make my my en my
[19:09] enemy my foot
[19:13] St so the Bible
[19:16] says one foot upon the
[19:19] Earth One upon the
[19:22] sea because the enemy is coming from the
[19:25] sea and from the Earth
[19:30] all right amen so you see now it's
[19:35] always
[19:37] three all right amen now this
[19:43] light this
[19:45] light now I'm I'm I'm trying to find
[19:49] something again
[19:52] here
[19:54] um which I must read
[20:00] okay okay okay hold on a
[20:05] bit this is a man that can turn on the
[20:09] light that can turn on the light of
[20:14] the he also says in this
[20:18] one if then the P
[20:22] page I'll bring the
[20:25] page okay but just listen to no no no no
[20:29] no the page is
[20:36] here now listen to
[20:38] this um in correspondence with the one
[20:41] we have just
[20:44] read from the book
[20:48] ofs now the
[20:52] seed God separate separated Darkness
[20:56] from light
[20:59] or light from
[21:01] Darkness he separates death from
[21:05] life he does it by his
[21:09] word now the seed was already upon the
[21:14] Earth God planted the
[21:17] seed just as long as the sun could get
[21:20] to that
[21:24] seed now at that time it was Darkness
[21:30] now God had to open
[21:33] up for the light to catch the
[21:38] sea just
[21:40] like
[21:42] denominations we were
[21:45] religion was like voidness of the
[21:53] church amen you could not even see the
[21:57] church which one is the church of
[22:00] Christ the
[22:02] bride because it was all
[22:08] Darkness but down
[22:15] there until God
[22:17] said let there be
[22:20] light let there be
[22:22] light that
[22:25] very had to come in this
[22:30] Ag and Zar
[22:32] said it be
[22:35] light evening
[22:38] time why
[22:40] because both the the morning
[22:44] light one is the morning
[22:47] light one is the morning
[22:50] light one is the
[22:55] evening so that very same Morning Light
[23:00] is the same even in
[23:03] light that even in
[23:06] [Music]
[23:07] light is the same the Lord Jesus
[23:12] says like
[23:15] lightening from the other part of the
[23:18] earth the other part of that's how he
[23:21] will
[23:24] come shining forth from the other
[23:27] part to the other
[23:30] part now it's not two
[23:33] Lightnings it's one lightning from the
[23:37] other part to the
[23:39] other amen so meaning that it is the the
[23:44] same
[23:46] [Music]
[23:47] Christ all right amen now when he was on
[23:51] the
[23:53] earth he was with
[23:56] them in the form of
[24:01] Jesus all
[24:03] right and then he had to come now to
[24:07] us in the form of a
[24:12] man but
[24:14] since we were born of the men and the
[24:21] woman the Lord had to cover
[24:25] that by
[24:27] coming to that
[24:29] flesh born of the man and the
[24:35] woman in order to change that
[24:42] body maybe you didn't hear our
[24:47] bodies came not like the body of Jesus
[24:51] Christ body of Jesus
[24:53] Christ came not through Mary and Joseph
[25:00] it was through an Angel and the
[25:04] [Music]
[25:06] woman it is Gabriel who came to the
[25:08] woman not
[25:12] Joseph what he brought to the
[25:15] woman was life from
[25:20] God the
[25:22] word into
[25:26] Mary and when Mary lived that
[25:30] way then that
[25:37] materal then when it
[25:40] materialized it became
[25:42] blood and it is called the blood of
[25:46] God the blood of
[25:51] God that was in the in a vision sorry it
[25:56] was in a vision
[26:00] all right amen so now in the last
[26:03] days God had to do
[26:06] it to bring now the
[26:10] we our
[26:12] body which was
[26:15] not which was
[26:18] born of the man and the
[26:22] woman now to bring that to bring that in
[26:26] our body
[26:30] it came by an
[26:33] Angel am Hallelujah the seventh
[26:38] angel brought the
[26:41] word to the
[26:45] bride Glory you know
[26:49] finally because when the the messenger
[26:54] came he is a man like you and me
[26:58] and then that was a church
[27:05] age now Mary was a natural
[27:09] woman there came an angel from
[27:13] Heaven to
[27:15] Mary and that's how the son
[27:20] came and the Lord Jesus is
[27:24] coming but he through it the same way
[27:29] the bride of
[27:31] Christ and
[27:34] theel amen amen now brother
[27:40] Brenham the angel
[27:42] to the
[27:49] churches but
[27:51] later he introduced an angel from
[27:55] eternity
[27:59] now that is that angel coming to the
[28:03] bride and the bride will give
[28:09] birth that's
[28:12] right
[28:14] now you see where is
[28:17] going it's not just believing the
[28:21] message it's something that God has
[28:26] done and is here at theend
[28:30] time amen amen what makes these
[28:34] pastors to
[28:36] believe the way they
[28:39] believe no it's not
[28:42] because of their
[28:45] wisdom it is
[28:47] because it is from
[28:51] there amen amen so you can't change
[28:55] them because even the battle there
[28:58] couldn't change
[29:02] them so nothing can change
[29:05] them if it is an original
[29:09] seed if it is an original se you cannot
[29:13] change
[29:16] it right amen you can say what you
[29:23] want Facebook can say the way it wants
[29:26] to say
[29:28] it will never change
[29:32] us because there is a Facebook church
[29:35] church Facebook amen amen but it shall
[29:40] not go
[29:45] unchallenged
[29:47] because they are the Facebook Facebook
[29:51] Facebook we are the Lamb's Book
[29:53] [Music]
[29:56] of Amen
[30:00] so that's that's the the
[30:04] difference all right we don't use
[30:07] Facebook to
[30:13] speak we are
[30:16] the of Life L's Book of
[30:21] Life we talk to the
[30:26] people if there something
[30:29] wrong we we we use the
[30:33] Bible brother you have done wrong
[30:38] here but the people who are not in the
[30:44] L's Book of Life they use
[30:47] Facebook Facebook amen
[30:51] amen those in the book of
[30:55] God they use the book of God
[31:01] God's
[31:03] book verus
[31:09] Facebook I'm working on
[31:13] that we are

[34:00] [Music]
[34:01] and communicated unto them that gospel
[34:05] which I preach among the
[34:10] Gentiles but privately to them who were
[34:13] of reputation lest by any means I should
[34:16] run or had run in
[34:26] vain I went there
[34:31] by and

[35:16] people to come out of this
[35:20] things and come back to the
[35:22] Bible to the word of
[35:25] God all right amen okay
[35:28] now for a few
[35:30] minutes yeah we are here now I think
[35:34] we've done gone through
[35:37] that I wanted us to
[35:41] realize there's two different things
[35:44] there in
[35:48] Genesis this
[35:51] light chapter 1 verse
[35:54] one is different from the lights
[35:58] 1 verse
[36:01] 14
[36:03] verse you see it's two different
[36:08] things amen one is chapter one verse
[36:13] one verse one which a certain
[36:18] scientist he
[36:20] said we don't know about that
[36:24] one I've got the book at
[36:26] home he says we don't know about this
[36:31] light of of Genesis 1
[36:39] verse1 a
[36:42] scientist he understands verse 1 verse
[36:51] 14 because it
[36:53] says natur
[36:59] [Music]
[37:00] the stars is
[37:03] different amen okay now for for can you
[37:08] survive 5 minutes all right listen for 5
[37:14] minutes I'm going back to the Book of
[37:18] Genesis because the first
[37:22] light the spoken
[37:25] word the first light is the spoken word
[37:32] if you are in
[37:34] darkness and you can't see
[37:37] around you you can't see what is coming
[37:40] what is
[37:41] going you need
[37:45] light I remember one
[37:48] day we were
[37:52] at now
[37:57] around us is
[38:02] Bush now we had a
[38:06] powerful lamp
[38:09] there had one powerful
[38:13] light
[38:16] um what they call them now okay anyhow
[38:19] it's camping camping
[38:23] L now during the
[38:25] night we flushed
[38:29] light and that thing is powerful it
[38:33] casts a very powerful
[38:37] beam spting like
[38:41] this then we realize that not far from
[38:45] us not far from us there were some
[38:49] animals drinking
[38:53] water
[38:56] the zebras
[39:00] but without that we couldn't know that
[39:07] Ze so you
[39:12] need because with
[39:14] light your
[39:17] eyes are only
[39:21] limited
[39:24] amen they've got some limits
[39:28] but
[39:29] light you can have
[39:32] ice but when when it is dark like in
[39:38] Egypt they don't
[39:42] work have you seen people Especial
[39:45] people from the
[39:47] cities when they arrive in the remote
[39:51] areas they work like this
[39:57] amen they can't
[39:59] see maybe
[40:02] somebody living
[40:05] there to lead
[40:07] them because now the light of the one
[40:12] living
[40:14] there not
[40:16] the amen it is what is
[40:23] recorded all right amen now that person
[40:26] knows that
[40:28] this way there's no holy here
[40:33] or there's nothing here or a
[40:36] stone no he he he doesn't need to open
[40:39] his
[40:42] eyes because already it is programmed
[40:48] in amen that's why now the people while
[40:51] they are
[40:53] talking while the people are
[40:55] talking they don't know that the things
[40:59] that we believe are programmed in
[41:04] US amen amen and programmed and sealed
[41:08] by
[41:12] God that's why when
[41:15] pilate he said to Jesus are you the king
[41:19] of the Jews
[41:27] you have you have said it
[41:29] already it is registered it is it is
[41:34] programmed amen amen
[41:38] so yeah you already said it
[41:41] amen if somebody comes and
[41:44] say I hear that you are
[41:47] saying you are Min
[41:51] Gods you already said
[41:53] [Applause]

[42:00] God said let us make men in our
[42:06] image that man is a minor
[42:15] God I hear that
[42:18] said you say
[42:23] you you are one with God
[42:27] already

[43:03] seed it
[43:07] shows the
[43:12] predestinated will
[43:14] read you will see that it is the very
[43:18] same
[43:20] light the light that has opened up your
[43:24] your eyes
[43:27] the light that has revealed who you
[43:32] are is the very same
[43:36] light that
[43:38] recognized that down in this water water
[43:44] here under this
[43:47] Darkness there
[43:50] seed there is the Earth and there is the
[43:54] sea that very same light

[44:05] here just the same as you are the
[44:09] Earth your body your body is
[44:13] the and the inside of this
[44:17] Earth the light

[50:49] in our heavenly father we just want to
[50:52] thank
[50:53] you again this evening
[50:57] for teaching out to us your
[50:59] word which know
[51:02] man there's no one who can touch our
[51:06] hearts like your
[51:08] word father like you so we are here this
[51:12] evening thanking you for the word that
[51:15] came this way and for the blessings upon
[51:18] us yes and I believe that everyone who
[51:22] entered this place and was afflicted a
[51:26] has has got no reason to say I am still
[51:28] sick yes because father I've seen the
[51:31] people coming in and they would give
[51:35] their hearts to God and God will deal
[51:38] with them in a very perfect way until
[51:42] all their diseases they will live under
[51:46] the impact of the message and the
[51:49] Revelation that is coming from God and
[51:52] that's why we believe that even this
[51:54] evening some of us came in here and we
[51:58] were sick when we entered this building
[52:01] but some of us are going back without
[52:04] any sick sickness or disease because the
[52:07] impact of your word as brother Brenham
[52:10] says the word is a great healer and
[52:13] father we believe that even tomorrow
[52:15] coming to the service those that are
[52:18] sick will not remain home because this
[52:20] is the place the place of restoration
[52:24] and where the sick get gets
