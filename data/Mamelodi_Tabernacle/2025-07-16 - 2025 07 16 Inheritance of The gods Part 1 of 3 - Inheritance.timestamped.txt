[0:03] [Music]
[0:30] God bless you.
[0:33] H if we may turn to our Bibles again
[0:38] starting from the book of Genesis
[0:41] chapter 1 verse 26- 27.
[0:47] Let's just offer a prayer.
[0:53] We are here again together in this place
[0:56] this morning knowing no one but you.
[1:09] We commit all the souls that are under
[1:11] this roof unto your hands knowing that
[1:14] you are here to bless us. For the word
[1:16] says where two or three are gathered
[1:18] together, you are in the midst.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; So we believe that we can feel your
[1:22] presence
[1:23] &gt;&gt; that you are with us this morning.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; We looked around this morning for a
[1:28] place where we can go for to worship.
[1:30] And we have realized that this is the
[1:32] place
[1:38] as we open the book
[1:48] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[1:51] Let's turn to Genesis 1 verse 26- 27.
[2:01] We just want to look at this um a
[2:05] subject
[2:08] inheritance of of the gods
[2:14] &gt;&gt; and we'll take a text
[2:17] a super race
[2:20] all from
[2:22] all by the end time messenger.
[2:27] Amen.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; A man who contained all the mysteries,
[2:35] the seventh angel messenger.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; And now we are the seventh
[2:42] church age.
[2:46] But then now we are beyond the church
[2:48] ages.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Standing just before the
[2:55] king's chamber
[3:00] and the prophet says, "You come to the
[3:03] chimps king's chamber,
[3:08] one standing there
[3:11] to introduce you to the king."
[3:15] Amen. Amen. Now I believe that we we
[3:18] have reached the place
[3:22] Amen.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; That's why the Lord today is no longer
[3:27] the way to us.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; We have now reached the place
[3:35] and God has reached his place
[3:38] that is the third place
[3:41] the soul of man.
[3:44] So the prophet says that's that's where
[3:46] he is today.
[3:49] Not in heaven
[3:51] but in the bride.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; H So um now if we can realize who we
[4:00] are,
[4:04] we will leave this place with a
[4:06] rapturing blessing.
[4:10] If we can realize who we are,
[4:14] whether it is intori.
[4:22] [Music]
[4:39] Amen.
[4:40] I think we should thank the Lord
[4:44] and give him honor for what we are,
[4:49] who we are.
[4:52] Just like brother Brenham,
[4:54] how we would run around a tree
[5:00] in the bush
[5:02] just by thinking about God
[5:06] and what he made him to be.
[5:10] And one time he was looking at an eagle
[5:14] and eagle landed there.
[5:19] Amen. And it was just taking steps.
[5:25] Brother was looking at that
[5:29] and he says he heard something also
[5:32] another animal calling out somewhere.
[5:37] And he started to cry like a baby
[5:42] because of the presence of the Lord.
[5:46] Seeing an eagle made him to cry.
[5:51] Amen. Oh, Matthew I mean Genesis 1 verse
[5:55] 26- 27.
[6:00] Genesis 1 verse 26- 27.
[6:07] Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Uh, if you could use the mic, please.
[6:25] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[6:28] image, after our likeness, and let them
[6:31] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[6:34] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[6:36] the kettle, and over all the earth, and
[6:39] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[6:41] upon the earth." So God created man in
[6:44] his own image. In the image of God
[6:46] created he him, male and female created
[6:50] he them.
[6:52] and first John 3 verse 1 2 3
[7:09] Behold what manner of love the Father
[7:12] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[7:15] called the children of God. Therefore
[7:18] the world knoweth us not because it knew
[7:20] him not. Beloved, now are we the
[7:24] children of God, and it does not yet
[7:27] appear what we shall be, but we know
[7:30] that when he shall appear, we shall be
[7:33] like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you.
[7:46] U
[7:48] now in the Bible
[7:51] we realize that God made man in his own
[7:54] image
[7:59] and uh
[8:01] let me turn to this book again.
[8:04] Blasphemous names
[8:10] or rather
[8:12] Another
[8:14] book,
[8:17] &gt;&gt; the masterpiece.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; God made men in his
[8:24] &gt;&gt; image.
[8:29] Then I'll take you back to
[8:33] the book again.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; As God began to work upon creeping
[8:41] things,
[8:45] page 10 of this masterpiece
[8:50] and uh
[8:53] little animals
[8:55] on earth. Then he began to bring it from
[8:58] the from that into something else
[9:02] higher.
[9:07] And man was already there in the spirit
[9:11] form.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; So God created things for his sons,
[9:21] the garden of Eden
[9:24] headquarters.
[9:25] Then finally he brought it into the
[9:27] larger animals
[9:30] such as lions, tiger
[9:34] and he brought it into the life of
[9:38] monkeys
[9:41] and so forth.
[9:44] Not an evolution as we think.
[9:48] That was complete creation.
[9:54] God working
[9:56] on a pattern.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; But finally there came from
[10:02] forth upon the earth
[10:08] a perfection
[10:11] &gt;&gt; and that was a man.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; So that means God's perfection is
[10:23] amen.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is perfected in a man.
[10:29] Father, Son, Holy Ghost,
[10:32] Holy Ghost is God in a man.
[10:37] That is the a three-fold
[10:40] revelation of God.
[10:45] Finally,
[10:46] there came forth upon the earth
[10:50] what God calls perfection.
[10:54] And that was a man.
[10:58] So you must always remember that
[11:01] perfection is a man.
[11:05] God is perfected in three,
[11:08] father, son, and holy ghost.
[11:11] That holy ghost speaks of God in three.
[11:18] So that's why it's perfected in three.
[11:22] That's why the seventh seal,
[11:26] &gt;&gt; we have realized that the seventh seal
[11:28] is a man.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; God is completed in a man.
[11:39] The Bible also says we are complete in
[11:42] him.
[11:44] And God is complete in a man.
[11:49] That's why he says at that day you shall
[11:51] know that I am in you.
[11:55] Amen.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; And uh even the third pool
[12:01] souls in prison tells me that
[12:06] pool was that man who came to Abraham.
[12:13] The third pool is a man.
[12:17] Seven is a man.
[12:21] Amen.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Now,
[12:25] if you can follow God
[12:30] and you don't come to where it is a man
[12:35] or to where he is a man,
[12:40] then you must know that
[12:43] You were deceived.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Now in the garden of Eden,
[12:54] &gt;&gt; uh the only visible form there was Adam.
[13:00] For God is a spirit.
[13:04] We could not see God.
[13:07] We could see Adam.
[13:10] Amen. That image of God
[13:14] &gt;&gt; for now
[13:18] uh finally
[13:21] there came upon the earth a perfection.
[13:24] Now this perfection was a man.
[13:28] Then God could see in that man
[13:32] that looked like.
[13:39] Now let's repeat it again.
[13:44] As we have said,
[13:46] man is God's mirror.
[13:48] [Music]
[13:51] &gt;&gt; When he looked at that man,
[13:54] he saw himself
[13:59] being God.
[14:02] Being God, he created a God.
[14:09] Amen.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet is going to
[14:13] address us.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; He's just going to tell us who we are.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; God created or made another God.
[14:30] So, Adam was another God
[14:35] under God.
[14:39] Then that's why now he was engaged in
[14:42] this contract.
[14:46] The prophet says
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Adam
[14:50] was the other.
[14:54] The other part of the contract
[14:59] for God
[15:02] created things.
[15:04] And the Bible tells us he brought them
[15:06] to Adam
[15:10] to see what he would call them
[15:13] because Adam was the other side of the
[15:15] continent.
[15:19] So God being the God of the universe
[15:24] and much God.
[15:27] Amen. And now the the network was
[15:31] between God and his son.
[15:36] We repeat these things for a while.
[15:41] When he look at that
[15:44] looks so much like him.
[15:48] So now when he looked upon him
[15:53] upon this man, he was a reflection of
[15:56] what his creator was.
[16:04] So
[16:06] that's why we are blessed.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; He said blessed
[16:15] &gt;&gt; is your eye
[16:17] to see these things
[16:20] and your ears
[16:22] to hear these things. How that God the
[16:26] Almighty
[16:28] made you in his own image.
[16:32] You
[16:34] small God
[16:38] under God.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; That means you can only deal with
[16:45] another God.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] In looking for a partner,
[16:57] he had to find somebody
[17:00] with the qualities
[17:03] of himself.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:09] He was looking for a perfect partner.
[17:14] That partner was supposed to qualify
[17:18] to God.
[17:23] That's why even today
[17:25] people God can deal with.
[17:33] Is that so? Pastor.
[17:38] Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; The only people
[17:42] God can engage in a contract with
[17:46] is another God.
[17:51] Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; So that's why he made sure that
[17:57] this man in his own image
[18:01] so that man can be what he is.
[18:08] All right. It looked like him.
[18:13] That's why the prophet says
[18:16] when the bride
[18:20] at the end time
[18:22] &gt;&gt; will still come to that.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; He says the bride
[18:26] &gt;&gt; will be so much like him.
[18:33] You will find one in this place,
[18:37] one in Mosul Bay,
[18:39] one in
[18:42] you realize that it's the same.
[18:46] [Music]
[18:49] Amen.
[18:50] He said they will be so much like him.
[18:55] They will be even in his own image.
[19:00] He will come
[19:02] to to connect
[19:06] to the other to the gods
[19:11] his sons.
[19:12] Now Luke chapter 3
[19:17] tells you that Adam
[19:20] the son not a son
[19:22] &gt;&gt; the son of God
[19:27] Adam.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when he lost the title,
[19:32] God had to intervene
[19:36] to make a a plan of redemption
[19:41] in order to close that gap
[19:45] because he missed his partner so dearly.
[19:50] He had to die,
[19:53] his partner back again in life.
[19:58] Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; That was God's
[20:06] &gt;&gt; struggling.
[20:10] God was struggling to bring back
[20:15] this minor God
[20:17] in line.
[20:20] [Music]
[20:22] The cross means that
[20:25] &gt;&gt; the resurrection means that
[20:29] &gt;&gt; why he came
[20:32] for that.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet says he can only redeem the
[20:38] redeemable.
[20:43] Amen. Amen. because that is his own
[20:46] part,
[20:48] his own image.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because through this partner,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; he could do things.
[21:04] That's why the seventh messenger
[21:09] is that restoration.
[21:15] And you know, traveling back again
[21:20] &gt;&gt; after
[21:22] Adam
[21:25] fell,
[21:28] &gt;&gt; God drove them out of the garden
[21:34] through the east gate.
[21:38] Now you know Adam was pleased eastward.
[21:43] And the Bible says the Lord is coming
[21:45] from the
[21:47] So Eden.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; And what was this garden
[22:00] of Eden?
[22:04] &gt;&gt; You know what was the garden of Eden?
[22:08] Uh let's check here
[22:11] &gt;&gt; at this garden of Eden.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[22:19] &gt;&gt; I will start it from here.
[22:24] Now the spirit of God moved upon the
[22:27] face of the waters.
[22:30] That is in the book of Genesis
[22:33] because the prophet says why the spirit
[22:36] was upon the waters
[22:40] and the earth was void
[22:43] form
[22:46] covered in water.
[22:48] So the prophet says
[22:50] the seeds were already there.
[22:56] That's why now the spirit in the form of
[22:58] a rainbow
[23:03] the waters
[23:07] because there were seeds.
[23:12] Amen. Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; If you see the rain a rainbow token,
[23:18] &gt;&gt; you know that beneath that the seeds,
[23:23] &gt;&gt; if you see a church with a rainbow,
[23:27] that below that there's God's
[23:34] token of the covenant
[23:35] [Music]
[23:37] showing that God's people.
[23:42] [Music]
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; So, uh it says
[23:49] &gt;&gt; the power of transformation page eight.
[23:54] The world was in darkness,
[23:57] in chaos.
[23:59] What a horrible shape it must have been
[24:01] in.
[24:04] But way into the darkness yonder,
[24:11] without light or anything.
[24:15] And the churning of the water and that
[24:19] wandering star twisted around.
[24:26] in the orbits
[24:28] out there somewhere.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; It must have been a terrific mass of
[24:34] something else
[24:38] like it couldn't find its way.
[24:44] And that's what we become when we became
[24:47] wandering stars,
[24:51] away from God, without hope, without
[24:54] God.
[24:57] Amen. In darkness,
[24:59] and God took that great chaos of
[25:01] darkness,
[25:05] put it into a garden of Eden.
[25:12] Amen. Amen.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Just like he took that prostitute
[25:18] &gt;&gt; and transform her into
[25:25] Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Transform the Garden of Eden by
[25:29] God's word.
[25:33] Let there be light.
[25:36] mass of creation out there
[25:40] come over around the sun
[25:44] and began to revolve around the sun
[25:49] and became a garden of Eden
[25:52] because it obeyed the word of God.
[25:57] The garden of Eden was there as a
[25:59] believer.
[26:02] It obeyed the word of God.
[26:06] We have just seen the tabernacle behind
[26:08] the pastor's house.
[26:11] A place had obeyed the word of God.
[26:16] And now it it can accommodate the people
[26:19] who obeyed the word of God.
[26:25] That means if you obey the word of God,
[26:29] God will place you in a place,
[26:32] the same place that obeyed the word of
[26:34] God,
[26:38] the holy ground.
[26:42] Amen. Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; When Moses obeyed God,
[26:47] God made the ground holy.
[26:53] Amen.
[26:54] Then he took that chaos.
[27:00] Isn't he wonderful?
[27:03] He can take a drunkard,
[27:06] a prostitute,
[27:08] a weak person,
[27:10] transform him or her
[27:13] into a wonderful
[27:17] being.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; So, do you believe that?
[27:26] It became a garden of Eden
[27:30] because
[27:32] it obeyed
[27:34] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; It done the perfect will of God
[27:41] for it was transformed.
[27:44] and everything or everything that was
[27:47] transformed by God
[27:50] obeyed the word of God.
[27:53] Whether it's a garden,
[27:56] whether it's a plant,
[27:58] whether it's marine life,
[28:01] everything
[28:03] transformed,
[28:05] obeyed the word of God,
[28:08] whether it's a tabernacle.
[28:12] Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:14] A house transformed in the in a
[28:16] tabernacle.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; For that house of the pastor obeyed the
[28:21] way
[28:25] and the obedience shall come and worship
[28:27] in them.
[28:31] Amen. Amen.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Now it done the perfect will of God for
[28:35] it was transformed from chaos into a
[28:37] garden of Eden by the word of God.
[28:46] now. That's what we are here for.
[28:54] That's my me my message
[28:57] as being all along the word of God.
[29:02] So, we must hold to that
[29:05] regardless of what other things take
[29:07] place.
[29:09] Always stay with that word.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Always check out your motives,
[29:21] &gt;&gt; objectives. Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Stay always with
[29:28] Joshua said to them, "Stay in the middle
[29:31] of the road,
[29:33] &gt;&gt; with the ark.
[29:36] [Music]
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Don't look to the right.
[29:40] Don't look
[29:43] the word.
[29:46] The word will see you through.
[29:49] [Music]
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Always check out your motives and
[29:55] if it's according to the word of God,
[29:58] amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Then he says,
[30:02] &gt;&gt; now
[30:06] we are going to get to this
[30:09] Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Now this garden.
[30:21] Amen. Amen.
[30:30] Amen.
[30:32] Now you still can hear us.
[30:36] Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Now we find out
[30:46] that after he had he had it
[30:55] kind
[31:00] it was all put by the word of God.
[31:06] the creator.
[31:09] We find that this all
[31:13] headed up in a headquarters.
[31:21] When God created grass,
[31:24] trees, and so forth,
[31:26] it was for man.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; God wanted to make a place
[31:35] for his son.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Then he started by creating things
[31:45] &gt;&gt; to make that garden of Eden
[31:48] a place for his son.
[31:52] Amen. Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And it all we'll find out that this all
[31:56] headed in a headquarters
[32:00] called the garden of Eden.
[32:05] And God put his son
[32:08] his son bright over it all
[32:13] &gt;&gt; because he said subdue it rule over it.
[32:20] Now this great creation
[32:24] he had a reason for it.
[32:26] He made everything everything so pretty.
[32:32] He made the flowers
[32:35] in the life and the base and there was
[32:39] no death, no sin, no sorrow,
[32:43] no sickness.
[32:45] And then all this great thing
[32:48] headed up into the big headquarters
[32:53] which was the garden of Eden.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And there he put his son
[33:02] in this headquarters.
[33:04] [Music]
[33:07] Brother Brenam says
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Eden was God's headquarters.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; The Garden of Eden,
[33:16] &gt;&gt; the Garden of Eden,
[33:20] his son's headquarters.
[33:23] So they both owned head headquarters.
[33:29] God had his headquarters,
[33:33] his son, his headquarters.
[33:37] [Music]
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Can one say amen to God? Amen.
[33:44] Amen.
[33:46] So the system was from the headquarters
[33:50] today.
[33:55] Amen.
[33:58] not not to something under power.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; That's when we can see our equality with
[34:07] God.
[34:11] Then he would create a thing.
[34:14] Then he will take it to Adam
[34:17] to see what Adam would call
[34:21] and whatever Adam said,
[34:25] "Amen in God.
[34:28] Amen.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Because God entrusted
[34:36] &gt;&gt; the kingship.
[34:38] Amen.
[34:39] He made him a God.
[34:43] So whatever Adam said,
[34:47] amen with God.
[34:49] Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; That's why he brought the seventh angel
[34:55] messenger.
[34:59] and trusted him with all the mysteries.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; And then
[35:09] &gt;&gt; he brought the seven church ages
[35:12] &gt;&gt; and the messengers
[35:14] to the seventh angel messenger.
[35:19] And the seventh angel messenger,
[35:24] God just put it before him to see
[35:27] what he would do.
[35:30] Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Then he took a board and said,
[35:35] "This is the first church age."
[35:39] Amen.
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] &gt;&gt; And Paul is the first messenger.
[35:47] And God said, "Amen with fire."
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; The same thing.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; God answered
[36:03] &gt;&gt; with fire
[36:05] &gt;&gt; and confirmed what brother Brennan grew.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:14] like he did with Elijah.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; He confirmed
[36:22] &gt;&gt; the sacrifice with fire
[36:29] and I believe that
[36:31] God still going to confirm.
[36:35] [Music]
[36:36] Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; You know I have said h just previous
[36:42] week
[36:44] of God.
[36:47] How Moses
[36:49] he cast down his rod
[36:54] and the others also
[36:57] leave their ros
[37:02] and Moses was just waiting for a
[37:04] confirmation
[37:09] that to see whose rod is whose.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Now you move around now today.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; You can see the floor is full of rods
[37:25] now.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And we are waiting for the confirmation.
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:34] Amen.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; You're through a lot.
[37:42] God's rod. The rod of Moses was called
[37:45] God's rod.
[37:49] The Bible called it God's rod.
[37:55] So he cast down God's rod.
[37:59] And you know there was Baptist rod this
[38:07] everybody came with his rod.
[38:11] cast it down.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Then Moses knew that
[38:20] &gt;&gt; come on the scene
[38:22] to confirm.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Suddenly
[38:27] the rod of Moses
[38:30] &gt;&gt; started to stand up like this.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And he followed all the roads.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And as I say, he didn't bulge.
[39:02] annalated them.
[39:12] [Music]
[39:14] Amen.
[39:17] Let them cast their rods
[39:20] and he's going to shallow them all.
[39:26] [Music]
