Description:
Title: The New Commission
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 08 October 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The  Pastor read the following scripture:
Revelation 8:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the new commission, which is the commission of Angels

The pastor quoted the SpokenWords of 63-0324E - The Seventh Seal par 304 
 You notice. Notice now, for the end-of-time Message, this Seal. After all, He—He has revealed all the six Seals, but He don’t say nothing about the Seventh. And the end-time Seal, when It starts, will be absolutely a total secret, according to the Bible, before knowing That. At the end of the seventh angel’s Message, all the mysteries of God would be known.” We’re at the end time, the opening of the Seventh Seal.

The Seventh Seal was not preached it was opened. The people are waiting for the Seventh Seal but the Bride has received it. It is the end of all things. You can’t preach a mystery but you can open the mysteries. 

The time of the Gentiles is over, now is time for the Jews to come in.

He had to go west to connect with these Angels’ Message, and he had to return East. In the garden of Eden man was placed East.
The first  Commission was praying for the sick and the second one is of the Angels 

Rebecca was a special woman, she remained on the camel until she could see Isaac, even today the bride remained until she could see the husband. 
No other women could talk about Isaac beside Rebecca. No other person can talk about the Seventh Seal beside The bride. 

The bride of Christ has arrived to that place to see Isaac. The mystery of the bride comes after the Opening of the Seventh Seal. Every time God speaks you can only hear him in the Constellation. 
The Seventh Seal is not known to the public but it is known to the ones that are in the constellation.

going to read the word and I still know my brother Larry um we are still looking forward to see uh what's happening [Applause] now will come with that what's happening in Israel Gentiles amen amen so that time has come the time of the Gentiles is over amen are you Gentiles is the time of the Gentiles is over it's time for the Jews to come in amen amen now we are looking forward to that uh firstly when you see us maybe coming after some hours it is that the CH the time has changed to something amen [Music] amen theight is really going [Music] up the flight is now going up all right amen that's why sometimes you see us this time right now we are left with some few minutes firstly we'll come back uh we'll start with one part which is important also the order I was reading this where the Prophet when we come the first thing in the house of the Lord we don't talk to one another when we come we just we are in the house now sometimes you find some talking even laughing and so I will read it next time amen amen you know it's getting very serious now because the Rapture is just around the now I'm I'm still following uh is the Jews the Gentiles then we'll see the time for the Jews and the Gentiles God will help us with that but as for now for the remaining minutes I'm going to read something here which I have seen here and I want overdue with time amen amen I'm going back to to that pleas the the new commission and maybe you will hear today what it means the new commission the new commission but let me read to you something here actually we are going to read Revelation chap 8 verse1 let's start by reading that scripture then we'll look continue on the new commission which is the commission of Angel amen amen all right amid of angels but Revelation 8 verse1 Revelation 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour right amen you you may be seated okay I will read to you something here when we come next time we'll continue we look at the order and continue now here I read you notice that is SS 564 564 you notice now for the End of Time message this seal that is the seventh he's revealed all the six [Music] SS but it don't say nothing about the seventh uh I will suggest to the brothers just to switch this one behind me off because so that I can keep the quality of my voice [Music] amen for the sake of Peace okay how many love brother Larry holes mes and Amen brother read Gabriels Gabriel amen they are my eternal Brothers amen amen I believe you are an eternal Church okay amen now I I read you notice for the End of Time message this meaning the seventh he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say it say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible and remember Revelation 1017 is that I'm less stick to Revelation 8 at the end of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God would be known at the end we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal it ends the time of all things amen amen amen now if you read this Revelation chapter 8 verse1 ver one it says the brothers will help there our brother he will be all right if you read Revelation chapter 8 it tells you that and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour all right now this seventh seal uh when it is open not when it is preached the people have been waiting for a preaching on this subject but this one was not preached but was open now that's why the people are saying it is not revealed because they were waiting for for it to be preached but the Bible don't tell us about the preaching it tells us about the opening so we were rather waiting for it to be open not to be preached because this is the end of the seventh Angel's message amen amen now this ministry speaks about the opening not the preaching that's why we'll continue to look into it it is the closing and this one is the end of all things this seventh it says the seventh SE the end of all okay amen now you know we look at the the seventh the sixth then we realize the Sixth Seal how many remember amen you know the six and the Seven speaks about men people because the six is Moses and Elijah on the other side of the Rapture Moses and Elijah will come with that as we are going to look into this again the Gentiles the time of the Gentiles is over and what happens then amen amen where are we now we looking at the ministry that that is opened am while the people are waiting for the preaching now instead the Lord opened to his bride amen amen amen now preaching is a different thing from opening you understand that okay amen that's why when he arrive here it is not preaching now he started to open open open open to the bride is the opening amen amen amen amen you can preach a mystery but you can open the mystery so the Mysteries it doesn't say it is now the preaching of the it is the opening amen you can't preach the seventh seal no it was open and the people are waiting for a preaching but the bride has received because it was opened there's difference between preaching and open that's why it says when he opened it doesn't say when he preached when he opened the seventh SE silence all right amen now let's look at this what actually happened we were looking at this last let me look at this book here and uh talking about the commission now there was the first commission was to pray for the sick but this commission here is about the Angels now the ministry would rage is now change to the second commission the first is just praying for the people and so for but the second is Angels okay amen as we read this part last when the prophet said I was still looking West toward now if you look into your Bible men the men was put Eastward didn't it say so the Book of Genesis man was put Eastward that's the garden and what was in the west because you come sometimes to where it says we will read it it is there East and West Has Come Together amen the connection of the Angel was with with an angel connection with an angel amen amen that's when he was amen he was connected to the two which side he says I went W to connect with an angel and he says the Angels were coming from the West because men Adam was placed all right am now that's why now if you go west now you'll miss the whole thing he said then I return I went that's why the Bible says the Lord shall come [Music] from East and a man was placed East then I read here it says the end of the seventh Angel's [Music] message no the end of the seventh Angel message at the end of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God would be known amen say this amen is passed and it says at that end of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God would be known all right amen so some people while some people are still striving to have the seventh seal opened you will realize that there is the bread of Christ she's not waiting for the seven seal to be revealed because at the end of the ministry of the message of the seventh angel message all Mysteries including the seventh revealed you know in the whole Ministry God has left this part for himself and the and his amen just as you we have seen here the bridegroom and the bride amen amen the only the two special service for the two now after because was sent only not any other woman they remain it is not revealed it is not this Rebecca received a special message from Abraham amen amen so now this special Rebecca receiving from the husband Christ himself we've never heard Rebecca say you know H who's rea's husband is Isaac Isaac doesn't want to tell me some something he's hiding from me some other things another woman can could say that notc all was revealed to Rebecca she was not just a wife she was a special amen and coming down she knew that everything was revealed that the last thing for her was to meet ISAC coming on until she could see Isaac amen amen and the messenger who are sent by Abraham himself L Rebecca to ISAC but you look at Rebecca she remained on the camera until she could see is just as the Bride of today she remained on the k until she could see the husband that's why we are separated from other things we are not confused amen and when she saw Isaac then she said who is that who is coming amen I think with the bride of Christ she also has come to that place where she could see her ISAC and and can say is this amen amen no other woman could ask that question is this coming even today it is the wife who can say who is this coming amen because she managed to see him amen all right amen I read this part he revealed all the six seals but say nothing about the seventh even today no other woman could talk about Isaac but only rebec amen amen no other woman can see the seven SE only the [Music] [Applause] bride amen when Rebecca is then went out his ministry let Rea to that place where she could see Isaac you know this let the bride until she could see the king of Sal amen amen the coming city right amen shall I read amen yeah amen that's why as I Isaac could reveal all because the seven it's only for Rebecca am if somebody's getting married the secret of maybe his love or her love their love it's only known to them amen amen the love of the Bride to Christ is very special amen you know knew something AB Samson all right amen Samson Samson don't worry brother don't worry when we come together the Bible says Satan also came but since he was defeated don't worry about it he's a defeated Satan you know you are defeated and we are here to worship all right amen sometimes we hear them talking we want that one we want that one this and that amen and I was reading all righten let's leave them alone their time is [Applause] finished let's worship our God wonderful I read for the end of time now for the end of time this seal that is the seventh I'm I'm going to read something here as we are going through this um the seal when it starts will will be absolutely a total secret now when you are talking about secret you are talking a secret is between the husband and the wife if if Isaac is receives a secret all right am you see already we've got the thing he's getting attacked from home at by Matthew and don't worry we've got [Applause] triing Matthew mat and AOS a that's right after the service we will send and see the end of the seventh angel message did you hear that the mysteries of God at that end the Myster would be known then it says we are at the end the opening of the Serv the ministry is not towards opening Ministry of the Bride now comes after the opening amen some other women are still struggling they want to see what is inside there but for the bread of Christ it's after now you look at the Seven Seals I read this part listen CH is this say is this the time let me repeat I was still looking West you know that that he would be in the East looking he is in the East looking way off into eternity then he says I saw a constellation of something coming it looked like it might have been little dots it was coming you know he says it was coming from eternity the power of the almighty God lifted me up to meet them you know in this ministry he didn't go to meet them but he was lifted up amen okay amen it won't be your effort it will be it's him amen you will meet him you'll see what he wants you to see he will reveal to you as a wife amen is that right uh I could see this Angels shaped back Wings traveling faster than sound they come from eternity you know I've met we all want to meet some visitors you know when I was told about brother gabri coming the reason I said he is my eternal brother amen amen receiving somebody from eternity it's not like receiving somebody from worshiping with the people from eternity it's not just like men from the regions of this world Amen because these people they come they've got one language when brother gabrion arrived here I realized that he has only one language that's why I said to him you are my [Applause] eternal because I could not hear anything shortcoming he never told me about some people but he spoke my language he spoke about heaven and the message that's all okay amen don't you need such mhm amen we will close right amen now here we are I read this part I could see those angels shake back Wings traving faster than sounds that's how they could travel they come from eternity amen welcome from etern in a split light the twinkling of an eye not enough to bet your eye just a twinkling amen amen and then cre powerful angels I'm following and when it did I was caught up into this pyramid you see that was a pyramid amen I I believe you are not expecting me to say hey quit smoking doing this here is the bread of Christ stop smoking stop doing this stop doing that no there are people from eternity they do not [Music] smoke you won't say to them stop worshiping cell phone our young people today they worship as I'm saying so they worshiping they worship okay amen I say I've got three or two or three of them three of cell phones I don't worship them I use for furthering for the word of God apart from that you won't see me no you'll see me only when I'm calling fing the word of God all right amen but the people of today they worship it let's read this we are still coming you'll see that after the opening of this seventh se you look at the mystery will continue to see it the coming days all right but let's look at this the coming days can only be one day I was caught up in this pyramid for God to deal with Amen to accept you he puts you in a constellation amen because every time he speaks the message is head in the constellation in the constellation you hear God without you hear the preachers have you heard that why the constellation because we have we had that message last time the constellation to come in the constellation if God is going to continually speak to you he will put you in a con amen because in the constellation you don't have interpreters the way that is given to you is interpreted already everywh that God Amen sent to us it is already interpreted that's why we just say [Applause] Amen few minutes yet I could now those angels it's a pyramid of the Angels amen now this seventh angel messenger could not operate without he has to be put in the constellation the pyramid because this message is for the Insiders not the people that are residing outside I don't need to interpret it the time it arrives said the Bri it already inter am am that's why it will only receive amen amen amen interpreted already when the message reached Rebecca it was already interpreted that's why re didn't ask for the photo of Isaiah like saying but this you saying ISAC don't you have a photo why when it was for to that's why she just came when they came without firing with questions she knew that she's going to meet the one was prepared for her if you are from God and uh let's say you are a man you find a woman the one that was not prepared for [Music] you you will also understand that yeah because I'll tell you something we'll say we'll talk about it you know what that's why the prophet I was listening to him saying if you don't have a a good wife don't you'll find one hey I said a prophet what are you saying because some people say leave here and get another one but the prophet say don't worry you find the right one it says if you marry your your woman you will still even after this life you still continue as a brother and a sister because it was Adam and Eve he P them just like that amen now if as the prophet if it's not a good one or she's not up to your expectation still you'll get the right one how I won't tell you let us read and when it let me see about the angels I was caught up into the Pyramid of constellation I was numb all over said oh this means that they will be my blast to kill me I am at the end of my road I must not tell my people he thought that he was dying then it came to me while I was in the constellation if it would have killed you have killed Joseph that's what he has said constellation and I could hear J calling me then I turned again and I thought Lord God what does this vision mean I wondered then it came to me not a voice just came to me that is the angels of the Lord that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new not that the old commission my new one that is that amen now let us close with this the end of the seventh Angel's message what do you expect after that tell me after the seventh messenger what do you expect all right am now here I read this P he speaks about the second pool and so forth we'll come to these things but he says he was counting left to right it would have been the seventh angel as he saw them coming coming across amen amen as the he's the seventh messenger then he says h i quote we listen as we continue I will skip to this now oh my God bless you amen the seventh the seventh is not to be known to the public it is known to the one that is in the constellation I hope you will see iten when we come to the constellation that's why you see us worshiping God and even not talking bad about the other people each and everyone should follow and serve God according to the Revelation that's given to amen amen I quote the last quotation because this is the end of the you know when brother Bram was preaching You' think that he won't come to the end well he didn't he did not come to the end but he arrived with Rebecca at a place not the end he could only leave Rebecca after Rebecca has [Music] seen that's why I was saying you can't say let's have brother bam to come to continue if you are the bride Rebecca never said yeah brother see Isaac but I still need you [Music] amen amen like I can say brother I see Christ seven se but I still need then I will just play you tapes now the tape will speak about ISAC now would say to Rebecca I'll remain with you and then remaining with could he proceed to Isaac back to repeating repeating again no Rebecca Rea must proceed amen that's why brother said these young preachers they will take this message up to the End Amen they can't go back again and say brother let's start again no he pointed out he pointed up Isaac and when he did that Rebecca got off the king amen [Applause] what if Rea would remain on the until when even when Isaac says behold com let's continue [Music] huh the message has to bring [Applause] you so when he saw Isaac when she saw and said who's that and he said it's my master said okay now say [Applause] the the Rebecca Rea who has seen [Applause] ISAC and said is this the T so she got off because she has seen ISAC amen she couldn't remain with and Al bowed out he has done the work God took brother at the right God won make mistak and take before time no it is after the wife has seen Isaac now the bride that has seen Isaac today remain on amen amen if you see Rebecca that's remaining on you know that she hasn't seen once she can see Isaac she will get off theing to meet Isaac now this bride today has got of the amen to meet is all right amen when I see him the now okay let me read you this part here will come because last we ended up we you'll see things here after it says when he went I went West we've seen that last week to connect with this Angels message to come back here amen amen yeah am to reveal it to the church he never said to the to the church the church is the body we part of it he came back
