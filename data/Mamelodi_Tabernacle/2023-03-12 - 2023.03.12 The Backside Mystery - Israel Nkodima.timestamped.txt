[20:34] the law which was 430 years after cannot
[20:39] these are not that it should make the

[20:48] is no more of promise but God gave it to
[20:51] Abraham by promise wherefore then
[20:55] seventh the law if it was added because
[21:00] of transgressions till the seed should

[25:14] we I think we arrived
[25:18] as we look into the
[25:21] subject by the prophets
[25:30] uh sometimes that's why we repeat these
[25:33] things
[25:34] [Music]
[25:40] something in him
[25:49] amen amen now what is that something now
[25:53] system say King

[46:20] that's why
[46:30] because it is
[46:33] if you join you join somebody else thing
[46:36] I mean yes
[46:49] I was well I think there's some sisters
[46:53] baptized last weekend
[46:56] if it serves me well
[47:01] um
[47:04] uh just during the week they arrived at
[47:07] my house
[47:10] I think they
[47:13] they have arranged with Barbies but
[47:18] arranging the discussion
[47:21] and

[47:25] arrived back

[48:32] you say Amen
[48:34] if you are called of God
[48:37] you'll do such things
