[48:02] um we are the children of
[48:06] God and being the children of
[48:10] God when something like this has
[48:16] happen is our time
[48:20] to tell one
[48:25] another uh our
[48:30] hope because living
[48:35] here this place is not our
[48:40] home we have got a
[48:44] home then um my
[48:48] topic is going to be destination of
[48:52] three people of one
[49:06] three people of one
[49:11] oh amen three people of one amen during
[49:19] death ah you may wonder what is
[49:23] happening here
[49:29] um we are going to
[49:33] die the Bible says we
[49:37] know that we are going to
[49:40] die but what do we don't
[49:45] know
[49:47] is when are we going to
[49:51] die but dying we know
[49:58] I also
[50:01] know but I don't know
[50:04] when and another question is that I
[50:07] don't know
[50:11] how I don't know whether I'm going to
[50:13] die through
[50:17] illness or I'm going to die through
[50:22] accident or I'm going to be killed
[50:29] but I'm going to
[50:32] die amen when you are
[50:35] killed that this your time to
[50:39] [Music]
[50:41] die because we cannot stop
[50:46] death no ways we cannot stop
[50:52] death the Bible
[50:54] says there is time to be
[50:58] born and there is time to
[51:02] die that is what God has
[51:05] said and if God has said something like
[51:10] that it will be just like
[51:15] thaten
[51:16] death has got no
[51:20] [Music]
[51:22] reason you cannot say he died because he
[51:26] he he he didn't use
[51:33] medication he use medication and
[51:40] die you cannot say he di because he
[51:43] didn't go he didn't have a medical
[51:49] Aid if he would have Medical Aid you
[51:52] would have gone to better doctors
[51:59] they die
[52:03] there in other words death has no
[52:09] reason some may
[52:11] say he died because he was not training
[52:15] or
[52:22] jiming but I've seen people playing
[52:25] football
[52:28] they pass him
[52:32] ball they gave him the ball they gave
[52:36] him the
[52:38] ball when he tried to drop the
[52:41] ball fell down and
[52:46] dead but he was from a
[52:51] training someone was running a
[52:55] Maron when they were
[52:58] running he fell down and
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:02] died death is no
[53:05] reason amen you cannot say he died
[53:11] because he was
[53:13] old no no
[53:15] no death is no
[53:18] reason death is no
[53:23] age you cannot
[53:28] kill
[53:30] death you cannot stop
[53:34] death the Bible
[53:37] says our days are in his
[53:43] hand he has given us the end of our
[53:51] days and we cannot skip that
[53:56] in other words when your time has
[54:00] come you will
[54:04] die like
[54:08] [Applause]
[54:11] not
[54:14] poor
[54:16] foolish
[54:19] clever
[54:21] wies
[54:23] doctors all will die
[54:31] the Bible says
[54:33] here let me read something here before I
[54:36] go
[54:39] on death has no
[54:45] reason read my brother read Psalm
[54:52] 499 verse 10 to 14 ver 10
[54:57] 14 just read
[55:14] there9 for he said that
[55:17] wise like wise the and the brtish person
[55:22] perish and leave their wealth to others
[55:26] their inward thought is that their
[55:29] houses shall continue forever and their
[55:32] ding places to all generations they call
[55:36] their lands after their own names
[55:38] nevertheless man being in honor abideth
[55:42] not he is like the Beast that
[55:46] perish this their way is their fall yet
[55:52] their posterity approve their
[55:57] are you reading Psalm 49
[56:02] yes it says um what I want this 19
[56:10] here he shall go to the generation of
[56:13] his
[56:19] [Music]
[56:20] fathers they shall never see light
[56:28] in other
[56:30] words there are
[56:33] people when they
[56:36] die each and everyone
[56:39] here when he die he goes to his
[56:47] generation if if you are not born
[56:51] again you go to those who are not born
[56:54] again
[56:57] if you are born
[56:59] again you go to those who are born
[57:03] again they say the Bible is talking
[57:05] about those who are not born
[57:09] again he says when they
[57:12] die they go to their
[57:14] [Music]
[57:15] generation and their generation is the
[57:18] generation that don't
[57:24] see amen
[57:28] that is the
[57:31] generation but let me say something
[57:34] here The Bible says in the book of
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] Corinthians it says
[57:45] um though the inward the outward man
[57:50] perishes
[57:56] amen but the inward man is renewed
[58:05] daily and Paul is talking about two
[58:10] here in
[58:12] one he says there is an inward
[58:17] man there is an outward
[58:20] Man by the in the outside
[58:24] man perishes
[58:28] he gets old and
[58:31] perish that is what has happened
[58:34] here but he says the inward
[58:40] what is renewed
[58:45] daily so that is the reason we need to
[58:48] prepare
[58:51] ourselves then when we go
[58:54] on we read again Paul says the book of
[59:01] Colossians it's talking about putting on
[59:04] an on a new
[59:09] man he says put put away an old
[59:15] man and put on a new
[59:21] man
[59:24] now men m
[59:27] Paul is talking about
[59:30] here when we read the book of Matthew
[59:34] here Jesus
[59:36] says Don't Fear the one who can kill the
[59:43] flesh but who failed to kill the
[59:50] soul you must fear the one who kills the
[59:54] Flesh and the soul
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:01] Paul Jesus says there is an outward
[1:00:07] man and there is an inward
[1:00:10] man and Jesus called the inward Man
[1:00:19] soul Paul
[1:00:21] says talking about the soul
[1:00:26] says there is an old
[1:00:30] soul and there is a New
[1:00:33] Soul he says you put away the old
[1:00:39] one and put the new
[1:00:42] one then when I was saying three people
[1:00:47] in
[1:00:51] one I was talking about flesh
[1:00:57] the the old the old
[1:01:01] soul and the new
[1:01:07] Soul
[1:01:09] flesh the old
[1:01:12] soul and the new
[1:01:15] soul that is
[1:01:18] three this all this
[1:01:20] people they've got their destination
[1:01:26] and when they go to their
[1:01:29] destination they go through
[1:01:34] stations but according to the
[1:01:37] Bible there is only one man
[1:01:41] here are you together with
[1:01:44] me I say there is
[1:01:47] flesh and old
[1:01:50] soul and then the new
[1:01:54] Soul as we are in
[1:01:57] here some of
[1:01:59] you
[1:02:02] they some of you they've got the
[1:02:06] new but all of us we have got
[1:02:11] flesh are you together we juster
[1:02:17] inside because inside some are still
[1:02:20] wearing the old so
[1:02:26] some are wearing the
[1:02:30] new and there is a there is the
[1:02:33] difference of
[1:02:37] destination but the
[1:02:40] flesh got only one
[1:02:43] destination and his destination is the
[1:02:50] grave All
[1:02:53] Flesh the end of it is the
[1:02:58] gra there is no other place for
[1:03:03] it is the
[1:03:05] grave then we have got two
[1:03:09] here The Old
[1:03:11] Man and the new
[1:03:13] man then the new the old
[1:03:17] man has
[1:03:18] got two
[1:03:23] stations the first station
[1:03:26] station he has got two station after
[1:03:32] death because after bir you still have
[1:03:35] to
[1:03:40] move after death the first the man the
[1:03:45] old
[1:03:46] man has got two
[1:03:49] stations before he reaches his
[1:03:51] destination
[1:03:55] are you together with
[1:03:58] me the first station
[1:04:01] station is the sixth
[1:04:05] Dimension The Fifth
[1:04:08] Dimension
[1:04:13] the you see we have got the the
[1:04:18] hates and you have
[1:04:21] got we have
[1:04:24] got you see
[1:04:28] aase is the bottomless
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:33] pit even demons fear
[1:04:39] a because when Jesus was about to drive
[1:04:43] them away from that that man that man
[1:04:51] there demon said don't drive us to our
[1:04:55] base
[1:04:59] D us into those
[1:05:02] Peaks because when you go
[1:05:06] down there are three places
[1:05:11] there the base is the
[1:05:18] last it's a bottomless
[1:05:22] pit The Fifth Dimension dimension
[1:05:26] which I called the
[1:05:28] sh because these people who studies the
[1:05:36] Bible they say the sh is the place where
[1:05:40] death weigh there for
[1:05:49] judgment but sometimes they say is GRA
[1:05:56] but we have got where the de
[1:06:03] Waits who are not
[1:06:06] saved and we got the second
[1:06:10] one is where demons
[1:06:14] dwell then you have got the third
[1:06:17] one is
[1:06:19] Hell
[1:06:21] before after death after hell bottomless
[1:06:25] feet
[1:06:27] that is where the Beast come
[1:06:33] from that is where devil come
[1:06:37] from because he has got many
[1:06:41] names is called
[1:06:44] Lucifer
[1:06:46] called
[1:06:49] called that is the name of
[1:06:53] Satan when they were saying Jesus
[1:06:57] was there were many he was
[1:07:01] Satan because is the king of
[1:07:08] demons and Satan is the
[1:07:13] king and we know demons are Fallen
[1:07:21] Spirits they are the ones who believe
[1:07:23] Devil's lie in heaven okay
[1:07:28] they believe the devil's
[1:07:33] Li they believe the devil's
[1:07:40] lie in
[1:07:43] heaven here there are
[1:07:47] many there are ministers of
[1:07:52] sat some are liars
[1:07:58] is a
[1:07:59] demon is a
[1:08:02] demon pride is a
[1:08:06] demon there are
[1:08:09] many but they they can't work if they
[1:08:12] don't find a a flesh to work
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:21] in this this old man
[1:08:26] I say his first station is The Fifth
[1:08:35] Dimension and then the other
[1:08:38] one the second station this
[1:08:43] man is the way through
[1:08:48] judgment the Bible says books were
[1:08:53] opened and men were judg
[1:08:56] to what was written in the
[1:09:03] books when I'm standing here
[1:09:06] preaching I'm preaching to
[1:09:10] you I'm preaching to
[1:09:18] you either you are an old
[1:09:22] soul now I'm telling you you are
[1:09:24] destination
[1:09:29] or after
[1:09:31] death know that you are going to The
[1:09:33] Fifth
[1:09:36] Dimension then from The Fifth
[1:09:39] Dimension you are going to the W
[1:09:44] judgment are going to be judged
[1:09:50] there Bible says the books were open
[1:09:55] and when people are judged there Sor
[1:09:58] when people are judged
[1:10:02] there the Bible says there were some who
[1:10:05] came
[1:10:07] there because books were
[1:10:11] open they came with their good
[1:10:15] works they say we we were praying for
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:21] sick and they go healed we proph
[1:10:29] Jesus said I don't know
[1:10:34] you a born
[1:10:37] man is a new soul the soul which is Born
[1:10:44] Again is a new
[1:10:46] soul the soul which is not born
[1:10:50] again is
[1:10:52] the because
[1:10:55] to be born
[1:10:57] again you are born again through the
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] seat if you are a New
[1:11:08] Soul you are a daughter and a son of
[1:11:15] God and you can be a daughter and a son
[1:11:18] of
[1:11:20] God if you are not his SE
[1:11:26] in other way you were born through his
[1:11:35] seat my son is my
[1:11:39] seat and if you are the son of what you
[1:11:41] are his
[1:11:45] seat you were his seat from the
[1:11:52] beginning but through birth
[1:11:56] you became
[1:11:59] dirty then the Bible
[1:12:04] says he forew you before the foundation
[1:12:07] of the
[1:12:10] world those who he
[1:12:13] forew he did
[1:12:16] predestinate to be
[1:12:19] conformed to the image of his
[1:12:23] son in another always to be the word of
[1:12:28] God it transforms
[1:12:32] you from the Son and the daughter of the
[1:12:39] world to be the Son and the daughter of
[1:12:45] God you receive the
[1:12:49] word because the weight is a
[1:12:53] seat and the seat travels through the
[1:12:58] body and from the body to the
[1:13:02] body that's why the seed moved through
[1:13:09] Philip to the
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:12] UN so that birth can be can OCC
[1:13:18] there but
[1:13:21] by you are a sinner
[1:13:25] you should have come at the
[1:13:28] right place the right
[1:13:32] way but just because of
[1:13:36] birth this birth was was in was
[1:13:39] introduced by Satan
[1:13:43] here and he he defiled the
[1:13:48] field because the the wom of a woman is
[1:13:52] a fi
[1:13:55] amen then seeds are brought out of
[1:14:01] that there
[1:14:03] are bad seat and good
[1:14:08] seats because from
[1:14:13] one which is
[1:14:15] Eve came out a
[1:14:20] and from one field
[1:14:26] amen a certain man had a
[1:14:30] problem of the seed moving
[1:14:34] through the
[1:14:39] ark this serent
[1:14:44] seat he said it moves through the ark
[1:14:47] through by
[1:14:53] H I said
[1:14:56] I
[1:14:57] said the seat SE
[1:15:01] seat it can come
[1:15:04] through a good
[1:15:10] family just from from Isaac and
[1:15:18] Rebecca from Isaac re came Esau and
[1:15:22] Jacob
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:28] and Es was the son of the
[1:15:33] devil he was the seat of the
[1:15:37] serpent serpent seat can come from
[1:15:42] anywhere the
[1:15:44] Pharisees were
[1:15:47] the because Jesus said you come from
[1:15:52] below I come from above
[1:15:55] he said to them your father is the
[1:16:00] devil then that is the S
[1:16:03] seat that is how it comes
[1:16:06] here it has fallen from
[1:16:10] Heaven they believe the lie of Satan
[1:16:14] there they still believing the LIE of
[1:16:20] Satan we have got many people
[1:16:23] here they say they
[1:16:28] believe but only to find that they are
[1:16:32] not believing the
[1:16:34] message the way they should
[1:16:38] believe you must
[1:16:41] know we have got M Mount
[1:16:45] camel
[1:16:50] Showdown and we have got M
[1:16:52] Transfiguration show down
[1:16:57] Transfiguration and we still going to
[1:16:59] have another one the third
[1:17:02] one is the m
[1:17:05] Zion Zion show
[1:17:09] down we are we we all have placed our
[1:17:17] sacrifices we shall
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:22] see but you know yourself
[1:17:28] this
[1:17:30] second this third
[1:17:33] man because I said I I said the second
[1:17:38] man the second station is the way
[1:17:40] through
[1:17:45] judgment and then
[1:17:48] where after that he his destination is
[1:17:52] the Lego of Fire
[1:17:57] that is his
[1:18:01] destination you must know your
[1:18:06] destination then we have got the set
[1:18:11] man which is the new
[1:18:15] Soul this that
[1:18:18] man I
[1:18:20] said they are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:29] we said they are written in the LMS Book
[1:18:33] of
[1:18:37] Life we said They
[1:18:40] are
[1:18:44] Kings we said they
[1:18:48] are the
[1:18:51] bride we said they are the
[1:18:57] rulers we said they are
[1:19:04] Judges that's what the Bible
[1:19:07] says you cannot take
[1:19:10] small small cases to the
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:17] magistrate why don't you take to the
[1:19:19] people who are given the PO to judge
[1:19:27] just like
[1:19:31] me I'm given the power to
[1:19:35] judge I am a
[1:19:40] judge I'm starting here to judge
[1:19:46] you I'm studing I'm busy
[1:19:50] judging when I'm preaching your heart
[1:19:53] tells you
[1:19:57] where you
[1:20:01] are when you when you ha
[1:20:10] them you are you your your name is taken
[1:20:14] out of the Book of
[1:20:21] Life The Book of Life is the system of
[1:20:28] life in other words when you talk
[1:20:31] about the
[1:20:34] weight is the system of
[1:20:38] life then when you say you are in the
[1:20:44] weight but you hate somebody in the
[1:20:50] weight then you get out of the way
[1:20:55] in other words you are no more in the
[1:21:01] system but when on that
[1:21:04] day on that
[1:21:06] day you will say I received a message in
[1:21:14] 1974 they say yes you are there in the
[1:21:18] book but your name was
[1:21:23] removed because of you are
[1:21:27] hatred you can hear a person in the
[1:21:32] message saying I I I hate
[1:21:38] somebody I don't even want to be where
[1:21:40] he
[1:21:43] is but saying he is in the
[1:21:48] message the Bible says if you don't love
[1:21:52] me as your brother
[1:21:56] love me as your
[1:21:59] enemy in other words you don't have the
[1:22:02] right to
[1:22:06] hate if you hate you are from the
[1:22:12] devil in other words you are you are
[1:22:17] there is a demon the demon which
[1:22:20] incarnated itself in you

[1:22:44] blessed blessed I will be
[1:22:48] blessed
[1:22:50] okay amen blessed I will be blessed
[1:22:56] but that doesn't mean I am the child of
[1:23:04] God I can't be the child of God with
[1:23:07] that little
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:12] hatred but people say but he he's a
[1:23:15] blessing to
[1:23:19] us that doesn't mean nothing
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:27] in Matthew chter 25 he

[1:25:11] nearer to
[1:25:15] Heaven
[1:25:17] amen their first station
[1:25:22] station when they when they they

[1:25:36] group I say I
[1:25:39] believe I don't say I don't say he
[1:25:42] is I don't say she is I say I believe
[1:25:46] she

[1:25:55] message I found them
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:01] there and he even died in the message he
[1:26:06] even lived the Earth while he was in the
[1:26:14] message because the
[1:26:16] message when we say New
[1:26:22] Birth there is no no
[1:26:25] bth without a
[1:26:30] seat and the Bible
[1:26:33] says those who call upon the name of the
[1:26:38] Lord they shall be
[1:26:41] safe amen he said how can they call upon
[1:26:46] it if they don't know
[1:26:51] it he said how can how can they
[1:26:55] preach about
[1:26:58] it if they are not
[1:27:03] sent and each and every
[1:27:07] time God has a man
[1:27:12] there God has a voice
[1:27:16] there and those who hear God's voice at
[1:27:19] the
[1:27:21] time from that man
[1:27:25] just like during Moses
[1:27:27] time those who had
[1:27:30] Moses they had another
[1:27:34] Spirit those who didn't have another
[1:27:37] Spirit they couldn't hear
[1:27:43] Moses but those who have had
[1:27:47] him they had
[1:27:52] God during each
[1:27:55] AG God had a messenger
[1:27:59] there and God had
[1:28:04] predestinated under that Min
[1:28:08] messenger there were pastors
[1:28:12] there they were predestinated to be
[1:28:17] there they are pred to be
[1:28:21] there under that
[1:28:25] messenger and there are deons there are
[1:28:30] sheep there is no sheep without the
[1:28:35] shepher Sheep without the shepherd is a
[1:28:37] lost
[1:28:44] sheep there is no
[1:28:47] shepher Shepherd is
[1:28:51] Jesus then when we identify Jesus in a
[1:28:57] man then we say this one is a
[1:29:04] Shepherd then the ship will follow
[1:29:07] the because the voice of
[1:29:10] God comes from the teaching and the
[1:29:18] preaching each
[1:29:21] Messengers has a voice of God
[1:29:25] that's why the prophet says I am a voice
[1:29:27] of God to
[1:29:34] you of to
[1:29:38] me I am the voice of God to
[1:29:43] you
[1:29:46] amen that's why they said before the
[1:29:50] throne there were voices there
[1:29:56] those voices were voices of
[1:30:01] preachers preachers who were under those
[1:30:08] Messengers those
[1:30:11] voices they are there judging
[1:30:16] people I
[1:30:19] said Those whom he forew
[1:30:25] he he did predestinate to be
[1:30:34] conformed to be like his first to be
[1:30:37] like his first
[1:30:40] born so that he must have
[1:30:47] his so those who are new Souls
[1:30:55] they are his
[1:30:58] Brethren the Bible says Paul says in
[1:31:01] Hebrews
[1:31:03] chapter he says both the
[1:31:08] stif and those who he
[1:31:12] sanctifies they are from one
[1:31:17] person that's why he's not ashamed to
[1:31:19] call them brethren
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:27] amen how can his Brethren be
[1:31:35] lost you cannot be
[1:31:38] lost if you are
[1:31:43] his to be
[1:31:47] his God gives you an eye
[1:31:54] to identify your
[1:31:57] age to identify your
[1:32:02] message because the message of your
[1:32:07] hour that is what is
[1:32:12] important
[1:32:14] amen he gives you an
[1:32:17] eye then you that's why he gave
[1:32:22] Nathaniel And I
[1:32:25] so then Daniel said Thou Art the Son of
[1:32:31] God the king of
[1:32:34] Israel he had that
[1:32:37] eye he given that woman
[1:32:41] an when the phes says you are we
[1:32:46] are he said thou the
[1:32:50] prophet he predestinated you
[1:32:54] he predestinated
[1:32:56] you to be
[1:32:59] conformed that that that conforming is
[1:33:03] in
[1:33:04] you because each
[1:33:07] seat in it there is that
[1:33:10] power that power to to Quicken
[1:33:14] it because God has placed that power in
[1:33:18] that
[1:33:20] seat he said Let each seat
[1:33:25] produce according to his
[1:33:30] kind we being the
[1:33:32] seat we have got that quickening
[1:33:36] power that quickening power can Quicken
[1:33:41] us and that quick power is from these
[1:33:49] way
[1:33:51] amen the first station
[1:33:55] their first station after
