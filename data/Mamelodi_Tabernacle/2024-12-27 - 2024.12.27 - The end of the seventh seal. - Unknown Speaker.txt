he is revealed he is his church isn't it wonderful and you see and expressed by the word itself that he is God okay now I'm going to read and God will help me he going to just be a short message but but that can keep you eternity amen amen here is the part I want to we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things which seal the seven and I've heard some people are still waiting for the seven SE to be [Music] revealed now it says here we must remember that this seventh SE is the end of time of all things amen amen yes sir then it continues this is Page 501 from my seals book the end of the seventh seal then I it continues the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation okay amen and it continues the seventh SE because the title is the end of the seven seal I read it from this very same book um of of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world before the [Music] foundation amen and it ends every bit it is the end it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is the end of the struggling nature is the end of everything this seventh is the end of all things you know to to those who have received the seventh SE they have received the end of all things the bride of Christ is not waiting for the seventh SE because it was revealed okay amen is the end Fair now it says uh it ends everything the seventh seal are you waiting for the seventh SE no I am not waiting for the because already God revealed it not to everybody but to the bride of Christ to his wife he can't keep his wife without the seventh seal if you saying it is not revealed you are not his wife okay amen it was revealed okay amen now I read this part uh sorry for being so slow it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is the end of the struggling nature is the end of everything I could you know even nature is strling yes but the healing of the struggling nature amen is the seventh SE the healing my healing is the seventh seal amen since it was revealed to me I'm Healed [Applause] am I'm not struggling no every day I'm calling upon [Music] him come Lord Jesus uh I even every day I'm talking to him just like you [Applause] here that's why I love this here even so [Music] it it's a scripture even so come Lord Jesus you cannot invite him unless you are part of him I understand somewhere this song was been even so come the spirit of the and the bride say come the bride is calling upon to [Applause] come I don't know how many here are calling upon him saying come how many are here come Jesus Christ why you calling upon him it is because you are part you are part of him he is your life he is the author of your life and he is so much in your heart until you say come Lord Jesus I don't know how many will UT this word every day come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus and he's coming I was listening when some people they were trying to talk about his coming but yet so discouraged the same people who were talking about him they were discouraged by the fact that inside of this people there is no coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but the Bible says the spirit and the right say come why because only part of him can say Lord Jesus um some are from but that is not your original you are from heaven now there's that Supernatural nature in you because you know you are not of this world that's why there's a spirit in you calling saying come Lord Jesus all right amen if you don't have that spirit in you saying come Lord Jesus Christ then I will read you something here because here he says seventh seal is the end is the end am is the end of time of all things you don't need to be a church order a a a a church [Music] go no you are a Church of Christ you yourself Church go and the Church of CH church is different things they are church members they are not part of him church goers a church goer is somebody who comes to church but yet he is not part of him because a part of him has that in his heart he is in the heart of his wife all right amen now let me read this I think I'm talking to an individual okay amen somebody who has life inside of him and this life is the Life of Christ it is a Dwelling Place you brother you sister you are a Dwelling Place of the almighty God I don't know if you know that your life something a big will turning in your heart amen amen because brother Brenham says he speaks of the thir thr he says the first Throne was in heaven the second thr was in Jesus the third thr is in amen now this ministry is the third Throne [Applause] Ministry how many have heard brother saying that the third Throne now this ministry is the ministry of the third Throne amen okay amen let me read I'm just talking to an individual he continues to say the seventh SE is the end of time of all things are you listening some people are still struggling to recognize the seventh se but he says the seventh seal is the end of all things and it is in the third Throne okay amen I read uh the the seventh seal is the end of all things the things written in the seven sealed book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world is the end of the struggling nature is the end of of everything it is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vience is the end of the of the earth it's even the end of time you know the prophet of God he Express so much to me about the seven seal as the End Amen okay amen now before I close the end of the seventh it is even the end of the seventh everything runs out in this time at the end of this seventh SE is it revealed to you okay amen notice it is the end of the church it's is still brother told is the end of the church is the end the end of the seven seal is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vi vs even the end the ushering in of the [Music] Millennium that's on the the seven amen amen I was looking also at something here because it is the end all right amen then he continues is the end of the seven SE the end of the church age that's why we are no longer talking about the church age because the seventh seal is the end of the Church age what we are waiting for now is to be summoned up because everything has ended the seven seal has ended all things amen amen amen it's not something you can pray for Lord open to me the seventh seal there there are things you can't pray for amen amen but they are there from eternity so you can't pray for them you are part of these things that we are going to code here is that right you know what brought us together here it happened way back do you know that it's not our first time to meet here we have met before all right amen but God decided to put us in this bodies this is not our bodies we have our bodies but God for us to dwell here for a while he has put us in this do you know that that body is not your body you are going to your body but you are now not in your body is the body of flesh but your body you know where is your body all right I quote a bit what what puts me in this thing is that it is the end of the seven SE itself then the end of the seven o o of the seven church I'm trying to say you should not that everything you you you you are engaged in is the end of that thing you are getting engaged in something that is that has come to the end my body is the end of my body because the heart in your body cannot have the senses like the senses of the bride of Christ the bride of Christ has the sense of of Christ what is in you is nothing else but Christ Christ amen Christ Christ is an eternal sense in me that is Christ I'm not thinking of any other thing me and you we are thinking of Christ what makes us to think like Christ it is because we are in him and he is in us now our thoughts are that of Christ I think you to you have the thoughts of Christ in you amen amen amen you know him and what makes you to look for him every day thinking of him it is because he is in you now if he is in you your s your senses are that are Eternal did you know that if you are a Christian you have an eternal thoughts amen there's somebody in you not of this world amen amen because if you are a Christian if you are the bride of Christ your thoughts should be Eternal how can I put it now it's the brother says it is the end of church age we are beyond the church and being beyond the church ages where it says uh who's that man he was taken up to heaven was that John amen amen and when he was there he saw things that are beond now when we come to a gathering like this we come here but each and every brother and sister has Supernatural senses while you are here you think your thoughts and that of Christ while you are here I'll tell you why I'm saying this is that right yeah we love one another is that so you know when I looked at my brothers from the first day we congregated here the first day we met the first thing to strike my heart was that it has been a long time since I met this brother all right am I mean naturally spiritually I'm with them every day every [Applause] time okay amen now that is the life I the kind of life I live is the end of the trumpets now I'm going don't go there back there is the end of those things people are still trying to study and find about the the seventh seal not the bread of Christ the bread of Christ is not looking for something already God has visited her and everything that the Lord has prepared for you is in you amen I have my brother here from overseas the first time I met you I said this is my eternal brother [Applause] and because he's an eternal brother this is what brought him here to visit his eternal Brothers a brother visited us one time and some people didn't like him he is even now there I think he's still in Australia I don't know but when he arrived back before he went back home I didn't know him but I was SE in my office there after the service he came in and there's a witness here and he stood like this and look right into my house and said you uh I'm going back and but I will return again to be with you so back home where he came from he said to the people I met this brother so referring to me he says I was listening when he started preaching there and I I said this is not just a man and uh we have uh I think if I had I had the thoughts this morning I would have asked the brother to bring this writing he started to say we were together we came from we came from amen amen and what was in my heart accepted his testimony that we came from one place we were together some do have the testimony now when he met me in the office he said you brother I'm going but I'll be back actually the correct word he said I will come back to follow you but me also I said in my heart I will be glad to meet you again to follow you he started by saying today we are not struggling fighting with Satan all right amen meaning that Satan is not our problem you know if you are a a child of God Satan is not your [Applause] problem he becomes your problem if you are not predestinated then Satan is your problem amen amen we have overcome you we are not going to overcome we have overcome all right amen just like the Lord Jesus he said I have overcome the [Music] world not not only one figure Satan but [Applause] have you seen a man who has overcome the world you are more than conquerors there is some conquerors but we are more conquer us do you know that whether you are a brother or a sister in Christ you are more than a [Applause] conqueror amen I thank God for that I'm not struggling to leave no it is Satan who is struggling a son of God is Not struggling to live right no he is a son he is living because he is a son he is not struggling to live a holy life because the holy life is in him [Applause] beautiful let me read to you then before I close in did you hear that it is the end of everything it is the end of I I could the end of the church age now you must remember that the bride of Christ right now is not in the church age is not residing in a church age they are beyond that have you seen today how many churches now some callings the ENT Ministry what what Ministry but I'm I'm saying to you the real church is the bride of Christ amen amen amen they are not Ling to live a holy life no the holy life is in them because if it is not in you you are struggling but if it is in you is the holy life life the holy life living in you amen amen right amen I'm reading uh think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon the Earth Jesus and the Holy Blood you know brother bam spoke of this he's my Prophet that Mary when he was expect what happened the angel who was that angel amen amen amen he spoke to Mary then my Prophet says the words that Gabriel spoke to Mary they became blood in Mary amen amen amen the ministry the message that was preached to us he didn't just be he didn't just be an A A what you call now a gospel it became blood in us this blood is the word of God but when he spoke it became blood in US that's why it says you are born of the blood of Christ I'm trying to say uh to tell the nature to tell you about the nature of God in us amen mhm amen God didn't give us Commandments we the bride he gave us nature the super nature is that right and the the way that Christ spoke to us is his blood you understand what I'm saying when he he spoke to Mary brother Bram says the message he gave to Mary came blood in Mary so the word of God to you is blood it becomes blood in you all right amen it's not just a message I know it is blood that's why we say the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ saved us from sin a person saved of the blood of Jesus Christ cannot if somebody goes living a contrary life we know that there's no blood in this body the blood of Jesus Christ is the Revelation the life and you can't sin amen they that sin have never seen God because if you have the blood of Jesus Christ you can you are not holding yourself in order not to do something wrong no you are that life [Applause] is that right amen if God was going to give us more time and uh we were going as we are going back to our natural homes and if if his blood his spirit is in us from here we are going to our natural although we are not natural we and arriving at our natural homes we will still be thinking of coming back [Applause] here all right amen now in in in closes I have chosen this so that I cannot go far uh the Holy Ghost descending upon the Earth Jesus that Holy Blood the Jesus you worship is Holy Blood he is Holy Blood okay amen now watch I hope I don't go too deep for you uh this is future home the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God you see God made in creation he was a spirit the Bible said he is the beginning of the creation I I I believe this what I'm reading here is dropping into your he is the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin in the womb of a woman which is what the woman you know these things amen all right in the woman of in the womb of that woman the life that God dropped in there his own blood into that woman produce the Lord not produce him but he came in order to be born as a Son of God in that woman what dropped in that woman was the W but that W was blood in Mary that's why we see Jesus Christ amen your mama she she was expectant I I don't know you know me and school we were far apart me and school we were far apart it's only by God's grace that I can talk a bit all right but when that weight dropped in Mary brother says that way became became what blood okay amen right now including H I read yes it said that that blood amen became amen amen amen all right amen
