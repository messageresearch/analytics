[26:10] Believers it's it's one
[26:13] of uh us that has
[26:19] departed I'm sure you are all aware that
[26:23] it's departing time now
[26:28] we are it's a type
[26:31] now you know that the the the natural
[26:36] type the the
[26:40] spiritual it's almost a month
[26:44] every every uh week we uh have a uh
[26:50] somebody to
[26:57] BU I'm sure you are with
[27:00] us okay I've got some problems
[27:05] here
[27:10] ohen
[27:13] oh all right sorry know the sisters were
[27:16] not stable possibly they were seeing a
[27:21] snake now now we have taken care of it
[27:24] you can relax
[27:26] now yeah
[27:29] brother Harvest has got it is in his
[27:31] pocket
[27:34] now I was wondering why what are they
[27:37] pointing
[27:44] down all right fine now relax the snake
[27:47] is
[27:50] dead all right what what I was
[27:54] saying is
[27:56] that the the
[27:59] the the
[28:02] natural types the
[28:05] spiritual now we are living at the end
[28:10] time we have the message of the
[28:14] hour which is the end time
[28:19] ministry which is
[28:22] we which has to
[28:25] do with the bride himself
[28:30] and then the opening of the weight
[28:34] itself now after the word has been
[28:38] opened
[28:39] and and
[28:42] revealed there's nothing be beyond
[28:46] that in other words
[28:49] now after the end of this
[28:55] Century or after the end of this
[29:00] dispensation is uh the dispensation of
[29:03] the
[29:06] Gentiles then actually we it's now at
[29:10] the end we are entering now
[29:14] uh another
[29:19] life and which is another
[29:23] dispensation of the ministry of angels
[29:29] we are entering into eternity
[29:32] right the time and the signs are
[29:36] telling that we are entering another
[29:41] dispensation now the dispensation that
[29:44] we are in
[29:46] it has to do with the son of
[29:51] man and then and the
[29:55] manifestations of the sons of God
[29:59] I hope you understand what
[30:02] I'm now here our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:07] says
[30:09] therefore uh does my father love
[30:15] me because I laid down my
[30:21] life I lay down my
[30:26] life that I might take it
[30:30] again uh what what does your Bible
[30:41] say okay but I wanted this way it says I
[30:46] lay down my
[30:50] life do you understand amen that I might
[30:54] take it
[30:56] again that's what I want to talk about
[30:58] that will be my
[31:00] title now Jesus Christ said I laid down
[31:04] my
[31:06] life so that I must come again and pick
[31:09] it
[31:12] up and
[31:15] then in the book of
[31:19] Timothy you don't have to read it
[31:21] because it's late we just going to be
[31:24] a in chapter 3 verse one
[31:28] the the Bible
[31:31] says this know also that in the last
[31:37] days dangerous and hazardous time shall
[31:43] come then in verse 5 it
[31:46] says it's speaking about the people that
[31:49] will be living during this
[31:53] time and then he says uh there will be
[31:58] having a form of
[32:01] godliness but denying the power
[32:05] thereof now the power is what we call
[32:11] the the the the revealed
[32:16] word now this brother brother
[32:21] signy brother syney was also part of us
[32:26] as the bride
[32:30] but what made him a
[32:34] bride uh it's not his
[32:37] flesh what made him a
[32:40] bride is that now he received the
[32:45] we and then after receiving the
[32:48] weed then he didn't stop
[32:51] there he
[32:53] continued and then received also the
[32:57] revealed weight
[33:00] so now that very same we that he he
[33:03] received proceeded to be a revealed
[33:08] word now that revealed
[33:11] word made him the bride of
[33:14] Christ and then being the bride of
[33:18] Christ then he was able to conquer dead
[33:22] natural
[33:24] death by that we and when the time
[33:28] come that he should
[33:30] depart it's not a matter of departing
[33:34] not knowing where you are
[33:37] going right now Before you
[33:42] depart there is the
[33:45] Gathering there's a Gathering Place for
[33:51] departure are we together amen now even
[33:56] spiritually uh there is a Gathering
[33:59] Place now We Gather in the revealed word
[34:03] of
[34:05] God before we
[34:08] depart if you depart and going uh to
[34:11] some other
[34:14] places you need to go maybe to the
[34:16] airport or
[34:18] to to the bus
[34:20] stop or to the taxi
[34:23] rank now you wait for your transport
[34:27] there
[34:30] are we together now even
[34:33] spiritually before the
[34:36] departure the departure that I'm talking
[34:39] about I'm talking about the the
[34:43] Rapture now all of us
[34:47] everybody every
[34:49] Christian is speaking about the coming
[34:51] of the
[34:52] Lord even
[34:55] songs they sing about the coming of the
[34:58] Lord now everybody knows that the Lord
[35:02] is
[35:03] coming but let me say
[35:05] that now you have to
[35:08] know that there should be a Gathering
[35:13] Place uh before you could uh start your
[35:20] journey right now the word of
[35:23] God is the Gathering
[35:26] Place it must be the
[35:28] one that gathers you and make you one
[35:33] thing are we together and then after you
[35:36] are one
[35:38] thing that very same
[35:40] word then it becomes the revealed
[35:43] word now the revealed to
[35:46] it is the word that gives you
[35:51] Faith which we called rapturing
[35:56] Fai now that rapturing faith is what we
[36:00] called a seventh seal or the revelation
[36:03] of the seventh
[36:04] seal where you
[36:07] receive the faith of changing your
[36:12] body of which you cannot understand by a
[36:16] human
[36:19] mind that that very same word that is
[36:22] within
[36:24] you it has got a
[36:26] seed and that seed has got life within
[36:30] it are we together now that that word
[36:35] which is the seed then must germinate in
[36:40] you now that that is the one that will
[36:43] bring about the rapturing faith in
[36:47] you because now it's no more your
[36:51] mind now it's your your
[36:54] Supernatural or your divine nature now
[36:58] you change your
[37:00] nature then it becomes that of
[37:03] divine now our brother
[37:06] here when we say he he was one of us as
[37:11] the
[37:13] bride even now he is still a
[37:17] bride are we together now the bride of
[37:21] Christ is the revealed
[37:24] weight and when that weight is revealed
[37:27] then it makes you part and parcel of
[37:32] God and when you are part and parcel of
[37:36] God then you have
[37:38] now uh the the faith of
[37:43] God it's God
[37:45] himself that speaks to you and revealed
[37:49] himself unto
[37:50] you when Paul said I Know a Man in that
[37:56] heaven
[37:58] now he saw that man and he know who that
[38:01] man
[38:02] is but he kept quiet for 14
[38:07] years
[38:09] because even if he can tell
[38:12] you you'll be in another dimension then
[38:16] he'll be telling you things of another
[38:19] dimension now when
[38:22] somebody depart it it depart to another
[38:26] dimension
[38:28] of which we preach about that
[38:31] Dimension and when we preach with with
[38:33] that dimens okay let me say when you are
[38:37] when you are about to
[38:39] go you go to a Gathering
[38:42] Place a departing place then from that
[38:46] departing place then you receive the
[38:49] departing
[38:52] order you go to that place it could be
[38:55] an airport could be taxi rank it could
[38:59] be a bicycle rank but there is an order
[39:02] there is an
[39:03] order if if it's a
[39:05] flight you got your
[39:08] ticket it has got a ticket
[39:11] number and then in the time of
[39:14] departure and the time of arrival where
[39:16] you are
[39:17] going are we together now that types now
[39:21] the spiritual
[39:23] one before you could
[39:26] depart there is an order before you
[39:29] could be
[39:30] raptured there's what we call a
[39:32] rapturing f the order in which you are
[39:34] going to be
[39:36] raptured and then you you get your
[39:39] ticket
[39:40] number you get your code before you can
[39:44] be
[39:45] raptured now the code and the ticket
[39:50] number it's a rapturing faith that is in
[39:55] you you will be the one
[39:58] the Bible calls it your new
[40:01] name the Bible says it's a a hidden
[40:07] Mana it's it's a Mana but it's
[40:12] hidden look when
[40:14] Israel was about to leave
[40:19] Egypt they went somewhere they were not
[40:23] uh scattered
[40:25] anywhere they went to specific place
[40:28] where it's only the Hebrews that
[40:34] St and they went they waited and then
[40:37] they got an
[40:38] order from Moses through the angel of
[40:42] the
[40:43] Lord how is going to be the their
[40:47] departure they were given an
[40:50] order before we departure this is what
[40:54] you should do you slaughter a lamb
[40:58] you take the blood and smear smear
[41:02] it are we together now all those orders
[41:07] of how you eat that lamb and doing like
[41:09] that that was an
[41:12] order before the departure and the angel
[41:16] was introduced to
[41:18] them you
[41:20] cannot be raptured without the angel
[41:24] being introduced to you
[41:28] there should be an angel that is
[41:30] introduced to
[41:32] you are we together and then when you
[41:35] know that
[41:36] angel you will find that that angel is
[41:40] yourself are we together because this
[41:44] body is from our
[41:47] parents all together it's a temporary
[41:51] body but there is a supernatural or
[41:54] Divine
[41:56] body that comes from
[41:58] eternity that will came and engage this
[42:02] body then when it engag in this
[42:05] body there will be a time
[42:09] when this
[42:11] body because it comes from the dust it
[42:15] will go to the dust but the spirit says
[42:18] we who are
[42:20] alive there are those that will
[42:23] live there are those that will live
[42:26] before
[42:28] there are those that will will be alive
[42:31] until the other one
[42:35] resurrected are we together now we are
[42:38] living towards that era we're living at
[42:42] the last
[42:43] time there are those that go before
[42:47] us like brother
[42:49] sign he went before
[42:52] us but some of us maybe you are also one
[42:55] of them wait until the changing of your
[43:00] body even himself he will
[43:05] come and wear his
[43:07] body then after wearing his body then
[43:10] that body will change just like our Lord
[43:13] Jesus Christ the body was in the
[43:16] grave but after
[43:19] Resurrection there was no body in the
[43:21] grave so there won't be your body
[43:25] here your body will will be
[43:28] changed are we together now when the
[43:31] Lord
[43:33] says I lay down my
[43:37] life so that I could come and take it
[43:42] again which means then he had a
[43:47] power then where is the power if you
[43:50] read uh the book of First John I mean
[43:54] the Book of John chter 1:8
[43:58] the Bible says it says no one
[44:02] knows their father it's only the
[44:06] son that is in his
[44:09] botom are we together that declares
[44:13] him now when when Jesus
[44:17] Christ was
[44:19] through with what God want him send him
[44:22] here
[44:24] for now you have to know
[44:28] that you are here for a
[44:31] purpose are we
[44:33] together if you don't know the purpose
[44:37] then we are in the wrong
[44:41] direction everybody that is
[44:44] here or on Earth he should know the
[44:48] purpose of being in this
[44:52] earth and after knowing that he should
[44:56] know whether
[44:58] he's doing the part that he was sent to
[45:04] do
[45:06] Christ was God
[45:09] himself then when God was processing
[45:13] himself he needed a body because God is
[45:17] a spirit now God being a
[45:20] spirit he had a body which was Jesus now
[45:25] Jesus knew knew that his father which
[45:29] was Christ in
[45:31] him want he knew what he should be doing
[45:36] and then he knew the
[45:38] purpose of him being
[45:41] born now you should know the
[45:43] purpose you were born by your parents
[45:48] but there's a greater
[45:51] purpose above what your parent want you
[45:53] to
[45:55] do that is
[45:57] why when he was
[46:00] preaching and Mary
[46:03] arrived and his brothers
[46:06] arrived and they would say to him
[46:09] there's your mother and there's your
[46:11] brother then he would say my mother and
[46:14] my brothers are
[46:16] this because now I am about my
[46:22] father's are are we together now he was
[46:25] aware
[46:27] and when he was finished with what he's
[46:29] doing he was aware that now I am
[46:33] through now when you are through with
[46:37] what God want you to do
[46:40] in you must be aware that now I I am
[46:45] through you know there was a day when
[46:50] Jesus uh because it's during the week
[46:54] just take some few minutes you don't
[46:55] have to open your Bible read it for you
[46:58] we we'll read it the two of us you write
[47:00] it down I say our Lord Jesus
[47:05] Christ when he was through with what he
[47:08] was sent to
[47:10] do in the book of St
[47:14] John chapter 17 in verse one he
[47:18] says these words spake
[47:23] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[47:28] and said father the hour is
[47:34] come now can you tell God that the hour
[47:36] is
[47:38] come right now when God has revealed
[47:43] himself to
[47:44] you it will be
[47:47] himself speaking to
[47:50] himself when Jesus was here on Earth he
[47:54] was speaking about the father he said
[47:56] the son do
[47:59] nothing except me except he sees what
[48:03] the father want him to
[48:05] do are we together so now it it was the
[48:10] father doing in
[48:12] him it should be the father doing in
[48:16] you now he says father the hour is
[48:22] come glorify thy
[48:25] son that thy son Also may glorify
[48:30] you now who is glorifying
[48:33] who he says glorify thy
[48:37] son so that thy son can glorify
[48:41] them so it's one and the same
[48:46] person it's just now in this
[48:49] dispensation he was for a specific
[48:53] purpose now even you yourself
[48:57] in this
[48:58] dispensation it is for a specific
[49:01] purpose even brother
[49:04] himself he had a
[49:06] purpose God has a purpose about
[49:10] him are we together when God had a
[49:13] purpose about
[49:15] him he knew that God had okay there was
[49:20] a time way turned
[49:22] blind the eye could not
[49:25] see but we are all
[49:27] aware that now the eye is not the real
[49:31] thing that
[49:33] sees the ey is just a
[49:38] camera but what the eyes
[49:41] see interpreted by the
[49:45] brain that's why we have blind
[49:47] people that that are even clever
[49:51] than
[49:54] us are we together we we brother
[49:58] Antony and then the service I'm sure we
[50:01] are more than a
[50:03] thousand but but anony could recognize
[50:06] the voice of each and
[50:08] everyone if he can speak to
[50:11] you and know who you are then even if
[50:15] you call
[50:16] him he will before you could say how are
[50:20] you he would say how are
[50:24] you you see now to saw that now there is
[50:27] a mind that interpret
[50:30] that but I'm not there now now our Lord
[50:34] says glorify th thy
[50:39] son that thy son Also may glorify thee
[50:43] you should come to the
[50:45] point look there was a
[50:48] time when Moses send uh Joshua and Caleb
[50:57] to spy the
[50:59] land right they went and spy the land
[51:04] but in spying the
[51:05] Land There was a
[51:08] promise from Moses that you
[51:12] Caleb there's your place Moses didn't go
[51:16] there Caleb went in
[51:19] there and recognize his his in
[51:24] inheritance and then he spoke to to to
[51:27] Joshua and said do you remember I was
[51:30] with you we went and SPID the land do
[51:33] you still remember my
[51:36] place are we together now you should
[51:38] know your place
[51:41] now your
[51:44] inheritance you are not
[51:47] here without a
[51:50] purpose God didn't bring you
[51:53] here without a purpose
[51:56] remember that your
[51:58] inheritance is eternal
[52:01] life that is
[52:03] why Jesus was not
[52:07] worried about going to
[52:11] Calvary he want
[52:14] calv even the disciples were trying to
[52:16] stop him then he would say get out of my
[52:20] way you Dev because he was on his way to
[52:23] to
[52:24] Calvary to lay his life
[52:27] down so that he could take it up
[52:31] again we together that is why after I
[52:34] took it
[52:35] up he said I was dead now I am
[52:40] alive I have the keys you see of
[52:46] death and hell do you hear what it means
[52:50] he's got all the keys now he says I laid
[52:53] my life down so that I could possess
[52:57] what is
[52:59] mind the Bible speaks about the the the
[53:03] the
[53:05] Overcomers that you cannot be called an
[53:09] overcomer without
[53:12] fighting and winning that
[53:15] battle that makes you an
[53:17] overcomer now we cannot worship a
[53:20] God that could not defeat the
[53:23] dev and we cannot say we are the
[53:26] children of
[53:27] God being persecuted by the devil we
[53:31] know where our power
[53:34] is are we together so now he continues
[53:38] and
[53:39] say I'm going to
[53:43] jump in verse four he
[53:46] says I have glorified thee on the
[53:53] earth I have finished the work which
[53:56] thou Gest me to
[54:02] do you hear what he says I have
[54:07] finished the
[54:09] work that
[54:13] you that thou Gest me to
[54:18] do now each and everyone of
[54:21] us is given a work to do
[54:27] you should be there should come a
[54:29] time where you are so
[54:32] brave to even tell God that father I
[54:37] have finished the
[54:40] work you you you you you are not just a
[54:43] church
[54:45] goer you are a
[54:49] possessor are we together amen now you
[54:52] must know actually what you should
[54:55] possess
[54:59] don't measure Yourself by yourself
[55:01] that's what Paul
[55:03] says we have a
[55:06] measurement and then don't fight against
[55:09] an air don't don't make a Shadow
[55:14] Boxing you must know who your enemy
[55:19] is are we together amen right in verse
[55:22] five again it says and now oh Father
[55:26] glorify thy thou
[55:30] me with thine own
[55:41] selfy
[55:43] me oh Father glorify thou me with thine
[55:47] own
[55:50] self in in other words he
[55:53] says father
[55:57] become
[56:03] myself become
[56:06] myself so that I want to be
[56:09] God that's what the Bible
[56:12] says that in the last days it will be
[56:15] you remember John
[56:17] 14:20 you know it yeah so now there's a
[56:21] time in in John
[56:24] 10:30 10 he says I and my father are
[56:29] one in John uh
[56:33] 14:20 it says in that day you shall
[56:37] know that I am in the
[56:39] father you in me an i in
[56:44] you now he says an i in
[56:48] you then you should know
[56:50] that he is in
[56:53] you and then when he's in you then you
[56:57] claim that because you are in me then I
[57:01] am yourself that's what Jesus said he
[57:05] says glorify
[57:06] me with th own
[57:10] self right with th own self in other
[57:14] words you should become
[57:20] God okay
[57:26] they saying what does this old man want
[57:28] to say okay what I'm trying to
[57:31] say the man which used to be
[57:35] called
[57:42] syney you won't find in
[57:46] heaven you won't
[57:49] find in heaven and you won't find the
[57:51] muas in heaven the m is just a temporary
[57:55] name
[57:59] that like yourself the name that you are
[58:03] having is a temporary
[58:06] one the Bible
[58:09] says he that
[58:13] overcometh I will give him to eat from a
[58:17] hidden
[58:19] man and then I'll give him a white
[58:23] stone and in that stone
[58:26] his new name new name new
[58:32] name now it's not that somebody a new
[58:36] name you are restored back to where you
[58:39] come
[58:41] from are we together now the
[58:46] restoration has a scripturally
[58:52] happened we have been
[58:54] restored now that we have been restored
[58:58] we need to go
[58:59] now and go and
[59:02] have h a
[59:07] supper with our Lord we have to change
[59:10] this body and wear another body and go
[59:14] for the Lord
[59:18] supp after the
[59:21] restoration are we together and then
[59:24] from there
[59:25] on will be with him in different
[59:29] dispensation until
[59:32] eternally are we together no now what is
[59:36] called
[59:38] death it's a useless
[59:41] power the thing that is called death you
[59:45] know if you go to Hebrews chapter
[59:49] 2 verse 14 says ver he became a man
[59:56] so that he could fight
[59:58] death so that those that are bound by
[1:00:01] death those that are afraid of death
[1:00:05] should be
[1:00:07] relieved are we together amen death has
[1:00:12] got no
[1:00:14] power it's just a departure of a saint
[1:00:17] going
[1:00:20] home it has it can have a
[1:00:24] power it it can have power if you reject
[1:00:28] the word of
[1:00:31] God let me quote another
[1:00:34] verse Mark
[1:00:37] 8 uh verse 34
[1:00:40] says and when he had called the people
[1:00:43] unto him with his disciples
[1:00:48] also then he said unto
[1:00:50] them whosoever will come after me
[1:00:56] let him deny
[1:00:59] himself and take up his
[1:01:01] cross and follow me see now he
[1:01:08] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:01:12] deny
[1:01:13] himself that's what my brother did he
[1:01:17] denied
[1:01:18] himself and took his
[1:01:20] cross and and was baptized in the name
[1:01:23] of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:01:27] received a
[1:01:29] Ministry
[1:01:31] where he could
[1:01:33] depart not
[1:01:35] everybody could depart if you sit in
[1:01:38] your
[1:01:39] house and say
[1:01:43] uh you won go to to you will be saying
[1:01:47] you want to go to
[1:01:49] town until you stand
[1:01:51] up and go to the tax rank
[1:01:56] then you'll be on your way to town but
[1:01:58] but to say I am going to town but to say
[1:02:01] I want to go to heaven sitting on your
[1:02:05] rock rocking chair there is a
[1:02:09] venue there is a
[1:02:11] place the message of the hour of
[1:02:17] departure if you want to go you you go
[1:02:21] to that Tex R the message of the
[1:02:26] the Bible says behold I will send you
[1:02:31] Elijah
[1:02:33] theh before the great and Dreadful day
[1:02:36] of the
[1:02:37] Lord that's why the Bible says in our
[1:02:40] time he will change the heart of the
[1:02:43] what you
[1:02:45] call of the children to their
[1:02:51] fathers they once ask our Lord Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ watch should we
[1:02:56] do to keep the word of
[1:02:59] God you know what he said he said you
[1:03:03] should believe the one that is
[1:03:07] sent there's
[1:03:09] somebody who God will send look during
[1:03:13] the time of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:15] everybody was saying messiah messiah
[1:03:18] messiah all the priest the Pharisees the
[1:03:23] sagues they say the Messiah
[1:03:27] until John come John was the one that
[1:03:31] would say
[1:03:33] behold now
[1:03:35] anybody that denied the ministry of
[1:03:38] John could not meet the
[1:03:41] Messiah because John saw
[1:03:44] him when the spirit descended in him
[1:03:48] even in our
[1:03:50] time
[1:03:51] wait in order that you should see the
[1:03:55] second coming of
[1:03:57] Christ you should listen to what the
[1:04:00] Bible
[1:04:01] says behold I will send you
[1:04:06] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:04:10] Dreadful day of the
[1:04:11] Lord he will
[1:04:14] turn your
[1:04:16] heart he will turn the heart of the
[1:04:22] Lans it's the end time he will turn the
[1:04:25] heart
[1:04:27] the people of this
[1:04:29] world together to that of our
[1:04:33] fathers to the ministry of
[1:04:35] Paul and then from there on then you
[1:04:39] will
[1:04:40] meet the
[1:04:42] angel show you Ministry of your
[1:04:46] hour are we together the ministry of
[1:04:49] your hour is that you should go he will
[1:04:53] show you the station
[1:04:56] where you have to stand and wait for
[1:04:58] your
[1:05:00] departure are we together with the
[1:05:04] Revelation with all the power with all
[1:05:07] the knowledge with all the understanding
[1:05:10] with all the
[1:05:12] faith are we together that's what
[1:05:15] brother sign did he waited at the right
[1:05:20] station having the right
[1:05:22] knowledge having the right understanding
[1:05:25] yeah I am at the right place yeah I'm
[1:05:28] going
[1:05:31] home even if he was sick he knew that
[1:05:35] this
[1:05:37] body this body cannot
[1:05:40] inherit the kingdom of God he knew about
[1:05:44] that because he was they called him
[1:05:49] mud Ms I mean knew that this body cannot
[1:05:56] inherit the Kingdom of Heaven you should
[1:05:59] know that your body will never inherit
[1:06:04] the so there's a body that will
[1:06:08] inherit the kingdom
[1:06:10] of so now we don't have to worry about
[1:06:15] the departure of
[1:06:16] brother we will be with
[1:06:19] him we will be with him within a blink
[1:06:23] of an eye the time
[1:06:26] and the signs are
[1:06:28] telling he denied
[1:06:31] himself and take up his cross that's why
[1:06:34] he said now that's why Jesus said I will
[1:06:37] lay
[1:06:38] down verse 35
[1:06:41] said Mark 8:35 said for whosoever will
[1:06:45] save his
[1:06:48] life shall lose
[1:06:50] it
[1:06:52] whosoever shall save his life
[1:06:58] then he shall lose
[1:07:00] it and
[1:07:02] whosoever shall lose his
[1:07:06] life for my
[1:07:08] sake and the
[1:07:11] peoples is the same shall save
[1:07:15] it so now if you want to save his
[1:07:19] life Proverbs chapter 8
[1:07:23] verse 35
[1:07:25] 835 it says he that found
[1:07:31] me has find
[1:07:33] life now he has find
[1:07:36] him he has find life if you find the
[1:07:40] word of
[1:07:41] God then you find
[1:07:45] life verse 36 verse 36 for what shall it
[1:07:50] profit a
[1:07:52] man if he shall gain the whole
[1:07:57] world and lose his own
[1:08:02] soul can I repeat
[1:08:04] that for who shall I mean what shall
[1:08:08] profit a
[1:08:09] man if he shall gain the whole
[1:08:13] world and lose his own
[1:08:18] life and 37 he said7 or what shall a man
[1:08:22] give in exchange of his soul
[1:08:31] there is nothing that you can do to
[1:08:34] exchange your
[1:08:37] soul your soul your soul is your
[1:08:41] life and your soul was not
[1:08:45] created your soul was processed from
[1:08:50] God now if it was processed from God
[1:08:54] what was created was just
[1:08:57] body then what shall a man give in
[1:09:04] exchange because the soul
[1:09:06] itself it's the soul itself you cannot
[1:09:10] exchange
[1:09:12] it are we together your
[1:09:15] body is just a place where your soul
[1:09:20] lives you can't exchange it the owner of
[1:09:24] that soul
[1:09:26] will the one is the one that will bring
[1:09:29] back the soul to
[1:09:33] himself when God created I mean formed a
[1:09:37] Man Out of the
[1:09:39] Dust that man had no
[1:09:42] soul and until God breathe a
[1:09:47] spirit and then after he breathe the
[1:09:49] spirit then God took his own
[1:09:53] soul and put it in that man and Man
[1:09:57] became a living
[1:09:59] Soul are we together amen and when man
[1:10:04] backlighted took back his soul to
[1:10:08] himself together and then now what what
[1:10:11] has happened he has brought that soul in
[1:10:15] the form of the
[1:10:20] word in the
[1:10:21] process he gave you Faith he gave you V
[1:10:26] he gave you knowledge he gave you
[1:10:28] Temperance
[1:10:30] patience
[1:10:32] godliness brother kindness and say this
[1:10:35] one is complete and then he took his
[1:10:37] soul again and give it back to
[1:10:41] you so now when you
[1:10:44] depart the soul
[1:10:48] goes how together am he's got a prepared
[1:10:52] place a prepared dimension
[1:10:55] where he keep your
[1:10:57] soul that's your real you
[1:11:00] now that's your real body
[1:11:03] now are we together that one does not
[1:11:07] age that one isn't got gray
