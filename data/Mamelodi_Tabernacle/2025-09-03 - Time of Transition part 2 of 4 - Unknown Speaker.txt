And in another book again he tells you that this book was written before the foundation in the se before the foundation of the world. And he says, "And your name was put &gt;&gt; your name was put there before the foundation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the book is revealed, the name is revealed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the name doesn't say a &gt;&gt; but the prophet says you only receive &gt;&gt; if maybe my new name is Israel. He says while he's calling that name receiving a revelation means that I have heard my [Applause] redemption is those whose names &gt;&gt; were in the lambs of Now we have two &gt;&gt; and it's two books and the white fl &gt;&gt; because the judgment will be out of the book of life's book of life in the lamb's book of life already passed the judgment Those [Applause] the foolish vigil those in the book of life &gt;&gt; will be judged according their work. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have done past judgment &gt;&gt; and on that day it will be like a queen. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we shall execute judgment together with the husbands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says you shall judge angels. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, now the name in this other book, which today I'm not talking about that, &gt;&gt; but in this lamb's book of life, &gt;&gt; your name is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Forever and ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not reversible. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; In the book of life was also his name was in the book of life in the ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it was time to show his colors, when the Holy Ghost came to be judged &gt;&gt; out of the book of life, &gt;&gt; but we can dance and sing because we have passed judgment. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's seven seal book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we will pass here a bit. Now, &gt;&gt; now the prophet page 8 uh 78. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The book of seals. Now, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; it says now because if you read with this mechy god unveiled before us, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; then he tells you there that the word tells you that &gt;&gt; h redemption means to take something back to its original &gt;&gt; you all know that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we should not know it as a way. Which one is original life? &gt;&gt; Original place. &gt;&gt; Now he says original place where you were before &gt;&gt; we were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's where we were. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now the book of that's why the book of John says it tells me the same the same thing here. The epistle of John. All right. &gt;&gt; I I usually read it to the people and let me just read this part quickly &gt;&gt; and we go back to our scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H first epistle of John chapter one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That which was from the beginning &gt;&gt; which we have heard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which we have seen. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Now uh which is it says which is the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in the beginning was the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that which we have seen &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; which we have seen which our eyes with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. Uh because &gt;&gt; there's there's many beginnings. &gt;&gt; Now we have the Genesis beginning &gt;&gt; which is a the material. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God created heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; That is the material. &gt;&gt; But we have the beginning. &gt;&gt; This beginning in the beginning was the way &gt;&gt; which was before Genesis. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, before Genesis, &gt;&gt; h there was a beginning before Genesis. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Not not not I'm not referring to creation. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; Before this h they call it the sixth chapter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was in the beginning was the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Was God that was God &gt;&gt; unfolding himself [Applause] &gt;&gt; to become man like &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now h the beginning of the unfolding of God is called in the beginning was the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But the beginning of creation is in the beginning God created. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have this now the beginning of John &gt;&gt; came before the beginning of Genesis. &gt;&gt; The beginning of John created the beginning of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Now you take your souls in prison. &gt;&gt; Souls in prison tells you the first man is spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let because we are going to see how do we receive the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; God know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal was not revealed in the church ages. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It was beyond time. &gt;&gt; That's why now a man can crack his his head. &gt;&gt; One say there's 14 seals. The other one say there's no seals. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The other one says this and that &gt;&gt; because the seven seals &gt;&gt; were revealed after the end of time of change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Beyond time of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now if it's beyond time &gt;&gt; now God says to the prophet tell it to no man &gt;&gt; and the prophet says it is in my heart and the devil can't see it. &gt;&gt; In the heart is not referring to the flesh. &gt;&gt; No. is referring to the compartment [Music] &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where God cannot share with Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God cannot share his throne with God. The devil is out. If God is on his in [Applause] &gt;&gt; but which Christ am I talking about today? We are talking about Christ who is the revelation of the seven son. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And did you read it? &gt;&gt; Did you read this part? &gt;&gt; Okay. Where's the book? Maybe I can read it quickly here &gt;&gt; because the people don't know where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, the people today don't know where Christ is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Now, and here is your your book. I I will read this part again. &gt;&gt; He is the one who opened those seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is those seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the whole word of God is Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the seals that were open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals then? Revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; 41. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals is revealing &gt;&gt; not Jesus. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is I will repeat this again. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; if Jesus can walk in the building here, &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; In his given form, &gt;&gt; he will look like any other &gt;&gt; brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can &gt;&gt; we can even introduce him today. &gt;&gt; We also greet our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. thinking maybe he's from like here no one will recognize [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; what are you what are you going to do if we can't recognize him as &gt;&gt; something must Let's look how how it happened. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; To somebody or to recognize him in the Bible and how how we will recognize &gt;&gt; him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, &gt;&gt; now let me quote it. Meanwhile, it says now John &gt;&gt; wouldn't recognize Jesus &gt;&gt; standing &gt;&gt; because he was a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it says e looked ordinary. to &gt;&gt; and he says, "I'm just trying to p it, but let me just quote it to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will just quote it to you because I've got it here. John the Baptist, &gt;&gt; that great prophet &gt;&gt; that came forth and said, &gt;&gt; "There is one standing among you right now, &gt;&gt; an ordinary man." &gt;&gt; Standing &gt;&gt; here somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now John said there's one standing among you. [Music] &gt;&gt; So people could look around. &gt;&gt; Which one? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then it there must be a way for John to see him. Amen. &gt;&gt; John will be standing there &gt;&gt; until he's buried. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People &gt;&gt; remain in the churches for years &gt;&gt; and not met Christ. [Applause] Amen. Yeah. Amen. H the theme the purpose of the word &gt;&gt; is is not just to become an orator &gt;&gt; the purpose is for the people &gt;&gt; to meet God [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was saying that if you can take a group of people &gt;&gt; and ask them to sing &gt;&gt; Yeah. And everyone becomes a hero. You know they are standing so the cameras after that h the adjudicator will shake all all the hands &gt;&gt; but some of them &gt;&gt; if you want to hear &gt;&gt; you must ask them to sing one word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when you realize that &gt;&gt; being among many people, you can be counted as a healer. &gt;&gt; Some people &gt;&gt; in the church &gt;&gt; they are also Christians, &gt;&gt; right? But let him be found alone. &gt;&gt; That is something. [Music] Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So John the Baptist, that great prophet that come forth said there is one standing among you right now. &gt;&gt; An ordinary man. &gt;&gt; That's the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John said, "I bore record. I bear record. I saw the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a dove &gt;&gt; and it went upon him &gt;&gt; and a voice said this is my beloved my beloved son in whom I'm pleased. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh e what was it? &gt;&gt; He says look John the Baptist would never have known Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. If it if it hadn't been a for the Holy Ghost pointing [Music] &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one could come by looking at him and say I can see if you are Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why they missed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't find him because he was a man working. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he was even penniless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know now a canon man &gt;&gt; walking beside the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; and he cast a fig tree because there was no fig and he was angry. angry. &gt;&gt; So a young man would say this is &gt;&gt; today you are driving in a car. &gt;&gt; The disciples were &gt;&gt; Oh my god. And that day had their gray lips &gt;&gt; more than the people in the [Music] &gt;&gt; metropolitan cities. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Once there's no relish in the house, they think there's no God &gt;&gt; because they think God consist consist of relish, money and so forth. &gt;&gt; We we were in Mozambique with brothers and sisters there. &gt;&gt; There is no bank, &gt;&gt; no restaurant, &gt;&gt; no McDonald's. Never. &gt;&gt; No. I've never seen bread. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; nothing. H what they do? They they pound their mill. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everything is is primitive. &gt;&gt; So they pound their mill to to make a pet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing.

And we had a why do you call this? &gt;&gt; We had one as amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me and the brothers put up in the pickup. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the sisters in the in a vehicle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't know the name of these things. Correct. &gt;&gt; So now, but if you go there, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the day we arrive here, baptize 34 people. &gt;&gt; Amen. is there in I don't know if the government knows [Music] &gt;&gt; there's no Amen to follow the path pass &gt;&gt; and then to to the place &gt;&gt; the tabernacle is made of mud &gt;&gt; they just put the sticks together like this. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the Lord's coming. &gt;&gt; After the service, &gt;&gt; there's nothing like pastors will eat in that. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is everybody for himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. After the service they just sing happily rejoicing in the Lord and they just vanish from South Africa we have left up and down &gt;&gt; you must cook for yourself &gt;&gt; and everything like that &gt;&gt; but the quality [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know if you go to mommy and say what what's the name of this place? &gt;&gt; What is the name of this place? &gt;&gt; Park. &gt;&gt; If you go to mommy and say to the people let's go to fun park. The first thing is budget. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many am I going to lose? &gt;&gt; They [Applause] rather abstain &gt;&gt; than spend the few &gt;&gt; rents. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can't go to it's too expensive. &gt;&gt; Petrol is expensive these days. &gt;&gt; And then you go to I went to Milan where the people walked &gt;&gt; mountain after mountain &gt;&gt; some children strapped &gt;&gt; to their backs. And I was with the brother when a pastor came working for three days to [Applause] &gt;&gt; the I managed to eat sweet potatoes and the things because they are not they were not westernized. They are not from South Africa &gt;&gt; because here they are sprayed and then &gt;&gt; then you need to put sugar. [Music] You see &gt;&gt; and the mill is first class. &gt;&gt; Then now we will deceive you by saying super minimal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. But super a super minimal is the one you get from the field. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at the super church now. &gt;&gt; A church from the field of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You don't need to spice it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the book here. or let me try to &gt;&gt; glory to God &gt;&gt; keep time &gt;&gt; try to keep time now uh here we are yesterday we were here &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; now here's the place where h sometimes the people &gt;&gt; h they come to a breakdown &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; that is at the end of the seven church Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now at the end of the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; H we see the prophet brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he is the forerunner to introduce &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; today's rebecca. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are going to look at why brother he doesn't say Jesus is the mystery of &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; Jesus is the container &gt;&gt; because he took the book from within himself which was not in a book form because it was written recently &gt;&gt; and we call it a book. That is the very same book forbidden to write. &gt;&gt; And you that you possess [Applause] [Music] us to sing to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And yes to the Lord. &gt;&gt; But this is the greatest angel of all the ages. &gt;&gt; Says the people who went before are waiting upon us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the cap of the whole &gt;&gt; pastor. &gt;&gt; Now what kind of people ought we to be &gt;&gt; here? The ministry that is here. &gt;&gt; Yes. The pastor here has got a ministry &gt;&gt; and he he can preach to Paul and Peter &gt;&gt; because they were anticipating &gt;&gt; they were looking forward to &gt;&gt; that's why Paul says of the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; no one should deceive you. Because Paul saw it coming down. &gt;&gt; So he knew there must be a minister there &gt;&gt; to announce his immediate. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the ministry here I can take the book and go to Peter and say Peter [Music] &gt;&gt; that thing is here you sometimes wonder &gt;&gt; why the people &gt;&gt; why Here's John. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the Here is John. John chapter one. He says, "I never knew him." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; John himself, you say, "I never knew him." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the one who sent me &gt;&gt; told me that the one whom I will see a light of resting upon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at it. Now, here is Jesus standing there. John know him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The only way he can know him &gt;&gt; is for the supernatural to come. &gt;&gt; Because the thing John must forun is this one. [Music] But now the supernatural was put in the body. &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus standing there, John was looking at Jesus at the people waiting for the other part &gt;&gt; which has a a a twofold being &gt;&gt; like we are. &gt;&gt; One part is the seven changes, one part is the six. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you won't see the seals like as you see the the seven changes. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; one is time, one is &gt;&gt; the seven church ages. That's why we have so many preachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some are going this way this way because it's time is ages. &gt;&gt; Now senses are active. &gt;&gt; That's why we have we have Bethl, Jero, Jordan, &gt;&gt; but Elisha was not part of it. Noise &gt;&gt; Elishah walked inwardly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw what was in. &gt;&gt; So he followed Elijah because he saw what was in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was an insider. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they reach Jordan &gt;&gt; saw uh they they crossed over. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So a bigger numberantity &gt;&gt; remained this side of &gt;&gt; Jordan [Music] &gt;&gt; and cross. &gt;&gt; Now Elishah was not just a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was a believer with a people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't believe only in profession. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he believed in possession. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't possess, you become a &gt;&gt; profess. &gt;&gt; God is in the prophet. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; and that is profession. When Elisha was following Elijah to Jordan, &gt;&gt; it was still a prophet. But when they were over Jordan [Music] that the thing was in &gt;&gt; that show that the thing was in brother &gt;&gt; why the people don't see the seals &gt;&gt; it is because &gt;&gt; they were in a man &gt;&gt; it's also the seven &gt;&gt; se as We we will just for a few minutes &gt;&gt; look at it. &gt;&gt; What happened &gt;&gt; in Genesis? There was no man to kill the ground. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Only man God had was a spirit. &gt;&gt; Adam was a spirit. &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't till the ground. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; Now till the ground doesn't mean Adam with a fork was the ground. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people dream of seeing Adam with a pig. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; He was the god of nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Controlled nature. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; So when there was no man to till the ground before there was if &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know if was not if she was &gt;&gt; she was called &gt;&gt; only after the fall she was called &gt;&gt; the fall she was called. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The fall is Adam who said you are never God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; God had to bring down the man because you know me and you &gt;&gt; we were our our spirit was not created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was yours created? [Music] &gt;&gt; Your spirit was not created. &gt;&gt; Your your spirit God processed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From being a &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; from being a thought &gt;&gt; attriute. &gt;&gt; So now it was processed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was process the body was created. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The body was created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the spirit was not created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now for a man to till the ground, &gt;&gt; God had to someone to to mold. &gt;&gt; Yes. A body &gt;&gt; from the ground. a body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For to tilt the ground. &gt;&gt; And he had to summon the spirit man into that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to give it a nature. &gt;&gt; He was called a living soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's do it like this &gt;&gt; a bit and fear not going to belong here. Unless you [Music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here we are. We are coming here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'll come back to this for a for a for a while. Okay. Here we have six days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we've seen this before. One, two, three, four, five, six. Next time we'll I give to the brothers so to deem it there. &gt;&gt; H six days of creation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the Bible says uh these things were like seals &gt;&gt; because God said let there be and brother Brenam says &gt;&gt; and there was no light to be seen until that way it was manifested &gt;&gt; so he says it started with a saying &gt;&gt; let there be &gt;&gt; and the one says no no no brother the Bible says Let there be light. And there was light. &gt;&gt; Yes, there was light in God. There was light &gt;&gt; and but the light the material &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; appeared the thing was the way was materialized. &gt;&gt; When the way was manifested &gt;&gt; that is God's system. &gt;&gt; Let there be the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there was no right to be seen. &gt;&gt; So it is seen only when it is manifested. &gt;&gt; Now there was no man to till the ground. &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, the Bible says God rested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He did nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the seventh day. Hey. &gt;&gt; And God God was looking for a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because men is an amate god. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or a a a a little god under God. &gt;&gt; God, the God of nature. &gt;&gt; So because God said, "Let us make man in our image." So that means he made another god. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's &gt;&gt; why brother Brenam says the thing you have lost is your &gt;&gt; I was just recently saying that preaching in it I don't remember but like that what you need &gt;&gt; what we are looking for &gt;&gt; is not to be a great man &gt;&gt; or to be a better pastor &gt;&gt; or to know better than on board &gt;&gt; or to win a big church. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Or to belong to that. &gt;&gt; What you need is your gosh. &gt;&gt; You have lost something. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have lost what you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one of us knows where he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. where he is from. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So now that is what you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have your other self. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So God had to summon men from the spirit. The spirit. &gt;&gt; I can't write from this side. My hand is now here. Here on earth, it's a man. &gt;&gt; That man is just a &gt;&gt; statue. &gt;&gt; Lifeless. &gt;&gt; Now, God has to bring down &gt;&gt; the spirit down to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In order to be able &gt;&gt; to till the ground &gt;&gt; to do his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the garden which was placed eastward. Hey &gt;&gt; and the man was placed there. &gt;&gt; And so now he held the that position. &gt;&gt; As we see the cherabs were just substitutes there substitute for standing for the men to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know how that sword was given. &gt;&gt; I saw &gt;&gt; amen. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Then he says later when it was revealed it was [Music] &gt;&gt; that [Applause] you see when it is in use. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; In the battle of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why he says you haven't yet seen &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You haven't seen all of &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; He brings that pull in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. What what was the third sister? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this &gt;&gt; brother Brennham says to Sister Hi. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sister Hy got a sick mother. &gt;&gt; And what else? You don't have money. &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing. &gt;&gt; So ask anything.
