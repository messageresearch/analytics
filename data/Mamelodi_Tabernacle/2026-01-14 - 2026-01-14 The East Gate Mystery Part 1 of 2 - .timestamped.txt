[0:31] We we want to thank everybody.
[0:36] Well, from here we cannot see all the
[0:38] faces.
[0:42] But as long as you are under this roof,
[0:44] you you are one of us.
[0:49] Amen. Amen. M so the Lord bless you.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; We are just going to stand up and read
[0:58] the word of God for for
[1:04] just to add more blessings to what the
[1:07] Lord has
[1:09] given to us already.
[1:15] our pastors here.
[1:21] My soul is full with delight
[1:28] having our pastors here.
[1:31] Amen. Amen. As we turn to our Bibles,
[1:38] um I'm just going to read some
[1:41] uh two scriptures, the Lord willing.
[1:46] Genesis chapter 3 verse chapter 2:8
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 2:8
[1:52] &gt;&gt; and Genesis 3 22- 24
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Galatians 3 verse 22- 24
[2:10] sorry
[2:20] Chapter 3
[2:22] verse 22 to 24. Amen.
[3:10] Amen. Brother, do you have this uh
[3:14] English Bible there?
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[3:18] And the Lord God planted a garden
[3:20] eastward in
[3:23] there he put the man whom he had formed.
[3:27] Genesis 3 verse 22- 24. And the Lord God
[3:32] said, "Behold, the man is become as one
[3:35] of us to know good and evil. And now
[3:39] least he put forth his hand and take
[3:42] also the tree of life and eat and live
[3:46] forever.
[3:47] Therefore, the Lord sent the Lord God
[3:50] sent him forth from the garden of Eden
[3:53] to the ground from when he was taken. So
[3:57] he drove out the man and he placed at
[4:00] the east of the garden of Eden cherubim
[4:03] and a flaming sword which turned every
[4:06] way to keep the way of the tree of life.
[4:10] Let us pray.
[4:24] the eagles.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Because
[4:28] wherever the eagles are gathered,
[4:32] the wherever the cacus is, the eagles
[4:35] will be gathered.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; H we were taught by the prophet of God
[4:40] that the cacas is the word of God. So
[4:44] father we are this morning around the
[4:46] table of life just father to uh h uh to
[4:51] to receive from you the blessings that
[4:54] you have in store for us this morning.
[4:56] May you bless every brother and sister.
[4:59] Thanking you for the pastors that are
[5:01] with in our midst here this morning.
[5:04] Father, it's such a tremendous uh uh
[5:07] blessing to us to have them with us.
[5:09] They had traveled him from far away as
[5:12] it was so in the Bible. They came from
[5:15] east and west and they met in the center
[5:18] of life which is the word of God. We
[5:22] thank you for the revelation in our day
[5:25] that we are able to see and we have met
[5:30] one another under this word in Jesus
[5:33] Christ's name I pray for the blessings
[5:35] upon all the brothers and sisters
[5:38] gathered in this place.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; You may be seated for
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We
[5:46] we thank God for the
[5:50] uh
[5:52] uh for this day.
[5:56] As we were traveling back from
[5:59] Petersburg, brother
[6:01] GMA u he said something
[6:06] that left me thinking more deeper.
[6:15] when he said we were here last Thursday
[6:19] for our service.
[6:26] Now, brother G says uh it was a very uh
[6:30] blessing message and
[6:33] maybe if we were together uh uh uh it
[6:37] would have been something more better.
[6:40] He was thinking uh upon those lines.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now uh now in my heart then I I
[6:56] thought of maybe taking a part of that
[6:59] message this morning.
[7:06] H as this is the the the the the message
[7:10] of the hour.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Now, if you read in the Bible,
[7:18] um the first man was placed eastward
[7:27] and the garden which was the
[7:29] headquarters of the man, the son of God
[7:33] and the daughter of God as the prophet
[7:35] says, was eastward.
[7:47] And uh we understand that when uh um
[7:52] the time they uh the serpent tarnish the
[7:57] program of God.
[8:03] So God drove men uh out the east gate
[8:13] and we are told uh of the prophet that
[8:16] uh that place was the place of worship.
[8:24] This is gate was the place of worship.
[8:30] So I want to speak uh to bring a subject
[8:34] on that h point
[8:40] the east gate mystery.
[8:47] Amen. And uh as we I'm going to quote
[8:51] some few things here
[8:56] uh for the message believers.
[8:59] message.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Now my text is going to be coming back
[9:04] east.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; And uh uh now in the book of revelation
[9:15] Genesis
[9:18] the Bible says
[9:21] and
[9:23] uh and God said let there be light. That
[9:26] is verse three.
[9:30] And there was light.
[9:33] And God saw the light that it was good.
[9:35] And God deliver divided the light from
[9:37] the darkness.
[9:42] And God called the light day and the
[9:44] darkness he called night and the evening
[9:47] and the morning were the first day.
[9:54] Now, I
[9:57] looked into a book where scientists were
[9:59] trying to uh uh h
[10:04] interpret this this light
[10:13] and and one of them he said we don't
[10:17] know about this light.
[10:22] Why? Because uh this was not a natural
[10:26] light.
[10:31] And if you read in the book uh it is the
[10:34] rising of the sun
[10:38] is the rising and the prophet says the
[10:40] first light was the spoken word.
[10:47] He says when God said let there be
[10:48] light,
[10:51] that light was the spoken word.
[10:56] Because the Bible says in the beginning
[10:58] was light was the word
[11:03] and the word was the light of men.
[11:08] And the Bible again
[11:11] if I I'm going to read some things here.
[11:16] Now the morning
[11:19] the Bible says
[11:21] &gt;&gt; we are going back to these things
[11:25] and and the evening and the morning were
[11:28] the first day
[11:33] now not the morning and the evening
[11:38] &gt;&gt; the evening and the morning
[11:43] which evening Evening speaks of westing
[11:49] and morning speaks of east.
[11:53] Now we speak of the prophet speaks of
[11:57] the east people and the western people.
[12:04] The eastern people
[12:06] and the western people.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; The Jews and the Gentiles.
[12:14] And now we have come to realize that the
[12:19] evening and the morning
[12:26] &gt;&gt; is today called
[12:30] let me read it first.
[12:33] Amen.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we went through that last
[12:36] time
[12:38] because the Bible says
[12:42] uh ju just read for me Thessalonians 5:1
[12:46] to5
[12:48] first Thessalonians
[12:49] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse chapter
[12:53] 1 verse 5
[12:55] &gt;&gt; chapter 5 verse 1-5
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Okay it it it reads this
[13:05] But of the times and the seasons,
[13:07] brethren, you have no need that I write
[13:09] unto you.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Thessalonians
[13:15] Thessalonians chapter 5. But of the
[13:19] times and the seasons, brethren, you
[13:21] have no need that I write unto you.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:36] Amen.
[13:45] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[13:48] Uh for yourself know perfectly that the
[13:51] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[13:54] the night.
[14:02] Yeah, just read down to verse five,
[14:04] please.
[14:33] Amen. Amen.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; You know, for yourself know perfectly
[14:36] that the day of the Lord saw cometh as a
[14:39] thief in the night.
[14:45] Now, now in the Bible, we we we have the
[14:47] the first light which is supernatural
[14:54] and verse 14, we have the natural
[14:57] lights,
[15:01] natural lights.
[15:05] That's where we find we find the sun,
[15:08] the moon, the stars, and so forth.
[15:13] The Bible says it's for seasons.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; We have what the prophet calls the
[15:20] predestinated seasons
[15:25] and we have the natural seasons
[15:30] as we are the the bride is now in
[15:32] another season
[15:37] an an angelic season.
[15:41] angelic season.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; If we read here,
[15:50] &gt;&gt; um uh uh uh uh uh verse 14,
[15:54] &gt;&gt; verse 14,
[15:55] &gt;&gt; it says, "And God said, let there be
[15:57] lights in the firmament of the heaven,
[16:00] and to divide the day from the night,
[16:03] and let them be for signs, and for
[16:06] seasons, and for days, and years. Verse
[16:12] 14.
[16:25] Verse 15.
[16:34] Okay.
[16:35] Verse 16 also say, "And God made two
[16:38] great lights. the great light for the uh
[16:41] to rule the day and the lesser light to
[16:44] rule the night. He made the stars also.
[16:48] So all these things are for days and the
[16:52] seasons
[16:54] &gt;&gt; and the signs and years which is
[16:57] natural.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Earthly.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But re but but but Genesis 1:3
[17:05] says, "And God said, let there be light,
[17:08] and there was light." And and so God saw
[17:12] the light that it was good, and God
[17:14] divided the light from the darkness.
[17:23] So they were separated there,
[17:30] &gt;&gt; light and darkness
[17:36] and that was uh the first day.
[17:43] Now the first day of the week
[17:48] the Bible says here
[17:51] &gt;&gt; the first day of the week.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Now we will understand that we have a
[17:57] supernatural first day and we have a
[18:00] natural first day.
[18:07] Now they went to the tomb
[18:12] both naturally and spiritually.
[18:19] So they celebrated the the resurrection
[18:26] even up today
[18:29] but it's natural and spiritual.
[18:36] If you you look at the book of Mark 16,
[18:43] I I read this part here.
[18:47] Uh we read this in Congo and
[18:50] the people were happy.
[18:55] Chapter 16 says, I mean, yeah, chapter
[18:58] 16 verse 9.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Mark 16:9. Now when Jesus had risen
[19:03] early on the first day of the week,
[19:08] &gt;&gt; week is seven days.
[19:13] Now the first day of the week
[19:19] uh
[19:20] he appeared first to Mary Magdalene
[19:29] because Mary
[19:31] Magdalene type the church.
[19:37] So he appeared first not not to Peter
[19:41] and to or or to John but to Mary
[19:44] Magdalene.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; And we said last time in Congo the
[19:54] reason why he appeared to Mary Magdalene
[19:58] is because the Bible says out of whom he
[20:02] had cast seven demons.
[20:12] So it it it completely types the the
[20:14] seven church ages
[20:20] because the Lord has cast seven demons
[20:23] out of church ages
[20:28] seven church ages
[20:30] &gt;&gt; and now that church stands perfect
[20:32] before God as A BRIDE.
[20:39] AND THAT'S WHY NOW THE RESURRECTION is
[20:42] celebrated by this bride
[20:50] &gt;&gt; supernaturally.
[20:53] Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Now it says here, it says here,
[20:59] &gt;&gt; um,
[21:01] out of whom he had cast seven demons,
[21:07] And she went and told those who had been
[21:10] with him as they mourned and wept.
[21:18] The first person to announce the
[21:20] resurrection of the Lord was a woman.
[21:30] The first person to visit the tomb there
[21:34] or
[21:50] And the Bible says,
[21:53] "And 14, afterwards he appeared unto the
[21:56] 11 as they sat eating and
[22:00] braided them with their unbelief and
[22:04] hardness of heart. Because, listen,
[22:08] because they believed not those who had
[22:12] seen him after he had risen. Amen.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[22:39] Who are those?
[22:42] &gt;&gt; You are lost again.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene
[22:49] &gt;&gt; after the resurrection.
[22:52] He appeared unto Mary Magdalene.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Now shift from your head to your soul.
[23:04] Right.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says
[23:09] &gt;&gt; afterwards
[23:11] he appeared
[23:14] unto 11
[23:17] upraided them
[23:20] with their unbelief
[23:24] and the hardness of the heart.
[23:29] because they believed not those who had
[23:32] seen him after he had risen.
[23:42] Amen. Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we read there is another
[23:48] resurrection in our day
[23:54] and the people even today don't believe
[23:57] those who had seen him after the
[24:00] resurrection in the last days.
[24:07] Those who had seen him
[24:10] after the resurrection
[24:12] in our day
[24:16] Amen.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; For he said, "If a man believe me, I
[24:20] will raise him up at the last day."
[24:30] Now, uh if I may find that place,
[24:36] uh the prophet speaks of the
[24:38] resurrection in the last day.
[24:46] Amen.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; I'm trying not to read many things
[24:54] and uh so
[24:58] uh but I will read this part here
[25:03] speaking about the predestinated seed.
[25:10] Now, page 72, restoration of the bride.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Page 72, restoration of the bride.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; It is Easter again for the true
[25:18] believers
[25:24] of his never failing word.
[25:29] It's Easter. It's resurrection.
[25:34] God's got people everywhere.
[25:39] It's Easter for them.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; They have risen
[25:45] from this Christian denominations.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; It's Easter again.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; The royal seed has been has been hid in
[25:57] the roots.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; has been hid in the roots.
[26:06] has been hid in the roots.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; The word he the word heat back here in
[26:16] the way. Okay, let me turn to this now.
[26:19] It's Easter time
[26:23] &gt;&gt; predestinated from the foundation of the
[26:27] world.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; The church is beginning to stand.
[26:34] Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Now, uh we'll come back to this.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; But here the Bible says,
[26:47] &gt;&gt; uh I'm I'm back to the Thessalonians.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; I'm back to the Thessalonians.
[26:57] But of the times and the seasons,
[26:59] brethren, you have no need that I write
[27:02] unto you.
[27:08] Now I'll go back to say the first light
[27:11] was supernatural.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; And now while you are holding on that,
[27:19] Ephesians chapter 5
[27:22] &gt;&gt; tells me this.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; While you are holding on that,
[27:27] &gt;&gt; listen.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5 tells me this.
[27:32] Ephesians chapter 5.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; I will read this part here.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Uh verse 8,
[27:41] &gt;&gt; verse eight.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; For you were once darkness,
[27:48] &gt;&gt; but are now light.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; So when God spoke of darkness and light,
[27:57] you are speaking about people.
[28:07] the first light.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh now it spoke of east and
[28:14] west, evening and the morning.
[28:24] Amen. Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Referring to the evening people and the
[28:28] morning people.
[28:32] referring to the Gentiles and the Jews.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; And uh now now reading here,
[28:41] &gt;&gt; for you were once darkness,
[28:48] &gt;&gt; but now are you light in the Lord?
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Walk as children of light.
[28:58] the sons of light.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; It's light.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Now, back to Thessalonians.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Now, as the sons of light,
[29:15] you read here again
[29:19] verse four.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Verse four. But you brethren are not in
[29:23] darkness that that day should should
[29:26] overtake you as a thief.
[29:33] You you are all sons of
[29:37] light.
[29:41] Sons of the day,
[29:45] not this day.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and shoot and you are sons
[29:54] of the day. We we are not of night or of
[29:57] darkness.
[30:00] Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Therefore, let us not sleep as the
[30:03] others, but let us watch and be sober
[30:06] minded.
[30:11] For they that sleep sleep in the night.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; So, it's night time to some others here.
[30:20] in the night
[30:25] because a person
[30:27] uh for a person to sleep he needs
[30:30] darkness.
[30:37] So if you go you doze that means you are
[30:40] in darkness.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus appeared on the mountain.
[30:52] And uh the mountain was ablaze with
[30:56] light.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says Peter, John, and
[31:03] James slumbered.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Today to them it was this site was light
[31:14] and this sight WAS DARKNESS.
[31:20] SO they doze away
[31:24] and in the mountain there the Lord Jesus
[31:27] stood there with Moses and Elijah.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now h
[31:37] now now we have two these two places
[31:42] and now I'm I'm going to read some few
[31:45] things for you here.
[31:48] Because now it speaks of the evening
[31:51] light of restoration.
[31:56] And the prophet says
[31:59] evening light come to shine
[32:04] same as in the morning.
[32:08] Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know this this light
[32:13] shine is both for the people and its
[32:16] people
[32:23] &gt;&gt; as we we will see.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Now this evening lights will not rise in
[32:31] Jerusalem.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; The evening light goes where? IN THE
[32:38] WEST.
[32:43] AND THEY HAD THEIR day that is the east.
[32:46] They had their day in the east.
[32:51] They refused it.
[32:53] But now the evening light shall rise in
[32:55] the west.
[33:01] Now the Bible says the coming of the
[33:04] Lord,
[33:07] it is like lightning shining from the h
[33:11] one part of the earth to the other part.
[33:20] But now the prophet says it's now coming
[33:22] back east.
[33:28] Now that light in the east
[33:32] shineth also in the west
[33:37] that that's how a man TRAVELS
[33:43] and that's how the church travels
[33:48] east to WEST
[33:51] which is morning which is now east is
[33:54] morning.
[33:58] But if you you look in the Bible,
[34:02] it speaks of THE LAST
[34:05] WHICH is evening to morning
[34:11] because the last the last day.
[34:16] It's not morning and evening.
[34:20] The last day is evening AND MORNING.
[34:28] AND together
[34:31] they are called the evening light.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; The evening light means there's no more
[34:41] darkness.
[34:47] Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; And now we you read here.
[34:53] Now it will start from west now
[34:58] to Jerusalem.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; No, not not from Jerusalem to the
[35:04] uttermost.
[35:07] But it's now in the uttermost.
[35:11] It will start from the it will start
[35:13] from the uttermost to Jerusalem.
[35:18] So the prophet Elijah OF THE GENTILES
[35:24] THAT SPIRIT IS GOING back to Jerusalem.
[35:31] Amen. That that that's now it brings it
[35:35] back east.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Now when it comes back to east,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; it is now that evening light-
[35:49] &gt;&gt; which was the morning light.
[35:53] that traveled down to west
[35:56] and coming back again east.
[36:00] Now the whole thing is called the
[36:02] evening LIGHT
[36:07] which
[36:10] the seventh messenger tells you
[36:14] that is east and west.
[36:22] It's not now it's not two h parts or
[36:26] sides
[36:29] &gt;&gt; because the Jews and the Gentiles will
[36:32] now MEET
[36:36] and in the new Jerusalem
[36:40] we look at the foundation is Jewish
[36:46] &gt;&gt; and the whole building is gentile.
[36:50] and they share one light.
[36:58] That's why now Elijah of the Gentiles
[37:03] is going to the Jews.
[37:08] So it's one light traveling from the
[37:10] Gentiles to the Jews.
[37:16] that that same light
[37:19] traveled from the Jews to the GENTILES
[37:24] now at the end time is coming back east.
[37:30] But the thing is,
[37:33] how did it connect?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; This is what we were talking about on
[37:43] &gt;&gt; uh Thursday.
[37:48] H
[37:48] &gt;&gt; how did it connect?
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Because it is a connection of uh h the
[37:57] humans with the angels.
[38:04] Amen. Amen. That's why now
[38:10] uh the message of the hour
[38:13] has two parts.
[38:18] as you yourself have your theophony and
[38:22] your earthly dwelling place.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And we have realized that
[38:32] &gt;&gt; there are seven seals.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Seven seals were not written in the
[38:36] book.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the seven seals.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. as you can't see your your theoph
[38:55] seals
[39:00] &gt;&gt; and he stopped
[39:03] shut off the seventh seal.
[39:07] Now when the people get at that point
[39:10] they get lost.
[39:16] BECAUSE the prophet says,
[39:19] &gt;&gt; "What blinded Israel,
[39:23] &gt;&gt; what blinded Israel
[39:27] &gt;&gt; was that man?"
[39:31] Hallelujah.
[39:35] He says,
[39:37] &gt;&gt; "When people expected to see God
[39:42] and they were expecting to see God,
[39:46] they saw a manal."
[39:51] Then the whole thing blinded them.
[39:57] Hallelujah. [cheering]
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is in your book, The Unveiling
[40:02] of God.
[40:05] Unveiling of God.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "When they came to see
[40:09] God,
[40:11] they saw a man
[40:15] &gt;&gt; and that blinded them."
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says,
[40:26] &gt;&gt; "When he opened the seventh seal,
[40:32] It was all silent.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And now the Gentiles are blind.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Because
[40:48] as they are coming, as they come to see
[40:51] God,
[40:55] &gt;&gt; they are blinded by a man.
[41:01] Hallelujah.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Uh the blindness is that
[41:08] God came down
[41:11] into a man
[41:15] and revealed the seals.
[41:21] Amen. Now what blinds them is
[41:26] they
[41:28] they they are expecting the seals to be
[41:31] revealed.
[41:36] But the thing is
[41:38] how God reveals them.
[41:45] This is this this is the thing that
[41:47] blinds them.
[41:54] Hallelujah.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; They were expecting Moses to deliver
[41:57] they were expecting Jehovah to deliver
[41:59] them out of Egypt.
[42:06] Amen. Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; But when he came to deliver them,
[42:12] the Bible says they didn't believe
[42:15] Moses.
[42:20] Hallelujah.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Because the the form of men blended
[42:24] them.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; God had to take now someh kilometers in
[42:36] order to bring them as he went now for
[42:39] Pharaoh.
[42:44] He went to Pharaoh.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says
[42:52] &gt;&gt; they didn't believe Moses.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Even here after the resurrection,
[43:03] they didn't believe.
[43:08] Those who say came and and said to them,
[43:11] "We have seen the Lord."
[43:16] To them,
[43:18] he was buried.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; He's dead.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; To them, he was dead.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; So, he had to go some extra
[43:33] &gt;&gt; kilometers to to bring them to
[43:35] Jerusalem.
[43:40] Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we are reading here.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Now the evening light is here to
[43:48] restore.
[43:52] Amen. Amen. And
[43:55] that is for the for the evening people.
[44:01] I will go this way now.
[44:04] Now
[44:06] as as the the the seventh seal
[44:11] &gt;&gt; is was the coming of the Lord
[44:17] &gt;&gt; to to the bride.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Now I I'm going to take it from this
[44:24] now.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[44:34] Now the reason the reason here
[44:40] as a Thursday here we we we went that
[44:45] that far
[44:48] how a pastor said to me
[44:55] I now understand
[44:58] the reason why the prophet was supposed
[45:02] to go rest.
[45:09] Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; But let let me read it to you again.
