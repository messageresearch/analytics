[9:56] amen we may take your SE God bless you
[10:00] and well
[10:05] um
[10:08] we we are going to read the word of
[10:13] God the one that people used to say is
[10:21] dangerous this message we preach is a
[10:23] dangerous
[10:25] message
[10:27] amen now
[10:30] we thank
[10:34] God that in all the things that he has
[10:37] done for us
[10:42] [Music]
[10:44] okay me and my brother will
[10:46] just and uh so um he's a a brother
[10:57] [Music]
[11:01] I've known since ever he worked for what
[11:06] was
[11:08] it magistrate neor neor amen amen
[11:13] amen he was still a young man unmarried
[11:17] amen and uh so we thank God today
[11:20] Hallelujah uh God is now being saved by
[11:25] The Offspring amen okay so uh
[11:30] we we I
[11:34] sometimes we think that this is the last
[11:40] message from
[11:45] God then we wonder again next time there
[11:48] is another
[11:53] service now the prophet
[11:55] says he spoke of the last sheep
[12:01] and he spoke also of something here
[12:04] maybe I will find it if I can
[12:09] page uh where he
[12:12] says
[12:13] um if the church only knew its
[12:20] position and he says it will one
[12:25] day then the Rapture will go
[12:31] so
[12:33] um this is uh keeping our
[12:38] time or it's our time
[12:44] piece if the church only knew its
[12:51] position amen am uh now sometimes we go
[12:56] out
[12:59] or to
[13:02] evangelize uh and
[13:04] but yet we should know our
[13:10] position amen amen we we we should know
[13:13] who we
[13:15] are where we are where are we going
[13:20] where we came
[13:22] from amen amen so if the
[13:26] church H only knew is
[13:32] position and the Rapture will
[13:37] go so
[13:39] um what's keeping the Rapture not to
[13:46] go it's something um in the bride of
[13:52] Christ okay
[13:55] amen let me read to you what I'm going
[13:57] to speak of
[14:00] uh the prophet
[14:03] says now all right let me start by
[14:06] reading this
[14:08] part we are we are we are just going
[14:10] briefly to talk about something
[14:14] here um I'm glad I believe a brother was
[14:20] introduced this
[14:25] morning and uh the brother who came and
[14:28] said said I want to serve my God
[14:34] now and I've been
[14:38] away because you know if you are a child
[14:40] of
[14:42] God uh you can go very
[14:46] far but God will
[14:49] still restore
[14:51] you amen
[14:53] amen so that's why we as the children of
[14:57] God
[14:59] we judge no
[15:01] [Music]
[15:02] man the judge is
[15:06] God uh if somebody comes and say I'm
[15:11] sick we don't ask him
[15:15] questions where do you
[15:17] worship there's a mother I don't know
[15:23] if I don't think she's
[15:25] here she she came yesterday was with
[15:32] brother and uh she was the last person
[15:35] to to see us last
[15:39] night um and she said she's got a neck
[15:44] problem
[15:46] and our Deon knows about
[15:50] it so I said said you are I said you are
[15:56] a a Pentecostal and he said yes and
[15:59] she she she she
[16:02] prayed for her
[16:05] condition so I pray for
[16:09] her amen amen because in praying for the
[16:14] sick uh you don't pray for somebody who
[16:17] is with you in the
[16:22] faith you don't only pray for that
[16:26] particular
[16:27] person because he's with you in
[16:31] the you pray for
[16:34] everybody amen amen so and a prayer of
[16:40] faith but I'm glad I don't know if this
[16:43] mama that Mama is
[16:45] here but when she
[16:47] left then she she she she she turned
[16:52] this way and that
[16:56] way amen amen said God bless you
[17:01] m amen amen um so there is power in the
[17:08] word brother
[17:11] says the word of God is your
[17:16] healer amen amen
[17:20] then there was another sister
[17:25] yesterday H she
[17:27] came and
[17:30] uh I as
[17:35] brother I W reveal the sister I don't
[17:38] know if she's in or
[17:40] not but she promised that if she can
[17:43] find her way she'll be
[17:47] here but so I said to
[17:52] brother I want you to take a photo of my
[17:55] sister here
[17:59] saw that uh you as a
[18:03] witness uh
[18:06] tomorrow you'll be able to
[18:10] testify that we prayed for this
[18:14] sister in such a
[18:16] condition and today she is in this
[18:21] condition I said because we have prayed
[18:24] for so many
[18:26] people with some kind of
[18:30] diseases and people don't
[18:35] know the conditions the people were
[18:38] found to
[18:40] be and they are today
[18:44] perect and there's no witness to
[18:48] that so this day we need to have a
[18:52] witness every
[18:55] time just as brother bam did
[19:01] amen amen so uh God bless you this is
[19:05] what I'm trying to talk
[19:07] about God dwells in the sture of a
[19:13] man now let me read it to
[19:16] you because you know uh before you can
[19:20] worship
[19:21] God you should know who he
[19:25] is and where he is
[19:29] because if you don't know where God
[19:32] is you can just bow on your knees
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] anywhere and that's why the Lord Jesus
[19:41] said to the
[19:44] Samaritan you worship but you don't know
[19:49] why because salvation is of the
[19:53] Jews so that means they worship in vain
[19:58] but he said but now the time has
[20:02] come and the true worshippers shall
[20:05] worship
[20:06] God not upon that
[20:09] mountain not in
[20:11] Jerusalem but they worship God in
[20:16] spirit amen amen so here it says here I
[20:21] I'm it's a quotation from the stature of
[20:24] a perfect man from the St of the perfect
[20:27] man amen amen now a perfect
[20:33] man brother says as we were taught that
[20:38] Perfection is in
[20:44] three three is the number of
[20:49] perfection then in my Hebrew Book I
[20:52] don't
[20:53] have he says life is in the thir
[20:59] [Music]
[21:01] amen amen then he goes to book of
[21:04] Genesis chapter
[21:07] 1 he says
[21:10] chapter I mean that is verse
[21:14] three h he speaks of how God coming down
[21:19] separating water from
[21:22] water Darkness from
[21:25] light then finally he reached the dry
[21:30] ground and he said let the Earth bring
[21:35] forth and uh
[21:37] so uh he quotes also verse
[21:41] 11 yeah that is verse
[21:44] 11 and it says let every tree or plant
[21:48] bring forth of its
[21:53] kind amen amen so uh that that's life
[22:00] coming
[22:01] down but let me read this thing because
[22:05] he
[22:06] says
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] um how he puts it this he puts it this
[22:13] way that the seed was in the
[22:18] earth amen but it was not yet
[22:23] called but it was already
[22:26] there you see amen and it is in your
[22:30] book I don't have it but I will qu
[22:36] it if you read
[22:39] Genesis uh he speaks of this
[22:42] here and chapter
[22:46] one I'll have
[22:51] you okay just hold on chapter one
[22:55] chapter one now uh verse
[23:00] 11 verse 11 he it says and God said let
[23:05] the Earth bring forth vegetations they
[23:08] have yielding seed and fruit tree
[23:11] yielding fruit after its kind whose seed
[23:15] is in itself upon the Earth and it was s
[23:25] [Music]
[23:34] amen amen so now the prophet says
[23:38] because the
[23:40] seeds were were already there the SE was
[23:44] already
[23:46] there it was only waiting
[23:50] for the time of it
[23:54] calling amen amen so h but the title I
[24:00] want to
[24:03] give please you write the thing that I'm
[24:06] going to
[24:09] read okay H I will read two things
[24:14] here one
[24:16] says God dwells in the nature in the
[24:19] stature of a
[24:23] man that's one number one and I have one
[24:29] part also to read to
[24:32] you all right I think it's somewhere
[24:36] here uh uh
[24:39] uh all right amen I've got it here with
[24:43] me yeah here you are God dwells in the
[24:47] sture of a
[24:51] man then this one says that is cod page
[24:56] 1 page now if if we can
[25:01] find out what God
[25:05] is we can find what kind of man he has
[25:14] made all right amen now in the book of
[25:19] adoption there he
[25:21] says uh everything will come back to be
[25:25] Jesus again
[25:29] amen amen now let me just quote these
[25:31] things to
[25:34] you because the Bible say here
[25:41] say
[25:43] and verse 8 verse 8 and being found in
[25:49] fashion as a man
[26:00] amen
[26:02] amen uh verse S he says but made himself
[26:06] of no reputation took upon him the form
[26:10] of a servant and was made in the
[26:12] likeness of men
[26:21] am verse 8 and being found in fashion as
[26:26] a man verse verse eight
[26:34] says verse S okay okay
[26:38] maybe verses don't correspond I don't
[26:41] know okay amen all right
[26:50] amen we just trying to lay the amen
[26:58] this old man when he starts in the
[27:00] morning he says I lay the carpet he
[27:02] first starts with the
[27:07] POR then when he gets to work that's
[27:11] when we are trying
[27:14] toay he was found to be in
[27:21] F of a man amen amen H then more
[27:31] I come
[27:33] down he was a
[27:38] man it start by
[27:40] [Music]
[27:42] saying God is a
[27:46] man then I repeat see God is a
[27:51] man so therefore it proves
[27:56] it when God came down to dwell among
[28:01] us he was a
[28:06] man God dwells in the St
[28:12] of that
[28:14] means H when he came
[28:19] down and uh when he reached
[28:23] us he was a man
[28:27] [Applause]
[28:29] that's why even in the end
[28:31] time we have the seventh angel
[28:36] messenger when the seals reached
[28:40] us it was a
[28:43] man amen
[28:47] amen when God reach
[28:51] Phillip then he was a
[28:56] man so now there
[28:58] why you will realize
[29:01] that many people could not accept or
[29:06] believe
[29:10] him because they had a certain
[29:15] mentality about
[29:18] God so when he reached
[29:21] them he was a man okay Amen in this
[29:26] way uh
[29:28] um and they don't love
[29:33] him when he
[29:40] becomes they just want him to be a
[29:45] God uh a god they can worship without
[29:49] even knowing where he
[29:53] is but when he embodied
[29:56] himself then
[29:58] this is the thing they don't
[30:02] like amen
[30:04] [Music]
[30:09] amen let Meo it I was told that even
[30:15] yesterday they didn't want me to come
[30:17] there to the dedicational
[30:22] service amen amen but I said to the
[30:26] brother they can't stop
[30:30] me
[30:33] okay so uh let me read you another thing
[30:38] here
[30:39] um yeah I'm I'm on a ghost
[30:44] low but not a
[30:48] strike not striking
[30:51] amen the the the the people the Jesus
[30:55] was masked to these Greeks
[31:03] amen amen so when they come to him he
[31:06] was
[31:10] mask and and they couldn't
[31:15] understand why that they couldn't see
[31:20] him because they came thinking that God
[31:24] would be this or that
[31:28] but only when they
[31:30] arrived there stood a
[31:33] man this is the unveiling of
[31:36] God page 17 Page 1 they come to see
[31:41] God they've seen a
[31:48] man what do they come for to see
[31:51] God
[31:55] disappointed saying I'm coming to see
[31:57] God
[32:13] must it will be such a
[32:16] great and when you got there you find
[32:19] aen amen amen hallelujah
[32:28] they they disappointed the Jews very it
[32:30] disappointed the
[32:32] Jews because uh they always thought
[32:36] themselves to be the children of the
[32:41] promise and they thought they would see
[32:44] God but when God arrived on the
[32:47] seene he was a
[32:51] man that that that was the the that's
[32:54] where the whole trouble problem started
[32:59] we want to see God not a
[33:04] man this je thought like
[33:08] that then you read John 6 John where he
[33:13] says
[33:15] I'm a bread from
[33:19] heaven
[33:20] and they were around him
[33:24] there but uh after making that state
[33:31] said listen to him now amen I'm the
[33:34] bread
[33:37] from
[33:40] then let me read it for
[33:44] you we are not in
[33:48] h is there anyone who's going to
[33:57] Church
[34:00] in the P so
[34:06] much he just come to
[34:08] church and say brothers and sisters
[34:12] hallelujah our national team is playing
[34:16] today they need our
[34:19] support and our
[34:21] prayers amen amen amen hallelujah say
[34:25] Amen then
[34:28] he open the
[34:30] scriptures because in his
[34:33] mind there
[34:37] is so he will just read for the sake of
[34:41] reading and say Jesus loved the world
[34:45] and he also loved the
[34:49] footballer then 15 minutes 15 minutes
[34:53] let us pray so that the people can get
[34:55] chance to see
[34:59] amen amen then when the Sun goes down
[35:02] the people are sick because has
[35:08] lost after his
[35:11] prayers okay amen so God bless you now
[35:15] here we are h i I will read this part
[35:20] that is John chapter 6 Johan 6
[35:23] [Music]
[35:24] um verse 38 verse 38 I came down from
[35:29] heaven not to do my own will but the
[35:32] will of him that sent
[35:40] me amen amen and uh
[35:46] H verse verse 41 I'm going to verse 4
[35:52] the Jews then mured at him because he
[35:55] said I am the bread that came down from
[36:05] heaven all right
[36:08] amen he was Healing The
[36:12] Sick they were following him
[36:16] but declaration now when the Declaration
[36:19] came the Bible says no man has seen God
[36:22] at any
[36:24] time but only the begotten
[36:33] amen amen he saw Here I Am from
[36:38] heaven then they
[36:40] mured at him because he said I am the
[36:44] bread that came down from
[36:48] heaven and they said is not this
[36:52] Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and
[36:56] mother we know
[36:59] how is it then that he said I came down
[37:01] from
[37:03] heaven amen amen and Jesus therefore
[37:07] answered and said unto
[37:10] them remember not among
[37:14] yourself no man can come to
[37:19] me amen amen uh he showed them the
[37:25] distance they've been there around
[37:29] but they couldn't come to
[37:34] him it is just like if you are in this
[37:37] place
[37:40] physically phally amen amen and yet you
[37:45] at the end of it
[37:47] all you have failed to come to
[37:51] God you were just here in the
[37:55] vinity amen amen but you never went
[38:00] further and reach
[38:03] God the reason been that man is
[38:08] triti H now inside of
[38:12] you there
[38:14] is it's a
[38:17] bodyside the
[38:20] spirit the
[38:22] soul amen amen now inside of you
[38:27] uh there is a
[38:30] way from your
[38:34] mind down to your
[38:37] soul that's how you can
[38:41] travel amen amen and now to reach
[38:46] God you've got to travel as the prophet
[38:50] says you come it comes down the
[38:54] mind when the word of God comes to you
[38:58] and the mind
[39:01] catches but it has to go down to the
[39:06] soul amen amen when it is in the
[39:10] mind it is
[39:13] theology you can't go
[39:16] further that's where theology is coming
[39:20] from that's where denomination is coming
[39:23] from the word of God stops in the
[39:30] then you start to
[39:34] think don't understand this one I won't
[39:37] take I'll take this one that is in the
[39:40] mind but once it drops
[39:44] in uh I've got a book
[39:47] here I can read it quickly once it drops
[39:52] in then it's something
[39:56] different or okay if I don't have it
[39:59] here no problem I will qu it to you amen
[40:04] amen so now you see these things as we
[40:07] are carrying on
[40:09] reading H the prophet speaks of
[40:12] this
[40:14] that okay Amen Let Me Maybe it's around
[40:18] here I I'll catch it quickly amen he
[40:22] speaks of these
[40:24] things how it's coming down your mind
[40:29] to your
[40:31] soul yeah it's something here amen okay
[40:35] uh I will read it where let me find the
[40:39] the
[40:41] position or the the page am which I
[40:44] don't remember in which
[40:46] page
[40:50] okay are we together Hallelujah all
[40:53] right it's a marked page I will find it
[40:56] I think amen
[40:59] your faith here in this in this book
[41:02] your
[41:04] faith I won't surrender I'll find
[41:08] it yeah he
[41:11] says
[41:13] um I could preach the
[41:17] word you could accept
[41:20] it and say that's all
[41:23] right I believe
[41:25] that well if that's all the further it
[41:30] ever goes then you'll never get very far
[41:33] with
[41:39] God you hear the
[41:42] message and you say I believe
[41:46] it but if is the further it can
[41:53] go he says you won't go far with God
[41:59] why because it's not just to say I
[42:02] believe
[42:03] it it's for the way to to be made
[42:10] manifest amen amen by just saying I
[42:14] believe you won't go far with
[42:19] God amen
[42:22] amen like what I said last
[42:25] night ifuse say I say to you do believe
[42:31] that there is
[42:32] communion and the Lord
[42:34] supper and you say sure
[42:36] amen but if you don't partake so you
[42:40] don't go far with
[42:41] God why because that word must be
[42:47] manifested and brother Bram says we know
[42:50] that is the word of God
[42:54] manifestation it's when that way
[42:58] is is f is being
[43:01] fulfilled it's
[43:03] manifested Amen so it's not just to say
[43:07] I believe
[43:08] it but is to leave
[43:11] it to act
[43:13] it become that
[43:16] way amen
[43:19] amen then you are with
[43:22] God because God said let there be light
[43:26] and they were was
[43:29] light so if he say
[43:32] something and you do it so you are you
[43:36] are together with
[43:39] God but if you just believe it you are
[43:43] not together with him you just
[43:46] believe amen amen so here we
[43:51] are uh it
[43:54] says then you'll never get very far with
[43:58] God it's intellectual
[44:02] Faith that's the reason people doesn't
[44:05] get
[44:08] healed is because they only have an
[44:11] intellectual view of
[44:16] it amen
[44:20] amen Jesus heals but it should be made
[44:27] be
[44:29] manifested amen if you come
[44:32] here and say I'm
[44:34] sick and you believe that Jesus
[44:39] saves now you must come here to accept
[44:42] that
[44:46] healing if you believe that H he heals
[44:50] the
[44:52] sick now you must come and manifest it
[44:59] amen you know uh one day
[45:04] we I
[45:07] prayed for
[45:09] a a sister from
[45:13] so she was brought to my
[45:17] house she couldn't
[45:19] walk and told me that she was Bewitched
[45:23] by her aunt something like that
[45:28] okay they help her walked her
[45:31] into my
[45:33] house now I said to her now I'm going to
[45:37] preach for you to pray for
[45:40] you if you believe you'll be
[45:45] healed if you can believe because I
[45:49] believe now you also Must
[45:53] Believe amen amen then why why was
[45:59] talking H she asked for the
[46:03] restroom and uh I I could see
[46:07] that she was managed to stand up on
[46:14] herself but the
[46:16] husband still mindful
[46:22] of yes and uh he he tried to to hold
[46:28] her and I said no just leave
[46:31] here but anyhow he
[46:35] insisted because that thing was
[46:39] still that if he she can try to do it
[46:43] she will drop down so I have to help so
[46:47] I just left them like
[46:49] that by the time we finished I prayed
[46:53] for her and as they walked out
[46:57] she could
[46:58] walk amen amen now the thing
[47:01] is before I prayed for
[47:05] her already she was
[47:08] healed
[47:11] why she believed the word
[47:14] I I spoke to
[47:18] her the healer is the
[47:25] word for
[47:28] [Music]
