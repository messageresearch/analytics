Description:
This message was preached by pastor Israel Nkodima on 26 December 2016 at The Final voice tabernacle in Kempton Park South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the translation of the bride of Christ. The Pastor read Revelation 22:6 “And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.”
‭‭
He further reads Genesis‬ ‭18‬:‭9‬-‭15‬“And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.”

He also read Genesis‬ ‭21‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭KJV‬‬ “And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] amen amen do you believe brother yes that sister testified to me I believe now it's going down they haven't yet believed him they haven't seen him so when the Samaritans were come unto him that is there two days because government is now him the woman has stopped her testimony and testimony brought them to him I mean some people sometimes hang around somebody who has testified to them when they leave the church they also leave the church uh-huh he becomes their object of worship it says and said unto the woman now we believe and the Bible say they believed on him for the same of the woman they come to the next category now they tend to their testify he should not be following them and saying I told you this and this and that they said okay thank you Hallelujah okay we have believed your testimony but since we have come to him amen amen and said unto the woman and let me carry on that is best 42 42. now we believe not because of thy saying we have moved on from what you have said to us it has moved on to ourselves amen [Applause] [Applause] fall we have heard him ourselves amen amen I believe what the seventh seal is we believe it because we have heard him remove Queen hours [Applause] is be manifested in my heart was revealed in the heart of the messenger yeah and he was given the book for the Bible says when he sounds his trumpets all the mystery of God that that trumpets yeah denotes all the mysteries of God those who have hated himself they are not asking questions they are the manifestation of that message they are the ministry themselves being manifested amen Elisha came back and Lisa as a manifestation somebody appreciated the prophet some people thanking God for sending Elijah the prophets was an inward believer I mean he said as the Lord leaves I will not remain I don't only just want to be here I don't want to be uh I want to be a possessori I don't need professional positions and he followed Elijah of our day until we cross over and they're over there then the people on the other side I didn't hear what was taking place over there amen foreign [Applause] it was a man called a man used by God so much oh unfortunately God took him there was such a man the ministry of God has to cross over so that when the people look at the people the manifestation of the people who came from Beyond the spirit of Elijah amen amen so Joan it was the same Ministry amen Joshua was still Moses now in the form of Joshua it was still Moses she was still the ministry God put it into Joshua amen amen for the people what about to follow and manifest the ministry that was given to brother Branham we need to receive uh you can't take the people always as another spirit amen amen amen God just disconnected it he connected it to Joshua will I connected you shall cause the people to cross nothing shall stand before I may still the same Ministry I mean now let's see then otherwise look at it you know I won't I'm not going to belong let me read it let me read this listen to the man of God we are looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed because this one is promised he couldn't come through the old system because in Isaac more Isaac shall they sit be called she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins she could not have the baby amen let this sink a bit this condition she could not have a baby there was a promise episode amen she put us he put aside my aim and look to the promise God changed back to change her to a young woman he did Abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as Dead [Music] all he had two change the body in order to receive the promised Son of God [Music] amen it is not just to say Jesus can throw which body I don't know amen amen now that's why the people are confused because he came through the same channel [Music] now let's look at it and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies Paul says for we shall not all sleep and we shall all be changed amen amen amen God has again introduced a channel that is channel the sun to us [Music] [Music] but the new body that comes from this born again now do you see the new body and they are new body this new body is not after our death amen that comes from this born again not the first conscience is that in such something that leaves now we are talking about us now we are going back to Sarah now we are talking about you should be changed now that this doesn't speak of after death everybody understands and it is not this outside it's subject to death [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] now are you listening a person that cannot bow yeah [Applause] Now you listen because this is that is coming water who cannot die amen now a place must be prepared a son who cannot die to occupy a body that can look down [Music] amen and that's the person at that the New Life Starts from Tomorrow the new life don't start after you are dead it should be here right now from this New Path builds another person in the image of the person amen [Applause] amen so if you are predestinated there is in you another person amen if you are predestinated oh I don't have another book here don't worry I'll coach did you know that even scientists has science has discovered that there is another person in you know amen that one has his own senses you get what I mean and but this one has his own senses now let me read it and a new bed and it builds another person in the image of this person you are amen amen so potentially really it's in here what it is the way the promise before the foundation of the world that word promise in the beginning was the word and the weight was with God and the way it was that was the beginning of the unfolding God has no beginning but in the beginning the Bible says and we saw his glory I mean working Among Us ually because this beginning Karma tomorrow is not Material like genesis that beginning it says in the beginning God created foreign amen [Music] amen the beginning of Genesis was the beginning of the creation there was any creation there was that beginning which is the unfolding amen amen it didn't begin there it was God the spirit condescended into a logos and out of the logos came forth the men [Music] now this man is there before there was creation and I was brought down into creation a child of God is nothing else but is the word of God as it is God's thoughts is the mind of God being manifested that's called a Christian um we are not religionists we are Christians can do anything he wants as long as it is in the name of Jesus I said yesterday people are doing things in the name of brother Brennan Brothers they confuse the people are confused about people without revelation you can say something and say um foreign [Music] but you can't do that to a son of God because I will tell you straight there he says or in those days they used to call them flippers they cross their head like that he says today it's a breeding is foreign they don't go further I'm actually they end up with pretty teeth [Music] then after that beauty is [Applause] you see you must take the whole thing from the prophet not the part of it [Applause] write it what you need to get attracted to pull him to the next person now comes the Son of God because he is that word he will read the whole chapter he is since I saw them they packed today but he is in his people and we can see his glory we see the ministers ah let's look give me one second let me go back again says he was the other part of the contract when he was here God moved things in heaven he brought them to Adam having said nothing the Earthly [Music] so the god of the earth contract with the god of the universe I mean so when it comes down now you tell when you want to know the secrets you have to wait by the sight of Adam doing that every secret that is in in heaven this man will reveal it [Applause] I mean you don't have a revelation that is flying in the air foreign foreign [Music] oh man can I spend 15 minutes amen listen so potentially potential is in here and what it is lucky the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative yeah all winterfella negative this body that will reflect the positive well the whole ones are positive and the same thing you're not true or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing listen now the weight this is how it comes the word that's in you know the body will materialize around that word [Applause] in heaven and the same thing did by Sarah now here we are talking about an inside job here yes [Music] I mean a man and this body cannot do it so it will have to be changed [Applause] it let me read the Bible and the Bible will tell us the true story while we are here turn also to your book Hebrews Hebrews chapter 11 chapter 11 verse 11. amen chapter 11 verse 11 11 by Hebrew chapter 11 verse 11 he who has it and read in English through Sarah also sorry true Faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen okay amen although I read this yesterday we'll say this again how it was channeled because if you read verse and what Hebrew what does verses verse 8 verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went okay amen now we headed yesterday Pastor a bit of it says by faith Abraham come over by the verse 11 says [Music] now this time is Not By Faith because the faith is that of Abraham and the wife it says yes this is not a woman he called Abraham my Lord through faith of Abraham showing that Elijah operated through the faith of Abraham [Applause] but with Abraham by faith I mean with us the bride right is through the face of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the Bible says we operate through his face okay amen I will pass that because now God is going to bring seed in Isaac shall the seed be called kaisan all right now we're trying to put it together yeah Joseph was not mentioned before it happened God asked Joseph to excuse foreign and became blood yeah somebody will believe it when that word hell into Layla by Gabriel yeah when it was given to a vision yes and said be and be it unto me what it means she's she firstly she thought I how can I have a baby amen but when the inside the Revelation started to build up then she corrected herself be it unto me amen amen not according to my understanding not according to my knowledge because I will depends on the way that you have spoken if the seven seal is open and he said nothing when he said that when she said the seed has been planted amen and Gabriel turned well around the will of God has been done the seed has been planted the sun will come forth now and Sarah started to feel things amen he used to go to collect water with some other women but you still wondering how come the Lord come to me I mean so it was building up a body for God [Music] and when that child was born he distanced himself from any other it would be parents foreign [Applause] and verse 11 now Abraham no I I quoted that one Hebrews it cease to be no verse 11. true Faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age amen amen when she was when she was when it was impossible for a woman foreign as we have passed amen amen when she passed age the operation was now God fulfilling his way I'm in so that giving Sarah or lesser could not boasts now as you go to chapter 18 of Genesis [Music] now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the men of women amen amen are you with us it seized to be with sir she was beyond that okay [Music] an old woman manner of women she was sort of just waiting for the whisker while image failure so that she can go to rest what are you good but at that time there was a visitation amen God wants you when you are at your last time amen God comes when the dog the doctor said you won't leave amen he likes that Gap in order to come and jump in and say I am the life just to remain a physician to remind a physician that the life it's me the doctor sentenced you to dance yeah when Lazarus was dead he came in he laughed that he came after he was dead [Applause] when Lazarus is alive and also to display his power look like he said he wanted to a situation is the resurrection I mean now he could not share the resurrection with death that's why he came with Lazarus the spirit Lazarus Lazarus he came to the tomb of Lazarus which is the remains part of the family but Lazarus was in him [Applause] amen to reconnect the spirit and that body amen [Applause] oh he just reconnected the thing we are not connected foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] 21. he he for he said oh my let me run it here verse 9 of Genesis 18 says and they said unto him where is and he said behold in the attention now listen to the second one and he said verse 9 says they said foreign [Music] early in the morning a place where he stood before the Lord and he looked to us the Lord the smoke of the country went up as the smoke uh of a furnace maybe you didn't hear it verse chapter 18 chapter 18 verse 20. Moses and the Lord said because The Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know and they maintain their faces amen amen that was the third pool says that was the third pool in the house of Abraham because the sun came to the house of Abraham the seventh seals came to the house of Abraham now watch Abraham Abraham stood yet his ministry comes up to that yeah then the Bible says the next morning he came back to the same place can go back to where I stood with the Lord I'll be able to see amen so when he came there next morning especially knowing what was going to happen he stood at the same place good job amen did you know that after the Rapture camera we will stand somewhere when we will see things that comes after amen we will see what what will take place amen [Music] amen I'm so glad I'm one of them amen somewhere with the Lord yeah we will look down these things for he said I shall not hide from Abraham but what I want to you to look at secretary verse chapter 21 Genesis hold on for a while and the Lord visited Sarah as he has said I mean I mean now here he doesn't speak of Abraham it's just he said I shall return I will return the ministry went to Sarah now concentration amen did you ever went to attend a wedding alone I mean the concentration is always on the right amen the man you can put the best suit or watch against a Dancer the people don't care about them they say oh look at that dress the concentration is on the female now here we see God himself concentrating on the woman amen because a man cannot conceive so I mean it should come from the Menace the whole concentrations are you listening friends and if she's become so important even if she comes in today because they can see that she's very important it's two people in one okay so they always say it's sorry for Mama their concentration is now on the bride that's why even today the concentration is the manifestation of the seed where they preached by the prophets Amish says Jesus just believed in what the way they say amen he is you too I lose amen amen amen and when they come to join like I would just say who are you he said I am the voice [Music] of the one crying in the wilderness chapter 8 chapter 8. amen we cannot teach Who We Are and Jesus preached who he is and the Lord this is amen amen I'm trying to drive you to a place you should be changed amen and yes you are your body is old outside [Applause] cannot see the seventh seals which should be a changed actually to say he's a new person is not to say he started there he was newly introduced he's been there before but as he was now introduced Sarah in his mission that means if you look at him at the same time of which God had spoken amen amen and even there's something again when Abraham died how old was he I'm trying to read it here we'll find it find it for me when Abraham died how old was he you don't know because you didn't attend the funeral chapter 25 verse 7. amen follow it chapter 25 verse 7 and these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived in in 103 score and 15 years then Abraham died in a good old age an old man full of years and yet after God has changed him I mean so there was something another person in abrahamas still bring children but yet when they look at him he was still old when the people look at you you are still aging [Applause] amen I mean the Lord has to change you first amen [Applause] amen amen because people would suggest to look for a young um didn't they say he has changed this one is still old an old man cannot preach the Seven Seals an old man cannot reach the third truth [Applause] an old man will deny that the seventh seal is an older man an older man would be able to see the Deadpool that is an old man an old man who would disbelief announcements about the clouds [Music] they left the place it formed a cloud [Music] old men cannot see that [Applause] because an old man can't see far you get what I mean [Applause] there is [Applause] [Music] put on [Music]
