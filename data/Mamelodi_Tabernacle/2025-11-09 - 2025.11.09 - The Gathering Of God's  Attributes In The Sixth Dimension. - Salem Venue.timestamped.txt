[1:21:03] the best of my ability.
[1:21:08] Yeah. So um it says
[1:21:11] Reverend Israel of Tabernacle
[1:21:17] in Ptoria has gone to be with the Lord
[1:21:19] on Ptoria
[1:21:23] on Thursday morning 30 October.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; His church is one of the largest message
[1:21:30] church in South Africa.
[1:21:35] a church that exists for almost 50
[1:21:38] years.
[1:21:41] Pastor Kodima was recognized or um was
[1:21:45] noticed by his profound teaching on the
[1:21:47] revelation of the seven seals.
[1:21:54] and the mystery of the son of man.
[1:21:59] He has left behind.
[1:22:03] A huge number of believers.
[1:22:07] His departure has saddened many
[1:22:09] believers in South Africa and around the
[1:22:11] world.
[1:22:16] He was one of the eldest message
[1:22:18] believer in South Africa.
[1:22:24] He believed the message in the early7s
[1:22:30] after coming across the spoken word, the
[1:22:32] god of this evil age.
[1:22:38] He has dedicated his life
[1:22:41] to the preaching of this message
[1:22:45] and has traveled around the world in
[1:22:47] many countries in Africa.
[1:22:54] May he so rest in peace.
[1:22:57] Thank you.
[1:23:05] Amen. He becomes another person.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
[1:23:17] So, we've got the lost and found here.
[1:23:21] We've got a cell phone
[1:23:24] and then we've got classes.
[1:23:28] You can come to me after service
[1:23:32] then we can be able to give it to you.
[1:23:34] Amen.
[1:23:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we are coming to a very crucial
[1:23:39] time.
[1:23:42] The time of the word of the Lord.
[1:23:45] I will request my pastor, pastor Maka
[1:23:50] to
[1:23:52] approach the pullpit.
[1:23:55] He will know what to do from here.
[1:24:01] Let me see whether
[1:24:16] Okay, we've got the message from
[1:24:18] Tanzania.
[1:24:21] Our brother will just read it.
[1:24:26] God bless you believers.
[1:24:29] Greetings from Tanzania from Pastor
[1:24:32] Shija and the saints. H another home
[1:24:36] church of Pastor Anodim.
[1:24:38] The pastor says he is very sorry and
[1:24:43] say may the father in heaven comfort all
[1:24:47] of you with his grace and love. The
[1:24:52] pastor says it's very hard and
[1:24:56] and sad but we have to accept what God
[1:25:01] has has done. He loves you all. God
[1:25:05] bless you all.
[1:25:07] Hallelujah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; I think we've got another
[1:25:16] announcement.
[1:25:26] Okay, we've got one from Botswana.
[1:25:30] H my memory of Pastor Israelima.
[1:25:34] Reflections from Kabaroni Botswana.
[1:25:37] Greetings to pastor's family and Madori
[1:25:41] tabernacle. In the name of the Lord
[1:25:43] Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. We
[1:25:46] received with heavy hearts and grief the
[1:25:49] news of the passing away of Pastor
[1:25:52] Israelima.
[1:25:54] If it were by our will, this notable
[1:25:57] teacher of the lifegiving message should
[1:26:01] have continued in the land of the
[1:26:04] living. However, God's will is even
[1:26:07] mightier than collective human will.
[1:26:12] On account of his contribution to our
[1:26:15] spiritual development in Botswana, I
[1:26:18] felt it was important to render
[1:26:20] therefore to all their Jews. Tribute to
[1:26:23] whom uh to tribute to whom tribute is
[1:26:26] due. Custom to whom custom is due. Fear
[1:26:31] to whom fear is due. Honor to whom honor
[1:26:34] is due. Romans 13:7. I hereby render my
[1:26:39] reflections of pastoral guima as a way
[1:26:42] of honoring him.
[1:26:45] Our memories are flooded with vivid
[1:26:48] unforgettable images and moments we
[1:26:51] encountered with with
[1:26:54] here on earth between 2005 and 2008.
[1:26:58] Pastor and his entourage frequently
[1:27:02] visit us in Botswana. It was an act of
[1:27:06] love and sacrifice of his part, his
[1:27:09] family and his assembly. May God reward
[1:27:13] you all with such current effort. During
[1:27:16] this missionary during his missionary
[1:27:18] trips the frequently
[1:27:21] he frequently ministered
[1:27:24] in H in Mulaboni
[1:27:28] and Matimab in Cabaroni.
[1:27:32] Sometimes it was normal local assembly
[1:27:34] services. At times it was special
[1:27:37] combined meetings and once in a while it
[1:27:40] was a convention. In April of 2006 he
[1:27:44] ordained me a pastor in Metab Tabernacle
[1:27:47] Greater Cabaron area. A year later he
[1:27:50] ordained pastor a pastors of Mabor and
[1:27:54] Kabani respectively. Indeed, Pastor
[1:27:57] Anadima got involved in Botswana at our
[1:28:00] critical stage of spiritual development,
[1:28:03] a defining moment in our history. With
[1:28:07] sound teaching, courage, and sheer
[1:28:10] determination, he propelled the
[1:28:12] affforementioned three places to a state
[1:28:16] of complete order. He believed we could
[1:28:19] amount to something noteworthy for God's
[1:28:23] glory.
[1:28:25] What an inspiring faith and confidence.
[1:28:28] His last visit to Botswana was in 2009
[1:28:32] and it was tremendous.
[1:28:42] We cannot forget the sermon he preached
[1:28:45] here in Botswana like the end of the
[1:28:48] seventh seal making me sanctuary beyond
[1:28:51] the kitten of time to mentioned by a
[1:28:54] few.
[1:28:55] It was always a blessing to see his
[1:28:58] remarkable teaching ministry move the
[1:29:00] audience from the comfort zone into the
[1:29:02] deeper zone of the revealed word of the
[1:29:05] day. He told the seven seal angels
[1:29:07] message distinct distinctly
[1:29:12] to make a sense to it much like Ezra the
[1:29:15] teacher and the scribe of Zerubbabel
[1:29:18] restoration Zerubbabel's restorations
[1:29:20] days it was always easy to note that
[1:29:25] this notable teacher was not just an aid
[1:29:29] um avid reader or dedicated student of
[1:29:32] Malachi 4 but he had revelation of the
[1:29:36] cont contents of Elijah's message. So
[1:29:39] profound was
[1:29:41] so profound was the impact of his
[1:29:44] teaching that he always led us a notch
[1:29:47] higher and yet craving for more. After
[1:29:50] attending his preaching services, one
[1:29:53] would feel like reading the message and
[1:29:56] the Bible more, praying more, seeking a
[1:29:59] closer walk with God, and believing God
[1:30:01] for things thought impossible. What an
[1:30:06] invaluable impact.
[1:30:08] We shall forever be grateful for his
[1:30:10] contribution to our spiritual growth
[1:30:12] during a critical stage [music] of
[1:30:15] spiritual journey. We shall surely miss
[1:30:18] this amazing member of the five-fold
[1:30:20] ministry whose teachings h with teaching
[1:30:25] whose teaching gift could make pictures
[1:30:28] uh with ways a teaching ministry which
[1:30:33] made the present day truth tangible and
[1:30:36] tactical through the unforgettable h
[1:30:39] pictorial and mental illustration.
[1:30:41] Furthermore, whether it was a convention
[1:30:45] in Botswana or a a convention in Mosul
[1:30:49] Bay or a convention in Mamoi, a wedding
[1:30:52] in Tbisa, Pastor Israel delivered Pastor
[1:30:57] Israel's delivery of the gospel was
[1:31:00] always captivating and stirring. He
[1:31:04] taught He taught the deep he taught the
[1:31:08] depth of message with simplicity. For he
[1:31:12] was a simple man, easy to approach and
[1:31:15] interact with. He bore the offense of
[1:31:19] the cross with simplicity with a smile
[1:31:22] and noticeable calmness. [music] May God
[1:31:25] comfort the Guima family and the Mor
[1:31:28] tabernacle during this passing face of
[1:31:30] grief.
[1:31:32] May God bless you and see you through
[1:31:35] and keep you. Brother Samuel
[1:31:38] Muli
[1:31:40] pastor pastor from Tabernacle.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That is our precious pastor.
[1:31:56] Amen. Amen. He has worked so much.
[1:31:59] I want to sing this song just to ask my
[1:32:03] pastor Mua just to come forth
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; and that it's a reason
[1:32:12] I sing and

[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Me. [singing]
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Once more, I'm standing in front of the
[1:33:05] children of God.
[1:33:09] Uh when my pastor was passing away,
[1:33:16] I nearly passed away also.
[1:33:20] Um when they were telling when they were
[1:33:23] telling me the pastor has passed away.
[1:33:28] I was sleeping in the ambulance.
[1:33:34] But now I'm here.
[1:33:41] I believe he's the one who said you must
[1:33:43] go back.
[1:33:50] We cannot go together.
[1:33:54] God bless you. [music]
[1:33:56] I'm going to share 10 minutes with my
[1:33:58] pastor here.
[1:34:00] You may take your seats.
[1:34:06] I want to read CO here
[1:34:11] and after I've read CO
[1:34:14] then I will read the report of the the
[1:34:17] decision of the board
[1:34:23] and that is the first the first is the
[1:34:27] placing of some deacons in the church.
[1:34:34] And our little church here is sovereign.
[1:34:40] Even this one is sovereign.
[1:34:44] It doesn't have any denomination or
[1:34:47] anything to send it deacons.
[1:34:54] It elects its own deacons.
[1:34:58] It elects its own pastor.
[1:35:01] It elects its trustees.
[1:35:06] It elects everything that comes in and
[1:35:09] out of the church.
[1:35:14] No one person has the say so over
[1:35:18] anything.
[1:35:21] It is the church.
[1:35:24] The church are those who come and
[1:35:27] support the church.
[1:35:31] with their presence,
[1:35:33] with their tithes,
[1:35:36] with their offering
[1:35:39] are always the ones that has the legal
[1:35:42] say so in the placing of
[1:35:53] this decision.
[1:35:59] The boat decided
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; that the boat must continue working as
[1:36:06] usual.
[1:36:10] No external
[1:36:14] interference.
[1:36:19] Pastor
[1:36:22] will help as usual.

[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You'll be you'll be given the the roster
[1:36:40] where pastor will be here preaching
[1:36:44] so that when you have children or

[1:37:30] which has happened to us.

[1:40:48] God bless you.
[1:40:52] First of all,
[1:40:54] I would like to thank you so much.
[1:40:58] The way you send away my friend,
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; it was like you sending away a minister
[1:41:06] of the government.
[1:41:15] despite all the challenges
[1:41:20] but all of you came
[1:41:23] to support.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; A vote of thanks to the family.
[1:41:42] Uh
[1:41:48] Brother.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; No, no. I want those at the hospital all
[1:41:58] the time. Yes.
[1:42:01] God bless you so
[1:42:04] God bless you so much.
[1:42:09] There were brothers who were there as
[1:42:10] well.
[1:42:12] to the family.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You took care of the pastor very well.
[1:42:20] God bless you.
[1:42:33] by God
[1:42:36] was
[1:42:37] all what you loved
[1:42:40] and all that loved you back
[1:42:43] shall be with you on the other side.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] Um I just want to say two warnings.
[1:43:02] Amen. First is to preachers.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Two preachers. The people who be
[1:43:08] standing here preaching,
[1:43:12] I'll be watching from Malawi.
[1:43:24] If I see you campaigning,
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; you are disqualified. Disqualifying,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; no self-promotion.
[1:44:01] By the way, I
[1:44:04] uh sorry, even at home, I don't have
[1:44:07] many friends.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I'm very straightforward.
[1:44:18] Even if there were 10 pastors agreeing,
[1:44:20] I would say no.
[1:44:28] because
[1:44:29] I've left the world for the message.
[1:44:33] I don't want to be in a political party
[1:44:35] in the
[1:44:44] request to the church.
[1:44:47] Oh yeah, let me start with the warning
[1:44:50] first.
[1:44:52] Beware
[1:44:54] of people who come in sheep's clothes.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Anybody who tell you to move out of this
[1:45:01] church
[1:45:04] is a wolf.
[1:45:13] Anybody who comes you and tells you
[1:45:15] better to move to a better place.
[1:45:18] There's no better place than this.
[1:45:26] Don't be carried away by people who come
[1:45:28] here and try to pull you this way or
[1:45:31] that way.
[1:45:34] Our pastor preached to us very well
[1:45:36] here.
[1:45:40] He He has left us in harmony.
[1:45:46] We'll wait for the rapture here.
[1:45:51] Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Or else you have to come to see the
[1:45:56] pastor in the rapture to apologize to
[1:45:58] him for
[1:46:02] moving away from his church.
[1:46:05] Be here.
[1:46:08] Peace
[1:46:09] always well
[1:46:18] church.
[1:46:19] One day
[1:46:22] the
[1:46:23] the disciples came to Jesus
[1:46:28] and asked him if my brother wronged me
[1:46:33] how many times should I forgive him.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; So they decided
[1:46:42] at least seven times a day.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. They said how many times?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Seven.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a to give somebody for in a
[1:46:54] day to forgive somebody seven times is
[1:46:56] very good.
[1:46:59] What did Jesus tell them?
[1:47:02] 70 times 70.
[1:47:09] If you are believers,
[1:47:12] you are going to be forgiving one
[1:47:13] another.
[1:47:16] 4,900
[1:47:18] times a day.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; 4,900 times church.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Let's have a heart of forgiving.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Peace will prevail here. Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; If you forgive one another,
[1:47:37] peace will prevail.
[1:47:40] If you pre to forgive one another.
[1:47:45] We are waiting for the rapture.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; We not we're not waiting for starting
[1:47:53] another church.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; One prayer which you should have very
[1:48:03] very much.
[1:48:08] Somebody's going to take over this
[1:48:09] place.
[1:48:12] If you put a politician here,
[1:48:19] you're in trouble.
[1:48:22] Every family here
[1:48:24] should hold prayers every night.
[1:48:33] And this is the prayer.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you the prayer. God give us a
[1:48:41] a pastor like pastor.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; We want a pastor will be here.
[1:48:58] Uh
[1:49:01] the pastor who should stand here
[1:49:04] should be in in another board.
[1:49:12] Hallelujah.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:49:16] Uh maybe the board will uh
[1:49:20] uh
[1:49:22] will forgive us
[1:49:25] uh for putting the oneear timeline
[1:49:30] because uh me and my friend felt it
[1:49:33] right that there should be more than a
[1:49:36] year. When we are still observing
[1:49:38] people, we are still observing.
[1:49:45] God bless you. Today you have another
[1:49:48] son of preaching.
[1:49:55] Amen.
[1:49:56] Hallelujah.
[1:50:00] God bless you. We can we can all stand.
[1:50:04] Amen. Hallelujah. But in the days
[1:50:09] of the voice

[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Um, I'm so glad to be here
[1:52:44] this morning to see
[1:52:46] to see your faces.
[1:52:55] Your faces are glowing.
[1:53:01] I can see that everything is fine.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; God is in control of everything.
[1:53:13] situation.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, a church like this one
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; is so settled with the weight
[1:53:26] by having a pastor like Pastor Israel.
[1:53:32] God is here.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:39] And I'm so confident
[1:53:44] that everything is going to be well.
[1:53:49] Yeah, I'm so confident.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. And I'm so glad also to see my
[1:53:54] friends boo.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. much.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; So
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; this morning I have a a subject I want
[1:54:04] to talk with you
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; about the gathering of God's attributes
[1:54:12] in the sixth dimension
[1:54:21] the gathering of God's attributes
[1:54:26] in the six dimension.
[1:54:30] And we can read the word directly in
[1:54:33] first Thessalonians
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; chapter 4.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; beginning by verse 13.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 13.
[1:54:48] The Bible say
[1:54:52] I read in Jesus Christ name.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; But we do not want you to be ignorant
[1:55:00] brothers
[1:55:01] about those who are asleep that you may
[1:55:05] not grieve as others do who have no
[1:55:09] hope.
[1:55:11] For since we believe that Jesus died and
[1:55:15] rose again, even so through Jesus, God
[1:55:19] will bring with him those who have
[1:55:23] fallen asleep. For this we declare to
[1:55:26] you by a word from the Lord that we who
[1:55:31] are alive who are left until the coming
[1:55:35] of the Lord will not preede those who
[1:55:39] have fallen asleep.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Lord himself will descend
[1:55:43] from heaven with a cry of a comment with
[1:55:47] the voice of an archangel and with the
[1:55:50] sound of the trumpet of God and the dead
[1:55:54] in Christ will rise first.
[1:55:57] Then we who are alive,
[1:56:02] who are left, will be caught up together
[1:56:07] with them in the cloud to meet the Lord
[1:56:10] in the air. And so we will always be
[1:56:14] with the Lord.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Therefore, encourage one another with
[1:56:20] these words.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; May God b his blessing on the reading of
[1:56:24] these words.
[1:56:34] So you know with a message like ours,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; the voice of the seven angel,
[1:56:45] what is nothing else but the seven
[1:56:47] seals.
[1:56:52] Everything that was kept secret
[1:56:58] during the ages
[1:57:01] must be revealed by the message
[1:57:06] and everything was revealed.
[1:57:12] But today I want just to take your
[1:57:15] attention on something.
[1:57:19] I I think it's very important for you as
[1:57:21] a believers
[1:57:25] that you must know
[1:57:28] as Paul say in the Bible. You must not
[1:57:31] be uninformed
[1:57:36] about two things.
[1:57:39] two things.
[1:57:41] Listen to me now. The prophecy in the
[1:57:43] message, who is this?
[1:57:50] Paragraph point 112 paragraph 112 the
[1:57:53] prophet says
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; now we see here
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; in the sermon who is meched
[1:58:05] the objective of God
[1:58:07] when the prophet was preaching that
[1:58:09] sermon
[1:58:12] is to let you see
[1:58:15] plainly
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; The complete secret of our lives in
[1:58:22] JOURNEY
[1:58:26] and death.
[1:58:29] When we go after we die
[1:58:34] also predestination
[1:58:38] in plain view
[1:58:42] here.
[1:58:43] Now listen as we teach this close.
[1:58:51] Are you listening?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; There are two things you must know
[1:58:59] and those things must be explained to
[1:59:02] you in plain view.
[1:59:07] First thing, where are you going
[1:59:12] after death?
[1:59:14] Where exactly are you going?
[1:59:18] That's the first point. The second
[1:59:20] point,
[1:59:22] where do you come FROM
[1:59:26] by predestination?
[1:59:29] There are two things you must know.
[1:59:33] Where are you going? When your journey
[1:59:37] here on earth is done,
[1:59:40] God wants you to know exactly where you
[1:59:43] are going.
[1:59:46] Then at the same time, God wants you to
[1:59:50] know exactly in plain VIEW
[1:59:55] where do you come from?
[2:00:00] And when you know where you are going
[2:00:03] and where you are coming from,
[2:00:06] then you know exactly where you are.
[2:00:13] Your position
[2:00:15] is revealed to you.
[2:00:18] When you understand where you are going
[2:00:22] and where DO YOU COME FROM?
[2:00:24] BECAUSE YOU ARE IN between
[2:00:28] between death
[2:00:30] and eternity.
[2:00:32] Knowing your position
[2:00:35] makes you
[2:00:37] in position to go to the rapture
[2:00:41] because the prophet connected the
[2:00:44] rapture
[2:00:47] with the knowledge of your position.
[2:00:52] Let let me hear in amen. Amen. The
[2:00:55] prophet says the day you will know your
[2:00:59] position
[2:01:02] is the day you go to the rapture.
[2:01:06] And as we are sitting here today,
[2:01:09] we are only waiting for the rapture.
[2:01:13] So if you are waiting for the rapture,
[2:01:16] you must know your position.
[2:01:19] And to know your position
[2:01:21] means two things.
[2:01:23] You must know where YOU YOU COME FROM
[2:01:27] AND WHERE ARE you going?
[2:01:30] Give me an amen and I could Amen.
[2:01:35] And the prophet go on.
[2:01:39] Now if you know where you come from
[2:01:44] then the the mystery of your
[2:01:46] predestination
[2:01:50] will be revealed to you.
[2:01:53] Predestination
[2:01:55] means there is a force
[2:01:59] behind you
[2:02:01] that will call you
[2:02:04] and be able to keep you
[2:02:07] until you reach destination.
[2:02:12] It does not depends on you.
[2:02:16] THERE IS A FORCE
[2:02:18] behind you THAT CALLED YOU IN THIS
[2:02:21] MESSAGE
[2:02:23] and that power HAS A CAPACITY TO KEEP
[2:02:27] YOU until you reach destination.
[2:02:31] And today I come to SAY TO YOU,
[2:02:35] you will reach DESTINATION
[2:02:38] because the power of predestination
[2:02:42] is so powerful
[2:02:45] that he can even work against your own
[2:02:48] will.
[2:02:53] If God before the foundation OF THE
[2:02:56] WORLD,
[2:02:58] SO YOU HEAR
[2:03:00] THERE IS NO MAN
[2:03:03] THAT CAN MOVE YOU FROM HERE
[2:03:09] BECAUSE THAT POWER
[2:03:11] OF predestination
[2:03:13] has received a command
[2:03:16] from GOD
[2:03:18] KEEP YOU AT THE RIGHT PLACE.
[2:03:24] AMEN.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Because children of God
[2:03:28] are attributes from God
[2:03:33] and the attributes of God
[2:03:36] were in the thinking of God
[2:03:41] and elected
[2:03:43] is a chosen one.
[2:03:46] AND IF HE'S A CHOSEN,
[2:03:48] it's because he was with God
[2:03:52] before the foundation.
[2:03:57] Actually, where you are going
[2:04:01] is the very place you came from.
[2:04:06] So there is no possibility for you to
[2:04:09] get lost.
[2:04:13] You just going
[2:04:16] to recather
[2:04:19] where you COME FROM.
[2:04:22] God actually in the rapture is the
[2:04:27] calling of his own attributes. Amen.
[2:04:33] It's God
[2:04:35] calling God.
[2:04:38] Amen.
[2:04:42] Hallelujah.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet says.
[2:04:46] in the message,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; the identified Christ of all ages.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Identify Christ of all ages.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet said this,
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; I could not find the point, but you you
[2:05:00] will find it as as I as I'm reading.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet said this.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Now, God is a great like a great being.
[2:05:15] Elohim
[2:05:17] is a great being
[2:05:20] in the beginning.
[2:05:22] God,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; see he was not even God. You know that
[2:05:29] to to begin with in the beginning God
[2:05:32] was not God.
[2:05:34] Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet said God
[2:05:37] is an object of worship
[2:05:42] and there was nothing to worship.
[2:05:46] He was self-existent
[2:05:49] and there was nothing to WORSHIP HIM.
[2:05:53] WHEN he created angels
[2:05:57] then there was something to worship him.
[2:06:02] Hey, and you heavy.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; You know, we are the only GROUP OF
[2:06:06] PEOPLE
[2:06:08] who know God before he became God.
[2:06:15] You know, the the the messenger,
[2:06:19] the prophet received from God's
[2:06:23] the mission to reveal God to his people.
[2:06:30] You know those those churches,
[2:06:32] Pentecostals and others,
[2:06:36] they don't know that God was not God in
[2:06:41] the beginning.
[2:06:43] But you and I we know that God
[2:06:48] was not God.
[2:06:51] Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; But he became God
[2:06:55] when he created angels.
[2:06:57] And the Bible says God the Father who is
[2:07:02] invisible
[2:07:04] told the angels
[2:07:06] TO WORSHIP
[2:07:08] the angel of the Lord.
[2:07:10] THEN GOD became God.
[2:07:14] Hey, let me say amen. So I go on.
[2:07:18] He He was a selfexistent.
[2:07:22] He was big.
[2:07:24] The prophet says he was a thinking.
[2:07:29] He was just a mind.
[2:07:32] God the father
[2:07:34] was cannot be seen.
[2:07:38] No one has seen God at any time.
[2:07:43] And when he WAS IN THIS F
[2:07:46] the invisible one inside of him there
[2:07:51] were attributes.
[2:07:53] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that in this great
[2:07:59] god
[2:08:01] Elohim
[2:08:03] was attribute.
[2:08:06] There was attribute in there
[2:08:09] to be gods. Attribute to be fathers.
[2:08:14] to be attribute to be savior ATTRIBUTE
[2:08:18] TO BE HEALER.
[2:08:19] THIS ATTRIBUTE WAS IN GOD
[2:08:23] BUT THEY WERE INVISIBLE
[2:08:25] BECAUSE ATTRIBUTES
[2:08:27] ARE thinking
[2:08:30] and you cannot SEE THINKING
[2:08:32] BUT WHEN THE THINKING of God was
[2:08:36] expressed then it become the word
[2:08:39] and when the word get in flesh THEN YOU
[2:08:43] CAN SEE THE attribute of God
[2:08:46] the flesh the
[2:08:49] in the flesh is the manifestation of the
[2:08:53] attribute of God.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:57] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; And when they say that you are the
[2:09:01] attribute of God,
[2:09:04] it means when the word of God gets in
[2:09:07] you,
[2:09:10] you become good.
[2:09:13] Amen.
[2:09:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:09:17] Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; And the only way
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; by what the world can see God
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; is you. Amen.
[2:09:30] Give me an amen. Amen. Amen. It's you.
[2:09:35] The prophet say, "And if you have got
[2:09:39] eternal life,
[2:09:43] someone here has eternal life here.
[2:09:46] Let me see your hand.
[2:09:50] The prophet says if you ever got eternal
[2:09:53] life,
[2:09:55] you are in God's attitude
[2:09:58] because you are eternal life.
[2:10:01] Amen. Amen. Because eternal life
[2:10:05] is the only life of God himself.
[2:10:09] And if you say you have eternal life,
[2:10:13] that's only means that you are God.
[2:10:17] Because the eternal life is a form of
[2:10:21] God HIMSELF
[2:10:25] and that is called the Zoe.
[2:10:29] Hallelujah. Zoe.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; It's the only life of God himself.
[2:10:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus came as a
[2:10:40] redeemer
[2:10:42] and redeem
[2:10:44] means
[2:10:46] you get back to where he started.
[2:10:50] That's what redemption means.
[2:10:53] You were somewhere
[2:10:55] and redeemer redemption
[2:10:58] means you are now going where you came
[2:11:01] from.
[2:11:03] Amen. Amen. AND YOU WERE WITH GOD
[2:11:06] TO start with AND THEN YOU CAME HERE TO
[2:11:10] BE A MANIFESTATION and the rapture IS
[2:11:13] BRINGING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME
[2:11:16] FROM.
[2:11:19] So you are obliged
[2:11:23] to reach your destination.
[2:11:28] Even if you go down the valley,
[2:11:33] you have ups and downs.
[2:11:38] Good days and bad days,
[2:11:41] high level AND DOWN.
[2:11:45] ONE THING IS A SURE
[2:11:48] WE REACH THE
[2:11:51] WHY? Because you were there.
[2:11:56] Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says you were in God's
[2:12:00] thinking.
[2:12:02] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Like a man, let's let's go down there.
[2:12:06] Like a man making chime. So the church
[2:12:08] put in so so much breast and so MUCH
[2:12:16] knows
[2:12:18] just
[2:12:19] exactly
[2:12:21] where you belong.
[2:12:25] [laughter] Amen.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; God knows what
[2:12:30] exactly
[2:12:33] where you belong.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG to
[2:12:39] Amen.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; YOUR PROMISE IS THE SEVEN SINS.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Your promise is THE SEVEN SINS
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE GOING TO THE REALITY.
[2:12:54] HE KNOWS EXACTLY where you belong.
[2:13:01] He knows even what age you belong in.
[2:13:07] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Because the prophecies
[2:13:11] in eternity
[2:13:14] when you were just thinking of God,
[2:13:18] you were not like this.
[2:13:20] You were just attributes of God.
[2:13:24] There in eternity,
[2:13:26] God had a CONFERENCE
[2:13:30] with all his attributes.
[2:13:34] You talked about this journey together
[2:13:36] with God himself
[2:13:41] and in that conference
[2:13:43] you chose pastor as your pastor
[2:13:50] and God SAY AMEN
[2:13:53] AND YOU CHOSE
[2:13:55] AS YOUR CHURCH
[2:13:57] and in eternity GOD SAY AMEN.
[2:14:01] AND today God knows exactly where you
[2:14:04] are.
[2:14:10] And God knows under what ministry he
[2:14:14] puts you.
[2:14:20] You know when you come to church
[2:14:23] it looks like it was your own choosing.
[2:14:28] But let me tell you, it was not you,
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; it's him. [laughter]
[2:14:37] And the prophet goes and says
[2:14:40] even when you are in the message,
[2:14:43] it looks like it was your own efforts
[2:14:47] and trying also to keep on in the
[2:14:50] message. Let me tell you, no one can
[2:14:53] keep himself IN THE MESSAGE.
[2:14:56] THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS GIVING YOU
[2:15:00] HIMSELF
[2:15:02] AND HE knows exactly how to do his job.
[2:15:07] You are going to go nowhere.
[2:15:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in that conference
[2:15:18] we decided everything
[2:15:21] and we saw even our fallen our our
[2:15:24] downs.
[2:15:27] And the prophet says, "God saw you
[2:15:31] from the beginning to the end.
[2:15:34] He knew YOUR WEAKNESSES.
[2:15:38] HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
[2:15:41] HE KNEW HOW bad you are.
[2:15:45] It chose you.
[2:15:48] [cheering and applause]
[2:15:50] You know what? Even when I'm preaching
[2:15:52] here, I'm not a good THE BEST ONE.
[2:15:56] NO, but God chose me to be to do this.
[2:16:02] It It WAS NOT MY CHOOSING. IT was him.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I'M HERE, HE MUST BE HERE WITH
[2:16:09] ME.
[2:16:12] AMEN.
[2:16:13] HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:17] Let's go on.
[2:16:19] I have so many things to say today.
[2:16:23] Give me three hours.
[2:16:30] The prophet says, "And therefore
[2:16:35] if you got eternal life,
[2:16:38] the word eternal
[2:16:40] is something never did begin
[2:16:46] or never can end.
[2:16:49] If you have eternal life,
[2:16:52] it means you never begin
[2:16:55] and you never cease.
[2:16:59] So whoever you were
[2:17:04] see you were, you always were.
[2:17:11] You see you you not started just here.
[2:17:19] You were eternal.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Even before you get to the message
[2:17:27] because eternal means
[2:17:29] it cannot start, it cannot begin AND IT
[2:17:33] CANNOT END. So it means you always were
[2:17:38] eternal.
[2:17:41] But when you believe
[2:17:44] the message is the manifestation
[2:17:49] of your eternity.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; SAY AMEN TO the world is the
[2:17:57] manifestation
[2:17:59] of your eternity.
[2:18:03] In the beginning of the word,
[2:18:07] you were God's attributes
[2:18:11] being displayed.
[2:18:14] Because if you were a thinking of God
[2:18:17] when God spoke
[2:18:20] his thinking out,
[2:18:23] then you became a word.
[2:18:29] That's why today you are called a a a
[2:18:32] word bride
[2:18:36] because you are the word of God.
[2:18:41] You you are not just a listener of the
[2:18:43] word.
[2:18:46] You are the word.
[2:18:49] That's the reason you you understand the
[2:18:51] words
[2:18:53] because you are the word.
[2:18:56] You are the message of the hour.
[2:19:00] That's the reason you believe the
[2:19:02] message.
[2:19:04] You cannot believe what you are not.
[2:19:10] Actually, you say amen to what you are.
[2:19:12] Amen.
[2:19:17] Each child of God was first and
[2:19:20] attributed.
[2:19:25] That means a thinking
[2:19:28] then that attribute displeased
[2:19:33] by becoming a word and then after
[2:19:36] becoming the word that word gets in a
[2:19:40] flesh.
[2:19:43] Hallelujah. Amen. The word in the FLESH
[2:19:47] IS THE revelation of God.
[2:19:54] as a thinking
[2:19:57] you cannot see God
[2:19:59] when it becomes a word that's a pillar
[2:20:02] of fire it can appear and disappear
[2:20:06] when the word get IN THE FLESH
[2:20:10] THEN YOU see gods
[2:20:12] amen
[2:20:16] you see a man
[2:20:18] who VEILS THE WORLD
[2:20:22] IN YOUR GENERATION
[2:20:25] YOU SEE GOD.
[2:20:26] AMEN.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; And the word
[2:20:32] is a thought
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; made manifest.
[2:20:38] You know that.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; And the word is a thought manifest.
[2:20:45] You think it
[2:20:47] then speak it. Like you say the light.
[2:20:50] Before
[2:20:52] saying the light, you had to think the
[2:20:54] light.
[2:20:56] When you think about the light, then you
[2:20:58] speak the light. And then the light is
[2:21:01] there. And you must think first that you
[2:21:06] are a son of God. Then speak it. I am a
[2:21:10] son of God. Then you become a son of
[2:21:15] God.
[2:21:16] Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Anything that you want to be manifested
[2:21:23] must first get in your thinking.
[2:21:29] That's the way God created heaven and
[2:21:32] earth.
[2:21:34] God first think about the world
[2:21:37] then he speak it and then it was there.
[2:21:44] Never have a negative confession of
[2:21:47] yourself.
[2:21:53] Never have a negative confession of what
[2:21:56] your church is.
[2:22:02] Melody is the best church over the
[2:22:04] world.
[2:22:10] Amen. Yeah. Hallelujah. like like like
[2:22:13] Jesus when he was walking on earth
[2:22:17] and he asked to Peter
[2:22:20] and he said if you don't eat my flesh
[2:22:23] don't drink my blood you don't have
[2:22:25] eternal life and then Peter looked to
[2:22:28] him he said we know that you have the
[2:22:33] word of life where are we going
[2:22:37] we go nowhere because we held the word
[2:22:42] of life here in this church. You have
[2:22:45] heard the word of your translation
[2:22:49] FOR YOUR RAPTURE. EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IT
[2:22:52] FROM HERE.
[2:22:54] WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THERE'S NO PLACE WE
[2:22:57] ARE.
[2:22:58] AMEN.
[2:23:04] AMEN.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; There's no church here
[2:23:07] who can preach a word like here.
[2:23:11] I always said I always tell my my
[2:23:13] church.
[2:23:15] I only got two churches where I can
[2:23:17] preach freely.
[2:23:20] Hosana tabernacle
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; and
[2:23:25] [applause]
[2:23:28] here I can preach.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Because you have the level
[2:23:36] together these two things.
[2:23:40] You [applause] you have the caliber.
[2:23:44] You get the caliber to receive those
[2:23:47] things.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hey, I want you to just clap your hand
[2:23:51] for yourself.
[2:23:58] Never,
[2:23:59] never, ever
[2:24:02] have a negative confession
[2:24:06] about yourself, about your brother,
[2:24:10] about your sister, about your church.
[2:24:13] NEVER, EVER, always be positive.
[2:24:21] [applause]
[2:24:22] I can see this church growing.
[2:24:25] I can see this CHURCH BLESSED.
[2:24:29] I see blessing of God coming up on this.
[2:24:33] I can see the people here prospering
[2:24:36] IN REVELATION IN POWER IN EVERYTHING
[2:24:41] because I am a thinking of God.
[2:24:46] And when I confess it
[2:24:49] then it will be
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet end by saying we are
[2:25:03] God's attributes displayed.
[2:25:14] Yes. Amen. Displayed.
[2:25:16] Attributes of God
[2:25:19] displayed.
[2:25:20] So we were with him
[2:25:24] in the beginning and then we were
[2:25:26] displayed.
[2:25:29] We left heaven.
[2:25:31] We went here to be manifested
[2:25:36] to be tempted
[2:25:39] and to win the battle.
[2:25:42] And we are winners to this morning.
[2:25:47] Hallelujah. Amen. And then
[2:25:50] God promised us another gathering.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; We must be gathered again.
[2:26:12] Your earthly journey is over
[2:26:18] because there is a time allotted for
[2:26:21] every one of you.
[2:26:26] There is no permanent dwelling here on
[2:26:30] earth.
[2:26:34] But if this dwelling PLACE IS DESTROYED,
[2:26:40] WE KNOW THAT THERE is another way to
[2:26:42] live for us
[2:26:45] because we cannot die.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; You You cannot have eternal life
[2:26:55] and then die. [clears throat]
[2:27:01] You cannot.
[2:27:03] The prophecies
[2:27:05] in the future home
[2:27:08] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[2:27:09] earthly bride.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; 482.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; "Death
[2:27:20] does not change you,
[2:27:24] but death only change your dwelling
[2:27:29] place."
[2:27:32] So it's just about changing dwelling
[2:27:34] places
[2:27:37] and changing dwelling places means
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; changing dimensions
[2:27:44] dimension.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; We change only dimensions.
[2:27:50] We came from one dimension.
[2:27:54] We get into this dimension.
[2:27:57] And when our time is over,
[2:27:59] we have to change the dwelling place.
[2:28:03] CHANGING DIMENSION dimension
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; but we are still we
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; nothing will change
[2:28:13] but only the dwelling place.
[2:28:18] So now let's deal with one point.
[2:28:22] Who are those who are supposed to be
[2:28:25] gathered in that sixth dimension?
[2:28:33] We'll have time today to speak about
[2:28:35] dimension. I know you know those things
[2:28:39] but I want just to repeat it with you.
[2:28:43] Who are those who are going to be
[2:28:45] gathered in that sixth dimension?
[2:28:51] The prophet says in the message I have
[2:28:54] heard but now I see.
[2:29:00] I've heard but now I see.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Point 10 104 104.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; only the elected can be gathered.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Elected
[2:29:16] you see. Amen.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Elected
[2:29:19] means there were many but God chose you.
[2:29:28] Hallelujah.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; God chose you.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; There were many
[2:29:34] but elected.
[2:29:37] The prophet says the elected of God seen
[2:29:41] it in Noah's time.
[2:29:45] How can you know that you are elected
[2:29:48] when you can see the message of your
[2:29:51] time?
[2:29:54] And what is the message of your time?
[2:29:59] It's not the first poll.
[2:30:01] It's not the second P.
[2:30:04] Those words only the means of God used
[2:30:06] to attract you.
[2:30:11] When they pray for you and you are
[2:30:13] healed,
[2:30:14] that's not a message.
[2:30:17] That's just something to attract you.
[2:30:21] when they prophesize on you and it's
[2:30:24] it's glorious, but that's not the
[2:30:27] message. It's just a way for God to
[2:30:29] attract you
[2:30:32] AFTER THE SIGNS, AFTER MIRACLES,
[2:30:36] WHEN YOU SIT DOWN IN A teaching service,
[2:30:42] then the message came
[2:30:45] and the message of the hour
[2:30:48] is the seven seals.
[2:30:51] Amen.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Is the seven thunders.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; The opening of the seven sea.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; The silence.
[2:31:05] That's the message.
[2:31:07] Amen. The message is in the silence.
[2:31:12] Because those are being selected are so
[2:31:16] precious.
[2:31:19] God won't let in someone who is not in
[2:31:22] this plane.
[2:31:27] And God puts the message in a silence
[2:31:32] like in the time of Daniel
[2:31:35] when the king Nebuchadnezzar
[2:31:38] had that dream
[2:31:40] and he called all the magicians
[2:31:44] and told them I had the dream in the
[2:31:47] night
[2:31:49] and I I want you
[2:31:52] first give me the dream.
[2:31:55] Second is interpretation.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; The magicians.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; There are also many preachers that are
[2:32:03] magicians
[2:32:06] and God knew them before the foundation
[2:32:08] of the world.
[2:32:10] They cannot manipulate our message.
[2:32:14] They put it in a silence.
[2:32:18] PREACH THE SEVEN.
[2:32:20] THERE IS A SILENCE.
[2:32:23] AMEN. How can a preacher speak?
[2:32:28] Well, GOD DID NOT SPEAK.
[2:32:31] THAT'S YOUR MESSAGE. NOW,
[2:32:36] only God can speak when God sings.
[2:32:46] Someone has got my point.
[2:32:49] If someone can preach where God has
[2:32:52] sealed,
[2:32:58] it means it's not a man, but it's God
[2:33:00] himself.
[2:33:06] THE THIRD POOL IS NOT A MAN.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; THE THIRD pool is God himself.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ah amen. The prophet says
[2:33:21] it only the elected
[2:33:25] put it only the elected could seen it in
[2:33:27] Noah's time
[2:33:31] in Moses time in Jesus time in the
[2:33:35] apostle time in Luther time in Wesley
[2:33:40] Pentecostal times because that was the
[2:33:43] seed that was on earth when the
[2:33:46] inspiration was poured out.
[2:33:53] So you were there
[2:33:56] when God spoke it in eternity.
[2:33:59] And when God seal it, you can still hear
[2:34:03] because God spoke to you about those
[2:34:06] things before you come here.
[2:34:11] When the inspiration is called out,
[2:34:15] you listen something coming FROM YOUR
[2:34:17] THEOPHONY.
[2:34:20] LET LET LET ME SAY amen to that myself.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet says a son of God when a
[2:34:30] preacher IS PREACHING
[2:34:32] YOU ARE NOT listening from the preacher.
[2:34:37] God has put just across you behind at
[2:34:41] your side
[2:34:43] your theophony. YOUR THEOPHONY IS JUST
[2:34:46] THERE. AND WHEN I'm preaching your
[2:34:49] theophony
[2:34:51] explain those things to you
[2:34:56] from heart to heart
[2:35:02] even when I'm preaching I preach from my
[2:35:05] heart. I'm not using my head.
[2:35:09] No, I'm not using this because the
[2:35:12] things I'm saying I have not WRITTEN
[2:35:15] THEM SOMEWHERE.
[2:35:18] JUST COMES from God in my heart and it
[2:35:21] goes to you in your theophony and your
[2:35:24] theophony put it in your heart
[2:35:28] and you say amen.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; It's it's so sacred.
[2:35:37] The prophet said the third pool
[2:35:40] is so sacred.
[2:35:43] No one must say something about that.
[2:35:48] spirit
[2:35:53] [applause] because
[2:35:55] okay okay let let's put it now now while
[2:35:58] the inspiration is pulled out
[2:36:03] to gather the bride
[2:36:07] together
[2:36:09] it's only those who are elected will see
[2:36:16] If you see
[2:36:18] the message of the hour the seven seas
[2:36:23] that means you are elected. Amen.
[2:36:29] And if you are elected,
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; then you are a candidate
[2:36:35] candidate when your journey or here on
[2:36:38] earth will be done.
[2:36:41] When you cross the Jordan,
[2:36:44] you will be reathered
[2:36:47] in a higher divine dimension
[2:36:51] called the sixth dimension.
[2:36:55] Dimension.
[2:36:57] It's only the elected.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, I thank thee
[2:37:07] that thou has hid these things
[2:37:11] from the eyes of the wise
[2:37:15] AND PRUDENCE AND REVEALED it
[2:37:20] such as we learn.
[2:37:25] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; let's go on now.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; About the gathering
[2:37:36] of God's attribute.
[2:37:39] You understand the point.
[2:37:42] You must have been an attribute there
[2:37:44] before
[2:37:47] then displayed here,
[2:37:50] manifested in the flesh
[2:37:53] to receive the message.
[2:37:56] to gather you back where you came from.
[2:38:01] That's the plan.
[2:38:04] If you were not there,
[2:38:07] you cannot get to the sixth dimension
[2:38:11] because there is a selection.
[2:38:15] Only the selected ones can get there.
[2:38:21] Not the members of church,
[2:38:24] but the bride.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; You are no more the church here.
[2:38:30] You are the bride.
[2:38:34] I want the amen coming from the balcony.
[2:38:39] Are you with me?
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Now there is a sixth dimension
[2:38:49] and the prophet says when God created
[2:38:51] heaven and earth,
[2:38:54] God created many earth.
[2:39:00] Dimensions are worlds.
[2:39:05] Dimensions are worlds. Dimension.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:12] as real as this one.
[2:39:17] Amen. Amen.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Dimensions
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; a world
[2:39:22] as real as this.
[2:39:27] It's not a fiction.
[2:39:30] It's not a dream,
[2:39:32] but it's as real as
[2:39:37] touchable. YOU CAN TOUCH IT AND YOU CAN
[2:39:40] TOUCH THE PEOPLE who live in those
[2:39:43] dimensions.
[2:39:46] And there are seven
[2:39:50] the prophet says
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; in the message present stage of my
[2:39:53] ministry
[2:39:57] paragraph 199
[2:40:00] the prophet says this.
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; Let me go quickly with this.
[2:40:07] I know this pulpit is pastor pulpit
[2:40:11] and he taught you all of those things.
[2:40:15] I'm just here to support it.
[2:40:20] Yeah.
[2:40:25] You remember in the vision
[2:40:28] the the little translation
[2:40:31] translation as I will call it
[2:40:35] the prophet when when he went there
[2:40:39] in that world
[2:40:41] called the sixth dimension.
[2:40:45] The prophet says it was a translation
[2:40:52] translation.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; You know the translations is the mean by
[2:40:56] what you can get into that sixth
[2:40:58] dimension
[2:41:02] and the dimension the translation is
[2:41:05] also a way for you to get into the
[2:41:06] rapture.
[2:41:11] So the secret of the rapture is hid
[2:41:13] here. Amen.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? Now,
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; now
[2:41:22] the prophet says,
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; you remember the little translation as I
[2:41:26] called it was
[2:41:30] when I was taken.
[2:41:33] Are you with me? The prophet was
[2:41:37] taken and he was he was he was laying on
[2:41:41] his bed.
[2:41:44] And he came out from his body
[2:41:48] and he left his body laying on the bed
[2:41:53] and was taken in another dimension.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; And he called it translation.
[2:42:03] The prophet says, he says, I saw
[2:42:07] those people and looked back to myself
[2:42:13] and all those millions there.
[2:42:17] You see, he could see himself laying
[2:42:20] down
[2:42:22] at the same time seeing those millions
[2:42:25] coming to him
[2:42:28] and he could not explain it.
[2:42:31] He called and was taken into another
[2:42:34] dimension.
[2:42:37] And the dimension was real.
[2:42:41] And people were there
[2:42:43] AS YOUNG AS EVER
[2:42:46] AND strong
[2:42:48] and beautiful girls and women,
[2:42:51] beautiful men.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I want to see
[2:42:59] Jesus.
[2:43:03] Hallelujah.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; When your time here is over,
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; when you cross Jordan,
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; your first
[2:43:14] your first desire
[2:43:17] must be
[2:43:19] to see Jesus.
[2:43:22] [applause]
[2:43:24] But he could not see him.
[2:43:29] They told him
[2:43:30] is higher.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; There is another dimension
[2:43:37] higher than the sixth one.
[2:43:40] THAT HIGHER dimension
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; is the seventh dimension.
[2:43:46] Jesus is not in the sixth.
[2:43:49] Jesus is in the seventh.
[2:43:53] But you are not gather in the seventh.
[2:43:57] You are gather in the sixth.
[2:44:00] Amen.
[2:44:02] [applause]
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; When you cross Jordan,
[2:44:10] when your life is over,
[2:44:14] you will see your brothers and sisters.
[2:44:18] You shall see. Amen.
[2:44:23] Not Jesus because Jesus is higher.
[2:44:30] The gathering,
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; the gathering of God's attributes
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; is in the sixth dimension dimension.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in the seventh
[2:44:47] dimension,
[2:44:49] God
[2:44:51] lives there alone.
[2:44:57] The prophet continues,
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; listen, he said, well,
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; see, when people die,
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; when people die,
[2:45:08] they
[2:45:10] don't immediately go up with God.
[2:45:18] Now remember,
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; God is revealing to you
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; the secrets of death.
[2:45:28] Where you go when your time here is
[2:45:32] over.
[2:45:34] You must know
[2:45:37] what is going on there.
[2:45:41] You won't be immediately with God,
[2:45:46] but you will be gathered with your
[2:45:49] brothers and sisters. Amen.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; They were coming from everywhere
[2:45:57] and saying to our prophets,
[2:46:00] our precious brother,
[2:46:03] we are happy to see you here.
[2:46:06] When your TIME IS OVER,
[2:46:09] YOU ARE passing over there and you MEET
[2:46:12] PASTOR
[2:46:14] AND YOU SAY, "PASTOR, [screaming]
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD to see you here,
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; our precious brother."
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:29] The prophet says
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; now
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; you
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you will understand that.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding what the prophet
[2:46:40] said?
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; Don't be ignorant
[2:46:47] like those who have no hope.
[2:46:51] God wants you to know
[2:46:55] before you leave here
[2:46:57] who are there waiting for you and what
[2:47:00] is going on there
[2:47:04] because you are a selected people.
[2:47:08] You cannot just go in a rapture
[2:47:12] in ignorance of what is going on there.
[2:47:18] God wants you to know exactly
[2:47:24] what will be there when we reach that
[2:47:27] place.
[2:47:29] He said maybe I to explain it the best
[2:47:32] that I can.
[2:47:37] So even the prophet he he understood
[2:47:40] that it's not easy
[2:47:44] for people to get that point.
[2:47:48] Let me be clear now. You will get Jesus,
[2:47:51] right? But when you get there, there
[2:47:54] will be no Jesus there but your brothers
[2:47:57] and sisters
[2:48:01] because Jesus is higher.
[2:48:06] Amen. Amen.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; That's why you will be gathered with the
[2:48:11] people that you know.
[2:48:15] I I didn't bring that that quote today,
[2:48:17] but the prophet says
[2:48:20] even when you are ready to go to the
[2:48:21] rapture,
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; the people that was gone before
[2:48:30] that we come back here that you shall
[2:48:33] meet
[2:48:34] must be the person that you know.
[2:48:40] Not Peter,
[2:48:42] not Paul, not Boswell.
[2:48:45] but your South African brothers and
[2:48:47] sisters
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; and especially your leader
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; because your leader
[2:49:00] stands for God for you.
[2:49:06] Hey, I I didn't hear. Amen. Remember
[2:49:12] an attribute of God
[2:49:15] when it becomes the word
[2:49:18] and that word get into the flesh.
[2:49:21] You see God.
[2:49:24] Amen. You see God.
[2:49:30] Amen. Hey,
[2:49:34] I like this church
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; because you get the point so quickly.
[2:49:40] Yeah, I can feel it that you are
[2:49:43] understanding what I'm saying
[2:49:46] because I I I feel the the reaction, the
[2:49:48] feedback
[2:49:50] feedback.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; You know, every preacher
[2:49:54] when people are getting what you are
[2:49:56] preaching, you can feel it.
[2:50:00] When they are not getting, it returns
[2:50:02] back to you.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; Then you close your book and say,
[2:50:06] "Amen." That's all.
[2:50:10] But when you are still receiving like
[2:50:12] this
[2:50:15] you are giving me more hours.
[2:50:19] [laughter]
[2:50:28] Amen.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; I like this.
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet said
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; 20. Well, see,
[2:50:37] okay. Oh, no. No, no. Uh uh let me go
[2:50:39] there. He said, let's take our our time.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; It was where? Okay. Uh are you in hurry?
[2:50:47] No.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; No. [laughter]
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; I don't wait for your answer, please.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; I just respond for you. No.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; Are you near? No. Let's take our time.
[2:51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, prophet. Let's take our time.
[2:51:08] Amen. Amen. And and and
[2:51:12] try to make it just as clear as I can.
[2:51:21] So this means it's important.
[2:51:24] Now when we come along
[2:51:28] we remember
[2:51:30] that we live here in three dimensions.
[2:51:37] You know that there are three dimensions
[2:51:39] here.
[2:51:41] We are living simultaneously in three
[2:51:44] dimension.
[2:51:48] And the prophet says I don't know
[2:51:50] whether I can name them or not.
[2:51:55] You can prophet.
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; One of them is
[2:52:01] amen. Amen.
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; And the other is matter.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; So the light is also a dimension.
[2:52:12] Light is a dimension.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; And anything that you can touch is also
[2:52:17] a dimension.
[2:52:20] Dimension.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; Matter is a dimension.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; Matter dimension.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; Tommy.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; You remember what the third is?
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; Someone say something.
[2:52:34] He say,
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; someone says time. The prophet say time.
[2:52:40] So we are living here with three
[2:52:43] dimensions.
[2:52:46] The first one is life.
[2:52:49] The second is matter
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; and the third one is time.
[2:52:57] So when your time to leave this earth
[2:53:02] come,
[2:53:07] when you start your journey to the sixth
[2:53:10] dimension
[2:53:14] to be gathered there,
[2:53:17] you must leave the three diamonds.
[2:53:22] So now you must understand how this
[2:53:25] happened.
[2:53:28] When you live here,
[2:53:31] first dimension you are living
[2:53:34] will be light.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; Every light
[2:53:42] will shut off
[2:53:45] when you are living.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; But be courageous.
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; That won't last long.
[2:53:56] Every light,
[2:53:59] artificial light
[2:54:06] will shut off.
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; Even the natural light also,
[2:54:12] the sun, the moon, the stars
[2:54:16] off.
[2:54:18] That's the first thing that we are.
[2:54:21] and you'll get into the darkness.
[2:54:24] Even when God was created the earth
[2:54:28] is started by the night,
[2:54:32] the night
[2:54:34] is announcing
[2:54:37] light.
[2:54:40] There cannot be light
[2:54:43] unless the darkness comes through.
[2:54:47] That's why sometimes the dark days
[2:54:52] announce the sunny days.
[2:54:58] Now you are crying
[2:55:00] but tomorrow you will be rejoicing.
[2:55:05] Hallelujah.
[2:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; It starts by the evening.
[2:55:11] There was a night. There was an evening.
[2:55:15] Then there was a day and God called it
[2:55:20] the first day. Amen. Amen.
[2:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; LIGHTS
[2:55:27] WILL shut off.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Then you got you get in the dark.
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; That means you just left the first
[2:55:35] dimension.
[2:55:39] &gt;&gt; The second dimension
[2:55:42] you are going to leave
[2:55:44] is matter.
[2:55:46] You will lose the sensitivity of your
[2:55:49] body.
[2:55:53] It may start by the tools up to the hell
[2:55:59] or from the the hell to the to
[2:56:07] you could not feel yourself.
[2:56:10] That means you have just left the second
[2:56:13] side.
[2:56:16] THEN THE THIRD ONE IS time and the
[2:56:20] doctor will come
[2:56:23] and write somewhere
[2:56:27] brother sister who and who
[2:56:31] has died
[2:56:34] 12
[2:56:37] &gt;&gt; the 7th of November.
[2:56:41] So the calendar
[2:56:44] just ain't there for you.
[2:56:48] That will mean you just left the third
[2:56:52] DIMENSION DIMENSION WHICH IS TIME.
[2:57:00] Time will no more be for you
[2:57:06] because time is a dimension.
[2:57:11] Can I go on?
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; okay time.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; And our five senses contact them
[2:57:20] dimensions
[2:57:27] our feeling
[2:57:30] matters.
[2:57:34] Let's go on now. But we have a contact
[2:57:37] through science.
[2:57:41] That's the fourth dimension dimension
[2:57:44] as it was because coming right through
[2:57:49] this building
[2:57:52] comes pictures
[2:57:55] voices of radio.
[2:57:58] pictures on television.
[2:58:02] Our senses does not contact
[2:58:06] but yet they have a tube that picks up
[2:58:11] those
[2:58:15] waves
[2:58:17] and manifest them.
[2:58:20] The fourth dimension dimension
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; is the dimension of waves dimension wave
[2:58:28] there are images
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; it's a dimension
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; so you see
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; right in this building
[2:58:44] now is life actions of people
[2:58:49] in the Yeah.
[2:58:52] Live voices,
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; they are here.
[2:58:57] &gt;&gt; We know it.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says somewhere,
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; if you say something against someone,
[2:59:05] your voice live on.
[2:59:11] It will go all over the world
[2:59:16] then return to you.
[2:59:19] It lives on.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; And the only way to stop it,
[2:59:26] to erase it
[2:59:28] in the board of God
[2:59:32] is to make it right.
[2:59:38] [applause and cheering]
[2:59:38] Amen.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; So, confess it.
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says,
[2:59:44] &gt;&gt; "Confess it exactly like you said it.
[2:59:53] One weakness I saw in the church is not
[2:59:57] be able to say I'm wrong.
[3:00:10] That was not good.
[3:00:13] Be as a Christian
[3:00:16] to say I'm wrong.
[3:00:20] I'm sorry.
[3:00:23] I should not have done it.
[3:00:27] Forgive me. And that's all.
[3:00:31] That's all.
[3:00:33] Make it a practice in your life.
[3:00:38] We are not angels.
[3:00:41] We are human beings.
[3:00:44] [applause and cheering]
[3:00:46] We make heroes. We make fools.
[3:00:49] We are human beings
[3:00:51] and God knows it.
[3:00:55] But as a Christian,
[3:00:58] you must repent
[3:01:01] and confess.
[3:01:03] I'm sorry, brother.
[3:01:06] I'm sorry, SISTER.
[3:01:08] AND THAT'S ALL.
[3:01:12] &gt;&gt; When you say that, the prophet says when
[3:01:14] someone ask for forgiveness, you must
[3:01:17] forgive.
[3:01:23] And when you forgive,
[3:01:26] he still your brother.
[3:01:29] Amen.
[3:01:31] Don't keep any grief in your heart.
[3:01:36] How you say? Yeah.
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; Don't keep in your heart.
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; So
[3:01:46] the voices
[3:01:49] &gt;&gt; are living in the fourth dimension.
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; Make it right.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; I learned this the hard way for myself.
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; The hard way.
[3:02:07] I I just I I was just young
[3:02:11] just received the message
[3:02:13] and I read it in the message prophet
[3:02:16] says go to your brother
[3:02:19] go to your sister don't say to anyone
[3:02:23] go to him
[3:02:27] and I said something very bad about that
[3:02:29] a man
[3:02:32] and that man was a polit politician
[3:02:37] because we we we knew in a family we
[3:02:40] have some relationship.
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; I said to myself how to repay it.
[3:02:49] I have to go to find that man.
[3:02:53] He was a Catholic. He was he was a
[3:02:54] Catholic praying somewhere in.
[3:03:00] And I go to that place
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; because you know there they have the the
[3:03:05] the cult in the service in early in the
[3:03:07] morning
[3:03:10] 56 I go there
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; and I met him I said oh what are you
[3:03:15] doing here
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; he was so surprised to see me
[3:03:19] I say I have something to say
[3:03:22] I said okay what's going on say I say
[3:03:25] this this this against you but it's not
[3:03:28] itever
[3:03:30] I just come to say forgive me for
[3:03:35] no there's nothing that no it's okay
[3:03:39] it was okay for him but it was not okay
[3:03:42] for me
[3:03:47] and since that time
[3:03:50] I keep my mouth
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want it anymore
[3:03:57] if I have something against you.
[3:04:00] I tell you right now,
[3:04:03] that's how it works.
[3:04:05] I'll go straight to you.
[3:04:09] &gt;&gt; If I don't say anything straight to you,
[3:04:13] don't imagine that I have something
[3:04:14] against you now.
[3:04:19] I heard it. I go to
[3:04:23] it
[3:04:25] and finish that book. Amen.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our sermon.
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; he says, you know, I don't understand
[3:04:42] the mechanics of those things that
[3:04:44] science has invented.
[3:04:50] We know that it proves to us there is a
[3:04:52] fourth dimension.
[3:04:57] So when you leave this earth
[3:05:01] you go through dimensions
[3:05:04] to be gathered to the sixth
[3:05:09] of second matter. You lose sensitivity
[3:05:15] of your senses.
[3:05:17] You lose them. Then you go to the time
[3:05:23] stop for you. No calendar, no nothing.
[3:05:27] They will put on your tomb
[3:05:30] the day you stop living in a time.
[3:05:36] That means time stops for you
[3:05:40] at that time. Then you go on and the
[3:05:44] fourth now the waves
[3:05:47] and those things You must go there.
[3:05:50] Then you reach the fifth. The prophet
[3:05:54] says, "Now the fifth dimension
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; is where the sinner,
[3:06:00] &gt;&gt; the unbeliever
[3:06:03] dies and goes to
[3:06:07] the fifth dimension
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; is the kind of of the horrible
[3:06:12] dimension.
[3:06:15] horrible dimension dimension
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; is the thief.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; It's called also the the the how do you
[3:06:23] call it in English the the hell
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; yeahis hell
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; the hell
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; yeah in French they say they say
[3:06:34] or something okay hell
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; hell
[3:06:37] when you die as unbeliever
[3:06:43] You will leave also the first dimension.
[3:06:48] You leave the first dimension
[3:06:51] leave it. Every human being
[3:06:55] then the second then the third then the
[3:06:58] fourth and then when you reach the fifth
[3:07:03] that's hell.
[3:07:07] Big doors will open to you.
[3:07:12] and receive you in that dimension
[3:07:16] that horrible dimension dimension. And
[3:07:19] when you get there, the door will close
[3:07:22] after you
[3:07:27] [clears throat]
[3:07:27] to prevent you for that.
[3:07:32] Jesus said to Peter,
[3:07:35] &gt;&gt; "Who do you say that I, the son of man,
[3:07:40] is
[3:07:44] Peter said,
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; you are Christ,
[3:07:48] &gt;&gt; the son of God,
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said,
[3:07:52] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[3:07:53] &gt;&gt; it's not the flesh and blood,
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; no pastor,
[3:08:00] &gt;&gt; no one who has just revealed this to
[3:08:03] you,
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; the revelation of who I am.
[3:08:13] Upon this revelation,
[3:08:17] upon this rock,
[3:08:20] upon the revelation of myself,
[3:08:26] I will build my church.
[3:08:31] And the doors
[3:08:35] of HELL
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; SHALL not prevail
[3:08:40] against it.
[3:08:45] Amen. If you are a believer,
[3:08:48] if you have the revelation
[3:08:51] who the son of man is
[3:08:56] the revelation
[3:08:58] of the flesh
[3:09:00] that Elohim
[3:09:03] is using
[3:09:05] in the time that you are living, IF YOU
[3:09:08] HAVE THAT REVELATION
[3:09:10] WHEN YOU REACH the fifth dimension, THE
[3:09:13] GO
[3:09:17] WILL NOT PREVAIL
[3:09:20] AGAINST YOU
[3:09:22] PASS THE DOOR.
[3:09:26] So the the the key,
[3:09:29] the secrets to prevail
[3:09:33] when you reach that horrible dimension
[3:09:36] is to receive the revelation now.
[3:09:43] When you are still alive,
[3:09:46] because when YOU DIE, THERE IS NO
[3:09:49] POSSIBILITY
[3:09:50] FOR YOU TO PREVAIL
[3:09:54] THE GATES OF HELL. YOU WILL GET THAT
[3:09:57] DAY.
[3:10:07] &gt;&gt; Horrible dimension.
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; Dimension is
[3:10:11] the prophet went there.
[3:10:14] &gt;&gt; You know that story.
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When he was disobeying,
[3:10:19] &gt;&gt; God put him there. He said when I was
[3:10:23] dead, there was no mama there. There was
[3:10:26] no papa there. There was no God there.
[3:10:30] THERE WAS NO NOTHING THERE. ONLY
[3:10:32] HORRIBLE CREATURES
[3:10:38] IN THE DARKNESS FOREVER. THAT'S HOW
[3:10:42] PEOPLE ESCAPE FROM THAT PLACE.
[3:10:46] HOW? by receiving the revelation of the
[3:10:50] son of man.
[3:10:52] [applause]
[3:10:53] THE REVELATION OF GOD IN THE FLESH,
[3:10:58] GOD [screaming] IN THE FLESH IS THE
[3:11:01] POWER
[3:11:05] to prevail
[3:11:07] the gates of hell.
[3:11:13] And the prophecy in that place
[3:11:16] there is no flow.
[3:11:20] It's just like how do you call the P in
[3:11:23] English?
[3:11:25] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; Bottomless piece.
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; Bottomless beast.
[3:11:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:11:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:11:31] It's it's a bottomless piece.
[3:11:35] Can you imagine? You are there for years
[3:11:38] and years and years
[3:11:41] in a place where there is no flow
[3:11:46] and you see horrible creatures
[3:11:49] going there. THEY WILL EVEN FIGHT
[3:11:52] AGAINST YOU. THEY WILL EVEN THEY TOUCH
[3:11:55] YOU, TRY TO KILL YOU, but you won't be
[3:11:59] dead
[3:12:01] because you are already dead because of
[3:12:04] your own
[3:12:04] &gt;&gt; already dead. day.
[3:12:08] Yes. Amen. They they could not kill you
[3:12:12] for the second time because you already
[3:12:19] but they can harm you.
[3:12:25] The prophet says
[3:12:28] this place escape from this place.
[3:12:34] &gt;&gt; Being a church members
[3:12:36] is not enough.
[3:12:42] Reading the message
[3:12:44] &gt;&gt; is not enough.
[3:12:46] &gt;&gt; Listening to tapes
[3:12:47] &gt;&gt; is not enough.
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; Receiving the revelation
[3:12:52] is the key.
[3:12:56] The revelation,
[3:12:58] &gt;&gt; not what you read,
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; but what is in what you are reading.
[3:13:05] There is a message in the message.
[3:13:08] There is a voice in the voice.
[3:13:12] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why there was a
[3:13:15] silence
[3:13:16] because anyone who received the
[3:13:18] revelation must get to that sixth
[3:13:20] DIMENSION
[3:13:26] because the true church of God
[3:13:30] is built
[3:13:32] upon the revelation
[3:13:35] and revelation means the word in the
[3:13:39] flesh.
[3:13:42] The word out of the flesh
[3:13:46] is no more a revelation.
[3:13:50] But when you take that word, you see it
[3:13:53] in the flesh, then you receive the
[3:13:56] revelation
[3:13:58] because God here on earth can only be
[3:14:03] seen
[3:14:04] by human beings.
[3:14:08] You reject the man.
[3:14:11] You reject God.
[3:14:14] You reject Noah.
[3:14:16] You reject God. YOU REJECT MOSES. YOU
[3:14:21] REJECT GOD. YOU REJECT JESUS. YOU REJECT
[3:14:25] GOD. YOU REJECT THE PROPHET. YOU REJECT
[3:14:29] GOD. YOU REJECT.
[3:14:36] AMEN.
[3:14:38] YOU REJECT [screaming] TO GOD.
[3:14:42] [laughter]
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; You know
[3:14:46] human beings
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; are the flesh of God. Amen.
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; You won't never ever see God.
[3:15:01] But the people that God ARE USING
[3:15:08] AND WHEN YOU reject those people,
[3:15:11] you reject God.
[3:15:16] &gt;&gt; And that's a revelation.
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was there
[3:15:28] at the funeral,
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; when my father
[3:15:36] was there in that coffin.
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; And I looked at the pastors that were
[3:15:43] present there
[3:15:47] and I realized
[3:15:51] that the people of God are very few.
[3:16:01] Let me say this, maybe it's personal.
[3:16:06] If someone has not seen God in pasta
[3:16:14] to honor his burial,
[3:16:18] that man
[3:16:20] is not of God.
[3:16:30] It was painful for me.
[3:16:33] to realize that
[3:16:36] the church of God in South Africa
[3:16:39] were absent.
[3:16:44] They did not believe [snorts]
[3:16:46] those thing that pastor was preaching
[3:16:48] all of these days.
[3:16:54] They would get stuck in the fifth
[3:16:56] dimension.
[3:17:00] Believe me,
[3:17:02] they will get stuck there.
[3:17:05] You know, anyone who has God in his
[3:17:08] heart
[3:17:11] will always recognize God in the heart
[3:17:14] of another.
[3:17:21] Yeah.
[3:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's the way I use myself to know who
[3:17:26] is who.
[3:17:31] Humbly
[3:17:34] I know who I am.
[3:17:37] &gt;&gt; If you don't love me, I know who you
[3:17:40] are.
[3:17:43] [applause]
[3:17:48] Let's go on.
[3:17:50] Hallelujah.
[3:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:17:59] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says when a Christian
[3:18:02] dies
[3:18:04] he goes into the sixth dimension.
[3:18:09] Amen.
[3:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:11] &gt;&gt; Because a Christian
[3:18:13] means someone who believe Christ.
[3:18:19] &gt;&gt; To believe Christ is different from to
[3:18:21] believe Jesus.
[3:18:26] Christ means a man anointed.
[3:18:34] When God put his anointing on a man
[3:18:38] and you believe that man,
[3:18:40] you are a true Christian.
[3:18:45] And a Christian
[3:18:47] when he dies, he goes into THE SIXTH
[3:18:50] DIMENSION.
[3:18:52] BECAUSE IN THAT SIXTH DIMENSION,
[3:18:54] HE WON'T MEET JESUS,
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; but he won't meet human beings
[3:19:01] who were anointed with God.
[3:19:12] Let me explain it.
[3:19:14] There is a language barrier. I'm I'm I'm
[3:19:16] fighting to have the good word, the best
[3:19:18] way to explain Listen.
[3:19:22] Amen.
[3:19:23] &gt;&gt; You know when when you are on earth,
[3:19:27] &gt;&gt; we preach you Jesus Christ
[3:19:32] &gt;&gt; and you believe in him.
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; You see?
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:35] &gt;&gt; But when you you arrive at sixth
[3:19:37] dimension,
[3:19:39] you will be there
[3:19:42] because you believe the word coming from
[3:19:44] a man.
[3:19:50] Amen.
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; This part don't don't receive it.
[3:19:56] &gt;&gt; There's a problem here.
[3:19:59] [laughter]
[3:20:05] Let me speak it again.
[3:20:08] When the prophet arrived there
[3:20:12] in the sixth dimension,
[3:20:14] do you remember what the brothers and
[3:20:16] sister told him?
[3:20:20] They said to him,
[3:20:22] "If you
[3:20:25] were not here,
[3:20:28] we could not
[3:20:30] arrive here.
[3:20:33] It's because of what YOU
[3:20:37] shall then we are here.
[3:20:43] [applause and cheering]
[3:20:48] WE ARE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF JESUS BUT
[3:20:52] BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU
[3:20:55] A human being.
[3:20:57] [laughter]
[3:20:58] Amen. [applause]
[3:21:03] [cheering]
[3:21:05] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL MAKE IT.
[3:21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:21:08] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL MAKE IT TO THIS PLACE.
[3:21:10] I CAN FEEL IT. YOU WILL BE THERE.
[3:21:15] THE PROPHET SAY I SAW YOU THERE.
[3:21:17] [screaming]
[3:21:22] [cheering]
[3:21:23] I feel that I feel the sixth DIMENSION
[3:21:27] VIBRATING IN MY HEART.
[3:21:30] YOU ARE A PART OF that dimension
[3:21:33] BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN GOD IN A MAN.
[3:21:36] AMEN.
[3:21:39] That's a Christian.
[3:21:44] Even you know even the prophet himself
[3:21:47] he was so disturbed
[3:21:51] said why are you all of you say precious
[3:21:53] brother
[3:21:55] hey no I want to see Jesus he said no
[3:21:59] he's not here oh
[3:22:02] and they they took the prophet
[3:22:06] and they they put him on the higher
[3:22:08] place
[3:22:10] and said you sit there people say why
[3:22:14] on earth. You are a leader.
[3:22:19] [cheering]
[3:22:20] Amen. YOU WILL BE GATHERED in the sixth
[3:22:23] DIMENSION WITH YOUR LEADER.
[3:22:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:22:34] That's Christianity.
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] Woo. Jesus. [applause]
[3:22:55] When when a Christian dies,
[3:22:58] he goes into the sixth dimension.
[3:23:02] And God is in the dimension.
[3:23:07] Do you see it's a different dimension?
[3:23:11] dimension is a world dimension
[3:23:15] &gt;&gt; and you don't go to the seven
[3:23:19] who see Jesus but you go to the SIXTH
[3:23:25] with your
[3:23:29] Amen
[3:23:34] then you see
[3:23:36] &gt;&gt; the Christian
[3:23:37] &gt;&gt; when he dies he goes under the altar of
[3:23:40] God
[3:23:44] right into the presence of God under the
[3:23:47] altar.
[3:23:51] The altar is the seven
[3:23:56] &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD IS. BUT WHEN you dies, you
[3:24:00] don't go on THE ALTAR
[3:24:04] under the ALTAR
[3:24:08] and then you receive rest.
[3:24:17] Amen.
[3:24:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet goes on
[3:24:20] 25. He said to break it down,
[3:24:24] he want to explain it better.
[3:24:27] When a man has a nightmare,
[3:24:31] nightmare. Nightmare.
[3:24:34] Amen.
[3:24:35] &gt;&gt; I used to have nightmares
[3:24:38] when I was a kid. I could see myself in
[3:24:41] a forest
[3:24:43] in the darkness AND SOMEONE FOLLOWING ME
[3:24:47] following me and I was running. Then
[3:24:50] when he just about to TAKE ME,
[3:24:54] THEN I raise up.
[3:24:59] But in that fifth dimension
[3:25:03] you will have nightmare
[3:25:06] nightmare upper nightmare.
[3:25:09] But the difference
[3:25:11] you want to woke up
[3:25:16] that man running against behind you will
[3:25:18] catch you.
[3:25:22] [laughter]
[3:25:27] nightmare.
[3:25:29] &gt;&gt; He's not all together asleep.
[3:25:32] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[3:25:33] &gt;&gt; He's not okay together asleep and have a
[3:25:37] nightmare.
[3:25:39] Neither is he awake.
[3:25:42] He's between
[3:25:44] sleep.
[3:25:46] And that's what makes him have a
[3:25:48] horrible shaking and screaming.
[3:25:53] because he's not asleep. He's not awake.
[3:25:57] And to take that shows where a man goes
[3:26:02] when he dies unconverted.
[3:26:11] Amen.
[3:26:11] &gt;&gt; When you die unconverted,
[3:26:15] you'll be stuck somewhere
[3:26:19] in the fifth dimension.
[3:26:21] The prophet says he has lived his time
[3:26:24] up.
[3:26:27] His time is finished here. He is dead on
[3:26:30] earth
[3:26:32] and he cannot go in the prisons of God
[3:26:36] because he's not FIT TO GO THERE
[3:26:40] without the blood.
[3:26:44] The blood is the life of God.
[3:26:48] The blood is the message of your hour.
[3:26:54] If you DON'T HAVE THE BLOOD, YOU WILL BE
[3:26:57] GET STUCK IN THAT FIFTH DIMENSION.
[3:27:03] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And his court
[3:27:06] cannot come back to earth
[3:27:09] because his time is finished
[3:27:12] here on earth. He's caught between
[3:27:17] and he's in a nightmare.
[3:27:19] You see, he can go in the presence of
[3:27:22] God
[3:27:24] to rest AND HE CAN'T GET BACK to earth
[3:27:28] because his time is up.
[3:27:30] He's in a nightmare
[3:27:33] and there
[3:27:35] he stays
[3:27:36] until the day OF THE JUDGMENT.
[3:27:40] A HORRIBLE THING TO BE IN.
[3:27:47] HALLELUJAH.
[3:27:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:27:48] &gt;&gt; And now
[3:27:51] &gt;&gt; 26. And now
[3:27:54] &gt;&gt; in this vision,
[3:27:57] &gt;&gt; I believe I was caught into that sixth
[3:28:01] dimension.
[3:28:05] Looking back down here
[3:28:09] and could see back,
[3:28:11] see Besides
[3:28:14] &gt;&gt; is not exactly with the eyes.
[3:28:19] Amen.
[3:28:20] &gt;&gt; The sides is not with the eyes.
[3:28:24] &gt;&gt; That's earthly
[3:28:26] besides is a greater thing than
[3:28:30] THE
[3:28:34] contact is far BEYOND
[3:28:38] any contact that our natural senses will
[3:28:46] You know sometime we were talking with
[3:28:47] pastor about some supernatural things
[3:28:54] and we he he he was speaking about the
[3:28:57] pastor here
[3:28:59] in South Africa who is going far from
[3:29:02] him because he doesn't understand those
[3:29:04] things
[3:29:07] and I told him you know those things
[3:29:10] that you are experiencing
[3:29:14] is not for everybody.
[3:29:19] Only if you are supernatural, you can
[3:29:22] understand the supernatural.
[3:29:27] Some of us, even you, I know
[3:29:30] some of us and you and me and the
[3:29:33] pastor, we have some supernatural
[3:29:36] experience we cannot even EXPLAIN TO
[3:29:38] PEOPLE.
[3:29:42] MYSELF. I've been in some experiences
[3:29:44] when I explain to that people start to
[3:29:47] look at me differently.
[3:29:55] I don't want people to look at me
[3:29:57] differently.
[3:30:02] I'm your brother.
[3:30:04] Love me, please.
[3:30:12] You see when the prophet when his wife
[3:30:15] dies,
[3:30:17] sister Ma
[3:30:19] &gt;&gt; Sister Mida went back on the womb where
[3:30:21] the prophet was sleeping
[3:30:27] some
[3:30:30] who knows that
[3:30:32] just
[3:30:34] okay let me explain
[3:30:37] Sister
[3:30:40] went
[3:30:41] &gt;&gt; after he died
[3:30:43] in the bedroom
[3:30:46] and touched the prophet
[3:30:50] &gt;&gt; and spoke to him
[3:30:54] [laughter]
[3:30:56] and said
[3:30:58] you have to promise me
[3:31:00] you get married.
[3:31:02] Don't stay like this.
[3:31:05] you need a partner
[3:31:07] promise me and the prophet said no I
[3:31:10] cannot
[3:31:12] say no promise
[3:31:14] and then the prophet say I promise I
[3:31:17] will get married then she left and the
[3:31:22] prophet went to look for the light
[3:31:24] switch the light
[3:31:27] he said it was not a vision
[3:31:30] the prophet said it was not a VISION SHE
[3:31:34] WAS
[3:31:39] SO don't be afraid
[3:31:42] if someone told you that Pastor Kima
[3:31:45] visited me in the night.
[3:31:52] Don't be afraid.
[3:31:56] Don't be afraid.
[3:32:00] &gt;&gt; When I lost my mother,
[3:32:04] It was so painful.
[3:32:06] I was crying crying and one day I went
[3:32:11] to my bedroom.
[3:32:13] My wife was was not there and I cried
[3:32:19] because my mother left me. I was just 10
[3:32:25] and she divorced with my father
[3:32:29] and he dies. She dies and I cried.
[3:32:33] And after that
[3:32:35] I finish crying
[3:32:38] &gt;&gt; and I go back to the living room and I
[3:32:40] stay there.
[3:32:42] I told it to anyone.
[3:32:46] Not even my wife knew that I was in that
[3:32:49] condition.
[3:32:54] Then in the night when I slept
[3:32:57] at around 5 a.m.
[3:33:01] my phone rings
[3:33:04] a sister of the church called me.
[3:33:08] She had no
[3:33:11] capacity of knowing nothing about what
[3:33:13] happened in the night.
[3:33:18] She said to me, "This night your mother
[3:33:22] come to my bedroom."
[3:33:26] She was there
[3:33:28] and she told me,
[3:33:32] "Tell your pastor
[3:33:34] to stop crying.
[3:33:37] I'm always with them in the house.
[3:33:44] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:33:48] &gt;&gt; That's why
[3:33:50] I respect
[3:33:53] &gt;&gt; your message.
[3:33:55] The message you address it to your
[3:33:57] husband.
[3:33:59] I respect your spirituality.
[3:34:05] You know what you are talking about.
[3:34:08] I respect it.
[3:34:11] You know what you are talking about.
[3:34:14] You cannot be a wife on a man like
[3:34:18] pastor
[3:34:21] who don't have the same caliber.
[3:34:30] Let me let me go on and close.
[3:34:35] I still have two hours.
[3:34:38] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[3:34:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[3:34:46] &gt;&gt; when I was I was there I was wearing
[3:34:50] okay
[3:34:51] now
[3:34:53] &gt;&gt; there are three bodies
[3:34:56] let me give you something now
[3:34:59] you know the prophet says
[3:35:01] &gt;&gt; there are three different bodies
[3:35:05] the body that you are living with here
[3:35:10] a mortal body,
[3:35:12] a physical body.
[3:35:15] It's it's just for these three
[3:35:17] dimensions.
[3:35:20] &gt;&gt; You cannot change dimension and go with
[3:35:23] this body.
[3:35:27] Because every dimension has conditions
[3:35:34] changing dimension
[3:35:37] changing the bodies.
[3:35:41] That's why when you leave here,
[3:35:45] we'll take your bodies
[3:35:48] and we put it in a coffin
[3:35:51] and put it under
[3:35:53] under there.
[3:35:55] But you are not there
[3:35:58] because when this body is destroyed,
[3:36:02] we have another one.
[3:36:06] It's just dwelling places.
[3:36:11] The body we take
[3:36:14] when we go from here to the sixth
[3:36:16] dimension
[3:36:18] is called a celestial body.
[3:36:25] A celestial body is called also
[3:36:28] theophony.
[3:36:32] Theophony
[3:36:34] means a word body.
[3:36:39] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:36:41] &gt;&gt; And this body
[3:36:43] is celestial,
[3:36:47] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN TOUCH IT.
[3:36:49] YOU CAN FEEL IT. But it's different from
[3:36:53] this body.
[3:36:56] Amen. Amen. And then WHEN YOU COME BACK
[3:37:01] at the day of resurrection,
[3:37:05] you come back from the celestial body.
[3:37:11] Getting back here,
[3:37:13] you must mix that celestial body with
[3:37:17] the natural BODY
[3:37:22] to have what we call glorified
[3:37:25] body.
[3:37:31] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:37:33] &gt;&gt; So you have three different bodies.
[3:37:37] The first one is a natural body. It's
[3:37:40] very limited.
[3:37:44] So weak and feeble.
[3:37:47] Yes. Amen. You do things and you regret
[3:37:50] after.
[3:37:52] But in your heart you say, "Oh, I SHOULD
[3:37:54] NOT HAVE DONE IT.
[3:37:57] BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A NATURAL BODY. BUT I
[3:38:00] TELL YOU SOMETHING, one of these days,
[3:38:03] you're going to LEAVE THAT NATURAL BODY
[3:38:06] TO GET ANOTHER BODY
[3:38:09] changing
[3:38:10] dimension.
[3:38:13] Amen. And that celestial body
[3:38:19] when the prophet arrived there,
[3:38:22] people said to him, "With this celestial
[3:38:25] body,
[3:38:26] We cannot eat
[3:38:29] and sleep.
[3:38:32] So it's also limited
[3:38:35] TO THE PROPHET. WHEN JESUS COMES,
[3:38:39] he will come to you
[3:38:42] and then we shall RETURN
[3:38:46] TO earth changing the body
[3:38:50] so that we'll eat again.
[3:38:57] Hallelujah.
[3:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:38:59] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet says.
[3:39:02] &gt;&gt; Let me go on now. I'm almost finished.
[3:39:06] &gt;&gt; God's only provided place of worship.
[3:39:12] &gt;&gt; God's only provided with his own
[3:39:13] worship.
[3:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:16] The prophet said,
[3:39:18] &gt;&gt; "We see every other thing moving right
[3:39:21] to up to this side.
[3:39:26] We see the scripture being vindicated,
[3:39:29] proved. And just as we see that
[3:39:34] with our own eyes being made manifest
[3:39:40] someday
[3:39:42] there will be a rapture.
[3:39:45] Hallelujah. AMEN. SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE
[3:39:48] A RAPTURE AND WE'LL SEE THE
[3:39:50] MANIFESTATION.
[3:39:53] OF THAT WAY. For the Son of man
[3:39:57] shall COME IN THE CLOUDS OF GLORY
[3:40:01] with his holy angels
[3:40:04] with him and we will be caught up to
[3:40:08] meet him in the air.
[3:40:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:40:13] &gt;&gt; Then we see it with our own eyes.
[3:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rapture.
[3:40:23] Rapture is just ahead of us.
[3:40:27] We are almost there, people of God.
[3:40:31] We are almost there.
[3:40:33] God is making last arrangement.
[3:40:37] He is teaching you the last THING TO
[3:40:39] KNOW.
[3:40:41] IS EQUIPPING YOU SO THAT YOU MUST BE
[3:40:44] READY. WHEN THAT TIME COMES TO MEET HIM
[3:40:48] IN THE AIR,
[3:40:50] there will be A MEETING IN THE AIR.
[3:40:54] You must know what does it means.
[3:41:01] Listen to what the prophet says.
[3:41:04] Question answers question and answers.
[3:41:08] &gt;&gt; Part three.
[3:41:09] &gt;&gt; Part three. 257.
[3:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:41:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet say this
[3:41:17] &gt;&gt; please quickly quickly I don't have
[3:41:18] enough time now. Okay. The prophet says
[3:41:21] and look
[3:41:23] &gt;&gt; he's talking about Rebecca
[3:41:26] &gt;&gt; when Rebecca was going to Isaac
[3:41:32] &gt;&gt; and Elazar
[3:41:34] &gt;&gt; was going with Rebecca
[3:41:38] &gt;&gt; and to Isaac.
[3:41:41] And the prophet says when seen him
[3:41:48] heart was so full of joy,
[3:41:51] she did not know who she was going to
[3:41:54] marry.
[3:41:57] All of those ages
[3:42:00] the preachers preached to us
[3:42:04] that Jesus Christ is our Mary, our our
[3:42:08] husband. and we're going to marry him.
[3:42:11] But we didn't know exactly
[3:42:13] what will happen.
[3:42:15] We are so many
[3:42:18] to meet Jesus. What does it mean?
[3:42:22] [laughter]
[3:42:25] Amen.
[3:42:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "But by faith, the
[3:42:30] prophet say amen."
[3:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and balance and and remember
[3:42:37] Jesus will live the kingdom
[3:42:42] and will will not meet him in glory.
[3:42:51] We not meet him in glory.
[3:42:55] We are to meet him in the air.
[3:43:00] What does it mean brother? The process
[3:43:03] says
[3:43:04] between
[3:43:06] heaven and earth where it's expanded to
[3:43:11] redeem us
[3:43:16] in
[3:43:18] a space
[3:43:20] expense to redeem US
[3:43:26] and where heaven we don't meet HIM IN
[3:43:29] HEAVEN.
[3:43:31] WE DON'T MEET HIM ON EARTH, BUT WE MEET
[3:43:34] HIM SOMEWHERE.
[3:43:36] [laughter] AMEN.
[3:43:38] [applause and cheering]
[3:43:41] In the air
[3:43:44] does it mean
[3:43:47] explain to us. We want to know exactly.
[3:43:51] He said, "And he met Rebecca
[3:43:56] in the middle between a hole
[3:44:00] and his home." Isaac went out of his
[3:44:05] home.
[3:44:06] And Rebecca went out of his and they met
[3:44:11] someone.
[3:44:12] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[3:44:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE RAPTURE.
[3:44:20] Even in the Bible they say men shall
[3:44:23] leave

[3:44:30] go to the hus the wife. You see, amen.
[3:44:34] You cannot go there to meet him in the
[3:44:37] seventh dimension.

[3:44:42] because it's a man who GOES TO THE WIFE.
[3:44:47] But the wife must get out of his own.
[3:44:55] Amen.

[3:49:25] in which you receive the message
[3:49:29] is the body that God must claim.
[3:49:38] But the difference with that natural
[3:49:40] body,

[3:53:11] well-being
[3:53:13] in whatever form.
[3:53:17] for the love.
[3:53:20] The support has been expressed in the
[3:53:22] name of the body of our beloved brother,
[3:53:26] father,

[3:53:36] I would a special thank to you pastor
[3:53:43] for heading to the core of our beloved
[3:53:45] pastor
[3:53:47] to stand in the gap.
[3:53:51] uh as it was alluded yesterday in the
[3:53:53] testimony of brother Metsa
[3:53:57] that the pastor was already
[3:54:00] seeing beyond
[3:54:02] the curtain of time
[3:54:06] during his hospital admission in July
[3:54:09] this year.
[3:54:12] There he laid out his wishes in terms of
[3:54:15] funeral and should be conducted.
[3:54:22] A special thank you for the following
[3:54:29] assembly.
[3:54:32] The support expressed by the church
[3:54:33] during the pastor's physical absence
[3:54:35] from the church over the past months.
[3:54:42] Your efforts were not in vain
[3:54:46] but what you have done to for the pastor
[3:54:50] is registered in heaven.
[3:54:54] Pastor MBA and pastor
[3:54:57] for healing to the call of a beloved
[3:54:58] pastor

[3:55:33] for relentless contributions
[3:55:38] every time when he hears the pastor he's
[3:55:40] not well

[3:55:44] flight available
[3:55:48] and come to see the pastor.
[3:55:51] God bless you.
[3:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55:55] I wouldn't stay in Ma when the pastor is
[3:55:57] in the hospital.
[3:56:00] I didn't trust the doctors very much.
[3:56:10] Let me verify one thing
[3:56:15] &gt;&gt; which said
[3:56:22] this thing
[3:56:23] &gt;&gt; which the pastor rebuked us before
[3:56:26] brother.
[3:56:32] &gt;&gt; Me and Dr. Moshabi had just coming in
[3:56:34] before the family comes in
[3:56:39] says how where am I?
[3:56:41] &gt;&gt; So there was a big glass looking
[3:56:44] outside.
[3:56:48] So he was telling me and
[3:56:52] &gt;&gt; I saw new Jerusalem.
[3:56:57] Me and Moab they didn't react. We just
[3:56:59] stood.
[3:57:06] You see these people don't believe me.
[3:57:18] &gt;&gt; That was true.
[3:57:20] &gt;&gt; I forgot
[3:57:22] my my friend Mohabi was still
[3:57:24] remembering
[3:57:26] that day. He told us that he saw new
[3:57:29] Jerusalem.
[3:57:32] Amen. Amen.

[3:57:42] &gt;&gt; He saw new Jerusalem.
[3:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are also not believing
[3:57:53] to all pastors
[3:57:55] and elders both locally and globally.
[3:58:00] We cannot find ways to express our
[3:58:02] gratitude.
[3:58:04] Pastor said
[3:58:07] he will we are his sons and daughters.
[3:58:12] I am going to heaven but Jesus is
[3:58:15] coming.
[3:58:16] Wait for Jesus.
[3:58:19] &gt;&gt; The last words of pastor,
[3:58:23] God is God.

[3:58:55] and he comes here to speak the same
[3:58:57] things I told you.
[3:59:00] &gt;&gt; There's no better church
[3:59:04] than this one.
[3:59:11] &gt;&gt; So if I hear that you have gone away
[3:59:13] from here
[3:59:15] I know that you have gone to a bad
[3:59:17] church.
[3:59:21] This is the best church.
[3:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:59:29] &gt;&gt; And
