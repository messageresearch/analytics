[58:52] shalom saying i'm brother manohar by
[58:55] sirenza from swaziland
[58:58] i want to thank god for saving my life
[59:00] last week
[59:02] sunday on our on our way from port
[59:05] elizabeth back to swaziland
[59:08] before leaving port elizabeth we went to
[59:11] greet the pastor
[59:12] and say our goodbyes
[59:15] the pastor assured us god will be with
[59:18] us all the way
[59:20] shortly after living put elizabeth i
[59:23] started feeling half conscious
[59:26] as i was driving i started driving in a
[59:28] funny way
[59:30] either extremely high speed or extremely
[59:33] slow
[59:34] until sister footy offered to take over
[59:37] the driving
[59:39] along the way i continued
[59:42] having this strange feeling of being
[59:44] half conscious
[59:46] but i didn't tell anyone in the car
[59:49] until a point
[59:51] where i felt i could not breathe at all
[59:55] i stood up in the car and started
[59:57] throwing up inside the car
[1:00:00] the car stopped
[1:00:02] and very little i remember of what
[1:00:04] happened thereafter
[1:00:07] i was told by my family
[1:00:09] that after they moved me out of the car
[1:00:12] i just stopped breathing and passed out
[1:00:16] they told me that they immediately
[1:00:18] called pratham kise
[1:00:20] and informed him of the situation
[1:00:23] who quickly informed the pastor
[1:00:27] in a telephone call
[1:00:29] pastor called my name three times then
[1:00:32] prayed
[1:00:33] it was after the pastor's prayer
[1:00:37] that i slowly started gaining
[1:00:39] consciousness
[1:00:42] i was shocked to see so many people
[1:00:44] around me
[1:00:45] and that i was lying down outside in the
[1:00:48] bush
[1:00:50] i was told by my family that before the
[1:00:52] pastor's prayer
[1:00:54] they had tried all possible first aid
[1:00:57] techniques
[1:00:58] but they could not fill any parts
[1:01:02] i was then moved back to the car
[1:01:05] and the pastor called again
[1:01:08] and said a thanksgiving prayer
[1:01:10] i was able to hear the pastor during the
[1:01:13] second prayer
[1:01:15] as i was fully conscious by then
[1:01:18] thereafter
[1:01:19] i got completely healed
[1:01:22] and sound
[1:01:24] only feeling exhausted and hungry
[1:01:28] i thank god for pastor godima
[1:01:31] a man that god has given all the
[1:01:34] authority
[1:01:36] including bringing back life to a
[1:01:38] lifeless body
[1:01:40] if i were to look for another pastor
[1:01:44] i will still run to pastor israel
[1:01:48] god bless you all
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] i still keep receiving a number of
[1:02:05] prayer requests
[1:02:06] but i believe that
[1:02:08] the prayer of that descendant has
[1:02:10] answered all
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] isn't god wonderful
[1:02:18] hallelujah
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:22] let me proceed with the announcement
[1:02:27] we have
[1:02:29] a very serious
[1:02:30] water problem
[1:02:33] in this area
[1:02:35] almost every sunday we struggle with
[1:02:38] water
[1:02:39] even now we don't have water in their
[1:02:41] restrooms
[1:02:43] and that is kasana together with some
[1:02:46] other brothers they are working on a
[1:02:47] solution
[1:02:49] and i believe
[1:02:51] in the next few weeks
[1:02:53] we won't be suffering with this
[1:02:55] water problems anymore
[1:02:58] so
[1:02:59] we have two things
[1:03:04] jojo things but
[1:03:06] somehow
[1:03:07] they are not really
[1:03:09] sufficient
[1:03:11] so
[1:03:13] they are working on more
[1:03:14] jojo things to be installed
[1:03:17] so just
[1:03:19] be patient with us
[1:03:21] in the meantime we have hired
[1:03:24] some restrooms outside and just continue
[1:03:27] to use them
[1:03:28] all
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:32] now i'm coming to
[1:03:36] the beautiful part you know the pastor
[1:03:39] loves you all so much
[1:03:42] so
[1:03:43] the pastor
[1:03:44] has recognized that we have quite a
[1:03:47] number of talents
[1:03:49] we have a number of people that we
[1:03:50] baptized
[1:03:53] and
[1:03:54] some of them have
[1:03:57] they got an opportunity to come and
[1:03:58] greet the pastor and also indicated
[1:04:01] their
[1:04:02] talents
[1:04:03] isn't it beautiful
[1:04:05] so we have quite a number of musicians
[1:04:08] sitting here
[1:04:10] some they play instruments
[1:04:12] some they sing solos
[1:04:17] we are blessed
[1:04:20] so
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:22] the pastor wants to nurture that talent
[1:04:25] so if you are a musician
[1:04:29] and we are not aware that you are a
[1:04:31] musician
[1:04:33] remain seated after the service
[1:04:36] hallelujah
[1:04:38] so the pastor has requested prada
[1:04:42] togozizi
[1:04:44] and bradam kundis
[1:04:46] to assess
[1:04:47] all the talents
[1:04:49] and to plan with you so
[1:04:52] that you can grow in your music talent
[1:04:57] you will be able to render items for us
[1:05:01] you can also join the band at the later
[1:05:04] stage
[1:05:05] may the lord richly bless you
[1:05:08] you see the pastor loves you
[1:05:11] can you stand on our feet

[1:45:08] god bless you
[1:45:10] let's bow our hair muscle again
[1:45:15] the great i am
[1:45:18] alpha and omega
[1:45:21] none is like the
[1:45:24] there was nothing
[1:45:27] when
[1:45:28] it was only jehovah
[1:45:33] the prophet says
[1:45:36] even at that time he had no name
[1:45:40] he was a spirit
[1:45:43] a great fountain of spirit
[1:45:46] and all those who are here this morning
[1:45:50] and are predestinated
[1:45:52] they came from that fountain
[1:45:56] thank you lord that you made us who we
[1:45:59] are
[1:46:01] this morning
[1:46:02] we come like david
[1:46:05] fearing nothing
[1:46:07] because you said
[1:46:10] to joshua
[1:46:12] no man shall stand before thee
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:18] joshua knew that
[1:46:20] it is god who is talking
[1:46:23] and if god says no man shall stand
[1:46:27] before you joshua
[1:46:29] god meant no man
[1:46:33] even today
[1:46:35] the lord god
[1:46:37] who said to us fear not
[1:46:40] i have overcome
[1:46:42] the world
[1:46:44] is the same god we believe this morning
[1:46:48] he told me not to fear
[1:46:51] the god
[1:46:52] who said through paul
[1:46:55] in christ
[1:46:57] you are more than conquerors
[1:47:00] if i can believe this god there is
[1:47:02] nothing to believe
[1:47:04] even this morning satan has come with
[1:47:08] his agents
[1:47:10] but who fear them
[1:47:12] for their lord god is on our side
[1:47:16] when joshua met the man with the sword
[1:47:19] he knew that
[1:47:21] he said i am the captain of the host
[1:47:24] and joshua knew the battle is won
[1:47:27] because the christian has arrived
[1:47:30] and this morning we have invited the
[1:47:33] captain
[1:47:34] of the roost
[1:47:36] and no enemy no falcon stand before us
[1:47:40] because this is the blood of christ
[1:47:43] come satan with your people
[1:47:49] you are you are defeated you are a
[1:47:51] defeated foe
[1:47:53] you have no power around us
[1:47:57] and we stand here
[1:47:59] as being more than conquerors
[1:48:02] and that we know him whom we serve
[1:48:06] and we know his power

[1:48:51] we are going to
[1:48:54] look at this
[1:48:58] firstly
[1:49:04] your
[1:49:07] your destiny
[1:49:09] and your destination
[1:50:02] they were not taken by any doctrine of
[1:50:06] the wind
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:35] we
[1:50:49] all right
[1:51:01] i'll start from here
[1:51:18] spirits
[1:51:25] because
[1:51:28] the people that are walking this way
[1:51:30] abandoned
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:47] on the way to
[1:51:48] somewhere embarrassing
[1:51:52] now
[1:51:54] the journey
[1:51:56] humble this journey is like this
[1:51:58] lunch
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:29] now you'll find some people who
[1:52:31] tolerable and
[1:52:33] if somebody
[1:52:35] comes trying
[1:52:38] to follow these people
[1:52:42] uh
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:56] i know of the people who are so
[1:52:59] loving and wonderful people yes
[1:53:04] whom i thought that having gone to spend
[1:53:08] eternity together

[1:53:37] when i was young
[1:53:43] every person
[1:53:45] was together with me
[1:53:48] we were together for
[1:53:51] eternity
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:54:02] actually eternity is the word of god
[1:54:19] to be
[1:54:19] wonderful people
[1:54:25] they have fallen off but we really
[1:54:29] and i wonder
[1:54:31] those people when someone does

[2:04:16] they were holding to
[2:04:18] their
[2:04:20] father's traditions
[2:04:35] the spoken word is the original siege
