Description:
The Third Pull
Description: This message was preached  by Pastor Amen Gama at Smart School in Soshanguve South Africa, invited by Pastor Israel Nkodima on the 22 December 2022. 

The primary purpose of this sermon is to make both our viewers and community aware that Our Lord Jesus Christ spoke about three commissions to the Church, the first and second has gone through, the third which is the New commission that the Lord gave, is now in process, especially to those who live  post the Laodicean Church Age.  During the service the Pastor read Luke 13:24-27“Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.”
The Spirit of the Lord let the Pastor to lay foundation for the title teaching the Church about The Third Pull . The Pastor  also read  Spoken Word - "The First Seal  “And they were separated, like the sheep from the goats. That’s right. There is the church members come up. And if they heard the Truth and rejected the Truth, then what’s going to be said when the big thing is spread across the canvas, when even your own thoughts will be there, what you thought about It? How you going to escape it, and it right there on the canvas of the skies, and God’s great television there. It’s your own thoughts rebelling. Your own thoughts will speak against you in that hour.
He also read additional scriptures Psalms 16:8 and Isaiah 59:19, to teach the church about the Third Pull.

the Angela will tell you the time to live Hallelujah before us they are pastors coming from various places as the prophet says and a sheep cannot find its own way apart from there being a pastor to show the Sheep the way as we are like this we are like ship so God has done a great Wonder uh um he entered into a man and what what he desired all the time for him to be one with men when we see what we see with our eyes it's the evidence that God is now one with men when God is not yet one with men we see a difference when God is not yet one with men we see separations and rejections hallelujah

your voice [Music] today [Music] [Music] okay Mommy lift up your voice it's my love ly yes [Music] foreign where those who are pretenders will not reach that place those who Worship in vain shall not enter therein hallelujah amen it reminds me yes the queen of Shivan yes she heard of the wisdom and amen she would always ask from those that she sees have you been to Israel have you heard about their God but what do they say about him Hallelujah the Living God the God who can speak foreign [Music] [Music] and I would ask a question of those who are up in the mountains back have you been to mess Park where the Living God is hiding he is hidden himself in a man this woman she had a desire eventually she took the journey we were born and local to go and see that which is our Israel what they say about either the god of Israel Nazi even for us we took the journey to go see this God who speaks The God Who listens the God who hides himself in a man now we have arrived says now we can see that it's the truth now this woman the queen says if I can reach Israel kulum and I find that indeed he speaks and he is living I will take out my my precious gifts and give to him I will take out my offerings and offer to him so that I may be a partaker Hallelujah after having seen this God amen um oh when I'm satisfied of The God Who is in that old man Hallelujah I found a Wonder here is a figure when the queen arrived Limited now this is sounds that I asked that they shouldn't go they started playing now once now it has been played when the Ark of the Covenant started moving that which is above the key or solomoni Solomon and that which was in Solomon the King was now clear um when they started playing the hubs and instruments Solomon now the mystery was now made clear Allelujah that's why even soul even Saul wait Mike when he got into trouble he wanted that the happy place David would play the happiness and now something would leave Satan knows the revelation of the children of God when we sing we had to go to college Satan knows that there is a there is that he's not able to come against anymore the prophet says teaching places the church positionally see if we are pastors when we have pastors they teach us about this is our date if placing a position when you don't have a pasta you don't have a you are not positioned if you have not accepted your pastor you have not been positionally placed foreign amen um or if you doubt the pastor you are not positionally placed in physics I want to speak to the people who have been positionally foreign that's why the scripture says I always put a god I always put him before me in the description 16. Psalms chapter six I always say it the Lord before me if we have people who always said the Lord amen before the abundance between those are the people are going to be rapture Psalms chapter 16 verse 8 yes eight yes it says I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved so that I shall not be moved foreign that when the Lord comes we shall not be ashamed hallelujah amen that this is what I required of a man hallelujah amen if you have set the Lord before you know there is nothing that Satan can do to you Mondays there are many times that say traps that Satan tries but if he finds you having set the lord always before you again there is nothing that he can do to you we read a scripture that says hey that's Isaiah 59 verse 19 Isaiah 59 verse 19. yes the Bible says Isaiah 59 verse 19. so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up his standard against you amen hallelujah amen is there an enemy here is the enemy here um's Corner if there is the enemy we are waiting for the spirit of the Lord when you say easy so that the spirit of the Lord May lift up the standard amen that's why that's why when we find those that are sick we must remind them of this scripture amen God bless praise God Amen that God raises the standard when God has raised the standard um the child of God is not shaking Hallelujah um [Music] there's a standard that has not been raised just like a fire that is um the enemy is able to raise the standard also from their side but the third pool always represent Christ um we pass from the teachings of it and when we come to the reality the Deadpool is the men in the pasta that man is Christ himself outlining the message the stages of the journey the first stage second stage and the third always the pet is representing Christ the first pool second pool third pools what is the third pool what is the unfolding of the Mysteries what is the mystery that mystery is Christ in a man come in um when God is in a man that is [Music] time God spoke in many ways [Music] with his own son that is the power of transformation that brings the rapturing faith [Music] in a man when he is in a man about the children of God come into manifest first stage the first stage of the journey that was Egypt the first pool the second stage of the journey so humble yes wilderness that's the second pool at that stage that is the promised land oh he is be a beggar the bride now um positionally Indonesia okay the prophet of God says that is what we were praying for seeing amen from Malawi being a pasta it means the Deadpool has met with the men otherwise he will remain being a malawian um seeing a man from Zambia Zambia morning if not so you remain being a Zambian um seeing a man from is coming from Swaziland it means that something wonderful has happened when the two omnipotent Meats um I mean we need the two omnipotentina as the pasta has been outlining this in those days they were having two texts then these two texts Hallelujah another party anyways that is fellowshipping yeah when when saving the Lord um is whereby the third as to execute something pasta preaching the word of God is not being tossed it means that the Deadpool I spotted that man is I mean when he started playing their hops um greater than Solomon start to unfold the Queen of Sheba then realized that there is someone now who is greater in configures the one with discernment um the one who can design the hearts the heart of the preachers are you saving him in a right way or not um [Music] the one with that great discernment the one who can judge the way we Fellowship is hallelujah amen me too this morning I can testify also that the greater than Solomon is here I've seen him I've seen with my Naked Eyes hola I wouldn't even come here if I couldn't realize that there is someone who is greater than the pastor um he who is greater than Solomon um he gave me that assurance I have I am with that man [Applause] even though people they take him as a Layman or just a person I have seen hidden himself in that man so that is [Music] he who is greater than the pastor must stand up but in the third part that third part brings along healing not that party is hallelujah amen there are some here who can testify much better um God open their way for us there you won't believe that um the pastor sent me that I should officiate a marriage for a certain couple uh they're in the mountains and fundies the God is in you if I was the one who was going to say this to me um the way other people who witnessed what I witnessed as well um would you like to hear such a testimony do you love God

north um looking inside of the pyramid um when the pastor was given the commission Leo commission to take the children of God pyramid to make them to look inside of the pyramid pyramid those that were patient enough to look inside of the pyramid so that he comes back with a new Commission barclaysia they were advised or they were or they were crowd Ed pyramid just because of looking inside of the pyramids something is something descended into their hearts what do you call a white stone as it means a nature foreign that person will not be a politician Grace he won't be a scoffer he won't be a hypocrite is that what stone when it left the pyramid it went straight to the soul the prophet gave them the commission say look into the pyramid when you watch the pyramid that Stone comes out they drank from the well or from The Rock foreign foreign when it finds a hypocrite it just goes to the side abandoning is a lot of people that we worship with they don't have that white stone they can read spoken words it's not in them when if that rock was in them they would follow London and the teaching of the past thank you be careful no big screen all that we do there is a big screen in front

first book it's represented by quotes [Music] the second book is represented by sheep Emmanuel the third book is the lamb spoke of life whereby the prophets were privileged Prophet The Prophet himself to preach to the predestinated must reach the third not just ordinary believers three forms of Believers you heard about them but you have to consider the third because foreign Hallelujah the third could heal you without being being laid hence if you read adoption is tired God there speaks about the faith the power of transformation foreign that that is revealing Estates because once you once you hybrid it dies like the life of a dove could not be mixed up [Music] it doesn't have the cows inside of it oh yeah if you give it the food that will need a Dal that Dove would die when we preach
