Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust you are all happy. &gt;&gt; Time is just our enemy. Actually, it is a time for the preacher now. So, we are on a grace period. May the Lord richly bless you. As we say, touching Jesus is all that really matters. &gt;&gt; Touching Jesus is all that matters. &gt;&gt; We'll be displaying the prayer request. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Jesus [Music] in your life. And your life will never be the same. &gt;&gt; There is only [Music] there is only [Music] one way to touch him. Just indeed. &gt;&gt; Just believe when you call on his name. Oh, touching Jesus is all better in your life. [Music] and your life will never be the same. &gt;&gt; There is only there is only one way to touch. &gt;&gt; Just believe. Just believe when you call on his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can just commit this prayer request unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And also the offerings and the tidings. We are running short of ways to say thank you unto the Lord for the goodness that you are doing into our lives. Lord, when Jesus died on that cross, there was blood that scattered the gap. And that blood, it was the power where the Bible says we were healed through that blood from the foundation of the world. The same power it is the power gracious heavenly father that is in your bride this morning. There are so many requests that has been brought gracious Lord. But there is a healing power and that power gracious Lord will touch each and everyone. [Music] And also for those Lord who never manage to bring their request but you know their hearts the very same healing power is touching each and everyone. Gracious Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that Lord through the grace and through the power of the Lord, that is why we've got the thanksgiving. Because Lord, after healing your people, they will come and say thank you unto the almighty God because the God has done it for them. Even also this morning, Father, we pray that let no even a single one, gracious heavenly father, who definitely need your healing, need your power in the corner where you are, gracious heavenly father, let it work for them in the name of Jesus. Casting out every demonic power, casting out devils in the name of Jesus. You Satan, get out and never come back in the name of Jesus because the healing power of the Lord is controlling right now. Thank you heavenly father that they shall testify and say that the god the god the the god has made it for them again this morning. We give you the glory and we give you the honor for we are worthy to be praised not for coaching baba amat tithes and offering that has come through. We pray for them Lord and bless each and everyone in the name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; The band will just say something. While we display our thanksgivings, [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe uh we have visitors this morning. All our visitors feel at home. We also have brother Timber from Bley North. North. If our brother can stand. Amen. God bless you. You are welcome. Feel at home. [Music] If we have any other visitor, [Music] can they stand? We also just want to welcome them [Music] and may the Lord richly bless them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; We also have our sister here, &gt;&gt; Sister Gracius Asani. &gt;&gt; Sister Gracious Asani &gt;&gt; who also wants to be baptized. May the Lord richly bless you for taking such a bold step. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have uh greetings also &gt;&gt; from the saints. [Music] We have a minister from Uganda, &gt;&gt; Reverend Kennedy Nawasali. Reverend Kennedyali and say shalom. Please pass my Christian greetings to the pastor and the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shalom. We also have our elder Gabrielson and he says God bless his children in Mame Loi today from Florida. &gt;&gt; Can we all say God bless you Elder Reed? &gt;&gt; God bless you Elder Reed. &gt;&gt; And God bless Reverend Kennedy. And God bless Reverend Kennedy. &gt;&gt; Not forgetting our elder Larims. &gt;&gt; God bless our Elder Lar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are the upcoming events. &gt;&gt; The next Saturday we have a wedding in Malawi. And on the 11th of August we have another wedding. [Music] October. Oh, &gt;&gt; in smart school, &gt;&gt; we also shared a a link for for people to register. I trust you have all made the RSVP. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We also have our elderly &gt;&gt; from Northwest. &gt;&gt; I'm sure many of you remember and is back in fellowship with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we have decided to display the photo because he's not feeling well. So at the moment he's in and out of the hospital also. So he wanted to be with us so that we can introduce him while he's present with us. So we asked him to send us the photo so that we can display to the church. May the Lord richly bless you. We also have a request that when we send prayer request and thanksgivings, if we can try to make them a little bit shorter so that we can save time, we also have a request for those that are rendering musical items. that they practice with the band. They can always li us with brother Kandis and he will assist them to practice with the band and also let us try to keep our items shorter so that we don't take the time for the preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there is another request. [Music] We may have created a wrong impression. And please forgive us. It was not our intention. I'm sure you remember when Pastor Magu was preaching indicated that he received a call from sister Das. So that was actually a request from the pastor that the sister called pastor to come and see him and to come and preach. So it was the pastor that actually requested pastor Magua to come and preach. So every time you see a minister standing on the pullpit It is always a request from the pastor. Sometimes when we are close, when we are close to the pastor, the pastor will ask us, can you call so and so to come and preach? Sometimes sometimes he will ask a can you call so to come and preach. And sometimes the pastor himself will pick up a phone and call. So it is the pastor that actually recommend a preacher for us. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we created the wrong impression, please forgive us. We are blessed in this church. We have our precious pastor, Pastor Israel. And he is our shepherd. Can we thank God for that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even this morning we are truly blessed. Our precious pastor has requested our elder. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you as we stand on our feet to welcome the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. with our special song. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the [Music] be to make that [Music] our should be finished. as he has declared to reset [Music] you before and he shall [Music] to their children. The heart of their children [Music] will come. Holy [Applause] [Music] Ghost [Music] with power. [Music] Holy God, &gt;&gt; we [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I greet you this morning in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm standing in the gap &gt;&gt; because our pastor has requested me to stand on his behalf. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe I must apologize. You can sit for 5 seconds. [Music] &gt;&gt; It just came to my heart that I must share this with you. The reason being &gt;&gt; maybe many are wondering what is happening with our pastor because it's been sometimes not behind the pullpit. I I I want to read you a quote &gt;&gt; from brother Brennham life story life story &gt;&gt; because some of the things do happen in life and we do not understand we realize that things are in the hand of God. Uh I said it the other day go and read the spoken word called life story [Music] life story &gt;&gt; of brother Brenham the people of the old I know they've read it but read it again for understanding this time amen what we are going through in life brother went through &gt;&gt; brotherham and he became our example. That's why it came to me that I must just read this this quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says &gt;&gt; I stayed so long in the platform and things until I had to take 8 months rest. I don't know how many of you knew that brother Brennham &gt;&gt; did not preach for 8 months. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was off the field when they thought I would leave the world. You've heard the story of that. And while I was gone, why some of the other ministers that were following along be behind my ministry was going ahead. praying for the sick &gt;&gt; and they were carrying articles and so forth. So the suggestion was made suggest &gt;&gt; that we make it the inter evangelical paper &gt;&gt; and just not have any representing anyone a certain man and that's the way I like to see things. I don't want things that look as to myself. I want it for the church of the living God, for everybody. Did you hear it? You know, Jacob dug three wells. The one well, they drove him away and he called it strife. &gt;&gt; And the other one was a malice, &gt;&gt; I believe, or hatred. or something. He he said well and said there's a room for us all. &gt;&gt; So I think that's what what is what now? There's a room for us all. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Many a times when the anointing strike me Just imagine going out into another world then coming back &gt;&gt; then out then. &gt;&gt; That was brother and after a while you get weak. After a while you don't know where you are. And when I go to walk, it's not because I'm too weak but I can't see where I'm walking. Then believe sometimes put arms around me, he he watches. If you will notice, he will stand over there in a corner somewhere and keep his eye on it. That's the reason I have him. [Music] &gt;&gt; How many remembers when I was off for eight months because of poor management and so forth. Amen. Then brother Brenham continued saying the scripture teaches us that as well. He said, "Look at Elijah." After being under the vision up there and saw how to fix that bullock and everything, &gt;&gt; a bulock &gt;&gt; for the sacrifice, called fire down out of heaven and rain out of heaven. The same day went out in the wilderness. was lost for 40 days and nights wandering around. God found him, pulled him back in the cave. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He heard the winds goes by and he heard noise goes by and then a small still voice said, "What are you look in there, Elijah? See the anointing left him and that's it. Last quote. Brother was in the service when he comes back after 8 months. He said &gt;&gt; am I looking at Henry Croenry? &gt;&gt; God bless you brother Henry. I haven't seen you for a long time and brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just happened to look back seen dead and recognize him. Seen dead recognize him. The other day was not even recognizing his death. When I had my great breakdown, break down or come off the field about eight months. They were real brother and a daddy to me. They stayed right with me all the time. I never will forget the day that brother grow there we went out in the cornfield to pray. I was so nervous. I stayed in the vision so long I couldn't tell whether I was in or out. He put his arm around me. Just simple like said now papa god will you come and help brother papa god will you come help brother brenham brother that always stayed with me brother &gt;&gt; oh what a day it will be brother Someday I hope to have my arms around you and set down by the evergreen trees where the fountains of waters of life is flowing from the throne. We will be in the presence of our papa God then forever and ever to live in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you that all men of God has went through this. If you don't see our pastor this morning, don't worry. Just be like brother Cro put your arm around him and say Papa God make everything well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I many of you did not know what brother went through but lucky we are this morning we know what he went through when he was not behind the pull pit he was talking with God brother after he came back to the pull pit the devil couldn't challenge him I just want to tell you This morning pastor is not behind the prophet today physically. He is coming. When he comes the devil will not challenge. I had an opportunity of being with him for three weeks. I saw him every day. It's the third week. It was the third week yesterday. I've seen that and I have a personal testimony that I want to share with you. The reason why I was with the pastor for 3 weeks is because I'm not working. This is the third month not working. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I went to see I explained to the board what happened. Then I said to the pastor, I'm not working. I'll be with you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he asked me what happened. I explained to him that we work in project and the project has duration. Now the duration has an ending. It came to an end. But they promise me that they will call me if there's another project. And I I stick to that. Every day. I'm saying every day. There was never a single day pastor did not ask me that question. Did they call you? I'll say no pastor. He closed their eyes. He said they will call you. I don't know he was tired or he was praying for me. [Applause] But he did that &gt;&gt; for two weeks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the third week, that was this week on Tuesday because even that Monday he asked me then in Tuesday on Tuesday he didn't ask me then my company you know we have a website where we see whether they are project or not. website. Then I look on the website, I find that there's a project in Second Skunda is not far from Wheatbank, &gt;&gt; but it's about 110 kilometers. To me, it's not far. &gt;&gt; Then I phoned the head office. It was early in the morning around. I said I see a project in Sund why can't you take me there then they said to me no we are not taking you there we found someone I I was not happy to be honest I said this guy come Tuesday the very same Tuesday midday I I received a call from the head office they greeted me was the senior director Then I say I'm fine. They say agently send your document. We have a project for you. Amen. Amen. And I said to the pastor I need a project that is not far from home. Can be here in Oh yes. That's why I was very much worried about second. Then the pastor said, "No, you'll get the one that is for you nearer to your house. Don't worry." Then I asked this director of mine, "Where do you want to place me?" He said, "With bank." Amen. Then I asked him, "Am I dreaming or what?" So I was like, "I don't know how God does things." There's a power station called station. just 35 km from my house. So, I'll be working there. God bless you. I'm just strengthening you because God is a good God. Keep on holding on his everlasting arms as we stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song, our national anthem. and we will read the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now [Music] Christ [Applause] when mercy oh mercy mercy I am &gt;&gt; I am I am [Music] Oh, [Music] Christy. Oh, mercy. Oh, mercy. Oh, mercy. Come on. Oh my god. I am Oh, [Music] God. Holy Ghost.

Father, &gt;&gt; he's about to deliver a message, Lord. Gracious Lord. &gt;&gt; That comes from thee. &gt;&gt; Father, may we not see him. May we hear his voice &gt;&gt; and behind that voice may it be thee Lord Almighty &gt;&gt; and may we receive from you Lord &gt;&gt; so that at the end of this service &gt;&gt; we should say the Lord spoke unto us &gt;&gt; extend your hand Lord Almighty &gt;&gt; and stand behind him Lord &gt;&gt; and shield him Lord &gt;&gt; and anoint him Lord &gt;&gt; and inspire I am gracious Lord &gt;&gt; that you should faithful faithfully deliver that message for them. &gt;&gt; We are here Lord Almighty as your children &gt;&gt; to hear from thee Lord &gt;&gt; being the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Give us also that faith Lord Almighty &gt;&gt; and open up our spiritual ears Lord &gt;&gt; that we should have the spiritual understanding Lord &gt;&gt; and receive out of thee Lord.

Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have sung this song. But incomplete. &gt;&gt; We forgot to we forgot to say &gt;&gt; we have the seven seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing [Music] now. Oh, [Music] heat, heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat up here. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we open our Bible in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 only verse 21. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the book of Revelation 20 verse 1-3. And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, and he that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled, and after that he must be loosed a little season. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Thank you for being patient. Let's start with our message of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We continue with our same title, the simultaneous appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. Today we specifically look at the millennium. Millennium is a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I we I was talking to brother harvest just behind here that I said we are in part four. He said part three. I I said this millennium. Previously we were speaking about the and then the go and make and then our bright age. Bright age. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So we agreed on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a moment that we call the millennium. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham. Brother was ask questions by people thinking that the millennium is eternity. Then brother said no millennium is not eternity eternity is in the new Jerusalem. Millennium is time. Yes. Amen. Then he spoke about the post millennium, the preliminary or the prelim millennium &gt;&gt; and the no millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he was trying to show the people that what happened before millennia, what is happening in the millennium, what will be happening after the millennium. For today we will talk about the millennium. Why the simultaneous you know? Well, in back then we were normally talking about the Israelites, the Samaritans and the Gentile. And the time goes by. So today we will talk about the bride, the foolish visions, &gt;&gt; the unbelievers and Israel. What will be happening for this people in the millennium only the millennium? Where will the bride be? Where will the foolish vision be? Where will the unbeliever be? Where will the Israelites be? Are we together? Amen. Now brother start teaching us about what happened in the garden of Eden that God has created this earth for six days for 6,000 days and then the seventh day he rest. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said the seventh day was like a millennia. But none has completed thousand year in his life since human race began. No one has lived a thousand years. Adam lived 930 years. 98. &gt;&gt; You will find it in Genesis 5. Genesis 5th lived 969 years. &gt;&gt; You will find the same chapter verse 27 27. They couldn't reach a thousand years. And God has made a man to live a thousand years. Now a man fail. If a man fails, God cannot fail. He will fight back to restore a man to live a thousand years. That is God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says the first Adam was the living soul. But the second aid being Jesus Christ is the quickening spirit. Now the first Eve was the one that fell. But the bride being the second Eve is infallible. I'm talking to the infallible one. [Music] You are the one that you will never fall. You are the one that will benefit from where Eve fell from where Adam fell. He will live that thousand years. &gt;&gt; Well, brother was saying Jesus &gt;&gt; for him to be in this earth He wanted to bring back that man has lost because if he doesn't bring back Satan Satan &gt;&gt; is the winner. Now Satan cannot be the winner from Revelation 12. He tried in heaven. He couldn't win. He will try here. He will not win. He will try later. to win. &gt;&gt; I read just the elect goes in that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The time of millennia on then brother. What type of people should we be? I want to live through the millennium. Let us lay aside every weight and sin that so easily beset us. If the fellow says something wrong or does something this way, pray for him and keep moving on, let your one alternative be set towards God. If nobody else makes it, you make it. For there's going to be an elect who's going to live through the millennium period and will go in and out with Christ for a thousand years and then shall go up into glory with him and return again. When the resurrection of the wicked is brought forth, then the millennium set in the end of the thousand years. He will return with the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ comes three times. &gt;&gt; First, &gt;&gt; he came to redeem. He &gt;&gt; is redeeming us. He's redeeming his church for only that three purposes. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Secondly, he come to receive his church. Thirdly, he come with his church. He He He only came for that. He come to redeem her. He comes to rapture. Caught be caught away. in the time of the plagues and so forth. Return back for the millennium. Live the millennium. Amen. Amen. When Christ died on the cross, he was redeeming us. For we were born in this world, the world of sin, shaped in iniquity. He must cleanse us. He must redeem us. When we are redeemed, we are his church. We are his bride and he rapture us. When he rapture us, he take us to the millennium. Amen. Amen. That's where we will enjoy with him. Like a brother, when you get married, you want to please your wife. on a millennium and you start preparing that journey. Let's say you are not flying. You are driving to wherever you'll be driving. But along the way, you have some stop, have some snacks, refreshment, you're still driving, you are still in a journey. And then when you reach your destination, that's where You relax. Now you start to tell your wife what is her future future. Why you chose amongst all women? You start telling her those things. How long is the honeymoon? During our time, &gt;&gt; it was not compulsory to go for but now we got married in your list will check why there's no honeymoon. It's it's kind of compulsor Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now that's where you start to I don't know whether you're going to take two weeks or a month but whatever time you taking our Lord Jesus Christ take us to the millennium thousand years. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How much he loved us. We are part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When all those wars come When we are the bright in the bright ages brother and sister when we are enjoying ourselves we are just in a time we are just going somewhere when we get into the rapture rapture is a time three and a half years do not end there but we are still continuing and we go to the &gt;&gt; millennia &gt;&gt; millennia where our Lord Jesus Christ will be able to tell us all for a thousand years. A years that no one has ever lived in this world. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be there with you and there is a time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that time we will be enjoying ourselves. If you miss rapture don't expect yourself in the millennium a rapture or as we are today we are in a journey we go to the rapture still is in a journey maybe when you are going to Cape Town we are in blue fondane but when we are in rapture we are already about to enter because the rapture is just ushering us to the millennium then you reach your destination is not ending there. We are going somewhere. Today we talk only about this. God give us time will continue. So now we have Israel, a nation that is well respected amongst all the nations, can be hated by many but is the nation that God loves. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be hated by men, &gt;&gt; but you are the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that he loved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the millennium of thousand years belongs to us as the bride of Jesus Christ. Where will Israel be? What is happening with them? What is happen with the vision? in the fool and the unbelievers. You will see as we go. Brother said, "Ira had their millennia here in this earth." Do you understand? We will be having our listening to this man from Joshua yesterday. I was listening to I could see &gt;&gt; he needs help. You know, he's talking about how the European took our resources. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he does not know. Remember that man I'm talking about in his heyday. You couldn't stand before him. He was the most powerful preacher. He was a bishop bishop. But today since have turned like this you know why he looked up to here up to the resources of this world but we look beyond the resources of this world. When you look beyond the resources of this world, you see a thousand years in the millennium that God is given to us. You can take the resources. You can take the man of this world. I don't care. What I will care the most is when I see myself in the millennium that God has prepared for me. I said it last time that God is a good God. when they take the the minerals, God is preparing us to the millennium. That is why God, he finished the course of life through Africa. I want that thing in you. people, you are lesser than anybody else because God has given you what the world does not have. When we go this message, we go back to Israel. Listen to what brother Brennham says. He set Israel ahead millennia. I read God gave Solomon a gift and all the whole church. Everybody believed in it. That was a millennium for the Jewish. That was the Old Testament millennium &gt;&gt; in the days of Solomon. Yes. &gt;&gt; A for millennium to come. And I said, &gt;&gt; "The richest people in the world are Jewish people. They scattered the entire world. They own everything on the natural side and is what God has given today. lucky we are this morning because God has gave us everything that belongs to heaven. &gt;&gt; So we have two people here. We have the natural people that God has blessed the spiritual people that God has blessed and us thousand years for the Israelites 40 years. Amen. &gt;&gt; The golden age of the Jewish notice, nobody started war with them. They feared them because they knew their God was because they had him in their presence. The people was all in one heart, one accord. Why? Amen. &gt;&gt; The fame went everywhere. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. And you hear, "Oh, what a great thing. Great God. Israel has a living God. Everybody has realized that Israel has a real God, has a living God. The entire nation they knew Israel. That was the millennium. David was a fighter. &gt;&gt; He was fighting the Philistine. He was fighting the pes. He was fighting the amalachi. He was fighting preparing the throne son. When his son get into the throne status changed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the state has changed, Israel is in their millennia. At the age of 15, Solomon, he became the king and he ruled for 40 years. He died at the age of 55. During that time of 40 years there was no war in everything that they do they were in one heart one accord everything they touch blossom because is the millennium and there was never a time in Israel like the time of Solomon where the whole nation was at peace. Even if other nation wanted to invade them, they are not scared of Israel, they were scared of their living. They were scared of their living God because they realized that if God punish you, he will punish you to the fullest. You will never stand the wrath of God. Don't take chance with God. Be a humble brother. Be a humble sister. Then God will bless you. Don't try to make yourself something that is not in the word of God. You are trying to fool God. You will never stand his wrath. other nation that tried to invade Israel, they were just shaking because when they see Israel fighting, they started to realize it's not them, it's something else. Amen. Amen. Amen. When God said to Joshua, "Go to Jero, surround their walls." At the last day, the seventh day, the walls of Jericho fell. Was it the sword of Joshua? &gt;&gt; Come on. Be realistic. It was not. It was God. When they start to think about it, they started to see none can challenge Israel. Now brother says the journey they had Israelites naturally is the journey we are having spiritually brothers and sisters none can challenge you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to take it further. Whoever can challenge you is challenging God. Can you challenge God and win? &gt;&gt; Let's not challenge one another. [Applause] Let's be in one heart. Be in one accord. We are in the foraste of the millennium. We are about to go there. Just a matter of time. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the other people, they just want to try to prove who they are to know they are challenging God. [Music] We we think of this Solomon &gt;&gt; in that great millennium of the Jews that when no nation dare to touch them and the great gift of God was in the prophet till he made it known to the queen of all her secrets in her heart. Nothing was withheld but a great age showing and typing that there was a great age coming to us. Don't worry about Maponga and them. Don't worry about the resources of this country of this country. Don't worry about the millennium. That's where we are going. The Bible says you know the only thing that must concern you is when you are named is written in the lamp. [Music] I don't know you listen to the news or what has dust blowing all over &gt;&gt; he's not taking chances &gt;&gt; those untouchables in the South African government shaking but let Let me tell you why is the very same people that has the minerals that owns mines that owns billions and wealth of the country but where are they now brother don't run after those are temporal the word of God teaches us there anything that you can see with the naked eye is temporal And the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. [Applause] That is why people like myself when I need God, I just go close to the pastor. Then I'll come back with job to to feed my family. But for me to have billions in the account, I might come back belittling all of you. [Applause] I'm sorry, &gt;&gt; but just take them in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can we continue? Notice &gt;&gt; this is still not he said the this millennium reign the thousand years it's not the new earth it will happen here on earth brothers and sisters do you realize how much Lord Jesus Christ has honored us he honored us. He He take us on his journey of life. He give you this message. He revealed all the sins for you. He manifested all you to the rapture after the rapture. He take you to the millennia. It's not your effort. It's not because you can read the scripture. It's not because you come to church every Sunday. It's not because you know better that for you unconditional love [Music] the young brothers when you want to get married if you are still looking for a sister one that can cook better one that is beautiful on the face one that is educated, one that is this and that. You are lost. You're looking for something else that you cannot eat. &gt;&gt; The one that cook, he can cook less today, tomorrow, put more salt. I don't know. You're going to divorce. Don't put a measure of a standard That is so low. When you choose a wife, you choose the one that is in you. [Applause] And if you choose the one that is in you, if you love her unconditionally, [Applause] if she sweat as you, Amen. You say, "I like that, honey." Don't worry, you're going to the millennia. I'm trying to say in your situation condition God loved you conditionally unconditionally I want you when when you say unconditional is when you have money you don't have money you are sick you are wealthy you are educate ated. You are angry. You are happy. When I look at you, I just love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That is an unconditional love, does not have condition. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you're stilling looking for the one that cooks nice, good luck. Let's continue. That's what we go into the millennium. We go into the millennium. But that isn't the new earth, &gt;&gt; the new heaven. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. That just a rest place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was driving from Witbank &gt;&gt; to the pastor's house. Just after the toll gate, &gt;&gt; my car says rest. You need coffee. &gt;&gt; Not even 200 kilometers, I must rest and drink coffee. No, but God gave us the rest place of a thousand years. Our God is a good God. But the rest place in this world after 200 kilometers you rest when you are driving a long distance you can see naturally we we we rest we get tired and so forth but the rest of a thousand years something else if someone can look at that and look up to that and hold on that is the reality When I was with the pastor, he says something like, "You know what? When we go forward, &gt;&gt; let's do everything that will please God." I said, "Amen. Amen. do everything that will please God and say amen to that because we are going to a millennium and in a millennium it's not the end of things and have coffee after coffee we continue we are going somewhere later &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; amen not all the heavens and earth. For you see in the millennium we have things that will not go into that is a type of the old seventh day. The seventh day after he made the world, the seventh day he rested in there in Eden and the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is eternal. He's taking us to eternity before we hit there. He just give us the you know you rest and continue. You rest and continue. Not because you are tired. You are not tired. He He just enjoying himself with us. I want you children of God to take the word of God easy. Take it easy. Relax because a complete job was done. A complete job was done. Why are you worried? about the things of this world. Relax, brother. &gt;&gt; God did everything for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know those that had experience traveling with their, you know, families when as a as a husband driving a long distance, your wife on the left side, sleeping, your kids behind, you driving, you maneuver, you do everything, you stop somewhere and say, "Guys, let's have coffee." And then we continue. Then oh where is this place? Then we just say no it's just a garage. I'm just trying to simplify things. They don't even know where they are. They don't know how many car missed you on the road. You are just fighting for them. You were in charge of the car. You were in control. But your wife and the kids are relaxing believing that our father will make us reach the destiny. [Applause] So why as a child of God sitting at the rear seat telling God Papa God will just look at them and say, "Hey, relax." &gt;&gt; Don't help God. &gt;&gt; That one that says God helps those that there is no apostles in here. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; relax in the word of God. A complete job was done. We're just crucifying going from level to another level. For you to be in the message, it's not because you seen better, you understood better. Why the next person didn't see what you see? It shows it's not you. It was God doing it for you. So if God has done it for you, why are you worried? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Are we still happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Future home. &gt;&gt; Future home. We are going to the official home. But before we get there, let's see the millennium. And notice not the perfect world. This millennium of the seventh day. Then comes the white throne judgment. See, we still have judgment. We still in time in the millennium. It's a day. A thousand years. It's a time element. Don't get mixed up with the new earth because it's not &gt;&gt; is time. &gt;&gt; Armageddon. &gt;&gt; Armageddon &gt;&gt; is time. Rapture is time. Millennium is time. You understand? White throne judgment. Go and make time. New city is no time. So we are going to a place of no time. But along the way we have those rest joy go are we together as I was just giving this example when you travel with your family I don't know about you but now when I travel with my family my wife my kids are sleeping but here we are we reach all the destinated Because they have a trust that daddy will make us rich. You are daddy. God will make you. You don't need to help him. He knew Satan. He defeated Satan. He will defeat Satan. He's going to defeat Satan. If God did that or is doing there just be with him just follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We continue on the future home spoken with spoken future home. &gt;&gt; Notice seven days only has to do with the old creation. The world time seven days that's the millennium the the the rest day as God labor six days labor six days the rest the seventh still in time amenment and speaking of eternal but you There's no such a thing as eighth day. Go back to the first day. The first day, the Sabbath speaks of the old law which must pass away or have to change to another. It didn't pass away. just changed from the old law keeping a certain day of the week and that Sabbath was for the Jewish. Now we are in them which Sabbath we are resting but the rest day that we need that will not see death is the millennia. We labored for six days. When we labor for six days and the churches is come, the seventh one is the end of everything. No wonder brother Brandham says we are no longer in church. As the seventh church age, we are in the bright age. The bright age is the foretaste of eternity. If we are in the bright age started crucified anytime rapture can take place and I repeat don't say hey the message today was wonderful I'm going to start working for God. You're wasting your time. Don't even there because you will be deceiving yourself. You are not going to start living right doing the right thing after this sermon if you are blessed this morning. But the living right will be with God has started in eternity. It will go to eternity. It's a life of God in a human being. That is why the blood at the cross was meant for you and me. Others is foolish. You and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we still together? [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; help us Lord. If there's one, he let us go to his wedding supper of the lamb. Yes. This thousand years of millennium, right? And to then enter into the city after the honeymoon is over. The millennium is merely the honeymoon. Then she the bride take his bridegroom take his bride home it's hers bridegroom his bride or he's gone to prepare the house he's become engaged as I said amen there at the honeymoon there in your millennium where that's where the bride and the groom Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I will build a house for you in Midland &gt;&gt; or in Centurion. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; And then the wife started to say, "Oh, wow. Things will work out here." You understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. And then yeah, I'll make sure you don't suffer financially when the kids come in the house. Everything will be fine. That's the promise. &gt;&gt; How many achieved? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you an honest truth. We promise all those. &gt;&gt; It's like studying a business. You you you sleep, not sleep, but you just close your eyes. You see yourself flying to Dubai. &gt;&gt; All the people when they see you, they salute you. You just give them money. is when you are just relaxing. But when you face really you don't even have a bicycle when you come from a honeymoon you are sleeping &gt;&gt; sometimes you sleeping &gt;&gt; and then the wife will say now realize things are tough you start to work and that's why others end up committing fraud to get money Don't do that as a child of God. You relax, God will do things for you. If you you need something, it will never make you to disrespect God for you. Some of the things God does not give to us because he knows if I can give this one. Billion 1.8 [Applause] [Music] Even car I don't want to give it to him. &gt;&gt; I will give him TT Toyota T &gt;&gt; then you continue with it &gt;&gt; and he will just we are saying heaven we go &gt;&gt; and God will love you in that way. No, I hope you're not driving. &gt;&gt; I was just giving an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Now remember, he comes in three names. The son of man, a prophet, the son of God, the spirit, the son of David for the millennia. That is our God. He He was the son of man, the son of God. He will be the son of David. Who's the son of David? Solomon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Solomon the son of David is the one that God made him to create millennium in Israel. But in fact the son of David is the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ will be the one that will bring millennia for his bride. And here we are this morning. We are the beneficiary of &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Few minutes uh question and answers. The people ask brother a question. They said now &gt;&gt; if if time sees let me put it in this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seals were open then the millennium is also finished is a question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Answer and say no no time didn't seize when seals were open misunderstood it. What happened? The mystery was revealed. No time sees. Watch real close now. Okay. He was playing the tape for them. Time never cease until be a postmillennialist or something that as the question. We got a thousand years. After church has gone home, come back to the earth. Then time cease. in the new heavens and the new earth. Now, millennium is not the new heaven and the new earth will still be seen after the millennium. A millennium is a type of Noah going and carried over and brought him and them on the other side and the sin and the sin ever come out of the ark. What is saying here in the ark there were people that were safe when they come out sin was still there in the millennium we will be there after the millennium sin will be there maybe you don't know what he's talking about is the message that I'm preparing to preach thereafter I want to show you just a tip of it says After the millennium, the devil will come to fight you with Christ and that will be the end of sin. Revelation 12 says there was a war in heaven. In that war in heaven, Lucifer and his angel fought Michael and his angel, but he couldn't conquer them. After the millennium, Lucifer and his angel, Michael and his angel with fire and Michael will consume them with fire. That will be the end of Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Enoch, the translated one, &gt;&gt; was the type of the bride that went up, not the one that was carried over. The sin will still be on the other side of the millennium. During the millennium is peace, but sin will dealt with on will dealt with after the millennium when that time fades out. Now the opening of the seals was that was given by the Holy Spirit. The seventh seal only was to make known what had been left off in the dispensation behind us. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So the seven seals were was dealing with that. But in the millennium we will be at peace. Now as some great theologian tried to corner me on that. He said, "Uh, you God someday will give you the secret of those seven seals. Those seven seals will something that will never land yet. That will be something that's even not in the Bible. No, no, it won't be that because if you do, that will make it me a false prophet. Everything that's there, the whole revelation of Jesus Christ is all completed in this weight. And if the seven seals pertained to the seven church ages, it had to be already passed because we are in Laia church and the seven seals was only revealing what they have left back there and it opened up and they have left what Luda left Wesley left all the reformers and the Pentecostal and down to the present time. The next thing left is the translation of the church. The return of Moses and Elijah, the reign, the millennium reign upon the earth with the bride and the groom for a thousand years. Then the judgment part and then the total annulation of sea will never be no more at that time. Now the seals never ended time or season until after the millennium. No, it still be time until after the millennium. Is it clear to the children of God? &gt;&gt; What is happen? The seven seals came to reveal what was left behind. That is why brother Brandham says we are from the church ages. The first one until to the last one. But the seven seal is when you bring God from heaven down here and cap &gt;&gt; the pyramid. Pyramid &gt;&gt; is the capping of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When I was with the pastor was saying when I come I will tell the children of God about the rapture light. Tell the children of God about the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Who is the pyramid? &gt;&gt; Wait for that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I didn't know my code were this many. Let me skip. &gt;&gt; Let me skip others and go straight to the end and close. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the best thing you can do to a human being is tired. Don't say and I'll make sure the moment you think I'll go forward, I'll stop. But now he is through the church age. Now he has been the son of God. in the millennium he'll be the son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time found out by the scriptures he is to reveal himself again as the son of God prophet &gt;&gt; can I tell you this you are the prophetic class tells you this this time is he revealing himself We know him better. There's no other people that can talk about him except ourselves. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are facing Eden again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to read the last quote. Amen. Amen. Then I close. He said his physical being physical being was raised up to the throne of God where the spirit was on the throne. Now Christ is on the throne a little while and well sees me no more yet you shall see. He's referring this time. The world will not see him, but we shall see for I'll be with you to the end of the world even in you. This is the only time is the only moment when God is in a human being. I repeat myself since the world began from Genesis from the time of Eden until today there was never a time where God was in the human being like our time. So our time is where God says I will even be in [Applause] God whom you worship is in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he say I will be with you. &gt;&gt; I will be with you was them. &gt;&gt; I will be in you. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The throne of God, Christ is erected in your heart and he's sitting on God's throne. But in the millennia on his own throne, which he saw that he'd raise up a man, his son, David's son, to sit on the throne. Amen. Amen. Listen to what is saying attentively. &gt;&gt; All along he was with them. Now is with is in us. He's in us again. Then when we go to the rapture to the millennium, he's no longer in us but is with us. We reign with him. separate himself from us to him as a stand alone. So that we can look at him. We can look at him. He can look at us is the groom. We are the bride. That is the millennium. Like a young man, you don't tell us, but you know the kind of a woman you want. That woman, that woman is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When he's in you at the right time, we will be with her. And then when we are with her, we will be able to tell them, the bride and the groom. That's what is happening. We were in God. Now God is in us at the millennium. God will be with us. We will be his bride. We will be our groom. And it goes on and on and on like that. And let me just stop here by just asking you this question because do you love him? Do you believe him? Are you sick and tired of Satan's kingdom? you believe is coming to the millennium to this millennium to this Eden. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand to our feet. Amen. Amen. If you love him, if you believe in him, sick and tired of the things of the world, the kingdom of Satan, you believe we are going to the millennium. God richly bless you. That's where we are going. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can sing for us &gt;&gt; as &gt;&gt; will come. Amen. I love him. Oh, I love [Music] &gt;&gt; I love thee. &gt;&gt; My redeemer. &gt;&gt; My redeemer. [Music] I love the [Music] &gt;&gt; I love [Music] I love &gt;&gt; my redeemer. &gt;&gt; I redeemer. Oh, I love you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I love you. I love you. [Music] Oh, I love you. [Music] My redeemer. &gt;&gt; Christ died for me. &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Yes. [Music] Oh, [Music] I love I love you. I love you. Oh my [Applause] [Music] [Music] god. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh, I love you. I love you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you my precious elder. May the Lord richly bless you. I believe we are all happy. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask just to come and say a word of prayer and after we will get into the baptism. Amen. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Okay. boy. I'm Hallelujah. [Music] You give us exactly. You never miss even an inch. Every time when we come here, you give us what we need. Soon and very soon. 300. Our brothers [Applause] We know the pastor there is something special. [Applause] Hallelujah. when he's getting old. Amen. On the secret place. Hallelujah. is in fasting to renew even today. Amen.
