My pastor, my father has requested me to come here. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] two things [Music] and if possible I will do the third one. But two things I'm going to do is dedicating the ch dedicating the children and ordaining a pastor That's That's what I'm here for. As you read the word of God for the children. Mark chapter 10 from verse 13 to verse 16. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciple rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God." Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter there in. and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them. There is something that those parents have detected in Jesus. Hallelujah. They didn't just bring their children there. They know if Jesus touch them, something will happen to their children. I believe these women who are bringing their children here, they discovered something in the pastor here. [Music] But if they can bring their children to him, something will happen to their children. I'm here standing in the place of my pastor. And I believe what is in the pastor is in me [Applause] and if they bringing if they believe the pastor here they must believe me also then I'm going to take these children into my hands. as Jesus has done that. I'm going to take them into mine. But you may sit down believing that Jesus is going to use these hands of God because I believe 100% that I am his shepherd. [Applause] He is the shepherd. If he is in me, I am the shepherd. What is the name of the child? Let's close our eyes. My dear heavenly father, you are always present where your children are gathered.

If you just read 1 verse 1-3 Revelation 1 verse 1-3 1 verse 1-3 then Revelation 22:16 then Revelation 22 verse 16 Revelation 1 verse 1-3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Amen. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. Amen. Revelation 22 verse 16.

Amen. Bring your message to your children. I pray in the precious name of our savior Jesus Christ. Amen. You may take your seats. I'm just going to be very short. Um my topic is following the angel. Um topic that does this angel has anything to do with us. The angel we have read here. The Bible says here that is the book of revelation. He said is the revelation of Jesus Christ. He said um which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come. He says he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John. The Bible says it's a revelation of Jesus Christ. And he said God has shown it to Jesus Christ. Then he signified them by his servant. They said Jesus while he was still here, there were some things which he didn't know. He said about the coming about my coming nobody knows. He said even the son don't know only the father. But the Bible says our prophet says after his dead and resurrection then he received from the father the revelation of those things. Even the the disciples wanted to ask him, "When are you going to restore the kingdom?" He said, "No, it is not unto you to know things which my father has placed in his mind. It was not yet revealed to him at the time. But now we are following this angel. The Bible says here in Rubapter 19, John says, "This angel said to John, this angel himself, I am not God. I am the prophet. Don't worship me. It was the angel. Let's just read it. Revelation chapter 19 verse 9 to 10. Chapter 22. Reb, Revelation chapter 19 verse 9- 10 verse 9-10. And he said unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. All right? And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See, thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony, he said, don't worship God. worship God. But let's see in Reb 22 verse 82 from verse 8 to 11 to 11. And I John saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things. Then said he unto me, "See thou, do it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book, worship God." Amen. And he said unto me, "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand." And he that is unjust, let him be unjust still. And he which is filthy, let him be filthy still. And he that is righteous, let him be Russia still. And he that is holy, let him be holy still. This prophet, this this angel when he was showing John these things, John thought he was God. He wanted to worship them. But that angel said, "I'm not God. I am a prophet. But when you read the book of Revel 22:16, there 16 Jesus said, "I have sent my angel." Jesus is calling this angel, his angel. Hallelujah. Then in in Revelation chapter 21, law 21 verse 9 verse 9 and verse 15 verse 15- 16 verse 15- 16 here the Bible tells us that this angel measured the city but in the and when we read the book of future home future home we find that the prophet says, "I measure the destiny." But here the Bible says this angel measured. But here the prophet says I measured the the seem it it shows us that this is the theophony of this prophet. [Applause] He said Jesus Christ has sent him to testify this thing to the churches in in Malachi 3 verse one. Before Jesus came, Malachi said, I sent my messenger to forun me because the word you are looking for will soon come to his temple. He said he will send his message because the body they were looking for. He will come to his temple. But before the what they were looking for can come to his temple. He he he will send his messenger. What did those people think about this thing? the messenger who will be sent before him. When that messenger come which was John, they were there still looking for the messenger. But that messenger has come. Then we have got another voice in 1933 when my prophet was baptizing the 17th person. The same voice came. He said as John has forun my first coming you shall for my sins. He is the messenger. Jesus said he is my messenger here. God said I will send my message. But there in in in Ohio river God said I your message will forrun my second coming because John's message for my second my first coming. What did the people thought about that even now? People will never see this angel when he is for running his second country. They will want to know who is this angel. Some will never will never even take care about that angel. But some will look who is this angel. I wish this morning that I had just much time to spend upon this phenomena that's beyond any shadow of doubt proven for the past 30 years 35 years right here at this church since down on the river when that same light came down here in Jefferson in 1933. He spoke those ways as John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Jesus Christ. Your message will forrun the second coming. We are at the end time. We see it. We wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth. Maybe sometimes we'll have a chance to explain that if God willing this angel is he was he was the theophony of this angel here. He showed John those things. and he showed us these things. Amen. He is the same angel. The B brother says, he says, "When the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed, down comes the angel, the messenger, Christ, setting his foot upon the land. and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head. Now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. When this one is coming down with the book in his hand, this one is on earth. Before we can look at this book, but we must read chapter 5. But we find the book in the hand of the one who seated on the throne. But we must first of all we must know how the book got inside that. Then we read John 1 vers1. In John 1 vers1 it says in the beginning was the way and the weight was with God and the weight was God. The prophet said if we want to read it we can say in the beginning was a theophony theophony. was with God and the was God and the Bible says everything was made by that. That is what the Bible says. In other words, John 1 verse one. It is it happened before Genesis 1 verse 26 to 28 26-28 when God was saying let us create men in our image he was a theophony in John 1 verse1 the spirit came down in a form that the man could have an idea what God is. And when he came in that form, he was a theophony. He came in that form so that he can create. When he create, he created man in his own image. The man he created in his own image. He was a theophony. Then in Genesis chapter 2 we see God forming man out of the dust of the earth. When he has formed man of dust of the earth he took that and put it in that man. He took the creation and put it in the formation. Then Adam became a living when when he fell because a theophony is God's part of God. But when Adam fell, God cannot fail. So God took his part out of the formation and the formation remained there. Then it was Adam that has taken his took he took all the put them in his hand in the form of a book and he was there sitting in his room that is our theophony because they say in that book there are names then names there. They are the names of the redeemer. Then he he place them there so that he must do the work of redemption so that he can take them back in that formation. Amen. To take them back there, he must do the work of redemption. He came himself flesh. do the work of redemption and during seven church ages as he was a son of God. He was doing the work of redemption bringing us back so that we can go back to our glorified bodies. We can now go back to our glorified bodies in in that in that fallen form. He had to come and and and make a way for us to get into our original voice. He he he did that during seven church ages. As a son of God, he was a mediator during seven church age. But our prophet told me at the end of the seven churches at the end of the dispens of the son of God and between the dispense of the son of God and the son of David. The son of man must be revealed again. According to Luke 17 verse 30 verse 30. The son of man must be revealed at the end of the dispensation of the son of God. And when the son of god dispensation, it means he is no more a because he's changing to another dispensation. The dispensation of the God is flesh. Then we see that angel because that dispensation can come. This this man, he had to go to the west to connect to connect with what? with this angel because in the pyramid there there was a west stone that must be revealed and this man to know this because it was another ministry. He must go and connect this this man here who is will must connect with this angel because Jesus said I sent this angel to the churches. He had the message of all the churches. Amen. To complete because there is a pyramid pyramid here where we see the first church age being and we see the messenger there. Above there we see another small pyramid in that it is written love. that pyramid pyramid is what the prophet went west for. Because he was taken into the pyramid of angels. He said those angels they are the ones who brought the book to him. That is what he said. That is what he said and they brought the book means that I went there to connect with the angel's message and come back with what the interpretation. What is that interpretation? [Music] [Applause] He said it seven times to something I have seen. He said I needed an interpretation but it was flying that interpretation. But when he's coming back where was the interpretation now in him? Amen. Because he connected [Applause] with the interpretation. He said that angel spoke to me. Which one? The notable angel. He was the one who showed these things. He is the one who is showing us these things. [Applause] He said, "The son of man revealed himself through the prophet. through the prophet. In other words, Christ himself revealed himself in the prophet. It was Christ in him. He came, the Bible says in this he took the book from the one who was sitting on the throne. took the book. When the when when the announcement was given, he said the line of the tribe of Luca has the tribe of Judah Judah has prevailed. But when John looked, he saw a lamb. But the the message said lion It was a changing of dispensation when he stood there. When he stood there as a lamb, he was a mediator. He was doing the redemption work because there was names in my name. [Music] Then when he was doing that after he took the book, he said, "He who overcometh shall sit with me in my throne because I have overcome and aced with my father in his throne. Hallelujah. What is father's truth? The Lord you are looking for will come to his truth. What is God's truth? Jesus is God's truth. Amen. Amen. He said he seated with his father in his father's thromb. If he is in you, in other words, you have got the son and the father in you. Amen. Amen. He took the book from the throne. Where was his father? He his father was in his throne was Jesus. It's Jesus himself. In other words, if he took the book from he took it from within himself [Applause] and open when he when he took the book, he became a lion. After he's taken the book, he become a lion. The Bible says when he was coming, he rode this lion. That's why the angel said the lion the lion has prevailed to take the boot. Now he is the lion. The lion means he is the king. He is the He is the king of the bride. Amen. [Music] This is the angel when when when he when the earthly angel come. He came with the interpretation. The interpretation was with it. Amen. He said, "I come back with the in." He said, "Those angels brought that book." And when we read, we see Christ bringing the book. When when this angel received the book, He received it in a form of a sword. When he was wondering, they said it was a book in your hand. Let me change and take another position. Where is the pastor is going to be ordained here? Can you stand up? Thank you my brother. God bless you. Where are the people who have come with him? God bless you. [Applause] I am I am ordained by this pastor. He just he didn't just ordain me. He saw something. It was not just It was not just because people said we want this man to be but the pastor himself. Pastorship is a very important position among the five-fold ministry. Pastorship is an important position because he is shephering all those position. Even when they brought people, they bring them to the pastor to shepherd them. He is not a man-made man. He's not chosen by man. He's chosen by God. [Applause] It's not the man who can say I want to be a I when you see 10 people count them 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 is 10 then I can be a pastor of these people tell them I I'm the pastor then this man hey what about you choose more to be It is not like that is a God given position. It's not the man that can say I want to be a pastor. What is that? It is a godgiven position. Read Jeremiah Jeremiah 23:1-4. Jeremiah 23 verse 1-4. Who be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture? Say the Lord. Amen. Therefore, thus say the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people. Ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not gathered them. This is the time of gathering the sheep and God must set a pastor. Not man, but God. I read this in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament there, we read about these things that um brother Brennham says in those days when the owner of the sheep, not when the sheep needed the shepherd, but when the owner needed the shepherd. Thus said the prophet. He said in those days for a sheep for a shepherd cares for the sheep which is not the his he's look he cares for the sheep which is not his in the old testament the Great shepherd was used to describe leaders who protected and ke and guide God's people in the Old Testament. Are you together with me? The word pastor is shepherd. That's the prophet. The word pastor is shepherd. Then in the old testament when they talk about pastors they were talking about people who cared who protected who guided God's people. Example of those people were priests, judges, prophets, kings. Those people were classed as pastors. They were classed as shepherds. Was choosing them. People were going there. Let's just choose this man. God himself [Music] when when people went on they start to choose themselves. That's why when God comes here he said who unto those shepherds God is saying the same thing even now because pastorship is attacked by crooks. [Applause] who are not god orained pastors. These priests, judges, prophets, when whatever whenever you take something, you must stud it from back and you must bring it here. You mustn't just you must understand where this thing come from. [Applause] They were shepherd of God's people. I mean those priests judges we see them in Jeremiah. God said I will set up shepherd over them. His people Israel I said in those days when the owner of the ship needed a shepherd, he had to get the best shepherd. He must be a special trained man who knows to take care of the sheep. Listen here. There is there is something little there is little something in those sheep in those sheep that they see about that shepherd. This sheep could recognize something in that man that this man is a shepherd. That's why the prophet says we we recognize the gift in a man. Then we ordained that man to be a shepherd because we have recognized that gift. We don't just ordain a man. In the book of revelation, book of symbols, the prophet says, the word shepherd, the word is a shepherd. Let me just see if I can find the book first. Here he said the word shepherd, the word pastor is a shepherd and they chosen by God. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer over his ships. He said here, let me just read it. Uh he said um therefore I read it in the in the middle of the therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he is feeding you straight because that the word pastor means shepherd. Look it up. Find out if that that is not right. A pastor is a shepherd. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer. People have made him oversee. The Bible say the Holy Ghost has made him oversee. Not these little boys. stand. We are pastors. The Holy Ghost has made him oversee. [Applause] That is what the prophet says here over his church. Flock to feed them with what? The word of God. The prophet says the pastor is the husband of the church, he must impregnate it. Hallelujah. If he if he is terror, he's a he's he's a shepherd. He's a husband, but he's But he must impregnate. That church is full of argument, lies, backbiting, The Holy Ghost which has made him shepherd brings the message directly to him not to the sheep when a sheep says I've seen goat because the prophet says the holy ghost take the message directly to the shepherd. If it is a god orained shepherd, but if he's not god orained shepherd and their great their great chief shepherd, the one who has made them will reward them. will reward these pastors. He he has ordained them. He will reward them. They don't need a reward from someone. They are looking after the sheep which which is not theirs. They have got the owner of the sheep. The owner of the sheep, he is looking at the shepherd to take care. But in fact, my brother, the owner take the boot of the shepherd to take care of his sheep using the body of this man. [Applause] Pastorship is an office not elected by men. but elected by God. Let me read something here is chosen by me. But let me read what the prophet say. There is five offices elected of God for God for God has said in the church apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists. God did that. Man has deacons. Men has deacons. In other words, deacons are chosen by us, but pastors are chosen by said the prophet. Who has chosen you? But God set in the church for the perfecting of the church. You can't divide it. We identify the gift in a man. Then we ordain the man because we have identified the gift in a man. Guess why? Guess that's why my pastor he said he said not me. He said I identify the gift in this man. [Music] Not me, not my church. He would have he would have receive refused. He would have refused. Let me tell you the the way I know my pastor nonsense. He doesn't take any nonsense. Now, now the Bible times, the way they ordain a minister was recognizing a gift of God in the ministry in the Bible church where they ordain a minister, they recognize a gift of God in that in that in minister's ministry. Then he said here they notice him being a staunch Christian a gift of speaking. Here he's talking about Timothy. That is the way they did also to the ministers by laying hands given the right hand of fellowship to work together. Where is we can call the brother to come forth. [Music] Amen. Come fight here. [Music] [Music] Kneel [Music] down here. Kneel down here in front of the pastor. The pastor will uh the pastor will lay his hands upon you to ordain you as a pastor. That is the old way of making ordaining people to be ministers. [Music] You know the name. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Heavenly Father, here we come again. Yes. This is the heavenly ministry.

Then Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Amen. We will sing a song as they come forth.
