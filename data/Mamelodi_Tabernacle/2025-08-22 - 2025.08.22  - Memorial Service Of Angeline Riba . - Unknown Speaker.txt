As we are going to we are coming to comfort the family of river we can say God knows better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to bring the greetings from our pastor is I was with him before I came here and then he said I must pass the greetings the family the children of God and all the affected people. He say the only one that can comfort you is our Lord Jesus Christ. so you know I'm a brief speaker. I think 30 minutes is enough try to time. Amen. So let's open our Bible in the book of Job chapter 14 verse 14-1 17. Job chapter 14. &gt;&gt; Oh, before we read, &gt;&gt; my brother can lead us in prayer. Amen. Amen. Amen. We know very well in the natural we are affected in different ways. [Music] Lord. [Music] Amen. our elder for tonight to present your word. Amen. [Music] Amen. Amen. We pray your mercy upon him and everyone who here father through your servant this evening &gt;&gt; to comfort each and every one of us trusting and believing in the wonderful name of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can read. &gt;&gt; We read the book of Job chapter 14 from verse 14 to 17. If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come. Thou shalt call and I will answer thee. Thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands. For now thou numberest my steps. Dust thou not wash over my sin? My transgression is sealed up in a back and thou seest up mine iniquity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; So my title for the message this evening is about verse 14 and it's a question. If a man die, shall he live again? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh you would remind me at the at the end of the sermon &gt;&gt; we must sing that song says amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh we we have the law of God and the law of signs. The law of signs says what goes up will come down. But the law of God says what came down will go up. In other words, it tells us that those that comes from God above will go back to God. We are always against the law of science and the things of the world because they have limitation but we go beyond the death and we normally say and I've seen brother said it as well here he say when a person is born we call it a sunrise when you depart But it's a sunset. And brother Brenham says as well, when the sun comes, it's a sunrise. When it goes down is a sunset, the sun is born and the sun will die. So I will show you the quote. When brother Brenham says all those things, well, you know, I said the other day that we need to look at the life of brother Brennan. It was not an easy life and do not expect an easy life. That is why the Bible says when we get there, we will be called more than conquerors. You cannot call more than a conqueror if you didn't have a battle to fight. Every piece of life in your own life it's a battle you will fight and you must win so that you can be more than a conqueror. Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the nights says I know how hard it was that night when I woke in that little old colored mission. &gt;&gt; Colored mission out there. &gt;&gt; Yes. The black church, black people's church. Amen. Amen. You know, you don't know how hard it was in the olden days when they look at the people, especially the black people, they didn't consider them as Christian. And it came to brother Brham as well. And he said it was hard. &gt;&gt; And all the white folks standing around there said, "There he goes in a colored mission. It was hard. I walked up there with a whole lot of Kentucky pride in me like that. But God saw the heart of brother Brennan. He came close to brother Brennan and said to him, "If you want it, walk right on in there." And I walked right in there and nailed down to an altar and there I stayed. He said I died the old self [Music] you know Brenham &gt;&gt; 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The man of God says, "If you say that's a funeral, well, brother, if there was ever a time where we needed a funeral, the time is right now when men will die to theirelves right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So brother Brenham was an ordinary person like ourselves. But what make him different gift that God put in him because he was a prophet. He was a prophet. We see God in flesh through the life of brother. Then he said the the old me must die. There must be a funeral of the old me so that I can be worthy for the gospel. I was crucified with Christ yet I live. Not me, but Christ himself. Someday in that glorious resurrection when he comes my body may be resting beneath the sought out yonder. But it when it does, you will see the grass move back. And I will come forth in his great glorious image. Beside many of them, hallelujah. For I know him in the power of his release. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said so that your your self, &gt;&gt; your old you must come to an end must be buried come to a funeral where the the old you die the new you will come in for that is the life of Christ in you. Amen. Amen. Brother Brennham says beforeh he had an opportunity of talking to him and brother Bosworth was saying to brother Brenham Bill I'm going brother was like you're not going to go bos said to him God bless you brother God bless you sister hallelujah and after some time he departed That's how a man of God live this world. Not like those that called me so and so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not those that they will say call me so and so to apologize before I go. But a child of God is forever ready. God make you ready the day you leave. Just close your eyes because heaven has come. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will tell you the testimony the other day of what I've seen. Brother Brenham says he was praying for brother's family about this man. Then he said, "Oh blessed God, As as as Christian, we bow our head to the dust from where we came. Someday we shall return if Jesus returns. There is one who has walked amongst us, preach to us, thy humble and holy servant, brother FF tonight, his body lays in a casket, but his soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; And across the border, he was coming down to the river the other morning and the waves was flying high in the air at the old Jordan. We know that there was many friends to meet him preach Christ to them by preaching the gospel. that by the cause he had brought them to a saving knowledge of thy dear son and they were there to meet him. We trust that you'll blessed this gallant soul. You bless this guy. And let us remember by his life and his example and his teaching and how he firmly firmly stood by eternal weight until he lived to be a ripe old age many way many years over the loted time. I'm giving this example because we know we are bearing a gallant soldier of God. I know Mar as someone with other mamas warriors worship warriors. And I always say be scared of the prayer of a woman. When a woman pray, God listen and he will answer accordingly. I want to tell you this because I have experienced something. Well, let me just give you the tip a little bit before I continue. Last Sunday when sister Dudo was testifying there, I'm the eyewitness. From day one, if the pastor had admitted in this battle, I was there. Even today, I was with him. But I want to tell you this when we were at the hospital. I'm just saying this because Amen. Oh. Let me put it this way. When you are a shepherd, go for gold, sheep, donkeys, cattle and so forth, you you have field where you plow maybe millime or whatever. When that moment you have ripped what you saw, the stock remain in the field there because you fence the area. Comes a time whereby now you feel like your animals can indulge themselves there. Now you have taken them to &gt;&gt; I'm saying this because I was a bit you know not saying anything &gt;&gt; but today I can talk. Amen. Amen. When I arrived with my wife early in the morning around 11:00, the pastor came out of the wister in when I get in I the doctor came in as well and the two nurses as well later what's happened but I want to focus on this one. When I'm in there, the pastor was talking something I did not understand like he is going. He see Jesus and he was laughing. He was so happy. Then I stood there looking at him. I don't know what happened. Something triggered to manga. He came then on the opposite of where I'm standing. The pastor was laying on the bed and the pastor was keep on saying Jesus is calling me. I see his hand. I am going and I had said to the pastor, you know what? You will not die. When you come to the hospital here, you were alive. You will leave the hospital alive. I'm not going to take you out of this hospital with a plastic or a casket. And when I look at her face, it's a very serious faith. Then I was just quiet there. As the master was talking about the program, &gt;&gt; brother, make sure the pastors are there. Make sure the order is in place. Let the children of God. I'm going. Then said, you not going to go in. I said, I I respect such. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When a woman prayed, when a woman had a wish, it wasn't exactly like that. I will tell you the full story the other day what I've experienced. I'm saying this because the family of Reeba should just settle. Mama is in a better place. God has prepared for her. I'm going to read about a woman here because we are burying a woman here and brother Brennham was responsible. I'm going to tell you the little story. Brother Brandham says, "I was speaking at a funeral service other day for an little old lady about 85 years of old that went to meet the Lord and she was a sweet little old woman." That was the mother to a friend of brother Brennan &gt;&gt; called Lloyd. That was the madam just passed away. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Fort Mrs. &gt;&gt; He said this they amongst the poorest of the poor lord. The boy who give me the legging. We have been chs since little boys. He's just a little older than me than I. And I said to him, Lloyd Lloyd, &gt;&gt; what would you want me to take the funeral text from? That's what brother Brenham &gt;&gt; asked brother Lloyd Lloyd. &gt;&gt; Then brother Lloyd responded brother Brenham and he said I would like you for you to speak on this if is the will of the Lord. just some assurance that my mother will be back again. Brother said &gt;&gt; very well. &gt;&gt; So he took the text from the book of Job where we just read now as our title this evening. If a man die, shall he live again? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If a man die, shall he live again? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brenham was preaching in the funeral. Then he said after being missionary &gt;&gt; and traveling the world. I've had a privilege of seeing many gods, the philosophies, philosophy of life and what people worship and in all of it about all of it is a philosophy &gt;&gt; outside of Christianity. Christianity has the truth. Amen. Brother says he was all over the Buddhism, the Arabic worshiping the gods in Africa. He was looking at them, how they do things. But he said Christianity is outstanding. One good reason. the person who's responsible for the Christianity died and rise again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Islamic people &gt;&gt; are still waiting even today to come. He died and never come back. Our Lord Jesus Christ died and rise at the third day until the soldiers were told were told that when the people ask him you must tell them that they are his disciples came at night and stole him. He was never stolen. He arrived. They they failed to see that Jesus was God in flesh. Today the people fail to see that you are God in flesh. If they want to see God today, if they want to hear from God today, they must not go far. must come to you because Christ whom they crucified is in you is him walking talking through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know that this world is a creation and before there can be a creation, there must be a creation. There's nothing &gt;&gt; that just came. &gt;&gt; As long as there's a creation, there is a creator. &gt;&gt; And this creator express himself in his creation. If we did not even have a Bible, we will still know that the truth just as we do. The Bible just put things in order. You are the one order of God, the manifestation of who God is. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now God creating the creation is expressing himself back in the creation and he makes us different. We are not the same. We cannot be the same. Our God is God of heaven and others we make them rich and they remain rich and others he made them poor it's God who did that don't blame him I'm reading about a poor woman here but I want to tell you this brother Benham says that woman as poor as she All she has to teach the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but the rich people when you ask something they will say go and work because I work harder to achieve this. And you go and try harder, you become more poorer. Because God has never gave you the richness of this he this earth has gave you the richness of heaven. Don't be like somebody. But we got a place to serve God. And that's the place he placed us in. &gt;&gt; If we'll just abide in that place. If you can just stay right in the word of God, he is doing everything for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you don't need to tell the people if you have something that do not have and say I work harder, I pray harder. If God &gt;&gt; gave you and if he gave you, &gt;&gt; give others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I have a friend of mine who were at school together at a high school. He is one of the richest people in in in &gt;&gt; Can you just give me a piece of your he said &gt;&gt; the following day when I tried to phone He blocked me. I realize is the life we're living in because I'm going to &gt;&gt; and then when brother was reading the the job scripture at the funeral he gave example and said as I said now watch the little flower. This was along October. died and the little seed turned back to the earth and God is having the funeral service in these four rains. This great big drops of tear dropping from the skies bearing them and coming up through Kentucky. I said other day upon the big chest of the mountains he set out his bits across the earth [Music] the leaves brown red is in bereiement because the res is dead and he buried them beneath the ground and He knows just as sure as the earth comes back around the line of the sun again every one of them will rise again but it's just a routine he goes through speak to us that there is a resurrection I notice here the sun in the morning rise And it's a little baby when it's born. The sun like a little baby when it's supposed to warm the earth. [Music] It cannot warm the earth in the morning and it's about 8:00. It start of the grammar school about 10 or 11. He's got his education. At noon time is the middle age. 2:00 in the afternoon is striking my age. 5:00 is my father's age and sister back there and after a while that glorious thing that lit up the earth saved God's purpose died out yonder in the west the sunrise and the sun set it's born and it Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the end of it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is born a new rise up the next morning again. &gt;&gt; God in every faith. A child of God who was born live the life until you die at the west at the noon time. At the noon time, is it the end of you? No. &gt;&gt; Bright morning shall come again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That is why the body will be put incorruptible and rise again. Incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our mama has departed at his her old age, but he will rise as young again. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible teaches us. &gt;&gt; Now you see then I said why there's one requirement and I love to say this in the church like this. There's one requirement that is required there no matter how beautiful the seat is. It must be gitized. It got to be gitized. And if it does serve God's purpose because the beex that Poland and so forth. So Job was looking at the life of the tree. He saw how tree get dried up, how flowers fell on the on the ground. But one day that flower having the seed and the seed going down thinking is dead. But when the rain come, the seed brought forth itself 10 times. When the when the devil thought he found you, he thought you are dead. That's when you are buried by God. But one of the days I will call you up. But then the master of all it says, "Yes, But the the the little lily couldn't make conflict. &gt;&gt; We all have a thing like we do. We all have a things like we do. Amen. We serve God in the category that we put in and it becomes back the same. &gt;&gt; That is why The thieves they will die thieves and rise thieves a children of God will die a children of God. We will rise as a children of God. Death is not going to change you. But the way you are the way God has put you in the word of God. He wants you to serve him as you are. So if you think you are poor is God loved you to be like that. I can repeat myself. The way you are is the way God wants you to be. Serve God in that condition. There's something good waiting for you. I said she was poor as poor could be. But nobody could ever come to her door or need but what she would give to them. No what I'm trying to say no matter you can come to a door or needy. Amen. But you will give to them. The neighbors, no matter what trouble they was in, this woman, &gt;&gt; Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Ford, &gt;&gt; any hour of the night, was there to help do anything she could do what she had to do with. You know the poor people is just using the way are the one that gives than those that are rich. Did you know that it's always the case? When you ask a brother maybe something or money for transfer, you will say, "Brother, you must pray so that God can bless you." But when you ask the poor, I don't have money or will money to go to the service. He will try and give you because God made us impart life. You know brother Brenham saying when you reach that life of Christianity the real Christianity is when you no longer live for yourself but live others. Have you ever seen a mama who staying in a shack happy as she is when sweeping the floor and singing the song happy with the kids? The only full meal they can have is bread and mearine. start happily. But the rich people from the most expensive suburb mama riding his her own car driving a car, daddy her own car, the kids there angry as they go out of the complex. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are earthly prosperity. does not determine the prosperity in the word of God. Amen. I even see in the church check after service when we go home those that have money they go for lunch &gt;&gt; somewhere in the most expensive when they see you pass through the window what does he want here he mustn't enter because we're going to pay the bill for you but those that do not have you'll find themselves but it's that is the only thing they can afford and I said above that you know I I have an opportunity of seeing that seed deitized by the Holy Spirit she was born again of the spirit of God. I said now we are going to and say she will not rise again. It's a question. If you say she won't rise again, the leaf didn't go down to the bottom of the tree before the frost fell to hide itself to come back next year with a new leaf. If that lay the substate up in that tree, the frost froze and heat death, it will kill that gem of life. That same in that s and the tree will die. But some intelligency, it has none of its own. some intelligency. It has none of its own life. It has no intelligency. But somebody, something controls it. Brothers and sisters, you have no intelligence. how you were born, how you will live, how you will die, how you will resurrect, but there's something in you that controls you. You are part of God and is God doing that. That is why will say just be the mechanics. He will be you know the dynamic. Let him have a control in your life. When you live, you live for him. When you die, you die for him. When you resurrect, you resurrect for him. He made you to be an offspring of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that what does that what intelligency the same intelligency controls our own life there's a certain intelligence that is controlling our own life we cannot help ourselves that's why we will need him she will arise again someday she just got it all our will rise again one day. That is the nature that God has put in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before you could say she will not you'd have to say there's no springtime. There's no resurrection of the seed. There's no summer and winter. There's no rising and setting of the sun. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as the word of God. Why? It will be crazy to say such thing. There is a resurrection and just show the world flows around the face of the sun. It gives commissions by God himself to raise up with his warm rays. life. Life needs the son. Our life need the son, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; My last quote, &gt;&gt; it says, "Now, I like this one. That's why it's my closing quote. Listen to it." Now, if I drop this piece on the floor, it went down &gt;&gt; and I come over here and pick up something similar to the piece I throw down. Now, that isn't resurrection. Do you hear that? That's replacement. But the resurrection is to bring this same one up and the same one will come again. That is the resurrection. The body that we lay in the ground, the same body should rise again, not a replacement, but when it comes again is young. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we go down &gt;&gt; motor immortal &gt;&gt; and we slept of that day. Our whole Christian life built right there and right there alone.
