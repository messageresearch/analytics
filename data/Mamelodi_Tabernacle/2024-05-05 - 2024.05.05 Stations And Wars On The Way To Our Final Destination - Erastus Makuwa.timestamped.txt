[1:12:59] there was a Ministry before the
[1:13:04] gate and there is a Ministry after the
[1:13:10] G then now we are in the ministry after
[1:13:15] the
[1:13:20] gate because they G
[1:13:23] there is where and Eve gone
[1:13:30] through when they were driven out of the

[1:13:35] Eden and God placed the Cherub there
[1:13:39] with the
[1:13:42] SW the way back to the tree of
[1:13:47] life then now it
[1:13:51] showed we have reached the gate again
[1:13:56] because after they were driven
[1:14:01] away God made a
[1:14:05] plan to bring them back again the Gard
[1:14:08] of
[1:14:11] Eden in his

[1:14:36] second he was the
[1:14:40] restored then he had to restore
[1:14:46] Eve because Eve was taken out of
[1:14:51] Adam then he had to put Adam in ad deep
[1:14:59] sleep at Calvary
[1:15:02] day then he took out of
[1:15:07] Adam through the
[1:15:10] blood the second
[1:15:13] Eve then to take out the second
[1:15:17] Eve he had to
[1:15:19] build through seven Church
[1:15:27] then when we reach the seventh
[1:15:30] one then we reach the
[1:15:33] end and when we reach the
[1:15:36] end then we the our Prophet the seventh
[1:15:39] angel messenger
[1:15:43] received because that was the way
[1:15:46] towards the
[1:15:49] game then when we reach

[1:15:57] there the book was
[1:16:01] taken because our names were
[1:16:05] there and when the book was
[1:16:08] taken then the lamp broke the
[1:16:12] sa because he took the book from the
[1:16:15] hand of the one who sat on the
[1:16:19] throne and that book was the book of
[1:16:23] redemption when he had taken the book
[1:16:27] then he opened the
[1:16:29] SE then he took the book and gave it to
[1:16:32] the seventh
[1:16:35] angel when the seventh angel messenger
[1:16:37] received
[1:16:39] the he received the book in a form of a
[1:16:45] sword then he received the
[1:16:48] sword it was the book in the form of a
[1:16:52] s he was given that book
[1:16:55] to reveal that book to
[1:16:58] us why he received
[1:17:02] the the first the SW was burning the
[1:17:05] people from getting the tree of
[1:17:09] [Music]
[1:17:12] life but now in our day the S is leading
[1:17:16] us towards the tree of
[1:17:22] life that is why the prophet says in
[1:17:25] this book
[1:17:27] here after receiving the
[1:17:30] sword in the book why Christ speak the

[1:22:55] jhua he told them you can choose whether
[1:23:00] you want to worship that
[1:23:03] God
[1:23:09] father or the god of the
[1:23:12] Amor in which land you

[1:23:20] will worship the
[1:23:22] Lord Abraham's father
[1:23:26] as I was reading following his
[1:23:30] story I was told he was the he was
[1:23:34] making
[1:23:38] Idols selling
[1:23:44] them you see to be the child of
[1:23:48] God is
[1:23:51] predestination God knew that you will be
[1:23:54] his
[1:23:57] child Abraham was predestinated to be
[1:24:00] the child
[1:24:03] of while he was work working in his
