[1:10:54] so good and so wonderful
[1:10:57] he has done so much for us
[1:11:00] he has done so much that we don't have
[1:11:02] enough in our language
[1:11:04] to express what the lord has done
[1:11:07] we come in his presence with
[1:11:08] thanksgivings with praises with

[1:11:16] for the lord is good and reign forever
[1:11:19] amen let's give him another hand
[1:11:29] the bible says in the book of psalm
[1:11:31] 11617
[1:11:33] verse
[1:11:35] i will offer to thee the sacrifice of my
[1:11:38] thanksgiving
[1:11:40] and we'll call upon the name of the lord
[1:11:44] amen as the bible say count
[1:11:48] what the lord has done
[1:11:50] there are so many things that the lord
[1:11:52] has done in our lives we owe him our
[1:11:55] time
[1:11:56] we owe him all that we are
[1:11:58] for him our lives
[1:12:01] and there is nothing that we can hold
[1:12:04] away from our god
[1:12:06] because he deserves the best of us
[1:12:09] we are here in his presence
[1:12:12] i trust that we are under expectation
[1:12:15] and i know the expectation of our heart
[1:12:17] will bring a good atmosphere
[1:12:20] and the atmosphere will take god into
[1:12:23] action
[1:12:24] and if somebody came expecting something
[1:12:27] from the lord
[1:12:28] he will leave this place satisfied
[1:12:32] you know there is one thing about our
[1:12:34] god

[1:13:09] i believe that though it was a short
[1:13:11] notice for some
[1:13:13] but everyone managed to make it
[1:13:17] because
[1:13:19] you can delay when they tell you you are
[1:13:21] going to be blessed
[1:13:24] you know there is something that we
[1:13:26] understand

[1:15:25] and we also thought it's going to be a
[1:15:28] blessing for this church
[1:15:30] to have him and
[1:15:31] after blessing us here we
[1:15:34] went to meet our elder pastor godima

[1:15:41] if we extend the blessing
[1:15:43] and the blessings to all of us it's
[1:15:45] going to be helpful for the church of
[1:15:48] the living god

[1:15:52] of you are also here tonight
[1:15:55] to just bring more fire to the blessings
[1:15:57] that we are being
[1:15:59] given here by the lord and

[1:23:46] to you
[1:23:58] let us go to the book of luke
[1:24:25] i'm just going to read
[1:24:27] verse 10.
[1:24:30] look 16
[1:24:34] from 10
[1:24:38] and then i'm going to add
[1:24:41] azaya
[1:24:56] isaiah 30 verse 18.
[1:25:05] let us start from luke
[1:25:07] 10
[1:25:08] look 16.
[1:25:26] he that is faithful in that which is
[1:25:28] least is faithful also in march
[1:25:30] he that is unjust in the list is unjust
[1:25:33] also in march
[1:25:47] is
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:19] foreign
[1:26:23] isaiah
[1:26:24] 30 from verse 18
[1:26:26] let us read
[1:26:28] it says and therefore will the lord wait
[1:26:31] that he may be gracious unto you
[1:26:33] and therefore will he be exalted that he
[1:26:36] may
[1:26:37] have mercy upon you for the lord is a
[1:26:40] god of judgment blessed are all
[1:26:43] day that wait for him
[1:26:46] let us pray
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:15] we have the first color which is red
[1:27:44] it is upon faithfulness that the faith
[1:27:45] of israel is blessed
[1:27:52] because when someone is faithful even in
[1:27:54] the list
[1:27:56] they shall be faithful even in march
[1:28:02] when you say that you accept something
[1:28:03] you must prove that you do really accept
[1:28:05] it
[1:28:08] that is why god looked upon this law
[1:28:10] would you see a church
[1:28:39] but because she lost one egg without
[1:28:42] getting a little tea
[1:28:43] and there was a farmer that took that
[1:28:44] egg and put it in the
[1:28:46] in the bunnies
[1:28:52] she lost an egg and that must be found
[1:28:54] somewhere
[1:29:08] but one time
[1:29:11] and she she made a shout out
[1:29:15] there is a diff that caught up to it
[1:29:19] and that little ego
[1:29:22] that small ego in yani
[1:29:25] the mother called her from the heavens
[1:29:31] but the the mama eagle did not land to
[1:29:34] where that small ego was
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:02] she said the voice that you are hearing
[1:30:59] when you have rejected the word you
[1:31:02] haven't rejected the word at all
[1:31:04] we cannot find someone who's in both
[1:31:06] sides
[1:31:09] there is strength
[1:31:14] you cannot
[1:31:42] faithful
[1:32:08] it's like
[1:32:23] she went in the forest
[1:32:26] with the little ones
[1:32:30] and they found themselves around honey
[1:32:38] the mama
[1:33:20] yes
[1:34:08] god is going to do things
[1:34:11] amen
[1:34:58] you must show that you want it
[1:35:02] when i'm behind my pastor
[1:35:06] he needs to know that this believer
[1:35:07] loves me
[1:35:12] when
[1:36:50] in the message only provided place of
[1:36:52] fellowship
[1:36:57] i need to
[1:36:58] watch so i can i can
[1:37:01] i can check my time
[1:37:41] sometimes we seem to forget that it's
[1:37:43] not the bigger things
[1:37:58] the strength of the chain is measured
[1:38:00] according to the link the the weakest
[1:38:03] link
[1:38:05] okay
[1:38:12] because they will have the right to
[1:38:14] enter into
[1:38:28] we are not
[1:38:42] things
[1:38:56] you love
[1:39:36] oh
[1:39:51] the bigger ones
[1:40:06] it is the life of a believer
[1:40:08] that is why israel israel israel
[1:40:11] israel
[1:40:13] in the flag
[1:40:14] there is blue
[1:40:16] why is that
[1:40:18] because they are faithful towards god
