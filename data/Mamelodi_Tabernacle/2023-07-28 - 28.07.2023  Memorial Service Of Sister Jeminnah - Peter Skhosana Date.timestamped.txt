[12:01] [Music]
[12:11] amazing
[12:15] do what we always do on everyday spaces
[12:21] there's nothing new that you are going
[12:23] to do
[12:26] just to read the word of God and
[12:35] couldn't feel well about
[12:38] Bautista and the reference
[12:44] and remind those who are still alive
[12:52] but there is life after death so
[12:58] thank you for being with us
[13:07] gracious Lord
[13:10] you are the same yesterday today and
[13:12] forever
[13:14] you never forsake us Lord
[13:18] even in times of troubles you're always
[13:20] on our side
[13:24] we travel from different places to come
[13:27] here Lord
[13:28] and be with the family of shandu
[13:32] after the departure of our sister sister
[13:35] gemina
[13:38] so as we're gathered here further
[13:41] we're just going to read the word
[13:44] and remind us Lord Almighty that this is
[13:47] not the end of the way
[13:49] and then we will check the position that
[13:52] we are in it
[13:54] and gracious Lord whatever we're doing
[13:57] here we invite you to be with us
[13:59] may you take control of the situation
[14:03] may you be the one Lord Almighty that
[14:06] will lead us forth
[14:07] thank you Father
[14:10] we pray and thank you in the name of our
[14:13] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[14:16] okay let's read from the book of
[14:20] First Corinthians I mean second
[14:23] Corinthians chapter 4
[14:27] second Corinthians chapter four
[14:30] I would like us to read
[14:33] that the Excellency of the power may be
[14:36] of God and not of us
[14:39] we are traveled on every side yet not
[14:42] distressed we are perplexed but not yet
[14:46] but not in despair
[14:50] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[14:53] but not destroyed
[14:55] always bearing about in the body the
[14:59] dying
[15:00] of the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[15:03] Jesus might be made manifest in our body
[15:12] so the
[15:15] verse chapter I mean verse 10 says
[15:20] uh
[15:21] so that the life of Jesus might be made
[15:25] manifest in our body
[15:31] I also would like us to read
[15:40] book of Colossians
[15:55] Colossians chapter 4
[15:57] versions
[16:00] sorry first Thessalonians chapter four
[16:03] and then let's read from verse 13 to 18.
[16:08] I think you are familiar with that
[16:12] chapter 4 from verse 13 to 18.
[16:16] but I will not have you to be ignored
[16:19] and Brethren concerning them which are
[16:22] asleep that is or not even as others
[16:26] which have no hope
[16:27] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[16:30] rose again even saw them also which
[16:33] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[16:37] for this we say unto you by the word of
[16:40] the Lord that we which are alive and
[16:43] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[16:45] not prevent them which are asleep
[16:48] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[16:51] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[16:53] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[16:56] and the dead in Christ shall rise fixed
[17:00] then we wish our alive and remain shall
[17:03] be caught up together with them in the
[17:05] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[17:09] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[17:11] wherefore Comfort one another with his
[17:14] ways
[17:15] thank you
[17:17] okay fine
[17:21] we I'm reading this verses waiting for
[17:24] the coming of the Lord
[17:27] there's something that should happen
[17:32] in our lives
[17:35] then we we always look back
[17:39] and look at the present
[17:42] um
[17:47] so now looking back
[17:50] we see how
[17:53] believers
[17:55] behaved
[17:59] they were waiting
[18:02] what we are waiting for well
[18:04] and here we are presently
[18:08] we are waiting really for what those
[18:12] that lived before us
[18:17] so we're also reaching the same way
[18:20] but we look at the future
[18:24] then we see the inheritance in the
[18:27] future
[18:32] inheritance in the future
[18:36] that gives us faith
[18:41] right the first verse that we reading
[18:47] that was in a second Corinthians chapter
[18:50] 4 verse 7.
[18:52] it says but we have treasure
[18:56] but we have this treasure in an earth
[19:00] anniversary
[19:04] so it says these these bodies are Ethan
[19:08] vessels
[19:15] there's a treasure within that verse
[19:21] now what is that treasure
[19:28] it is the revealed word
[19:33] the revealed word is a treasure
[19:38] because it gives you the revelation
[19:43] of your inheritance
[19:46] now anybody who is a Believer
[19:51] will always want the body to change
[19:57] there is a word that you receive on
[20:00] daily basis
[20:07] supposed to build a sun
[20:11] there should be a man within you
[20:14] the men within a man
[20:17] that is built by the word itself
[20:22] so now
[20:24] when you seek your inheritance
[20:29] you don't seek your inheritance by your
[20:32] mind
[20:34] there's somebody within you
[20:38] that seeks that inheritance
[20:41] okay you'll understand
[20:45] it says but we have this treasure in an
[20:48] earth
[20:52] that the Excellency of the power may be
[20:56] of God Amen and not of us
[21:00] we have this body
[21:03] which we live in it temporarily
[21:09] and then we all know that
[21:14] we are going to depart
[21:17] each and everyone that is sitting down
[21:20] knows that one day give you an example
[21:23] Abraham
[21:25] was told to leave his family
[21:31] and go to the promised land
[21:35] now when when he left that place
[21:39] there was somebody within him
[21:43] that was guiding him
[21:46] the Bible says he was looking for his
