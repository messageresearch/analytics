Description:
Title: The day of Redemption.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 24 September 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Ephesians 4:30, Revelation 22:16-17, Malachi 4:5, Ephesians 1:4 and Revelation 5:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the day of Redemption.

Sunday is the first day of the week it is the resurrection day.  On the resurrection day we must not do anything else but to serve the Lord.

There are people who know that Rapture is coming, and you can’t tell them otherwise because they didn’t read about it but they know that Rapture is coming. When something is about to happen, the Predestinated people will know about it as they are told about it. 

When God speaks some will hear from their ears and others from their Theophany. 

The Kingsman/The Family man come to die for us not as a stranger .The blood of the kingsman is the only thing that could redeem what was lost.  To redeem is to bring back to its original position. Through the blood we are family members, it means we are redeemed by the blood of the family Man. The Blood test shows whether you’re A Child of God or not.

If we were all in his image we would be having one church. When you see God coming to you it means God can recognise His image in you. God is not in the Church , He is in the people. 

The day of redemption is the day the book is opened, the day this Word is revealed to you is the day of redemption.
God has redeemed us because he has revealed the Seventh Seal to us. The day of your redemption is the day the Seventh Seal was revealed to you, then you are Free. 

The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

65-0221E Who Is This Melchisedec Par 88
60-1206 - "The Smyrnaean Church Age par 120
63-0317E - "The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals par 67-69

is if God speaks some will hear with their ears some will hear let me read you how some will here then I will reach Okay Kevin he's talking about somebody here I'll just take it from this kids he recognized the very word of God was Eagle's food he left the other things you leave the other things you have been formed into their living image of the Living God you have hid from your theory [Music] you look at the Samaritan woman how she said I don't know what what do you know I know the Rapture is do you know something he she knew something yeah before something happens they are told of it I mean and she said I know Messiah yeah and even when he's coming he will tell us meaning that there was no church that could I mean he was just waiting for the Messiah yeah there are some people even here amen you can't tell them the difference because they did not only read about it you know that woman said I know foreign [Music] amen and she went further when he is a guy tell us all things because no I will be watching the times like I was reading this podcast there was Jubilee in heaven you know we are not alone I don't know we are here remove in this Realms available but there are some of us in the sixth dimensions you know when Paul was taken up one time and he said where was he how can men reach this they said you know it was a full Taste of things because that would we also living now experience of things now that's why you see us we are on pilgrimage because and he predestinated them and they are here on Earth don't you think that they have a full taste because the Bible says he predestinated us before really where is it brother he ordered predestinated us before penny that's why we are called the Overcomers because we can overcome whatever the world can produce or what Satan can do Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4. according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world he has chosen Us in him foreign [Music] and you know the Bible says we are not of the world the Lord Jesus said that is the Book of John chapter 17 yeah John chapter 17. he says they are not of the world and because possible we are strangers and surgeons in this world amen

you want to keep along with Christ that can happen only if cells you are King to him I mean if he is I mean you see now now let me read this that's why here it says you've then been formed into the living image of the Living God because in Genesis image amen and usual that's why he okay for the image amen [Music] amen you know some people they you know that's why you see I'm here I won't go
