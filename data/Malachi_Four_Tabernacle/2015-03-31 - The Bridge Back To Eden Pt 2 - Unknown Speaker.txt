========================================
Lord that that is the only way oh God that toen can be shown father Lord is that that life of that blood the quickening power of the Holy Spirit Come into our hearts to our lives Quicken the inside of the inside baptizes us with the Holy Ghost give us father that which we have need of today we come surrendered in your presence father let not our will be done but let your will be accomplished father Lord all you need father is just one person surrender Lord completely in your hand father your Prophet said that becomes the voice the voice of God and one is surrender to your hand father help me oh God surrender oh God let your voice speak to to each one let it be you father in this hour Lord we come in this hour Lord to have you come and take preeminence in interpreter father your people father have the preeminence father Lord rule in rain in this hour that we are here gathered together everything bring it to your subjection and power father that your word might accomplish the purpose why it is being preached and the purpose why it's being given it's being preach father let not the enemy take away the seed that is being given let not the cares of Life choke the sea don't let the fowls of the air the the fouls in from the cage from Babylon a cage of every hateful and unclean bird let us be like Abraham this morning Father when the fouls tried to come over the sacrifice he scared them away to not contaminate his sacrifice and your Prophet said that was a type of the church the last days cast Spirits out oh God don't let any foul come and contaminate the word cast them away in the name of Jesus Christ that the pillar of fire might move among us as it did amongst the sacrifice Lord that lamp of fire to vindicate and UNC conditional Covenant oh God you put Abraham to sleep we recognize Lord that when a man is asleep he goes into his subcon not in his conscience anymore but in hisence so father when you come down to vindicate that Covenant with the pillar of fire the quickening power Lord make it so real father that it would be a covenant that it would be something that comes down deep into our subc conscience Lord and that is in the soul not in the first realm Lord or in the second realm but let it go deep down father into the subconscious into the soul into the heart for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he oh father let your word from the abundance of the heart let the mouth speak father Lord we recognize that it is not what goes into our mouths that contaminates us but it is what comes out for if we speak something that is not in our heart then we will be judged for our words Lord let us speak that which you reveal to our hearts speak by Revelation not by head knowledge not by hearing not by just perceiving in the natural father let it be something deep down inside let it be so God oh Father for we know that unconditional Covenant the coven of Grace Lord is upon us in this hour for it's for the Seed of Abraham you believe we are the Royal seed rise us up father from the dust of the Earth to the skies Lord that Seed of Abraham going from the Earth to the to the heavens first as the sand of the sea then as the stars of Heaven let us father rise up God from the dust to the to the star the sons of God in their position help us father for Lord we realize that you set all things in order and if one thing gets out of order Lord it would throw the whole universe into chaos but father it is remaining in its place where you first said it father help us Lord in this hour as we realize that our position in Christ his Heavenly places Lord we are gathered here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus bless us now Lord with all spiritual blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen God bless you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise love the Lord hallelujah good to us God bless each and everyone welcome in the presence of the Lord you want to open our Bibles in the book of St John 5 God bless you this morning day to serve the Lord know that he is the contr of all things amen you realize that need more of him less of us that's right our thinking less of our ideas less of what we want more of what he wants is that your desire this morning John 5 ver 24 scripture we taken for this subject that we touched on Wednesday and it's a continuation as the Lord is leading and showing us unfolding this these things that in the word of God I believe it is very fitting for the hour that we are living in and we also must realize that this has to be revealed to our hearts and it has to be something that we understand amen has to be by Revelation I believe this is why the holy spirit is uh leading us and continuing in this same line of thought that we can see as the word unfolds itself that it is something that it's deep in the word it goes from Genesis to Revelation there something that is Promised for us in this day so we have to take those promises for us amen by Revelation by faith believe that these things that we are hearing is for us it's not being given for any other reason but that we might understand this Revelation and walk in it by faith amen you want to read St John 5 verse 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life which is Zoe and shall not come into condemnation but is pass from Death unto life amen in first Timothy chapter 2 first Timothy chter 2se 5 there is one God one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus amen let's read that again for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus amen and in First Peter First Peter Chapter 3 Verse 18 first Peter 3 Verse 18 for Christ also have once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but Quicken by the spirit amen the Lord the blessings to the reading of his word amen you may be seated you want to continue on this subject and if we would open our spiritual ears this morning I believe we can receive something in our hearts that will help us to realize the the grace that we have in God to realize that we have this in our hands not only in our hands but it's here before us we have to recognize this this brother mam spoke to us about recognizing presence of God he also spoke to us about recognizing our day he also spoke to us about recognizing our message amen so it's not just words amen we say we have to realize you have to recognize this is something that is given to us that we might have that desire to understand to realize to recognize and that's that that is where we can receive from God if we hunger if we desire for those things to to be real to us but if if there's no entrance if there is uh no nothing that is available for us to access these things then we can become discouraged we can say well what what is the reason what's the purpose of me even trying but if we hear we see that these things are available it's accessible then we should have that desire in us to say this is possible this is for me amen I can I can as a Son of God I can enter into these promises say I'm living in the day where these things are made available to the church this wasn't made available in this measure in any other time last day right it was given in portions it was given uh to certain individuals it was given for certain purposes now in this last day is given in its fullness and it is given to the whole body of Christ if you're wondering what I'm speaking now what am I getting at is this same thing that we're that we've been speaking on the bridge back into Eden the second part to this message uh in the same line that we've been speaking of that third fold mystery of Christ amen which is the kingdom coming which is the kingdom of God being established in the heart of in in the heart of the Bride which is brother Bram said returning back into the Garden of Eden there's a spiritual fulfillment of that that it has to take and is taking place now amen amen it is something that is invisible that is taking place in this hour amen amen then brother bam shows us that that mystery that third fold mystery will be when Jesus Christ and his bride Revelation 19 come back to the Earth fight the battle of Armageddon and come into the Millennium to live a thousand years and Rule and Reign on Earth after this amen the Judgment then to come into the eth day amen amen because that day that was lost in Eden has to be lived again in its fullness upon the Earth but that that will be the literal part we're speaking about the spiritual part we're speaking about the part that is taking place now we're speaking and looking in the promises of God seeing where these things are being fulfilled now where these things are promised to us now and seeing how in our day amen these things were made available so now we we spoke uh Wednesday about this bridge we spoke about how brother Bram showed us that this bridge is Jesus Christ take us back into where man fell from amen this bridge is has been tested it has been built from Genesis to Revelation and it's every word of God it's Jesus Christ himself he is the word Amen brother ra said this bridge is nothing else but almighty God is that right amen we also seen how that Jesus Christ he could not die on the earth or he could not die in heaven he had to die in between because he was hung upon a cross brother bam said because he was the bridge Amen to bridge Heaven and Earth together amen amen that's why we've read the scriptures that we have read this morning we read the same scriptures on Wednesday St John 5 shows us that he that believeth on on me Jesus said amen and believeth on him that sent me heareth my words that's not just hearing with your natural ear amen that it is understanding brother said because to see and to hear to hear is to understand amen amen amen and then he says he has passed from Death life there's been a transition there's been a crossing over from from Death from the side of death into the side of life this is not just any life this is Zoe this is eternal life then Timothy in Paul in the Epistle of Timothy says that there is only one God Amen Hallelujah and there is only one mediator between God and men and that's the man Christ Jesus is that right Hallelujah so this is the bridge between God and man that connects God and man together he is the mediator he one in between right first Peter chter 3 says that he suffered In the Flesh he paid for the sins but he was quickened by the spirit to bring us back to God in other words we were alienated we were away from God separated from God but he was going to bring us back to God Amen when we look at that and we realize well you can say that that's very simple brother I I've accepted that I have accepted Jesus as my savior and I've seen the denominations how they put a chasm in the middle and they put the cross as the bridge to cross from one side to the other we're not talking about a denominational idea we're talking the word of the hour and this goes way more deeper than just a simple little thought and this is not about showing how deep we can go but this is to show us the access we have in this house there is an actual bridge that is here and it's before us another thing that the Lord showed us this Wednesday and I'm just refreshing this to us if you remember and we look at at the word how the Lord showed us there and we were reading the quotes in the scriptures how brother Bram shows us that this bridge amen it is not only to take us back into the presence of God not only to take us into the presence but it's also he said amen by the the blood of Jesus Christ puts us back in the position where we are supposed to be as sons of God and if you remember amen how the Holy Spirit spoke to us and we seen that that bridge it's not that you cross it once and say well I've already crossed it hallelujah praise the Lord and I don't have to cross it no more we must understand that we have to cross this bridge every day every day hear me every day we have to confess our sins amen if you're afraid to say sins God bless you because brother every time he would pray he' say forgive our sin you can get all Technical and say well don't sin and this and that amen it's just errors mistakes trespasses but brother bam said in the adoption message The Sinner doesn't sin did you know that adoption The Sinner doesn't sin Hallelujah he is a sinner he said if this Bible is black how how much of it is black just this much this much that's what he said he said it's all black yes amen am and a sinner can't sin because he's a sin all black but where it shows is where it's white that's where it shows you understand amen do we have to confess our sins daily do we have to put it under the blood daily do we have to Die daily amen am do we have to amen find a place in our lives that we are constantly using this bridge to keep us in a place where we are ready for whatever the situation might be if your sins are not under the blood if your sins are not confessed amen you cannot meet the challenge whatever it might be in your daily life you cannot you have no Authority you have no rights amen amen this is why brother mam said we have to realize that what we have been given is so powerful that it keeps us the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't lose its power it only gets stronger and stronger it only makes us hallelujah more clean more strong as the day go by we we have to realize that we have to Die daily we have to repent we have to confess because we are still in this body of Flesh and this is still has a sticky nature until this day comes that our bodies are changed is that right amen so you can try to play Angel with me but that's all right you try to play Angel but we know you're not an angel you're a human being amen amen but there's one thing that we do recognize and that's the blood of Jesus Christ brother bam said my whole makeup is Grace amen amen glory to God all of my makeup is Grace why because that's the only thing that will bring us out to the other side it's by the grace of Jesus Christ it's by the blood of the lamb but we have to to have this so impregnated in our hearts that it we walk in this Revelation it's something simple what brother bam said if it's so simple then how come it isn't working in the church how come we still have hard time when Trials come we don't know what to do you should know what to do perfect faith is a master of all circumstances you should be ready for when those things come but when those things come we find ourselves not ready we find ourselves going in in through through different situations or emotions and we begin to don't know what direction to take we begin to cry out to God but this is the hour where he says don't cry speak in other words you have to be ready you you have to know where you're standing amen because when those things are not confessed when you still have things lingering on you you cannot face the devil you cannot face sickness you cannot face any Temptation no sir you cannot no matter what you try to do you have to confess your sins it got to be under the blood because it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness amen that is the power of walking in that way that is the authority that you will live in because you know that the Bible says if we confess our sins he is faithful to forgive us and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us of all sin then now what else is it say what else does it say it says we fear amen amen when we pray that our prayer would be answered if our heart condemns us amen amen if our heart condemns us not then we have confidence to come before the Throne of God like Paul says in Hebrews boldly Before the Throne and ask what we have need but if our heart condemns us we don't have that access we don't have that that that that Liberty we feel condemn you might not confess it you might not say it but between you and God he knows and you know amen amen is that right so the thing is to have that that confidence boldness it's got to be under the blood then we can come before God and say Lord you know my situation father I speak it in the name of Jesus Christ is that right and then you can have true Faith amen you're not waiting for God to reply back and a rebuke to you to tell you okay yes but confess this get this right is that right you're not waiting for that amen you're not trying to hide you're not trying to put things under the rug and say oh yeah you know those things will take care for a SI whatever whatever but Lord I need this no you have to take care of those things you have to bring it out like David said even the secret things even the hidden things even the things I don't remember amen amen is that right amen this is the power of walking and living in this way it's something very simple amen but it can go a whole long ways if you if you apply it St John 15 verse 7 if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen amen you believe that Hallelujah is that a promise for you in the South now what are we speaking on the bridge back into Ed now notice in the message God in Simplicity 1963 Albert ker New Mexico he says the church today we are born sons of God Jesus himself said amen that if the the law called the prophets Gods whom the word of the Lord came to and the word of the Lord comes to the prophets if you call them Gods how will you condemn me that I say I'm the Son of God if the blood of bulls and goats could give power to Moses to go out there by the commission of God stretch forth his rod and say Let There come flies he had the word of God and he spoke that word it become from God's thoughts a word is a thought expressed so then when God thought it put it in Moses and then he spoke it it become a word and Moses turned around and went back and maybe there was not a fly in the country but in an hour from then maybe there was a one green fly and a half an hour there was 10 PBS per square yard what was it it was the creative power the word of God that was spoke by the lips of a moral man God uses man he could have used a son to preach the gospel he could have used the wind but he chose man to preach the gospel now what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong in my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing if God listen why is he saying there is something wrong in other words look at Moses under the blood of bus and goats bringing pharaoh and all Egypt and all this th this demonic force that was binding the children of God under bondage look at Moses under the blood of bulls and goats by the commission of God bringing this whole Kingdom Under subjection to the word of God and bringing Deliverance to his people by the word of God bringing things into existence for the purpose of Deliverance not for soul not for something like that for a Purp purp for deliverance to set the captives free isn't Jesus Christ to do the same work to you Hallelujah huj isn't the blood of Jesus Christ more powerful than the blood of bulls and goats then what's wrong with the church when these Powers come against us and we don't know how to bring them into subjection how to bring Deliverance to others not just to ourselves to others am am Hallelujah do you understand he says what's wrong with the church there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity if God could do by the blood of bulls and goats that only covered sin made a for iation for The Sinner but the sin was still there only covered over what can he do by the blood of his son that omit sin amen God has not manufactured but he has created a blood that takes away all sin and Mark 11 24 whatsoever you say to this mouth move in don't doubt your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you hi what you said where's the church at today you don't realize that confessed sin truly confess sin omit sinu listen to what he said listen to what he said and that confessed sin omit sin it builds a bridge across this Castle what does that do it builds a bridge across the castle what Castle the chm that was created when a man and God separated but this confessing our sin it builds a bridge Hallelujah to come back into the presence of his creator and makes him a Son of God he that believeth on me the works that I do shall be do also there you are if you say to this mountain be moved and no doubt in your heart it will come to pass glory to God it's my God revealing himself in humility notice God taking a humble sinner cleansing him by his blood dropping that confess sin into the Goro's breach of the Son of God putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then if we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost if we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost then what's wrong with us if Elijah dropped the RO on elishah and he got a double portion Jesus The Works that I do shall you do also and greater than this amen oh brother and in this day if you look at the life of Jesus amen look at his works you can to do that and greater not so much in in healing and deliverance and campaigns but the way he controlled amen the way he dealt with every situation do you understand the way he Lov the way he acted the way he was in harmony with the Father the same Harmony exist between Christ and his Hallelujah do nothing to do nothing on somebody you're not to do nothing except he shows you oh but I want to do this my family said I can do this I want to make plans amen you see you are to do nothing except he shows you hallelu is that how Jesus walked we're to do the same thing am sometimes we look at to be like Jesus is to go out here on L Lake and walk on it you know and heal people and discern the thoughts just look at how he was just look at his life brother said there wasn't a character never amen don't just look at the great things his life look at the Simplicity how he walked how he prayed he never said did you notice the disciples never never said teachers how to have Vision no they never said that they never said teach us how to preach teach us how to what how to PR Hallelujah why they knew something about Jesus's prayer you think the father answered the prayers of Jesus he said when that word abides in you it's like if Jesus is praying amen it's not you anymore it's him praying amen amen notice if we have to he says he say now you have called us be get off of my back get down to the Cross get to the gospel we don't have to imprison it why would you take an impersonation why would you take some false conception when the skies are full of the genuine Pentecostal power that makes a man or a woman a daughter A Son of God takes him back into the Pres pres of God there you are you've got to get away from your own thoughts you've got to let the mind that was in Christ be in you you've got to stay there until every sin of fear every sin of Doubt has gone from your heart if you're there God doesn't take you and omit your sins and send you into the presence of God there's something wrong with your experience I don't care how many degrees you have how much big church you are what kind of a big wheel you belong to many organization whatever it is has nothing to do with it until you confess your sins and they're in the blood of Jesus Christ you stand un adultery a born again son and daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it'll mind you amen God revealing himself in humility he picks up them kind that has no education he picks up them kind that just believe I thank thee father creator of heavens and earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent but has revealed it unto bab suches would learn now from now on I'm accepting God's humble message I'm going to believe it I'm going to stay there until my sins are gone I'm going to stay there until his holy spirit pours Into Me Faith for every word that's written he promised it to me if I've got that Chasm to cross see I need a bridge because his righteous blood then I can stand as a Son of God I believe the whole gospel I'm going to do it would you like to do that would you like to make that consecration raise up your hand amen if you like to make that consecration to cross back across this bridge into the presence of God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah you believe that now the people Pentecostal Methodist Baptist has these things if you've crossed that Chasm if you've crossed that Chasm until you know positive that you're standing in the presence of God a redeemed son and daughter of God not a make belief but a true genuine article the Holy Spirit Burns within you what you say to this mountain it moves you believe that if it doesn't now is your time amen hallelujah if it doesn't now is your time he's challenging amen you don't have to go out here look at these mountains look at these over here just look at the mountains in your life amen speak to the situation with faith you say brother I've done it doesn't work amen there's something wrong you have to put it under the blood if your sins are truly omitted you have a right to stand there in the face of the Devil Himself and say I call for this because it's the promise of God in the name of Jesus Christ and it has to be so amen do you understand it's not if ends or bus amen it shall be so amen look in the message Simplicity in Jeffersonville brother says when a man sin he's separated from God and cross the great C put himself in death on this side in death see but what does the scripture say you passed from Death until life he is put in death there's no way back God accepted a substitute a lamb a goat a sheep see but none of those things could cross them back across the C on that side he's a Son of God he's an offspring of God he's an inheritance to the Earth he have control of nature he can speak things into existence he's a Creator himself he's an offspring of God on that side of the bridge in the Garden of Eden he's a Creator he is in control of nature amen he is an inheritor to the Earth but when he crossed he separated see now he's under the hands of the Dominion of Satan but God took a sacrifice Hallelujah huj Glory see notice here what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father standing on the other side of the CM with no remembrance of sin against him there's no more stain Hallelujah he's free we've if when confessed sin is confess see a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symtoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lays upon him until the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into the Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged never to come into remembrance no more a man stands Justified as a Son of God God in Simplicity I want to ask you something if the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah hallelujah before it was bleached before this bleach come could could put a man in position to speak the creative word of God and bring flies into existence why would it stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ who could speak a squirrel into existence why would it why should it stumble somebody that the squirrel was spoken to existence brother if this Blood this Covenant Hallelujah of Jesus Christ amen the life of that blood animals have no soul they just body and spirit Hallelujah that's why the life of that blood could not come back upon the worshiper but the blood of Jesus Christ he is the very soul of God himself Hallelujah he is the soul of God Amen yes sir that life of that blood could not only cover sin that can come back into the believer Hallelujah cleans him from sin make him clean make him a Son of God because God became man so that so that man can become a Son of God hallelujah hallelujah he became man he was Ted in all man of sin Hallelujah but that life that was in him was God himself he was man but he was God he was a God man he was a god Prophet Hallelujah he was God but he was a man amen and that perfect amen mixture in him made the bridge for you and me to come back to God hallelujah bless be the name of the Lord because it was God in a man to make God in man come back together hallelujah amen now notice he says don't stumble over the Simplicity amen hallelujah this is very simple we know all that brother we know that we have to confess our sins it's simple right simple then how come it doesn't work amen amen he says brother said in my opinion we're not coming with the Hallelujah don't you do it he says don't stumble over Simplicity believe that he still remains God am in mark 11:22 if you say this not be mov don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said come to pass you can have what you said brother says I got three or four pages of that Hallelujah three or four Hallelujah says but we have to leave that you had a lot to say about you knew people would probably say yeah that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does it sets a man across the chasm this is in the fourth secret as a son God puts him back in the place that the creative power of God is huah at least whenever God can command it to be done amen did you hear what he Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ sets a man across the CM as a Son of God amen amen see and places it there the creative that the creative power of God is in him whenever God commands it to be done it'll be done am we get back to blot of bulls and goats when the pillar of fire in the burning bush he stood there on on a commission of God that God gave him he was a prophet when the word came to him he spoke and even things created by the word if he did that under the blood of bulls and goats what about the blood of Jesus not covered it but remitted it you stand in the presence of God as a son redeemed of God the church is far beyond its standard of living I think too many times we're probing instead of really coming out and feing the issue I've got something I want to say and I will after a while see he said the reason why is that we're just probing amen we're not really coming out and facing the issue why because when there are still things in your life that are not taken care of you can't come with that b you can't come with that with that Faith amen with that confidence is that right know there's something there doesn't let you amen but when those things are confess when those things are under the blood there's nothing that can hold you back and you have the confidence that you in communion with God hallelujah and you can stand there as a Son of God and say I I speak this I ask this I declare this in the name of Jesus Christ do you understand Church you understand what the Lord is trying to show us amen what is this bridge back into Eden amen hallelujah hallelujah it's the word it's walking in the light as he is in the light is that right and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin when when you walk in the light and what is the light it's the word of the hour in the blood of Jesus christes Hallelujah is that right is right yes sir what ises the Bible saying if we walk in the light as he is in the light then what what happens we just keep walking yes but there's something taking place the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us of all sin you see where the bridges at amen this ain't some denominational thing where somebody says oh I raise my hand I accept Jesus yes that's right but there's more than that you ain't crossing the bridge just by saying you believe in Jesus Christ no sir the Devils believe and they tremble and they ain't Crossing no Bridge brother you've crossed the bridge now let me draw it for you pretty little thing you've crossed now you you you have entrance to Heaven they're still on the other side they're still on that other side they haven't crossed nothing you see what I'm saying brother this bridge is the word of the hour amen amen hallelujah notice this is why we have to understand in the first seal brother Bram said the Bride of every age was sealed because she received all the light for her day I said they will raise at the resurrection I have something I want to get to in this in this message because God needs a bridge on the earth for the resurrection hallelujah amen hallelujah that's right and then we meet him in the air Lord he needs a bridge on the earth he needs a a living bre hallelujah hallelujah amen right but you notice the dead in Christ will rise but notice this brother bam said foolish hear me Hallelujah veral and questions and answers also he said the foolish virgin was actually not under the blood amen first he said she wasn't under the he said that's why she has to go through the tribulation amen she has to go through the tribulation for what what is the six seal what is the six seal anybody heard read what's the purpose what does it do purchas the Earth is that right purchase 144,000 purchase the foolish vir why does she have to be purged cuz she's not purged right now you understand you say oh it's simple brother the blood is simple it's so ABC always believe Christ that only the bride is under the blood amen that's ABC only the bride is under the blood amen you understand it goes It goes more than just just the thought brother bam said it goes deeper than what's on the line amen yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why he says the bride doesn't go through the tribulation why because he already paid for it at the prop she doesn't have to go through suffering and death and pain and tribulation because he already paid for it on the cross and she's under that you say then everybody else isn't in a in a way the foolish virgin amen she's a virgin she's pure because she lives a life see and the word sanctifies see but to be truly under the blood thism that we're talking about it's more than that amen now notice then this is why brother bam said the message fundamental foundation for faith faith now why why are we going to touch on this Faith right here because it has to be revealed and faith is a revelation you have to have faith in what God has given you to take and access and move in that walk in that let me read you something so you can understand in the message the presence of God unrecognized brother bam says in this day that we are living the the church amen is getting slothful the church is getting worldly the church is so indifferent amen amen and their minds are so muddled up amen amen with with all kinds of things right and some old things and staying home that shows where the people's hearts are now you can tell them things that are wrong and they'll they think you're crazy what is it it's the love of pleasure more than lovers of God the greatest pleasure that I know of is to be to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and I think that ought to be a thrill of the church a presence of the Holy Spirit seeing that God made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give faith it ought to make cripples walk the blind see the deaf hear the dumb speak I stood in South Africa where I had 2,000 people in the Duran trap R in and there I was explaining to them just in a mild form amen and they seen one thing take place and of that revealed 25,000 people was instantly healed when they seen that Revelation they taken seven van loads truck see 18 wheelers P full of old crutches heathens Hallelujah that didn't even know which was right from wrong right hand from Left Hand see why they recognized that the god of Heaven had appeared before them in the form of his word and we intellectual Americans just sit there they'll raise in the day of judgment and condemn this generation for what they've seen it reminds of a woman in Louisville Kentucky not long ago had a baby walking around in a tips store and she was doing little things trying to get this baby to notice it and the little baby just keep staring finally she picked up the bail anything to attract the attention of the little fellow and she shook the Bell and the little fellow just stared and she began to scream and fell over some of the people come to help her and she said oh no oh no it can't be it can't be what's the matter said the doctor said the baby was better she said what's the matter with with the baby lady it took a spell about six months ago it just sits and stars no matter what it is that ought to attract the attention of the baby it won't attract its attention all it does is just sitting stare the doctor told me it was better but I brought it down here to pick up little gadgets and ought to attract the attention of a child and it doesn't he just still sits and stars that's the way the church is getting God shook every promise before that's in the Bible before them and still they just sit and still and they say Show Me A Sign while while the presence of God is all around them it's in the place it to illuminate us when God let a promise and that promise is Vindicated when it comes by Revelation Jesus had the Messi sign but yet they wanted a sign yet they wanted something else but that was the very sh the word in him was the sign it wasn't in them to believe they just sat and stared they couldn't eyes where the presence of God was Hallelujah listen to this and when he is not recognized his power is not revealed am hallelujah amen amen that's true the preacher isn't bring the Revival the Revival is supposed to be in the people already supposed to be in your life supposed to be in your home supposed to be in you I ain't supposed to pump you up with the preaching oh you're supposed to pump me up Hallelujah I'm pulling on the word so that the word can flow amen maybe I'm not your preacher but it's still the word of godu oh yes I like that oh I like this but I don't like that it's all the word and it's for a purpose that we realize that this thing can't go on if we don't get in line with the word of God if we don't change our attitude amen hallelujah hallelujah oh my instead of trying to recognize his presence we want people to recognize us am oh recognize me I I I did this and I did that and I'm doing this and I'm doing this brother we to recognize what he is doing not what I'm doing not what you're doing what he is doing Hallelujah this is a this is an age when when anybody there anything they want people to see what they did I did this look at me I did that you see that's what I did that's what I did right there you see I did say Amen oh my someone put a someone put a screw in the in the hinge of the bathroom door I did it brother take me a picture I put the screw in there nobody knows me nobody acknowledges me nobody cares nobody sees you see what I'm saying we're to recognize him say when you do something do it for the glory of God Amen that's the reason why we have to recognize amen his presence not my presence not your presence when he is not recognized his power is not revealed when he is not recognized listen to this when he is not recognized no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you say then how come sometimes the services I just it's more power and I just feel it and then there's sometimes it's your faith it's Amen it's what you re because when you're hearing the word amen that's why continually amen amen the word has to be said in a certain way because people begin to to think and they begin to and begin to go and read reason things begin to move and that creates the atmosphere amen amen amen but when in people don't like instruction you ever notic that you ever notice that they don't like instruction instru when when there's got to be something done right we we have to do this let me give you the instructions how many read the instructions when you're going to do something you don't like instructions you buy something amen amen and it has a little instruction manual right it shows you how to build it I don't like the instructions and then you're over here you get mad you get frustrated read the instru right read the instructions is that right when it comes to instructions people think that this brother look at the word recognize his presence what are the instructions amen is it to show me who I am is it to show me how to walk how to be closer to God amen look at the reason why the instructions are being given don't just look at the fact that instructions are being given amen amen but I I've noticed especially when we get into teaching and different things that we have to teach that are in the message of God in the word to instruct us to show us how to walk in different things you have always noticed that that when instructions being given it's always harder the atmosphere is always harder it's a whole lot easier when it's just preaching amen you're preaching you're preaching said it's a different anointing but when instruction is being given it's harder it's harder to pay attention it's harder to receive because we don't like instruction amen hallelujah amen and that's the thing we we we we have to have enough maturity to understand amen that these things that God does is to show us instructors and it's our attitude it's our faith is the fact that we realize and recognize that that's the presence of God when the greats came to Jesus he says show us the sign brother he was the sign in he fles the word in him was the sign amall we want to see something what's going on where's the sign at I'm the sign Jesus said I'm the sign amen why because the word was in him and what's the secret what did Brother say the word is in the Hallelujah that's the secret am you understand now notice then he says he says he gives an example he says it's like a woman with the blood issue all them people passing by all of them stand standing up and and and there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims he's a prophet he's a fanatic but what happened the little woman with the blood issue she had heard about it and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if I can only touch His Garment and when genuine faith in God become a positive thing to her what did it do it released the power to heal that was in Jesus amenu brother said sometimes God used the gift amen amen is that right amen sometimes God would use the gift in Jesus J he said then sometimes the people would pull it out because they would see there's something in there that I can benefit from God through this channel you understand look at this brother this is powerful he says now he said when that be that faith become positive in her it released his power in him to heal her and he said who touched me he turned around and told her what was wrong with her your faith has saved you what did it Faith others standing there might have been sicker but you see she recognized his presence he know she know that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose to release our desire that we have in him to us but we've got to rec his presence and narrow how to recognize his presence is when the promise word for this age is made manifest the promised word for any other age is the promise of the word for this age hallelujah how recognize his presence when that word of the age is made manifest what is Manifest what does the word manifest mean made flesh Hallelujah the word being made flesh is what you have to recognize the say about the word stay on paper this ain't about the word staying in the bible let me tell you right now that God ain't going to Rapture this God ain't going to take this in the Rapture God ain't going to take this in the Rapture God ain't going to take that in the rap he ain't going to take this in the rap he ain't going to take this in the rap amen what is he taking in the r the word in you he said I will come and pick myself up Hallelujah the word why do we have this why do we have this why do we have this why do we have that amen so that the word can come in here that's why because the time is coming where you won't be able to look at the table you won't be able to look at quotes you won't be able to read this you need the word in you to speak word in the time of trouble you won't have the Liberty Amen to read message books and and print out quotes whatever is in you that's what the message is God ain't rapturing no paper he ain't rapturing no Bible he's rapturing his people got hallelujah hallelujah that's what he's rapturing that's what he's taking because he's coming for his word who is he coming for he's coming for his word and his word is in hisu that great magnet comes by it has to pull of its own nature Hallelujah the great magnet of God comes one of these days it's the word it's a word magnet and it has to pull the word hallelujah Glory Hallelujah and you say but brother this is the word this is the word he ain't magnetizing that that's going to stay here but the word you it's what is magnetized bless be is why we have to recognize that the presence of God is in our midst when when the word is made flesh that's his presence that's the living reality of the word of God there ain't how many signs we can do there ain't how many things we can do or manufacture it's the word in you that's the abiding presence that stay there you're not just an anointed one of the end time no you're the Hallelujah glory amen I don't just walk the anointing I don't just walk this word right here and I only know it because I read it and I only know it I say come here come here look what it says right here I want it inside here the only way to get it off your hand is to get it in your heart Hallelujah you have it in your hands or do you have it in your heart where do you have it at you have it in your mind said the blood is on your head and the only way to take the blood off of your hands they can't wash it off they can't pray it off they got to get the thing in your soul way that's the only way to get it off your hands there a word in our hands is it just in our hands Allelujah the blood is got to come into our heart is that right we have to recognize his presence if we could only realize that he is in these meetings for one purpose to release our desires that we have in him but we've got to recognize his presence how do you recognize it when his promised word for this age is made manifest not the promise word for Moses age or any other Age The Promised word for this age let me say that again that's analing statement where he is not recognized his power is not revealed Hallelujah where he is not recognized his power is not recognized is not revealed notice the message who he said Revelation is Sovereign am amen Lord Revelation isign Hallelujah he gives it to who he will amen amen notice this it's not him that willth him that runneth but God his predestination he could choose before any time God is Sovereign in his choosing do you know that God is Sovereign who was back there to tell him a better way to make the world to tell him that he's running his business wrong the very word itself is Sovereign even the Revelation is sov he reveals to whom he will reveal the very Revelation itself is Sovereign in God that's how people bound at things and jump at things and hit on things not knowing what they're doing in other words they want to get something out of God so they try this and they try that and they try this and nothing works the only way brother that that bridge is open to you is by Revelation it's not how much you try Is What You Do by Revelation that's what counts and Revelation is that's why brother Bram said in the token message Lord let me have it right here let me speak what's revealed to me hallelujah it's the token that's the required I can only speak what the token is I can only speak the truth what's inside I can only speak what I see what I hear what's revealed to me that's what I speak so if it's not a revelation it's not sovereignly given to you then you can't speak it you can quote it you can refer to it but to speak it as that word in you to come to pass it can't be done because it's not in you see but when it's revealed to you you that gate gives you the access that opens that that channel that wave so that that word or that whatever promise can come and pass see am now notice this this is why brother BR said a fundamental foundation for Faith he said faith is an unconscious thing amen real Faith you're unconscious Hallelujah you don't know that faith that you've got amen you're not conscious of it hallelujah hallelujah conscience man could you imagine Jesus questioning whether he had Faith or not to stop the winds amen did Jesus have to do something extra to to to to grow and get stronger in order that he could speak to the winds that's how we think sometimes we think that we can't do it now but you know as we grow we'll come to the place where we can do it amen but it's already there it's unconscious if you've got the Holy Ghost and the blood's been applied to your soul and the life of that blood has puten you inside by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost only those that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost will go in the Rapture Hallelujah you say amen amen hallelujah amen no one else is going amen now there's there's teachings manmade ideas where they try to twist the things brother Bram said to make it seem that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not go in the Rapture and then they even go as far to say that the foolish virgin had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they didn't have their Doctrine so because they didn't have their Doctrine they can't go in the rap they don't say that like I said but that's the way they teach but brother bam very plain very clear only the seed of God Only The predestinated Seed of God be reborn Hallelujah only the bride he never said anything about anything else having it and then not going and this and you need some kind of creed that only goes filled with this Holy Ghost we go in that am you understand now notice when that is in you brother it's already in you it's in it's unconscious Jesus never stopped to question whether he had Faith to stop the winds to steal the waves or have enough Faith to raise up Lazarus he never questioned his faith the first thing before we can have faith we've got to have some foundation for Faith that's start to be something behind it when um when man when he chooses his life's companion he usually requires of her life and so forth inquires about her life and what her family what her background is we have to have something to have a basis and you ask her only thing you can take is her word that's all he can take all that she can take from him is his word I'm so glad that God has placed it in that way a man taking his wife us taking Christ as the bridegroom him taking us as the bride we just have to base it upon the what are we anyhow did you ever think about those things along those lines what are we here for we are human beings what made us human beings what made us different from everything else in the world as human beings no matter what state a man's in he's yet a Son of God no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he's still a fallen son God is his Creator God is his maker God has brought bought him with the price that he has never reconciled himself to that he may never accept it he may never do it it may never do him any good but yet God did it for him and he's a son and a daughter of God what God put man here for we could spend much time on these thoughts but just to give a a a basic thought God when he made man in the beginning he made him Superior to anything on the earth he gave him jurisdiction to everything on the earth to control everything he controlled the fouls and the fishes and the winds and the plants man was made a secondary God he was given power to control the elements amen Adam was given these great Powers but when the power that he was given to make himself in other words to make more like him Hallelujah when he was given the power to make himself is where he fell Adam could speak to the winds he could stop he could speak to the trees they obey him he could speak to the wildli he could speak to the waters everything obey Adam in the beginning of man see that's what God gave him power over though through the fall through the fall he lost that power and he becomes unconscience of the fact that after losing his relationship and his friendship and fellowship with the father amen he lost that and all of his great channels had become clogged up he couldn't get through that Adam was in God but what Adam was in God Christ Christ has redeemed us back to that back to that same condition a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring back to its original again Adam never had to be sick Hallelujah he never had to die he never had to worry he never had to have a headache he never had to fear he just climb up in the arms of the father like a child everything was his whatever he asked for he got everything obeyed him he was God's child and a child is the heir of all things but when man fell he lost this and what he lost Christ as a redeemer did you ever stop and think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back he brought us back to God to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God He restored back all that Autumn lost and since he has restored man to his place man in the fall lost the consciousness of what the father put him on Earth to do his faith all his things have been clogged up now notice he says if Satan can make his power work make his laws work in a in the human body in the human life see by Satan by his laws sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought operate to Satan is that right when he sends something man recognizes how many recognize this a head all the time all the time when you see your child getting sick do you recognize she's getting sick oh yeah hello somebody yes when you're getting sick do you recognize you're getting sick when you feel PID do you recognize I feel pain but he sends doubt and fear you recognize that presence that feeling amen if Satan by his laws can he he says sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought operate to Satan he sends cancer and man recognizes it and receives it Satan sins headaches we recognize it and receive what are we talking about wherever God is not recognized wherever his presence is not recognized his power is not revealed I can preach for five hours it won't do you any good until you recognize who's in our mid amen amen amen see Satan sends headaches we recognize it and we receive it if Satan by his power can make his laws work in a man how much more up god with his power make his laws work in a man amen amen if Satan can make his laws and we're sure and recognize oh yeah I know this is a headache you can't tell me I don't got a headache I know what a headache is I had a lot of them and I know what it is I reckon a amen see how much more the children of God ought to make his laws be recognized among his people Divine Healing Revelation power givs manifestations of the spirit the law of sin and death works in the people but the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free what is brother man talking about since Adam fell in the Garden of Eden we have lost it the Consciousness but Christ has redeemed us back that bridge brings us back into that presence to bring it from the soul to your understanding that's where Revelation comes in Revelation is in the soul It Doesn't Remind nowhere else but from there it has to come to your spirit from there it has to come to your body from there is where your healing comes from there is where Revelation flows from there is where the power of Resurrection is amen that's where it is it ain't coming from somewhere else the Resurrection the change of your body is already inside of you but there's a law is see what he said we have to recognize the laws of God Amen are laws that we recognize and at a certain time at a certain fulfillment at a certain Junction that has to be in there but we have to be conscience of that we have to walk in that that's why he said if my word abide in you and and you abide in me ask what you will it shall be given to you why because his word is abiding in you you're walking in that you're conscience of that so when the time comes and you need it you can ask Hallelujah am you don't need to question and see whether you have faith do I have faith to do this can I stop this story can I heal this cancer can I do this can I do that you're walking in the word abiding in the word you know your sins are confessed you don't have to question your heart doesn't condemn you Hallelujah you're sure amen that you're abiding in the word and the word is abiding in you you can ask what you will hallelujah amen is that right yes sir he says everything that God spoke in his word if it is received through the right channel it will materialize his word whatever the promise is behind it God will do it he's obl am hallelujah look at in the ever presentent water from The Rock he says brothers and sisters I want to ask you something if we are born again if we are by the spirit of God God born again God don't have little weak parts or strong Parts he's all together God if you have enough of God in you to just barely barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system because it's God it's strong it's all strong and right now in every believer in here that has eternal life see youve passed from Death that's the bridge that's the bridge in you that have eternal life which is God's spirit in you you have enough power that will raise up the dead heal the sick till sets orbits in condition but it's controlled by a law that Spirit that's in you your sons and daughters of God the same spirit that you've got in you listen The Same Spirit that you've got in you will raise yourself up at the day of the resur raise yourself up didn't Jesus say I have power to lay my life down I have power to raise myself back Hallelujah power the spirit of God in you will raise yourself up at the day of the Resurrection when we die our souls go under the altar of God where where I was privileged to to to see amen where the Bible speaks of our Spirits our bodies return to the dust of the Earth but someday where the scriptures fulfilled our spirits will be released from God we will pick up the soul the body the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the res if there wasn't a law to the Sons and Daughters of God we would create a world out here and go live a private life on that new world Amen he said you have the power amen amen you have the power to do it amen you've got to if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you God is omnipotent see what I mean you can speak a world into existence and go live on now listen that that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law amen am and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments amen amen amen I've heard Brothers quot this book it says controlled by a law in other words then they go on and teaching it and then they say the law is that all this has to happen for that to happen in you in other words their Doctrine has to come to pass in order for you to have that power work through you our Doctrine has to come to pass first that's our law then this power can work you unless our Doctrine isn't fulfilled yet you can't do it amen amen but listen to what brother vam say is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of Faith am the law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible for them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe it's yours whatever he can reveal to your soul that you believe that's possible it's your every place that the soul of your feet steps upon by faith God gives it to you it's your possession you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith it opens it to you you see what I mean is controlled by if you're a son of daughter daughter of God that power never leaves you hallelu with you all the time but your faith gets away from that but the power still when you're saved God gives you Faith to rise above the muck of the Earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith is that act that God has did in you to make you a Son of God you quit you're lying have you you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith Rises up above it if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith you're saved through Grace and as much as your faith will be released amen as much faith will be released from you that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God will in you there you are but it's your faith Jesus would say according to your faith be it unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible say to this mountain be moved and be moved don't doubt but believe what you've said you can have what you said then kind of people what kind of people ought we to be having faith in this Christ that has redeemed our lives he is the smitten rock that never leaves the church I'm with you always always to the end of the world he's ever present Hallelujah he's the great Rock always present and the waters to give forth but you've got to speak to the rock hallelujah Hallelujah notice this here we are the trouble with the church today is we've got we can conquer every disease we've got the power in us we we are Sons and Daughters of God nothing can stand before us not even cancer but the only thing is he wants us he wants to find somebody who will believe it who will believe that God's already done it for you not we will be we are now the ever living presence of the spirit of God is within us hallelujah that's the problem we've got to believe that's the reason walking before sick people hallelujah hallelujah that's how them Visions happen God can't lie you've got to believe it you there got to be something there to open open it to you and let you in on it what we need today listening what we need today is not pray for more power you've got enough power to make new Earth what you need to pray for what you need what you need is Faith to use that power you need what you need is to control that life and live such a Godly life when you ask God anything you have confidence in God we know if we keep his Commandments he'll withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him God walking with us is that right we need amen more faith Hallelujah we need to ask God for more faith of that power that already in us he has redeemed us back to that place that Adam fell from but we come we we we become unconscious of the fact amen but we when we realize when we recognize that the presence of God is already here that door is open for us that bridge is here before us the presence of God is here then we can use that access for the glory of God we can use that access amen for whatever the situation is hallelujah if you need Joy it's already in you if you need peace it's already in you the resurrection you're worried how it's going to happen you're worried you need to receive some new doctrine to know how it's going to happen it's already in you you you you need to you need to know how the Rapture is going to be amen that power of God in you it's the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken your moral body Hallelujah hu that's the power of God that gives us all things through Jesus Christ that's what we need friends what do come to do he says in the future home not aai come a restoration back to the first day Hallelujah to restore the hearts of the children a restoration back to the beginning hallelujah hallelujah we will will manifest the evening light the same light that shine in the beginning is the same light when God said let there be light and there was light that was the manifestation of what he spoke hallelujah hallelujah the reason why Satan was able to come into the burden of Eden and Destroy God's plan you know why because that word wasn't in the heart of Eve I'm going read you something brother bam said you can have the spoken word and Satan will still Knock You Down you can have the written word it'll still knock you down the words got to be made flesh amen and he said that's what happened in Eden they had the word they even had the spoken word but how come Satan was able toquer brother ra said the Holy Spirit here the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed that they had they had the SE what's a SE spoken word is the Original Seed you can have the seed it'll never produce you can have the seed with in your hand all day brother you know right here you know in this SE right here oh there's 50,000 million trees in the seat right here it it can feed a lot of people in the seat right here you can make fruit salads in the seat right here there's enough power to fill all the all all the the the produce stores in San Diego produce amen amen is that right Amen in this seat right here there's enough power to fill a semi full of oranges is that true amen he's not lying it's truth but it do good just to talk about amen is that right you have the seat all day right here your hand this is the seat this is the seat we can look at it we can read it we can quote it we can talk about it we can imagine the faith imagination Hallelujah is certainty faith is what a until you plant it until the Holy Spirit Waters that seed Hallelujah then it's going to produce amen see the Holy Spirit was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed man wasn't going to die man was made to live hallelujah hallelujah there's a reason why we're constantly dying there's a germ of life come from the real seed that's God provided and in his seat he rose up again that through that life going over the Original Seed like it was given to Eve over his real church it's bringing forth life through the birth through the womb of his bride am that's what the holy spirit is here for the Holy Spirit was in the Garden of Eden how come Satan was able Amen to do what he did there is that right amen and overcome them and break break them down the way he did and take them away from their position and take away that power that Adam had amen bring them out of that fellowship with God why because brother the word hadn't been made flesh yet you understand but when that word is made flesh Hallelujah huj you understand that that faith is given to you Hallelujah that re is given to you to to to to to move in the power amen that is in you already hallelujah hallelujah all these things that are given to the church brother is for the glory and the benefit of the kingom but what is the secret the secret is the the real believing Church brother Adam said her secret is the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah that's the secret the life of God in you what's the secret the word is in the bride and here he says the secret to the real believing church is the baptism of the Holy Ghost whether you can't have the word in you without the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you got baptism of the Holy Ghost you got the word in you amen cuz we're not stuffing fols into you amen you don't got have to have some surgery to put a message book inside of you amen hallelujah the word is in the bride the only way the word can abide do we read s John 15 verse the word if the word abides in you amen amen my words abide in you you abide in me ask what you how where does the word bu where can it stay and never leave only in your heart if it's in your mind could be there for for for Sunday maybe Monday Tuesday a trial comes children get you mad wife makes you mad amen and you forget about I'm just speaking real life amen that's the thing but if it abides then we understand that we have to use Faith now to to operate what we have that's what brother Brandon was telling the Pentecostal he said it's good it's good praise God shout you know sing dance good he said but keep some power in you to move in the word don't leave it all here in service keep some in you amen to walk and move in the power of God faith in what God has giving you faith in what's inside of you oh God I need I need more power I need more power to overcome you need Faith to overcome power already in you but how is it going to be released as you surrender amen as you allowing God to move in you and just believe that his promised word hallelujah walk in that brother Adam said you have to walk out in faith because works is Faith expressed is that right that's right if that faith is in you amen then it's got to come into action he's got to move like David he had faith in him but brother said then the works began to manifest as he went down into the valley to face the giant his Works were expressing the faith that was in him hallelujah amen hallelujah what if he what if he say I got faith I got faith I got faith and then he he's hiding from the Giant I got faith I can kill the giant I can kill the giant amen you see that faith is not showing Amen in his life but until it's manifest after until it comes out that Faith that's in them is expressed amen through his works and he kills that then it shows he really had hallelujah hallelujah see is is not to say how much power we have it's how much Faith perfect strength by Perfect weakness This Might Sting a little you think you have to have a nice preacher the word tuxedo suits and say Amen so beautiful to be a prince that's a woman's puppet God wants men God men men that can shake but we want something desirable we want something that can speak intellectually that can let us sleep for five minutes while he's preaching on Sunday morning I want separators say Amen who will send forth like a bra blaze of lightning amen condemn sin to the roots and dig the root but we want intellectual pastors most of the people want a whis we want a whispering Pastor God wants thunderbat yes sir them on the back tell them it's okay wear short hair and make makeup everything else wearing clothes that looks like they were poured into it and don't say a word about amen amen back then it was it was for the women you know clothes now it's little 65 boys amen amen P so tight they can't even walk female Amen brother talked about those those thingss Amen brother BR said look at him the churches today he says amen he says a singer in the church amen bangs hanging across his foreheads listen to he said that's not a son of God that's a son of Satan mhm amen yeah B you know shorter and shorter shorter here but long in Long Amen to clo what's this modern stuff amen don't come out of the pits of hell you understand we when we realize brother that those things so simple amen amen but yet if it's not under the blood that cleansing power it's not moving in US amen that's what's holding the thing back that's why we can't overcome that's the reason why because we let our secret out amen amen gave away our secret amen but that's where the power is amen amen it's in that secret it's in the baptism of the Holy G that's how the word gets in you but when you give that away oh you know that's good but you want something else you get away from that you let that secret out oh my I have a bunch of goats instead of lambs amen let down the bars amen let down the bars the goats get in is that right amen and notice he says a great man called me into the office to his office his field office here not long ago he said I want to lay hands on you that you'll stop that I said don't you do it no sir when you stop that you stop the message Hallelujah did you hear that when you stop what when you stop preaching against that when you stop that you stop the message you stop God when you do that yes sir we want we don't want none of that amen amen oh but it's okay you know all right sooner or later in the message look brother says the bridge a way across there the blood of sheeps and goat could make a creative the word of God created by the by the mouth of a man amen says people today try to say that those words was for another age if you're still out you're still out from under the blood if you're under the blood the power of God by his word Still Remains the Same it's got to be the same but if you're not under the blood you can say those kind of things amen amen oh man Hallelujah he says notice we must coope our lives in focus it to the word of God just like we would take a picture camera and focus it right before we snap the picture then we get a real true picture see that's what we have to do focus our lives into Jesus Christ and Christ and you become the same person then you're a son adopted by God the blood of his righteousness the church will be moving on it will be moving without friction without hurt without harm without doubts without Scruples amen without fr it would be moving in the power of the word of God manifesting Divine blessings if it just did that we must do our lives we must see him and him only amen we must look to Jesus Christ Hallelujah hallu this is why bam said it's been the same in every time when you separate yourself from anything then it's just you and God hallelujah it's what you do with God you as an individual look what God gave the men and the people Through the Ages hallelujah hallelujah look at Abraham look at Zariah look at Moses look at Noah look at Elijah they got alone with God just him and God hallelujah HJ look what that does what did it happen it happened in the minority always in the minority amen one child you see where I'm going one child that's all it took that's right God just needs one man that's all he needs somewhere where he can have a Voice Hallelujah somewhere where he can have a voice that's all he wants just to get one man in his control how he loves to get one man he got Noah one time he got Moses one time he got Jeremiah Elijah and Elisha he got John he got a Samson as long as he can get one man in his control that man is his voice hallelujah hallelujah he can speak through him and condemn the world how he hungers and he looks to get a man in his control that I can speak to him and let my voice be known through him it will be my voice Hallelujah hu when you surrender in the hands of God Amen to have him control of you that becomes his Voice Hallelujah huj one is the majority with God hallelujah no matter how much minority might CH the majority with God Amen is one person surrender in the hands of Almighty glory amen and in that form one is the majority with God because we are not looking at the things that are see visibly we are looking at the things invisibly by faith in the word of God we look to the promise and that promise is true it's yay it's Amen Hallelujah they cannot fail and we've got the power in US already to bring it to pass but the faith is what's lacking many times to believe that it can be so Hallelujah but if our hearts are not in condemnation if we are under the blood we can have that faith we can have that confidence we can have that assur and know amen that I'm not doing it to be shown to be seen amen I'm doing it for the glory of God I'm doing it because I'm in the line of his word of his commission am and when he ORD it when he says to be done it shall be done hallelujah hallelujah that spirit of God inside of you is there all the time amen but the only thing that you have to have the fa and the Revelation to recognize where his presence is we're looking for his presence we want to come and say I wonder if his presence is here or maybe it's over there or maybe it's in this or that where is his presence Hallelujah his presence is in the promise word for the age and that word must be inside of the heart the believer to realize that's where presence is everything else is in the glory has departed but there's only one place where his word is where his glory is hallelujah his presence is and that's in the heart of the believer in the heart of the Bride in this show so if you are the porter of of the glory of God if you are the carrier of his presence why look for his presence somewhere else when it's inside of you so if you recognize the presence his power will be revealed amen hallelujah because where his presence is not recognized his power is not amen am amen hallelujah oh my oh my amen mark 11:24 whatever you desire ask it whatever it is pray and believe it you'll receive it now present T it shall be given to you you can have it if you'll believe it when you ask it it's not I ask it and then it it's going to come later Jesus said believe that you receive when you ask it's present tense then you can have what you ask because quickly before the father he goes to work why because he makes intercession upon your confession he intercedes for our sins when we confess see how it's an important part that blood that builds the bridge hallelujah hallelujah notice he goes to work to make intercession Upon Our confession and that settles it that's the reason people are being healed in the meeting it doesn't take a special evangelist to come through it just takes your faith in all sufficient Christ and the omnipotence and the omnes Christ who is everywhere anywhere that you'll call upon him he's there to meet the conditions he's a very he he's very present help in the time of trouble hallelujah hallelujah he's a help in the time of trouble is that right what did the word say he hide me in his Pavilion in the time of trouble you have to be in there in Christ the time of trouble notice now as we close here Jesus told Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven notice the spiritual Revelation not by word not by denomination not by Creed not by anything else but the spiritual Revelation listen now you might believe in your mind but when you believe in your heart you got eternal life John 524 he that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me have Zoe God's own life Immortal Life why because you believed on him you have accepted him as your personal savior the blood has cleansed you the spirit has filled you not by intellectual but by a birth how God has brought it down and revealed it to you by spiritual Revelation you see Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word but you see that faith is not the very thing because faith is the purchasing power to buy or get what you have need of it's like if I'm starving to death and I have 25 cents and the loaf of bread cost 25 cents I can rejoice and I can have the assurance that I've have the 25 cents I'm starving to death but I can Rejoice amen that I already have the loaf of bread now because I have the 25 cents in my pocket I can rejoice as much over the 25 cents as I could over the loaf of bread but yet the 25 cents is not the loaf of bread you understand it is the purchasing power so the faith is not the very thing it's what you need to release the power Hallelujah huj you have to recognize that presence and then have faith in that presence faith in the power faith in the blood faith that the Holy Ghost is in you that's where a lot of Doubt comes whether you have it or not amen whether you really are filled with the Holy Ghost or not amen that's where the battle is because Satan comes tells you you ain't got nothing then you hear a preacher preach and he touches certain things that are in the word and they hurt and you know that you've made a few mistakes in those areas amen you feel condemned and you say oh maybe I don't have it thank you Lord come on brother that's where the battle is Amen to see that you have faith in the power that's in you to have faith in the experience that you have with God and the only way you can have faith in that is know that it's in the word brother bam said the only way I know if my experience is real if I check it with the word my experience it's in the word I can have faith in that experience Hallelujah not just because I felt a chw at my spine or my my hair stood up amen not just because of that but take it back to the word and know that my experience I died hallelujah amen and he come in me and since that experience that I had I've never been the same no more my life changed Chang amen that's right hallelujah amen that's why that doubt and that fear is constantly battling us it's not to see whether the word is right it's not whether to see amen if there's going to be a Rapture if there is a bride if there was a prophet that's not the battle the battle is to see if that word's going to work in you and if you really got the Holy Ghost if you really have what it takes amen that's what it is but when you recognize where his presence is it releases the power of God his power will be revealed amen amen see now notice notice what brother said you you you can have sometimes remember how we were seeing how it's unconscious something in us we have it but yet many times in our in our mind in our conscience in our reasoning in our memory in our affection because of the battle that we're in in our mind in our mind listen in our mind we don't see it we don't understand amen amen in our mind we doubt in our mind we we see that that that we don't have what it takes you see this is why it cannot be depending of on what we hear as to tell us for being judged by the word that we are hearing no no we have to be judged by what's in us as we hear the word there's a difference because if if you don't have that I hope you understand if you don't have that every time you hear another preacher you're going to say okay I need now what he's saying amen and then you hear another preacher you say no I need what he's saying amen do you hear another tape Amen on one tape amen narrow as a way straight as a gate you see oh my only 12 of that generation oh God then you hear another tape it says you are the perfect sinless spotless amen then you hear another tape says works his face expressed amen you begin to you begin to think begin reason all those Works manifest in me so you see the way you judge amen if that word is in you is by when that word word is coming forth amen not whether in your mind you reason it and you begin to see if it fits to your life or not amen that's what we that that's where we lose a lot of ground many times because we're hearing the word we're hearing a certain part of the word and and then we we we begin to judge now the experience we have with God through that word that we're hearing see what I'm saying amen okay amen amen all right I say that because it's true I know I know we all experienc amenu you can go on all your life hear and all the preachers you want in the world including me and you will always feel that way amen because the word are you listening to me the word is a sharp sword sharp amen amen it doesn't just go like this and just just stay on one little thought and say okay that's nice that little thought is a discerner to keep us in line brother B said the reason why the reason why I say like it was in the days of Noah only eight Souls says the reason I speak that way how many will leave in this he says the reason I preach like that he says to keep the people in line he says I'm not telling you that you're going to you're out he says but if we make it to a place where we say okay everybody's everybody's going in he says then you get lazy then you get relaxed then you just say praise God I'm you see what I'm saying it becomes boring it becomes lazy he says the reason we preach that way we tighten and we hit this and we hit that for you to stay in that's good brother yes sir amen not trying to un christianize you amen today you're out of the blood Next Day You're In The Blood next week you're bride going in the Rapture and then this week you're not going in the Rapture because you're not fulfilling these things see doesn't make sense you've got to know what's in here but next week it will probably be another message of you know you see your name in the book you're going in the Rapture come on is that true yes that's true I can quote you another quote who is this MC if youve had the Holy Ghost in you he said that's the that that that's the evidence that's the earnest that you're going in the r you see but brother these these things that we're looking at instru is to let us know how that we can become more efficient in this battle that we're fighting more powerful powerful church now listen to listen to this quote and and and take in mind what what I was telling you right now I'm closing right here he says now he says he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have eternal life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life listen because he's believed on the Son of God now the scripture says no one can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost yet even the Pope says he's the Christ but he ain't got the Holy Ghost it has to be spoken by Revelation it's about to be revealed into you now listen someone else raises up now you may have intellectual Faith you may believe it listen you believe it because the word says from the standpoint of the word amen see the word is right word is right but the thing is whether it's in you you believe it from the standpoint of the word but in your heart in your soul has the Holy Spirit ever called you to that place no matter what your mind says no matter what your mind says something in your soul believes whether your mind can go crazy amen just like when brother bam said he was praying to God amen about his daughter Sharon Rose Sharon Rose he says he clothes a black C wouldn't hear my prayer amen amen then Satan came said look at your dad amen look at this look at that now he he he he throws his curtain down on you doesn't hear doesn't love you the B said everything Satan was saying everything he was saying true no matter what your mind says something in your soul Hallelujah believes then you're not outside of God outside of Christ they alienated from God they trespasses a sinner bound towards H if that word ain't in your soul that you can believe it amen Holy Spirit no matter what your mind says in your soul you believe it if you're not there then you're outside of God you're in sins and TR trespasses a sinner bound towards stand to your feet amen hallelujah that's why the word has only one place where it can rest it only has one place where he can abide it's not in a message book it's not on paper it's not in the Bible amen amen no matter how much David put scriptures all over his house he didn't have it in his heart didn't David say I put it on my door on my door post amen put it in the entry way put it in my walls David said put the word amen amen put the word everywhere one moment seeing a beautiful woman bathing was enough amen no matter how much scriptures were on the wall he needed it here hallelujah yes sir the word is right nothing wrong with the word put it on your wall put it in you know it's fine I'm not against that you see what I'm saying amen that's good pictures we're not against that here in church but the thing is it's got to be in you understand yeah the word has to hid in you you say well what does that have to do with the bridge back to even you have to do all of that if you caught the line of the spirit this morning that's exactly what it's for and and and the beautiful thing about it is you're part of it Hallelujah you have that access it's it's right before you amen it's for you
