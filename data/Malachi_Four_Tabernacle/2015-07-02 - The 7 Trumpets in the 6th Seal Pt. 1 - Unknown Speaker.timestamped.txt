[0:01] in a supernatural
[0:03] form but it is a lean
[0:06] spirit that would want somebody
[0:10] else get the
[0:12] Revelation and wait for it to come in
[0:15] the
[0:16] future because they're too lazy for
[0:21] themselves to search in the
[0:23] message and see what really is already
[0:28] revealed it all comes down to
[0:30] that brother Ram said in Feast of the
[0:34] trumpets that the bride in order to know
[0:38] her
[0:39] husband must be constantly in the word
[0:41] of
[0:42] God amenu and if you caught the reason
[0:48] why the Holy
[0:50] Spirit has been exhorting the
[0:53] church and the last
[0:56] messages that we have been bringing
[1:00] it has all been in the same line of
[1:03] thought because of the condition that we
[1:07] see in the local
[1:09] church amenu and we see
[1:12] then that these different
[1:16] things is to put us in line with the
[1:18] word of
[1:20] God amen amen this is the reason
[1:25] why that when entering to this
[1:28] subject I wanted to give a little
[1:32] introduction I wanted to give you the
[1:35] purpose behind why we're entering into
[1:38] this
[1:40] subject and that you might begin to
[1:44] understand and
[1:46] see that we're not just getting into the
[1:49] subject just to know what it
[1:51] is there is a purpose behind it
[1:55] amen and brother brandham
[1:58] said in the
[2:01] introduction to the seven Church
[2:05] Ages which is in the
[2:08] exposition he is speaking of the
[2:12] reason or the introduction of why it's
[2:17] necessary to
[2:20] study and detailed study of the seven
[2:24] Church
[2:25] ages is
[2:27] necessary Amen in order to
[2:30] study and understand the rest of the
[2:35] Revelation he says because out of the
[2:38] sea out of the
[2:39] Ages come the
[2:42] seals and out of the
[2:44] seals come the
[2:46] trumpets and out of the
[2:48] trumpets come the
[2:50] vials like the first
[2:53] verse of a Roman
[2:55] Candle the seven Church
[2:58] Ages come forth with a mighty initial
[3:05] illumination without
[3:07] which there can be no further
[3:10] light but once the Brilliance of the
[3:13] seven Church
[3:15] ages is given by divine
[3:19] revelation then light upon light follows
[3:24] that until the whole of the
[3:28] Revelation open opens wide before our
[3:31] wondering
[3:33] eyes and we are
[3:37] edified and
[3:39] purified by its
[3:41] spirit and we are made ready for his
[3:44] glorious
[3:46] Superior even our Lord and
[3:49] savior the one and true God Jesus Christ
[3:54] amen amen hallelujah so this is the
[3:57] introduction brother ad is giving
[4:01] for the seven Church
[4:02] ages you understand what is the purpose
[4:06] for it to edify to purify by the spirit
[4:11] of
[4:12] God the church to be made
[4:16] ready for the Glorious appearing of our
[4:19] Lord Jesus
[4:21] Christ when we look into the
[4:23] message many people in a carnal
[4:27] mind or trying to interpreted by
[4:31] something that they can
[4:34] see with their natural
[4:37] eye they are looking for brother Braham
[4:40] to come out
[4:44] plainly and say this is what it
[4:48] is and it's not like that brothers and
[4:52] sisters I do say that there's many
[4:56] things in the message that he did come
[4:59] out out plainly and said this is what it
[5:03] is amen but there's many things in the
[5:08] message many
[5:10] truths many
[5:12] Revelations that are in the message that
[5:15] he did not come plainly out and say
[5:18] it but he pointed us to certain
[5:22] scriptures he pointed us to certain
[5:25] types he pointed us to certain
[5:28] revelation
[5:30] that the True Believer the Bride of
[5:32] Jesus
[5:33] Christ could take these
[5:35] messages could take these
[5:38] tapes and by divine
[5:41] revelation catch amen the
[5:44] mystery of what is within that and then
[5:48] you yourself as a believer that have a
[5:53] commandment to search the scriptures to
[5:57] search the message to look into the
[5:59] these things amen and shake off our l ly
[6:04] in
[6:05] spirit and really get into the
[6:07] word and really get into the
[6:10] message that God has given
[6:12] us then we would be able to
[6:17] dovetail all the
[6:19] scriptures all of the Bible with what
[6:23] certain key points that brother bam
[6:26] gave and that's why when we begin to
[6:28] talk and we begin to preach and we begin
[6:30] to maybe you too as as a
[6:36] Believer you begin to
[6:38] share many
[6:40] Revelations that you have received in
[6:42] the message the carnal believer knows
[6:45] not what you're talking
[6:47] about they don't even know if that came
[6:50] from the message or you're just making
[6:51] it
[6:53] up and they don't even know what the
[6:56] first part of what you're
[6:58] saying
[6:59] because it shows that they're not in the
[7:02] spirit of Revelation for the
[7:05] hour this message did not come to make
[7:07] us intellectual
[7:10] people this message is only for a
[7:13] prophetic class of
[7:15] people that already have the
[7:18] capacity inside of that Gene to receive
[7:22] the
[7:23] Revelation that is contained in this
[7:26] message it's not that we're trying to
[7:28] work ourselves up to know these
[7:32] things is that we're
[7:35] predestinated with the capacity to
[7:38] receive this
[7:39] Revelation by the grace of God Amen but
[7:44] it it takes some
[7:46] dedication it takes
[7:49] interest it takes disconnecting yourself
[7:51] from the things of the
[7:53] world and really getting into the to the
[7:56] message of
[7:58] God amen amen this is the reason why the
[8:02] church in that condition will never be
[8:06] able to
[8:07] understand the truths that are laying
[8:10] within the
[8:11] message rapturing faith is laying in the
[8:13] message the revelation of the of the
[8:16] vows is laying in the
[8:17] message the seven Thunders is in the
[8:20] message of God the new name of God is in
[8:23] the
[8:24] message Hallelujah all of these
[8:27] Revelations are laying right there
[8:30] but it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal
[8:33] that to your
[8:34] soul because Satan cannot know this it
[8:38] can't be said out plainly for him to
[8:42] hear what it is but it's only given to
[8:45] his
[8:46] seed it's only given to the children of
[8:49] God by Supernatural
[8:53] Revelation Hallelujah and if we the
[8:55] bride of Jesus Christ are living under
[8:58] the seven seal and we're receiving the
[9:02] mystery we're part of that mystery and
[9:05] we're being caught up in the
[9:07] mystery in the seventh seal that it is
[9:11] for you and me Hallelujah to
[9:15] receive Hallelujah these Divine
[9:18] truths Hallelujah people think amen that
[9:22] their hearts are being turned back to
[9:25] the faith of the
[9:26] fathers just by knowing amen that this
[9:30] message is true or that God sent a
[9:33] prophet yes God sent a prophet yes he
[9:37] sent Malachi for to turn the hearts of
[9:41] the children back to the faith of the
[9:44] fathers but what is it what is going to
[9:47] turn the
[9:48] hearts of the children to the fathers
[9:52] what's going to do it is the
[9:55] supernatural
[9:56] Revelation that is in this message
[10:00] amen that's exactly what the prophet
[10:03] said he said that this
[10:06] messenger of the Le Church age was going
[10:10] to do two things he was going to turn
[10:13] the hearts of the children back to the
[10:16] faith of the fathers and the second
[10:19] thing that he was going to do he was
[10:22] going to
[10:23] reveal the
[10:25] mysteries of the seven Thunders which
[10:29] are the
[10:30] revelations contained in the Seven
[10:33] Seals and it will be these divinely
[10:38] revealed I want you to notice that how
[10:41] is it going to be it has to be divine
[10:47] revelation
[10:49] amen what kind of
[10:51] Revelation
[10:54] Divine that means it's not by human
[10:58] instrumentality
[11:01] that means is not by
[11:03] learning that means it's not
[11:06] amen by by uh uh uh your intellectual
[11:13] understanding hallelujah it's not by
[11:17] phonics is that right amen amen it's
[11:22] divinely
[11:24] reveal mystery
[11:26] truths that will literally
[11:29] turn the hearts of the children back to
[11:32] the faith of the fathers do you
[11:35] understand
[11:36] Mal will not be fulfilled if the people
[11:41] are not receiving divinely
[11:44] revealed mystery truths I don't care
[11:47] what they say what they testify what
[11:51] they claim their hearts are still in the
[11:54] same sinful
[11:57] condition if they have not not received
[12:00] Dively
[12:01] revealed mystery
[12:05] truths Hallelujah faith is
[12:09] revelation and it's
[12:11] impossible to please God without
[12:14] Revelation amen
[12:17] hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah so
[12:21] brother and
[12:23] sister I want you to understand the
[12:27] reason the purpose
[12:30] the
[12:31] burden amen the
[12:33] desperation of why we look into these
[12:37] things amen is
[12:41] for to
[12:43] fulfill in
[12:45] US exactly what this word was to
[12:49] fulfill do you understand he says it aan
[12:53] Church
[12:54] age the exposition of the church
[12:57] ages
[12:59] he
[13:01] says I have to hold to the
[13:05] word the way the Lord revealed
[13:09] [Music]
[13:11] it I did not cover it
[13:14] all this is the prophet telling you and
[13:18] me I haven't covered
[13:20] everything in other words I haven't gone
[13:24] through every
[13:25] verse in every chapter of the Bible
[13:29] see I haven't done that that's what the
[13:32] prophet is telling us can you say
[13:36] amen hallelujah
[13:38] hallelujah did he preach on every
[13:41] character in The
[13:43] Bible no he
[13:46] didn't did he did he preach from every
[13:49] chapter of the
[13:50] Bible
[13:53] no did he preach from every book in the
[13:57] Bible no no you don't find that in the
[14:03] message but how come we have the
[14:07] revelation of the whole
[14:09] Bible
[14:11] hu because there's a supernatural
[14:18] Revelation listen what he says this is
[14:21] the prophet telling you and
[14:24] me I did not cover it all
[14:31] amen
[14:34] amen that would
[14:39] take a separate
[14:41] book in other words he would have to
[14:44] write another
[14:47] Bible amen amen and that would be
[14:50] against the word
[14:52] itself amen but by the help of the
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] Lord we will
[15:01] get many
[15:03] sermons and
[15:05] tapes and

[16:43] Feast of the
[16:46] trumpets he says let me say this right
[16:53] here every
[16:55] trumpet talking about the seven trumpets
[17:00] how many
[17:01] know that there's only one place in the
[17:04] Book of
[17:06] Revelation that these seven trumpets
[17:09] sound in other words there's not two
[17:13] places where there is a
[17:17] succession of seven
[17:20] Trumpets the seven trumpets
[17:23] begin in the eighth chapter of
[17:27] Revelation goes to the ninth
[17:29] chapter and then there is an interval or
[17:35] breach chapter
[17:38] 10 and then in chapter
[17:41] 11 you have the seventh
[17:45] trumpet amen amen now listen to what
[17:48] brother Bram
[17:50] says every
[17:53] Trum
[17:54] Lo under the Sixth
[17:57] Seal
[18:00] amen he says it again all the
[18:05] trumpets
[18:07] sounded under the Sixth
[18:12] Seal Hallelujah and he says the
[18:17] trumpet is to call together the
[18:22] people assemble
[18:25] themselves gathering together for
[18:28] something
[18:30] amen amen then he
[18:33] says what was the what was the
[18:37] trumpet Revelations
[18:40] 87 did we read that
[18:42] tonight says Revelations
[18:45] 87 we noticed the first
[18:49] trumpet there was
[18:53] scattered
[18:54] hail Blood Fire upon the Earth
[19:00] just
[19:01] exactly with
[19:04] Exodus with the book of
[19:06] EX when God was calling his
[19:11] people
[19:13] outu the
[19:15] ex you
[19:18] [Music]
[19:19] understand so he says
[19:23] all the
[19:26] trumpets sound
[19:29] under the six se souls in prison
[19:34] now he says remember in The Sixth Seal
[19:39] all seven

[19:59] Allelujah
[20:01] amen under the Sixth
[20:03] Seal were these trumpets
[20:08] open amen
[20:10] am and this is what I wanted to end with
[20:14] right
[20:16] here recognizing your
[20:19] day and his
[20:21] message
[20:24] 1964 brother Bram
[20:27] says
[20:34] paragraph
[20:36] 35
[20:39] now seven
[20:42] sabbaths represented the seven Church
[20:46] ages to be
[20:48] called in the time of the Pentecostal
[20:52] Feast to call a
[20:55] people from the
[20:57] Gentiles for his
[20:59] name at the end of the seven
[21:03] Sabbath which has
[21:06] been there was to be the day of
[21:10] atonement which was seven
[21:15] trumpets and the Seven
[21:17] trumpets was to
[21:20] call a day of
[21:23] morning back to the
[21:26] sacrifice the atonement
[21:29] and we find out then that
[21:32] Israel the seven
[21:34] trumpets pertained only to
[21:39] Israel then
[21:41] why he wouldn't let me
[21:45] preach them seven

[21:53] it I had the Halls
[21:56] ready and
[21:59] everything ready to go
[22:02] into and preach the seven
[22:05] trumpets and I said there is something
[22:08] bothering me so

[22:13] working Billy and all of us trying to
[22:18] get everything
[22:19] ready for the air conditioned
[22:23] building for this next coming
[22:26] week for the
[22:28] trumpets having 10 days or eight days to
[22:34] preach them had the school
[22:37] auditor but the Holy Spirit would not
[22:41] let me do it for some
[22:47] reason am how many can say amen for some
[22:52] reason and I wondered
[22:55] why amen amen I wondered why and when I
[23:00] went in to
[23:02] pray Hallelujah you see brother brandom
[23:07] is showing us that when he was looking
[23:11] for this
[23:12] Revelation he goes to
[23:15] pray that God will show him the reason
[23:19] why how many know that he preached the
[23:21] Seven Seals by
[23:24] faith amen did he know all of it before

[46:26] um when they was uh he thought he was
[46:29] the only one was going to be in the
[46:31] Rapture only one going to be
[46:46] saved I said 700 instead of 7,000 is
[46:50] that
[46:54] right
[46:58] I'm sure sorry of that folks I I know
[47:01] better than that it was just simply a
[47:02] Mumble of speech because I know it was
[47:17] 7,000 I just didn't say it right I I I
[47:20] thank you and that means that I'm glad
[47:22] that you're watching what I say and you
[47:24] see then uh that's because it it's it's
[47:27] 7 down I got two three notes on it it
[47:29] said brother Brandon uh I believe you
[47:32] were mistaken it said wasn't a 7,000
[47:35] inad of
[47:54] 700
[48:03] I didn't say
[48:05] 700 then I Billy and then first thing I
[48:09] picked up another note and said brother
[48:11] I believe you
[48:24] said
[48:26] and one person said brother BR was that
[48:29] a a spiritual vision that that there
[48:32] just going to be a tight and you're
[48:34] tight with the it puts people on age
[48:36] when you go thinking these same things
[48:39] and it's enough it puts me on the
[48:54] age
[48:59] something happened a day when this seal
[49:01] was revealed I had to walk completely
[49:03] out in the yard just walk right out the
[49:05] yard a little while that's right it just
[49:07] simply almost took my breath right away
[49:09] from it see so it's attention oh
[49:24] my
[49:33] for another thing see you're laying
[49:35] right on to what I say and God's going
[49:37] to only me responsible what I tell you
[49:39] see and so I I'm must absolutely be as
[49:42] sure as all sure can be sure of these
[49:45] things because this is a a tremendous
[49:48] time that we're
[49:54] living
[50:11] think the healing service for Monday
[50:13] night
[50:24] that
[50:31] they just make one a
[50:34] pattern it's a it certainly has been a a
[50:39] real Chum and friend to
[50:41] [Applause]
[50:54] me
[50:58] the Tabernacle now built got the Sunday
[51:01] School rooms everything ready and order
[51:04] here and some of you people that's
[51:06] around here right je want to come to
[51:08] church got a nice place and place to
[51:10] come
[51:24] Sund
[51:29] teacher and here for the adult class and
[51:33] a real Pastor I don't say after toate to
[51:37] him but I'd rather give him a little
[51:38] Rose now than a whole reap after he's
[51:40] gone and brother brother Neville I've
[51:43] know him since I was just a ball and he
[51:45] hasn't changed one bit he's still arming
[51:48] Neville just like he
[51:54] always
[52:15] I remember visiting even he had Grace to
[52:18] ask me to his P pit when he has a
[52:20] Methodist preacher now here in the city
[52:23] and U we had a nice ation down there in
[52:27] Clarksville I guess that's called the
[52:28] hard Park Harrison Avenue Methodist
[52:47] churchard
[52:50] Park Harrison I think that's where he
[52:53] must found you
[53:02] was I come back up I said to the church
[53:05] I said that was that's one of the nicest
[53:08] man and one of these days I'm going to
[53:10] baptize him in the name
[53:12] [Applause]
[53:24] of
[53:28] there he is and now he's my ch right
[53:30] along my side such an honorable
[53:33] respectable man he's always stood by me
[53:36] just like it's as close as he could
[53:38] stand whatever I say he just lays right
[53:41] with him
[53:54] along
[53:58] even when he first come in he didn't
[54:00] understand the message then but he
[54:01] believed that he stayed right with it
[54:04] that's honor that's respect to brother
[54:06] like that I can't say enough and now the
[54:09] Lord
[54:24] bless
[54:29] all right now a little preview of last
[54:33] evening and the breaking of the fifth
[54:36] seal we won't go all the way back
[54:37] tonight just back far enough to get the
[54:39] the fifth
[54:54] seal
[54:55] how we find out that there was the
[54:58] Antichrist that rode on and wound
[55:02] himself up from three powers all went
[55:05] into one power and rode the pale Hearts
[55:09] death into a botom
[55:24] into
[55:31] and then we find out when the the
[55:34] scripture says when the enemy comes in
[55:37] like a flood the spirit of God raises up
[55:40] a standard against it and we see it
[55:42] perfectly Vindicated in the word last
[55:45] night or there was four Beast that had
[55:51] answered to the the four uh times that
[55:55] this ride or
[56:20] Ro and he wrote a different horse each
[56:23] time a white horse and then a red horse
[56:26] and a black horse and a Pale Horse and
[56:29] we found out those colors and what they
[56:31] were and what they did then take it
[56:34] right back into the ages of the churches
[56:36] and exactly that's what it done just
[56:53] perfectly
[57:03] therefore you see when the word of God
[57:05] Blends together that mean it's correct
[57:08] you see yeah I believe anything that
[57:11] hooks with the word of God is always
[57:13] amen
[57:23] amen
[57:30] I like a person said they had a vision
[57:34] and said it uh it was all they know the
[57:37] Lord give it because it come with great
[57:39] power well that Vision might be all
[57:41] right but if it isn't with the word and
[57:43] contrary to the word
[57:53] right
[58:08] may be some bre or sister they may be
[58:12] some get these Tes now I don't want to
[58:15] say that some of the finest people I you
[58:17] want to meet being Mar people very fine
[58:22] type of
[58:23] people
[58:43] and then there their Prophet Joseph
[58:45] Smith that the Methodist people killed
[58:47] here in Illinois on the journey
[58:53] over
[58:56] and so then that that fine man and the
[59:01] vision I don't doubt at all but what he
[59:03] had the vision I believe it's a sincere
[59:14] man but the vision he had was contrary
[59:17] to the scripture
[59:19] amen therefore they had to have a mar
[59:21] Bible to make it see this is it here to
[59:25] me this just the word that's it
[59:49] Hallelujah uh a a minister came here
[59:52] from a foreign country and me I see him
[59:56] out with the riding around the car with
[59:59] which is not uh with a lady and uh they
[1:00:04] come to a
[1:00:18] meeting and I found out that drove to
[1:00:21] three days just he and she in the me to
[1:00:24] come the meeting together and uh the
[1:00:27] woman had been married three or four
[1:00:28] different
[1:00:42] times and this Minister walked up in the
[1:00:44] hotel lobby where was and Shu hands with
[1:00:48] I shook his hand raised up to talking to
[1:00:49] him I asked him I said um when your free
[1:00:54] could I speak to you in my room just a
[1:00:56] moment he said certainly brother
[1:01:17] BR talk him to the room and I said to
[1:01:20] the minister I said Reverend sir uh
[1:01:24] you're a stranger in this land I said
[1:01:27] but this lady has a quite a name I said
[1:01:31] are you come all way from such and such
[1:01:33] a place down such and such a place said
[1:01:36] yes
[1:01:52] sir and I said you aren't you afraid
[1:01:55] that that'll kind of I I I'm not
[1:01:57] doubting you but don't you think that'll
[1:01:59] reflect on your reputation as a minister
[1:02:01] don't you think we should put a little
[1:02:03] better example than
[1:02:20] that and he said oh this lady's a saint
[1:02:23] I said I don't
[1:02:24] that but I said but brother the thing of
[1:02:27] it is everybody looks at her and not a
[1:02:31] saint I look at what you're doing and I
[1:02:34] said I believe you got be careful about
[1:02:36] this one brother to
[1:02:53] another
[1:03:03] and he said I said the lady's been
[1:03:05] married four or five times now and he
[1:03:07] said yes I know that said you know I I I
[1:03:10] said you don't teach that in your church
[1:03:12] at home do you for that so said no but
[1:03:14] said you know I had a vision of it
[1:03:16] brother brand I said well that's
[1:03:23] fine
[1:03:44] I said he said you might I believe I can
[1:03:47] straighten out a little bit on your
[1:03:48] teaching about that and I said all right
[1:03:50] and I said I'll be glad to know it sir
[1:04:11] and he said well I said you
[1:04:14] know in this Vision he said I was asleep
[1:04:18] and I said yeah I seen that was a
[1:04:23] dream
[1:04:31] and he said uh my my wife said she had
[1:04:35] been living with another man and said
[1:04:38] running around on me and said then she
[1:04:40] come to me and she said to me oh darling
[1:04:43] forgive me forgive me that I I I I'm
[1:04:46] sorry I did it I'll be true from now
[1:04:48] said of course I love her so much I just
[1:04:50] forgive her said all
[1:04:52] right me
[1:05:16] and said and said you know what then I
[1:05:19] got the interpretation of this Vision so
[1:05:22] that was a woman said sure she's been
[1:05:24] married and so forth all these
[1:05:40] times and said that it's all right for
[1:05:44] her to marry because the Lord loved her
[1:05:45] so much she marri many times as she
[1:05:47] wants
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:53] to
[1:05:58] I said your vision was mighty sweet but
[1:06:01] it off the
[1:06:03] beaten that's that's wrong see you
[1:06:06] shouldn't do
[1:06:19] that so that see but when you see
[1:06:23] scripture a doveet tailing with
[1:06:26] scripture making it a constant uh uh um
[1:06:32] continuity or they come together the
[1:06:34] scriptures or this one leaves off here
[1:06:37] this other over here comes and dve Tails
[1:06:39] in draws the whole picture
[1:06:53] out
[1:07:02] like putting a crossw word puzzle
[1:07:04] together like you find the piece that
[1:07:06] fits in there nothing else can fit it
[1:07:09] then you're getting the picture fixed
[1:07:11] and the only one can do that that's the
[1:07:14] lamb and so we're looking to
[1:07:22] him
[1:07:33] but we find that when these this Rider
[1:07:36] he was one Rider that rode these horses
[1:07:40] and then we chased him right down seen
[1:07:42] what he' done and everything and found
[1:07:44] out back in the church ages that's
[1:07:46] exactly what he
[1:07:52] did
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:08:02] when he went out on a certain beast and
[1:08:05] done a certain thing we find out that
[1:08:08] there was one sent to comat what he
[1:08:20] did there's one sent for the first age
[1:08:23] of L of line was the word of course
[1:08:25] Christ next was the ox during a time of
[1:08:29] the Dark Age when when the church had
[1:08:34] organized accepted dogas instead of the
[1:08:52] word
[1:08:57] and remember the whole thing is based on
[1:09:00] two things one of antichrist the other
[1:09:03] of Christ it's still the same thing
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:18] today there is no halfway
[1:09:21] Christians there's no drunk Silverman
[1:09:24] no black white birds no no no sinner
[1:09:28] Saints no you're either a sinner or
[1:09:31] Saint there no between you're either
[1:09:33] born again or you're not born
[1:09:52] again
[1:09:57] you're either fill with the Holy Spirit
[1:09:58] you're not fill with the Holy Spirit no
[1:10:00] matter how many Sensations you with the
[1:10:02] Holy Spirit you're not f
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:16] with and if you have been f with it your
[1:10:19] life
[1:10:21] shows nobody yet tell anybody they see
[1:10:25] it's a
[1:10:39] seal now we find those beasts how they
[1:10:43] wrote each time one sat out on his
[1:10:46] ministry and political Powers United uh
[1:10:50] religious powers and and political
[1:10:52] Powers together
[1:11:06] we find out God sent out his power to
[1:11:08] combat it we go right back see what the
[1:11:10] church age was and look back and there
[1:11:12] it was just exactly that
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:22] way
[1:11:25] and we find out another Age come along
[1:11:28] and the enemy sent out the Antichrist
[1:11:30] under the name of religion or the name
[1:11:33] of Christ or the name of the church yes
[1:11:37] sir when out the name of the church that

[1:17:58] against her the grace of God is cover
[1:18:01] over and bleach struck every sin of far

[1:19:37] not be revealed to this day
[1:19:39] exactly they was was guessed at but now
[1:19:43] we're supposed to get it exactly the
[1:19:45] truth the
[1:19:51] truth
[1:20:06] now it
[1:20:07] was a little uh girl in the west that
[1:20:11] how should should uh fell in love with a
[1:20:15] man had fell in love with her a fire the
[1:20:18] cattle come out there for the armor

[1:22:01] hand on them they just go native out
[1:22:03] there they're trying to live in
[1:22:05] something in the back gone
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:20] days and then Kentucky you're trying to
[1:22:23] live in a byone days of the Easter I can
[1:22:27] R for Valley and things you like to go
[1:22:29] back to the old days something cusing
[1:22:47] that but when it comes back to go back
[1:22:49] to a gospel in the you don't want to do
[1:22:53] that you want
[1:23:04] [Applause]
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:06] something what makes a man do wrong what
[1:23:10] makes him drink and carry on or a woman
[1:23:12] do wrong is because she's trying to
[1:23:15] there's something in her thirsting
[1:23:17] something in him
[1:23:21] thirsting
[1:23:38] and they're trying to quench that Holy
[1:23:40] thirst for the things of the world when
[1:23:42] God ought to be that quench he made you
[1:23:45] that way too thirst that's the reason
[1:23:47] you thirst for something God made you
[1:23:49] that way so you turn up holy thirst to
[1:23:52] him
[1:24:15] but when you try to quench that how dare
