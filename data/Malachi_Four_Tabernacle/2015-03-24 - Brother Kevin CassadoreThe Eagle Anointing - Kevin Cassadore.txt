========================================
nobody home Lord Jesus cry that's what we come to worship and it all I got that's who we come to praise amen everyone's talking about and that's what we covered in here this morning yeah and once I'll be getting this not have to speak to an orange I got nervous I pray the voice of the Holy Spirit look at I was expected to speak to every heart this morning I had a thought process or that's the way I hate a man I'm never desiring Travis yeah I mean are Hungary that word of thought where's my radios I just wanted to give an out you after the service whatever it is but it is there these are all invited to the park here most positive thoughts I tell about it behind the church is it leaned only port and if I can't drive a car for a time of fellowship but I go Vanity's Montana by both kind of ethos and service to see you know so so recently at 5:30 when I think we made the reason you give this announcement now that's what that allows a niche to just let the Holy Spirit have its liberties but I think I also do that now that it's videos up and after or goes forth his brother cares about it that we could remain in that very worship that most concise scripted lol and whatever the Lord is doing a bonus or cosas para server versus ratings to not interrupt that amen and I hope you guys yeah they're bad so we're glad to see the Lord move content those of it out it's not going to speak to us amen yeah one hand how many believe the Lord spoke to us last night well if there's a lot not you as a man a spiritual warfare together like a man prepare our heads for war if I want to modify together amen the weapons of our warfare I thought that'd be easier I'm not calling us all cosmetics their mighty involved as well it also send us to the pulling down of strong is that a man watching as their brother said already what a survivor not so much against demon but the battle within us we're in the valley of decision revenge said that's where the battle takes place you say all right case you say it's in the mind is there anything because that's where decisions are made okay that's enough this is yours is that right and the message letting off the pressure inside out that's your or the venom should I believe that pressure mind oppress atmosphere that we feeling it's not as if you look in this shower next hour not only at work not only at home that's what I got somebody said even in church when they gets here this is everywhere this pressure they stop our core values I want a man you feel that pressure we feel time getting bit shorter chores I don't sense it was a simple say I call it back out as months we feel time long time he said that pressure that we feel separate focus and each I believe the enemy no president pressing down a balanced person and look he says so that we can make the wrong decision toss another service have a Haman he says because when you're under pressure oh okay sure amen okay he said you say thing this is closer you do think I suppose I said you wouldn't do then audience if you take the time the one I said him to sit down and think of how they meditated the word that he made about it and put the word before us she says but under that pressure you make decisions so this is shows your same thing pieces closest that you normally wouldn't earn if I meant that no audience so that's let off the pressure dishes guess what I'm saying is I may have a man we have the victory they know whatever thought you to know our Lord Jesus Christ that must at least is our brother Kevin cash the door comes up tomorrow okay we can say don't even let

your pastor brother Diego Christmas bonus Monday before the warm invitation well we have to say man we appreciate that but a single says you know the Bible says we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together even more so as you see the Day approaching okay then I think rather we can look around us follow me and we can see the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh you're gonna answer pepero scheme under the time like that - I see you should be able to get together but I'm about to encourage one another one another to bless each other and this evil stop not to not argue about every one hour to debate yeah or to put one another now or to find fault in each other we could build each other up once any bad one we are the Saints of God then it's not like precious thing that's the paper that's your sign and I tell you what the okay that paid this precious I think so and it's becoming more precious in the prospects as you see that you're this body is becoming hard to find as much did

it yes take it up a Pew come on when I say well I sit in the chair but I said but you've got to be ready because I least but you've got to get in then it can that surrender your life before me I ain't yet filled with the Holy Ghost and continue to surrender me and every day go to the island walk by me not in the spirit of dogs I'm gonna see so that God can teach you the best God couldn't stretch in the place to me and he can raise you like to be his bride who know you've got a surrender who's gonna give me this dog we're gonna do this as real as you allow him to be you got to let him we're gonna have you gotta quit fighting resisting it's yourself to the leadership I raise you up day for you to be it'll take the surrender wine maybe I'd be an amazing grace Sam you'll make it in time amen now as we look this morning I'm gonna stop me I want to preach to you this morning nobody guys next time I had my the help of the Holy Ghost about the Eagle age Aguila and we look in first Corinthians denouncing their iniquity and Paul is talking about wisdom he's comparing human with stomach with wisdom of God or some videos and Paul says finally said that the wisdom of this world is realistic mundo is foolishness yes he said that this to God are the alive but yet to the world own a mundo the power of God and whether the wisdom of God said you get it when they're preaching of the Cross is foolishness is a to the world I won't go to them who do not believe us can open it but unto us that believe Graham do you believe this show on to you we it is the power of God's and whether they be off to salvation I'm not sure how Allah says in verse 22 perform a message juice the Jews require a sign flughafen Senatus and the Greeks are looking for a little dispenser Judea but yet here we are at this time Richard Christ Jesus okay so he's stumbling block to the to be ironical nails and polish this to the Greeks and this I will be able but handle up to them that are called because whenever are going to get your call so not only do you believe or not because you know your recall to believe in citizen up against my company who are chosen to believe me or what are you left it for them to say he's a boy this is your purpose this is proposing in life and yeah you've got a reason for living I wasn't giving me there's a reason you were born as what can I say there's a reason God brought you in here does that there is a reason you're right here in this took place in this moment then when I see them I don't believe in coincidences like would say it's not really there's any coincidence or there's a divine purpose lead into your life well that's where you can find divine purpose as well as community and this is one of the things that the devil wants to rob you on the camera body wants to blind you think I see this is why I tried to impress you because he knows father of it phone equals n daughter of the Most High God there's no side pieces never has not only the children authority de semana if he tries to go press you only because he's afraid of you I didn't come on to come to the realization of the pink etcetera as opposed to me who you are who you are in Jesus Christ Jesus and it's a peaceful principle but the hell so we understand what if we're called if someone's had my shoulders in this book until the leave but I pay a half faith by the neck thing into the Jews of Greeks believe it may be foolishness that's had to what on other words but I'm going to the world I live up to the unconverted were like when we commit to the Ottoman unconverted Jews and Greeks lose equal men see it's foolishness he said how things look to you that are calls take a time I know I like how Paul uses that word because I'm gonna flip on you say to you that are calls everyone every because it shows this so much deeper what it's talking about for who didn't just believe it or just saying that you believe that's what the denominations do that so the copy wants to believe okay raise your hand okay there it is that's all it's polka but it's so much more than that Moscow they say you were called to this for this you are the child Jacob and Esau before internet was even born again I said before they even had an opportunity I arrived I say they don't wanna bother because God knew yeah just like he knows you he knows that we are called thank you so much about us now this is why is that I'm someone you can believe who's there for today and this is why Hixton is so when the world says its foolishness once again Gokula you say it's like they say Smita that's why they look at you okay sitting in a service like this we poked away stay with the liberty of the Holy Ghost jumpin the baby I don't understand why they you know may not like funny but yeah well you look at their we're gonna say as they get excited these things simple money we never pay for material possession is my homes and cars right as he departed all these things of course I guarantee they're gonna be people that fall into this kind of the money I think I pick anybody them they want to enjoy their in here tonight so what's the first thing they do know guessing they write themselves a check cuz it'll check it and they go shopping if I need the confidence to buy a nice big expensive car will not go get a nice expensive clothing you know buddy I don't buy a new house or to I don't know that's how nice location oh we got there livin it up I mean it'll get according to the world so whatever they're gonna join their inheritance with us what is it that's only temporaries don't justify what they have look again it can only last on this world wherever that able to be put your Treasury so far lead up somewhere it now it's foolishness to the world you look for that movable hey what God is doing in the word that we have with the devil's it's a power of love it's a quality of the wisdom of God he's heavy energies that are called authentic so how are in wisdom police have the we have to those two things so those kinds of comments giving us power and it's also giving us wisdom Olivia you know wisdoms are very important keys because a lot of people can have power in it other people can have an emotion even have a gift or they don't but wisdom Leah - no you said appropriate and said I mean according to God's words don't happen on it do and so wisdom I think I said these are very important parts about them about the Christian life he's gonna not knowledge but close even knowledge is different wisdom gets a Vidya knowledge means you know something basically comes out but just because you know it Koko's it doesn't necessarily mean you gotta do it for example or here you might know CPR has professor because they know it's their job reduce power it is with expertise Olivia to let that are called I took this one about and the floor is of God who is wise within them is my solid element and the the weakness of God honor you know they'd be that much worth it well you see your Colin was Tennessee elemental aren't you glad you see your caller who you are this I can see the vapor him cement to have a royal see the vapor hand I'll release me that around and now not many wise men you know much longer this habit it's not many mighty or noble men as long as quoted all social anomie aren't columns for their mothers but God chooses if it smoking a foolish things of this world we've got another correctamundo to confound the wise particle from their low time that's a striking statement that's what I do just not many mighty not many noble ones with no but how many wise men was one better side of our call for their mothers now Jesus all right guess who he also said I mean decent then he said thank you Father I guess by that you have hit these things yes of course I saw the wise and prudent I music-related so these men wise and mighty but also seaside but yet not calm dose when your mother Jesus said he desired prophesied of me who could put up opportunity and he said that with ears you can hear manage what you don't understand they would give it they didn't have another there was nothing within their mine I think they respond to the word by so they could hear it a little either but there was nothing to recharge yesterday I was put there there was no too deep that called out to the deep we look at clinical the enemy because unto them that are calling before models there's some neck and on the insanity monitor that is pulling you to the things of God and if there's a pull on the inside of you deep then there's gotta be a boat on the other side the other one I respond to that hunger if you're relying on vehicle Nina and to feel the void that your inner killing that was it also can take any so now that you are called on achates am I understand we're called picked from there how many mighty men so much God chooses the foolish things of the world overlooked what are they let me stop for a minute Poppa Ackerman you can take a look around today we're not away and people what they're doing with this message I think these are walking away from it it's not a user they're all intellectual line but they try to fix things and they sort of and they start walking away listen I in think deny the word the devil just takes them so far never fight you see we cannot understand the word well then have another human intellectual wisdom and if I don't mind there's only one way for family I have no Lord it dog that's in the revelation of the Holy Ghost as white dots unlike other men say that God would not reveal anything to John until I mean I know this here he's a key that Paul goes on the same day by the way he said we do not speak the wisdom of the world I don't so now they come up with wisdom of God you know so he reveals a man okay and we know that I is not seeing something else what my ears not hurt and it's not even in the heart of the man can see the person they don't believe all the things that's going on is prepared a witness not for a minute you know gee little sense and so these until his disciples she is equal one day he told them we're gonna think he said it is given unto you before sense out of it is given to you it's not just meant for you this finance know the kingdom of God we're call okay it was spent it was ordained for you who didn't understand it was meant for you to know the word I was gonna sign up without me now the Bible says it's gonna be so Jesus says yes will be say unto you it is given go says I don't know the Word of God does not give him I suppose everybody now Paul says in 1st Corinthians 9 the madman does what he says I has not seen in years let her know he not into the heart of man unless all the things not as prepared to know something about buddy now I've heard the denominational world on it we're gonna take this scripture just get out but they don't never read the next one in fact look any less again say it's all hidden away that's what he knows understand but you cannot isolate the word they can say something up examine it doesn't say no Beeson you can't just take that one for every person is you gotta take the one next to it has built there I'm gonna go goodbye the spear when I speak I listen here we have something produces thirdly lying if a man quit and that is the power of God to salvation because the Holy Spirit will get is through sample has revealed about ten photos I do yeah amen therefore your game you're not lost let's that's been healings right we're not confused so let's go for the night come on now Iman you're not without understanding yesterday Phoebe give the worldly say you are and look it's I think I can see the denominations may say you are before I can see how they've not shown this others they say you are Oh who's that get to Z well we know where we're standing how do you know what it's because the Holy Spirit yeah well guess we just have to has come to us has come to you my understand personally on a personal level has taken this word has made it known to you know sanitation revealed it unto you because the spirit took it it's the searches all things as we have for the fifty things of God over a fool in the day so we so we understand I thinking at them and we cannot hide and of course going there behind the verse doesn't tells us plainly to keep everything on has revealed the deep things to us about that are along the Holy Spirit comes and makes it known to you yeah and you walk I mean a progressive revolution that's Oprah I see s God has so designed to tell you right now they may see my personal life personal estate said that God has a and has changed me on a very dangerous down there was revelation that God has brought to me along the years okay about that their assignments in this in the in the years I've been serving God's I'm talking about the twelve fourteen fifteen years I would serve of the man at once you can stay across they're gonna say no and God has brought me a long way doing that will come in as I get closer to human surrender more of my life to him in the bottle opens is worth to the igniters upon a bit deeper on a personal level I will put a handle like with your listen to a tape while you're reading the message you can read it the same one minute before the fifth time you catch the first time he did the proper God talk about at one time he thought the white horse rider revelation and it's all gonna see don't be afraid of it look at you know I used to hear folks make a statement I think they see that's crazy you know what all sprang about it I found this mongrel that for the past 20 years since we didn't make that fifth-years cigarette night news that they have all popped the same thing to both Python Ruby and I've heard of sounding differential not sound alright so again then you take a look at the message and the messenger you know that wasn't the case for him not guaranteed he's our enemy leader and knows as much the prophet of God did the second one of course was a boy story he was the messenger man a man who was seated before the throne of God revelations one that what the Bible say will get rid of the seven spirits with his needs are before the throne that they've done which were the seven messengers table to the seven ages the design but look at the word so you've seen I said get off let's reveal them do not even have them unto us by the spirit what are you speaking you know brother Brennan says like I said I'd rather have the right spirit just because I don't like the doctrine don't demand to have the right pocket they had a wrong Janus people not because it goes to show you watch them and if you maintain the right attitude and a Google right and the right spirit before God God can reveal his wedding yeah but I'm going to show you more you can progress can grow it's gonna say you can picture it smell around for a long time to the other church has instilled the excess thank you to a condition there's no growth there's no spiritual development 20 plus years of us are walking away from it today saying that it's wrong in a message pew was never any spirits all thought that it was the most petite quiet there's only man-made ideas to say nothing hot in here the Lord has revealed them to us the the things of God reveals it to us in the know Nevada it's meant for you to know it okay so I said God will reveal it to you but we've got to maintain that out of jargon sake book that Spirit of God is kind of yours a man may never get to the point to react well that you know at all because if you get to a point yes cool you know it all kind of wants us both dead no it can't help meet yourself open to the Holy Ghost about that God can change your thinking around the bank can change your idea rises in a that you leave yourself open to leadership of the whole did he get develop you where they're going but sure you there might not be gotta build you up on a foundation of whether or not I mean no start to get too long but I want to say this courtesy that's that we're living in a greedy Jews and they're gonna write brother reg says he called it the Eagle leave anyone other than I get I don't want to read a quote to you Josephine I next article from the message the countdown clock without a receiver in 1962 it mean those in those I want you to notice here what brother Brent says he's a cutthroat is if he says all things in the natural the Pope and another line or a type of things in the spiritual people cause be all right we understand that it's not that they were he says I believed in evolution so better than that I will show but not the way scientist says it whatever I want is gonna be people's they've already defeated themselves on that hardness but the great Holy Spirit turn administered this I begin to move over the years and there come up one form of life is enough for one of you now then another form of my thought for Olivia and it kept coming up and some food maybe so again until it come up the very image of the one that was moving over it whatever name I think was a relation of man lay my head open which was a mature like this the image of God signed today when God was made flesh that's what so happened and he was a man and I don't it never produced anything else over what my boss it never produced any anything greater think I said Kent looking up way the very creator was a man himself nobody amen now this is why a lot said guilty let us make man in our own the image behind our own likeness ascending I didn't have dominion over the earth if I'm thrown together now the question is okay what is the image of them getting my videos Jesus answers that is you know what they say in the book of that knowledge on you know they want in Chapter three but you know that tells us that God is the spirit against its people and they their worship they just have us worship in spirit and in tripping on this video so that God is the spirit ascendance be a thought said that's make man in our image of God he created man spirits this is why in Genesis okay hang on a couple chapters later this way let's say it's out of the dust of the earth woman at the end of form antibody for what breathed into his nostrils and that he's a breath of life I believe he became a living soul it was a not living in the image and the likeness of God send me my watch however the REM says he said that's the evolution I believe in you gonna sound words when you open a lot of the great Holy Spirit what has people time I believe don't Graham that's the way the Holy Ghost does to us today instead what those boys were designed them what do you get a church is dedicated this by then he got to the leadership of the holy shrine that's because the Holy Ghost can come down and it can bring over the church vessel as a complication of the Gaucho and every son and daughter oh just come outside wait so long no bonus here Seki modern hat buddy snack we have today Papa's here blue a let's get the nmos soy another which was going on at the modern world looks on arcade will no more there the scientific age that we are living in destiny kind of webbing equals they're so advanced and why my files their soul that's in modern times so when I was a typical that they don't even have time to pray we're getting a devil but I'm pleased to say listen to the sermon on the sailboat I'm gonna step on it now we just can't do that the time you see it's just in our head we we don't have time I don't really do the world sacrifice yes so I'm now with member but Anna quite a bit I like how he says this looks like one of these modern happenings that's what they seem at those well there is a forerunner of spiritual happening mystical totally looks like this even goes to speak like this now remember me but modern happenings are forerunners of spiritual - it does - on a second signals of a points the natural as the spiritual until I'll just be part each one accompanies each other goats I provided over and they only improve over the other so I don't know what I know one was already local I'm reading directly from the countdown over the others I think that happens in the natural course I do not learn the next thing that happens Jessica said it will be an improvement said oh never again look what's down there this is why it doesn't make sense it's a deal for example for Hitler look at the modern world we live today can we learn about the people soil we have we have technology they don't care about here we've got we've got cell phone there's no civilized and now when you compare the cell phones up today's episode is it always south homes of ten years ago that's an aside there is an improvement they've got smaller and watch the game gotten smarter mother baby hey is that right they can do a whole lot more than they used to do ten years ago I never remember where they work where they first came out you couldn't make a phone call that was it but I said once when I probably spoke and then the next version you could send a text message there's a window and then the base version it came out and cover and then just begin to improve so now not only can it call but wait am I mmm Senate Xmas in gentle fixable it can browse the Internet man it can't tell you where to go without me it's got all kinds of devices so the same in the natural that what happens one time if I said money is one that comes in the beginning this is what I mean now notice how he said discipline what he said that natural guess what I'm glad it's a type of the spirit actually by just reading so take for instance transportation that's what I feel he said at one day Julio there was a horse and buggy car you got an ax but now we've got inaudible the other one up a movie and it still has horsepower no Didache puts on a grinder but it was an advantage over the horse and cart back that's what I'm talking about it and the roll and we used to ride a horse of buzz on this economist and I basically took the article deal but the most about the movie and after the automobile was have a movie the Wright brothers the funders right came along and made in their place an IV or steel horsepower of course I got my incident improvements you could do more save my soul faster the old further than right left near the horse could get it back on you follow me Hosea now watch what he said so he says now listen coach coach again when anything happens on the earth I guess it was a together it is a warning there's my VIP it's a was something is fixing to happen is that it is here watch this now yeah with something happens on the earth on the bus and I get ready is a warning let's have a good something's going to happen from heaven 100x yeah look right here hit it what min does on earth are photogenic by his achievements ooh logos is something that God is fixing to do to his shirt look he said his head we came from a horse and buggy do it to an automobile come over to the airplane oh now the church are you gone has been enabled the spiritual line and I mean that's mean to achieve I don't have justification sanctification through West Linux on Thursday bus baptism the Holy Ghost now he's working on top and it is a shadow and a tight there are so many people of the achievement you know what God has been able to do so come on I'll remember they're quite a bit god you're fine with the Holy Spirit power good with it he was able to achieve by Luther her brother dedication have shown and when the church got justify whether was how they intend to get like this on I was getting him to lose some amazing through justification God was able to do it depressed his achievement is going to hit one man I'm gonna stand still long term impact on to the people when I think all right we're going down the next on us again God's achievement nobody was able to get away from the and preach sanctification something as you attend the church so they guess come from the horse so they come another article being off the movie now we've got more live but there was money and I had started running the church do in Azusa Street the ground are you following him the church took the church they wanna guess from an earth boundary nuclear deterrent to a soul in the old days people handbook just like the airplane I think it's what I do and the Holy Ghost came behind it you know as I say before design you see justification it's the horse it was say my education was the honorable thing I was letting out in and I'll begin to move along there's no man the baptism of the Holy Ghost is this where you took off the ground you got your feet off the ground before get up in the air now around in the head oh thank you man then people are like anything they got the feet off the ground so I found that God was able to bring his church of would answer yes and his achievement Radel when he got a bunch of people to look at the hand because stand still long ago so he's getting more the Holy Spirit in it for the sign now notice the same horsepower is enough what psychologists that can also horse did the same thing to inaudible about the movie and then to the airplane go whatever and that look what he says here okay the same Holy Spirit do a biga cycle that brought justification to the church I think I said it brought more of it somehow I say you want it brought sent to the king what's happening I said he poured it in with the Holy Ghost look whatever design until the same power with it with it right but but the same thing ready Michael then it took the church off of its feet but I said that this guess up into the heavens is better now things has changed all together because some Ian's is moving on that's insanity and we're always talking about science is how it's moving but let's look back and see what our great scientific teachers are doing here and we'll look at what God is doing with his church now we enter pH on the phone that I know Lord horses on our side no Lord automobile about the movie to tell the Lord airplane but my cell units now oh they're astronauts they don't astronaut that's right there's many seeds these space be all the heavenlies have these up in the space it's possibly says old lines about this is astronaut age what a race thing you gotta go now we're an astronaut and so has the church and everything that is the big sweep big honor that I can't get before the people and they have settled down for an airplane dude now the property god when he was here but that's my sake said this is something I have trouble getting across to the people who I didn't get because they settled for an airplane they don't know know what off this is an ashtray have settled down satisfy my seal this Center can't be nothing more without an airplane you do look good not knowing I'll tell you though that we've got something green I don't guess Oh Oh be ready I don't want to never settle I'm gonna go for just being identify all that God's promise critical oh brother sister you are balanced I don't want to shame God okay let's have it I want to receive all that has given to us already especially in the Shashtri on a pretty simple I want to settle for anything else then I'm like oh so what God's Word is fresh and only were my friends Coquina he says but you see Superman but you can't understand buddy today but not let's amend do something no matter school it is to show the church confidence that he God is doing something that's how see they're always trying to bring the old thing back he's looking a little mirror this is the church now I think I said I'll check the old things yeah his history as he's thrown yet it was all right if I'm up yeah and it's me as with the epicenter yeah it was all right on his date without amen shake hands with the preacher Lazar a long time ago I see people talking but that's passed now goes off boss hell yeah the nomination has lived out at stage notice we never yields with your pack step now focus also yeah we're in the astronaut amen he says I begin a federal interest in the debate has what stopped the people all turned around and hit the door I would counter they don't know what to think about these things inside of us they don't know how to get it cuz I'm gonna see them this astronaut is the spirit because they didn't put blinders on see certain things just to show us beyond this you're positive it has the Holy Spirit searches out all things and the big things have governor for Millennials oh praise the Lord Yeti's tells us no decent inste same spirit we was beaten it is the same power to a woman it's not something new have a look it's not something different it's the same power well they have seen the spirit so what's this guy that's the extra now eighth man so if that is in the natural just elicited the spirit tested on Johnson sounds to be thought back to the church went from an airplane shut up he's not getting somebody a viola and it has taken a higher flight know what I and that's the way God is doing it now but you don't want our instead of bringing out some little school guy talk about a certain creep that was happy two years ago he said he says God is proof robot people are talking about being modern and then I realize I may call that modern and when some of animal this is modern isn't what he said this is modern system is is modern according to the kingdom of God knows what everybody really Eagles and eagles not heard of members no they're not we need to sword in the heavenly guest center that I will say is that all about an amen God's prophet rising on the scene well don't say it i sell-- thankful we are for that all right so some would eat what is it his spiritual manifestations or historicity by this Oh spiritual word if I obviously thought incoming literally full filled before us now watch this yeah he said the Prophet on the ages more than that what it was a spiritual manifestation when my son is a part of the spiritual work people are becoming full feel before us literally literally fulfilled before at the Saturday okay I'm gonna with which is a revealing of Jesus Christ and in a database because Jesus Christ is the word horizon but actually that word reveal is you see it's revealing Jesus Christ I know salvation of the church oh yeah and now that word that's how I got a spirit it's me it takes that word but once I find out we read in the Bible searches all things it makes that word known to man appeals to them - it's an unveiling today it's an unveiling of Jesus and ladies he's reveals more of his work because that is the foundation upon which the church is built there's not another yeah there's a quote I wish I had it with me now Becky we're brother man talks about Romanticism they find these and he said there is too much truth okay we're not in this message to get caught up in finances there's too much truth yeah God's word has been revealed to you and I said what about Haiti to start isolating things I'm going to get caught up in the finances peace I want to just take off it is yeah the Holy Spirit in my life piccola suppose it's looking to be done quick in this word and it'll bring forth life of its own yes the action on age is Robert brother that says work should the church be inside I guess we should be lifted up guys way above everything which one's Hannibal that's right whatever the spiritual astronaut is Eagles that's not that's my thoughts on ideas hey man give me that president says the spiritual astronaut he said my penis about that is high schools he goes beyond all denominational creeds mechanic what get building mr. Knight and barriers by this I'll be on denominational think you owe beyond the cloudy thoughts Rose any and he looks up above the Stars the astronaut believer again if that's what now is also up in the heavenlies is far beyond their earthbound things have a nice way up high 39 he's an outer space it's possible see the earthly man I don't know kind of that doesn't know very much about outer space astronauts or not is in outer space as possible he's there with the disabled native and that's the reason so I met the church to me it's all wait they don't understand because that same scripture of first Corinthians in the Dominican chapter to happy little goes in first number 11 there's a little bit all the time which is where we left office with all those guys it says for what a man knows that's the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God por que que los hombres las casas de la cocina little hombre que estan en lo que hace poco nada para su esposa de Dios si no any spirit little see a man does not know the things of the Spirit of God so the things that God knows no man sickening one of our second video syllabus videos first 12 now we have received not the spirit of the sport of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God you know total of no hemos recibido there's people in movements you know let's build okay pro-rated adios si vamos look at do suppose our conciliar so this is the key that I climb then you have the Spirit of God get inside experience because you have the Spirit of God witness videos all the things of God which and of course God freely gives to us similarly romantic verse 13 reso testing which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual with no comparison Ana's course alumina silicon a skin Cena and a spirit one gonna speak to an honest return now watch here verse 14 it is equal to opposite but the natural receives not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned pero en todas las américas guess on the dispute widows por que para él sólo una y una cuenta de por que hacer and NSF need is to eat on a chassis as Cruiser branch says a loose a pomegranate he said they don't know how to handle it Simon I don't know how to think about no sonicator spiritual things of God and body videos hey man oh man oh yeah the Bible says when it's gonna be freely given to us by God and the Holy Spirit is us this word Levi no I'm gonna say if we might understand waiting today now so like say our society why is it important to know look at this I can't why do I have to go look inside because you got to recognize anyone say your name booyah and it's messy if you everyone make the rapture because he headed out you back to recognize those han is a revealing of Jesus Christ I think it's a base and without the revealing of Jesus Christ and his buddies everything heaven our home by the Holy Ghost order the limit daughter I didn't mean to all those who will believe almost there are call I'll get this one at my home to the old boy that's a males beat them watching although because they can't that are called is what they're not like us raise another look as well Jesus Christ and you become United with it's why it's important to know the word available to us no one's gonna say another man says I'm gonna look quick without weight I'm gonna so we could come to a cold ramen but this is the sameness adjuvants I can count down without it is he says now they say one of these addictive three minutes to zero I say something's about to say you know what they're done so the time they've gotten scared it sounds time they've done their an extra not to feel so sorry they're counting down somehow they're going to leave the earth when I've had her and headed for the moon I said everybody's trying to get to the moon okay they want to get off the earth against it again do you see the spiritual application but I

is fixin to take a flight suppose I will take off to heaven be sighs you know that's the difference anyways that sounds cruise when I'm gonna put it is the truth or them about just look back through history they visit exploding everything happened both the spiritual his church see it you know what I said it's the truth I don't be more gonna say big and strong not the horse and buggy nothing I got it we're climbing above that the spiritual astronaut is in Christ I think he's and he is listening to the Word of God your countdown see where it's cool yeah I don't look about he's fixing to leave now so many things hang out now oh that was 1962 he's ready to leave now he said but he's leaving for heaven knows hey buddy tell him not to move he says yes we're headed for the rapture 10 is not a spiritual number this is an awareness but anyone knows that okay God's number is seven proves his perfect number hood up in effect his perfect number is said that little better said and his cap down

the seven miles up the road he says we have anybody coming he may have a glorious change I said no Rosa another man says here that God is looking for a man he can do look along but who will climb up into the heights like an equal to so that's not thrust upon how you drink this flight sounds a way to ankle pump into the heavenlies that's nice guy where all things are possible if I receive you above the earth bound clucking now here toward a propel hitting all four cylinders I was eight and the water jacket but busted on the inside it isn't moving up I want to be moving up I want to be moving toward God's perfection I don't want to get stuck in one place crawls probably talking about a god of the past out of the bench and I'll just take it what he did Batman or gauge right look at

okay we get and it gave me a list you know any stuff and then I spoke to him I said which one is the best one so it told me I'll sort it out through ratings okay this is the top one you see what the science world's doing the prophet of God said oh that's just a shadow once I saw what God is doing if the world see in the natural is that events what about us Christ and it's a base these were so advanced sometimes how the Spirit of God has been doing until the other thing I have we got now it was all right they have never been back there just like the article dealing about the more they
