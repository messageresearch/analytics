[0:00] Revelations chapter 10.
[0:03] if you understand our days
[0:06] if you understand what God is open to us
[0:10] in this house
[0:12] we understand that in Revelations
[0:15] yes so mighty Angel has come down and I
[0:18] can foreign
[1:26] when we
[1:47] in the back part of God's mind
[1:53] yes sir man that's what he taught us in
[1:55] that message
[1:56] and he said he has showed it in every
[2:00] type of the Bible
[2:02] it was something
[2:06] else foreign
[2:56] it was because God had something in his
[2:59] mind
[3:03] in Revelations
[3:06] amen then the Holy Spirit
[3:09] the angel of God
[3:12] comes and directions his his voice
[3:16] the rich that comes to speak
[3:25] and during this time
[3:28] amen it's a time for John
[3:31] has seen these things unfold
[3:34] in Revelation
[3:39] yes sir and the angel comes and tells
[3:42] him yes
[3:44] here's what you have to do John you have
[3:48] to take the book because
[3:52] you have to prophesy
[3:59] prophesy again
[4:01] that means
[4:04] that he was going to prophesy
[4:09] that's right
[4:11] it had already been given is that right
[4:15] but he was going to prophesy right here
[4:21] and the
[4:22] prophecya that was to be given yes
[4:34] secret closet Revelations
[4:42] no Revelation that you get
[4:46] and you hide it in your house
[5:12] yes sir
[5:14] that's why this prophecy in this last
[5:18] hour during this time of the rebuilding
[5:22] of this Temple it's a temple is
[5:25] important it's important because we see
[5:28] a health Zechariah Zacharias what they
[5:32] represent
[5:33] during this time of the rebuilding
[5:37] templates
[5:43] these men that are there
[5:47] in the message of Grace
[5:51] we are all acquainted with this
[5:54] scripture
[5:58] he said the ones that read the Bible
[6:01] wow we know that
[6:05] that preparation
[6:08] the restoration of the temples
[6:14] was a great place
[6:17] among the people who had laid the
[6:21] foundation
[6:22] fundamental of the building now I would
[6:26] I want you to put on your spiritual
[6:28] thinking
[6:30] anointing check it off

[6:52] what was the foundations
[7:04] upon who Christ was
[7:36] and he shall bring forth the Cornerstone
[7:44] oh yeah
[7:47] I want you to notice
[7:50] that he never said that he would bring
[7:55] forth the Cornerstone
[7:58] Hallelujah
[8:00] the Cornerstone
[8:04] amen back in the early church
[8:07] is that right man and the former House
[8:12] La Casa Primera is that right man
[8:14] Hallelujah man what does the scripture
[8:16] say he says Amen in Ephesians 2 20. an
[8:21] officials goes by anything is that right
[8:23] I mean yeah the church is founded
[8:26] upon Apostles and Prophets and Jesus
[8:30] Christ being the Chief Cornerstone
[8:35] what he says here like he said he did
[8:38] not say that he was going to bring the
[8:41] Cornerstone
[8:42] he shall bring the headstone

[55:12] he says he said we could see what was
[55:16] where God you have set the angel down
[55:21] he could have let the angel come himself
[55:24] but instead of that but remember he sent
[55:27] the angel and like it to speak through
[55:29] the voice of a man
[55:31] God always uses a man for his work
[55:35] is that right we don't use organizations
[55:39] and so forth Mechanical Devices
