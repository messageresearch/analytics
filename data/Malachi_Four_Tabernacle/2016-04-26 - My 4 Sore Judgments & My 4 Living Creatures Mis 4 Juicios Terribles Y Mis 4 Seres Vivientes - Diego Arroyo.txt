bless you brother amen my it's good to see my cousin amen here and just each one that is in the presence of the Lord amen we believe that God is is alive amen we believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen we believe that uh he is he is in in in leadership leading his people by his word amen the only way that you can know God is to know him by his word you can't know God outside of his word amen amen and someone claims to know God and it it claims to know him in some way outside of the word that is not knowing god because at that day Mark chapter 7 he says depart from me you workers of iniquity never even knew you amen amen so we must know God and he must know us amen amen hallelujah and hallelujah our brother uh Fernando's wife I had see her she was kind of behind there so we welcome everyone amen and we believe that Jesus Christ is still the same today he doesn't change amen he is doing something amen and that something is his promised word hallelujah hallelujah amen there's many things in the scriptures many things in the Bible that were foretold prophesied for this hour amen and we are living in those prophecies see everybody conscience or not they're fulfilling something amen but we as the Church of God we as the bride of Christ we as Sons and Daughters of God filled with the Holy Spirit we must find our place in the word amen and see what we are to do in this hour not unconsciously but consciously walking under the prophecy amen and we're glad to to walk that way amen amen so God bless you let us stand for the reading of the word amen we we're glad to be back uh here in the house of the Lord and uh be able to enter into his word Revelation chapter 6 amen we are in a we've been on a study for the visitors who uh who are just coming in we've been on a study a series going uh detail by detail on the Book of Ezekiel and uh the Lord has really been good to us and we have seen his word very clearly so so we are continuing with that today and I trust that it would be uh clear enough and simple Enough by the Holy Spirit not by human ability but may the Holy Spirit reveal it even to the to the simplest Among Us amen Revelation chapter 6 where we want to begin then we'll be going into the book of eel verse one it says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come in and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bowl and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering to conquer and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see there went out another horse that was red and with and power was given him notice this amen that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword see we find in verse two that it said it was given him a crown it was given him a bow amen amen these are things that someone is giving and that someone is God yes sir amen this God is permitting this because without God's permission the devil cannot do nothing verse five or verse four I'm sorry verse five and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld in low a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand now Wednesday we spoke on the four living creatures and we spoke a little bit about the four uh the four horse riders or the four horses of death right amen and we were showing you how Satan is an imitator and at the end for Armageddon those Four Winds or those those four horses come together and they will bring a disaster a Great Tribulation and a great time of Armageddon and then we saw how the four powers of God the four living creatures these are powers that God uses uh also are coming together in this age and together is going to bring a glorious Rapture he going to bring a glorious Church filled with the glory of God is going to escape these judgments amen amen so notice in this scripture reading we are seeing that each one of these living creatures amen amen is the one that is showing John the seal one of the four beasts saying come and then it said and the second beast said come and see see the third Beast right said come and see see but at the same time he is revealing the black horse see he is revealing the red horse the White Horse so you see him right in the same scripture notice verse six and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the the four beasts saying uh say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see that thou HT not the oil and the wine amen so there is a voice in the midst of the four Beast amen amen the voice is saying touch not the oil and the wine see but the voice is in is is on the throne the voice is in the middle of the four living creatures the four living creatures are surrounding the throne amen amen and The Voice is coming out from the throne amen amen now notice verse seven and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell follow with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword with Hunger with death and with the Beast of the Earth amen Heavenly Father amen we thank you Lord for your word we believe that your word Lord It's Eternal We Believe Lord that it is perfect and in it oh God is Lord the Revelation for us to understand what is going around around going on around us and what is taking place in the world today help us oh god with with your word to understand these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen God bless you I want to uh want to give it as as uh simple as possible and be able to amen be able to enter at least into a portion of it amen and uh be able to to touch a few of these things and we'll continue with it tonight because there's some beautiful things in here uh it's very tremendous and we're just glad to be back and we have a good report amen amen hallelujah from Kentucky and and God is really opening the doors so we just we just want to continue in prayer and believe that he is he is going before us and as long as he's going before us uh we have nothing to fear amen hallelujah we we believe that uh that the same angel of God that led the children of Israel in the form of the pillar of fire in the form of the of of the cloud by day amen is still leading a people today and he's leading us to another land and that land is not physical it's the New Jerusalem the heaven above amen and that is why and whatever he he he tells us and how he wants to direct us we want to follow that amen amen not not uh not caring what what what anybody else might uh anybody else's opinion uh the opinions they fall short to the word of God Amen the word of God is is above every opinion we we want to take the word amen so that is it's beautiful to to just follow the leadership of God and that's what we want to do amen so just I just pray that everybody would be uh ready in preparation and every everything will fall in its place amen you believe that Hallelujah uh it's is not something that we are trying to make happen amen there something that is for ordained of God and when something has been spoken by the mouth of a prophet and a People gives heed to that word the Bible says in the book of Chronicles amen amen fear my servants amen and I will bless you amen honor my prophets and I will prosper you hallelujah amen so you you want to be prospered honor the word of the Prophet because it's not the prophet's word it's the word of the Lord that comes to the prophet and is given to us in this amen touch not my servants do my prophets no harm but if you want to be blessed if you want to be prospered you got to follow the word is that the Bible amen amen uh Joshua chapter 1 amen I will your way will be prosperous amen I will bless you I will be with you I will not leave you I will not forsake you no enemy will be able to stand before you all the days of your life is that right but but why don't let the word to depart from your mouth and from your mind amen you got to stay in the word if you want him to bless you amen amen don't let it depart when only Sundays only Saturdays Every Day Day and Night hallelujah amen meditate in the word day and night glory to God don't let the prophecy of Moses depart from your mind and depart from your mouth speak the word word meditate in the word and walk in the word and he will prosper you amen amen so that's why we give the word its place and when we give the word its place then everything else Falls in its place because what is the place of the word amen the place of the word word is his first place amen amen amen Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you amen seek ye first the kingdom of God and when Jesus came and was manifested in flesh God manifested in flesh he was he was among the Pharisees and the Pharisees were saying oh the kingdom of God is going to come oh we're we're waiting for the Messiah when he comes he's going to destroy the Romans he he he's going to have a great sword and he he he's going to destroy the Roman Empire he's going to kick Herod out out of the out of the Temple amen he's going to kick all pilate out amen amen and they were waiting expecting for him in that way right and when he come he he was Meek amen they spit in his face and and he he not riled back hallelujah amen amen they smoted him and said prophesy who hit you and he shut his mouth they ripped his beard amen they lashed his back they crucified him they mocked him they made fun of him hallelujah amen and and Israel said that's no Messiah that that that's no kingdom of God coming with authority amen amen hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus said the works that I do testify of who I am I'm anointed to set the captives free to give life to him that is dead Amen to Amen to bring Proclaim Liberty the acceptable year of the Lord amen amen he he said and when I do these things when I cast out Devils when when I do these Miracles and these signs it's a sign to you that the Kingdom of Heaven has come so what is the Kingdom of Heaven is the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit was inside of Jesus and he said the kingdom of God is here amen they were waiting for it where's the kingdom where's the kingdom he was standing there in two feet amen he was the very King Of Heaven Hallelujah that come down in human flesh amen he didn't have to wear a crown he didn't have to have a throne he didn't have to wear a robe he was the kingdom of God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and that's why in this hour we must seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness the man didn't even have a place to lay his head he didn't even have a house to go and live in hallelujah amen he brother he didn't even wear he only he only owned one pair of clothes hallelujah amen he didn't have many suits he he didn't have a lot of clothes he didn't have a place to lay his head oh brother but that was God almighty human flesh the the the greatest one of all creation become the most humble Hallelujah he he he he humbled himself so much that no one can humble himself like that because there's no one as great as him you have to be great to humble yourself and the greater you are the more humble you are brother Bram said the the one that that tries to to show that he that he's got something you know like we call it today he likes to flash right he likes to flash oh look at my car look at look at this fine clothes look at this jewelry and all of this that that's the one that probably doesn't have much amen but it's the one that's trying to hide those things amen it's the one that that that that wants to make you feel great amen that's the one brother bam said I've been in palaces of Kings great men and they never tried to presume anything amen they made made me feel like I was the great one oh my like I was the rich one like I was the important one oh my brother that's that's just a a minor thing to what Jesus Christ is brother he he according to his riches and glory amen amen oh my the Bible says all of the gold and all of the silver is mine sayth the Lord hallelujah hallelujah he's the Creator he he created the elements for where they take gold out of Hallelujah he created that stone he created that silver who's richer the one that that takes the stone and makes the gold or the one that created it hallelujah amen amen the Creator is always above creation glory to God and that Creator became my savior amen amen that Creator down Amen to suffer Amen to pay the price of sin that you and I might be saved from the wrath of God amen amen we all sin and come short of the glory of God Amen but he never sinned and him that wasn't sin come down and took the sins of the world upon him to die he become sin when when he wasn't sin so that we that had sin would have no sin hallelujah amen glory to God that's the power of the life of Jesus Christ and it's for you today it's for you if you want to accept it amen it's the greatest love story amen that has ever been wrote amen and it's right here in the Bible his love for you is so great it can't compare with anything hallelujah hallelujah oh Jeremiah said said thus sayth the Lord I have loved you with the eternal love hallelujah hallelujah oh my not a temporal Love Not A Love that lasts one year or two years amen an eternal love glory to God hallelujah amen A Love That Never Ends that never fails that never has has anything Amen in it to diminish that love oh my it gets greater and greater it gets sweeter and sweeter amen do you love him hallelujah hallelujah we love him because he first loved us hallelujah when we were unlovable when when we were unworthy amen when we were filthy and full of sin he still loved us hallelujah amen he he he could look at us and say I can do something with that amen amen I I can make something beautiful out of this right here hallelujah no no matter what the teacher said no matter what the principal said no matter what the officer said when God seen you he said I can do something with this hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I see something precious in this here my predestinated seed is in the heart amen and that's what I'm going to use the power of transformation is already inside of you amen amen in that Gene it's in that Soul it's in that predestination you just got to accept it amen amen and he will do the rest amen do you love him Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Father hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah God hallelujah hallelujah yeah yes Lord amen Amen Hallelujah Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah oh yes Lord Oh my he is beautiful amen he is precious amen hallelujah hallelujah God bless you in this hour oh my how many you know that the Bible will show you your own life you can see your past you can see your present you can see your future right here in the Bible you don't have to go and consult somebody just consult the one who made you amen hallelujah and how do you consult him you go to his word here is his mind here here is his plan and here is your name in mystery form and H in form it's in there but when you find amen your place in the word everywhere you turn then you'll see yourself amen But first you have to find Jesus Christ because he said this is what he said search The Script scriptures for they are they that testify of me amen everywhere in this word it speaks of him but if you are in him amen then it speaks of you too because you're part of him you are his bride you you are the one that is uniting with him hallelujah hallelujah and you can see the messenger of the age Amen in there too see you can see yourself in the word that's why when we're listening to the word when we're hearing the word amen we must apply Faith Hebrews chapter it says the word preached to them did not profit them because they did not apply faith when they heard the preaching amen amen and brother bam said we got to mix faith and when we're hearing the word what we're hearing what we're hearing is the word what we're hearing preach is the word so we got to take that what we're hearing and say yes I believe that I believe that is for me I believe that is possible I believe that God is speaking to me not to somebody else he's speaking to me and and he is telling me what what I what I can receive what he wants from me amen how I must walk how I must live how I must do that's how you listen to the word you don't listen to the word just to see what what part you like Oh I like that part oh that part uh I don't really like that that's not how you listen to the word you don't listen to the word word to see what part you like and what part you don't like you listen to the word conscience that there is a spirit of God behind what is being said amen amen and what's being said is being controlled by the Holy Spirit if if if if I am a true servant of God and not a hypocrite then you can believe that amen amen not because of me brother bam said all we have to do is just surrender ourselves that's a gift amen what is the gift brother bam said the man has to get out of the way amen I didn't plan on saying this amen I didn't plan in saying what I just said these past 10 minutes that wasn't my plan but if you believe in the leadership of the Holy Spirit then you know there's a purpose behind what's being said how many understand say amen amen amen then we got to be conscience of that brother bam said Hebrews 12 when you look what do you see when you when you look to the pulpit he said don't look at the man look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's what we're looking at because what's coming out of here is Jesus what who is Jesus in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so it's not imaginary I'm going to imagine that I'm looking at Jesus no it's not that you're imagining that you're looking at Jesus don't imagine faith is not imagination when you when you look see clearly that you're looking at Jesus in another form and that form is the word hallelujah hallelujah that's the form that you're looking at Jesus is that right glory to God amen how many love himu oh my Hallelujah God help me amen now I I don't know how to get into it amen amen it's okay now notice we read in Revelation chapter 6 we ran where shows up the history in the four first four seals the first seal second seal third seal fourth seal a seal is sealing something right Hallelujah like the seal on the cap of your juice right amen it is sealing what is contained inside of the bottle right amen when you break the seal then you are you have access to what's on the inside but when the seal is still sealed amen amen you can't pour anything out of it you can't partake of what's inside you got to break the seal you understand amen so these seals that the Bible speaks of they were sealing the Bible itself the seals were sealing a a a a Content a a something contained a revelation inside of this Bible amen amen we can go as I as we've done so many times we can go to the book of Isaiah and show you chapter 29 where Jeremiah prophesies and says the book is sealed to everybody even to the ones that go to school to study the scriptures the Bible says that the Bible says that the book The Bible is sealed even to the learned even to the religious even to the ones that have studied and their children children have studied and their children have studied and they have line a family line of of of learned men amen amen that study the scriptures they study the Greek they study the Hebrew they study the history they study all of these things amen amen the Bible says that the Bible itself is sealed to those type of people and then it also says and it's sealed to the to the normal people to the people that is uneducated the people that did not study to the people that is uh you know as what we say common amen amen so it's it's it's not just sealed to the common right amen People Like Us is also sealed to the learning and people in the religious World they they have in their mind in denominations and in religions they have in their mind that if you want to know the the the the the content of the Bible you have to study you have to go to school and you have to hear a professor tell you what what this means and the professor amen is teaching you what somebody taught him right the professor of that Bible College amen has spent years of his life learning what somebody else has interpreted to know what this Bible is and that someone else found it on his own amen amen but the Bible says it is of no private interpretation so you can't privately say well I think that this part of the Bible means this right I think that's what it means so that's what it is no just because that's what you think it is doesn't mean that's what it is the author has put it there for a reason and it has a true meaning and a true interpretation and that's why we believe in the prophet of God amen amen because the Bible says in Amos chapter 3 verse that he these Mysteries and these secrets that are inside of the he reveals them to his the Prophet The Prophet is the one that is telling you what the Lord says that's why he has thus saith the Lord not thus sayth the prophet not thus sayth so and so thus sayth the professor amen no thus sayith the Lord so when we look at that we understand that there was a promise and that it was that this Bible was going to be opened these seals were going to be broken by Jesus Christ himself he was going to break the seal amen amen and and the content he was going to give it to his Prophet Hallelujah you understand so that content amen is the book itself you got to eat the book you got to eat the content that's inside you understand and then you begin to speak amen amen the the con content but where did you get it from you got it from a hand that come down from heaven is that what Ezekiel did amen amen did he receive it from a professor did he receive it from somewhere no brother this is coming from the Throne of God this message comes from the Throne of God Amen Hallelujah and it begins to reveal and unfold what these things really are not what a theologian thinks not what a professor said about 500 years ago no no no no this is revelation from God given to a prophet in this age as promised in the Bible to reveal all of these things and he begins to tell us see the the seal means this this fourth Beast right here this these four living creatures this is what they mean and you'll find them in Genesis you'll find them in Exodus you'll find them in Isaiah you'll find them in Ezekiel you'll find them in Jeremiah you'll find them in Zarah you'll find them in the four gospels amen you'll find them in the Book of Revelation who knows that where did that come from how do we know these things it come from God Amen you understand this is I'm trying to simplify it so you can understand that this this is not something that we're just you know kind of just saying or or or repeating brother this it has to be revealed amen and God has brought to us that Revelation how many are thankful for that how many are thankful for this message hallelujah hallelujah amen amen this is precious this is more than this is more than gold amen I'm we're willing to give our life and everything for this word this is not just a religion to say yeah you know this this is what I do as my religion it's my hobby you know and then I have my own life aside of My Religion amen this is not that that this is the life of the of the word living inside of you is the only way that you can live the life of the word no other way it's not a covering it's not a religion it's a life that has to live inside of you and that produces according to its God that gives fruits now notice so we find that these four horses of death the White Horse the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse were being identified by the four living creatures who was identifying horse is a beast which in the Bible represents a power amen it's a power and this power is of Satan but is being given to us as a symbol of what this power represents how it works what it does and we see that the one that is opening this is the four living creatures this is powerful because it says says that when one of the seals open amen amen the first living creature was telling John come and see this so John is being able to see and and and write what is written here because the living creature is opening it to him amen amen you understand and the second and the third and the fourth see so in the in the first one we see that he comes with cunningness amen he is religious but he has something under under his sleeve right amen and then we begin to see in in in the second phase that he has he is given power right amen he is giving a power to take peace from the earth and they that they should kill one another and there was given to him a great sword amen amen then the next horse is showing us famine amen he he he is breaking the the economics of the world he has been given power to do this that there that that there be hunger that they would charge for prayers and stuff like that and then we begin to see how that uh he has a pair of balances in his hand the balances in the hand always have to do with buying and selling you find that in the Book of Genesis when Abraham was to buy property he had the balances in his hand he was going to pay the price for the for for the land amen where he was going to be buried where he was going to bury Sarah amen every body else is going to be buried there he had a balance that means he was going to he was going to buy and there was somebody selling so that's what balances mean amenu was there balances in the temple in the days of Jesus amen amen did they have balances amen did they have merchandise outside of the temple amen where they selling pigeons and Lambs right were they making business amen outside of the temple did they have balances amen they have money changers I I I don't have change oh we have money changers amen don't worry amen we can change from dollars to V Euros whatever you want right here we have money changers amen maybe you have Egyptian money maybe you have uh uh you know who knows uh Babylonian money we have the Changers right here amen they they'll give you Jerusalem money right you you got Rome see you have Changers here see brother sister that was taking place in the temple is that right Jesus came amen he he took some some some a pair of ropes amen and begin to whip people outside of the temple the lovely Jesus amen amen full of merciful and and and and love and tenderness amen begin to whip people outside of the temple and kick them out amen and turning over their tables amen all the change falling everywhere amen open up opening up the cages of the of the doves and letting them loose amen whipping the the the the sellers and anybody would get in between hallelujah hallelujah what did the Bible say the Zeal of my father's house has consumed me oh brother hallelujah amen that was that was in The Book of Psalms that was a prophecy even that action that Jesus did there was a prophecy in the scriptures the heal my father's house amen has consumed me oh brother he begin to bring order Amen in the local assembly amen glory to God Amen he begin to do the work of a deacon amen hallelujah he begin to whip people he begin to say you can't do this here this is not permitted this is a House of Prayer amen it's not a house to sell things it's not a din of Thieves you have no business doing that here get out of here amen amen see you begin to put things in order hallelujah amen amen you see balances represent buying and selling that's how we got into that Hallelujah but the fourth seal the fourth Beast says come and see and now when he sees he sees the horse of a of a color of pale which is a a combination of the white the red and the black together amen pale is that mixture you understand hallelujah amen brother Jesus can tell you about that right make some colors together make your own colors right amen so now notice when you look at this it is showing you that this power has the power all of the power that the other beasts had it has the power of the White Horse it has the power of the red horse that has the power of the of the black horse all combined together amen amen and this it it gives its name and the name is death and shows you that hell is open and Hell comes out to follow this power amen and then it says that power is given him over the fourth part of the earth notice to kill with the sword that's what the red one had and with Hunger that's what the black one had right amen and with death see that's how death came in by the white one the serpent using the word religious see amen and with the beasts of the earth now the reason we have taken already some time there is because when you go to the book of of Ezekiel turn with me to ezel 14 Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord when you go to the Book of Ezekiel you'll find that there's something taking place in this part of of the history of the book that there is something taking place similar to what is taking place now because Revelation chapter 6 is is the mystery of the church ages the first four seals is revealing to you what was taking place in the spiritual realm during seven Church ages that was from the days of Paul the Apostle that was the first Messer to the first age all the way through seven ages to this last age the age of Leia where the last messenger William brandham William Bram was going to be the messenger amen amen to the Gentile world to bring the consummation of all the mystery of God and until the seventh angel according to Revelations 10:7 was going to be given the whole revelation of this mystery because it says when he begins begin to preach his message that mystery that was always hid is going to be made known it's going to be finished amen amen you see that so how many understand that the first second third and fourth seal is the history or the mystery behind the history of the seven Church ages amen because in in these seven Church ages there was sent to the church from God God sent anointing to anoint the church and his spirit is also symbolized as a as a power his spirit God's spirit is also symbolized as a beast as a power a lion amen an ox amen amen a man and an eagle so God's power is also symbolized being sent to the church to coun attack these horses amen amen the the lion power for the White Horse the the the ox power amen for the red horse the man power for the Black Horse and the eagle power for the Pale Horse amen they're in combat it's a it's a battle amen but we are in the last part of that how many know that we are we at the end of the ages amen amen yes we're at the end of the world we're at the end of time and the end of History we're at the end we're at the end of the ages have the seventh angel gave his message amen then where we're at brother bam said the seventh angel gives his message at the End of the Age oh my not at the beginning at the end so where are we at amen amen are those things that those three horses did still taking place today those three beasts those three horses are are what they did over there are they still doing it now but in a modern way yes sir is Satan still religious in other words does he still act like he like he's he's a he's uh from God Amen he he dresses himself with light oh he's humble he's Meek and and he's religious he's a good person amen amen does he still act like that yes sir today 2016 amen amen he's still he's still the same but behind the scenes see not out openly but behind the scenes he still has in him that red horse he's still killing amen amen he's still enforcing he still taking peace from the earth who do you think was behind World War I and behind World War I amen that religious power amen amen religious power is behind Wars amen amen they're political and they're religious and he also is still controlling the economy of the earth more now than what he did back then amen Oh my he has control of the wealth of the world see satanic power she's the mother of all Abominations she sits on seven h Hill and she is a woman a woman represents a church and the Seven Hills the Bible says that the Seven Hills where she sits on is the city where she dwells Hallelujah so there's a city with Seven Hills in the in the country of Italy but it's its own country amen amen it has his own King it has its own economy it has its own jurisdiction has his own Court how many know that amen and that city is the city of Rome so notice that this is still in control so these four or these three powers are mixed into one now amen amen amen and right there is where we're at see Ezekiel 14 says this we're going to read from verse 12 the word of the Lord came again to me saying son of man when the land sinth Against Me by trespassing grievously then will I stretch out my hand upon it and I will break the staff of bread thereof and will and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and Beast from it who is saying that God is saying I'm going to do this people today say just the other day right brother Enrique the the woman at the at the job where we're working uh the lady that cleans the house she said hey hey Pastor well if there's a God and why does he permit all of this amen that's right why is there Wars why is there hunger listen to the Bible we're reading the Bible the Bible says I will do this who's the ey God I will bring famine amen amen I will cut off the people from the earth I will cut off the beast from the earth why because they sin and trespass against me see people think that the god of the Bible don't exist no more that that was just for the old times the Bible says Malachi 3 I am God and I change not Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you got to follow his word amen amen hallelujah he's a god of love but he's a god of judgment Hallelujah a god of righteousness and to have righteousness you need a law amen and you going have to have penalty for that law imagine if there was no law here in the city amen what would it be like there is Law and look at it what about without law 10 times worse laws for purpose is to set order amen amen is that right it has its place as long as it's in the word when it gets outside of the word it doesn't have no place there's a greater law above that like Jesus told pilot you have no power over me except what's given to you from above see amen that that's the mind of Christ am amen whatever power they have is given to them from above but if the power that they are trying to exercise is not given from above it's got to be given from somewhere else amen that's devil now notice here it says in verse 14 though these three men knowah Daniel and job were in it they should be but deliver their own Souls by their transgression righteousness I'm sorry saith the Lord God if I cause noisome Beast to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the Beast though these Beast three men though these three men were in it as I live sayith the Lord God they shall deliver neither Sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate or if I bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that I cut off man and Beast from it though these three men were in it as I live say the Lord they shall deliver neither son or daughter but they only shall be delivered themselves or if I send a pestilence into the land and pour out my Fury upon it in blood my to cut off from it man and beasts though Noah Daniel and job were in it as I live sayith the Lord God they shall deliver neither son or daughter they shall but deliver their own Souls by their righteousness this is an individual fa amen is that right it's an individual Affair not because Noah was there or or or job or Daniel Amen like in Sodom is the world in a Sodom condition yes sir remember Abraham oh if there be 40 Lord if there be 30 Lord if there be 20 Lord if there be 10 will will you spare the Judgment no sir is that right amen and there was three see four but one turned into salt amen so only three is that right and not not those three could save the city from the wrath of God yes sir and and look what God is showing Ezekiel here he is going to bring the sword right he is going to bring the pestilence he is going to bring the famine he is going to bring these things but he's going to he's going to give that power to somebody that's why these four beasts these four horses in in the Genesis uh Revelation chapter 6 it says it was given to him a crown it was given to him a bowl it was given to him a sword it was given to him power to take peace from the earth who's giv him that power God in his righteous judgment amen because he has a plan and that plan is going to come to fulfillment that's what people don't understand God's plan's got to come to fulfillment and for it to be fulfilled amen he has to bring certain things Amen to play the people of Israel in the days of Ezekiel they are rebellious against God the temple is full of Idols they're worshiping the sun they're worshiping Tomo amen they're worshiping ba they're worshiping the as amen amen they're worshiping all of these foreign Gods Amen in the temple of Jerusalem where they're only to worship Jehovah God because Jehovah said my name will be there I am the Lord that is my Dwelling Place I dwell in Jerusalem I live among my people amen amen make offerings unto me amen come and praise my name come with joy amen that's my place of worship my glory my sh Glory dwells in that Temple and then in that Temple where my Glory dwells you want to bring worship of Idols in that Temple where I am worshiped you want to worship some foreign God amen amen you want to commit Abominations in my temple and I have sent my Prophet Jeremiah to prophesy and condemn these works that you're doing and what did you do to Jeremiah you stoned him what did you do to Jeremiah you rejected him but when Hanah gave a prophecy oh yes blessed Bishop Hanah amen the Lord speaks through him is that right what did Brother bam say Amen in the message anointed ones at the end time he said look at Jeremiah and Hanah amen a true prophet and a false prophet both Anointed with the spirit of God but one had a false prophecy one had the word of the Lord amen amen oh brother Jeremiah said because of your Rebellion because of your worship and Idols because you've turned from the Lord and I'm a prophet ordained to the Nations to go seven times around the world I tell you you will be in captivity for 70 years th sayth the Lord before that it was repent judgment is coming you still have a chance amen repent you still have a chance but then the hour come where he said they'll never rise again say the Lord their day of Grace has gone by 70 years he'll be in captivity what did Hanah do ananiah came out said no thus sayth the Lord two years Israel will be in captivity and the Mighty God will bring them back to the land who had thus sayith the Lord Jeremiah saying 70 Hanah says two years amen what did they do to hand anah read the Bible oh brother they gave him money they gave him a great position oh Bishop anah Hallelujah we like your prophecies Jeremiah man you know 70 years brother he had already prophesied of these things and Ezekiel was living in this time do you understand so when you spurn God's mercy amen amen he's going to use someone or he's going to use something Amen to bring some some judgment and in this case he gave power he gave the sword he he gave authority to Nebuchadnezzar God did yes God rose up Nebuchadnezzar with power and great Army amen and he gave him sword he gave him Authority God Almighty for a purpose cuz he has a plan Nebuchadnezzar is not his people amen am Babylon is not his people but he'll use somebody like that to bring judgment to his people oh my yes sir because he loves his people amen he has a purpose for his people he has a plan for his people amen amen he knows why he does what he does oh my and in this hour brother and through the church ages he gave power to these systems to these beasts he allowed it that's God's permissive will amen amen but it's working for his perfect how many understand that look at verse 21 for thus say the Lord God how much more when I send my four sword judgments upon Jerusalem the sword the famine the noisome Beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and Beast amen you see what he's doing what did we read in the book of reev the same things God works in continuity the days of Ezekiel brother was the end of those ages it was the end where now there was going to come all four judgments all four horses together to bring judgment in one time how many understand that that the same thing is here again horse is all four together Amen to bring this judgment and what is there going to be brother Ezekiel when that judgment came to eel wasn't touched Hallelujah amen amen hallelujah Ezekiel was safe in the arms of God amen amen he wasn't touched brother you understand how many understand we're barely getting into it right now and I got to and I got to close but are you seeing the picture amen you seeing the picture in these days of Ezekiel the church the of God Israel were going against God they were being rebellious against God and because God loves the church amen Amen brother bam said he'll loose the devil in the local church to see what going to do amen see your reaction amen amen see if you're going to stand on the word or you're going to be carnal minded oh this church I'm never coming back here again depends on what mind State you're in amen amen depends if you're on the word if you know amen how God works yes sir he permits things he lets things happen to see am man the reactions yes sir and in this case he's going to allow Babylon to come and destroy and kill why because they have rejected the glory of God brother they had the glory right there in the temple brother they they they should have appreciated that amen amen they should have appreciated that they were God's people that no other Nation had the glory of God like they had no other people had the pillar of fire no other people they should have a PRI appreciated what they had but they didn't they said yeah we we have the glory of God yeah it's okay you know but I like this right here I like this Idol I want to know more about this the son God maybe maybe this over here I like this a little better let me waste my time and these other stupidities hallelujah amen repent brother God the time came where he sent forth the judgment and he said four severe judgments four sore judgments I'm sending amen amen is that right Hallelujah now look but that people was divided into certain groups and there was three groups how many know that in every age there's three groups of people there's the elected there's the church falling away and then there's the world the sin amen well Ezekiel chapter 5 shows us this and Ezekiel is a sign how many remember that he is a sign he is representing all of the people of Israel and is representing like John all of the Bride but notice in Ezekiel chapter 5 I'm not going to read it to save us time God tells Ezekiel take a razor a knife amen amen and shave your head in three parts amen take one part amen and from your beard and your head which represents the people that live in Jerusalem amen amen the hair was representing the people that live in Jerusalem take a portion of that amen and and and and burn it with fire turn take another portion of it amen and cut it up amen take another portion of it and Scatter it into the wind amen see God was showing here that this this judgment that was coming from Babylon he was going to do these things to the people but there was a remnant there was going to be a a certain elected group that were going to be saved from all of these things amen and Ezekiel was part of that how many you understand amen so I told you I was going to go slow amen that's okay so that we could understand but at the end of this age at the end of Lea the conditions of the church would be in the same condition that Israel was in the days of Ezekiel amen amen they were they they are a rebellious house a rebellious house he tells Ezekiel go prophesy to this rebellious house they're in Rebellion rebell against God amen amen uh did you know that the sin of rebellious is as witchcraft amen amen yes sir that's that's what the Bible says when you rebel against God brother it's as witchcraft yes sir because you're under an enchantment amen amen of the devil yes sir and that enchantment has you in Rebellion against God Amen you don't know why you don't know how but you just don't you want to rebel amen if God says this you want to do contrary if God says you know this brother you want to do contrary brother you're under an Enchantment of the Devil Himself yes sir Rebellion is witchcraft the Bible says amen and you know what God speaks about the witches and wizards in the Bible amen you can go to the book of Deuteronomy and see what happens to them oh my brother God God knows knows what he is doing but notice here in in in the Bible this is a rebellious house and this rebellious house amen is under the Enchantment of the devil and they're worshiping Idols you you can read that even in the days of Jeremiah amen he was shown by God amen what was inside of the temple and what they were worshiping you can read that in Jeremiah 32 and you see God showing Jeremiah that they had Mok amen they would burn sacrifices of sons and daughters unto Mo amen amen and they and they would have other gods in there and Jeremiah brother amen he blasted that thing with the word amen he told him th say the Lord amen wrath judgment is coming upon you repent and turn to God Amen but they brother under that enchantment they didn't want to stop that they they want to continue and continue and continue there was only a a a a a number of people only an elected people that got out of that enchantment and were raised up to the same level that the Prophet Jeremiah was in and then God begin to show them the same things that he showed Jeremiah huj he begin to show Ezekiel amen let's go to the temple Ezekiel and Ezekiel was led in the spirit to the temple and and God opens the door and in the vision Ezekiel comes into the temple and sees the idol of jealousy amen the first thing he sees in the temple jealousy brother that is of the devil that was up there with Lucifer and Michael that jealousy come from Satan and in it was in his son Cain wasn't Cain jealous amen ofel yes sir that jealousy runs all down through the Bible that's why they killed the prophets that's why they killed Jesus amen jealousy yes sir and then and Ezekiel begins to see and the Lord shows him that there is a wall there but he tells them to dig in the wall and inside of the wall there's a door that that they don't show it's a hidden door a secret door amen amen and when that door is open amen he begins to see abomination inside of the temple yes sir eel is seeing the same things that Jeremiah saw Jeremiah in Jeremiah 32 saw all these things and prophesied against it Ezekiel in Ezekiel chapter 8 Ezekiel chapter n and Ezekiel chapter he's in the same vision that Jeremiah was in seeing the same Abominations seeing the same things amen amen and giving forth the final voice that Jeremiah already gave oh brother sister Hallelujah not just by repetition like a parrot no sir no but he's he is in repetition by the spirit because he's in the same vision like Jeremiah he's in the same realm like Jeremiah he's not just repeating what Jeremiah said he's in the same vision like Jeremiah he's under the same anointing like Jeremiah that's the difference the difference is the anointing the difference is the vision that what you're seeing is what you're prophesying and that word has life hallelujah it's like the same thing when brother Bram showed us what the name was he said the name is life the name is a life inside of you and that name has power amen that name being used by a son of God in his position it's different than somebody using the name not in the same Condition it's different yes sir remember the seven sons of saba they said we adure you in the name of Jesus Christ who Paul preached they said who are you who are you they were using the name yes sir of Jesus Christ they were using the name of the messenger of that age but it had no power brother bam said it doesn't matter how much you can scream at the Devil you can pour oil on it you can do all this they recognize Authority that life behind the name hallelujah amen that's what counts brother if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given you that's the difference amen as we come to close here we're closing and we haven't even started but I got to close brother B says here in the in the God of this evil age amen children of Disobedience Rebellion what does Disobedience mean he says look I looked it up in the dictionary it means Rebellion Disobedience means Rebellion Rebellion against what against the revealed word of God hello somebody Hallelujah Rebellion Rebellion is rebelling against the revealed word of God like Cain rebelled against Abel's revealed Revelation Vindicated of God that it was righteousness Cain rebelled against it and slew his brother the Pharisees with their own denominational knowledge of what the word was selected handpicked men rebelled against the Vindicated word of God manifested for their day Jesus Christ himself and they killed him is that right who were they the children of Disobedience Allelujah Rebellion against the word of God see see where they are today days of Miracles has passed Jesus Christ is not the same yet there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of that stuff is nonsense see Rebellion they don't they don't stay to they don't they don't have to say two things they just have to say one and that that's Rebellion they can't say you don't have eyes you don't have ears you've got to take the whole body the whole word see what is it God cannot be mocked don't worry amen amen God is Not mocked man will reap what they sold they can't Mock and make fun and say these things that they say and get away with it like bread upon the Water it will return she the devil's bride wrapped in his religious sin knowledge of this present age to deceive you a whole click or denomination of seducing Spirits by scientific knowledge modern civilization where watch where we're going to go in a few minutes he says now brother sister is showing us amen that the this this Spirit of rebellion exists in this evil age amen amen the God of this evil age amen is controlling the children of disobedience it's a rebellious house that has heard the revealed word of God that has been Vindicated by a pillar of fire Vindicated to be the truth and Rebellion against that amen amen is Children of Disobedience amen now notice he says children of Disobedience see in the beginning in the infancy of Disobedience what will it be when it comes to the person of the Antichrist there will be a power of deception an adult can give to the world but an infant child see the spirit of delusion now working in the children of Disobedience disobedient to what to the word now he says do you know that your beginning I can prove to you he says by the Bible that you were in your great grandfather and you were produced down to your grandfather then your father and then you you know that the Bible said in Hebrews 7 when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings paid tides to mzc amen Levi who receives Tides paid ties in the loin of Abraham when he met mzc so whatever Abraham did we find that Levi was then in Abraham you see it's predestination and in these messages I want to emphasize the things that I have told you in the message in this evening light that God said would come upon the Earth and that the Beast that would come upon the Earth would deceive all whose names were not in the Lamb's Book of Life slain before the foundation of the world in God's Own thinking in in the beginning did you know you were in him hallelujah hallelujah now notice the church refused to to accept God's word to rule over them see they crucified Jesus we we all believe that because we're looking back to see what happened Their Eyes Were blinded and we can look back and see what was but if that world is the same now this present evil age that we have been back in time to do the same thing that they're doing today because it's still the same word for this age being made manifest they can't do nothing else they are children of Disobedience given to strong delusion to believe a lie and to be damned by it then brother B continues it says the children of Disobedience and the children of obedience have nothing in common the children of Disobedience and the children of obedience one is in night in darkness of this evil age and the other is in light Hallelujah the others in the age of Darkness nightclubs dances and yet belongs to church and it's okay with their God they don't have any condemnation about it nothing bothers them it's okay they can do that and still serve God it don't condemn me to do this it don't condemn me to cut my hair it don't hurt my conscience amen see oh my certainly not she don't have what a conscience is it sear so hard till she don't even know what it is see now notice but the sons of God are different but they have a form of godliness denying the power from such turn away hallelujah hallelujah now notice brother in the first SEAL stand to your feet brother bam says that when he was showing him this this this horse rider this Spirit of Judas that went out to to deceive amen amen to deceive he told John come over here let me show you I have something to show you I would not that you be ignorant about the spirit of antichrist the spirit of antichrist works in the children of Disobedience and that's where it begins in the form of nian spirit and from there it evolves into the crowning and the and the Beast hallelujah hallelujah now notice brother why are we going into this children Disobedience thing here why we why are we coming to this place because we want to show you that is Ezekiel is seeing the the house of Israel in Rebellion amen amen they are a rebellious house rebellious to what to the revealed word given to them by the Prophet Jeremiah brother to reject the word for the age there is nothing left amen amen but judgment oh my oh my that's a strong thing because the the the Bible tells us amen amen that that same life of Jesus Christ was going to return to do the same works again in this last age and to reject it amen it would put you as a candidate for the judgments that are coming upon the Earth brother when this tribulation begins upon the earth oh brother sister there's going to be some horrible WRA amen coming and striking the Earth yes sir there's going to be persecution there's going to be death you cannot buy you cannot sell unless you're part of the system L to God brother sister these things that are prophesied of in the scripture in the days of Ezekiel is where we're at right now we're in the same position that Ezekiel was in the Bible we're in the same position that that was in the Bible to show us today how we must act how we must be how we must live look at Ezekiel and you'll find out he was saved from from that wrath he wasn't killed like the rest of Israel he was in God's safety he was under the protection of God because he accepted God's provided way to escape from the wrath of God and that was a message revealed by a prophet and he received that and came up into the same realm hallelujah hallelujah oh brother sister oh Hallelujah that is where we're at in this hour amen amen there's there's rebellion in the in the people of the church they hear the word they know the word they have the knowledge of the truth and yet knowing that it's okay if you don't know God can forgive you God can can show you Mercy amen amen and even if you do know and you do it amen God's your judge amen amen he might permit it to you like he did Israel he'll give you a warning then he'll give you another warning another warning amen you already know you know the word you know the what Jeremiah said but if you continue in rebellion and that which craft is not broken from you oh brother sister there is wrath amen amen Hebrews chapter 6 amen a a a horrible judgment expectation yes sir is that what the Bible says after you have received the knowledge of the truth see amen the knowledge of the truth you know what the truth is amen Hebrews chapter 10 and then after you receive the knowledge of the truth amen you you turn again amen against the word see then there is there is no more sacrifice amen amen there's no nothing else and that's exactly where that that that time of Ezekiel was because brother once Ezekiel begins to see the reason why God is leaving them the reason why God is permitting this the reason why he's bringing Babylon there's got to be a reason there's an apostasy taking place amen the man of sin cannot be revealed until the first be an apostasy amen the church allows this to happen why because of their condition amen amen amen their condition amen amen forces God to permit this you understand God God God can do nothing the church in this condition amen amen God has to let this judgment go for severe judgments come and swipe the land famine hunger Terrible Things death no peace because the people that are supposed to bring peace to the Earth the the people that are supposed to cry out amen amen and confess their sins and God will come down and heal the land Hallelujah they're not doing that they're in another condition and because of that God sends this wrath how many are understanding amen why are they rebellious because they have heard they have received enough knowledge of the word of the Lord and still they're rebellious against it that is the condition that Ezekiel will see in the church in amen and what did he what did he see the glory of God glory raise up from the Cherub the glory of God that was in upon The Mercy Seat where the cherubs are amen where the blood was sprinkled once a year in the temple the glory that was always there since the days of Moses in the wilderness the glory came in and filled the house Solomon built the the temple amen and the glory filled the house amen since that time the glory was always there but Ezekiel sees that that Glory lifts up from The Mercy Seat that's the only way that wrath can come Hallelujah but at the same time that that Glory that lifts us lifts up from there comes inside inside of Ezekiel Hallelujah Hallelujah it comes upon another Mercy Seat it comes inside of a people in this last day amen that's where the glory is the glory has lifted up and brother Bram said let me read this quote in closing as our brother plays Softly knoweth it not he's speaking of how he tries to warn the people try to tell women how they must act they don't want it the Bible tells you how they don't want it he says I try to it's like a doctor that has the medicine and tries to pour it down the person's mouth but still they spit it out and the doctor tries to put his hand over their mouth so they won't spit it out and they still they spit it in between his [Music] fingers he said you cannot blame the doctor people blame God all the time amen M you can't blame the medicine but the attitude of the person amen it'll be a horrible day one of these days when this sinful adulterous generation stands before almighty God I see my [Music] years creeping up my my shoulders stooping [Music] 33 years on the field a long life 33 years of service and I don't regret I don't have one regret this might be my last opportunity while here in this Mortal to preach the gospel God help me to stand true as true can be to that word says notice Methodist women Pentecostal women you tell them shouldn't wear this you shouldn't do that to your head you shouldn't do this or that women that claim to be Christian they should know better they're rebellious watch what brother man says here he says the higher you rise in God the more sinful the whole thing looks and then sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the Holy Spirit take you up into a sphere then the whole thing looks chaos and then you come back down and it seemed like to the people that you're a rascal you're nothing but an old sarcastic you're a fool because you stand as an old crank always rebuking the [Music] people but if you ever climb into them spheres one time where you can be in the presence of God not through emotion but through the genuine Holy Spirit lifting you up then you will see that the whole thing is wrote the glory of the Lord has Departed from the whole denominational outfit that's right there is none of them that is [Music] right Ezekiel Saw all these Abominations they saw the glory lift up when the glory [Music] departs it means the glory of the Lord has departed but where does it go it has to go somewhere the Bible says that in this day he was going to shake everything hallelujah amen he was going to shake the heavens he was going to shake the Earth yes sir brother he was going to shake everything is that right Hai chapter [Music] 2 verse six for thus sayith the Lord hope of hosts yet once it will is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the Earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory sayth the lord of hosts the silver is mine the Gold is mine sayth the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter
