they're passing laws of homosexuality they're teaching my children how to do anal sex in the grade can I say more I can't take it no more I can't take it no longer Sarah that's got to get to that point where is the system of this world is putting pressure on the word and because she and the word are one she can't take it no more she speaks and her word hallu he says this lets us know that the hatred and the blasphemy of Satan against the true Christian will be vented through a group who are false Christians who will and this this will increase until God uproots the false Hallelujah pulls her out brother that's going to happen one of these days naturally but what I'm telling you what I was trying to tell you this morning is that this is already happening spiritually right now brother

it showing you that the l r is here and when the letter rain is here is for a change for a quickening power that's what ened Sarah to give her faith to speak the word and her word was the scripture amen amen amen look what he says in the spoken words the original se he says I'm going to visit you I personal proun I'm going to visit you according to the time of life you're going to have that baby that you waited on the latter rain is fixing the fall Hallelujah you have hold that seed in there long enough now believe you're looking for a coming son amen that's the real church today you're looking for a coming son coming the real church today the elected seed you've been looking for him I'm going to send him to you that's the word oh you say that wasn't the word he says I beg your pardon Abraham called him Elohim El and Elohim El in Genesis 18:14 said I will return according to the time of life and I will visit Sarah in Genesis 21 the Bible says the Lord visited Sarah and that visitation are you with me is the latter that visitation is the dyamic power to move this bride to move this church to move her into writing the book of act to stop this but they cannot stop it deep down and it's from the from the rivers of life she is the Tree of Life on the Earth again and whoever eats of this will not die Hallelujah whoever needs of this will not die because this is the time that the is eating from that book from that bread that came down from heaven 1963 and if the water that was once bitter amen the things that were once bitter the word was bitter the preacher was bitter the people were bitter The Message Church was SP religious people that's that's the law that's M Hallelujah that's the old coven that's the old another it's theen from Heaven not theen of the Earth it's the Cen from over there from eternity and that bitterness that was in the church that bitterness that was in me that bitterness that is in still in some people hallelujah hallelujah when they crossed the Red Sea and God did wonderful work and they said oh Moses the water is better yeah in 1963 the Tree of Life came down and he threw the Tree of Life in the one Bitter Water the water became Sweet godu Sweet Water this water sweet now I drink the water it's not bitter it's sweet water and if this water is still bitter to you it's because you need the tree ofet to sweeten up your life brother it's too bitter I I I don't get no taste out of it I don't get no taste out of what what is being said the Tree of Life see how taste after that see look what he says make no mistake look what I am saying it's the grace of God for this church in this last hour Sarah he could have killed her a long time ago he could have destroyed but Amazing Grace has kept her until this time she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word of Hallelujah huj she is in another form he said the former rain the planting rain now what happened the former rain was being planted the latter rain fell and what happened when the latter r fell something happened Sodom and it sodomites were burned but Adam Abraham received the promised son the latter r fell brother in Genesis inis Hallelujah and when fell sodomites were burned and Adam Abraham received the promised son let me ask you something did our Abraham did he receive the promised word I'm talking spiritual now I'm talking about what's happening right now did he receive the opening of the seals Hallelujah did the promised son come Jesus Christ down from heaven the mighty angel with a book in his hand open and he come down who was that Jesus Christ who was that the promised son who was that God himself who was that El who was that the word did he come that shows you something that shows you something how this is in connection remember we said this morning remember we said this morning when Isaac was born is was 14 years old listen when Sarah spoke said cast out the b and her child it was and I gave you the scriptures this morning after Isaac was weaned from the milk which was about two years is what is known that's about the time for them in that time and I think even for Jews today that the mother wngs their child stops giving two years two years and why is that significant why is that significant because understand what I'm saying that came the promised son came when when the denominational ages had reached 14 years reach 14 ages and in 1963 when the word come and the book was open denominational Ages were over is that right but that's when he was born but two years later something happened M hallelujah hallelujah hello Hallelujah that would be 1965 at the end of 1965 something happened brother if the prophet ain't taken off to she we still have a bunch of babies today it's true brother that is true God had to take him off of the scene when that happens listen when that happens the promised latter rain was going to multip what had already been laid in the word not understanding when we go to Joel amen we're going to read two scriptures verse 23 be glad you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately he will call to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month what's the first month for for the Jews the Bible says right here to s first the former rain and the latter rain in the first month what is the first month ail in the spring time in the resurrection time in the Harvest Time that right amen the harest time ail what was going to happen the floor shall be full of wheat amen the V shall overflow with b and oil and I will restore to you the year that the Locust have eaten T caterpillar my arm and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied praise the name of the Lord your God that dwy with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen amen amen verse 15 now I pray you consider from this day and upward from before A Stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord since those days where when one came to heat of 20 measures and there were but two when one came to the pressat for to draw out 50 vessels out of the press and there were but 20 you understand before that day there was a lack when they would come to the Press fat which was the place where the oil was supposed to be flowing there were supposed to be 50 vessels which is Jubilee vessels Jubilee time being poured out they didn't have it there was only 20 then what he says I smoke you with the blasting and the milk do with the hell and all the labors of your hands yet you turn not to me sayth the Lord consider now from this day and upward Hallelujah from the 4 and 20th day of the the n9th month even from the day that day that the Lord that the foundation of the Lord's Temple was laid consider it December 24th 1965 two years after Isaac was born something happened amen hello now you understand a little better 1963 the shields were open was born the word was born two years later December the nth month the 24th day that day forward something going to happen something's going to happen is the seed yet in the barn yay as the yet the vine and the Fig Tree the pomegranate and the Olive Tree have not brought not brought forth from this day I will bless amen amen from this day I will bless you amen amen your floors shall be full of wheat your back shall overflow with wine and oil I will restore sayth the Lord because in this time brother you got to see the spiritual sense of what I'm trying to tell you from that day forward something was going to change the of Christ there had to be something that this message what's going to do for you and me and it had to be from the time the prophet is taken off the December 24th when brother B passed from this life to the next yes where he's waiting to come back amen oh oh yes this time something is happening the Vats are overflowing before that day they would come to see the flowing of the oil there was nothing there would come for wine and there was nothing you understand what I'm saying Amen brother the time had to come with Sarah when that separation takes place when ISAC was weaned from the breast two years later he born then is was cast out then the separation truly for message people and Pentecostals was made yeah preached it too that's when people really begin to follow the message that's when people really begin to have message churches you understand amen when the prophet was off the scene they said oh he was a prophet of God he called us out of denomination now we have message church now we have churches of the message but it had to be after he's gone while he was here there was no message churches there were sister churches the only message church was the Tabernacle and then in 1965 on Tabernacle yes sir amen but other than that brother there was no other church but from there come message churches message people for a purpose for that this restoration of the brid could come full totality you understand For What so that Sarah speak the word we can say many more things amen amen stand your feet t
