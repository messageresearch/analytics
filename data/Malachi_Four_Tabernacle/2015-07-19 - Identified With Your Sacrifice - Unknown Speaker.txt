the word should not be spoken to them anymore we have not been brought to this they could not endure that which was commanded if so much that as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned and thrust through with a so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake here come unto Mount Zion amen and into the city of the Living God to the Heavenly Jerusalem and to innumerable company of Ang to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to the god of the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and the blood of the sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel revelation 22 two verses of scripture Revelation apyp chapter 22 verse 16 I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the Bright Morning Star the spirit and the bride say come yes let him that heareth say come Hallelujah let him that is a thirst come whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely amen heavenly father bless Lord the portions of the scripture that we've read Lord may you father Quicken it to our hearts pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen we want to speak a little bit tonight identified with your sacrifice identified with your sacrifice we F first saw here in the Book of Genesis how that Abel amen the seat of God that came came with Revelation in his heart to bring this worship unto God brother bham tells us that if worshiping God is the only thing that God required then uh Cain was just as Justified abble was but that's not the only thing that God requires God requires us to worship Him Bible says he wor he seeks such to worship Him in spirit and in truth but that's not the only thing that he's asking for he he is he is warning us to come with Revelation and how many knows that Revelation does not lay in your mind and it does not lay in your flesh it lays in your heart a revelation from God does not stay in your mind it's in your heart it's something that is inside of you it's something that is part of you it's part of your makeup it's part of who you are amen it's something that is inside of you it's in your heart remember that because Revelation is upon which Jesus Christ Hadi his church said it would be the same Capstone that would Shield the church in the last days it would be Revelation amen The Shield of God Upon Our forehead amen that declares the name of God Amen so it's the same seal in the end time it's Revelation that God leads his church by it's Revelation by which it is edified and you have to remember that Revelation is not intellectual knowledge it's not your flesh Revelation is your soul connected with God in communication that he is giving you an understanding of the promised word for the hour amen Revelation is in your heart not in your mind not in your flesh not in what you want not in the desires of of the human being but the soul is that part that comes from God the soul is the one that comes predestinated and the word is the soul amen it's the gene is the part of God Amen that come from God it will return back to God Amen and that is the part that where Revelation lies how many can say Amen Revelation is in the heart it's in the soul amen so if God is Not only requiring worship but he's requiring amen Revelation he's requiring us to come with our hearts amen do you understand it is not simply that we try to work something up to worship God how many come to worship God tonight amen and brother Adam says it's our attitude that has to do a lot with it because Cain when he came to the Garden of Eden to the east side of the gate he buil an altar and he went to worship when he went to worship with the wrong Spirit he went to worship with a bad attitude and many times brother said in the message the voice of God brother said amen that same attitude that had many people bring the church amen it's the same attitude that came had this is the best I've had this is the best I can do this is all I can give you take it or leave it brother said that's the attitude that people in the church have Hallelujah God doesn't want what you want to give up God requires what he has demanded Hallelujah and that's your whole hearted worship hallelujah hallelujah amen amen it's not well this is what I this is what I can uh uh give this is all I have brother you if God is calling you to worship him then he that should give or provided something amen a revelation is provided amen but you've got to enter into the into the True Heart of a worshiper amen and the Heart of a worshiper seeks the will of God he wants to please God and when he is seeking in that manner to please God Amen then God will provide the channel of re for him to know how to approach God what to worship God for Hallelujah and this is why the Bible says that it is impossible to please God without faith and faith is revelation Hallelujah that's the only thing that pleases God it's a heart amen with Revelation a heart with faith a heart that believes God Amen and believes that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and that's the reason why from Genesis Revelation that's God's that's God's requirement for the worship notice what brother R says in the message Corinthians book of Correction then you say say oh Hallelujah he said they haven't got the spiritual blessings that we have they're cold and formal glory to God I ate the real man of God I know it's truth that's exactly the truth but what difference does that make in other words that can be true amen but the attitude is not correct says now the Holy Ghost really Falls in our church he said that's good but what difference does it does it make if you're not the right kind of a vessel that it's falling in remember you say I'm sincere I keep this in mind I'm sincere so were they they left their homes they went out they even put their neck out for death to follow they did not they did a lot more than we have to do today that didn't have one thing to do with it just think the Bible said in vain do they worship do they worship me listen absolutely true worship in Hallelujah where did it begin at from from the Garden of Eden he worshiped God just the same as able did but vain he worshiped yes sir brother he said absolutely true worship the worship is true but it's vain to God because of the heart we go to the Book of Mark amen I I believe I read this last uh Saturday either Wednesday I'm not sure but in the Book of Mark 7 amen amen verse verse six he answered and said unto them well have Isaiah's prophesied of ye Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips see again notice the focus again but their heart yes is far from see again it's speaking of the heart you understand where is revelation at in your mind in your flesh and how your body feels sir it's in the Heart Is that what abble had in in the Garden of Eden he had Revelation in his heart hallelujah hallelujah how be in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of [Music] men see amen amen now we see the is showing us he says again the message the results of decision he says can enable both of them Worship in the beginning see Cain wasn't an infidel my no no it wasn't brought a sacrifice they done everything that they could do both of them why did Abel why did Abel was accepted because Abel was spiritual minded spiritual minded not caral minded spiritual it was revealed to Abel that it wasn't fruits and apples that brought us out of the Garden of Eden it was the blood hallelujah amen and he offered a blood a lamb by spiritual Revelation and Jesus said that he would build this church on that spiritual Revelation bless blood has not revealed to you you never learned it in the Seminary you never learned it by being Orthodox but flesh and blood is not revealed this to you my father which is in heaven Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you how are you going to stop it if it's spiritual Revelation hallelujah hallelujah now notice brother sister that this that comes from Genesis in the beginning of the book goes to the middle of the book Jesus brother bam said that Abel and Cain was the same as Jesus and Judas message the seat of discrepancy 1965 he says we can still preach Divine Healing and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we still have power of God to separate us from the things of the world God said so the apostolic age has never cease and it will not cease it goes on we find that the same old s the same s of discrepancy amen Amen brother if it was never forgiven then what about now the real seat of all the ages is coming together now notice this this great thing that bam did it went on and on and finally it ended in the coming of Judas scariot and Jesus what was it Judas and Jesus was exactly a figure of Cain and Abel did you hear that J Jesus was exactly a figure of can for as Judas was religious so was Cain religious Cain built an altar he made a sacrifice he worshiped God he was just as sincere listen it was just as sincere in it as the other one was but you see he didn't have the revelation of what the word was now sincerity has something to do with it hallelujah amen but brother Adam said it's not all together just sincerity it's not sincity only there's got to be truth in that sincerity he says the people in Africa amen they worship amen crocodile gods and they feed their babies to the crocodiles sincerely that doesn't make it right amen there's got to be truth behind sincerity there got to be Revelation behind sincerity and Cain was sincere he was he was worshiping God sincerely in in other words with all that he knew with all that was in him he was sincerely worshiping God but he didn't have in him what God required sir Hallelujah yes sir hallelujah hallelujah now he says he thought it was Adam and Eve that eat some apples but Abel by Revelation knowed it was wrong it was blood that brought them out and he offered a lamb and God testified that his offering was right and then he got jealous and tried to kill his brother and as he killed his brother upon the same altar listen he killed his brother upon the same altar that his sacrifice died on did you get that Abel died on the same altar that his sacrifice died on the lamb died upon the Altar and so did abble on the same altar so did Judas ISU betrayed Jesus upon the altar of God and killed him just as Cain killed Abel because Cain was the seed of discrepancy now notice and brother continues to say the mess resurrection of Lazarus he says Abel LED his lamb by a grap Vine and sacrificed him on the Altar and Abel died on the same altar that he sacrificed lamb amen amen amen every believer that comes to Christ must die on the same altar with his dying lamb Christ and die in Christ to be a new creature die out of the things of the world and become a born again a new creature in Christ Jesus die on the same altar of self sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah again in the message the cruelty of sin he says listen friend remember Abel went out into his herd and he and he got a lamb and he killed it on the sacrifice block he says you better catch this now abble died on the same rock that his land died on are you willing tonight to die out to yourself are you willing to die out to all your thoughts of yourself just lay on the rock with your L and die out oh God have mercy when I think of many and women who think of Pride young men and women who will give their lives over to other things and Men of age too thinking of their job and of their Prestige and of neighborhood and over something like that oh why don't you crawl a Calvary Hallelujah let your own life be hacked die Yonder on the cross with him throw your arms around the Rock of Ages let me hide myself in thee while the near Old Waters roll while the Tempest still is high hide me oh savior let the world do whatever they want to let the theologians do whatever they want to I don't want their theology I want Jesus Christ in my heart let hallu oh my how many know that that is prophesied for the bride in this hour how many know that this ain't just a tonight how many know and it's a reality in the last day that we're living in it's a prophecy to be fulfilled in the show amen the bride's got to be identified with her sacrifice she's got to be killed on the same altar that the was killed all hallelujah hallelujah the sacrifice of the word amen amen and that same word sacrifice in this day amen is what we've got to be identified with not identified by intellectual not identified by just knowing the quotes by just reading the messages by just repeating some history but identifi with the sacrifice of the crucified word because that same thing that same life that same word is been revealed in a briide in this last day and that same spirit of jealousy Hallelujah that same spirit it's crucified the word again right amen so the bride must be identified with her sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah if he died on that altar if this word died on the altar where's the bride going to die Hallelujah where is she going to be sacrificed amen where is she going to be smitten amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I noce then when this takes place Hallelujah blood of the identified worshiper cries out to God hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah when not before but when Abel dies with his sacrifice then his blood cries oh that's good hallelujah amen it's not before it's after that the lamb was sacrificed you understand he had the sacrifice word in his worship amen God Vindicated his worship to be correct understand because he was producing what God required for that that's good brother but then amen he had to be killed on the same altar that the lamb was crucified the one that he was presenting think about this the one that he was offering to God see now he is crucified on the same Rock of sacrifice see and it's done and when it's done then the voice yes of his blood amen C Hallelujah I know that in this day the word was crucified am yes sir amen ra said I this [Music] generation for the second crucifix of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah and he said I indict the denominations I indict orain ministers I indict denominational churches and the independent crucifying the effects of the word yes sir in the people that's what he said that's the crucifixion not one man when they crucify that the word is supposed to have in the people yes sir when you kill those promises the word Jesus said the same scripture we read in The Book of Mark you because of your your manmade Commandments you have made of none effect amen the word of God in the people because of your Traditions amen you have made the word of God not effect yes sir verse 13 making the word of God of non effect through your which ye are delivered in many such like things do ye so in the same uh uh sermon that Jesus is rebuking them because of their V worship he telling them that they are making the word of God not have an effect on the people because of their tradition ition here in Mark 7 amen amen the headline of that is Pharisees rebuke that's why said now notice when when you look at that and you realize that this is connected with the worship amen All Through the Bible that the worshiper has to be identified with his sacrifice how many know that that the disciples Jesus even told Jes uh Peter when you were a young man you did what you wanted you went where wherever you wanted the time will come they'll tie your hands you'll be led where you don't want to go how many know the scripture says right out after that he was speaking of the way that Peter was going to die amen how did they take Jesus amen amen was he as a lamb before his shears was he taken to one place and then to another how were his worshippers done amen how was Peter done how how was James how was Paul how was the ones that were identified with that sacrifice in that hour that the religious world had crucified physically the flesh amen then they received they were identified with that sacrifice amen and we are identified with that sacrifice is that right amen but that was natural and they suffered a natural death how many know that the bride in this hour amen is not to see deathu Hallelujah know that in this hour the word was crucified and the sacrifice that we're identified with was not that somebody's flesh was crucii it wasn't Willam R's flesh it wasn't somebody else's flesh being crucified it was the word rightall and if we're identified with that sacrifice we must Hallelujah in the same manner amen as that sacrifice was crucified we are identified that sacrifice because the problem of the word of God to be fulfilled in the revealing of the son of man that's the way the word was crucified like denominations Hallelujah glory to God and how do you think the word is being crucified or how how do you think that the worship is going to be identified with his sacrifice unless the same thing happens again for him to be identified with the sacrifice he must die on the same altar a sacrifice amen is sacrifice glory to God amen amen amen amen so Jesus was crucified his flesh was nailed to the cross look at Peter was he identified with the sacrifice did he die the same way amen but he said I'm not worthy turn me upside down you see what I'm saying that was natural this is spiritual so in other words expect the same that your sacrifice Reed hallelujah amen amen amen how was our sacrifice crucifying the effects of the word yes sir he said they stand from their pulpit and they crucify the effects of the word amen listen this is where this is where I believe that this has to become more real to us because it's not until after that was killed that his voice cries Hallelujah but today it's it's not our voice that's going to cry that's right it's not our blood anyways right amen when we read in Hebrews 12 the blood of the New Covenant Jesus the mediator the blood of the sprink that speaketh better things the blood of so there's a blood that's that has a voice amen amen is it expected say for the bride to be smitten and crucified is that a promise in the last day Isaiah 53 brother BR read it like this in the message Masterpiece she is smitten she is despised rejected of men we hit our faces from her she was despised and we esteemed her not she is smitten brother Ram says she is smitten from the church body she is smitten with her master amen hallelujah so our sacrifice was smitten but she is smitten with her sacrifice for the same purpose she is the wordu what he say she is the [Music] word just the same as Joseph was smitten from his brethren because he was the word amen Jesus was smitten from his Brethren because he was the wordu the bride is smitten from the church because she is the water The Living Word and in action the Bible bride not some man smitten and of God that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all denomination according to Revelations 3 smitten out of the church that she was raised up hallelujah amen amen amen he says according to Revelations 3 what is he talking about according to Revelations 3 they put Jesus on the outside and his wife amen is that right how how did they crucify Jesus in this age they had nothing to do with him they crucified the effects Hallelujah of the word of God being displayed through a prophet in this age that knew who he was William Bram didn't have to go ask somebody amen do you believe that I'm Malachi 4 have to ask nobody he knew who he was by Revelation he knew who he was he knew what his purpose was he knew what he was called for he didn't have to get the approval of somebody yeah on Amen and that everybody would agree with him hallelujah hallelujah but that's what they crucified amen and when they rejected the word that was being revealed amen amen when they rejected the first grain of wheat that reached maturity They Crucified the word hallelujah amen hallelujah yes you understand amen now brother what did Brother brand say the message what shall we do Jesus called the Christ he said pilot couldn't get the blood off of his [Music] hands the blood was on his hands hallelujah amen his conscience wouldn't leave him that's why he kept washing his hands he tried to wash his hands before the people he tried to wash his hands all the time after that he went insane brother R says now the blood is in the hands of America so now the the blood is in the hands Methodist of theti BL is in their hands and that message then he goes further on and he says whoever these tapes have gone you have received them and you are you have heard this tap said now the blood is on your headu he said and the only way to get it off your hands is to put it in your heart you see how it comes back again to the heart true worship brother it's got to be from had a revelation and the Revelation what do we say at the beginning it's not your mind it's not your flesh it's in your heart am hallelujah hallelujah the only way to get the blood your is the goodness message in your soul Hallelujah for it to be a revelation in your heart amen but brother with that blood on their hands they can't wash you off they've got to accept what the blood is hallelujah they can't try to pass it on to someone else well I'll send him to Herod so he can deal with them I just don't want to have nothing to do with this amen and let me say this tonight the blood is on the hands of message people hallelujah amen they got got these tapes in their hands got these books in his hands the blood's on their hands they've either got to accept amen all that the message says in their hearts the Bloods of their hands and brother Bram said God revealed the bride amen amen the church is the blood Jesus Christ amen so blood on their hands who's the blood now the is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit Hallelujah amen see so when you begin to identify what the blood is spiritually speaking then when you begin to identify where the voice is going to speak from because the the blood speaks Hallelujah the blood ofel had a voice and when he was identified with his sacrifice his sacrifice or his blood spoke amen amen when we are identified with our sacrifice the blood speaks amen better things the understand amen amen now notice the blood is on their hands what are they going to do with oh my they can try to wash it off yeah water it down they can try to wash it say no no it's not so no no no no oh no no no it's not so long iow they'll never be able to do it that's right when they play a tape somewhere in that message they'll hear brother say contrary to what they're saying when they read a book sooner or later that blood's going to speak but they'll all that time they they'll have to put it aside yeah they'll have to try to not just just skim over there you see what I'm saying the blood speaks whether they want to hear it or not that's what I'm I'm saying brother is that the voice that's speaking today is not a different voice than what's on the table am it's the same voice that's right amen hallelujah hallelu and the blood speaks when does it speak I you it speaks when the bride is being identif [Applause] she's being squeezed yeah brother that's when it begins to speak when the thing begins to come upon the pressure of religious power Hallelujah that's good upon the true worshiper after their worship has been Vindicated by God after their Revelation has been accepted by God after their Revelation Hallelujah has been Vindicated amen then the pressure comes amen then that comes against the bride so that she can be identified with her you understand what he says in the message see the discrepancy 65 this is hardest time in the beginning when God swed his seed upon on the earth gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was their only defense that was their only defense and here come the enemy and broke that barrier by sewing the seat of discrepancy contrary to the word of God if that was discrepancy in the beginning it's it's still anything that will add anything to the word of God is still the seed of discrep I don't care where it comes from if it's from organization if it's from military sources if it's from political sources anything that's contrary to the word of God is the seed of discrep when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and says that the days of Miracles is passing that's the seat ofu when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church somewhere and does not believe that Jesus is the same in every detail except the physical body the same yesterday today and forever that's the seed of discrep when he says that the Miracles and the apostolic age has passed that's the seed of discrepan when they say there's no such a thing as Divine Healing that's the seed of discrep the world is full of it and it crowds out and chokes out the wheat my goodness amen oh brother it's the same thing in this when the word of God is identified that's why brother Bram told us that the true church amen has to receive a revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church outside within yes sir two [Applause] Spirits hallelujah hallelujah the spirit cist would come into the church and defile it making it luk War andless it exposes revealing his works the tempted destruction of God's people and discredited of God's word right down to the time is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church amen hallelujah come on you got to get the revelation of the true church and what she stands for that what he said what she stands for and what she is what that c discrepancy is against it's against let the people know who they really are it's against it's a spirit of nism the Same Spirit listen to this that came in in the eent church when that true Alpha bride amen was there during that time Hallelujah there was a period of time amen we in the seat of discrepancy did not exist because it was a true rde amen from the day of Pentecost until 53 ad it was a pure but then brother R said in the message SE of discrepancy he said notice amen 20 years hallelujah hallelujah after that the Holy Ghost fell the seed of discrep fa oh my whether that was right that was right when that Spirit NM come in defile the church what did Paul say I'm afraid that as the serpent amen so you have turned to another gospel brother said in the message it is the rising of the sun he said they turn to a make belief God to a gopel ofic amen amen Gospel of fiction a Make Believe Gospel now notice it says the true church if they can get the true Revelation the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she'll be an invincible I get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and with the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely th today as when Christ with his every effort to gain power over him in the desert Satan hates Revelation but we love it with the true revelation listen in our lives you see how he says with the true Revelation in our lives Hallelujah in whose lives in our lives Brother people make it seem as though Revelation just something you you hear you get in your mind and there and Hallelujah I believe the message I believe it and I believe it amen Amen brother and sister we've got to be identified with our sacrifice and that Revelation has to be in our lives in our lives amen that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us yes sir see what he said is that contrary to the word you tell me Jesus said in Matthew 16 Upon This Rock listen now Upon This Rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell will not prevail against it against what against the Revelation yes can't Prevail against a revelation but where's the Revelation with true Revelation in our lives see that's where it's at the gates of hell cannot Prevail against us hallelujah amen but we will prevail over them so he calls the Gates of Hell them and he calls the rock of Revelation us hallelujah sacrifice [Applause] true relation in our lives the of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah oh brother this is why when we look at this we have to identify where the word is in this hour B said it's the continuation of his word yes sir he said she has thus sayth the Lord she keeps she has the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with the word not what somebody else wants to do with the word you see what I'm saying because they want to do with the word what they want to do with the word and what they want to do is make it fit their manmade idea Hallelujah they can fit their doctr they can fit what they teach that's what they want to do with Hallelujah but the bride the of Christ to know what he wants to the word yes sir amen what does he want us to do with his word hallelujah you ask somebody what they want you to do with the message they'll tell [Music] you this what I want you to do with the message read these quotes right here and forget about all the the rest that's what I want you to do with the word that's what they'll say Amen you go to somebody else what do you want me to do with the message okay I'll show you stay with me three days and I'll show you what I want you do with the with the message amen amen go with somebody else they'll say I'll show you what I want you to do with the message look at these quotes right here see that this proves my do you see this right here this proves my do you see this over here proves my do see what I'm saying but the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants us to do with the word hallelujah to God and what he wants us to do is to believe he wants us to believe all of he wants us to identify with he wants us to become one with Hallelujah to be all of it God for that word to live in you for you to be a manifested Hallelujah the SE of discrepancy watch what he says right here amen he says a few nights ago a minister of Ariz own great famous School here in the city came to me and said I want to straighten you out on something and I said when you get a chance he said he said when you get a chance I said this is the best chance I know come on over come on he said Mr brandom you're trying I believe you're sincere and honest but you're trying to introduce a world an Apostolic doctr he wasn't talking about the denomination he's talking about the book of Acts and he says and said the apostolic age ceased with the apostles I said the first thing I'd like to ask you my brother listen do you believe that every word of God is inspired you see what brother asked him oh yeah in other words you're going to come up with this idea you you have to deny a lot of scriptures my goodness but if you claim you believe all the word I'm going to show you some places in the word that this proves what you think you see what I'm saying brother it's the same thing [Applause] today what can we ask somebody in the message today that comes up with these ideas maybe they haven't read them sure then God would still forgive their ignorance yeah sure yes see one other thing is May they read them but they it doesn't fit what they what they believe so they discredited then they don't believe every word amen that's right who in the message because they hear Brother ra say it all the time who in the message doesn't say I believe all the word everyone say that yeah but the thing is when it comes to certain places see okay so he asked him do you believe every word of God is inspired he said yes sir I certainly do I said then when you show me in the word where the apostolic AG se you show me where where it is and I'll believe with you I said the writer of the apostolic age the writer the one that had the keys to the kingdom on day Pentecost when the apostolic age was introduced he said men and brethren they they they said what can we do to be saved you said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and This Promise is unto you unto your children to them that is far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call now how can you how can the word contradict itself the man said I have an awful cold tonight I said I think so too now you tell me is God still calling is God still calling is he still calling in the apostolic age is still existence brother until the last one is called Hallelujah and when the last one is called the bride will take off Hallelujah so until then the apostolic age C but only for the Gentiles he'll continue with the Jews God hallelujah so he's still calling when he calls the last name in the book the resurrection and the Rapture will take place so until he calls the last one the book of Acts is still in continuation Hallelujah the Supernatural still [Applause] effect well I haven't seen it because you don't believe you don't believe it that's it that's right cuz you're an unbeliever Hallelujah in those things brother say people that believes in the Supernatural will see superal people that believe div healing we see div healing he said because they come under that atmosphere he said go to a church where the pastor teaches that those things are not so you'll find everybody believing the same thing but he said go to the church where the pastor preaches amen God still heals God still does this God still he still has power he said you'll find in the congregation testimonies of the same miraculous power [Applause] hallelujah oh my listen to this that he said right here amen he continues to say so Jesus Christ is still calling the apostolic Agee has not ceased Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we find today that the SE of discrepancy has been sold through every age notice he says we are all most of us read the Bible and know when Jesus come he found discrepancy he was the word made manifest he was God's interpretation of the word was Jesus was the interpretation of the promises for that [Music] hour hallelujah hallelujah and he says and he told them search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me there you are he was the interpretation of the word and today every born again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word hallelujah every son and daughter born of this age is the interpretation of the word you are written Epistles read of all men notice he told them in vain do they worship me teaching discrepancy for Doctrine teaching discrepancy for Doctrine in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the discrepancy the doctrine of man Creeds of man teaching that to be the word of God when it has nothing to do with the word of godu Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you believe that in this say God Amen in every age has had his anointed Messiah Hallelujah is that right God had so much complete control of them so he was their voice their action hallelujah hallelujah amen amen glory to God see he was in his heart he must do it it was his life he couldn't he couldn't hold it there was something a pulsation that pushed them they they couldn't bless it or to curse it God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice he was their action hallelujah hallelujah give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God to their every action and their move is thus sayth the Lord walk in that sh glory and I'll show you a messiah standing upon amen amen now notice as we want to close this out tonight you see the purpose that we have to be identified amen with our sacrifice why brother because today people are crucifying the effects the promised word that is to be fulfilled and is fulfilled in his bride Hallelujah and they kill the effects that is supposed to have when the very word itself is the one that testifies of the things that are supposed to be done in this last day is that right brother Bram said the prophet of this age is the holy spirit am said the Holy Spirit was the prophet the days of Moses the Holy Spirit was the prophet the days of Isaiah the Days of Elijah listen he said the Holy Spirit was the prophet listen in the days of Amen the Holy Spirit was the prophet in the days of mAh who was one that stayed with the prophy of el the Hallelujah one that was trying to be told what to preach one that was being told to say what it all the other prophets were saying amen then we can have fellow want to have Fellowship you got to say the same thing that the prophets are saying amen but he PR he prayed amen amen and he saw the vision hallelujah hallelujah amen and in the vision he saw Israel's scatter she he saw God sitting on his throne did Isaiah see the same vision Isaiah did he saw God on his throne High left did John see the same vision Revelations one it's the same vision hallelujah amen saw the vision of God sit on his throne brother that speaking of the vision of the last day hallelujah hallelujah amen Dominion Power Authority preeminence ruler he saw the counsil of God gathered together in a spirit from underneath Hallelujah Rose to the council and said I will go down and I will enter into them cusing prophesy amen Amen brother BR said was at the end time Hallelujah that's why could only say what Elijah had said am he checked his vision he checked his Revelation he checked his his his Revelation that he had received from God with El's message Hallelujah and he said here it is right here it fits perfectly Elijah cursed Jebel and here are these guys aligning themselves with that same kind of thing amen when you go back the Prophecies of Elijah you find things that he cursed amen amen how are you going to bless that you see what I'm saying amen amen exactly amen if you go back to what the Prophecies of Elijah [Music] said where he said thus sayth the Lord have nothing to do but that Spirit he said have nothing to do with it that's what he said thus sayth the Lord have nothing to do with that Spirit he said I saw it in the vision it was a serpent yellow and black hallelujah hallelujah he said it didn't die it went into the waters he said they make me an antichrist have nothing to do with that he said say the Lord so if you go back to what Elijah curse understand what I'm saying then you see amen that these are wanting to join themselves to them see I'm saying so hallelujah we're going to have some fellowship let's prophesy together what do you think m is going to do see what I'm saying amen is it scriptural or not amen amen is it happening again today or not the holy spirit is the prophet in the days the holy spirit is the prophet of the days of the amen amen this is the reason why we we must be identified sacrifice cling tonight amen look what brother bam says the message all things Jesus said the father sent me and the god that sent him was with him and in him he said if I do not the works of no believe me and if I'm not telling you the truth he won't back it up then God that sent forth his disciples has sent this move of God into the land he's with it to prove that he's with it the very signs that was promised are vindicating his presence we're in the presence of Jesus Christ accept your healing I accept it I don't care what happens now I'm not looking to that I'm looking to your faith anchored Yonder anchored at the cross where you placed your hand listen place your hand on your sacrifice go and believe it you'll have to get well keep your hand on your sacrifice now the reason is saying that we probably won't have uh time enough tonight but there's a whole lot more to this to be identified with his sacrifice because in the Old Testament when the worshiper would bring his sacrifice to the temple he had to bring his sacrifice had to bring it holy sacrifice amen and whole amen it had to be a perfect sacri it couldn't have blemishes in it Hallelujah he couldn't have defects in it amen it had to be pure Hallelujah it couldn't have a little bit of of something deformed in it and brother said when you take a word away from the from the word of God the word of God becomes deformed Hallelujah he said the body of Christ here the word of God and when you take a portion of that or you add something to it he said it becomes a freak body amen it's like somebody with another Toes or or something like with another eye or three ears it's a form money you can't add to it or you can't take away the the sacrifice has got to be whole hallelujah hallelujah amen so look when the worshipper it is strange because about a week ago or two weeks I've been listening to this message all things I I think I even sent out a text to everyone that I could to listen to and just medita listening on it then praying after service one day amen I was sitting right there I just remembering about that then I opened the scripture I can't even I can't even tell you where I open to but it was somewhere in Leviticus I think and uh my eyes fell right on the park where the Bible says and the worshipper or the offerer would bring his lamb to the priest amen and the Bible said right there and this is what brother R is talking about in this message many other messages he says they had the in the Bible says there and he shall lay his hand upon the sacrifice Hallelujah and when I I read that immediately I remembered in this message where brother Ram says that this the the worshiper was to lay his hand on his sacrifice to be identified listen I'm going quote first from the message the world is falling apart he says Israel when God told them to take a sacrifice and go offer it it was a great thing you can imagine a Jew going down to the road with a lamb a fat little lamb or a bulock now where did that come from how was sacrificing Lambs instituted into the law amen am who was the first one to do that it was able in the garden and then when the law come amen that was instituted as a part of worship and sin offering for the worshiper that would go to the temple because that's what able did as a true worshiper on his altar in the Garden of Eden and there was an act commanded by the law that he had to do and that was to put his hand upon the sacrifice amen amen and that was showing that he was identified with that sacrifice now now now listen and he says and he would bring it for whatever it was Passover and he goes down and he lays his hand upon the sacrifice listen to what brother Ram said that's connecting himself he's conect connecting himself identifying himself with the sacrifice amen hallelujah so when he's putting his hand on the sacrifice he's connecting with the sacrifice and he's identifying with the sacrifice then he says again when he puts his hand on it amen see the priest killed amen the the Beast of the little lamb whatever it was and as a little fellow di kicking and bleeding the blood splashes upon hiss amen see the blood spashes upon his hand and the worshiper in sincerity know that that should be him but the lamb was taking his place that's what Jehovah required because it was a type of Christ but one time that kept on going as a family tradition they offered the lamb just the same but there was no sincerity then God said those sacrifices stink in my nostrils Hallelujah and today years ago we used to find people in deep sincerity and worship amen see but now brother he says is some tight clothes skin on the outside almost dancing all all around platform no sincerity almost making it just an outright ridiculous shame Christianity professing it I wonder if our offerings hasn't become kind of a stench in his nose again our differences it's just the same that the enemy has taken our American women and stripped them down out in the streets is a disgrace no wonder little boys and girls and things in such a sh shape as they are today they're always trying to pattern after some woman out here in Hollywood hwood married four or five times she'll come out with some sort of new clothes all little girls in the country will pattern after that what a Pity that's too bad it's too bad it got into the church the beautiful virtue that God gave a woman to be a mother has been mared amen the message Investments he says the Jew put his his hand upon the sacrifice to connect himself with the sacrifice Hallelujah now you Believers that receive the holy ghost look who is standing up all around you lay your hands over them as a commemoration that you are a Believer touch their hand or something while we pray don't doubt believe now it's not an emotion it's the sweetness of the holy spirit that comes down and fills every life now you're in now they're in your hand you've made a contact with them just like when you put your hands when the Jew put his hand on the sacrifice to connect himself with the sacrifice what one day you laid your hands Upon Jesus connecting yourself with the sacrifice the life of the sacrifice has come back on you the blood I may be speaking tonight on the token amen it's got to be upon you see it's got to come on you you youve you've connected yourself with this man or woman who wants to believe just stand right up now and lay your hands on those who wish to receive it that's right God bless you what a wonderful time don't be in a hurry just remember pray for their for this person amen amen so here in the message amen the token he says we have to identify ourselves with our sacrifice we have to be identified in his death when a Jew plac his hand upon the sacrifice he was identifying himself transferring his sins to his sacrifice and the sacrifice died now we place our hands by faith on Upon Jesus Christ and are identified with him in his death not only in his death but if we are accepted we are identified not only in his death but in his resurrection but the life that was in him is sent back upon the believer as a token as a memorial that death has passed from it God has sealed you into the kingdom of God until the day of your Redemption Ephesians 4:30 real genuine gospel as clean as I know it I know it's true I've tried it there's no other ISM there's no other work there's no schemes or mimics no nothing it's just pure unadulterated faith in the word of God and the finished works that God required at Calvary knowing that there is nothing that we can do to save ourselves we must accept what he did for us let your hands on the sacrifice stand on your feet tonight it's strange hallelujah hallelujah how these things are taking place see that's the way it is tonight we can come and sympathize with everything that God does but that isn't what he requires you've got to apply it it's not sufficient until you apply it the blood must be applied and when it's applied on you it shows that you are identif the worshiper says laid his hand upon the lamp then killed it identify himself with the sacrifice Hallelujah the same thing we do tonight is lay our hand upon our sacrifice and identify ourselves with him he is the word we have to be identified only through Christ so when we're identified by the word because he is the word and always has been and he is the same yesterday today and forever apply it Church don't fail Don't Let the Sun set now don't rest there are not don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token you say I believe yes I I go yeah I believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token do you hear random Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all your believing is in vain see you've still live a good life you listen to what the word says huh you go to church you try to live right that's fine live a good life listen know what the word says go to church try to live right that's fine but that's not it amen when I see the blood that's the token hallelujah amen yes Lord when we see the things upon the earth oh this people is is this is the last hour get that token over you quickly as you can you get in the token get in the token amen amen as we see the great inside and the time at hand warning us time is at hand oh take this solemnly we should love one another we should be so in love we never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with God we are brothers and sisters oh live Godly live like Daughters of God live like sons of God live sweet kind and humble let no evil come in your mind in your thinking just dismiss it if it knocks on your door take it away just say just show your token just keep walking I'm under the blood hallelujah hallelujah see we're not just yet come together to talk about the message they come together to apply the to hallelujah hallelujah or don't come together and say I believe it get
