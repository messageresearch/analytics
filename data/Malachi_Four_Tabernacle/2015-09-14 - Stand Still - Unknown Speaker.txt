the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper amen and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn yes this is the her this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayith the Lord amen how many can say Amen to that you believe God is speaking to you in that scripture Romans chapter 8 Romans verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did know for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren more whom he did predestinate him he also called and whom he called he also Justified and whom he justified also glorified amen amen what shall we say then shall say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen amen who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth is it Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God whom also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword amen what is the Capstone love amen as it is written for th sake for thy sake are we killed all the day long we out counted as sheep for the slaughter n in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come neither height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord NE amen Psalms chapter 46 Psalms pmos in the Book of Psalms Psalm number 46 Hallelujah from verse five God is in the midst of her she shall not be mov amen hallelujah God shall help her and that right early the Heathen raged

Heathen and I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of host is with us hallelujah the god of Jacob is our refuge Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you oh God in this hour for the reading of thy holy and precious word we know oh God that you have called us in this hour into a battle father and this battle is Raging hard we see the effects of it we see it how Lord the enemy Lord is coming with invading force and Lord in that Force he comes to kill and destroy he comes to divide and conquer oh God that's been his plan but this message has Lord shown the spirit of antichrist and it's Tak the mask off of the very thing but we know we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers and principalities wickedness in high places we understand oh God that even the enemy Lord his spirit is still working the same way but he's just changing form just as a perversion of what you do oh God and in this hour father we pray that your Holy Spirit would accomplish the purpose by which Lord you have led us tonight to be here in your house to worship you spirit and Truth to hear Thy word Lord and Lord to see father The Great Battle plan for our life Lord in this hour that we're living a dangerous hour a dark hour hour of great confusion an hour oh God as we said this morning as in the days of the judges everyone doing according to what they think and they feel but Lord you have given us an absolute in this hour and upon that Lord we can agree father we can come in one mind in one Accord we can Lord gather together under the mighty power of almighty God Of You Lord here tonight and Lord we can see father Lord by Your Word how you plan to conquer the enemy in this hour we pray father that you would help us that you would give your people Lord the spirit of Revelation to understand and they that they Lord may be attentive to your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you may be seated amen hallelujah brother Bram said the message why little Bethlehem amen I'll give you my title in a second but he said here in the message why little Bethlehem how is that David he was once a little boy how God dealt with him God led him and many different things he saw God delivered he saw God do many things he he says how that David he could remember when he sang Praises in his childhood days when he heard the sheep and and he he was remembering back there he would carry the shepherd staff and give me back my herd of sheep let me alone and back there to worship you and sometimes we think we think that we think that God has been left back there in those days but we find and we realize that we are in the heat of the battle and something has got to be done we were once boys like they was but we're growing up men now now it's not time to do the things that we did as back then the fight is on and I remember when the saw dust Trails boiled upon the floor the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't even get around the place nowhere amen amen and you and nowhere here for the people because but it's not that way today see the battle is on the battle has come the battle is Raging oh it's not William brandham William the little boy preacher anymore you've got to produce something yes sir there's got to be something different the time is on the battle is on the heat is on and the powers to be delivered the people Everyone that is found written in the book now the time has come amen amen in the time of the heat of the battle amen is when something has got to produce itself brother Bram said I can read many more quotes amen amen where brother Bram continues to say the same thing and it's now that we have to realize that what what we are facing in this hour what the challenge that has come the enemy amen is coming with full force he's coming with an attack amen and the time has come amen for the manifestation of the sons of God to show forth what God has been laying in his in his church all these years whatever he has planted what he has been giving us what he has taught us what he has revealed to us what he has shown Us in his word what he has spoke to us amen by the different Ministry what we have heard from the message all these things that have been planted into our hearts by Revelation now the time has come that these things must give a a product it must manifest it's the time to produce what has been given to us in this hour amen that's exactly what the prophet of God is saying here in that quote comparing it with David and then showing his own life amen how God dealt with him in the early years and how there was a great wonderful time but then there come a time of the heat of a battle amen amen and when we don't realize brothers that God has prepared us for this time we won't realize what's already in you for this battle in other words God has already prepared you Amen to face the challenge of this hour but the Bible says amen that many think and we've preached on this before the Bible says it in many places in ecclesiastics it says it in Isaiah it says it even in the New Testament that say not that the times of old were better than these amen for brother bam taught us as well that this day is where we have to open our eyes to see what God is doing in this hour you see the the one that is wanting an easy way or easy Road amen he is not looking Amen to Bear the reproach of Christ during the time when things are harder amen than there's ever been because brother bam said in during that time when those things were taking place like we said the other day uh they asked him the question amen how why is it harder to pray in this day than it was years ago and he said it's because the spirit of God is leaving the Earth amen and he said the Revival that was once on is no longer there amen that's what the prophet said he also said in the resume of the church ages when the prophet is speaking about the false teachers that was going to come in the last days brother bam said this now this like I said many times we think that one thing contradicts the other but it doesn't brother bam said in that message exposition of church ages he said that men would come after the message after the messenger and they would rise up and they would tell the people that Revival is here when the prophet has already said Revival is over I heard brother Bram say that brother said they are wolves and sheep's clothing amen amen the thing is we've got to understand and realize what season we're in there's different seasons and if we don't understand that we don't understand God's nature we don't understand God's plan when you look at nature and the natural amen you understand that there's Seasons there's a time of abundance there's a time of cold there's a time where there's a lot of abundance and there's times when there's not is that right there's time when the climate is nice and there's times when it's not that nice but the thing is that we've got to adapt to whatever the conditions are and know that during that time God still has control of all things amen amen you don't want to expect summer and winter if you if winter comes you know it's winter amen you know it's that season you know it's that time you know it's that that time has come around amen amen and the thing is we don't realize that amen we fail to understand what God wants to do hallelujah amen amen what God wants to do what he wants to give us what he wants to teach us what he wants to show us because we're too busy wanting something else you see and we we cannot be selfish in the kingdom of God it's not what you want it's what God wants amen hallelujah but a selfish person will say I like this this is how I like it and this is how I want it and this is how I like it and this is how I want it to be and if it isn't this way then something is wrong you got to understand brother and sister that the spirit of God will lead you through rough valleys the spirit of God brother says will take you into rough valleys amen The Same Spirit that leads you to victories the same spirit of God that leads you to a great Mountain experience amen it's the same God that is holding your hand when you go down into the valley it's not a different God it's the same God hallelujah amen amen and we've got to understand that a true Son of God a true daughter of God Abraham's Royal seed will stand for the word no matter what they feel no matter what they see no matter what they hear no matter what they taste hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't matter amen these five senses amen have to come in subjection to the word of God glory to God amen amen so when we look at the scriptures that we have read tonight we kind of see the pattern of it amen how many can see itlu we read in Isaiah 54 that God this is a beautiful scripture because he is promising that there that we will be far from oppression you will not fear amen amen then he says amen that though the enemy uh comes and gathers itself against you verse 15 amen they will not they're they're doing it not by by the Lord and whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the Smith now listen what God is saying here listen verse look at this verse 16 here I have created the Smith amen amen that bloweth the Coes in the fire in other words God created man in his own image and when he made the Smith amen he is showing an attribute of himself is that right what did Brother bam say Amen what does a Smith do when it's when he puts whatever metal that he is forming he he puts it in the fire and he takes it out and then he beats it hallelujah amen sometimes he takes us out of the fire and we think Hallelujah the Lord is saving me amen but no he's taking you out of the fire to beat you some and then to put you back in the fire amen is that right yes sir you said oh God help me I'm in the fire he takes you out of the fire beat yourself what did he beat you with with the hammer of his word and other words he want you understand this is the reason why my word says this my word says this I'm molding you into my image amen amen and then he says you understand now okay here you go back in the fire you understand we've got to understand those things why because when we don't understand oppression comes depression comes amen feelings that are not of God brother bam said those Spirits are of the devil depression is of the devil it's not of God amen amen amen the thing is that when we don't understand then we will through the whole process it still won't work amen now listen what he says cre the Smith and then he says and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the the the the wter to destroy see Hallelujah no weapon that is formed against thee Hallelujah shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judge me Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness of Me sayth Lord now in Romans 8 Paul says in verse 28 all things works together for good for who to them who are called Accord according to his purpose amen amen and then he shows you that the purpose of God is this for whom he didn't for know he predestinated to be what formed Hallelujah conform to the image of his son you understand that he might be the first born of many Brethren then those who he predestinated he called so if you're called according to his purpose you're predestinated because those he called he predestinated you understand Hallelujah then he says and Those whom he called he called them why cuz they were predestinated and the ones that he called because they were predestinated he justified amen you never did it in the first place and then them who he does that too by the blood of the Lamb take your book take your name amen out of The Book of Life and castes the Book of your deeds in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah amen glory them he also glorified see Hallelujah and he says what shall we then say to these things Amen to what things to what he just said amen amen y if God be for us who could be against us you understand in other words if God is in control of Our Lives what are you afraid of Hallelujah he's the one that's leading you he's the one that called you he's the one that predestinated you he's the one that justified you glory to God it doesn't matter what anybody else says things or done he called you he predestinated you he justified you he glorified you amen hallelujah so the thing is if that's you then he says what do we say to these things if God is for us if God has done these things for us then who can be against us it's God that justifies amen if the devil can't accuse you can't accuse you amen amen amen if the devil can't find no record amen if the demons can't find no record if the Angels can't find no record God don't even have it in his memory he's for you he's on your side then who can be against you amen thank you Lord hallelujah to God then he says he that not spared his own son but delivered him up for us all who shall not with him also freely give us all things what things all things Hallelujah who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies amen amen then he says who shall separate us you see what he's talking about from the love of Christ tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril sword amen amen see in all these things in all these things we're more than conquerors amen but I'm persuaded that neither death hallelujah hallelujah nor life this life amen David said thy loving kindness is better than life amen amen sometimes life is more dangerous than death but people are afraid of death instead of life that's true amen but life is more dangerous than death yes sir this life natural life is more dangerous than this amen amen that's why Paul said amen that you live for Christ and for him to die is gain brother this is where the battle is not up there over there's a resting place amen amen people are afraid of death when they should be afraid of life amen but neither death nor life nor angels amen amen nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen amen what do we read in Psalm 46 amen the Lord God is in the midst of her Hallelujah in the midst of who in the midst of his bride Amen in the M he is in the midst of her and what does it say verse five she will not be moved hallelujah hallelujah Glory because the kingdom of God is within her we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved and if the kingdom know ye not that the kingdom of God is within you is in you amen it comes not with observation amen amen but the kingdom of God is in you and if it's in you then ye shall not be moved God shall help her see how he's talking about a her this is for the bride the Heathen raged you see brother you got to understand something the Nations the heathens of this world they're going to come against this little chosen elected bride they're going to rage Brother full of the devil they're coming against and brother Bram said this little persecuted group will go in the Rapture Hallelujah that's what he called it amen amen the Heathen raged the kingdoms were moved amen God uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge verse 10 be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge now listen listen I'm going to read three quotes and then we're going to go into a scripture that I want to preach on tonight and but this is a background for this for this thing right here in the message life story brother Bram says here there's a perfect way and there's a permissive way I feel that if God here on the platform can show me things that has been and in my rooms and so forth he is able to tell me just what he wants me and what he wants me to do where he wants me but I feel that as long as I got it all hooked up I feel like then he won't put his hands on it as long as I'm doing it that's the way it is anything as long as you're doing going to do it if somebody talks about you you talk back about them God can't fight your battle oh my hm but if someone talks about you and you stand still and you see the salvation of God God will fight for you amen amen but the thing is that no no no no no I got the word he's wrong and I'm going to tell him these things right here stand still and see the salvation of God listen brother he says here if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself see just let loose and let him do it brother why are we so worried sometimes about these things why do we get so so worked up about if God is with us who can be against us yeah if you're in the will of God just stay in your place let the chips fall where they will let everybody do what they want to do you stand for God Amen Hallelujah you stand for God just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him listen to this the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God amen amen when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him God will take care of it don't you believe that so why while I'm a way overseas if God willing I'm going to depend on you people to be praying for me especially if we get into Jerusalem in the message mzc the great Prince and King he says God be merciful oh my does your faith set still this morning when the trouble winds are blowing your faith has to settle still and the winds and the lightning are flashing does your anchor hold oh build your hopes this morning are nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness I know it's hard it seems hard but take it one time take God at his word and see what a blessed hope it is to March forward in faith in faith Amen in this great faith battle I've tried to fight it I've come through some awful obstacles I've been over some rough roads it shows on me I have but it's been the Most Blessed thing I wouldn't trade it for nothing and there's there and here's my greatest victory the greatest Pleasures that I have is when I come up against something that I can't see over Hallelujah I can't see around it I can't see under it but I'm just walking towards it believing this that God Will Make A Way when I get there I've never come to this to this place all this distance I have come I have trusted in him he has never failed me it's Grace that taught My Heart To Fear it's Grace my fear is relieved how precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed through many dangers and TOs and snares I have already come it's Grace that has brought me safe thus far it is Grace that have take me on and when we've been there 10,000 years by shining as a sun have no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun see when we rally there with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob those who are hes of the promise they're looking forward to us not to fall not to fail they're depending on us because they without us canot be made perfect they're depending on us this morning let's not fail them and let's not fail Christ not only are you fighting for yourself not only are you fighting for your family you're fighting for the kingdom Hallelujah you got to understand it's not just for you and your selfish motives no sir it's not just for you and your house it's for the kingdom it's for those who are on the other side waiting for us Amen to not fail to stand in faith you got to understand something tonight the holy spirit is wanting to show you something and that is that sometimes you don't got to do nothing all you got to do is just stand still Hallelujah but oh no what's going on we got to do something I got to do this do that if you know where you're at just stay there amen that's good amen amen oh no but but something's wrong we're all going to die oh just stand there and believe in God Amen [Applause] that's the thing brother that we got to learn that in the midst amen of the storm we got to stand oh my notice what says here amen keep your anchor in Christ now notice this is in the message stand still and see the salvation of the lord I want you to turn with me to Second Chronicles chapter 20 this is what we want to speak of on tonight second Chronicles chapter 20 brother Bram took this scripture in the message stand still and see the salvation of the Lord are you there amen amen verse one 1 second chronicles 20 and it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon with them other beside the ammonites came against Jo josephat to battle Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea of this side Syria and behold they be in Aon Tamar which is in AAR in in and josephat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast through all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord amen amen now notice the Bible here is telling us of this one Jehoshaphat Jehosaphat was one that lived in the days of Elisha of amen amen and brother said his father which was a righteous man in the message the invasion of the United States brother said Jehosaphat was a spirit filled man hallelujah amen amen and in this scene Jehoshaphat how many know who he was he was the king of Judah amen and the enemy is coming against Judah how many know what Judah is amen Judah is a representation of the banner of the lion that's the time that we're living in in this hour H that's the end time that's the time of judgment it's the time of the judge it's the great lion he has roared and seven Thunders have uttered their voices amen amen and this is the this is the time that we're living amen amen and this is where we have to see that in this end time is where there is an invasion of the eny against the bride of Christ against Judah against the king of Judah and against the inhabitants of Judah amen amen now notice that the enemy is coming let's read here verse five and and Jehoshaphat verse four and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord amen now brother and sister the enemy he has been told that the enemy is coming amen against Judah and what does Jehoshaphat do he proclaims a fast and a prayer Amen in other words he gives a proclamation he gives a message the king of Judah sends a message amen and what do the people do when they hear that message verse four Judah gathers themselves together amen amen what does the message do gather the bride the king of Judah proclaims a message and the people that receive that message the inhabitants of Judah they gather themselves together hello somebody Hallelujah now notice to ask help of the Lord and Joseph stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and and said oh Lord God of our fathers art thou not thou God in heaven amen and rulest not thou over all kingdoms of the Heathen and in thine hand is if there are not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee josephat is praying now look what he's praying the first thing brother he begins to tell God you're the god of our fathers amen amen in other words what you did for Abraham what you did for Isaac what you did for Jacob you'll do for us we are the children of those fathers we are the lineage of Abraham we are the Seed of Abraham hallelujah hallelujah he is getting God's attention and he's telling them how great he is that he is above all the heathens and that in his hand amen there is not power and might is there not power and might amen amen he's telling them how great he is Art not thou Our God who did drive out the inhabitants of the land before thy People Israel and gavest it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever amen he he's praying to God said Lord you drove the inhabitants out that was the promise you gave to Abraham This Promise for your seed amen and their seed seed they shall dwell in this land amen amen that's their inheritance and Abraham Lord it was your friend and and and I'm his seed hallelujah hallelujah you knew him and he knew you that was your friend and I'm a line of Abraham look how he's praying brother you got to pray according to the word of God just pray oh Lord just please help me that's good but God wants to hear you confess his word to him look what he says and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment pestilence what do we read in in in in Romans 8 what do we read in Romans 8 nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ and what does he say here read read verse eight amen verse n remember Deuteronomy 16 he was G give give him a place to worship and he was going to put his name in that place and in First Kings chapter 8 amen amen Solomon dedicating the temple he prayed a prayer to God Amen dedicated the temple and he said when your people is being attacked by the enemy when your people haven't had rain for years let them pray towards this place and you'll send them rain let them pray to this place and you'll deliver them from their enemy let them pray to this place amen and you oh God will provide for them hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glor what is Jehoshaphat doing he's praying to God but he is quoting to God another man's prayer Hallelujah I was anointed by the spirit of God amen amen hallelujah why do you think sometimes we pray the same prayers that the prophet prayed Hallelujah amen hallelujah look at Jehoshaphat he's quoting Solomon right there and First Kings see let let's go quickly to First Kings 8 quickly there first Kings 8 verse 29 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of thou which H has said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and that the people of Israel when they shall pray towards this place and hear and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when they and when thou hearest forgive If any man trespass against his neighbor and and oath be laid upon him to cause him to to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house then hear thou in heaven and do judge thy servants con uh condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness when thy People Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee then shall turn again to thee confess thy name and pray and make supplication to thee in this house then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers who When Heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray towards this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou Afflicted them then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy People Israel that thou teach them the good way therein in they should walk you see what I was just saying earlier and give them rain upon thy land which thou Hast given to thy people for an inheritance if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew Locust or if there be caterpillar if there and if their enemy bese them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever

and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest that thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men so p amen now let's go back 2 Chronicles 20 verse 9 look what Jehoshaphat is praying amen the same thing he is remember he is bringing to Rememberance of God brother bam said God wants you to likes you to remember him of his word amen he likes to hear you pray according to his word he knows his word he knows what he said but he likes when you tell him amen say Lord I know you know no tell him what he knows tell him what his word says amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah that's right correct Hallelujah he says sword judgment pestilence famine amen see amen and when your people cries unto thee you shall hear and help now behold the children of Amon and Moab Mount zir whom thou would us not let invade Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they took turn from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come cast us out of thy possession which thou Hast given us to inherit amen amen you see Jehoshaphat knows the scripture amen hallelujah he knows the scripture when Israel came out of Egypt and they were on their way to Canaan amen amen the god LED Israel to spare Moab Amen to spare the Ammon Amen to spare this people that would not let them pass through their country and God told Israel leave them alone keep going forward Jehosaphat knows the scripture that's what he's praying to God he's saying God remember that you told us to spare them and we kept going amen amen and we came into the land this is what they repay us with this is what they come to do now now they want to take us out of the possession that you given us to inherit and then he says Oh Oh Our God will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know ye what to do but our eyes are upon thee all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen Amen brother and sister he is really getting the business with God that's the thing brother the enemy is coming to take our rights he's coming

you the god of William BR but you're my God too amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah isn't it surprising glory to God that men that never walked with Jesus In the Flesh amen amen they amen and men that helped the ministry of that hour men that that were just you know uh people that came in afterward amen their names had places in the Bible as thus sayith the Lord scripture men like Timothy men like Fon amen how come the disciples names weren weren't in the scriptures how come they weren't given a book except Peter and James amen amen but from all the ones that walked with him amen amen that didn't mean nothing glory to God we got to understand that that same God is a here amen that it means nothing that they they they they seen him that they knew him that they did these things but if you don't know the Living God the present God The Great I Am then those things are worth nothing amen amen now notice what the king is going to do here is going to determine what happens in the battle whatever the king decides is going to determine the outcome of the battle the enemy is coming he's already been warned amen amen but his action what he does is going to determine what happens in this battle amen and in the middle of crisis in the middle of this kind of Crisis some break some Panic amen amen some don't know what to do and some some as in the case of this they try to ignore it they try to ignore it they try to ignore that something's going to happen brother bam said amen they know something is about to happen they know something is wrong they know that the threat of the enemy is upon them and they say oh it's all okay amen amen hallelujah hallelujah everything's all good praise the Lord amen but there's no desperation Jehosaphat when he heard this he got in desperation he got in conference with God amen amen he got in prayer with God he called a prayer meeting he called some fasting some praying amen amen he wanted to get in contact with God he wanted to hear from God he wanted to know what the will of God is in that circumstance and that's what I mean when I when I spoke in the beginning there is seasons in our lives brother that we have to understand that in those seasons God is there but you got to look for him you got to seek him and you got to know when he gives you something he'll show you the Revelation for that particular moment amen amen yes sir sometimes he says attack yes sir Hallelujah sometimes he said stand still and see the salvation of sometimes he says wait sometimes he says go brother Bram said in questions and answers the holy spirit is in you for a purpose people don't understand that today that you think that the Holy Ghost like the Pentecostals amen I got the Holy Ghost now got it I got it okay what for

and and in questions and answers brother bam said when you have the Holy Spirit in you it's for a purpose when it says speak you speak when it says go you go that's what it's for and that's the reason

God revealed he said and she will stand hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah Ephesians 6 Ephesians 6 says say after you have done all to stand stand amen amen Ephesians 6 amen where it tells you to

amen don't try to say well I joined the church 10 years ago and I know now and this and that let's move on stand still don't worry about anything else stand still brother bam says I want to read a portion of scripture to give a word or two second chronicles 20 verse 17 that's what we read and he says I want to use this for a text stand still and see the salvation of the lord we are so acquainted these scriptures in this day that we're living we see listen to this church is there such a hustle and a bustle of the people how people are just going from place to place and they're driving amen not knowing where they're going caring less and ramming into each other and Wrecking it seems to be a neurotic age it's time I think that we all Stood Still just for a little while and take inventory of where we are going now in this particular scripture that we just read it was where a great Christ had come see what he says in the scripture that we have just read it was where a great crisis had come the people were all nervous upset because there was a great invading Army the moabites were coming against Judah and it was a strous time and the people were all frustrated they didn't know which way to go Jehoshaphat the righteous man of God he tried to do everything he knew how to serve the Lord and the people were all tore up because there was a great invading Army so many times that we all get to a place where we can stand still and nervous just as we start to do something good then we see trouble coming but that is the devil trying to accept the program of God and we find it in our individual lives we find it in our church and we find it in the nation amen amen did you hear that stand to your feet tonight Hallelujah glor beautiful amen you find it everywhere we can know that when we are getting ready to do right wrong is always present but the way to overcome that is to think in your heart which way God will have you to go which is the best way then stay with that and stay [Music] there so in that great hour of frustration the Lord spoke and he spoke through a little Prophet standing near who said stand still and see the salvation of God you'll not have to fight this battle but as long as they were together and praying God was going to fight the battle and I think the same thing applies tonight in this great hour where the church people are doing fing with each other breaking us up we battle from this side to the other it's time to stand still it's God's battle it's not ours to begin with God wants us to stand still when God gets ready to do anything usually most all the time he commands his people to stand still hallelujah hallelujah amen when he was going to open the Red Sea and the enemy was coming he told him amen told Moses speak amen and people CES to do die there was graves in Egypt there was Graves we could have had a formal funeral better amen hallelujah he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord amen amen when the enemy was gaining ground in the in the promised land and Joshua needed more time he said Son stand still hallelujah hallelujah and see the salvation of the Lord Amen brother says every time that God gets ready to do anything a paradox He commands his people to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord how many know that every time the prophet used the third pool he told him to stand glory to God stand stand stand amen hallelujah hallelujah he was praying in the tree he told him to stand he was praying in the wilderness amen and the storm is getting ready to come down he told him to stand he was in the boat fishing with banks and L Woods wood he told him to stand up he was praying in his home and he told him to stand up amen amen every time he used the third pole he was preaching the Seven Seals and seven Thunders were uttering their voices he was standing the platform behind the pulpit every time he use the third P he will standing amen stand still and see the salvation of the Lord am God is going to perform a paradox amen you got to stand still amen amen if God is going to perform something in the message I have heard but now I see brother bam says it's in the hour of Crisis same thing he said in the other message this scene right here in second chronicles it was an hour of Crisis amen amen in the times of Moses when he come to the Red Sea it was in the time of Crisis that we find inspiration struck them amen amen and God hadn't even spoke to him yet hallu glory to God God what the prophet is God hadn't even spoke to him yet he hadn't gave him instructions he hadn't told him nothing but inspiration struck him in the hour of Christ and he said stand still and see the salvation of God oh my hallelujah amen amen glory to God coming to the Red Sea Joshua he also says in the hour of Crisis Hallelujah in the message I have heard but now I see Joshua was in the hour of crisis when the armies were routed the sun was going down josu was a prophet he knew that the armies he knew that if the armies never had a chance to unite would lose more men and in the hour of Crisis there was only one thing he had to keep them running but there wasn't enough lot to do it so Joshua stood and raised his and he said Son stand still and moon hang over Ed of till I get through with this battle and the sun Stood Still inspiration struck him before that God spoke to him amen hallelujah said the reason they do that is because they knew their Commission brother bam said didn't have to pray he didn't say Lord can I do this he was in the line of duty amen he was in the line of duty he had been raised up for that purpose he was in the will of God he was in the Battle of the Lord amen amen he could command in the line of duty to the inspiration stru and he said Son stand still it's in the hour of Crisis amen that Jehosaphat was crying to God and was saying Lord God Amen what will you do he got the attention of God and this little Prophet as we just read in the message came out and said amen Jael he he came out and he said amen stand still and see the salvation of the Lord go out tomorrow before the enemy and just stand there that's all you got to do stand there and when the enemy comes I will defeat him amen I will destroy them I will kill them glory to God AM stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and we're in the heat of the battle friend we are in the heat of the battle this is a different season and you've got to understand what season we're in amen and in this season God is telling you tonight stand still and see the salvation of Lord heavenly father in this hour God we
