glorify you for that we lift up your Holy Name we bless you oh god oh Father we thank you thank you Lord God we pray now as we enter into your word father that you would have bless Lord the reading of your word you would bless the reader and the hearer of this prophecy it's your promise Lord you have promised it father that whosoever read it whoever hear it the words of this prophecy there Comes A A blessedness with it father we are gathered here Lord with expectations with faith in our heart that as we hear the word we apply Faith Lord by Revelation believing that what is being spoke by your spirit to us Lord is for us so we receive it Lord and we rejoice in it father and father we pray that as your word Goes Forth anything Lord that might be bothering or hindering your people from receiving Lord a greater walk with you a closer walk we believe that there's power in your word father and as your word Goes Forth Lord May those things be driven away the power of your word any sicknesses in the bodies Lord as the word Goes Forth without laying on of hands as Peter yet spake these words as he as Peter preached to the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius the Holy Ghost fell father we pray as your prophet Lord come to the service one day many sick many in stretchers many in wheelchairs great diseases but he said I I I made up my mind that morning to come to the platform and just preach the word and not touch nobody and as I preach the word they begin to get up they begin to get healed there's power in your word your Prophet has taught us that this message has come lord it's it's your word father to teach us to instruct us to give us Lord leadership and know what we're doing father the the the hearer the lay member the minister the worker anyone father that might know what their call is as your children father we come here gathered in one Faith one Spirit one mind one Unity of the faith and that is Lord that you have sent the greatest Revelation to unveil your own self for to us the Mighty God unveiled before us not everybody not the whole world not all the churches but the Mighty God unveiled before us the bride oh Father we thank you we praise your Holy Name father because we see your love towards us Lord how much you loved us that you sent your son Lord you you you paid the price you shed your blood and then father that was the purchase but Lord you come back in this end time to claim what you have bought father now through this message through this Revelation you're claiming your own father we thank you for that father as we open your word bless each one help me Father Lord may you speak to your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning amen I me love the lord it's good to be in the presence of the Lord amen amen hallelujah hallelujah to come with that expectation amen and know that we come to see him Amen Let Us open our Bibles God bless each one in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Jeremiah chapter 3 as we continue with uh what we were looking at Wednesday I wasn't able to to conclude or finish that um amen and there was things in there that uh had to be a little bit more clear and be able to see we saw a little bit but be able to see more clearly how that applies today more perfectly because these uh these areas here in the scripture is only a shadow to show us the reality of today of what was causing the shadow amen Jeremiah chapter 3 Allelujah verse one amen you all have it Hallelujah we we titled it Wednesday the glory was shaven and the glory has risen upon you so Jeremiah 3:1 says they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man's shall he return unto her again shall not the land be great polluted but thou has played the Harlot with many lovers yet return again to me sayth the Lord lift up thine eyes unto the the high places and see where thou Hast not been laying with in the ways has thou set for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou Hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness therefore the showers have been withholding and there have been no latter rain and thou had us a horse forehead thou refuses to be ashamed amen Jeremiah chap s and we're going to read verse 28 but Thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the Lord have rejected and forsaken the generation of his Wrath [Music] may be seated God bless you we go back to Jeremiah 3 just to pick up uh something there amen amen we have been now for some time I believe a month or so or a little bit more on U the study of Ezekiel and we have seen many great things and one thing that throughout the the series that we have looked at is how that Jeremiah is the major prophet that is prophesying at the same time and Jeremiah is also one that is taken into Babylon under the Captivity Jeremiah uh was given the prophecy first and he is the one that's giving the message and Ezekiel is the only one that is picking up with jermiah has already said and he is he is repeating it uh not only as we we said not only just repeating but also with the same vision with the same Revelation and with the same urgency and uh that is a perfect type of our day and there is a a tremendous tremendous uh Insight in this in this uh time yeah there's a there's a tremendous scene that you see during this time and it allows you to be able to to look at this type of this shadow and see more clearly certain things that the opening of the book allows you to see Hallelujah when the book is open the book is the Bible brother Bram said it wasn't no other book that was seal with Seven Seals the book that was sealed with Seven Seals was the Bible it wasn't another uh different book that God had in heaven there's only one book amen amen and that book where our names are written is the Bible that's why a lot of people say where is William Brandon's name in the Bible William Bram in it's there do you see William branham's name in the Bible will amen you see it by Revelation but it doesn't say William Bram will your name if you're a part of the Bride your name is in the Bible but you have to see it by Revelation and that's what the opening of the book does it allows you to see brother bam said the the book is not calling names like Orman Neville and Le he said what is it he said it's the mystery being revealed that calls your name each one of these characters is representing somebody amen but the first [Music] revelation that you must understand that's why Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church because that's the first stone that must be laid and it has already been laid but in your life in your Christian walk if you want to be able to advance with God you have to have that Revelation and that is that the mystery of God being revealed it reveals Jesus Christ it doesn't reveal somebody else first if it doesn't reveal Jesus Christ you're not seeing it correctly because brother Randon preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed and then he preached Christ revealed in his own word amen amen and brother Bram said we must be able to see Christ first before you can see anything else and that's what is the foundation of the faith of the fathers and this message was to take us back to that faith and establish us upon the same Foundation that they had that's why the ministry of the son of man had to come back and reveal the same Ministry of Jesus Christ again amen amen and what do we see in that Ministry we don't see a man we see Christ revealed in a man the man is not Christ the man is not God the man is only revealing to the public the through the fullness of the manifestation of the son of man he is showing us Christ but brother Bram said we cannot Approach To God In The Name of William Bren those are the words of the Prophet we cannot try to come to God and say I'm coming on this behalf there's only one way to approach God and that way has been open the light shines the path amen amen and it shows you how to approach God and what people Miss many times is that the prophet wasn't to take us to some other thing outside of the word but because brother Branham was taught by the angel of the Lord it was the pillar of fire that revealed to him the Bible amen amen in the message the unveiling of God he says it was the pillar of fire over Moses while he wrote on Mount Si Genesis who knew all those things who knew that there was a a serpent in the beginning in Genesis a beast that spoke to Eve and deceived her and she ate of the fruit the pillar of fire over Moses had him WR in the beginning amen amen the heavens and the Earth right and God said let there be light and the the spirit of God moved upon the waters was Moses there to see that the pillar of fire over Moses is what revealed to him what that was then brother Bram said the pillar of fire over Paul revealed to him the Old Testament amen amen and that's why the New Testament was given by Paul not by Matthew Mark Luke and John they were only scribes observing the son of man Ministry and saying wow look at that Ministry and taking down what was taking place that that had a part because we can go back into Matthew Mark luk and John and see the life of the son of man then compare that to this day but brother bam tells us the one who brought the New Testament was Paul and the pillar of fire was the one that met him on the road to Damascus and then after that he went to the Arabian Desert that's in the book of Galatians chapter 1 right amen Paul tells us his testimony of his conversion and then how he went to Arabia and he he was there and Paul says I did not consult Flesh and Blood I didn't go to Jerusalem with the brothers with Peter and James and the rest of the brothers I didn't go see them he went by himself to the desert and the pillar of fire revealed to him the ministry of Jesus revealed to him he was the lamb he was the tabernacle he was the veil he was the ark he was all of the Old Testament Paul is the one that brought the Revelation to show us the old test was the shadow Christ is the substance right who taught him that the pillar of fire and in that same message that I'm quoting brother bam after he shows us that Moses by the pillar of fire wrote the Old Testament the pillar of fire over Paul gave him the New Testament he said and today that same Pillar of Fire has come to reveal to us Old and New Testament by the revelation of this message Hallelujah why why do I why do I start by saying that because the pillar of fire teaching William brandom the the Bible revealing to him the Bible from Genesis to Revelation that's the message amen you understand so what's the message amen it's the pillar of fire giving the message revealing the Bible to William brandham William BR and William brandham cannot speak Willi according to himself and according to the Bible cannot speak something outside of the Bible he said I used to think spiritual food in due season I used to think and I and me Diego a royal used to think too and a lot of you used to think too amen that there were that that the message was something more than the Bible and that there was things that weren't in the Bible that are in the message you might still think like that I don't know but that's okay because William brandham thought like that too amen amen we thought like that too at one time because people in the message influence that amen and they take away the essence of what the message really is and that's why people I don't blame a lot of people they think that we're a cult they think that we we we we we're we're like the Mormons right M the Mormons carry two books and really they only carry one they don't really care about the Old Testament they just want the New Testament and the Book of Mormon brother bam said that angel that comes to me he said it in the seals amen if that angel tells me one thing outside of the Bible I'll never listen to him again he said I don't doubt that that angel came to Joseph Smith in Upstate New York amen I don't doubt that brother Bram said but he wasn't scriptural that angel that spoke to Joseph Smith Joseph Smith not just one time time after time and begin to to teach him all that's in the Book of Mormon how many's heard or read or know a little bit about the Book of Mormon brother there's things in there they're strange amen very strange so the thing is Galatians 18 Paul who brought the New Testament and knew brother Ram said Paul knew that what he was preaching wasn't wasn't his own it was the revelation of Jesus Christ he says it in Galatians 1 he said the the the gospel that I preach is not of man because it wasn't given to me by man he says and what I preach I Don't Preach to please men amen a lot of people preach because they like to please men amen amen but we're not to please men we're to please God and if and if the elected seed loves God Amen and if God is pleased you will be pleased amen because you and him are one and without faith it's impossible to please him but Paul said I preached the revelation of Jesus Christ and brother Adam said he was so certain what he was preaching was not anything had to do with man that he said even if an angel from heaven comes down and preaches another gospel then what I have already established let him be a curse and Paul says even if I after so many years even if I he said turn around and preach something contrary to what I have already preached I'm cursed amen amen hallelujah that shows you that it wasn't his because if that would have been of human origin he would have said whoa I'm always right if I change I'm still right but no he knew that's the word of the Lord reveal red preached amen amen by the foolishness of preaching amen and that same Pillar of Fire right there that Pillar of Fire is what met Saul on the road to Damascus that Pillar of Fire was in the burning bush that spoke to Moses and said I am that I am am that same Pillar of Fire come back in this day to reveal the Old Testament and the New Testament not something outside of the Bible not Le come to brother Bram brother Bram tells us in the unveiling of God 1964 said brother Bram you can write another Bible with all the Revelation you've received he said brother I would be an antichrist am and brother bam said I always thought because the message is what the seventh angel sounding the trumpet is that the message amen amen okay but why do why does revelation 10:7 say that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you know how that verse begins right you know how it begins right Revelation 107 how does that verse begin but in the days why why is it but in the days because before from verse one to verse three you see a mighty angel with the rainbow over his head clothed in a cloud coming down from heaven with the book open in his hand that's that Pillar of Fire but in Angelic form Hallelujah the angel of God the angel of the Covenant coming with the Revelation that's Christ not corporally but angelically do you have an angel amen does Christ have an angel yes see his Angel has come amen amen amen and it says and he put one foot on the land one on the sea and he roared with a loud voice as when a lion roared and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John said I was about to write what the seven Thunders UT and that angel said don't write it seal it Hallelujah but in the days amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the trumpet am the mystery of God will be finished am am brother bam said and and you you read messages from 1960 61 even 62 amen amen and brother bham because he he confesses it later that's why we know amen he confesses it later he says I used to think that those seven Thunders was something outside of the Bible and that was never written he says but it cannot be so amen amen he says but we found out by the grace of God that it was something hidden in the Bible it's there but it's hidden so that's what the message is we're not following some unscriptural thing amen this is this is what God promised for the end time amen amen that's just like when when Moses was back there with the children of Israel amen amen that was the word of the Lord hallelujah you believe it or you die that's it that's like when the days of Noah you either believed his message obeyed his message walked into the ark oh you're done amen oh that's it and that's what this is the message of the hour what we call the brother bam called it the message of the hour that's what it is is directly from God just like Paul brother bam said anointed ones at the end time I have nothing to do with this that's what he said he said it wasn't me that appeared at the River Ohio I was just a voice standing there when it happened it was he said it hasn't been me that has revealed these things the seventh angel is not the son of man the seventh angel is revealing to the public the son of man amen see and brother bam said with his words that's where people have a hard time separating amen you talk about the son of man and they and they're looking at the seventh angel see what I'm saying but but if you look at it correctly that's all right because a lot of people can't see that but it's a dangerous thing and then that's why others say no I don't want to get into none of that it takes too much no it takes God it doesn't take take a lot of study it takes God to reveal it to you Hallelujah you got to see it by Revelation amen amen but people don't want to do that because to do that you need to die out to a lot of thoughts you got to lay yourself before the son and let the Rays of light going to strike into the seed begin to ripen amen begin to see clear and it's all the the beautiful thing of it is that you know this ain't you making this up it's all right there in the word it's all right there in the message it's all right there in the Bible and and and you can see it in one one part here and God showing you that but but with that one with that Revelation there God can brother bam said this is the words of the Prophet when he dedicated the exposition of the church ages he dedicated the book amen thank you H Allelujah amen amen and in the introduction he wrote something that wasn't something he preached he dedicated it for that book and he wrote in the introduction this study of the seven Church ages is necessary for further revelation want to start over here he said you got to start here you see because from the church ages after the church Jesus come the seals after the seals come the trumpets after the trumpets come the vials that's what he wrote that's what he wrote and you look at look at it in the Book of Revelation what's at the first part of the Book of Revelation apocalypsis Church ages amen it was in chapter 4 and chapter 5 after church ages in chapter five the lamb takes the book opens the seals chapter six the seals you understand and then what chapter eight the trumpets right amen amen amen and then after the trumpets the vials brother Ram knew what he's talking about but he just says it because he's seeing it and if you hear what he says or read what he wrote and you say Church ages seals trumpets BS amen amen but you're not seeing what he's seeing you understand what I'm saying you're not seeing why he said it brother Adam said that's why today there's a lot of trouble why because there's too many directors that are not in the spirit of the composer amen you got to enter into the spirit of the composer Hallelujah he says if not you're looking at the at the sheet notes yes and you're saying g c amen amen if right but there's a certain way brother Bram said it Shalom message shom you got to know when to change how many strokes in G Strokes if you're playing the guitar amen amen you're not just going to be changing g c d e f f e e there's a purpose there's there's a time when change and brother bham said everybody must be in this in in the in the spirit is that what he taught us hallelujah so people just grab the sheet note spiritually speaking and they say GCF GCF right but they don't know when it change you got to enter into the spirit of the composer brother said it's like like like Peter and the Wolf right amen remember he told us he said the drums had to play a certain way everything had a a certain a certain thing to do but you got to enter into the spirit of the composer you got to learn the Rhythm you got to learn the changes when it goes High when it gets low when it stops when it goes when it starts again amen right who taught us that amen amen so is not just to look at it and repeat it or or read it it's to enter into that same channel and then when you go to the Book of Revelation oh wow that's why he said that and then he says and the whole revelation will open wide that's what he said will open wide before our wondering eyes amen amen amen it's a picture that's the reason why see I'm I'm doing this because I'm showing you the purpose how many understand I'm showing you the purpose in why when we study books like this in the Bible there's a purpose it's not that we're in some history lesson this is helping us to see more clear the picture and brother Ram told us Jeremiah is a type of Christ is Jeremiah type of Christ Jeremiah purchased an inheritance of his uncle ham ham right amen he bought he purchased the land and told Baro amen amen to keep the title deed of that property in an earn vessel for 70 years brother bam preached those things where did he get it from right here from the book of Jeremiah see but people just hear the prophet they don't go back to see where he got it from to see what he's reading you see what I'm saying that's that's the mistake a lot of us make amen amen but when we go back like this and we see oh look at this you begin to see the picture and then you see the message and and you look at the quotes and you see exactly what brother Bram was seeing you see what I'm saying then you understand why he said what he said his basis his his foundation from where he was getting that was from here he he says I I didn't go to school I didn't go to theology I didn't go study for years and years to the Seminary who taught him the Bible the pillar of fire hallelujah it's not about theology it's about understanding what we're looking at what we're hearing what we're reading and that is the spirit of wisdom that the Bible speaks of in the book of Ephesians the spirit of wisdom and revelation will illuminate the eyes of your understanding is that the Bible is that the scripture and preach on that he said that Spirit of wisdom and Revelation was going to come in the last days to open our eyes to the Revelation hallelujah hallelujah oh brother this is this is real this is this is sound Hallelujah that's why the Bible said in the last days there would be many with itching ears brother bam said that's how Eve got her eyes blinded they want to hear something El something new ain't nothing new outside of this amen outside of this ain't another light but the light has come to open this it shall be light in the evening time and there's a fountain that's flowing flowing flowing it does not stop and the spirit and the prophet and the bride it's saying come there's a fountain where is that Fountain it's in the word the fountain is open and it's flowing healing Revelation Holy Ghost joy peace hallelujah amen whatever you need is in this Fountain you say oh brother I don't know what to do come to the Fountain and drink from the water I'm sick come to the Fountain Jeremiah said to to the people of his day remember last Sunday night you have forsaken the Fountain of Living Life life and you have made for yourselves sisters broken sisters did Brother Bram preach broken sister Jeremiah was a shadow of William Bram William Jeremiah is a type also of Jesus [Music] Christ Jeremiah had the Ministry of the son of man amen he bought the land who paid the price for us Christ Jeremiah paid the price and then he told Baro the title of that property amen keep it in an earn vessel for 70 years until after the Captivity what is 70 years remember we' preached on Daniel before what is the 70 years it's 10 is seven decades amen what's a decade A decade is 10 years right is that right a century is 100 years a decade is 10 years so what's 70 years seven decades what is the 70 years of captivity it's a type of the seven Church ages Jeremiah paid the price before for 70 years and then he told keep the title and hide it preserve it in an earth and vessel until after the Captivity and after the Captivity take it out again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah have 70 years passed Ephesus Mna pergamus tartara Sardis Philadelphia L here and and the book the title deed come back out hallelujah hallelujah but this time is not to purchase again Jesus Christ doesn't have to die he hasn't he doesn't have to come back and and be crucified again no that's already happened but now they crucify the word not the flesh the word not the flesh the word not the prophet the word amen but this time amen amen that same one that paid the price come in spirit form and he's claiming this is my property Hallelujah this is my bride I paid the price for this bride she belongs to me in the first seal brother bam said the King has come down to get gather his subjects and in this Gathering what's the message remember the message the Rapture he said the first thing that when the Lord does when he descends is a shout what is a shout a message what is the message to gather amen what is the seven Thunders to gather the bride for caping Faith hallelujah what is this message it's the king Gathering his subjects hallelujah hallelujah for what to take them to his kingdom glor Hallelujah glory to God oh my so when we're looking at Jeremiah that's how you're looking at Jeremiah you're not looking at Jeremiah like the denominations look at Jeremiah you're not looking at Ezekiel as somebody else looks at Ezekiel when you're reading Ezekiel and Jeremiah you you have that picture in your mind amen you understand amen right so that's why you that's why you you get out of it that's why you can get something out of it and if you're not looking it at that way you can't get nothing out of it you just say what what it talking about Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Babylon and and Nebuchadnezzar that you don't see the picture you're not seeing what it is you now you you understand a little bit better amen that's why the the whole series we've been seeing Ezekiel is only [Music] repeating what Jeremiah already said he's in the same realm that Jeremiah Was right Lord help me I already preached uh half of my time and I even started I just wanted to show you the the purpose behind this this whole teaching hallelujah how many how many enjoy it hallelujah amen it helps us to to understand that these things are scriptural you see Christ you see the prophet and you see yourself what's Revelations 10 Christ seventh angel and John right what's in Genesis Abraham Abraham elzer El and Rebecca Rebecca Hallelujah and Isaac is right that brother bam said the seven seal runs through the whole Bible and what he say the seven seal is seven seal P of the trumpets is revelation 10 Revelation 10 apocalypsis silence in heaven yes that's chapter eight but chapter 10 brother Bram said the Thunders didn't thunder in heaven they thunder on the earth silence in heaven but on the earth there's a message being preached serpent SE Christ is the mystery of God revealed first seal second seal amen marriage and divorce SE is not air with the shot God does not change his mind about his word amen amen I have heard but now I see this day this scur fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah seven Thunders amen sounding Out glory to God yes sir amen amen that's the beauty of this hallelujah hallelujah oh my this message is what's going to take us out of here amen this Revelation I ain't making this up this is the scripture this is the message this message is going to change our body one of these days and people say I don't want to know know nothing about that I just want to go in the Rapture that's how you're going to go hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and because I want to go I want more and more and more Hallelujah light upon light Hallelujah revelation after Revelation until one of these days hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram said we'll blend into eternity and leave these three dimensions because heaven is right here in another dimension Hallelujah we don't have to fly far far right here we just change dimensions and that's it hallelujah hallelujah glory to God in these messages in these tapes it's rapturing Faith Hallelujah that's that faith in the heart of the children Malachi 4 behold I sent to you Elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father hallelujah hallelujah what other Ministry has done that there is no other Ministry Vindicated by God to do the work of Elijah the prophet amen not one can produce not even 10% of what that Ministry did Hallelujah but people say how come denominations don't know about it you know why at first they loved him come come to our church amen come to our meetings amen amen because they're looking at people they're looking at money they they want multitude they're looking at numbers they're looking at money they're looking at growing amen amen but they interested in truth they're not interested in Revelation they're not interested in nothing else and when that Ministry turned around and begin to blast their organizations that's Antichrist brother Adam said you believe me when I say that sayth the Lord you're healed he says you believe that he said but but that same one that revealed that you're healed when that one says thus sayth the Lord Trinity baptism is anti he said that you don't believe well the same one that showed the vision that you're healed when he was born what accident he had what the doctor told him that same one told the prophet that same one revealed the Bible and he said thus sayth the Lord serpent SE thus say the Lord this is the true baptism in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that same Angel Hallelujah hallelujah oh but they just want the healing they they just want yes we want the bread and the fish hallelujah hallelujah amen multitudes following Jesus amen we want more fish we want more bread but then he turned around and he said I am my father one glory to God if you don't receive me you're dead you'll die in your sins they said our fathers yeah at man in the wilderness and and and you say that you're greater than Moses show us a miracle greater than that he said I am the bread of life hallelujah hallelujah if you eat eat from me you shall never die but your fathers they ate bread and every one of them are [Applause] dead brother what's a greater miracle healing visions and all these oh people like that they they like that but when it comes to the miracle of the word what's that I mean I don't know what that is brother brandham always taught us he always taught us the word is above everything and everything else has got to be judged by the word and who revealed the word the prophet there's no higher office to reveal the word than a prophet he reveals the word because he ain't speaking what he thinks the word means he is saying directly thus say the Lord why because the Lord speaks to the prophet in that manner you understand people don't know what the message is they just think it's you know another religion and we follow the message and and we and you know we just we believe in the message Amen brother this is the word or it ain't the word this is either true or it's false this is either something to die for and live for or don't follow it at all brother brother bam said speaking to the critics he said if the apostles [Music] planned the death of Jesus he said why would they give their life for it if if it was false that's what the prophet said if they knew that it was just a play it was fake Jesus didn't really raise from the dead it was all fake brother B says then tell me if they knew that it was Fai why did they die for that amen willing to die for something that you know is not real I I can understand if you're dece and you think it's right and it's not right you can die like that I'll die for this and it's false but you're ignorant but the critic was saying that they planned it all out amen he said they would never have died for that but each one of them gave their life amen amen oh brother oh Jeremiah 3 oh my Hallelujah I was trying to start there Lord to God Jeremiah 3 stress amen amen glor hallelujah we we touched this uh uh Wednesday so notice now he is is saying here return amen he he is saying here return return see he is still calling amen amen for her to come back Hallelujah even though she's in that condition he's willing to take her how many know that's the love of God hallelujah how many remember when we preached in the book of Hosea amen when God tells the propheta his is is in whoredom they're in prostitution right but I want to redeem her remember that the book of Hosea and he says but you're my representative you're my Prophet you represent me on the earth so I want you God sending the prophet to go among amongst the whoredoms amen amen go down there to that zone and get a prostitute and marry her God tell amen and have children with her and I'm going to tell you how to name your children the first name of your children is going to be this God SS God SS the seed amen amen and on and on he was showing Israel how he was to redeem it back but in this case here he's telling telling her to return return return to me sayth the Lord why because she she has lovers she has other gods other idols and because of all of this verse three the showers have been withholden remember we touched that Wednesday if you want the reference of that Deuteronomy 11 verses 13 to 14 God in the law told the children of Israel by Moses when you enter into the land that I have promised you you got to follow my word if you don't follow my word and if if you don't do what I have commanded I will hold back the rain but if you do what I have commanded I will send rain in due season and and that rain is what Without Rain there's no agriculture Without Rain there's no prosperity Without Rain there's no corn there there's no there's no grain there's no wheat there's no wine there's no oil but he says I will send rain you will have wheat you'll have wine and you'll have oil amen amen I sin former rain what's the former rain it's Mor the brother B taught us the Hebrew word for former rain is Mor he said what is that sewing the seed it's teaching rain it's the seed going into the ground and the rain falling at that time that's former rain he says and then there's a latter rain that's for the Harvest after it has come out of the ground after it has budded after it's given the fruit and it needs the last rain brother bam said that's the latter rain the latter rain is for the Harvest it's the last rain before the Harvest former rain and latter R and we are promised in the Book of Joel chapter 2 that in this age we were going to be sent it was going to be sent to us amen amen former rain and latter rain in the same month and that month is the month of April and that month of April is the spring time and that and that spring time is a type of the resurrection and that Resurrection has come in the evening time to resurrect us out of dark denominationalism after the winter the cold has killed all of the botney life in the spring time the flower comes out again amen the trees amen give its fruit again in the spring time there's Resurrection amen so Joel chapter 2 says I will send former rain and latter rain at the same time I will restore sayth the Lord so this message has those two rains the the message teaches us the son of man Ministry is the S who was the swer the son of man who SED the seed Matthew 13 the S is the son of man right so to sew the seed there was needed rain reain of teaching Hallelujah and that teaching is what Jesus taught the disciples he was teaching them the works that I do you shall do also that was a seed being planted he was teaching them I come from my father I'm here on the earth I'm going to leave the Earth and go back to the father he was teaching amen amen there's something coming I got to go so that this power can fill you amen amen and you can continue he was teaching them that's the teaching but then brother Adam said on the day of Pentecost what they had been taught what they had been planted amen now it was time in the book of Acts to give the fruits of what they had been taught in the book of Acts is the fruits of what Jesus taught them that's why I believe that this message has got to produce something in your life amen do you believe that do you believe this message has something in it that will take the church and Christ in the church will write another book of Acts is that what the prophet said Christ in the church will be another book of Acts amen hallelujah there will be a church without sin a sin-free church hallelujah amen that there's no three kinds of [Applause] Believers there's only believers do you believe that amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah because in the upper room Judas was gone amen amen the unbelievers didn't even get close to Judas they weren't in the picture no more amen amen and for 20 years after they still weren't in the picture he acts chapter 4 it says that when an ananas and Safara died because they tried to do some kind of false thing there lies and schemes and money hu they died Peter said why have you lied to the Holy Spirit see he knew what was inside of him but there were telling him they weren't telling Holy Spirit this is the money we have no they told Peter Peter we sold our property and this is our money amen amen Peter said why have you lied to the holy spirit amen amen and she died right he died amen amen and they buried him read the Bible they buried him before his wife wife could get to church that's how long she took to get to church she was running late that morning amen and by the time she got to church Hallelujah her husband was dead buried already didn't Peter say that when she got there she said what what happened where's my husband they said they the men already left to bury him and you have participated in the same and she died right there too they buried her and the Bible says that they were already on their way back they had already buried ananas they came back and Peter said bury her too so they took her but but the point is that the people heard this and they feared to be part of that little church they didn't want to get close to that it wasn't a a very inviting church but for the predestinated seed it's an attraction Hallelujah for the world if I go there and I have sin in my life I can die like this I don't want to go brother bam said thus sayith the Lord that same thing will come back to the church amen that's either truth or it's not truth there's going to be a free a sin-free church amen and that's why that's why we're we're contending amen amen that's why we got to keep the word before the people I can't change you I can't do something to change you but I can present the word and show you what the word has called us to do in this hour so latter rain is rapturing faith resume of the ages brother bam said what will happen to the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people back to where they were at the beginning that's thus sayth the Lord and thus sayth the Lord is Joel 223 see and he reads the Scripture it is thus sayth the Lord for it is what Joel 223 to 26 says I will sin former rain and I will cause to come down the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month what's the first month for Israel in the book of Exodus chapter 12 that's when their calendar began in The Exodus not in captivity but in the time of The Exodus God told Moses this will be your first month abib hallelujah amen and this will be the time on the 12th day amen amen you shall leave so that's April so he says here I will sin former rain and lighter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil I will restore to you all the years that the Locust have eaten the caterpillar the Palmer worm all this corruption and sin that entered through the church ages after the church ages restore back that first church amen amen he's not going to he says it right here he's not going to plant a new church no no but he's going to bring his original plan back to the original seed he is doing it at is as it stated in verse 23 by the by the teaching former rain and next will come the Harvest rain the latter rain or the same as rapturing F hallelujah hallelujah so latter rain amen is rapturing Faith and the reason that Jeremiah is prophesying here telling the church you have no lad why because you're in prostitution there's no rapturing faith where their lovers is something other than the word who is God the word who is saying return to me God is saying that he's speaking to Israel Jerusalem as his wife because they are in Covenant relation amen amen is did God make a covenant with Israel did he swear by his word that he was going to keep them that they were going to be his people that's a covenant just like marriage amen amen amen For Better or For Worse and this is the worst amen still in the worst he's saying come back return and forsake all those lovers and I will receive you right but we showed Wednesday that God's patience God's longsuffering amen amen Runs Out how many know that that say we showed it Wednesday right the same thing Jesus with Jerusalem right oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem the same thing with the prophet in this age oh United States Oh California Oh California oh how I tried amen amen to gather you as the hind of Brew hallelujah amen but you would not he said now judgment is Strike right didn't he say that we we we preached it Wednesday but I I wanted to start here amen amen but when we go to chapter seven remember God tells Jeremiah in verse 16 that no longer to pray for this people God is not accepting intercession for her no more there was a time that he was calling her but that time of calling isn't forever God calls return return return but she would not so what did Jesus say now the armies are going to Compass jerus and he told the elect when you see that Flee for Your Life Now judgment was going to strike and the prophet told us when this ecumenical council brings the squeeze that will be the time to manifest the testimony of the third pool amen am to preach to the eternally lost because there's no more Mercy there no more salvation he that is filthy filthy still he that is Holy be holy still amen amen they've crossed a line between mercy and judgment but God will keep the church after the door is closed for a little while as a testimony to the eternally lost amen amen amen not for salvation Jesus third had a third pool did he have a third pool yes what was his third pool preaching to the eternally [Music] lost amen am and brother Ram said the third pool will be man manifested in the squeeze but you got to understand that a third pool was in process first he spoke things into existence by that third pool amen amen he spoke to the storm did Jesus do the same that was the third pull in Jesus amen amen but that was just in portion and then what was the next thing brother Bram said the next part of the third pool after speaking into existence after the spoken word power there's a next step to the third po anointing on at the end time amen amen in The Sixth Seal he also revealed it he said what was that the opening of the word the third pool open the Seven Seals that was the third pool in operation the revealing of the mystery amen amen hallelujah and he said in questions and answers on the seals while he's preaching the seals in the Tabernacle he said there's something happening here nobody's catching it he said but if you can understand it's the third pool see but carinal people they don't want to take those things they just want to point literal literal literal literal it is not only literal it is spiritual yes sir the prophet shows you that and when that spiritual revelation of that third pool was an operation nobody caught it he said but this is going to come back around remember we' preached on that amen amen the cycle will return again he was in that cycle he says but it's going to come back and he says and when it does amen amen he said if you have a crystal if you have a gene in your soul if you're predestinated this is only for the seed it's ain't for nobody else it's a secret hallelujah hallelujah the angel told him don't reveal it publicly I will reveal it not you I will show the people I will teach the people what the third pull is because of this there's no impersonation amen amen and that's why amen amen anybody can impersonate laying on of hands Mark 16 first pool anybody can impersonate there's there's an old man here that that that his body hurts hallelujah what old man amen doesn't body doesn't hurt my body hurts and I ain't that old amen but there rose up a lot of impersonations amen oh my [Music] discernment so called but the angel told him I told you not to teach the people you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things is that right amen so that was a second part of the third pool what about what's the last part what's the last part of the third pool first part Jesus cursed the tree he stopped the storm amen amen spoken word second part Matthew 24 he told the disciples let's go to the Mount olives brother Bram said there Jesus preached the Seven Seals did Jesus preach the Seven Seals read read or listen the six seals and brother Ram says it right there in the six seal he preached the Seven Seals the opening of the word that's the second part of the third pool amen amen but what was the third souls in prison now Jesus is third pool after the crucifixion he went to hell and preach those souls in prison you understand that why am I saying that because this is right here in the book of Jeremiah but listen to something this this came fresh this Revelation came last night amen Jeremiah is seeing that don't God tells him remember we've already spoke on this but he tells him don't pray for this people Jeremiah 729 the same Prophet that was telling Jerusalem return return thus say the Lord you're in prostitution but return I'll still receive you but now he tells him in in verse 29 cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem and cast it away and take up lamentation on high places for the Lord have rejected and forsaken the generation of his Wrath he's done with that generation and William brandham this is what I'm trying to show you Jeremiah a type of Christ son of man and that same Ministry repeated again in the seventh angel right so Jeremiah is a type of Christ and a type of the seven Jeremiah sees that time hey Mercy is over souls in prison now but the last grp brother sister Hallelujah the other part to preaching to the Eternal lost he says that right there you see I hope you catch this that right there you find in the Book of Ezekiel you catch it he find you find it in the Book of Ezekiel because Jeremiah after this he steps back he doesn't continue he stops right there Jeremiah in the Bible you see that in the ministry of Jeremiah and he waits he only Waits but then at that time is when Ezekiel catches that Revelation I hope you're understanding this and Ezekiel becomes in the final voice to the final age Hallelujah you catch it Amen brother sister this is so perfect it's and it's right here in the Bible it's right here Jeremiah's Ministry is so perfect the shadow cannot cannot show something different of what the real thing is Amen brother bam said remember when he talks about Shadows he said if there's a shadow of an El elephant he said I can't expect a lion to come out right if I'm looking at the Shadow and I still don't see the the what's causing the shadow come out right and I see the shadow here and the thing that's causing is back there but I look at the shadow I see oh look it has a figure I can't expect what going to come out to be something different than what it's reflecting amen I got to expect the same thing right so it's the same thing here if this is the shadow I can't expect something different today o amen and people try to make up things because they have already fixed a way to see it and when something else comes up and they can't make it fit they make it fit but it it doesn't go there the the piece of the puzzle is too hard amen right how many know the word is a puzzle how many know there's pieces in the puzzle that look like it goes in a certain place and it has the same shapes and everything but you put it in there it's hard right and then you try to move it and it moves the whole thing right amen it doesn't go there doesn't go there and that's what people do with teaching why do I say that why do I say that because right here is showing us the shadow so when you come over here to the days of Jesus you say okay this is what people have made up then if that Ministry that stopped the storm that preached the seals then he has to go down to Hell speaking of this time he has to go to hell again in this ageu to go preach to to the ones that are in Hell see that's a that's a good human reasoning that's that's pretty good but it ain't the word that's why in that same message brother bam teaches us a revelation and what is that Revelation hell is being created right here on the earth so there's no necessity to go down amen understand like Jesus did because Revelation chapter n says that the bottomless pit was open and 200 million demons come out and the prophet said the preaching I'm I'm telling you what the prophet said not what I think I've already preached it in this series remember ezekiel's testimony to the Eternal lost right ezekiel's testimony to the eternally lost and I read the quotes amen where brother Ram said God will keep the church is that what he said God will keep the church here on the Earth after the door is closed and brother Bram prayed Lord give the church the ministry remember I read it of the testimony to the Eternal law and then later on he said she will remain to be a witness and to preach to the eternally lost here on the Earth is that is that third pool is that third pool that can't be impersonated how can you impersonate something that you're not in other words how can you be a witness Amen to the Eternal lost if you're Eternal loss Hallelujah if you're a deceived Church by the world amen amen if if you know that the door is closed and you don't have the Holy Ghost according to the Bible you're going to be looking for that oil you're not going to be testifying to the Eternal loss no the foolish virgin ain't going to be trying to impersonate and she if she knows she she ain't ready for the Rapture amen amen because of false teaching brother Ram said in the seven seal false teaching kept the foolish virgin here but she's of the same material of the Bride amen amen now I'm closing with this now but but I'm showing you something you amen this this is so beautiful this this is so beautiful because the foolish virgin according to Matthew 25 will be looking for the oil amen she'll be looking for the oil so she can't impersonate being a witness to the eternally lost you understand that's the foolish virgin what about the Lost they're lost they're looking for salvation right and there's only three classes of people so the only other group that's left is the bride you understand and she because of her life or should I say his life in her she will be a witness that will be a testimony that she's in the ark and not outside the ark brother bam said God closed the door not Noah not his wife not his kids God closed the door and when God Clos the door Noah and his family stayed in the ark with the door closed and it still did not rain I think it was seven or 10 days right amen it didn't rain brother Ram said that that little part right there in the scripture in the shadow is to show you that that same thing will repeat again amen amen and there will be a little a little period of time before tribulation starts before the bride leaves that he will keep her here and show the people on the outside that she is sealed on the inside amen amen but the door ain't open for the people to come in that's not the purpose when Jesus went to preach to the souls he didn't went to to pull them out of purgatory and take them to Heaven no he went only to preach to the lost that had no more salvation it wasn't for salvation it wasn't for repentance that preaching was testimony amen you understand and brother Ram said just like Jeremiah now I see the picture he says I have to lay back I have to wait because he said if I continue in my Ministry his next step was to preach to the eternally L that was his next step and he knew that I already spoke the word created squirrels God did I stopped the storm God the seals have already been open my next step is to preach to the eternally lost so if I continue that's what's next but God told him don't continue wait Hallelujah brother that's precious that is precious hallelujah amen stand your feet but Ezekiel they caught the message of Jeremiah and understood what Jeremiah Was where he was my and Jer Jemiah told Jerusalem thus sayith the Lord shave your head 1 Corinthians 11 verse 15 says the hair is her Glory Hallelujah is her glory glor shave eel saw the temple and he saw the Glory Hallelujah raise up and leave this what Jeremiah preached Ezekiel was seeing it God didn't divorce Le in 200 16 huh no no he divorced her a long time ago yes he divorced her God right here through the ministry of Jeremiah divorces Jerusalem puts her away amen amen cut off your hair in other words the hair on the woman is a sign of submission and subjection to the Head yes sir don't get amen don't get quiet on me now amen the hair on the woman's head amen amen is a sign of subjection Wednesday we touched how that the hair of the woman without that hair or prayers are not heard is that right amen amen is that the Bible amen the prayers or not in other words God said now before I was calling you come come but now cut off your hair even if you prayed to me according to my word I cannot hear you Mercy's over time is done cut off your hair oh Jerusalem I have forsaken this generation I have rejected this generation the generation of my wrath rejected the voice of God through William Bram how did they reject the husband the bridegroom's voice was speaking through elaser brother Bram said the call of the bridegroom will come through Luke 1730 where did he say it proven his word the bridegroom call so the voice of the bridegroom amen amen and the voice of the Bride now watch brother bam tells us amen amen Oh my he says I want to get here and as we're standing the musicians may come please how many love the word how many see the picture here amen questions and answers on Genesis he said I had a hot one that down there the other day talking about the women how she should wear long hair and I said a woman that bobbed her hair her husband had a right and the Bible and a Bible right to divorce her that's right what the Bible said that's exactly right holy ghost woman sitting there just the way that she had been taught that's all Loosely he said now if if they would cut it there's something wrong they had to cut their hair the Bible said let her take a razor and shave it all off and make her real her hair real slick until it comes out her head that's right that's what the scripture said and it says if she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband and a woman that's dishonorable has a legal right to be put away in divorce but Brothers hear this next one but he can't marry again now but he can put her away in divorcement see so so that's that it goes both ways amen you see when we speak on things like this amen amen this little group here is full of marriage and divorce problems amen but is this preaching is not being directed to nobody you got to understand that don't get into the carnal mind amen we're speaking about Christ and his bride how many know that the mystery of Christ and his bride is in marriage now if we can get that correct then you can get this correct and you can get the pastor and the church correct because that's also a mystery of Christ and his bride amen amen that's what the prophet said so there there's no reason you know to get kind of nervous about we believe the word am hallelujah amen and God will will do the work is that right amen but brother Ram says that's the scripture oh brother what we need is some question nights then he goes on and he says I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God Amen that's the scripture and every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors Christ right amen so that's why we have something and we're going to pray or or we're talking about the word amen amen we take off our hat right to honor Christ because he is our head and it says he says you that the the hair to the woman is her covering for that I'm reading the quote even all as if she was shaven that means she's going to cut her hair then shave it off brother R is reading First Corinthians 11 for if the woman be not covered let her also be Shor sh means shaven but if it be a shame for a woman if it's a shame for a woman to be shaven let her be covered now we're getting right down to the question he says it is wrong for a lady to cut her hair according to the Bible Now you listen right here and see if the Bible don't give a man a legal right to put away his wife see if it's right or not brother B saying scripturally this is correct for a man indeed ought to not cover his head have long hair for as so much as he is in the image and the glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man did you ever think of that and then brother B goes on and he brings it to the church see the woman's a type of the church if she cuts her hair that's the same thing happening with the church and this is Paul speaking and he said in Galatians 18 if a angel preach any other gospel already that you would you have already heard let him be a curse he says now don't blame me blame him and I say the same thing tonight today don't don't blame me BL blame the prophet for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is in the glory in the image of God but the woman is IM a glory in image of man for the man is not of the woman but the woman is of the man neither was the Man created for a woman but the woman was created for a man so right there brother bam tells us scripturally if she dishonors it if the church which is the woman dishonors Christ what what did he do to her he divorced her in other words I'm done with you but when he says shave your head he is telling her in symbol form amen amen you can do that because I'm not your head no more you can do that because I have divorced you you shave your head I have rejected you that's what he say amen right according to this and brother Bram sh tells us there's a religious perversion today brother bam pointed us and told us he said look at Jacqueline Kennedy Kennedy right she was a type brother she wasn't Jezebel in the whole picture she was just one woman but she was a type because brother bam said Ahab is Washington is Washington is that what he said ahab's Washington United States Jezebel is Rome the church but when jacken Kennedy Kenedy which was John Kennedy's wife John Kennedy had her hair cut amen he said look that CS an epidemic amen all the wom going to cut their hair have short hair like jacine Kennedy Jac Kennedy right she was a representation of Jezebel because in the Bible in the Bible when Jezebel married Ahab brother Bram said Ahab was the head amen but Jezebel was the
