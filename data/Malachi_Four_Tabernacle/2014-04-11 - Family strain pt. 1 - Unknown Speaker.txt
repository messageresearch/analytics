TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign controversial but you do have a choice in your humanistic realm but something inside of you is that Gene of God that you come predestinated from before the foundation you always had eternal life we don't receive eternal life amen yes we have eternal life because we are Sons because ye our son is God has sick foreign but that doesn't satisfy Son of God it is you know except the Creed of the church I say the apostles they were supposed to be baptized in waters the only thing that's satisfies Hallelujah and because she's something that I've sold something in our hearts there's already something there and potentially everything that we need for this life is already inside of us it has to be dermatized it has to be quick in other words that's something inside of you is to be brought out it has to be woke up realize that God always had a plan for your life but you see we we were born this body is come from yep my father and mother did make myself damn it so even that is all the potentials all of potentials that you need but it has to be quick and it has to be activated by the holy ghost power foreign that's why we read in Galatians 4 that we were already Sons but for that reason he sent it the spirit capital is the Lord Jesus Christ how many spirits of God how many Cummings of the spirit life foreign potato Hallelujah see so this is why Italian Church age he was talking about the baptism of the Holy ghosts he goes on to say upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost upon the sons upon the sun foreign that can happen tonight amen amen he says what is the baptism of the Holy ghosts it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ is the spirit of God coming in after you have repented having heard his word Hallelujah what we have look at the neighbors just set forth would be easier to understand if we all believe the doctrine of the Oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in the godhead but one okay thus we are not born again listen to this I said yes while the spirit of Life foreign foreign Australian church I'm open here so there's not the Covenant of the Holy Spirit didn't have to work to give us power yeah if that were true we are dishonoring the father I've not giving him a part in our complete salvation salvation for salvation is of the lord and there are three Lords salvation is of the Lord salvation I believe it's chapter two verse of the Lord and there's three Lords yes foreign the word he says listen must then then he the father must have something to do with it too because surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear yes it is is Jesus Jesus dwellers in them he he was dwelling with them and was going to be in there see right okay when he was speaking to the decide speaking to the disciples he said we will come here is the Father the Son of the Holy Ghost at one time that's right foreign says there are two coming of the spirit uals that the people don't know the real truth they simply believe in Jesus before I close this subject I know there is a question in your mind you will want to know if if I believe and the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation of trans Almas be careful here and see this it is not the Persona that comes predestinated the why then why do we try to act or say that president you understand again he says be careful here it's not the Persona that comes predestinated eternally from God it is or the sea yes that comes way back there ayatras too far back for the human mind to aggress the Eternal god with eternal thoughts Romans 9 13 Romans that neither was born there was a part of God became expressed in God brought Jacob back because Jacob alone was foreign amen but how come only take a machine and he saw us now but yet in the strain of the family I'm barely touching into this place what the strain of the family family well thank you Lord Timely you read the story in the Book of Genesis and you see Esau's character you see how he is Jacob was a shyster yes thank you amen amen a better man he said any device for their Church yep so what are you saying amen sad let's say Jacob be the one in here it's okay I'll leave come on because Esau was a better man okay bring me Vincent for his father amen amen take care of things come on amen amen and Jacob was just deceiving people all the time he wanted to see his own dad mama's boy um amen amen see Esau was so good of a person amen let his father say okay was ready to give him the Blessed seeds from God himself to pass that blessing on to eat something because he was a good man he deserved it and then Jacob comes and steals Hallelujah don't worry but now look let me say this here if you are a true sea you will hear the word the spirit the spiritual baptize you into the body of Christ and you will receive the words this is how clear the true evidence because when the word is revealed to you Jesus was the royal Seas when the spirit called to him the word manifested thoughts it was baptized in water upon obeying the words the Holy Spirit came upon him but the voice The Voice did not say this has become my son the voice said this is my son and I will dwell in here and all the way through he went in and demonstrated Powerade receiving the full revelation of God from God for that we have been constantly saved that the true evidence for the believer to receive the word foreign there's a way to receive it is amen amen Revelation Revelation is not intellectual information is an experience an experience when he quickens these this word that's in the Bible the promise for this real to you that's right man amen amen I mean it would start preaching them what's happening go ahead come on see now in the message paradox like this is he preached in 1963. I'm gonna read two quotes where he talks about family strength is Familia and in this one he talks about a young man very fine young man he was going with the little girl very fine little girl having a fine family because some kind of idea I walked away and he did something wrong and Manchester promised her to do a certain thing and do it and instead of him coming to the girl and apologize right felt like a real gentleman it just wasn't giving him to do it father and mother called me to the scene we would desire to know what is wrong with our boys it's not easy to do some time but we must be truthful and honestos the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he has been baptized and had his position among the Believers in church have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen he did it bad the thing about it is to take that family straight away and he just mentioned the academy what who bought this boy was right came to church he was a Believer remember somewhere on the other line yes listening we have not yet received the baptism of the holy of the Holy Spirit you thinking you have and having it with two different things you might be able to try to say you have it you might be able to show some evidence of some emotions inside of the area something something look at the controller yeah yeah no matter how many emotions you have you can jump up run Sensations something's got to control your life it's not you trying to control your life something's got to control yours granny Lord yeah if you have the Reigns of your life if you have the steering wheel of your lives yes see because if God verses amen the spirit raised Christ from the dead yes the spirit raised him from the day the Bible says the woman that lives in pleasure even the latest this is you've ever heard of terminology walking dead man that's biblical truth foreign so now this young fellow's parents his mother is no reflection on the journey in other words there is a stream that is they'll just sit down and you can talk to them they'll just stare you right in their face wow the girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister I've come down the street many many times in the morning and I would say to the young lady she would be sitting out in her yard fine morning isn't it you just stand and look at me you should come up to see us sometime and her brothers are that way too because her father and mother is the same way the father of the boys uh Mrs perado he says that's his whole family like that except one except out of that whole family have the whole family is someone that has converted this father and mother both are Christians filled with Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man yes the young man is about 17 18 years old mother's family do you think they've ever come there to church they know it's right there it's just not in there or ask for parts they just won't do it had a complex they will not apologize and that's where the boys stand yeah no matter how much you raise him up I love your family all of them drunken souls and so forth look at your family you know foreign so see you are a tree a part of that family tree but yet you have received the Holy ghosts that's the thing that made you change it's not your people anymore it's Christ man I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drugs now the same thing has happened to your son and after the father raised up and said yes my son went to the altario foreign to never marry a woman you'll make hell on Earth for her yeah sweet sweet Spirit forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in the Cristo internet then that will be a paradise to take the very nature of the boy that's been ready to him by his father and mothers intellectuals he is but he can't do it he'll never overcome Christ has to overcome David said it'll be a perfect paradox of the spirit of God I've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of the Holy ghosts and after a while God gets a hold of that same man and he stands right at the pulpit preaching the same thing that he wants him it's a paradox there's a strain in the natural family and those are things that genetically carry on foreign he says in the Next Generation worse that's right you may not want that because especially is familias yes the son let's say foreign foreign when I get my wife it's true and faithful to her because what happened he doesn't have the Holy ghosts runs in the family is here the thing that he hates amen all right that's right father father he's the he's my mom he used to beat her up I'll never do that strain in the family comes back around and you find the sun yes wow maybe the next Generation amen it's worse amen it's good diseases things you say oh I've had experiences with god brother that that don't exist no more I'm going to show you tonight amen spoken words The Original Seed see the thing is we have a way out we can break the family
