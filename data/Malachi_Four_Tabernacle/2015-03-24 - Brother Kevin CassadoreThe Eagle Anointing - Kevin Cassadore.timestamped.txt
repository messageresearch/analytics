[0:11] nobody home
[0:13] Lord Jesus cry
[0:19] that's what we come to worship and it
[0:22] all I got that's who we come to praise
[0:25] amen
[0:26] everyone's talking about and that's what
[0:28] we covered in here this morning
[0:29] yeah and once I'll be getting this not
[0:30] have to speak to an orange I got nervous
[0:33] I pray the voice of the Holy Spirit look
[0:35] at I was expected to speak to every
[0:38] heart this morning
[0:38] I had a thought process or that's the
[0:40] way I hate a man I'm never desiring
[0:42] Travis yeah I mean are Hungary that word
[0:45] of thought where's my radios I just
[0:49] wanted to give an out you after the
[0:54] service whatever it is but it is there
[0:58] these are all invited to the park here
[1:01] most positive thoughts I tell about it
[1:03] behind the church is it leaned only port
[1:06] and if I can't drive a car for a time of
[1:09] fellowship but I go Vanity's Montana by
[1:17] both kind of ethos and service to see
[1:22] you know so so recently at 5:30
[1:25] when I think we made the reason you give
[1:26] this announcement now that's what that
[1:28] allows a niche to just let the Holy
[1:33] Spirit have its liberties but I think I
[1:35] also do that now that it's videos up and
[1:36] after or goes forth his brother cares
[1:39] about it that we could remain in that
[1:42] very worship that most concise scripted
[1:44] lol and whatever the Lord is doing a
[1:47] bonus or cosas para server versus
[1:49] ratings to not interrupt that amen
[1:52] and I hope you guys yeah they're bad so
[1:56] we're glad to see the Lord move content
[2:00] those of it out it's not going to speak
[2:02] to us amen
[2:03] yeah one hand how many believe the Lord
[2:06] spoke to us last night
[2:07] well if there's a lot not you as a man a
[2:10] spiritual warfare together like a man
[2:14] prepare our heads for war if I want to
[2:17] modify together amen
[2:19] the weapons of our warfare I thought
[2:21] that'd be easier I'm not calling us all
[2:24] cosmetics their mighty involved as well
[2:26] it also send us to the pulling down of
[2:28] strong is that a man watching as their
[2:37] brother said already what a survivor not
[2:40] so much against demon but the battle
[2:52] within us we're in the valley of
[2:56] decision
[2:59] revenge said that's where the battle
[3:00] takes place you say all right case you
[3:02] say it's in the mind is there anything
[3:04] because that's where decisions are made
[3:07] okay that's enough this is yours is that
[3:09] right and the message letting off the
[3:12] pressure inside out that's your or the
[3:14] venom should I believe that pressure
[3:16] mind oppress atmosphere that we feeling
[3:18] it's not as if you look in this shower
[3:20] next hour
[3:21] not only at work not only at home that's
[3:25] what I got somebody said even in church
[3:26] when they gets here this is everywhere
[3:29] this pressure they stop our core values
[3:32] I want a man you feel that pressure we
[3:34] feel time getting bit shorter chores I
[3:37] don't sense it was a simple say I call
[3:38] it back out as months we feel time long
[3:40] time he said that pressure that we feel
[3:43] separate focus and each I believe the
[3:46] enemy no president
[3:48] pressing down a balanced person and look
[3:51] he says so that we can make the wrong
[3:53] decision toss another service have a
[3:55] Haman he says because when you're under
[3:58] pressure oh okay sure amen okay he
[4:01] said you say thing
[4:02] this is closer you do think I suppose I
[4:04] said you wouldn't do then audience if
[4:07] you take the time the one I said him to
[4:09] sit down and think of how they meditated
[4:12] the word that he made about it and put
[4:14] the word before us she says but under
[4:18] that pressure you make decisions so this
[4:21] is shows your same thing pieces closest
[4:23] that you normally wouldn't earn if I
[4:26] meant that no audience
[4:27] so that's let off the pressure dishes
[4:29] guess what I'm saying is I may have a
[4:31] man we have the victory they know
[4:33] whatever thought you to know our Lord
[4:36] Jesus Christ that must at least is our

[18:04] amen now as we look this morning I'm
[18:05] gonna stop me I want to preach to you
[18:07] this morning nobody guys next time I had
[18:09] my the help of the Holy Ghost about the
[18:11] Eagle age Aguila and we look in first
[18:14] Corinthians denouncing their iniquity
[18:15] and Paul is talking about wisdom he's
[18:19] comparing human with stomach with wisdom
[18:23] of God or some videos and Paul says
[18:26] finally said that the wisdom of this
[18:27] world is realistic mundo is foolishness
[18:30] yes he said that this to God are the
[18:31] alive but yet to the world own a mundo
[18:34] the power of God and whether the wisdom
[18:36] of God said you get it when they're
[18:37] preaching of the Cross is foolishness is
[18:40] a to the world I won't go to them
[18:42] who do not believe us can open it but
[18:44] unto us that believe Graham do you
[18:46] believe this show on to you we it is the
[18:49] power of God's and whether they be off
[18:51] to salvation I'm not sure how Allah says
[18:54] in verse 22 perform a message juice the
[18:57] Jews require a sign flughafen Senatus
[19:00] and the Greeks are looking for a little
[19:02] dispenser Judea but yet here we are at
[19:04] this time Richard Christ Jesus okay so
[19:06] he's stumbling block to the to be
[19:08] ironical nails and polish this to the
[19:10] Greeks and this I will be able but
[19:12] handle up to them that are called
[19:14] because whenever are going to get your
[19:16] call so not only do you believe or not
[19:19] because you know your recall to believe
[19:20] in citizen up against my company who are
[19:22] chosen to believe me or what are you
[19:25] left it for them to say he's a boy this
[19:27] is your purpose this is proposing in
[19:29] life and yeah you've got a reason for
[19:31] living I wasn't giving me there's a
[19:33] reason you were born as what can I say
[19:35] there's a reason God brought you in here
[19:36] does that there is a reason you're right
[19:38] here in this took place in this moment
[19:40] then when I see them I don't believe in
[19:41] coincidences like would say it's not
[19:43] really there's any coincidence or
[19:45] there's a divine purpose lead into your
[19:48] life well that's where you can find
[19:50] divine purpose as well as community and
[19:52] this is one of the things that the devil
[19:54] wants to rob you on the camera body
[19:56] wants to blind you think I see this is
[20:04] why I tried to impress you because he
[20:07] knows
[20:57] father of it
[21:48] phone equals n daughter of the Most High
[21:51] God
[21:51] there's no side pieces never has not
[21:53] only the children authority de semana if
[21:55] he tries to go press you only because
[21:57] he's afraid of you I didn't come on to
[22:01] come to the realization of the pink
[22:02] etcetera as opposed to me who you are
[22:05] who you are in Jesus Christ Jesus and
[22:08] it's a peaceful principle but the hell
[22:10] so we understand what if we're called if
[22:13] someone's had my shoulders in this book
[22:14] until the leave but I pay a half faith
[22:16] by the neck thing into the Jews of
[22:18] Greeks believe it may be foolishness
[22:20] that's had to what on other words but
[22:22] I'm going to the world I live up to the
[22:23] unconverted were like when we commit to
[22:26] the Ottoman unconverted Jews and Greeks
[22:28] lose equal men see it's foolishness
[22:30] he said how things look to you that are
[22:32] calls take a time I know I like how Paul
[22:34] uses that word because I'm gonna flip on
[22:35] you say to you that are calls everyone
[22:37] every because it shows this so much
[22:39] deeper what it's talking about for who
[22:40] didn't just believe it or just saying
[22:43] that you believe that's what the
[22:44] denominations do that so the copy wants
[22:47] to believe okay raise your hand okay
[22:49] there it is that's all it's polka but
[22:51] it's so much more than that
[22:52] Moscow they say you were called to this
[22:55] for this
[22:59] you are the child
[24:18] Jacob and Esau before internet was even
[24:22] born again I said before they even had
[24:24] an opportunity I arrived I say they
[24:26] don't wanna bother because God knew yeah
[24:28] just like he knows you he knows that we
[24:31] are called
[24:32] thank you so much about us now this is
[24:33] why is that I'm someone you can believe
[24:35] who's there for today and this is why
[24:37] Hixton is so when the world says its
[24:39] foolishness once again Gokula you say
[24:40] it's like they say Smita that's why they
[24:42] look at you okay sitting in a service
[24:45] like this we poked away stay with the
[24:47] liberty of the Holy Ghost jumpin
[25:00] the baby I don't understand why they you
[25:05] know may not like funny but yeah well

[27:13] livin it up
[27:13] I mean it'll get according to the world
[27:16] so whatever they're gonna join their
[27:17] inheritance with us what is it that's
[27:19] only temporaries don't justify what they
[27:21] have look again it can only last on this
[27:23] world wherever that able to be put your
[27:26] Treasury so far lead up somewhere
[27:30] it
[28:56] now it's foolishness to the world you
[28:59] look for that movable hey what God is
[29:01] doing in the word that we have with the
[29:04] devil's it's a power of love it's a
[29:05] quality of the wisdom of God he's heavy
[29:07] energies that are called authentic so
[29:09] how are in wisdom police have the we
[29:11] have to those two things so those kinds
[29:14] of comments giving us power and it's
[29:16] also giving us wisdom
[29:17] Olivia you know wisdoms are very
[29:19] important keys because a lot of people
[29:22] can have power in it other people can
[29:25] have an emotion even have a gift or they
[29:28] don't but wisdom Leah - no you said
[29:34] appropriate and said I mean according to
[29:37] God's words don't happen on it do and so
[29:38] wisdom I think I said these are very
[29:40] important parts about them about the
[29:42] Christian life he's gonna not knowledge
[29:44] but close even knowledge is different
[29:46] wisdom gets a Vidya knowledge means you
[29:49] know something basically comes out but
[29:51] just because you know it Koko's it
[29:53] doesn't necessarily mean you gotta do it
[29:55] for example or here you might know CPR
[29:59] has professor
[30:41] because they know it's their job
[31:29] reduce power it is with expertise Olivia
[31:33] to let that are called I took this one
[31:34] about and the floor is of God who is
[31:37] wise within them is my solid element and
[31:41] the the weakness of God honor you know
[31:44] they'd be that much worth it well you
[31:46] see your Colin was Tennessee elemental
[31:48] aren't you glad you see your caller who
[31:51] you are this I can see the vapor him
[31:53] cement to have a royal see the vapor
[31:56] hand I'll release me that around and now
[31:58] not many wise men you know much longer
[32:00] this habit it's not many mighty or noble
[32:04] men as long as quoted all social anomie
[32:05] aren't columns for their mothers but God
[32:07] chooses if it smoking a foolish things
[32:10] of this world we've got another
[32:11] correctamundo
[32:12] to confound the wise particle from their
[32:14] low time that's a striking statement
[32:15] that's what I do just not many mighty
[32:19] not many noble ones with no but how many
[32:21] wise men was one better side of our call
[32:23] for their mothers now Jesus all right
[32:25] guess who he also said I mean decent
[32:27] then he said thank you Father I guess by
[32:29] that you have hit these things yes of
[32:31] course I saw the wise and prudent I
[32:33] music-related so these men wise and
[32:35] mighty but also seaside but yet not calm
[32:38] dose when your mother Jesus said he
[32:40] desired prophesied of me who could put
[32:42] up opportunity and he said that with
[32:43] ears you can hear manage what you don't
[32:46] understand they would give it they
[32:47] didn't have another
[32:48] there was nothing within their mine I
[32:51] think they respond to the word by so
[32:54] they could hear it a little either but
[32:55] there was nothing to recharge yesterday
[32:58] I was put there there was no too deep
[32:59] that called out to the deep we look at
[33:01] clinical the enemy because unto them
[33:03] that are calling before models there's
[33:05] some neck and on the insanity monitor
[33:07] that is pulling you to the things of God
[33:09] and if there's a pull on the inside of
[33:12] you deep then there's gotta be a boat on
[33:15] the other side the other one I respond
[33:17] to that hunger if you're relying on
[33:19] vehicle Nina and to feel the void that
[33:21] your inner killing that was it also can
[33:23] take any so now that you are called
[33:25] on achates am I understand we're called
[33:26] picked from there how many mighty men so
[33:29] much God chooses the foolish things of
[33:31] the world overlooked what are they let
[33:33] me stop for a minute
[33:34] Poppa Ackerman you can take a look
[33:35] around today we're not away and people
[33:37] what they're doing with this message I
[33:38] think these are walking away from it
[33:40] it's not a user they're all intellectual
[33:42] line but they try to fix things and they
[33:48] sort of and they start walking away
[33:50] listen I in think deny the word the
[33:54] devil just takes them so far never fight
[33:56] you see we cannot understand the word
[33:59] well then have another human
[34:00] intellectual wisdom and if I don't mind
[34:03] there's only one way for family I have
[34:04] no Lord it dog that's in the revelation
[34:08] of the Holy Ghost as white dots unlike
[34:11] other men say that God would not reveal
[34:13] anything to John until
[34:16] I mean I know this here he's a key that
[35:09] Paul goes on the same day by the way he
[35:12] said we do not speak the wisdom of the
[35:14] world I don't so now they come up with
[35:15] wisdom of God you know so he reveals a
[35:18] man okay
[35:19] and we know that I is not seeing
[35:20] something else what my ears not hurt and
[35:23] it's not even in the heart of the man
[35:24] can see the person they don't believe
[35:25] all the things that's going on is
[35:27] prepared a witness not for a minute
[35:29] you know gee little sense and so these
[35:32] until his disciples she is equal one day
[35:34] he told them we're gonna think he said
[35:35] it is given unto you before sense out of
[35:37] it is given to you it's not just meant
[35:40] for you this finance know the kingdom of
[35:44] God
[36:55] we're call okay it was spent it was
[37:00] ordained for you who didn't understand
[37:02] it was meant for you to know the word I
[37:03] was gonna sign up without me now the
[37:05] Bible says it's gonna be so Jesus says
[37:07] yes will be say unto you it is given go
[37:09] says I don't know the Word of God does
[37:12] not give him I suppose everybody now
[37:14] Paul says in 1st Corinthians 9 the
[37:17] madman does what he says
[37:18] I has not seen in years let her know he
[37:21] not into the heart of man unless all the
[37:23] things not as prepared to know something
[37:25] about buddy now I've heard the
[37:27] denominational world on it we're gonna
[37:29] take this scripture just get out but

[37:32] fact look any less again say it's all
[37:34] hidden away that's what he knows
[37:37] understand but you cannot isolate the
[37:42] word they can say something up examine
[37:45] it doesn't say no Beeson you can't just
[37:47] take that one for every person is you
[37:48] gotta take the one next to it

[38:16] the spear when I speak I listen here
[38:41] we have something produces thirdly lying
[38:46] if a man quit and that is the power of
[38:50] God to salvation because the Holy Spirit
[38:54] will get is through sample has revealed

[39:49] the searches all things as we have for
[39:51] the fifty things of God over a fool in
[39:54] the day so we so we understand I
[39:57] thinking at them and we cannot hide and
[39:59] of course going there behind the verse

[40:08] that are along the Holy Spirit comes and
[40:22] makes it known to you yeah and you walk
[40:25] I mean a progressive revolution that's
[40:28] Oprah I see s God has so designed to
[40:31] tell you right now they may see my
[40:33] personal life personal estate said that
[40:35] God has a and has changed me on a very
[40:38] dangerous down there was revelation that
[40:41] God has brought to me along the years
[40:42] okay about that their assignments in
[40:44] this in the in the years I've been
[40:46] serving God's I'm talking about the
[40:48] twelve fourteen fifteen years I would
[40:50] serve of the man at once you can stay
[40:52] across they're gonna say no and God has
[40:53] brought me a long way doing that will
[40:54] come in as I get closer to human
[40:57] surrender more of my life to him in the
[41:00] bottle opens is worth to the igniters
[41:02] upon a bit deeper on a personal level I
[41:04] will put a handle like with your listen
[41:07] to a tape while you're reading the
[41:09] message you can read it the same one
[41:11] minute before the fifth time you catch
[41:17] the first time
[41:43] he did the proper God talk about
[41:52] at one time he thought the white horse
[41:53] rider
[42:38] revelation and it's all gonna see don't
[42:41] be afraid of it look at you know I used
[42:46] to hear folks make a statement I think
[42:48] they see that's crazy
[42:50] you know what all sprang about it I
[42:52] found this mongrel that for the past 20
[42:57] years since we didn't make that
[42:58] fifth-years
[42:59] cigarette night news that they have all
[43:01] popped the same thing to both Python
[43:03] Ruby and I've heard of sounding
[43:05] differential not sound alright so again
[43:07] then you take a look at the message and
[43:11] the messenger you know that wasn't the
[43:13] case for him not guaranteed he's our
[43:17] enemy leader and knows as much the
[43:20] prophet of God did the second one of
[43:21] course was a boy story he was the
[43:27] messenger man a man who was seated
[43:30] before the throne of God revelations one
[43:33] that what the Bible say will get rid of
[43:35] the seven spirits with his needs are
[43:37] before the throne that they've done
[43:38] which were the seven messengers table to
[43:40] the seven ages
[44:11] the design but look at the word so
[44:17] you've seen I said get off let's reveal
[44:19] them do not even have them unto us by
[44:22] the spirit what are you speaking
[44:24] you know brother Brennan says like I
[44:25] said I'd rather have the right spirit
[44:27] just because I don't like the doctrine
[44:30] don't demand to have the right pocket
[44:32] they had a wrong Janus people not
[44:34] because it goes to show you watch them
[44:36] and if you maintain the right attitude
[44:38] and a Google right and the right spirit
[44:40] before God God can reveal his wedding
[44:44] yeah but I'm going to show you more you
[44:47] can progress can grow it's gonna say you
[44:50] can picture it smell around for a long
[44:52] time to the other church has instilled
[44:55] the excess thank you to a condition
[44:57] there's no growth there's no spiritual
[45:00] development
[45:58] 20 plus years of us are walking away
[46:01] from it today saying that it's wrong
[46:11] in a message pew was never any spirits
[46:15] all thought that it was the most petite
[46:17] quiet
[46:17] there's only man-made ideas to say
[46:19] nothing hot in here the Lord has
[46:29] revealed them to us the the things of
[46:32] God reveals it to us in the know Nevada
[46:35] it's meant for you to know it okay so I
[46:37] said God will reveal it to you but we've
[46:40] got to maintain that out of jargon sake
[46:42] book that Spirit of God is kind of yours
[46:44] a man may never get to the point to
[46:47] react well that you know at all because
[46:49] if you get to a point yes cool you know
[46:51] it all kind of wants us both dead no it
[46:52] can't help meet yourself open to the
[46:56] Holy Ghost about that God can change
[46:58] your thinking around the bank can change
[47:00] your idea rises in a that you leave
[47:02] yourself open to leadership of the whole
[47:05] did he get develop you where they're
[47:07] going but sure you there might not be
[47:09] gotta build you up on a foundation of
[47:11] whether or not I mean no start to get
[47:16] too long but I want to say this courtesy
[47:18] that's that we're living in a greedy
[47:20] Jews and they're gonna write brother reg
[47:21] says he called it the Eagle leave anyone
[47:23] other than I get I don't want to read a
[47:25] quote to you Josephine I next article
[47:27] from the message the countdown clock
[47:29] without a receiver in 1962 it mean those
[47:32] in those I want you to notice here what
[47:34] brother Brent says he's a cutthroat is
[47:35] if he says all things in the natural the
[47:38] Pope and another line or a type of
[47:39] things in the spiritual people cause be
[47:41] all right we understand that it's not
[47:43] that they were he says I believed in
[47:44] evolution so better than that I will
[47:46] show but not the way scientist says it
[47:48] whatever I want is gonna be people's
[47:49] they've already defeated themselves on
[47:51] that hardness but the great Holy Spirit
[47:55] turn administered this I begin to move
[47:56] over the years
[47:58] and there come up one form of life is
[48:00] enough for one of you now then another
[48:01] form of my thought for Olivia and it
[48:03] kept coming up and some food maybe so
[48:05] again until it come up the very image of
[48:07] the one that was moving over it whatever
[48:10] name I think was a relation of man lay
[48:12] my head open which was a mature like
[48:14] this the image of God signed today when
[48:17] God was made flesh
[48:18] that's what so happened and he was a man
[48:20] and I don't it never produced anything
[48:21] else over what my boss it never produced
[48:24] any anything greater think I said Kent
[48:26] looking up way the very creator
[48:28] was a man himself nobody amen
[48:32] now this is why a lot said guilty let us
[48:35] make man in our own the image behind our
[48:39] own likeness ascending I didn't have
[48:41] dominion over the earth if I'm thrown
[48:42] together now the question is okay what
[48:44] is the image of them getting my videos
[48:46] Jesus answers that is you know what they
[48:48] say in the book of that knowledge on you
[48:49] know they want in Chapter three but you
[48:51] know that tells us that God is the
[48:52] spirit against its people and they their
[48:54] worship they just have us worship in
[48:56] spirit and in tripping on this video so
[48:58] that God is the spirit ascendance be a
[49:00] thought said that's make man in our
[49:01] image of God he created man spirits this
[49:06] is why in Genesis okay hang on a couple
[49:08] chapters later this way let's say it's
[49:11] out of the dust of the earth woman at
[49:12] the end of form antibody for what
[49:14] breathed into his nostrils and that he's
[49:16] a breath of life I believe he became a
[49:18] living soul it was a not living in the
[49:20] image and the likeness of God send me my
[49:23] watch however the REM says he said
[49:25] that's the evolution I believe in you
[49:27] gonna sound words when you open a lot of
[49:28] the great Holy Spirit what has people
[49:29] time I believe don't Graham that's the
[49:31] way the Holy Ghost does to us today
[49:33] instead what those boys were designed
[49:34] them what do you get a church is
[49:36] dedicated this by then he got to the
[49:38] leadership of the holy shrine that's
[49:40] because the Holy Ghost can come down and
[49:44] it can bring over the church vessel
[49:46] as a complication of the Gaucho and
[49:48] every son and daughter
[50:44] oh just come outside wait so long no
[50:48] bonus here Seki modern hat buddy
[50:52] snack we have today Papa's here blue a
[50:54] let's get the nmos soy another which was
[50:56] going on at the modern world looks on
[50:57] arcade will no more there the scientific
[50:59] age that we are living in destiny kind
[51:01] of webbing equals they're so advanced
[51:03] and why my files their soul that's in
[51:06] modern times so when I was a typical
[51:08] that they don't even have time to pray
[51:10] we're getting a devil but I'm pleased to
[51:11] say listen to the sermon on the sailboat
[51:13] I'm gonna step on it now we just can't
[51:15] do that the time you see it's just in
[51:20] our head we we don't have time I don't
[51:23] really do the world
[51:41] sacrifice yes
[51:53] so I'm now with member but Anna quite a
[51:55] bit I like how he says this looks like
[51:56] one of these modern happenings that's
[51:59] what they seem at those well there is a
[52:00] forerunner of spiritual happening
[52:02] mystical totally looks like this even
[52:04] goes to speak like this now remember me
[52:05] but modern happenings are forerunners of
[52:08] spiritual - it does - on a second
[52:11] signals of a points the natural as the
[52:13] spiritual until I'll just be part each
[52:15] one accompanies each other goats I
[52:17] provided over and they only improve over
[52:20] the other so I don't know what I know
[52:22] one was already local I'm reading
[52:23] directly from the countdown over the
[52:27] others I think that happens in the
[52:30] natural course I do not learn the next
[52:33] thing that happens Jessica said it will
[52:36] be an improvement said oh never again
[52:38] look what's down there this is why it
[52:40] doesn't make sense it's a deal for
[52:42] example for Hitler look at the modern
[52:44] world we live today can we learn about
[52:46] the people soil we have we have
[52:49] technology they don't care about here
[52:51] we've got we've got cell phone there's
[52:53] no civilized and now when you compare
[52:54] the cell phones up today's episode is it
[52:57] always south homes of ten years ago
[52:59] that's an aside there is an improvement
[53:01] they've got smaller and watch the game
[53:04] gotten smarter mother baby hey is that
[53:07] right they can do a whole lot more than
[53:09] they used to do ten years ago
[53:11] I never remember where they work where
[53:13] they first came out you couldn't make a
[53:14] phone call that was it but I said once
[53:16] when I probably spoke and then the next
[53:18] version you could send a text message
[53:20] there's a window and then the base
[53:22] version it came out and cover and then
[53:26] just begin to improve so now not only
[53:31] can it call but wait am I mmm Senate
[53:34] Xmas in gentle fixable
[53:35] it can browse the Internet man it can't
[53:38] tell you where to go without me it's got
[53:41] all kinds of devices so the same in the
[53:47] natural that what happens one time if I
[53:50] said money is one that comes in the
[53:52] beginning this is what I mean now notice
[53:54] how he said discipline what he said that
[53:55] natural guess what I'm glad it's a type
[53:57] of the spirit actually by just reading
[54:00] so take for instance
[54:03] transportation that's what I feel
[54:05] he said at one day Julio there was a
[54:08] horse and buggy car you got an ax but
[54:10] now we've got inaudible the other one up
[54:12] a movie and it still has horsepower no
[54:14] Didache puts on a grinder but it was an
[54:17] advantage over the horse and cart back
[54:19] that's what I'm talking about it and the
[54:21] roll and we used to ride a horse of buzz
[54:24] on this economist and I basically took
[54:26] the article deal but the most about the
[54:28] movie and after the automobile was have
[54:30] a movie the Wright brothers the funders
[54:32] right came along and made in their place
[54:34] an IV or steel horsepower of course I
[54:36] got my incident improvements you could
[54:39] do more save my soul faster
[54:41] the old further than right left near the
[54:43] horse could get it back on you follow me
[54:45] Hosea now watch what he said so he says
[54:47] now listen coach coach again when
[54:49] anything happens on the earth I guess it
[54:52] was a together it is a warning there's
[54:54] my VIP it's a was something is fixing to
[54:56] happen is that it is here watch this now

[55:09] his achievements ooh logos is something
[55:12] that God is fixing to do to his shirt
[55:38] look he said his head
[55:41] we came from a horse and buggy do it to
[55:44] an automobile come over to the airplane
[55:46] oh now the church are you gone has been
[55:49] enabled the spiritual line and I mean
[55:51] that's mean to achieve I don't have
[55:53] justification sanctification through
[55:57] West Linux on Thursday bus baptism the
[55:59] Holy Ghost now he's working on top and
[56:01] it is a shadow and a tight there are so
[56:03] many people of the achievement you know
[56:05] what God has been able to do so come on
[56:07] I'll remember they're quite a bit god
[56:09] you're fine
[56:10] with the Holy Spirit power good with it
[56:13] he was able to achieve by Luther her
[56:15] brother dedication have shown and when
[56:17] the church got justify whether was how
[56:19] they intend to get like this on I was
[56:21] getting him to lose some amazing through
[56:23] justification God was able to do it
[56:26] depressed his achievement is going to
[56:29] hit one man I'm gonna stand still long
[56:32] term impact on to the people when I
[56:41] think all right we're going down the
[56:43] next on us again
[56:44] God's achievement nobody was able to get
[56:50] away from the and preach sanctification
[56:55] something as you attend the church so
[56:57] they guess come from the horse so they
[56:59] come another article being off the movie
[57:00] now we've got more live but there was
[57:03] money and I had started running the
[57:06] church do in Azusa Street the ground
[57:18] are you following him
[57:30] the church took the church they wanna
[57:46] guess from an earth boundary nuclear
[57:49] deterrent to a soul in the old days
[57:55] people handbook just like the airplane I
[57:57] think it's what I do
[57:58] and the Holy Ghost came behind it you
[58:01] know as I say before design you see
[58:02] justification it's the horse it was say
[58:04] my education was the honorable thing I
[58:06] was letting out in and I'll begin to
[58:08] move along there's no man the baptism of
[58:10] the Holy Ghost is this where you took
[58:12] off the ground you got your feet off the
[58:14] ground before get up in the air now
[58:17] around in the head
[58:19] oh thank you man then people are like
[59:06] anything they got the feet off the
[59:08] ground so I found that God was able to
[59:10] bring his church of would answer yes and
[59:13] his achievement Radel when he got a
[59:15] bunch of people to look at the hand
[59:17] because stand still long ago so he's
[59:19] getting more the Holy Spirit in it for
[59:22] the sign now notice the same horsepower
[59:24] is enough what psychologists that can
[59:26] also horse did the same thing to
[59:30] inaudible about the movie and then to
[59:32] the airplane go whatever and that look
[59:34] what he says here okay the same Holy
[59:36] Spirit do a biga cycle that brought
[59:38] justification to the church I think I
[59:41] said it brought more of it somehow I say
[59:43] you want it brought sent to the king
[59:44] what's happening I said he poured it in
[59:46] with the Holy Ghost look whatever design
[59:49] until the same power with it with it
[59:51] right but but the same thing ready
[59:54] Michael
[59:55] then it took the church off of its feet
[59:58] but I said that this guess up into the
[1:00:00] heavens is better now things has changed
[1:00:03] all together because some Ian's is
[1:00:08] moving on that's insanity
[1:00:10] and we're always talking about science
[1:00:13] is how it's moving but let's look back
[1:00:17] and see what our great scientific
[1:00:21] teachers are doing here and we'll look
[1:00:24] at what God is doing with his church
[1:00:29] now we enter pH on the phone that I know
[1:00:32] Lord horses on our side
[1:00:33] no Lord automobile about the movie to
[1:00:36] tell the Lord airplane but my cell units
[1:00:39] now oh they're astronauts they don't
[1:00:44] astronaut that's right there's many
[1:00:46] seeds these space be all the heavenlies
[1:00:49] have these up in the space it's possibly
[1:00:52] says old lines about this is astronaut
[1:00:55] age what a race thing you gotta go now
[1:01:02] we're an astronaut and so has the church
[1:01:07] and everything that is the big sweep big
[1:01:10] honor that I can't get before the people
[1:01:12] and they have settled down for an
[1:01:15] airplane
[1:02:14] dude now the property god when he was
[1:02:17] here but that's my sake
[1:02:19] said this is something I have trouble
[1:02:21] getting across to the people who I
[1:02:24] didn't get because they settled for an
[1:02:26] airplane they don't know know what off
[1:02:29] this is an ashtray have settled down
[1:02:36] satisfy my seal this Center can't be
[1:02:38] nothing more without an airplane you do
[1:02:41] look good not knowing I'll tell you
[1:02:44] though that we've got something green I
[1:02:46] don't guess Oh Oh be ready I don't want
[1:02:50] to never settle
[1:02:51] I'm gonna go for just being identify all
[1:02:54] that God's promise critical
[1:02:59] oh brother sister you are balanced I
[1:03:00] don't want to shame God okay let's have
[1:03:03] it
[1:03:03] I want to receive all that has given to
[1:03:06] us already
[1:03:07] especially in the Shashtri on a pretty
[1:03:11] simple I want to settle for anything
[1:03:12] else then I'm like oh so what God's Word
[1:03:15] is fresh and only were my friends
[1:03:18] Coquina he says but you see Superman but
[1:03:21] you can't understand buddy today but not
[1:03:23] let's amend do something no matter
[1:03:25] school it is to show the church
[1:03:27] confidence that he God is doing
[1:03:30] something that's how see they're always
[1:03:32] trying to bring the old thing back he's
[1:03:33] looking a little mirror this is the
[1:03:35] church now I think I said I'll check the
[1:03:37] old things
[1:03:37] yeah his history as he's thrown yet it
[1:03:47] was all right if I'm up yeah and it's me
[1:03:49] as with the epicenter yeah it was all
[1:03:52] right on his date without
[1:03:54] amen shake hands with the preacher Lazar
[1:03:56] a long time ago
[1:03:57] I see people talking but that's passed
[1:04:00] now goes off boss hell yeah the
[1:04:02] nomination has lived out at stage notice
[1:04:03] we never yields with your pack step now
[1:04:05] focus also yeah we're in the astronaut
[1:04:08] amen he says I begin a federal interest
[1:04:11] in the debate has what stopped the
[1:04:14] people all turned around and hit the
[1:04:16] door I would counter they don't know
[1:04:17] what to think about these things inside
[1:04:19] of us they don't know how to get it cuz
[1:04:21] I'm gonna see them this astronaut is the
[1:04:25] spirit because they didn't put blinders
[1:04:54] on see certain things just to show us
[1:05:03] beyond this you're positive it has the
[1:05:11] Holy Spirit searches out all things and
[1:05:14] the big things have governor for
[1:05:16] Millennials oh praise the Lord
[1:05:19] Yeti's tells us no decent inste same
[1:05:22] spirit we was beaten it is the same
[1:05:24] power to a woman it's not something new
[1:05:26] have a look it's not something different
[1:05:28] it's the same power well they have seen
[1:05:30] the spirit
[1:05:46] so what's this guy that's the extra now
[1:05:52] eighth man so if that is in the natural
[1:05:55] just elicited the spirit tested on
[1:05:57] Johnson sounds to be thought back to the
[1:05:59] church went from an airplane shut up
[1:06:01] he's not getting somebody a viola and it
[1:06:03] has taken a higher flight know what I
[1:06:16] and that's the way God is doing it now
[1:06:17] but you don't want our instead of
[1:06:19] bringing out some little school guy talk
[1:06:22] about a certain creep that was happy two
[1:06:24] years ago he said he says God is proof
[1:06:39] robot people are talking about being
[1:06:42] modern and then I realize I may call
[1:06:43] that modern and when some of animal this
[1:06:45] is modern isn't what he said this is
[1:06:51] modern system is is modern according to
[1:06:54] the kingdom of God knows what everybody
[1:07:03] really Eagles and eagles not heard of
[1:07:05] members no they're not
[1:07:11] we need to sword in the heavenly guest
[1:07:13] center that I will say is that all about
[1:07:15] an amen God's prophet rising on the
[1:07:18] scene well don't say it i sell--
[1:07:19] thankful we are for that all right so
[1:07:21] some would eat what is it his spiritual
[1:07:24] manifestations or historicity by this Oh
[1:07:26] spiritual word if I obviously thought
[1:07:29] incoming literally full filled before us
[1:07:33] now watch this yeah he said the Prophet
[1:07:36] on the ages more than that what it was a
[1:07:38] spiritual manifestation when my son is a
[1:07:41] part of the spiritual work people are
[1:07:43] becoming full feel before us literally
[1:07:46] literally fulfilled before at the
[1:07:48] Saturday okay I'm gonna with which
[1:07:50] is a revealing of Jesus Christ and in a
[1:07:52] database because Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:54] word horizon but actually that word
[1:07:56] reveal is you see it's revealing Jesus
[1:07:58] Christ I know salvation of the church oh
[1:08:00] yeah and now that word that's how I got
[1:08:02] a spirit it's me it takes that word but
[1:08:05] once I find out we read in the Bible
[1:08:06] searches all things it makes that word
[1:08:11] known to man appeals to them - it's an
[1:08:14] unveiling today it's an unveiling of
[1:08:16] Jesus and ladies he's reveals more of
[1:08:18] his work because that is the foundation
[1:08:21] upon which the church is built
[1:08:40] there's not another
[1:09:22] yeah
[1:10:39] there's a quote I wish I had it with me
[1:10:41] now
[1:10:43] Becky we're brother man talks about
[1:10:45] Romanticism they find these and he said
[1:10:48] there is too much truth okay we're not
[1:10:50] in this message to get caught up in
[1:10:52] finances there's too much truth yeah
[1:10:56] God's word has been revealed to you and
[1:11:00] I said what about Haiti to start
[1:11:02] isolating things I'm going to get caught
[1:11:04] up in the finances peace I want to just
[1:11:06] take off it is yeah
[1:11:08] the Holy Spirit in my life piccola
[1:11:10] suppose it's looking to be done quick in
[1:11:11] this word and it'll bring forth life of
[1:11:14] its own yes the action on age is Robert
[1:11:18] brother that says work should the church
[1:11:19] be inside I guess we should be lifted up
[1:11:22] guys way above everything which one's
[1:11:25] Hannibal that's right whatever the
[1:11:27] spiritual astronaut is Eagles that's not
[1:11:31] that's my thoughts on ideas hey man give
[1:11:33] me that president says the spiritual
[1:11:41] astronaut he said my penis about that is
[1:11:44] high schools he goes beyond all
[1:11:47] denominational creeds
[1:11:49] mechanic what get building mr. Knight
[1:11:51] and barriers by this I'll be on
[1:11:54] denominational think you owe beyond the
[1:11:58] cloudy thoughts
[1:11:59] Rose any and he looks up above the Stars
[1:12:04] the astronaut believer again if that's
[1:12:08] what now is also up in the heavenlies is
[1:12:11] far beyond their earthbound things have
[1:12:14] a nice way up high 39
[1:12:16] he's an outer space it's possible see
[1:12:18] the earthly man I don't know kind of
[1:12:20] that doesn't know very much about outer
[1:12:21] space astronauts or not is in outer
[1:12:26] space as possible he's there with the
[1:12:28] disabled native and that's the reason so
[1:12:30] I met the church to me it's all wait
[1:12:32] they don't understand because
[1:12:37] that same scripture of first Corinthians
[1:12:40] in the Dominican chapter to happy little
[1:12:43] goes in first number 11 there's a little
[1:12:45] bit all the time which is where we left
[1:12:47] office with all those guys it says for
[1:12:49] what a man knows that's the things of a
[1:12:51] man save the spirit of a man which is in
[1:12:54] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[1:12:58] man but the Spirit of God

[1:13:21] syllabus videos first 12 now we have
[1:13:23] received not the spirit of the sport of
[1:13:26] the world but the Spirit which is of God
[1:13:29] that we might know the things that are
[1:13:33] freely given to us of God you know total

[1:13:54] verse 13 reso testing which things also
[1:13:57] we speak not in the words which man's
[1:14:00] wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:14:02] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:14:05] spiritual with no comparison Ana's
[1:14:09] course alumina silicon a skin Cena and a
[1:14:12] spirit one gonna speak to an honest
[1:14:14] return now watch here verse 14 it is
[1:14:18] equal to opposite but the natural
[1:14:20] receives not the things of the Spirit of
[1:14:22] God for they are foolishness unto Him
[1:14:24] neither can he know them because they
[1:14:27] are spiritually discerned pero en todas
