TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello is is amen amen and after he had prophesied the first time this was look at this one mistake it brought back a lot of things put skin back on the doctor yes he was like daniel daniel born in captivity in babylon in babylonia daniel daniel yes yes take the little book which is open in the head of the angel was standing upon the sea and upon the earth amen i mean so to bring authority out and put his foot amen spiritually speaking over the sea sorel over the land the amen i mean but the holy spirit during this people's hand speaks to child and tells them go to that message take the little boy and one is still sealed you know wow the order should say that no signal says the little book is open at the end of the and i went up to the angel and he said unto me it's only for me it sounds ridiculous that's the interpretation that message people give it that's good it's good brother it sounds ridiculous but that's the interpretation message people give it give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be not now sweet and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bigger um these promises of god thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues there's a second prophecy he only recited the same thing over again but this time it was for a purpose it was directed on a certain thing is why because around the second prophecy was not to the dry bones anymore the second prophecy was to the message they don't who are in this state yes sir what did that mean okay christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth in many places he was the first fruits of them that swept everybody in the bride coming of christ hallelujah for a resurrection has he will hallelujah hallelujah ezekiel 37 oh yes in 63. and then there was a shaking hallelujah political disturbing disturbing in a religious we're in the of israel the israel in the natural but paul said that the church of jesus christ of spiritual israel yes of god says whatever god does or will do regulators with the jews he does with his bride you understand is why is ezekiel 37 there because before armageddon before the millennium millennium there has to be a complete restoration amen is do they have a nation in an army hallelujah is god didn't restore them back to israel to have political the revival moses elijah's going to tear that thing down hallelujah come on you need the holy ghost yes you that's good brother amen it's good he's going to use is is that right how is he going to do it to them by the spirit of moses elijah and christ remember the revelation of jesus christ brother branham says sister stranger they said elijah in christ what i have heard because how can the spirit of moses elijah and christ minister amen the children moses to calm down and anoint you here his servants elijah coming off of the mountain and the different ones remember we preached eliminated enlighten the earth is that right i mean and he cried with a loud voice come out of her mind because when have their names written on the labs book of life revelation chapter 7 amen amen says that he calls him he sets him same thing does he call you out yeah come out of her my people i want you to understand this brother he did not call everybody out he said come foreign in is god whereas people yes sir you see them in revelations amen brother these jews how is what happens then see when jesus cried lazarus when he cried great big ones too enormous and they take their own graves yes is that what we read right there 37 once the breath came in them what happened what happened they stood on their feet a mighty marching hallelujah this is where the he says all other books those who libros it's not like this book no other book amen about that's what message churches have become it's true brother it's so true but this word has a prophecy that i'm not just you know trying to preach a sermon i'm trying to get you to see what it is there's something taking foreign the bible is a living foretold witness of jesus he says it's the complete body of jesus christ and in christ every foreign and that's that's not the spirit of the bible i go is hallelujah he lost his is say and i'm going to say let this mountain here be moved over there that's the stream over there for he had complete supreme control he was a minor hallelujah original owner he said we're going to find it just in a minute he sits on the throne up with it in his hand oh that makes me feel religious to eternal life it gives you come on hey man that's don't you see the words of jesus christ of the living god listen to me and she will rise to her feet like the mighty marching army what are we reading is foreign in the name of jesus a mighty marching army hello chapter one is this can't happen oh this is too much right the revelation of jesus christ when the true church is the true revelation of you know what that four amen foreign oh oh she's covering her feet with two weeks oh and they gave the mystery stadium they gave the anointing and brother brown during that week he was anointed by four winds he said it's the most that's the prophecy today okay it's for the church is hallelujah let's go m and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourished ministry and knit together increases with the increase of god they can't even do the first part and that's that the bone has to connect with the bones amen amen do you understand what that means we have to find a place we can be in true connections it's time to get off the sidelines amen i don't like that fear i don't like it because we got an assertion in the word of god yes amen amen when you give way to that spirit yes sir all right little fanaticism just sit still and do nothing a man that's going to do something it's told about because thank you life was not spoken to do something for christ soldiers ready for any work you may not weigh 105 pounds but whether you can be full of power if you just let god have his way come on amen amen that was in the message redemption by powell and the message then jesus came but that's yes sir oh he was right there what about being they're doing something anyhow so what are they doing i'd rather be found making a mistake then crying amen brother this is that out amen come in it's hard is it easy for a bone or a whistle to connect with another bone this is good hey all right wow that'd be a pretty short one huh you see what i'm talking about holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment minister and knit together increases with the increase of god no you know haciendo what the word says has a purpose she's coming from the north south the east and the west this is not this is not working out amen hey man come on it's brother here he is not his place he wants that place that's right that's right i mean the gift of wish the better man i'm saying by exactly yes sir yes and that is needed in the south that's what the nourishment does is god structured the body
