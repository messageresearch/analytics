TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now the Church of the firstborn in the Ephesians and for a subtitle or whatever you want to call it context like brother would do many times amen title he said my title is leadership and my subject is follow me Hallelujah that what he said hallelujah amen and we are Hallelujah so I believe uh there's something there's there's a something defined to what God gives and I believe that help helps us more to Define what we're speaking of when we give a subject amen or when we give a title something and the reason for that is because right here in Hebrews it speaks of a church of the firstborn Now who is the first born amen was there a firstborn son the first born Jesus Christ he was the first begotten of the father is that right and the first the Paul speaks of it two ways the first begotten of the father Father which was speaking of his birth and then you find him speaking of the first begotten amongst the dead you can even read Ephesians 5 in many scriptures even in Corinthians where he quotes quotes the scripture where God says Amen in the Psalms this day have I begotten thee amen and he's talking about his resurrection so he's showing you that not only is he the first begot or the first born amen as to say In the Flesh amen amen but the first to raise from among the dead amen you understand yes amen now there was a church of the firstborn in the early church amen amen our subject is a desire or our desire to maintain the father's name and obtain The Inheritance amen amen we we've already seen how they came into the land how they came into the Ephesians remember that establishment and all of that that made them the Church of the firstborn they were the ones that were carrying the name of Jesus Christ brother mam said in them that name lived and people today if you get too in ual and too caral about the Revelation that God has given us in this hour all you can think of when it comes to the name living in the church would just be that we have now the name of Jesus Christ when we baptize in that name and I'm not making light of it that's a great Revelation but that was something that even the Pentecostal Church received is that right but and then brother mam goes on to tell us there was Jesus only and there was this and there was that amen and then the true Revelation comes out how many knows brother bam said that even that was one of the revelations of the seals amen what he said amen the baptism in the name the Lord Jesus Christ yes he yes that's what he said he said serpent seed was one of the revelations of the seals and he preached that in 58 and then and then and then in 1965 he remember when we preached on the exposition book how many remembers defending the exposition book Hallelujah is what we titled it we preach the whole Sunday on Amen because of what was going on but remember we brought out brother said in 65 the lord gave me a a revelation yesterday just the other day about the serpent seed then I want to add it in that book so in that Exposition book in the Blue Book amen amen there's things that brother bradam was receiving from God even as late as 1965 and he was including those revelations in that book and you see what he's talking about when you read the Ephesian Church age something that had not said in 58 but he said in the exposition hallelujah amen amen yes sir and what was that one of those things was if you remember he took us back to the scripture God made uh male and female and blessed him and called their name what name he said the early church only had one name before they were the church age of eph they were the manifestation of the name of Jesus Christ yes sir they were called Christian amen amen amen They Carried his name they weren't Ephesians they weren't this they weren't that they were the Church of Jesus Christ amen amen but then when the denomination ages began see it was after the departure but now look I want to get into all that I just say that to say this when we look at what God really restored that Revelation for us amen was not just to know water baptism and how to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is all that it is is that the only thing that this message came to reveal to us about the name I'm talking about the name no it wouldn't have not been necessary for it to be revealed one of the revelations of the Hidden Mysteries hello if it wasn't something greater than what they had back there amen yes sir because Jesus said I came in the name of my father is that right and what did he say what did he say in St John 17 when he's praying he said Lord I have manifested by name there much difference much difference between manifesting the name and just having the name or saying the name and saying I have the name and I baptize in the name and manifesting the name it's something different amen Jesus said I come to manifest the name and I got that scripture written down for further reference over here but to show you that this Revelation in this hour amen that come under the seals was to bring the name back to the church brother said the world is filled with Blasphemous name are you Christian no I'm Methodist are you Christian I'm Baptist I'm I'm this I'm that now we have to make these things really clear because you cannot say that there is not a church carnal and a church spiritual in this message the church caral and the church spiritual are in the message amen amen and the church carinal can take these things and apply it in a carnal mentality Amen in such a way in such a way that they'll even tell people don't name your church because it's a Blasphemous name tell me where brother bam said that amen amen then the Bram Tabernacle is a Blasphemous name too but no it was stayed and it it it was established that way just for the reference of the place that we gather amen amen but we are representing and we are to manifest a name on the earth amen amen and if the only thing that we're manifesting is the name of the church that we have not accomplished what the message come to do in us right amen amen we're just another church member like somewhere else the only way you can manifest the name is that you got to be first born in the family yes hallelujah amen when you were born in your family did you ask can I join the Hernandez Family can I join the Lopez family can I join the the the the Gomez family did you ask you were born Hallelujah and because of birth that name Hallelujah was represented in you is that right amen but then that doesn't settle it amen amen then you have to come forth and grow and mature and manifest that name to show I'm a chip off the old block I'm a chip off the old block amen am I'm of the same pedigree amen amen I'm same lineage amen has somebody ever told you you look in the natural you look like your father right you look like your father why because God is known by his characteristics and God's characteristics are superatural so in you you have certain characteristics you have certain features that resemble your father Hallelujah that's by birth his blood is in you amen and you were in your father and in your great grandfather the Bible taught us that when it spoke of Levi same ties in the Lo of Abraham to prove predestination Hallelujah is that right and Not only was Levi in there but so was Judah and Joseph and all the rest of them amen hallu but Levi was count to pay TI but now notice this here the scripture we read the church of the first born of the first born we're going to make it singular because that's the way it reads and that's you're going to see right now amen the Church of the first born who is the first born there was only one to start with is that right amen and then all the other ones that come off of that one were first born first first showing that they have to be born the same way how was Jesus born by the word and when the word was planted then the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost came and gave birth to that child and that's how every child was supposed to be born according to that birth Jesus said he must be born again Hallelujah and notice what the scripture says the Church of the first born which are written in heaven amen notice by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it proves what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the earnest to your inheritance Ephesians 2 is that right Ephesians 1 is that right amen and Ephesians 4:30 the seal until the day of your Redemption is the earnest of your inheritance so it shows that if you are born by the holy ghost that you have your name written in heaven before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah it wasn't put on there when you accepted the Lord it wasn't put on there when you receive the Holy Spirit but when you receive the Holy Spirit and you were born into the family Prov amen you can say all you want am you can claim all you want you can prove all you want but until you're born into the family there is no solid evidence that your name is written in heaven Hallelujah and the reason that you receive the holy spirit says Galatians 4 because you are Sons God has sent the spirit of his son to fill you so that you can cry AB father you were already a son and because you were a son he sent the Holy Spirit to do what what is it for people in the message don't believe in a in a in a in a experience the Holy Ghost get that come on when the Bible it openly and the message of the hour teaches it from 47 65 even invisible union he said that's the only kind that the word can produce he said in 1965 he said go in the scripture and find where they shook hands the scure said I'll join the message church and I'll believe what the preacher says and I believe what I read in the books yes I'm saying that even if you believe what's in the books have you received the Holy Ghost since hallelujah hallelujah said Paul would be certainly in disagreement with you that's what he said Hallelujah told Paul brother Paul I just believe it not good enough brother bam said that's all you can do but God has to accept your faith right and how does he AC your Fai he gives you the Seal of circumcision he's telling you I have accepted your faith in me I'm giving you a sign Hallelujah I'm cutting off the shpl rest sirj yes sir subject you subject you by the same spirit that raised Christ from Qui your mortal body hallelujah hallelujah so now here's the true church in Hebrews 12 in the establishment you believe that was the Ephesians that were establishing as we have previously seen placing of the church where were they where were they Heavenly Jerusalem wow where were they Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what's the believer's position his position in Christ is his Heavenly position what he is that right am hallelujah what he made you Christ before the foundation of the world it's your rightful position and that's why just like in the Old Testament Joshua the soldiers amen I'm saying this you know so that we can all understand when they ran when they crossed Jordan amen amen what do they begin to do fight right they begin to fight and their fighting was for what to move out the enemy that was in their land because that land was rightfully theirs it was already prophesied it was already written and numbers that that L was theirs Hallelujah and they were the lineage they were the L descendants from Adam brother they knew they were pedigree they could look through the five books of Moses and say I come from here all the way here hallelujah because Redemption parts and God sentes with two signs first and second pool but Joshua brought the people in with the third pool Hallelujah that's why people in this day see get all kinds of mixture in it because when you just bear down on one type amen amen types you have to know when to begin a type when to stop the type amen amen and how to apply it is that right what if you say the type of Abraham amen remember brotheris sanctification you separating himself and and then the P Fire coming down and the sacrifice the blood sacrifice then he met Hallelujah that's pcal power is that right then who he met God in flesh is that right A Sign amen amen is that right am and then what happened the type continues right all that speaking of us the type continue yeses you shall receive a promised son I shall return they receive the son Ti from receiving Jesus Christ in the air is that right amen but then if you're if you're in that line of thought that's where the type ends you say how come okay let's continue it then because after did did Abraham receive his body change to receive the promised son yes sir so after his body change he lied he backslid you got to know where to stop that's good brother amen you understand what I'm saying if you're if you're seeing a type I don't know this is the type this is where it fits amen amen and then it goes on another type not Mariah We preached on that you see how that typed out how that me how that's brought to our day the whole Bible is full of that Hallelujah there's not one thing you can't bring out of this that is not relevant and and applies to our Day Bible is a new Bible what he say hallelujah but the thing about types you got to run them time you'll be lying after your body change oh my oh wow amenah no oh where where is this at the church of the first born they were set in Heavenly places so when they come into the land they're pushing out the enemy because that land is rightfully theirs amen now look oh my why do I do this they they knew their names were WR were in the book did they know that then we read that right there Hebrews 12 Church of the firstborn names written in heaven what did Jesus tell him in Matthew 10 don't Rejoice because the demons are subject unto you right amen they were rejoicing screaming shout but Rejoice names are written in heaven brother said J was right among them is that right yes so now notice these of the Church of the first board were their names in the book were they were their names in the book yes sir their names are written in heaven they know their predestination by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that what Paul was teaching to the Ephesians that's what he was teaching is that what brother taught us is that what he taught us did he teach us eternal security he said yes but only in the Holy Ghost is that right amen he said Baptist say CH Security One save always save and pain the city red because you're saved anyway you want brother said that shows you haven't got what you're saying that's right that's right amen amen he said CU you really had it you wouldn't want to do those things that he's gone amen the earnest of our inheritage they were born in the family placed in the body were they set in Heavenly places yes abely that's the Church of the firstborn why am I why am I laying this out notice where where notice where Perfection is I wrote that there because Hebrews 12 says the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the bodies the Flesh of just men no what does it say where is perfection said your flesh no no come on now Hebrews 12:23 the last part of that verse and to the spirits of just men made perfect where is perfection lay not in the flesh friend hello where's Perfection the spirits of of just men made perfect stinking nature to your body change sir that's right amen yeah you will not perfect this body because full Redemption and full adoption change the body is that the change of your body that's right amen amen M right here Revelations 5 speaking of the earnest of our inheritance he says full adoption but we now have the earnest we receive the holy spirit is our complete adoption or complete salvation he says oh I just love that we are waiting for the fullness of adoption and this takes place place when at the first resurrection when our bodies will be changed and these vile creatures that we are have a body thank you Lord so that's why coming into the promised land of Canaan means two things first spiritual establishment and then what is this Third Exodus leaving what this Earth and in my father's h house are many Mansion yes sir coming into a new body coming into the change of the body Crossing Jordan is that right mean two things spiritual adoption and then full adoption as a change of your body listen to me I hope you catch these things because the devil is fighting the church especially right now on what Perfection is what adoption is and what the Thunders come to do that's what he's fighting he's trying to tell us I told the church last week that because of the of the teaching of the elders see we did not get into those things but when comes he don't care what the ERS say he's a of the tri of Judah he reveals to he will reveal hallelujah hallelujah amen because his love for ex hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah what does he say for Redemption that change the body why is he fighting that why we preach this this Wednesday if you were here are we following what the spirit is doing or we just listening to a good sermon and saying praise the Lord I'm hungry now let's go eat following what the spirit is doing I've always told you this what brother Ram said don't look at me look unto Jesus come on brother come people think oh you know there he goes again amen be careful watch the ear of our inheritance born in the family spirits of just men made perfect made semi perfect almost per oh perfect perfect Hallelujah remember when we C it last Sunday what was it in 61 Paradox message after it came out of the vision and he told us the scripture that open Purge the 11 Purge the Le and at the end that message he says I long to see a church I can look across the congregation and see a perfect people remember that you recorded that he said well sin will not be allowed of fire will come back andas and saf will come back see anas and saf they weren't born of the spirit no sir they were just Associates of the church oh my you say how do you know that brother the ghost in you will not do blasphemy against the Holy Ghost no no and that's exactly what they did because of that they fell dead right there and then what brother say that was 61 what brother say 634 of the Trump all these quotes them up per what was he kind it to but people are too caral and sometimes we listen to that carnality when we look at ourselves imperfect because we're looking at this guy right here well you if you got to come to recognition of perfection the word of God am and when that comes amen then you can come with boldness with security but yet humbleness before the Lord amen how you going to claim amen an inheritance if you don't believe your name is on the title brother mam said When you pray display the token in your prayer yes sir come on Amen because when the token is being displayed if you abide in me and my token my word in you ask what you will Hallelujah that's the word hallelujah ask what you will get us H amen amen so the token the blood did it have a voice right there was it speaking things it was speaking things it shows you that Paul knew brother the writer of the book of Hebrews one that was trying to establish the church by the holy spirit in that hour you exactly that the Old Testament and the first Adam and what was happened over there was exactly what was happening again amen amen what do we bring out Wednesday night oh brother that was something that came fresh Wednesday early that day amen yes what was it seven voices

in marriage yes oh wow don't get it upside down oh my oh no hallelujah amen amen so now what did they have the name that first church they have a name yes only for a small period of time they had the name they manifested the name until the denominational ages came all right let's at least start a little bit of this amen numbers num chapter 26 Numbers chapter 26 let's read numbers 26 how many like God's word when when God is trying to show us your life your experience your faith your Revelation what you're what you're receiving from him and perfectly showing you giving you something to stand on and know that your experience is not just some imagination some makeup stuff that oh yes I'm the bride and I'm this and not knowing who you are where you're at in the word anybody just says anybody can say I'm the bride I'm the Bri I'm manifesting the name I'm doing this amen when they try to do that in the first church demons knew yep demons knew yep who Jesus Christ was who Paul was but they didn't they didn't recognize No Authority in these young men they weren't manifesting the name they were trying to do what Paul did and just because oh he cast out Devils Jesus cast out Devils I can cast out Devils but Jesus said in my name he didn't say by my name in my name Hallelujah 26 and it came to pass after the plague what is it speaking of chapter 26 of numbers is the second time that the Bible is numbering a generation that's why this book is called numbers because in chapter one it begins with the Commandment of God to Moses to number or make a sentence whatever you want to call it of the people of the tribes of the fathers of the sons of all these people chapter one of Numbers chapter 26 of numbers is the new generation so from chapter one listen to me from chapter one chapter 26 40 years yes Hallelujah was in numbers was it yes it was chapter 13 chapter 14 this ain't this AES this Ain egpt this Ain this isther down this is right before entering into the land this is after chapter 25 which is the of let's allite become one and because of that God sent a plague of what what was the plague death was a p horse rider amen amen what was the last plag to the church death spiritual death and after that a new generation sir that's right chapter 26 came to pass after the plague amen is open right here to us amen amen and the opening of this scene shows us that the old Fighters the old generation were killed because of false in the of if you read numbers 23 24 and 25 you'll find is the way of B the error of the of and God's judgment has struck this old generation they're all dead but right here in numbers 26 he's recording their names of the new generation in the book but notice how he's doing it just like it was over there the only the only way their name can be recorded in the book is because of their birth brother ra said the invisible Union your name is trans from The Book of Life don't tell me talk to him the L's book of life amen amen when he said when your old husband dies he says he throws that book The see forgetful all accountability was in there all your things was in there he said he throws it in the sea forget trans that's the word he uses transfers your name The last's Book of Life that's happening right here right here numbers 26 the names of the new generation being transferred onto the book what happen the Lord spake unto Moses and unto El the son of a because A's dead aon's Dead's dead They're All Dead brother look take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel from 20 years old and upward throughout their father's house all there are able to go to war in Israel and Moses and elaser the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan showing you where they're at by Jordan near Jericho take the sum of the people 20 years old and upward as the Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel which went forth out of the land of Egypt see all right now it's the numbering of the new generation let's go to verse 63 these are they that were numbered by Moses and elzar the priest who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan nearer again again telling you where they're at they're at a junction time ready to enter into the father's house amen now look at this but among these were was not a man of them who Moses and Aaron the priest number not one of them were there save uh number when they number the children of Israel in the wilderness of for the Lord has said unto them they shall surely die in the wilderness and there was not left of a man of them save Caleb the son of jeze and Joshua the Son of God for only two that old generation are you with me are we in the scripture is this correct is there 40 years why 40 years because he swore in his wrath when they turned from KES bar remember 40 days remember it was 40 days what did God say a year per day how many REM that scripture you remember that scripture yes God said a year per day was 40 days amen that these spies had gone forth had been sent had come back with an evil report amen and what happened 40 years carasses shall fall in the desert they shall all die not come into the land why old time fires look at the new generation I'm trying to this is reality just make up look at the new generation mentality thinking about Egypt not thinking about Wilderness this Ain people that complain we want water that's over there generation concentration is should hallelujah amen inheritance but had already passed right there in the scriptures amen amen B had already passed see Hallelujah and they had seen what false Union does we're all one we're all this uniting with the world with denominations United with the new generation recogniz this the Bible say all these things are for our examples CL amen hallelujah so we're not concentrated on what happened over there and how there's we don't know nothing about no garlic oh no hallelujah amen we wer in Egypt we're born over here we don't nothing about no denominations amen see we don't know garlic and pots and we don't know none of that this is something else hallelujah hallelujah word of God see and that's why the concentration is get over get over into the new land now look why Jos the old generation as we seen last last Sunday what does that represent we told you Holy Spirit represents the end time leader Caleb the true and faithful believer how many believe there's faithful Believers from that from that Old generation yes sir amen I believe but what what is it showing you the big majority are dead come on brother amen oh not just the majority majority amen amen numbers 2628 okay what are we cooking up here numbers 26 28 ah here it is this new generation they had to trace their lineage their pedigree and the whole purpose of that was because the new generation had a desire Earnest desire to enter into the inheritance yes and this is where we want to get to the sons of Joseph after their families were man and there it it brings a tribe into place right it begins to give sons of the sons descendants and then it goes down to verse 33 and Z had the son of heph had no Sons but daughters and the names of the daughters of zop were Mala and Noah and hog hoga and you notice something about their names notice something about how many daughters they are how do we get to this we preach Josh if you read 16 17 of you'll find josua 17 in the promised land that these daughters right here these five daughters receive inheritance in the promised land now listen to me Joseph is a type of Christ is that right amen did Joseph have have an inheritance in the promised land did he died did Jacob his father bless him amen amen said do not leave my bones here but take my bones into the land when Jacob blessed Joseph it was a blessing for an inheritance was he one of the 12 sons yes one of 12 tribes of Israel amen his children were gentille have Gentile that's right amen they were Gentiles Joseph married a gentile wife and remember it was ephra and man that's what we read and then what happened why there's a scripture right here in verse 33 that didn't have no son but had daughters and gives the names specifically five daughters and this is not the only place where this is found this is something important hidden in the scripture because the very next chapter 27 speaks of them chapter 36 speaks of them first Chronicles 7 speaks of them Joshua 17 speaks of it so this is just a this a just anything there is something here amen amen look at this all their names in with a in with a yeah do they see oh J they have a part of God's name Hallelujah HEB Hebrew that's right brother J is that is that an attribute of God amen is a part of God's name Hebrew language that's right and all five of them have a part of the name is their name Hallelujah there are five virgins Hallelujah H and they WI because they're going to show you their wives yes they're five wise virgins and they show their wisdom of Revelation catch the name because the name is on the door oh brother this is powerful I might just stop right here cuz you might not receive it the same amen okay because let me just leave you with this look what they say so all these five daughters five virgin amen hallelujah girls amen they're not married yet there's no place that says they they get married later they're virgins and there's five of them and they're wise does that sound kind of familiar like something relevant to us maybe you know Matthew 25 somewhere there Midnight Cry shout 19 coming down seven Thunders to give rapturing Faith Hallelujah and what did he say in Genesis questions and answers on Genesis I'm getting ahead of myself okay what did he say the wise virgin had what what was there what was the oil in their lamps what was the oil in their lamps remember the quote questions and answers on Genesis I have the quote right here wise virgins see you won't receive it the same I already know you're not know it's been a long day you're tired amen been a long day wise virgins who had oil in their lamps hallelujah hallelujah there's something deeper in this what we think you know why what's our title what's our title our desire to manifest the father's name and obtain the inher their father remember we are the Church of the firstborn you know what the name Z zop means now brother Kevin's closest to me I'm what is mean all right the thing that cirle says had equals first born the name means first bornu that's what his name mean and these are the daughters of the the Church of the first and and and and and this father from the tribe of Joseph Hallelujah the Lage of Christ was Joseph a type of Christ he have a with seven colors is he the pyramid is he the statue of a perfect man with seven colors that's J perfectionist did he marry a gentile wife he have Gentile children amen is she going to reveal himself to his that's Jesus Christ y right to God and he represents the a see last week it was Lion now we're on ox oh Lord O yes sir the tribe of Joseph is the ox ephra and Manasses with the ban of the on the west am Hallelujah means first born oh my now what is this their father died and when this numbering is taking place because they're taking record where's brother remember almost about a year ago maybe some of you remember if you were there we had a Bible study at his house and in this Bible study at his house we're dealing with with uh choosing of a bride you know young men looking for a girl or something like that Hallelujah remember that remember that brother and we read some quotes from choosing of a bride and we read specifically numbers 36 where spoke of the daughters of zop but at that time we just took it for the natural application because what numbers 36 shows that these daughters were told do not marry outside of your tribe stay with your tribe remember that with your Tri world is not your tribe is not your Tri no sir brother said let it be a genuine believer first before looking for that you got to be looking for the Holy Ghost yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord and we taught on it and because back then almost a year ago the Lord led me to that scripture to the daughters of Z when I was reading Joshua 16 josua 1 Joshua 18 I read Joshua 17 and there they are of promise I said I remember them so you go back to the book of numbers and you find them and then God begin to open this up what is this this is powerful this is this is something real great know we've had a long day how many want to come back in the evening be a little more refreshed amen a little more energized and we can really bring this out does that sound good to you because this is something that is just real burning on my heart amen when God shows something like this especially showing exactly the hour that we're in something very great amen amen and when it comes into numbers 27 musicians come numbers 27 verse one says then came the daughters of zad the son of hepher son of Gilead the son of mat mat the son of manasse the families of manasse the son of Joseph these are the names of his daughters then says they stood before Moses and before elra the priest before the princes and all the congregation by the door Hallelujah of the Tabernacle the congregation at the hallelujah what was their desire of these of these daughters verse three our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of but died in his own sin and had no Sons he was not among among them cor amen no no no oh Hallelujah verse four why should the name notice Hallelujah why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he have no adopted I'm sorry son wow when the firstborn died there was no one to raise up and really take their place as an aded son Hallelujah there was nobody manifesting the name it had it had to be part of the scripture right here believe that script it had to be some time afterward after the first born passed off the scene there was a church there's a church of that first born was he first he was first born in the natural he was first born in the spiritual see the first born of the BR family amen amen was he the first one to rise from the the first to reach maturity is he the first one Amen to be born in the bright age Hallelujah but after he passed away on he had no Sons he had no one to stand and manifest the name that's what this is about brother not just to know the name not just to have the name Hallelujah right
