[42:31] today and I trust that it would be uh
[42:35] clear enough and simple
[42:39] Enough by the Holy
[42:41] Spirit not by human
[42:44] ability but may the Holy Spirit reveal
[42:48] it even to the to the simplest Among
[42:53] Us amen Revelation chapter 6
[42:58] where we want to
[42:59] begin then we'll be going into the book
[43:01] of
[43:04] eel verse one it
[43:08] says and I saw when the lamb opened one
[43:10] of the seals and I heard as it were the
[43:13] noise of
[43:16] thunder and one of the four beasts
[43:19] saying come
[43:25] in
[43:29] and I saw and behold a white horse and
[43:32] he that sat on him had a bowl and a
[43:34] crown was given unto him and he went
[43:37] forth conquering to
[43:47] conquer and when he had opened the
[43:49] second seal I heard the second beast say
[43:52] come and
[43:55] see
[43:59] there went out another horse that was
[44:01] red and with and power was given him
[44:05] notice this amen that sat there on to
[44:08] take peace from the earth that they
[44:09] should kill one another and there was
[44:11] given unto him a great
[44:25] sword see we find in verse two that it
[44:27] said it was given him a
[44:34] crown it was given him a
[44:37] bow amen amen these are things that
[44:42] someone is
[44:44] giving and that someone is
[44:48] God yes sir amen this God is permitting
[44:52] this because without God's permission
[44:57] the devil cannot do
[45:00] nothing verse five or verse four I'm
[45:06] sorry verse five and when he had opened

[1:07:22] my how many you
[1:07:26] know that the
[1:07:29] Bible will show
[1:07:34] you your own
[1:07:38] life you can see your
[1:07:42] past you can see your
[1:07:46] present you can see your
[1:07:48] future right here in the
[1:07:52] Bible you don't have to go and consult
[1:07:58] somebody just consult the one who made
[1:08:03] you amen hallelujah and how do you
[1:08:06] consult
[1:08:08] him you go to his
[1:08:10] word here is his
[1:08:14] mind here here is his
[1:08:17] plan and here is your
[1:08:20] name in mystery
[1:08:22] form and H in form it's in
[1:08:25] there but when you
[1:08:28] find amen your place in the word
[1:08:33] everywhere you turn
[1:08:35] then you'll see
[1:08:38] yourself amen But first you have to
[1:08:43] find Jesus
[1:08:45] Christ because he
[1:08:48] said this is what he
[1:08:52] said search The Script
[1:08:55] scriptures for they are they that
[1:08:58] testify of
[1:09:00] me amen everywhere in this
[1:09:04] word it speaks of
[1:09:07] him but if you are in
[1:09:12] him amen then it speaks of you
[1:09:17] too because you're part of
[1:09:19] him you are his
[1:09:22] bride you you are the
[1:09:25] one that is uniting with him hallelujah
[1:09:29] hallelujah and you can see the messenger
[1:09:32] of the
[1:09:33] age Amen in there
[1:09:36] too
[1:09:38] see you can
[1:09:40] see yourself in the
[1:09:42] word that's why when we're listening to
[1:09:45] the
[1:09:46] word when we're hearing the
[1:09:49] word amen we must apply
[1:09:51] Faith Hebrews chapter
[1:09:55] it says the word
[1:09:57] preached to them did not profit them
[1:10:01] because they did not apply
[1:10:04] faith when they heard the
[1:10:06] preaching amen amen and brother bam said
[1:10:10] we got to mix
[1:10:12] faith and when we're hearing the
[1:10:15] word what we're
[1:10:17] hearing what we're
[1:10:19] hearing is the word what we're hearing
[1:10:23] preach
[1:10:25] is the word so we got to take that what
[1:10:28] we're
[1:10:29] hearing and say yes I believe that I
[1:10:33] believe that is for me I believe that is
[1:10:37] possible I believe that God is speaking
[1:10:41] to
[1:10:42] me not to somebody else he's speaking to
[1:10:46] me and and he is telling
[1:10:50] me what what I what I can receive
[1:10:54] what he wants from
[1:10:56] me amen how I must walk how I must live
[1:11:01] how I must do that's how you listen to
[1:11:04] the
[1:11:06] word you don't listen to the word just
[1:11:09] to see what what part you
[1:11:12] like Oh I like that
[1:11:15] part oh that part uh I don't really like
[1:11:19] that that's not how you listen to the
[1:11:21] word you don't listen to the word word
[1:11:24] to see what part you like and what part
[1:11:26] you don't
[1:11:28] like you listen to the
[1:11:30] word
[1:11:32] conscience that there is a spirit of
[1:11:35] God behind what is being
[1:11:39] said amen amen and what's being said is
[1:11:43] being
[1:11:44] controlled by the Holy
[1:11:46] Spirit if if if if I am a true servant
[1:11:51] of
[1:11:52] God and not a
[1:11:55] hypocrite then you can believe
[1:11:59] that amen amen not because of
[1:12:02] me brother bam said all we have to
[1:12:06] do is just surrender
[1:12:08] ourselves that's a
[1:12:10] gift amen what is the gift brother bam
[1:12:14] said the man has to get out of the
[1:12:17] way amen I didn't plan on saying
[1:12:22] this amen I didn't plan in saying what I
[1:12:24] just said these past 10
[1:12:27] minutes that wasn't my plan but if you
[1:12:31] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:12:33] Spirit then you know there's a
[1:12:35] purpose behind what's being said how
[1:12:39] many understand say
[1:12:41] amen amen amen then we got to be
[1:12:44] conscience of that brother bam said
[1:12:47] Hebrews
[1:12:49] 12 when you look what do you see when
[1:12:53] you when you look to the pulpit he said
[1:12:55] don't look at the man look unto Jesus
[1:12:59] the author and
[1:13:00] finisher of our faith that's what we're
[1:13:03] looking at because what's coming out of
[1:13:06] here is Jesus what who is Jesus in the
[1:13:11] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:13:14] God and the Word was God so it's not
[1:13:19] imaginary I'm going to imagine that I'm
[1:13:21] looking at Jesus
[1:13:24] no it's not that you're
[1:13:26] imagining that you're looking at Jesus
[1:13:29] don't
[1:13:30] imagine faith is not
[1:13:33] imagination when you when you look see
[1:13:37] clearly that you're looking at Jesus in
[1:13:40] another form and that form is the word
[1:13:44] hallelujah hallelujah that's the form
[1:13:46] that you're looking at
[1:13:48] Jesus is that right glory to
[1:13:52] God amen how many love
[1:13:57] himu oh my Hallelujah God help
[1:14:01] me amen now I I don't know how to get
[1:14:05] into
[1:14:08] it amen amen it's okay now
[1:14:12] notice we
[1:14:15] read in Revelation chapter
[1:14:21] 6 we ran where shows up
[1:14:25] the history in the four first four
[1:14:31] seals the first seal second seal third
[1:14:37] seal fourth
[1:14:39] seal a seal is sealing
[1:14:44] something right
[1:14:46] Hallelujah like the
[1:14:48] seal on the cap of your
[1:14:52] juice
[1:14:56] right amen it is
[1:14:59] sealing what is contained inside of the
[1:15:04] bottle right amen when you break the
[1:15:08] seal then you are you have
[1:15:11] access to what's on the
[1:15:14] inside but when the seal is still
[1:15:19] sealed amen amen you can't pour anything
[1:15:24] out of
[1:15:24] it you can't partake of what's
[1:15:28] inside you got to break the
[1:15:32] seal you
[1:15:34] understand amen so these
[1:15:38] seals that the Bible speaks of they were
[1:15:42] sealing the Bible
[1:15:46] itself the seals were
[1:15:49] sealing a a a a Content a
[1:15:54] a something
[1:15:57] contained a
[1:16:00] revelation inside of this Bible amen
[1:16:05] amen we can go as I as we've done so
[1:16:08] many
[1:16:10] times we can go to the book of Isaiah
[1:16:12] and show
[1:16:14] you chapter
[1:16:16] 29 where Jeremiah prophesies and
[1:16:20] says the book is
[1:16:23] sealed to
[1:16:27] everybody even to the ones that go to
[1:16:31] school to
[1:16:33] study the
[1:16:35] scriptures the Bible says that the Bible
[1:16:39] says that the book The Bible is sealed
[1:16:44] even to the
[1:16:45] learned even to the
[1:16:48] religious even to the ones that have
[1:16:51] studied and their children children have
[1:16:53] studied and their children have studied
[1:16:57] and they have line a family
[1:17:01] line of of of learned
[1:17:05] men amen amen that study the
[1:17:09] scriptures they study the Greek they
[1:17:12] study the
[1:17:13] Hebrew they study the
[1:17:15] history they study all of these things
[1:17:19] amen amen the Bible
[1:17:21] says that
[1:17:24] the Bible itself is sealed to those type
[1:17:26] of
[1:17:28] people and then it also says and it's
[1:17:31] sealed to the to the normal
[1:17:35] people to the people that is
[1:17:38] uneducated the people that did not
[1:17:40] study to the people that is uh you know
[1:17:44] as what we say
[1:17:47] common amen amen so it's it's it's not
[1:17:50] just sealed to the common
[1:17:54] right amen People Like
[1:17:56] Us is also sealed to the
[1:17:59] learning and people in the religious
[1:18:03] World they they have in their mind in
[1:18:08] denominations and in
[1:18:10] religions they have in their mind that
[1:18:13] if you want to
[1:18:14] know the the the the the
[1:18:18] content of the Bible you have to study
[1:18:23] you have to go to school and you have to
[1:18:25] hear a
[1:18:27] professor tell you what what this
[1:18:30] means and the
[1:18:32] professor amen is teaching you what
[1:18:36] somebody taught
[1:18:38] him
[1:18:40] right the professor of that Bible
[1:18:45] College
[1:18:47] amen has spent years of his
[1:18:51] life
[1:18:53] learning what somebody
[1:18:56] else has
[1:18:59] interpreted to know what this Bible
[1:19:02] is and that someone else found it on his
[1:19:07] own amen amen but the Bible says it is
[1:19:12] of no private
[1:19:16] interpretation so you can't
[1:19:20] privately say well I think
[1:19:24] that this part of the
[1:19:26] Bible means
[1:19:29] this
[1:19:30] right I think that's what it
[1:19:33] means so that's what it is no just
[1:19:38] because that's what you think it
[1:19:41] is doesn't mean that's what it
[1:19:43] is the author has put it there for a
[1:19:48] reason and it has a true
[1:19:51] meaning and a true
[1:19:55] interpretation and that's why we believe
[1:19:59] in the prophet of God amen
[1:20:04] amen because the Bible says in Amos
[1:20:08] chapter
[1:20:09] 3
[1:20:11] verse that he these
[1:20:14] Mysteries and these secrets that are
[1:20:17] inside of
[1:20:19] the he reveals them to his the
[1:20:26] Prophet The Prophet is the one that is
[1:20:29] telling
[1:20:30] you what the Lord
[1:20:34] says that's why he has thus saith the
[1:20:40] Lord not thus sayth the
[1:20:42] prophet not thus sayth so and
[1:20:46] so thus sayth the
[1:20:49] professor amen no thus sayith the
[1:20:55] Lord so when we look at
[1:20:58] that we understand that there was a
[1:21:02] promise and that it was that this Bible
[1:21:06] was going to be
[1:21:08] opened these seals were going to be
[1:21:12] broken by Jesus Christ
[1:21:15] himself he was going to break the
[1:21:19] seal amen amen and and the
[1:21:24] content he was going to give it to his
[1:21:28] Prophet Hallelujah you understand so
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:32] content amen is the book
[1:21:36] itself you got to eat the book you got
[1:21:40] to eat the content that's
[1:21:43] inside you understand and then you begin
[1:21:47] to
[1:21:49] speak amen amen the the con
[1:21:53] content but where did you get it
[1:21:56] from you got it from a
[1:21:58] hand that come down from
[1:22:00] heaven is that what Ezekiel
[1:22:03] did amen amen did he receive it from a
[1:22:08] professor did he receive it from
[1:22:10] somewhere no brother this is coming from
[1:22:13] the Throne of
[1:22:15] God this message comes from the Throne
[1:22:18] of
[1:22:19] God Amen Hallelujah and it begins to
[1:22:25] reveal and
[1:22:27] unfold what these things really
[1:22:29] are not what a theologian
[1:22:32] thinks not what a professor
[1:22:36] said about 500 years
[1:22:38] ago no no no no this is
[1:22:42] revelation from God given to a prophet
[1:22:46] in this
[1:22:47] age as promised in the Bible to reveal
[1:22:53] all of these
[1:22:54] things and he begins to tell
[1:22:57] us see the the seal means
[1:23:00] this this fourth Beast right
[1:23:03] here this these four living creatures
[1:23:07] this is what they
[1:23:08] mean and you'll find them in Genesis
[1:23:13] you'll find them in Exodus you'll find
[1:23:16] them in Isaiah you'll find them in
[1:23:20] Ezekiel you'll find them in Jeremiah
[1:23:23] you'll find them in
[1:23:26] Zarah you'll find them in the four
[1:23:29] gospels amen you'll find them in the
[1:23:32] Book of
[1:23:33] Revelation who knows that where did that
[1:23:36] come from how do we know these things it
[1:23:40] come from
[1:23:42] God Amen you
[1:23:44] understand this is I'm trying to
[1:23:47] simplify
[1:23:48] it so you can
[1:23:51] understand that this this is not
[1:23:53] something that we're just you know kind
[1:23:55] of just saying
[1:23:57] or or or
[1:23:59] repeating brother this it has to be
[1:24:03] revealed amen and God has brought to us
[1:24:06] that
[1:24:07] Revelation how many are thankful for
[1:24:10] that how many are thankful for this
[1:24:13] message hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:24:17] this is
[1:24:18] precious this is more than this is more
[1:24:21] than gold
[1:24:23] amen I'm we're willing to give our
[1:24:27] life and everything for this
[1:24:31] word this is not just a religion to say
[1:24:34] yeah you know this this is what I do as
[1:24:36] my religion it's my
[1:24:42] hobby you know and then I have my own
[1:24:45] life aside of My
[1:24:50] Religion amen this is not that
[1:24:53] that this is the life of the of the
[1:24:57] word living inside of you is the only
[1:25:01] way that you can live the life of the
[1:25:05] word no other
[1:25:08] way it's not a
[1:25:10] covering it's not a
[1:25:12] religion it's a life that has to live
[1:25:15] inside of
[1:25:18] you and that produces according to its
[1:25:22] God
[1:25:24] that gives
[1:25:25] fruits now
[1:25:29] notice so we find that these four
[1:25:36] horses of
[1:25:39] death the White
[1:25:41] Horse the red
[1:25:43] horse the black horse The Pale
[1:25:49] Horse were being identified
[1:25:54] by the four living
[1:25:57] creatures who was
[1:26:01] identifying horse is a
[1:26:05] beast which in the
[1:26:08] Bible represents a
[1:26:12] power amen it's a
[1:26:15] power and this
[1:26:18] power is of
[1:26:21] Satan
[1:26:22] but is being given to
[1:26:25] us as a
[1:26:28] symbol of what this power
[1:26:32] represents how it
[1:26:34] works what it
[1:26:38] does and we
[1:26:41] see that the one that is opening
[1:26:45] this is the four living
[1:26:48] creatures this is
[1:26:50] powerful because it says says that when
[1:26:53] one of the seals
[1:26:56] open amen amen the first living
[1:27:01] creature was telling
[1:27:03] John come and see this so John is being
[1:27:07] able to
[1:27:10] see and and and write what is written
[1:27:14] here because the living
[1:27:17] creature is opening it to
[1:27:20] him amen amen you
[1:27:23] understand and the second and the third
[1:27:25] and the
[1:27:26] fourth see so in the in the first one we
[1:27:31] see that he comes with
[1:27:35] cunningness amen he is
[1:27:39] religious but he has something under
[1:27:42] under his
[1:27:45] sleeve right amen and then we begin to
[1:27:49] see in in in the second phase
[1:27:54] that he has he is given
[1:27:56] power right amen he is
[1:28:00] giving a power to take peace from the
[1:28:06] earth and they that they should kill one
[1:28:10] another and there was given to him a
[1:28:12] great
[1:28:13] sword amen amen then the next horse is
[1:28:16] showing us
[1:28:19] famine amen he he he is
[1:28:23] breaking the the
[1:28:28] economics of the world he has been given
[1:28:31] power to do
[1:28:33] this that there that that there be
[1:28:35] hunger that they would
[1:28:39] charge for prayers and stuff like
[1:28:43] that and then we begin to
[1:28:46] see how that uh he has a pair of
[1:28:49] balances in his hand
[1:28:52] the balances in the
[1:28:55] hand always have to do with buying and
[1:28:59] selling you find that in the Book of
[1:29:02] Genesis when Abraham was to buy
[1:29:06] property he had the balances in his hand
[1:29:10] he was going to pay the price for the
[1:29:12] for for the
[1:29:13] land amen where he was going to be
[1:29:17] buried where he was going to bury
[1:29:20] Sarah amen every body else is going to
[1:29:22] be buried
[1:29:24] there he had a
[1:29:26] balance that means he was going to he
[1:29:28] was going to
[1:29:29] buy and there was somebody
[1:29:32] selling so that's what balances
[1:29:36] mean amenu was there balances in the
[1:29:39] temple in the days of
[1:29:44] Jesus amen amen did they have
[1:29:47] balances amen did they have
[1:29:50] merchandise outside of the
[1:29:53] temple amen where they selling
[1:29:57] pigeons and
[1:29:59] Lambs right were they making
[1:30:03] business amen outside of the temple did
[1:30:07] they have
[1:30:08] balances amen they have money
[1:30:11] changers I I I don't have change oh we
[1:30:14] have money
[1:30:16] changers amen don't
[1:30:18] worry amen we can change from dollars to
[1:30:21] V
[1:30:23] Euros whatever you
[1:30:25] want right here we have money
[1:30:27] changers amen maybe you have Egyptian
[1:30:31] money maybe you have uh uh you know who
[1:30:36] knows uh Babylonian money we have the
[1:30:40] Changers right here amen they they'll
[1:30:43] give you Jerusalem
[1:30:46] money right you you got
[1:30:48] Rome see you have Changers here
[1:30:53] see brother sister that was taking place
[1:30:55] in the
[1:30:56] temple is that right Jesus came amen he
[1:31:01] he took some some some a pair of
[1:31:06] ropes amen and begin to whip
[1:31:09] people outside of the
[1:31:11] temple the lovely
[1:31:14] Jesus amen amen full of merciful and and
[1:31:19] and and love and tenderness
[1:31:23] amen begin to whip people outside of the
[1:31:27] temple and kick them out amen and
[1:31:31] turning over their
[1:31:32] tables amen all the change falling
[1:31:36] everywhere amen open up opening up the
[1:31:39] cages of the of the
[1:31:42] doves and letting them loose amen
[1:31:46] whipping the the the the
[1:31:49] sellers and anybody would get in
[1:31:53] between hallelujah
[1:31:56] hallelujah what did the Bible say the
[1:32:01] Zeal of my father's
[1:32:04] house has consumed
[1:32:06] me oh brother hallelujah amen that was
[1:32:10] that was in The Book of Psalms that was
[1:32:12] a prophecy even that action that Jesus
[1:32:17] did there was a prophecy in the
[1:32:20] scriptures the heal my father's
[1:32:23] house amen has consumed me oh brother he

[1:32:43] hallelujah he begin to whip
[1:32:46] people he begin to say you can't do this
[1:32:49] here this is not permitted
[1:32:52] this is a House of
[1:32:53] Prayer amen it's not a house to sell
[1:32:57] things it's not a din of
[1:33:00] Thieves you have no business doing that
[1:33:02] here get out of here amen amen see you
[1:33:06] begin to put things in order hallelujah
[1:33:10] amen amen you see
[1:33:13] balances represent buying and
[1:33:16] selling that's how we got into
[1:33:18] that
[1:33:20] Hallelujah
[1:33:23] but the fourth
[1:33:26] seal the fourth Beast
[1:33:30] says come and
[1:33:32] see and now when he sees he sees the
[1:33:38] horse of a of a
[1:33:41] color of
[1:33:44] pale which is a a
[1:33:47] combination of the
[1:33:49] white the red and the black
[1:33:53] together
[1:33:55] amen
[1:33:57] pale is that
[1:33:59] mixture you understand
[1:34:02] hallelujah amen brother Jesus can tell
[1:34:04] you about that
[1:34:06] right make some colors
[1:34:09] together make your own colors
[1:34:13] right amen so now
[1:34:16] notice when you look at this it is
[1:34:20] showing you that this
[1:34:23] power has the power all of the
[1:34:27] power that the other beasts
[1:34:31] had it has the power of the White
[1:34:34] Horse it has the power of the red horse
[1:34:37] that has the power of the of the black
[1:34:39] horse all combined
[1:34:42] together amen amen and this it it gives
[1:34:46] its
[1:34:48] name and the name is death and shows you
[1:34:52] that
[1:34:52] hell is open and Hell comes
[1:34:57] out to follow this
[1:35:00] power amen and then it says that power
[1:35:04] is given
[1:35:07] him over the fourth part of the
[1:35:10] earth notice to kill with the
[1:35:13] sword that's what the red one
[1:35:16] had and with Hunger that's what the
[1:35:20] black one had
[1:35:23] right amen and with
[1:35:25] death
[1:35:26] see that's how death came
[1:35:29] in by the white
[1:35:32] one the
[1:35:35] serpent using the
[1:35:38] word
[1:35:39] religious see amen and with the beasts
[1:35:43] of the
[1:35:44] earth now the
[1:35:46] reason we have taken already some time
[1:35:50] there
[1:35:52] is because when you go to the book of of
[1:35:56] Ezekiel turn with me to ezel
[1:36:05] 14 Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:36:09] Lord when you go to the Book of Ezekiel
[1:36:12] you'll find that there's something
[1:36:14] taking
[1:36:17] place in this part of of the history of
[1:36:20] the book
[1:36:23] that there is something taking
[1:36:25] place
[1:36:29] similar to what is taking place
[1:36:32] now because Revelation chapter
[1:36:35] 6 is is the
[1:36:39] mystery of the church
[1:36:43] ages the first four
[1:36:46] seals is revealing to
[1:36:49] you what was taking
[1:36:52] place in the spiritual
[1:36:56] realm during seven Church
[1:37:01] ages that was from the days of Paul the
[1:37:05] Apostle that was the first
[1:37:07] Messer to the first age all the way
[1:37:11] through seven
[1:37:12] ages to this last age the age of
[1:37:17] Leia where the last messenger
[1:37:21] William brandham William Bram was going
[1:37:24] to be the
[1:37:26] messenger amen amen to the Gentile
[1:37:29] world to bring the
[1:37:33] consummation of all the mystery of
[1:37:36] God and until the seventh angel
[1:37:39] according to Revelations
[1:37:41] 10:7 was going to be
[1:37:44] given the whole
[1:37:46] revelation of this mystery because it
[1:37:50] says when he begins begin to preach his
[1:37:54] message that mystery that was always hid
[1:37:59] is going to be made known it's going to
[1:38:01] be

[1:44:27] saying son of man when the land sinth
[1:44:30] Against Me by trespassing grievously

[1:44:34] and I will break the staff of bread
[1:44:36] thereof and will and will send famine
[1:44:39] upon it and will cut off man and Beast
[1:44:40] from
[1:44:49] it
[1:45:00] who is saying

[1:45:03] God is saying I'm going to do
[1:45:07] this people today say just the other day
[1:45:10] right brother

[1:45:27] God and why does he permit all of
[1:45:33] this amen that's right why is there

[1:45:53] famine amen amen I will cut off the
[1:45:57] people from the
[1:45:59] earth I will cut off the beast from the
[1:46:03] earth why because they
[1:46:06] sin and trespass against
[1:46:11] me see people think that the god of the
[1:46:14] Bible don't exist no
[1:46:17] more that that was just for the old
[1:46:19] times
[1:46:22] the Bible says Malachi 3 I am God and I
[1:46:26] change
[1:46:28] not Hebrews
[1:46:30] 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:46:32] today and
[1:46:34] forever you got to follow his
[1:46:37] word amen amen hallelujah he's a god of
[1:46:41] love but he's a god of
[1:46:46] judgment Hallelujah a god of
[1:46:49] righteousness and to have
[1:46:52] righteousness you
[1:46:54] need a
[1:46:58] law amen and you going have to have
[1:47:01] penalty for that law imagine if there
[1:47:04] was no law here in the
[1:47:08] city amen what would it be
[1:47:11] like there is Law and look at
[1:47:16] it what about without

[1:47:23] worse laws for
[1:47:26] purpose is to set
[1:47:29] order amen amen is that right it has its
[1:47:34] place as long as it's in the word when
[1:47:37] it gets outside of the
[1:47:39] word it doesn't have no
[1:47:42] place there's a greater law above
[1:47:45] that like Jesus told pilot you have no
[1:47:49] power
[1:47:50] over me except what's given to
[1:47:53] you from
[1:47:56] above see amen that that's the mind of
[1:48:00] Christ am amen whatever power they have
[1:48:05] is given to them from
[1:48:07] above but if the power that they are
[1:48:10] trying to
[1:48:12] exercise is not given from above it's
[1:48:15] got to be given from somewhere
[1:48:18] else amen that's devil now
[1:48:22] notice here it says in verse
[1:48:25] 14 though these three men knowah Daniel
[1:48:28] and job were in it they should be but
[1:48:30] deliver their own Souls by their
[1:48:32] transgression righteousness I'm sorry
[1:48:34] saith the Lord
[1:48:44] God if I cause noisome Beast to pass
[1:48:47] through the land and they spoil it so
[1:48:49] that it be desolate that no man may pass
[1:48:52] through because of the
[1:49:02] Beast though these Beast three men
[1:49:05] though these three men were in it as I
[1:49:06] live sayith the Lord God they shall
[1:49:08] deliver neither Sons nor daughters they
[1:49:10] only shall be delivered but the land
[1:49:12] shall be
[1:49:19] desolate
[1:49:25] or if I bring a sword upon that land and
[1:49:27] say sword go through the land so that I
[1:49:30] cut off man and Beast from
[1:49:40] it though these three men were in it as
[1:49:43] I live say the Lord they shall deliver
[1:49:44] neither son or daughter but they only
[1:49:46] shall be delivered themselves or if I
[1:49:48] send a pestilence into the land and pour
[1:49:51] out my Fury upon it in blood my to cut
[1:49:54] off from it man and beasts though Noah
[1:49:56] Daniel and job were in it as I live
[1:49:59] sayith the Lord God they shall deliver
[1:50:01] neither son or daughter they shall but
[1:50:03] deliver their own Souls by their
[1:50:19] righteousness
[1:50:35] this is an individual
[1:50:39] fa amen is that right it's an individual
[1:50:46] Affair not because Noah was there or or
[1:50:51] or job or
[1:50:54] Daniel Amen like in

[1:51:34] three could save the city from the wrath
[1:51:38] of God yes sir and and look what God is

[2:04:56] look
[2:04:59] but that
[2:05:01] people was
[2:05:04] divided into certain
[2:05:07] groups and there was three
[2:05:10] groups how many know that in every age
[2:05:14] there's three groups of
[2:05:17] people there's the

[2:05:26] world the sin amen well
[2:05:31] Ezekiel chapter 5 shows us
[2:05:34] this and Ezekiel is a sign how many
[2:05:38] remember
[2:05:40] that he is a sign he is
[2:05:44] representing all of the people of
[2:05:47] Israel and is
[2:05:49] representing like John all of the
[2:05:54] Bride but notice in Ezekiel chapter 5

[2:11:30] same
[2:11:32] level that the Prophet Jeremiah was in

[2:11:59] door and in the vision Ezekiel comes
[2:12:03] into the
[2:12:04] temple and sees the idol of
[2:12:08] jealousy amen the first thing he sees in
[2:12:12] the temple jealousy brother that is of

[2:12:45] jealousy yes sir
[2:12:48] and then and Ezekiel begins to see and
[2:12:52] the Lord shows him that there is a wall

[2:13:36] against it Ezekiel in Ezekiel chapter 8
[2:13:41] Ezekiel chapter n and Ezekiel
[2:13:45] chapter he's in the same vision

[2:13:52] Abominations seeing the same
[2:13:55] things amen amen and giving forth the
[2:13:59] final

[2:14:08] just by repetition like a
[2:14:12] parrot no sir no but he's he is in
[2:14:16] repetition by the spirit
[2:14:19] because he's in the same vision like
[2:14:22] Jeremiah he's in the same realm like
[2:14:26] Jeremiah he's not just
[2:14:28] repeating what Jeremiah said he's in the
[2:14:32] same
[2:14:33] vision like Jeremiah he's under the same
[2:14:37] anointing like Jeremiah that's the
[2:14:41] difference the difference is the

[2:16:05] can pour oil on it you can do all this

[2:20:54] comes to the person of the
[2:20:57] Antichrist there will be a power of
[2:21:01] deception an

[2:21:38] grandfather and you were produced down
[2:21:41] to your
[2:21:43] grandfather then your father and then

[2:23:26] what was but if that
[2:23:29] world is the same now this present evil
[2:23:34] age that we have been

[2:30:07] know you know the word you know the what
[2:30:10] Jeremiah said but if you continue in
[2:30:14] rebellion and that which craft is not
[2:30:17] broken from
[2:30:18] you oh brother sister there is
[2:30:23] wrath amen amen Hebrews chapter
[2:30:27] 6 amen a a a
[2:30:32] horrible judgment
[2:30:37] expectation yes sir is that what the
[2:30:40] Bible
[2:30:41] says after you have
[2:30:43] received the knowledge of the truth
[2:30:47] see amen the knowledge of the truth you
[2:30:50] know what the truth is amen Hebrews
[2:30:53] chapter
[2:30:55] 10 and then after you receive the
[2:30:58] knowledge of the
[2:31:01] truth amen you you turn
[2:31:05] again amen against the
[2:31:08] word see then there is there is no more
[2:31:13] sacrifice amen amen there's no nothing
[2:31:17] else and that's
[2:31:19] exactly where that that that time of
[2:31:22] Ezekiel
[2:31:24] was because
[2:31:26] brother once
[2:31:29] Ezekiel begins to see the reason
[2:31:34] why God is leaving
[2:31:37] them the reason
[2:31:40] why God is permitting
[2:31:43] this the reason why he's bringing
[2:31:47] Babylon there's got to be a
[2:31:51] reason there's an apostasy taking
[2:31:55] place amen the man of sin cannot be
[2:32:00] revealed until the first be an
[2:32:04] apostasy amen the
[2:32:06] church
[2:32:08] allows this to
[2:32:11] happen why because of their condition
[2:32:15] amen amen amen
[2:32:17] their
[2:32:18] condition amen amen forces
[2:32:22] God to permit
[2:32:26] this you
[2:32:28] understand God God God can do
[2:32:33] nothing the church in this
[2:32:37] condition amen amen God has to let this
[2:32:40] judgment
[2:32:42] go for severe judgments come
[2:32:47] and swipe the
[2:32:51] land famine
[2:32:56] hunger Terrible
[2:32:58] Things death no
[2:33:03] peace
[2:33:05] because the people that are supposed to
[2:33:08] bring peace to the
[2:33:12] Earth the the people that are supposed
[2:33:14] to cry out
[2:33:17] amen amen and confess their
[2:33:20] sins and God will come
[2:33:23] down and heal the
[2:33:25] land Hallelujah they're not doing
[2:33:31] that they're in another
[2:33:34] condition and because of
[2:33:37] that God sends this
[2:33:40] wrath how many are
[2:33:43] understanding
[2:33:45] amen why are they
[2:33:48] rebellious because they have
[2:33:51] heard they have received enough
[2:33:59] knowledge of the word of the
[2:34:03] Lord and
[2:34:06] still they're rebellious against
[2:34:10] it that is the condition that Ezekiel
[2:34:14] will see in the church in
[2:34:18] amen and what did he what did he see the
[2:34:22] glory of God
[2:34:24] glory raise
[2:34:26] up from the
[2:34:28] Cherub the glory of God that was in upon
[2:34:33] The Mercy
[2:34:35] Seat where the cherubs
[2:34:37] are amen where the blood was
[2:34:41] sprinkled once a year in the
[2:34:45] temple the glory that was always
[2:34:49] there since the days of
[2:34:53] Moses in the
[2:34:55] wilderness the glory came in and filled
[2:34:57] the
[2:34:58] house Solomon built the the
[2:35:02] temple amen and the glory filled the
[2:35:05] house amen since that time the glory was
[2:35:09] always
[2:35:11] there but Ezekiel
[2:35:14] sees that that Glory
[2:35:17] lifts
[2:35:18] up from The Mercy
[2:35:22] Seat that's the only
[2:35:24] way that wrath can
[2:35:28] come Hallelujah but at the same time
[2:35:31] that that Glory that lifts us lifts up
[2:35:35] from
[2:35:37] there comes
[2:35:41] inside inside of
[2:35:44] Ezekiel Hallelujah Hallelujah it comes
[2:35:47] upon another Mercy
[2:35:50] Seat it comes inside of a
[2:35:53] people in this last
[2:35:56] day amen that's where the glory
[2:36:01] is the glory has lifted
[2:36:04] up and brother Bram said let me read
[2:36:08] this quote in
[2:36:11] closing as our brother plays
[2:36:14] Softly
[2:36:19] knoweth it
[2:36:22] not he's speaking of
[2:36:25] how he tries to warn the
[2:36:31] people try to tell
[2:36:36] women how they
[2:36:38] must
[2:36:41] act they don't want
[2:36:44] it the Bible tells you
[2:36:47] how they don't want
[2:36:52] it he says I try to it's like a
[2:36:56] doctor that has the
[2:37:00] medicine and tries to pour it down the
[2:37:02] person's
[2:37:06] mouth but still they spit it
[2:37:11] out and the doctor tries to put his hand
[2:37:14] over their mouth
[2:37:17] so they won't spit it out and they still
[2:37:20] they spit it in between his
[2:37:24] [Music]
[2:37:30] fingers he said you cannot blame the
[2:37:35] doctor people blame God all the
[2:37:39] time amen M you can't blame the
[2:37:44] medicine
[2:37:46] but the
[2:37:48] attitude of the
[2:37:52] person
[2:37:54] amen it'll be a horrible day one of
[2:37:56] these
[2:37:58] days when this sinful adulterous
[2:38:03] generation stands before almighty
[2:38:06] God I see my
[2:38:08] [Music]
[2:38:10] years creeping up my my shoulders
[2:38:14] stooping
[2:38:16] [Music]
[2:38:20] 33 years on the
[2:38:24] field a long
[2:38:27] life 33 years of
[2:38:31] service and I don't regret I don't have
[2:38:33] one
[2:38:40] regret this might be my last
[2:38:44] opportunity
[2:38:46] while here in this
[2:38:48] Mortal to preach the
[2:38:51] gospel God help me to stand true as true
[2:38:53] can
[2:38:56] be to that
[2:38:59] word says
[2:39:02] notice Methodist
[2:39:05] women Pentecostal women you tell
[2:39:11] them shouldn't wear
[2:39:13] this you shouldn't do that to your head
[2:39:17] you shouldn't do this or that women that
[2:39:20] claim to be
[2:39:22] Christian they should know
[2:39:26] better they're
[2:39:31] rebellious watch what brother man says
[2:39:33] here he says the higher you rise in
[2:39:41] God the more sinful the whole thing
[2:39:44] looks
[2:39:51] and then sometimes in
[2:39:55] prayer you can
[2:39:57] imagine when the Holy
[2:39:59] Spirit take you up into a
[2:40:04] sphere then the whole thing looks
[2:40:11] chaos and then you come back
[2:40:14] down
[2:40:17] and it seemed like to the people that
[2:40:19] you're a
[2:40:23] rascal you're nothing but an old
[2:40:28] sarcastic you're a
[2:40:31] fool because you stand as an old
[2:40:35] crank always rebuking the
[2:40:37] [Music]
[2:40:39] people but if you ever climb into them
[2:40:44] spheres one time
[2:40:46] where you can be in the presence of
[2:40:51] God not through
[2:40:54] emotion but through the genuine Holy
[2:40:58] Spirit lifting you
[2:41:01] up then you will
[2:41:04] see that the whole
[2:41:06] thing is
[2:41:10] wrote the glory of the Lord has Departed
[2:41:16] from the whole denominational
[2:41:20] outfit that's
[2:41:22] right there is none of
[2:41:25] them that is
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:34] right Ezekiel
[2:41:39] Saw all these
[2:41:42] Abominations they saw the
[2:41:44] glory lift
[2:41:47] up when the glory
[2:41:50] [Music]
[2:41:51] departs it
[2:41:54] means the glory of the
[2:41:57] Lord has
[2:42:00] departed but where does it
[2:42:06] go it has to go
[2:42:08] somewhere the Bible says that in this
[2:42:12] day he was going to shake everything
[2:42:16] hallelujah amen he was going to shake
[2:42:19] the
[2:42:21] heavens he was going to shake the
[2:42:23] Earth yes sir
[2:42:26] brother he was going to shake
[2:42:29] everything is that right Hai chapter
[2:42:33] [Music]
[2:42:37] 2 verse six for thus sayith the Lord
[2:42:40] hope of hosts yet once it will is a
[2:42:43] little while and I will shake the
[2:42:44] heavens and the Earth and the Sea and
[2:42:46] the dry land and I will shake All
[2:42:49] Nations and the desire of all Nations
[2:42:51] shall come and I will fill this house
[2:42:53] with glory sayth the lord of
[2:43:10] hosts the silver is mine the Gold is
[2:43:13] mine sayth the Lord of hosts
[2:43:17] the glory of this latter house shall be
[2:43:19] greater than of the former sayith the
[2:43:21] Lord of hosts than is his place will I
[2:43:24] give peace sayth the Lord of
[2:43:35] hosts hallelujah hallelujah when the
[2:43:39] glory
[2:43:40] departed oh
[2:43:43] my it's got to fill another
[2:43:47] house oh when the restoration took
[2:43:52] place and all of the
[2:43:54] years that these four Killers
[2:44:00] killed when that was restored
[2:44:03] back after the 70
[2:44:06] years in captivity they came back into
[2:44:09] the
[2:44:10] land hallelujah amen that was God's
[2:44:14] plan
[2:44:15] he said they will go
[2:44:18] captive they'll they'll be
[2:44:21] destitute famine and pestilence and
[2:44:24] plags they'll be taken
[2:44:27] away but I will bring them back
[2:44:32] too and they will worship
[2:44:35] me with one heart with one
[2:44:41] vision and they will not go in many
[2:44:44] different direction
[2:44:47] directions they'll have one
[2:44:49] way one truth and one life hallelujah
[2:44:54] amen that was God's
[2:44:56] plan and after that when they came
[2:45:01] back restored the temple raised it back
[2:45:05] up edified it back up and the
[2:45:09] glory fill the house
[2:45:12] again and the glory of the second
[2:45:17] house was greater than the glory of the
[2:45:21] first hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[2:45:24] place where we're at Brothers s we must
[2:45:28] recognize that if the glory has
[2:45:31] departed from everywhere
[2:45:33] else he got to fill a
[2:45:36] house of God it's got to fill the
[2:45:41] temple amen amen heavenly father in this

[2:46:34] permit even this this great thing that
[2:46:37] will
