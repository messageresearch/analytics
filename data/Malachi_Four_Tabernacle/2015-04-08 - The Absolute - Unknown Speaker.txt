TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the inspiration that we received of Sunday morning as we were preaching some things the Lord had to say that it wasn't really in our notes okay just meditating on that is a benefit to help amen because when we understand the one that that wants to bring these things to our attention then we can understand amen it is it's for a purpose and that purpose is that we might walk in that word we might manifest that comments so he wants to bring it to our attention he wants us to understand and he wants us to walk in there so we want to speak on the absolute tonight maybe touch a few things a bit not as we maybe have heard it before just in the way that brother brings it hear the message it's really something that uh okay this in connection with Unlimited I think it's an ultimate an absolute it's used many times it's the last word it's the amen you hear people say absolutely absolutely that's the last thing it's unlimited see right that takes from here tied to every great achievement has been an action absolutely to every person everything that's been there or done rather there has been an absolute connected with it there's got to be something for It's the final time folks and man cannot by no means achieve anything I get closer so there comes somewhere where they recognized that there is God has given us an absolutely this is the hour of the action because Revelations 3 14 says amen that he is the amen is that right he the beginning the creation of the creation of God foreign all right come in then brother Madam goes on to tell us he says in this crucial hour that's where they're like this we must have something that we are positive people some things to know whether how case the case is going amen amen and the absolutely hit itself and see it is Unlimited in power primarily is an ultimate is an amen that's everything amen amen he says you've got to you've got to have everything is all you've got to have somewhere where you can tie down how many believes that you have to stand for something in this house Hallelujah if you don't stand for something amen amen so you have to have some please where you can tie yourself too is that right I mean Paul says it in Hebrews it's the anchor of the Soul amen amen lies behind the veil is that right now we have to have somewhere especially in these times of time amen where he said in the absolute message that is like in the days of the judges amen when after the days of Joshua Joshua had left to see is here doesn't make remember this uh Sunday how we were reading the quotes and looking at how I'm giving this uh this testimony many many times all over the message how he spoke to a Catholic priest and then we're speaking about yeah the authority of the word and brother Venom said that this Catholic priests or debate with him to say God is in his church amen amen because the Catholic church is the one that has a right to you know move whatever thing the work says in other words whatever they say Amen that the Bible means saying well that's an heir person God's in his church but to see when you when you like we were saying Sunday many can take that and fail to see the Promise oh what he wants done with the word foreign back to the face of the father so welcome the Lord Jesus when he returns she'll be hearing from the spirit she said but the spirit give his life God made it in such a way that no matter how much man can study the letter of the word amen the letter of the word being fulfilled is always by the spirits fulfilling that word but it's so contrary it's in a way that when they would hear it there was coming a foreign oh great shaking taking place down there at the river Hallelujah foreign sound the voice of one pride in the wilderness he was in the Fulfillment of the world Amen of God to fulfilled the word hallelujah we were waiting for the Messiah to come down to the couriers of Heaven amen and a red carpet to fly down to Jerusalem and coming to the temple according to the prophecies amen and all these things and they were all you know marvelous the precious words that came out of his mouth hallelujah amen and they wanted to throw the Bible says but Jesus there's always a fulfillment of the words amen many times yes fulfilling that word in such a way that only the elected yes what is taking place they are connected foreign and they were redeemable to become the sons of God if we could stop here for a moment if it would be possible the message but he says that when Jesus Christ our names were put on the lamps Book of Life Hallelujah Hallelujah he wants to wear Hallelujah foreign son of Jesus had something to tell them you're gonna tell them now now you have to be the light of the world now you have to be the salt of the earth amen amen no continuation amen the father will sin the country Hallelujah it won't be you fulfilling the words foreign put it on the whole armor of God 1962. he said the word of the Garden of Eden spoken word Satan knocked it down is that right all right he said that the word become twitch and they crucified amen amen and he said but now there's a difference in the world right when he said that he said oh that was in the Farms amen has become the words so the church has become the word from the church that's always amen because the reason why God has made all this accessible to us but we have the privilege from Genesis to revelation do you have that privilege amen right there's a reason for it why do we have a message in this house why is it in letter forms and computers okay what's his word amen amen amen you see what I'm saying will pass away amen but his word never passed away it's gonna remain and he's coming for himself amen I noticed reason why we're speaking on this tonight when you look at that we're standing meditating than that yeah Holy Spirit brought this to my memory that's exactly what Jesus said the spirit of truth is foreign or the Branham is speaking about the three rounds the human being that is first Thessalonians says that we're to preserve our body Soul experience Hallelujah preserve your body experience amen amen it's the Saints okay Los Santos that is there's going to be a people why not only their spirits but their bodies it also shows us that we're trying beans brother man I'm in this message is talking about how people in this last day you know right no it's not this age of literacy amen amen and there's noodles friendship Miserables amen that's the title of this message Rosales brother Madam in this message talking about how the Holy Spirit falls upon the people okay and they can have all of this same emotions that the true genuine matter well there's a difference in the fears of our being and brother bam says he says look at the Baptist people look at the methodists brother Adam is speaking about what they have it as people in their church and they have an ultimate he says they have an option they have a title absolutely and it's what they're taught their Baptist Church or in their Methodist Church how many understand that whatever they're taught amen amen that's what's in them Allelujah they can't read nothing else it is produce more methodists whatever you are here whatever you are receiving foreign yeah that's who you are that's what you are right remember start listening to worldly music and see what happens send a message without money without price he said he said no matter how much we try to raise our children in The Godly fear of the Lord he said in his soul there's a nature says in the moment he hears rock and roll music he said he will be attracted to them amen right and then he then he gives a story you know what I like story remember that but I mean about the sailors and we're going to travel by a very a very uh Island that was very well known for Ambush it would kill whatever Sailors would go back and the captain knew this so he told the sailors the way that they lure people into this island he said they play real beautiful music and they make it attractive and then the sailors hear that they come towards the island now something going on right to tell them say let's pull to the highway but they kept going and they reached another part yeah hallelujah amen and then that other poor is there in the pier again amen amen he heard the most beautiful music so tremendous amen way more uh attractive and on a higher level than what he would hear in the island hallelujah amen when they got back on the ship the shaders were ready to tie them up again hey man because they were going to go back the same way and the captain said you don't have the time amen oh man you don't have the time they don't think about it because I've already heard okay now we eat something more Supply okay so when I pass by that foreign amen turning over her right she had you know a lot of things she she you know it hurt to leave behind us how it is today he says meet me in the church are there but their heart is somewhere else there's a lot of difference between a pillar of salt and a pillar of fire Hallelujah you can be a pillar of fire or you can be a pillar of salt amen which Memorial You Wanna Be Hallelujah and it has to be in the soul has to be a Thai food something in Italian that has to be in your soul because that's where you're controlled okay this is he he only he only receives orders is that right the one that's on the deck hey man he's been told what to do see what the one down in in the chamber is that right man he's the one in control it's like a sign of your throat is that right yeah brother man type that is a human beings he said the one that's controlling the is down in here and this is the man of the dead yes these people in these churches and want more than us they have their ultimate they have their absolutely he says foreign pastor and here and I would go to the pastor and he'd say that's that was something back younger okay we Baptist we we what we believe we believe we should be immersed in the titles of fathers and holy ghosts that's all the way that's the way the church does it is since John Smith founded it John Smith and that's the way it's done well that's your ultimate and then he says heck with those guys what those guys say what if you're a methodista sprinkling is your sister Los Angeles you're told to be versed to go back to your Methodist Pastor Jill Wright and ask the bishop yes and he'll write him and ask what about foreign and all these things like this and the holy uh helpers isn't a wafer yet because it's a spirit okay so they speak and so far in our documents if your church is it is your ultimate you don't give a hoot what anybody says that's your ultimate hey he said oh God help this is to me I mean the whole thing is wrong my last words whatever the word says up here in these spheres that you could ever be in this little Inside Man you have to be foreign foreign amen head over is not down here in the third man in the soul that's predestinated from God hallelujah her ultimate is an organization that's when our organization and then he says listen to that man listen to how he's saying he said her ultimate is not down here in the third man let's predestinated is an organization out of this Festival every denomination hallelujah amen it's been formed by some kind of uh seclusion of the scripture amen amen they say this is the words we believe right here and here it is right there yeah amen I mean Jehovah's weakness will tell you what they believe is in the Bible Baptist all these guys to tell you what they believe is in the Bible you understand that's the ultimate is out fairies they in other words he says that's a man that's organized but if the word of God it says amen and lines up with this is that little typos listen to what he calls it's that little typos the seed of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world I don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay that's why that woman will wear them shorts and she's counted a prostitute the same as a woman in the app how Hallelujah amen amen that's it then the thing is brother man I'm showing us that that kind of that absolutely it's absolutely has to be in the show and in order to come in there the soul had to be predestinated of God to be here for a day now that's the only one that's a big quick but I said he got a lot of the Holy Spirit when it's not the spirit of the day that we're living that's the only one remember every age only got a dip foreign foreign he says two or three hour message and I just got started but it was too tremendous I don't know whether the people got it or not I hope there was some good tapes on it so I can so it could be carried out to be known that I believe with all the message that I that I have ever brought to you that absolute that was absolute was ordained of God the regular commission seals and things that was directly the word of God what I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that that one was it okay the one that is needed to follow the seals it's capital spoke to that little boy you know called him and told him his condition and pronounced his healing the mother's parents whatsoever was taking him back to the doctor and the doctor said he had a new set alarm I understand that the parents are somebody called the long distance call to let it be known to the congregation notice he is the Creator and to make a new shed alone this is desperation we're on the verge of one of the most mightiest things that ever struck the Earth since the days of the Lord Jesus but now we can we can only be known needles it'll be so humble what man calls my idea calls Abominations if you're if you're not about the tokens you know to examine it if you don't have the tokens Hallelujah if you don't have the tokens let me read that again one of the most mightiest things in the days of the Lord Jesus the fullness amen yes the fullness of God that we do that he obstructed in the days of the Lord Jesus Christ because okay in this hour in this hour we are living amen is the Fulfillment of these things this is what the bride is to be fulfilled in this house and tell you the truth this is what she is but you can only see it if you're part of it you can only see it if you're about to talk amen I mean everybody else all of us cannot see them because they do not have that actually amen amen now notice we begin to see then that what was in Jesus Christ all that was in God important in Christ we read Saint John 14 20. it was and the message cries it's a mystery of God revealed he says God is making himself known not not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government but by the revelations Christ in you the history as God of yours was in Christ what did God what God did in Christ does in you what signs God okay didn't cry in Arcadia he says when this Revelation is made known that I am in the Father the father in me right and you and me when the revelation you see the threefold and then he stops he says you see the threefolds what for but again to bring back all right we've got to be and it was as Jesus was the word he was Vindicated the same of every the other one if he wasn't he no he was if he wasn't the word he wouldn't have made manifest the word did you hear that on your hand if he wasn't the words he wouldn't have made manifest the word he'd have been some great theologians that would have been a real Messiah to the world was looking forward that would have been him well what they were looking for what they're looking for today if somebody to exceed Billy Grahams or some can smother down with their organizations some of you for he was the world and I live alone and you live by every word how I'd like to take a tax all right come on thanks for the ass and preach now for a couple of hours it's hallelujah hallelujah as a father that sends Jesus that sends us yes God in Jesus all right would be revealed he was talking about the second fold in Revelations right there son of man challenge okay because she is taking place in this prize Jesus Took My Place let me hold true to it until I got me feeling not to the church he says oh no that's spiritual union of Christ and his church is becoming the world and the words it's becoming flesh amen from the flesh like how does this becoming the word foreign thank you absolutely a few shoes hallelujah hallelujah foreign foreign whether they are connected Group 17 localities amen amen this is what he says in the message he says the things these signs and different things are happening having that time to do it will in another message but there's one thing here that is lacking in the church we want to get to that I'm going right on the edge of it now you must do it the United time is at hand for God is getting the church together for the Rapture to go on the wedding for the great Union he says when God and man will you not for eternity it was once done in the form of the son of man one is on Earth it was once done and he says it was once done this is what he's talking about the union between the Christ and his church and then he says it was already done once before but in the form of the son of man on Earth he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite men for the bride parallel of Jesus and now the church is United itself to the body of Christ getting itself ready Union among them the bride of Christ travels the same Journey that Abraham did yeah the last sign that Abraham was seen was the promised son foreign but in between the Son of God and the son of nature according to his own words according to malachite in human beings in the way of being a prophet prophet it's a prophetic thing prophetic in the people he promised according to us for many scriptures in the physical form not from a physical in the people in human beings God's provided place of worship he says he promised just before the coming of the end time with their feet the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man come down in a human form three of the two angels and God himself the Bible said it was he come down and he's manifested himself there turning his back that's right Jesus himself said as it was on the days of the at the day when the son of man has been revealed in

fourth stage in the stages of Greece justification sanctification baptism the holy ghosts the Perfection of the son of man and the church amen amen into the Perfection of the son of man cuando the
