plain make it clear amen and when that happened Esther was a little reluctant she was a little hesitant she says does it uh how can the message tell me to do that there's a law that says that if I go into the presence of the king without being summoned I'll be killed amen she was afraid she was hesitant to the responsibility that the ministry was letting her know she had because was not in

saw him transfigured on the Holy Mountain hallelujah hallelujah cu the holy God was on the mountain yes sir that's right amen and when we seen that glory to God we have a sure word of Prophecy amen that we keep in in line with this prophecy if you take heed if you receive this word of Prophecy that we have when we see this revelation of the com of the Lord not Transfiguration when you see that

Hallelujah so all listen to this say in the same message I just quot is the rising of the sun where he says she is him in that same message he says every scripture that spoke of the bridegroom of that's what he said are you listening speaks of the bridegroom speaks of the Bride sir so what scriptures speak of the bridegroom he is the Morning Star he is the lily of the valley Hallelujah glory

where the Virgin and the lion come on Hallelujah Stars brother the first Bible Hallelujah if you just pull with me tonight said if iish iish but I'll stand for the word of this says that the spoken word is the original se he says I believe that someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word the prophecies in Revelations 13:16 denominations will force the bride to stop or to take its Mark that's when the lamb will take his bride and judge the hallelujah amen Amen brother says Philadelphia church I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all of the world and try them that are upon the Earth brother says this this temptation is exactly like the Temptation Of Eden the same Temptation that happened in the Garden of Eden it's going to come at the end time upon all the world and what is this it's it's an inviting proposition held up in direct opposition of God's commandment but notice the very elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started what seems a beautiful blessed principle Christ prayed that we all be one become so strong politically that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her amen amen and adher to the principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless they are in direct or indirect denomination did you hear you will not be acknowledged as churches unless you are direct or indirect already in the message now that indirectly indirectly they're part of that already you say that can't be so people in the message right brother indirectly and the little groups yes will lose uh privileges amen until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people unless the local Ministerial Association approves in most cities most cities one cannot rent a building for religious Services amen am unless you're part of the organization you cannot rent buildings unless you're part of the organization to become chapain of the Armed Forces or hospitals it is now mandatory to accept the trinitarian eal groups Prophet saying this in this back there eal groups this pressure will increase and increase harder and harder to resist is to lose privilege so many will be tempted and will feel that it is better to serve God publicly than not to serve God at all publicly but they to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah or whatever you want to call him but the elect will not be deceived furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image Ed to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture hallelujah hallelujah they will be taken away brother there's to be to say if iish I stand in that hour with unwavering faith holding the token upon your family what was doing this is the hour don't you understand what the holy spirit is telling us you think I'm just preaching little nice Sermon Just to excite you just to say oh that's a good message oh that's powerful no the holy spirit is letting us know what is here what's upon us what our responsibility is hallelujah hallelujah spiritual food in this season that doesn't make me something no but by the grace of God the holy spirit is trying to let us know amen that there must be a love in each one of us that's right brother Jesus Christ was a in human flesh and that love let him lay aside all selfishness it made sh the eyes I I I said eternal life is to live for others that's what Esther did she counted not her life worthy but she laid it down for the purpose of the kingdom of God Jesus said he that saves his life for his own cause Shall Perish but he that loses his life Hallelujah are you giving your allu the the test is coming the temptation's coming cuz he was going to stand in that hour am amen and there's many they are going to stand but they're going to die but they're son they're going to stand and speak the word and those that stand and speak the word are going to change the situation for the Bri of Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's good brother no man haser love that he will lay down his life for his friends hear ye him hallelujah what did he do when he went up to mount Transfiguration and receive that power from that cloud God he went straight to the Cross how long did Jesus last after Mount Transfiguration brother that was at the end

understand and after he received that adoption after he receiv received that position Hallelujah after his name became as good as the father's name glory to God amen he went straight to the Cross

Church age then he says notice this is powerful amen he says the knowledge of the most high has almost ceased death has overcome the things of God are at its lowest end it seems that Satan will surely conquer God's people but notice like over there in the Dark Ages when it was totally dark almost all dark they needed the morning in this hour we need the morning St because it's total darkness this is why the spirit is promising the Morning Star he is telling them that the chief star Jesus who dwelle in light no man can approach in the future Kingdom he will illuminate them by his personal pres
