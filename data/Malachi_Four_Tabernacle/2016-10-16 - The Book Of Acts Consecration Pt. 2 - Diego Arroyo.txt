TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the second read the first pong as we said there at the end of the prayer see how the Holy Spirit God can be able to see this but brothers and sisters we must pay close attention because many times when we miss a part of the message we're not understanding another part of How It's in connection we don't see the connection we're not following the spirit how it's trying to teach us and show us I believe the holy spirit is here now he promised to guide us and lead us to all truth yes M said when you look what do you see let us look into Jesus the author and finisher of our faith Amen in Jesus is the word and the word revealed is here this morning amen hallelujah he's here today am let us look him Christ revealed in his own word hallelujah hallelujah and we're going to read in Psalms Psalm 2 going to read from the first verse all have it amen why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine of vain things the kings of the earth set themselves and rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and Cast Away their cords from us he that sth in the heavens shall laugh amen the Lord shall have them inion Hallelujah God has sense of human amen Remember The Days of Elijah how Elijah was mocking the prophets of B man say maybe your God is gone off on a on a trip scream a little louder he he doesn't hear you maybe he's AEP amen amen amen hallelujah amen right Jesus told the disciples go and tell that F amen hallelujah amen and David is speaking under the spirit of Prophecy inspiration in hiss amen amen David is aetu a writer of inspiration amen when you see this he prophesying of what men and kings are going to do on the Earth amen they're going to gather themselves together to come against the Lord and against his anointed amen amen amen but then David is changed from seeing the scene of the earth says but the Lord he that Reigns in the heavens amen yes amen verse five then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and Vex them in his sore displeasure yet have i s my king upon my Holy Hill I will declare the decree Lord has said unto me thou art my son this day ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron you know that that's in the book of revation it's a promise to the amen yes Jesus is going to rule with the rod of iron Hallelujah amenah he is saying here ask of me I shall give Thee the healing for th ask of me Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel be wise now therefore ye Kings be instructed ye judges of the Earth serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with TR kiss the son L he be angry he perish from the way his wrath is kindled blessed are all they that put their trust in let PR heavenly father thank you Lord God the reading of this second Psalm believe it's your Eternal Word as your Prophet has showed us Lord we can see it through the scripture it's impossible humanly for men that wrote scriptures holy men of God holy sages and Sears move Lord to write this hundreds and hundreds of years apart one from another and they all lived in their day and their generation they all Liv their time and lived out the word that you lot it for them but yet it's all in agreement it all comes together Lord It's Your Holy Spirit we can see that today after the prophet Liv years before us spoke things we can see that your holy spirit amen taking that word father quickening it to our hearts bringing us into the same channel of inspiration under the same anointing father this eternal word yes Lord we thank you for ask that you bless your word word to every heart and may this time Lord that you have exhorted us this Friday consecration as we Endeavor father today with your word May the people father your children receive it Lord through your Holy Spirit In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen May seated turn with me to the book ofs we mentioned Friday how that we were in the book of Acts is that right the Lord is leading Us in this in this line of inspiration and today we are speaking on the book of Acts again and this would be the second part of consecration we began Friday recorded it's on there and this would be the second part where I believe the holy spirit is really going to make it clear and see the connection and we have already spoke Friday what consecration has to do with us in this hour why it's needed and the pattern in the scripture has been always it was the consecration first before the miraculous can take place there was a consecration there was a burn offering there was something uh that was done that the people had to do they had to get in condition they had to get in line with God how many believe and know that one of the things that was revealed in the book of Acts it was revealed to Peter when he went to the Gentiles and that was that God is no respector of person that's a great Revelation that sometimes people think that just because they're the called out people just because they have received the message of a prophet just because they know certain things in the scriptures that denominations don't know and God has by his grace brought us out of that and has given us this word revealed sometimes we think that that makes us somewhat that God is obligated to us brother Adam said God is only obligated to his word amen and if you are part of that word you're going to line up with the that's why brother said the Dynamics to the mechanics said his husband and wife he said his head to the body I don't know if I'm going to be able to get to that we're going to try and it all depends reive because this is this is a serious hour and this consecration as we already made it clear Friday something that we read already in in the quotes and it's reported there where we see the prophet speaking of this consecration that is needed in his own lifeu even after he has seen God do many things even after he has given him the power to speak things into existence even after he has opened up the Seven Seals to him and has revealed to him amen the trumpets in The Sixth Seal even after he has opened up the whole scripture the whole revelation of the of the Bible after all of that he finds himself wanting a consecration brother brandom used many times a consecration [Music] service heu he called it in other times a time of consecration Church Hallelujah the Bible speaks of consecration in The Book of Leviticus the Levites were told by the word of the lordes the prophet amen that they were to consecrate themselves they had to consecrate themselves in order to come into the service of the Lord in the Tabernacle they had to consecrate that was a word that God gave to Moses so that those that would go into the temple to those that like us that are coming to service the service is for God the service that we're am is for God that's why brother said in church order amen am he says everything that you do in the Tabernacle don't do it like for me for brother amen it's for godu Hallelujah this is our service to God he has called us by his grace his word amen but when we lose sight and we don't know how to apply what God has given us apply it it amen to our lives and correctly amen because when we don't apply the word the message correctly listen to this you can be quoting scripture and you can be quoting messages but not applying it correctly remember some time ago we spoke on the law the laws of Revival how many remember that and we spoke about the days of Samuel amen and brother Ram said there's laws for Revival amen see you can do things without the law Lord has set laws in his word you can do it without following those things but it won't be the will of God it won't be the season you won't be the person and you not you're not Consulting the prophet see and therefore all going cause amen Amen brother said that has been the ccle of the church am that's the of Revival and death all through the church you see in the Bible same one time there serving God tremendous then they fall back down again and gods him come back again even this church right here the book of Acts said that's why that Ephesus Church was rebuked yes Christ amen amen go back to the first Works do the first thing amen you have lost your first love because they were at they were going in a certain speed they were going at a certain Pace with God amen amen being led by God God is in full control but then different interpretations different circumstances different ideas stop slow it down finally what they had no longer there yes Hallelujah but remember the days of Samuel just just to get into this just to get into this inspiration here when the Philistines had taken this power away from Israel remember El the man talks about the book of Samuel the message rejected King he talks about Samuel as a boyar before the the child could even know what that was God was already amen speaking hallelujah hallelujah he was born a prophet remember we went through that teaching showing how what time he was born Israel was in Wars when he would he begin to be brought up as a as a boy prophesy none of his prophecies brought allowed to fall to and then he prophesied as a child amen amen he prophesied as a older as older boy amen he saw the corruption that was happening with Eli's son amen we know what happened with one of their child with one of their children they had what his name was mentions that all the time but we just we just take it for granted and say ohab means the glory has Departed where does it where is that mentioned in the bible brother said this age of Le amen he said in the message know it not when God raises me up in the anointing and I look at the denominations I see the age of Le the nation but where is that where did he get that from where is the prophet where did he learn that in the book of Sam that's what one of the child's name was because that was the time the Bible says the candlesticks in the temple went out that's a type of the seven Church ages amen was passing away the glory departs from the Pentecostal Church from amen and the glory is with the prophet speaking the word we went through all of that amen in the laws of Revival but what I want to what I want you to see really quick is that in those days the Bible says that Israel tried to go against the philes and 3,000 died because the Lord was not with amen so when that happened the Bible says in the book of Samuel that the elders got together they weren't just anybody there were Elders of Israel they got together and they said what are we going to do this is why it doesn't matter what we know of the word how we app these these were Elders amen these were people that knew the word they knew the law of Moses these were the people that were in the land that Abraham had spoke of that Moses had brought them out of Egypt and Joshua had brought them into the land these people in the book of Samuel they weren't in Egypt they weren't in the desert no they were in the land Hallelujah they knew that God had sent a prophet they knew that God had brought them out of denominational systems they knew that the word had been open the Jordan had open to bring them into the land know that had already happened but they were in the land Amen in defeat in corruption fear deated and to try to bring that back oh we got to do something to try to revive that and get the people back in Victory got together said we got to do something and the Bible says that one of the elders said I got a revelation you remember that first Samuel 4 let us bring out the AR let us take you and surely brother just like today Brothers begin to get a lot of types and Revelations oh yeah yeah that's right the AR the word the message that's going to defeat the enemy but you got to know how to apply and you hear a lot of that today the message the message yes amen but the book ain't going to defeat the enemy the tape ain't going to defeat the enemy is what is contained in there applied in your heart by the holy spirit it's got to be anointed that's the difference when the word becomes spirit and life but because what happened the see there these are Elders they're supposed to know that Moses already said that can only be touched on the 10th day every year only once a year on the amen but here they are not caring what time of the year it is I don't care if it's to seventh month or not see they're not conscious of the season of the time they're trying to find [Music] ideas on how to do something without it being the will of God and they're using the the word they're using the message they're using the arc incre incre amen is that right because the Bible says that they took the ark and they ran towards the Philistines and the Bible says that they screamed and they shouted and they did a lot of emotion amen and theiles R then they said wait a minute let's go back and see what they're really about let's see if they really have what they're sh you know what the Bible says 30,000 di s times more wow seven times more amen amen but they they had the ark they had word they had emotions it shows is not just that amen you got to have the laws of God in order amen amen and for that they need under the spirit of God tell them what they remember where did he take them to to said first need toate first we need a burn offering you need to get right with god oh but the ark brother the AR is not me no I'm nothing the AR is what's going to do do it you and the word have to be in L amen Connection by the spirit of God Amen oh but but in the days of Joshua the AR is the one that open the Jordan AR is no doubt a lot of them Elders talk about amen but did it work no no because they didn't know the time they didn't know the season the prophet Thomas now watch and when Samuel brought them into condition but we're Israel we're the people of God God will never leave us that's true but if you're not in condition you're going to stay but you just don't know your amen and when he brought him into conditions Samuel SL theing rightall remember that the Thunder put the enemy on is that right amen hallelujah and then God told Samuel name this place this Stone am Hallelujah Victory Stone of see so this is why God is wanting to show us again and we can retain this amen and know that it's not just a one time thing no brother B says it's got to be constant not just one time not just some services that we had maybe a year ago but we preach on laws of Revival no this is constant yes so now we come to Acts chapter 4 Everybody following amen Acts chapter 4 is after Peter and John have seen the power of the spoken word and raised a lame man and set all hell against him after they have went to prison for a little bit brought before the council the Sanhedrin and the council has already threatened them and has charged them not to speak not to preach in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then the council let him go with that threat and when they let them go this is what happened verse3 Acts chapter 4 vers 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and they seeing all that in them is so notice when they're let loose and they they come to their own they come and tell the churchil they begin to tell the church brothers and sisters we have just seen the power of God with the spoken word we have seen the Fulfillment of the word The Works that I do shall e you also and greater than this shall you do going to the father amen we have seen that but after that happened the devil has set all his forces against us now there's a threat now there's a challenge of the enemy against us when they tell when they told the people that they they had a prayer meeting they lifted up their voice God they to pray verse 25 who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles the Heathen yes and the people of Israel were gathered together see see how they're praying how to pray brother brother said when you pray pray according to the word that's how they're praying in the book of brother mam said be specific in your prayers Jesus his son as his father not if the child ask the father for a fish bef and direct what you're asking people don't know how to pray they're not focused they're not zero on one thing look at all the prayers in the Bible time a of God or People Prayed it was for a they weren't praying for million things at one time no specific because you're talking to God you're in connection with God and you're asking him for a certain thing amen amen amen they're praying with the word seeing what David said in the second PSAL it's right there taking place for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatening oh my BR unto us thy servants amen that with all boldness yes they may speak word in other words we're not backing down enemy begins to attack and begins to do things against us that's not the time that's not the time to get weaker that's not the time to get discouraged that's not the time to say oh Devil's hallelujah it's not the time to do that it's the time to pray like this by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke the word of the Lord with B Hallelujah and the multitude of them that believe were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that ought the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things amen how we want to see are we listen are we in the are we in the channel are we seeing what God is doing here why he put that in our heart Friday if we were on the series of the book of Acts why did all of a sudden he bring consecration now as I in my prayer he's wanting to show us connection why he has brought to our attention Friday cons if we're on the book of am Acts chapter 4 is the church that has already received the Holy Spirit it's the church that has already seen God in his power of the spoken word they're not praying for it to happen no they've already seen it amen and if you know but we have testified and if you have seen that in your own life then you know that those things have happened amen but the spirit is trying to show us something amen just because we have seen let's not presume Amen to advance without author Amen Let Us con and brother B shows us that these right here it's Peter John and it's the church has already received the spirit on the day you see the problem is that we think that we can be so filled with the spirit that's what consecration istion is rededication consecration is a refilling of the Holy ghid how we touch that there a refilling means that you've already been filled once and then you get a refill Amen brother mam said the dams is Dynamics is not the fing you need the feeling to know the truth to know the will of God to know the word to see his word manifest in sence and wonders and then after that amen get a refilling to stay in that to move you and Advance people get stuck people get stagnant yes amen there's no advantage we're still facing the same Temptations the samees the devil keeps beating them up they can't pass that test there's no Dynamics there's no prevailing power to advance amen not that you're lost it's not that you're you know going to go to hell but you're just stuck says take you see I believe that we have stressed so much we have put much emphasis and show by the scriptures on the Greater Works and proven that brother Adam said Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts right they can get a true Revelation the spirit of the Antichrist what it is and how it works within the framewor of the church will be in by the spirit of God they can Will yes amen but what the prophet said that need the prevailing power to overcome am hallelujah hallelujah and brother said this is what I was going to say because in that same quote says and that she may know that she can do the greater work and I believe we've proven that so much by the message of theot the scures that that is for us but the thing is brother said this is what the prophet said if you want to do the Greater Works the prophet said let me see the Lesser works first Hallelujah want do the Greater Works let me see the Lesser works first am what are the less Works consecration what are the Lesser words be right with God what the work love your brother what the work amen oh I'm going to do the greater work but I can't love my brother you ain't going nowhere yes you're going to stay stuck and stag we can't overcome and these little things and we plan to overcome the squeeze comes on see what I'm saying we can overcome little testings amen little trials and differences amen amen amen and we plan to overcome in the squeeze or somehow magically in the squeeze we're going to be able to overcome that being able to overcome this it doesn't work so amen amen amen so the spirit of God like I said Friday I pray to God and I have prayed to God that you take it in the right and correct spirit and that you know that it's the spirit of God exhorting us to see that we need all of us a consecration I read the quotes Friday brother said I need it and the church needs amen and then studying this before Friday I didn't even know what I was going to speak amen that same day I told you on Friday that came today and from Friday to today the spirit has shown us and is showing us how this is in connection and why is bringing this to our F understand amen now I just felt something now to open up see that's like I said at the beginning it all depends on how we receive it if we know that he is in control now watch we we read already those books hu but we want to read here in the message why Christ speak see Friday we read why Christ speak but from 1963 July and in that evening he pre TBL brother said God is wanting to bring this third Pooler but I need toate hallelujah hallelujah said that in 63 why Christ speak and he said in Humble but now watch this this is powerful this is the spirit here connecting why Christ speak 59 brother bam is in clarsville Indiana and and he's going to preach there this message and he says I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister he's calling Bram Tabernacle big sister to the church where he Church see one thing that the big sister needs the Tabernacle needs there at our church the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost he says that's right everyone to go down to the altar pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost and the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need and then he says not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal needs a refilling like David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation he had not lost his salvation but the joy of when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewh because it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said taste the Lord and see that he's good it tastes like Honey in the Rock I'm so glad that I tasted that the Lord is good and I love honey but I never taste it anything like that that's the best that I knowall and brother says now we're going to hurry right into the service and see if we can let the church out early they can go to their places of work tomorrow and their homes and now we are anticipating listen I want to show you how God was dealing with the prophet in this rededication and this Consecration

so the next day Monday he comes to the platform and he says tonight being Monday night I tell you I didn't expect 130 these people to be here I didn't think there would be over a couple hundred or three usually on Monday nights in the East well the meetings are pretty slow but I believe there's something here tonight there's more here tonight than there was yesterday afternoon and I said yesterday afternoon that tonight I wanted a night that I would like to call it we're going to be dealing with the issue of my new ministry M amen amen amen he told the people over here in his church amen we need a refilling we need because God is fixing to do something amen amen then he he comes over there and he tells them the same thing this new ministry but I want to call it a consecration night I would like to just get inside and let you know a little bit about the dealings of the holy spirit in my own life and I hope that in doing so it will let you prosper and get closer to God yourself the prophet is going to share his experiences us of how God is dealing with to help us and get closer to God speaking of a Divine gift that is now in the Mak coming to the church amen he says that I'm sure all of us are interested in anything that God is going to do amen and the promises of God being fulfilled and I've only told it once to my own Tabernacle in Indiana inana he says tonight I was going to try to tell you what happened in the last few news it's new it's fresh and I'll that it will help you I thought starting tonight beginning this week's meeting it will help you to pray for me and pray for the church that we all might in into this great thing that God's already he says it will it will be hard on myself of but it will be a good thing for the church that's what I'm interested in God's people something to help them believe on God take on a new new hold and it'll be a great thing for the sick too dear Lord now he's praying watch this we're grateful to the for the privilege of knowing as a personal pass from Death life and that the spirit of Christ dwells in us around us among us and we are his people that called by his name he says bless my ministering brother who are sitting here listening supporting My Prayer by every effort that they can bless these brother we pray that you'll just give them unction and Power and the desire their hearts may be fulfilled in their lives others who are out in the audience it be the same with them Father forgive us all of our shortcoming we have many of those and we pray that you'll take your word now and bless it to our heart and I would ask the Lord listen to this may it not be thought by the people because that I am referring to an experience that you have given to me telling the truth that it might not be thought that it was meant personally but that you are fixing to do for your people may all rejoice and all believe and all benefit by in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that was at the beginning of that message and he said some things in between I'm gonna read right now but this is what he said at the end of the message I feel that one great thing is necessary the Holy Spirit is speaking to me now I believe we ought to have a night this should be a where we should consecrate ourselves am don't you think so are you ready Church of God are you ready for such a move have you buried every sin in the blood of Jesus Christ have you confessed all your wrongs oh Ministers of the Gospel my precious Brothers I tell you the truth so help me God knows that's the truth we're just shadowing something near at hand now I don't know just where or when but I told you exactly God's truth God knows that's truth the spirit is here now healing let's get our souls healed tonight let's get ourselves fixed in condition I told Billy not to give out any prayer cards tonight I didn't want a prayer line I want a consecration I want this church to draw so close to God I wanted to get so close to God until we might be in this medum that it will break forth through this church here I'm telling you when that takes place the coming of the Lord is at hand the enemy with her Atomic is coming in like a flood but the spirit of God is raising a standard against amen don't you fear church I know you got a lot of Scruples among you got a lot of upsets and downs sets everything else but still you are the Church of the Living God by the grace of God you are no matter what you've done how you done God forgive you of your sins he wants a consecration look down upon Israel and said they have done dirty things but he failed to see that there was the Church of the Living God there was the smitten Rock and the brass serpent before them and atonement laying there for them and every one of you that's been baptized with the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sins the spirit of the Lord is here now that's in the name of the Lord I speak if anybody don't believe it speak to God about your sickness find out just see if it's the truth he says Lord God is in the midst of his people let us all rise to our feet this is the hour of [Applause] divine if you can believe the Lord God requires requires a consecration he cannot break forth upon us until we've been so surrendered to his will to his power he cannot break forth until our hearts are so cleansed from sin and things of the world until the Holy Ghost can ride in upon us hallelujah and so surround us as he has right now how do I know these things it's not me it's him that speaks I've told the truth about it listen there is something

Amen to speak about this power that is coming and it's going to do great things this new ministry I read the quote at the beginning he said Lord don't let the people think that because I'm speaking of personal experiences that they might think this is for me he said this is for the church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and now I didn't know this till last night amen I said Lord you're leading us on book of Acts do you want me to continue to speak on consecration amen am and I begin to follow the quotes just like I have told you today I know it's been long I know it's a lot of explanation but I want you to see the spirit of the Lord to show us watch this and reading these things and how in 59 he says we need consecrate tacle Consecration and then he says pray for me I'm going to the West Coast so what did I do I followed him those meeting last night I followed him I want to see what he's speaking and then and then he's in the west coast and he preaches a prophet like Moses he preaches amen uh the seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy and then he preaches who is this and then he announces who is this I read it tomorrow night I want to speak about my new ministry and then Monday night he says I said so Monday's service is speak to this mountain 1959 he says tonight to speak about my new ministry is a night of not just for me church for the body of and I begin to follow him and what he said in that message and then he at the end he's praying this and he says oh Lord send your power send it upon us not for our will for the glory of God and he says the heathens are raging they imagine vain things but let the Holy Ghost sh this place again where we're assembled together telling of the stories of the power of the Lord he is saying the same thing that Peter and John they had seen the spoken word is that right did he say silver and gold i i to the he didn't have to cry and pray all night SP and it was done when they had seen that and the enemy raging came up and begin to fight against this and they threatened him amen when they were let loose that's what we read 23 and when they and being let go they went to their own brother says look they went when the council left them go where did they go their own said they didn't go back to the council they didn't go back to the they didn't go back to nowhere else they went back to their own to tell them this is what the devil is you have seen his power but the devil doesn't like amen brothers and sisters not I'm not saying this to boast or to brag I want you to see the spirit of God is trying to lead us into a further advanc Hallelujah because we have already seen we have emphasized on the greater work and we have seen some of those works I believe we need more consecration brother said in perfect faith we we are seeing Apostolic says but we want to see more of it that it will flow in us here Among Us that it can flow out to that's what the prophet now when we follow the footsteps of the Prophet we see that what he is preaching is not just preaching a sermon no it's the spirit directing him in experiences and and he's finding his experience in the Bible amen that's why he's praying Lord the people are raging the heathens are raging they imagine M things but let the Holy Ghost shake this place again where we are a symbol telling the stories that's what he was doing in that message speak to this mountain he said he told the story about the squirels he told the story about he told the story amen amen in the night of consecration sister last meeting we had in Mexico by the grace of God and for his glory we seen and I testified of that in the church amen and the brothers in Mexico can testify of that this is being recorded I would be a bluff and a liar just to say things that weren't true I'm not saying it to make me greater to try to say I'm good one no I'm saying this is the spirit telling us we need more con amen hallelujah but the spirit amen fell in that meeting that last meting Hallelujah all of the people felt it not just me not just the ministers all of the people that were in those meetings they all began to they all felt something sweep over it when when the Holy Spirit had silver but what I have the message of the I give unto thee amen thatu we're in the book of that this is the holy spirit directing us right here inorder because that happened in Acts two callist to the mage conference he said they're not praying to be filled with the Holy Ghost already full they're not praying for salvation you see what I'm saying this is as brothers and sisters this is as as we to understand that we each one of us has a part am and each one of us you are part inting ourselves Hallelujah and consecrating ourselves takes a lot takes time it takes courage it takes humbleness part of consecration is getting right with you brothers and S part of consecration amen is get right Hallelujah that's why I said lesser things open the Amen in the right hallelu but watch what the prophet says here so he prays exactly like Acts chapter 4 in the consecration service here he says let the rushing Mighty Wind sweep through every heart shake this place burn out all sin all iniquity all all fears and may every person become a consecrated Saint unto thee us Lord may we go from here with boldness this is what they pray that we go with a deep settled peace in our heart with a real faith that will shake Mountain because his message for the consecration is Mark 112 if you speak to this and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you asked will come to pass you can have what you said that's what he's dealing with in that message the ministry the power of the word amen something that Satan can something that only the seed of God the Bride of God the elected of God the chosen predestin Hallelujah anointed and commission of God to prophesy again he saysed you see how see how it connects now acts now I know why now you know why I didn't know why Friday I didn't know why I just said I told you the Lord wants me to speak on consecration here it goes amen amen amen but we're in the book of Acts brother now we see it this is consecration it's a refilling they have already been filled in that's chapter two and that filling that was in them is what made them speak because that wasn't Peter that was the Holy Ghost that they Reed in the upper room that spoke that wasn't the prophet that spoke the squs into existence that was the Holy ghoster and the prophet after that experience of speaking of the Holy Ghost in them they feel I need more you see what I'm saying not because they're in sin because they feel they lost oh I'm going to hell because the spirit is calling us amen and this is what I truly believe the whole service begin after he tells the stories praise again consecration we consecrate ourselves this is still the same message bless your ministers Lord we pray Lord believe that that what you get would you ask for that's your word Lord we believe it and our prayers thank you Lord for they're all true promises are Y and amen to each one speak through us use us For Your Glory we consecrate ourselves to thee we dedicate ourselves I dedicate myself a new in this pulpit Lord God me if there's any evil in me take it away Lord if there's anything that you could use me for to help your church your people to further be a better Ministry be a better understanding of God Here I Am Lord speak your servant will hear I'll answer Lord just speak and I'll do anything you say Lord God may I found may I may I have favor in your side not for self Glory you've tried me in the fires but for the help of your church for for the sake of your people that is scattered may they become together as one unit as one person and may we stand in the power of the Resurrection may you pour out your spirit and your gifts upon your church that will be an outstanding thing to the world that will cause all men to know what they had left behind we give these prayers to you for answer believing that you'll do it in the name of your son Jesus amen and he's still speaking believe it in your heart I believe God listen I believe that God is going to do a great thing Among Us it's already started and if it started like this what will it be after it goes a little while amen blessed be the name of the Lord now this is what he prophesied in the message speak to this mountain in that night of consecration when he was speaking of this third pool anoint that came over him he said that power that fell on me in har house is going to fall upon the whole church I know a lot of people in the message don't believe that but I believe am watch what he says I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that is going to shake the whole world that's the first time that has ever been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled amen he says oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen that that anointing will strike the whole church of the living and she will rise to her like a mighty marching on the sick will be healed by a word the will see the death will hear they will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the church we're in the process of it now I believe it's coming soon to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of the Living God and it's going to start a reviv that will shake the world I believe it the Lord God Of Heaven who made heavens and earth Serv I am I stand here now before you in the name of Jesus Christ those words are true that service oftion Hallelujah that anointing it's going to St you it's going to me Hallelujah raise us to our feet as will be Invincible Army brother it's necessary the holy spirit is speaking this to me he said coming from in this message he said coming from home he says from Jeffersonville says I've hardly gotten any sleep amenallah thinking about this hallelujah amen hallelujah and after speak to this mountain and he preaches more messages that week comes back chur and what he told him before leaving amen is what he preached over there and when he comes back he preaches what is the Holy Ghost preaches what is the Holy Ghost given he preaches what in the message what is the Holy Ghost to this little Tabernacle seeing that I believe it's one of the finest people that I believe that's on the earth that goes to this tabernac I never said all the finest people said some of the finest but as day by day entering back from the meeting to meeting I see a great need in this time a great need in it and that's for a filling or you see Hallelujah see I had heard these messages I had studied these messages before but I had never amen and how God laying this strong in the heart of the Prophet but the consecration is with the vision in mind the consecration is with an expectation it's not just consecrating because a lot of people do that a lot of religious people do but they're consecrating themselves for something that's not scal they're consecrating themselves for some denomination for some Creed for some Dogma for some religion amen and they consecrate and it's the work of theil amen amen amen but the prophet is talking about this consecration with the vision and mind with the word in mind with prophecy amen amen is that right am now watch he says I see a great need for a cons a deeper life amen a closer walk with am he's not saying you're not walking with God he's not amen but he says we need a deeper close I have promised them to do this to have this messages for them we're glad to bring you in fellowship with us we're glad to bring you into this Fellowship I have something message amen I'm finish you he says but I have completely surrendered every will everything that I know to the Lord amen the other night says my wife and iay talking to the Lord the Little Foot in our front room two openes we consecrated ourselves a new just a few nights back from s Jose for a complete service we would surrender our own Wills every negative thought to serve he says I trust that that's been your attitude too that you've done the same thing then we're coming tonight upon Holy Ground among a people who's been praying fasting making restitutions getting ready to receive something from God and I know that he that will come hungry will not go away willu amen preaches the Holy Ghost series after still speak it on amen he says after making my own contion after having the church do so also if God blessed us the way he has in the last few meetings with the little concert what will he do if we keep it up see just keep it up love one another amen see the lovely Spirit moving around don't you listen to one foul thing Hallelujah that the devil's got to say if the devil shows you something tells you some evil thing about one of the members of the body of Christ don't you believe for as soon as you believe it you your brother continues on stand to your feet other meetings he continues to talk about the church needs consecration amen amen goes into 61 60612 he's still talking perodic and he said God has given the issue for the church to go back into prayer life amen back to back to a spot where we consecrate ourselves get back to when we we we consecrate ourselves away from the things of the world away from our little petty differences because if not brother say amen believe that amen amen hallelujah he says in the message absolute let us consecrate ourselves to this absolute Hallelujah consecrate yourself to the absolute I think I'd like to have a consecration call amen instead of having an altar call this morning I think I'd like to have a consecration call let's consecrate ourselves to this abute you believe the word of God God's absolute you believe he's the same yesterday today and forever amen let us consecrate our let us raise to our feet now and consecrate Our Lives ministers consecrate your lives Church consecrate your lives let us stand to our feet and consecrate Our Lives I want to consecrate mine also tying myself aresh Hallelujah checking my make sure my KN is tied right I'm checking my absolute Lord if there is anything in me besides Thy word take it out I know nothing else but you I want to know nothing else but you Hallelujah he says in the resurrection message what we need today is another refilling another like theallu Hallelujah some of you have tried to test an experience or trust in it that you had 10 years ago you need one today today is the day of a refilling listen to this the disciples for three or four days after that they received the Holy Ghost they went back and got in one Accord and began to pray until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sting that's what we needu hallelujah hallelujah in the message what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ hallelujah hallelujah he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked oh glory in a small measure while the head Stone is coming down to unite with the body when the head and the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen will rise her exactly like even the dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight into the sky the is the holy am let us bow our heads amen do you see now grace of God by the help of his Spirit can we see it brothers and sister amen amen the reason why he has brought this conentration to our attention we are in the book of Acts Acts chapter 4 showing us that they prayed according to the psalm of David Psalm chapter hallelujah hallelujah prayed according to the word amen amen under the channel of inspiration for the season for the time that they were and the challenge that they were facing and that was the time of a consecration that was a time of a rededication that was a time for refilling the Dynamics to the mechanic when we have worked in a measure but when the Dynamics come to the mechanics there will be a full power that will raise the bride up that's why he says what you seen temporary it power brothers and sisters that promise is a prophecy for you in this believe it with all our hearts let us see the spirit of the composer and what Spirit he was giving and what channel of inspiration he was giving amen how the Holy Spirit was directing leading him on this consecration with the vision in mind with the prophecy in mind with the word in mind Ministry of this great power great anointing of his great dyamics that's going to lift us out in this Rapture brothers and sisters this is a reality we we cannot ignore this this is a truth in the word and if you are [Music] sincere if you are sinere you know why yes the Holy Ghost has led us to speak

needed a consecration if we claim be that church if we claim be that people we must recognize also that we too to need cons a rededication a refill we have seen it in a [Music] measure seen these great things but it's our time do you truly believe that brother and sister amen you believe this is the holy spirit Hallelujah speaking to our hearts speaking to my heart or do you see this as brother Diego just preaching a Ser sister [Music] let us hear the spirit says yes let us see what he's pointing us to as he as he showed it to us through the word as he showed it to us through the message [Music] that should give you fath brother Ram said you cannot place your faith in something that is not word but he does it that way this is the holy spirit leading us into a deeper walk a
