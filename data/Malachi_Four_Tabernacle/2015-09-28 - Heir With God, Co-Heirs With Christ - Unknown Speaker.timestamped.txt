[1:41] you we're by the holy
[1:44] spirit said we're led by the
[1:49] word the holy spirit is not something
[1:53] different the word the Holy Spirit wrote
[1:57] the
[1:58] word spirit is the
[2:01] word in spirit form Jesus said my word
[2:07] is spirit and it is amen that's why
[2:11] brother told us if we have the Holy
[2:14] Ghost in
[2:16] us that Holy Ghost cannot
[2:20] deny one word that's in his word he
[2:25] wrote the word many times brother had to
[2:29] correct the
[2:33] because they were used to only being
[2:37] led by what they
[2:40] felt as to say I feel the anointing of
[2:45] God and the ano of God tell me to do
[2:48] this and brother said that's
[2:51] okay that's fine but always
[2:56] check what you are feeling to do if it's
[3:00] in the word because if it ain't and it's
[3:04] contrary to the word then I don't care
[3:07] what you feel I don't care what you do
[3:11] it's not the holy
[3:14] spirit amen that's why it's the word
[3:19] that's above all other
[3:23] things that's the only thing that Satan

[8:00] we're going to begin reading from verse
[8:04] one and he began to speak unto them by
[8:12] para now this is
[8:16] Jesus at the end of his
[8:19] ministry he is about to go to the
[8:22] Cross he has come to
[8:26] Jerusalem for the last passover
[8:31] he has come to the end of his time in a
[8:35] human
[8:39] body
[8:40] on and for his last
[8:45] time he has come to City of
[8:50] Jerusalem because here is where they he
[8:56] knows he told his dis
[9:00] that they were to take
[9:02] him he was going to be taken to the Man
[9:05] Hands of sinful
[9:08] men he was going to be offered
[9:11] up for a
[9:14] sacrifice
[9:16] for is that right and we see
[9:21] that he begines to speak this
[9:27] Parable and there's many that are
[9:29] hearing
[9:31] him and this is the reason why he is
[9:34] giving the
[9:36] bar remember that every time that Jesus
[9:39] would speak a
[9:42] parable there was a
[9:45] mystery behind this
[9:48] Parable there was a
[9:50] significance of what he was
[9:53] saying every little detail in the
[9:57] parable had a meaning
[10:00] it was perfect this was a parable was an
[10:03] example a story a
[10:08] picture of something really that was
[10:11] speaking of a greater
[10:16] picture speaking of something of an
[10:19] eternal
[10:21] value something in the mind of God a
[10:26] plan amen that he begin to speak and
[10:30] unfold amen the whole the whole chapter
[10:34] of Matthew 13 is all
[10:40] Parables and all is a
[10:43] mystery of this last day is all
[10:47] revealing the plan of
[10:49] God and Jesus here begins to speak this
[10:54] Parable and he says a certain man
[10:57] planted a Vineyard and set a hedge about
[11:01] and dig a place for the wine fat and
[11:05] built the Tower and let it out to
[11:08] husband men and went into a far
[11:23] country brother he he he
[11:26] said a whole lot in one little verse
[11:32] but many times without
[11:35] understanding without
[11:37] ration we cannot just catch entirely
[11:42] what he's
[11:44] saying but when you look at it he's
[11:49] speaking of one that planted a
[11:53] Vineyard he set a hedge of protection
[11:57] round about it
[12:01] then he begins to show how little by
[12:07] little he began to build this
[12:11] vineard he began to edify this
[12:16] Vine he began to uh build it and make it
[12:21] a a full complete
[12:25] V and then he said he
[12:29] gave it into the hands of
[12:33] husbandmen and he went
[12:37] away
[12:41] understand Jesus in that first
[12:44] verse has just spoke of 4,000
[12:52] years hallelujah hallelujah at the
[12:55] season he sent the husband men a
[13:00] that he might receive from the husband
[13:03] of the fruit of the
[13:10] vineyard they C him and beat
[13:13] him and Sh him
[13:22] away he sent unto them another
[13:25] servant and at him they cast stones and
[13:28] wounded him in the head and send him
[13:30] away as
[13:32] shamefully hand and handled shamefully
[13:42] handled he
[13:44] another and they killed and many others
[13:48] beating some and killing
[13:58] some
[14:00] having yet therefore one
[14:03] son his well
[14:06] beloved he sent him also last last mhm
[14:12] unto
[14:13] them saying them they will reverence my
[14:28] son
[14:32] they will reverence my
[14:36] son but those husband men said among
[14:41] themselves this is the
[14:44] air
[14:45] come let us kill
[14:48] you and inheritance shall be
[14:58] ours
[15:00] and they took
[15:03] him and killed him and cast him out of
[15:13] the oh they cast him
[15:22] out what shall therefore the Lord of The
[15:25] Vineyard
[15:26] do he will come and destroy the
[15:29] husbandman and will give the vineyard
[15:32] unto
[15:42] others have you not read the
[15:45] scripture the St which the builders
[15:48] rejected is become the head of the
[15:57] corner
[16:05] this was the Lord's
[16:07] doing that is marvelous in our
[16:14] eyes hallelujah hallelujah and they
[16:17] sought to lay hold on him but feared the
[16:20] people for they know they knew that he
[16:23] had
[16:24] spoken the parable against
[16:27] them and they left him and went their
[16:41] way they
[16:45] understood exactly what he was
[16:48] talking he was desing just by speaking
[16:52] this
[16:55] terrible not saying it directly
[16:59] but just speaking a little
[17:02] Parable just saying this little story
[17:06] here but he knew what was in their
[17:10] hearts they had
[17:14] conspired they had
[17:17] a
[17:22] to Hallelujah so in verse in verse
[17:27] S is where
[17:29] we take our context from
[17:34] today the
[17:36] husbandman cuz in verse
[17:39] six he sent his
[17:43] sonov in verse
[17:45] seven the husband and
[17:49] said this is the
[17:55] air hallelujah hallelujah remember our
[17:58] scripture Romans
[18:03] 8 when they saw him they said this is
[18:10] the
[18:13] come let us
[18:16] kill and The
[18:19] Inheritance shall be
[18:22] ours oh
[18:25] my
[18:27] Hallelujah
[18:31] sisters when you
[18:34] look at what Jesus is speaking in this
[18:38] Parable from verse
[18:41] two he begins to
[18:45] unfold how that once it was given into
[18:48] the hands of the
[18:53] husband
[18:54] that in different
[18:57] seasons in different
[19:00] times in times
[19:02] p and in many
[19:05] seasons he spoke to the
[19:09] father in The
[19:12] Prophet but at
[19:17] lastu
[19:20] Hallelujah is that and what is he
[19:24] speaking of Hallelujah Hallelujah this
[19:28] is
[19:29] this really spoke to
[19:32] me and I
[19:36] feel the Holy
[19:38] Spirit as we have spoke about
[19:42] it I'm sure that the sons of
[19:46] God and the daughters of
[19:48] God know what I'm talking
[19:52] about when we
[19:55] feel that the the thing is coming
[20:00] closer and closer remember what we spoke
[20:03] last
[20:05] Sunday about the
[20:07] de amen how God gave him a certain
[20:14] nature is that right and that nature is
[20:18] able to
[20:19] deserve when something is getting
[20:22] close he can hear the sound he can
[20:26] smell when the hunters
[20:29] are getting
[20:30] close is that right there's something
[20:34] that God put in
[20:36] him amen that it begins to
[20:39] activate greater and greater the
[20:43] closer amen that this is coming to him
[20:47] and that's why David said amen my
[20:51] soul amen first after the Living
[20:55] God Amen as the as the a deer planted
[21:00] for the water
[21:02] Brooks so my soul curs after the Living
[21:07] God hallelujah hallelujah and we see
[21:10] that this same nature is in the body of
[21:13] Jesus
[21:16] Christ if we are sons of God we are led
[21:20] by the spirit of
[21:23] God said inside of every Son of God
[21:29] that has received the Holy
[21:31] Spirit there is a portion of
[21:36] discernment because the holy
[21:38] spirit is the one that
[21:41] discern not you the holy
[21:44] spirit amen hallelujah so when we
[21:48] see
[21:50] that this same thing amen it's coming
[21:54] back
[21:55] again amen there is a
[21:59] spiracy there is
[22:02] a to
[22:04] destroy the
[22:06] seed and thees of God in the last
[22:12] days and that is Satan's
[22:16] plan since
[22:19] heavenu he is always
[22:22] s to to
[22:25] destroy amen God's seed
[22:29] so that he can become
[22:33] a where there's no more
[22:35] seed amen remember what Abraham
[22:39] said when God promised him a
[22:41] son and he said that that son would be
[22:45] the he of all
[22:48] thingsam said that son is
[22:53] Jesus not the son of his
[22:56] flesh but the son of his his
[22:59] faith amen the son of his faith was
[23:04] Jesus Christ the son of his flesh was
[23:08] ISAC amenu then we see that Abraham told
[23:14] God Amen you have promised me a son and
[23:18] that he is my
[23:19] he amen but I have no
[23:23] children and only El eer of

[23:33] to all things in other words there is no
[23:37] seed to take the
[23:40] inheritance The Inheritance goes to
[23:42] someone

[23:47] Satan has done from the beginning he has
[23:52] wanted to destroy the
[23:56] sea he has wanted to destroy destroy the
[24:00] seed because he knows if he can
[24:04] eliminate the seed
[24:08] completely he will
[24:12] be and what Jesus is speaking
[24:16] here he is
[24:18] showing that it's the

[45:57] [Music]
[46:01] to in the last
[46:06] days this brother
[46:08] and if you can catch
[46:14] this let me say this the very
[46:19] reason that this persecution has
[46:22] come the very
[46:25] reason that this conspiracy is
[46:29] on that this is
[46:31] on amen amen the very
[46:35] reason that this evil serpent
[46:40] SE this Children of the devil are
[46:44] conspiring against this last
[46:48] day amen just like those evil
[46:53] spirits in the days of
[46:55] Jesus knew that he was the
[47:00] son and that the son had
[47:03] arrived and that he
[47:05] was so the same evil
[47:09] spirit knowing this last
[47:12] day
[47:18] son amen he was
[47:21] there Amen in all the
[47:24] services of the prophet
[47:27] he was there at the preaching of the
[47:30] seals don't think he

[47:37] knows what is
[47:40] come
[47:42] amen you don't think he
[47:44] know you don't think he
[47:47] knows oh who is this guy people he SM s
[47:55] and
[47:58] I
[48:07] got
[48:09] this and that's the very
[48:14] reason since those
[48:17] years
[48:20] am that roal Council of

[48:42] United States in
[48:43] church and they
[48:45] persecuted and they killed 68
[48:49] million

[49:16] the I better kill
[49:19] this I better
[49:23] kill so I can
[49:25] become
[49:28] and that's the
[49:30] reason is because his evil
[49:34] spirit Satan himself
[49:38] acknowledges that
[49:40] the have
[49:44] come
[49:46] infection amen hallelujah the
[49:50] air hallelujah hallelujah and they
[49:54] ploted a persecution
[49:57] against the word in its
[49:59] fullness to kill him and so it is with

[1:51:00] live what he says I'm going to take the
[1:51:04] word of
[1:51:06] God and I'm going toide every
[1:51:09] denomination there
[1:51:12] is if I could only get the people to
[1:51:15] realize
[1:51:17] that you'll see something spontaneous
[1:51:21] happen
[1:51:24] that it will shape the whole
[1:51:28] country and I I'm going to take the word
[1:51:31] of
[1:51:32] God and guide every denomination there
[1:51:36] is every man on the face of the
[1:51:39] Earth that's guilty of the blood of
[1:51:41] Jesus
[1:51:43] Christ yes oh
[1:51:46] sers make fun of him this is the
[1:51:49] reproach for the cause of the words they
[1:51:52] reproached
[1:51:54] him he stayed right with him oh watch
[1:51:58] what he did he was the son of God he
[1:52:02] suffered death in order to put sin to
[1:52:07] death that's the only way why it could
[1:52:10] be he could be put to
[1:52:12] death and he did this and stood
[1:52:16] it CU all the rest of them did because
[1:52:20] all of them back
[1:52:21] there amure word of God because Jesus
[1:52:25] said so the word of the Lord came to the
[1:52:29] prophets which one of them he said that
[1:52:32] your father's organized
[1:52:36] religion didn't stwn and put to
[1:52:39] death which one of them received the
[1:52:43] prophets then you buil a
[1:52:45] tomb after they were
[1:52:48] gone and he said you're guilty of
[1:52:50] putting them in there
[1:52:53] then he gave them the
[1:52:55] parable about the
[1:52:57] vineyard she let
[1:53:03] out the vineyard
[1:53:06] out and the servants come and they
[1:53:10] ministered and they mistreated
[1:53:12] them then finally said now will kill the
[1:53:17] son because he's a
[1:53:20] he see all they got
[1:53:23] angry when they seen that but he had to
[1:53:26] stand the
[1:53:28] reproach and here he has
[1:53:32] himself bound led up to death in order
[1:53:36] to be put to death to bring back eternal
[1:53:41] life glory to God how I love him bring
[1:53:45] back eternal life and raise up every Son
[1:53:48] of God down Through the Ages stood with
[1:53:53] that word and took the
[1:53:55] reproach that's right in the days of
[1:53:59] Noah in the days of Moses they sent the
[1:54:03] prophets to them what did they do they
[1:54:06] stoned them put them the death saw the
[1:54:11] pieces they burned them any way to get
[1:54:14] rid of
[1:54:15] them they got them off of their
[1:54:18] hands and Jesus T the very f
[1:54:25] Parable he brought a parable and he said
[1:54:29] there was a man a great man and had he
[1:54:33] had a Vineyard and put dressers in
[1:54:36] it and he sent a servant and they killed
[1:54:40] him and he sent another servant and they
[1:54:43] killed him said finally said I'll send
[1:54:46] my
[1:54:47] son and they'll regard him and the
[1:54:51] dressers of the V
[1:54:53] this is the
[1:54:55] a let's kill him that was God's son that
[1:54:59] he s he sent the prophets sending his
[1:55:03] word the word of God
[1:55:06] remember every falling
[1:55:12] generation there is only one thing that
[1:55:15] can bre this
[1:55:17] world together that's the word of God
[1:55:21] Andes Jesus here is saying man has
[1:55:25] always
[1:55:26] tried to make
[1:55:29] excuses no it may be firmly proven to
[1:55:33] him you see if you
[1:55:36] read Matthew
[1:55:39] 22 you find the excuses were
[1:55:42] made is
[1:55:44] connected to the parable of Matthew
[1:55:49] 21 it's the same parable
[1:55:52] 12 and Matthew 21 is the same Parable
[1:55:58] and in connection with that
[1:55:59] Parable is the parable of the great
[1:56:03] feast amen amen amen watch the prophet
[1:56:07] connecting it here it went back into all
[1:56:11] ages went back into the age and said a
[1:56:15] man bat
[1:56:16] them and he had
[1:56:21] a amen and he had a
[1:56:25] vard see he's connecting both
[1:56:28] scenes he's connecting both
[1:56:31] ter he had vineard and he them to
[1:56:35] come
[1:56:37] see and we find that
[1:56:40] Parable how he send servants to collect
[1:56:43] from
[1:56:45] thisor first servant
[1:56:47] come what they do they run him off the
[1:56:51] next one they Stone him they run a
[1:56:55] servant after
[1:56:57] servant the CR men the king sent finally
[1:57:01] his
[1:57:02] son and when his son came we find out
[1:57:06] they said this
[1:57:09] an we kill him then we'll have all
[1:57:16] things will have
[1:57:21] all is your life worthy of the
[1:57:27] Gospel this is the air will kill
[1:57:31] him then we'll have all
[1:57:36] things why because Son of
[1:57:40] God is to all
[1:57:45] things will be he of all things then
[1:57:48] Jesus said to him the king sent forth in
[1:57:52] slew those
[1:57:56] murderers and burn their
[1:57:58] cities that's not included in in Mark
[1:58:02] 12 but it's included in Matthew
[1:58:07] 21 amen hallelujah we probably won't
[1:58:10] have time to get into
[1:58:11] it but
[1:58:14] here
[1:58:15] amen
[1:58:21] 23 he's speaking the same
[1:58:27] Parable head around wi built a
[1:58:34] tower put it in the hands of of the Ser
[1:58:37] of the
[1:58:38] husband he sent a Ser kill him s another
[1:58:40] one all this
[1:58:42] right verse
[1:58:44] 37 but last of all he sent unto them his
[1:58:48] son saying they will leverage my
[1:58:51] son
[1:58:53] but when the husband men saw the son
[1:58:55] they said among themselves say the air
[1:58:57] come let us kill let us kill him and let
[1:59:00] on his
[1:59:10] inance and they caught him and cast him
[1:59:13] out of the vard and slew
[1:59:16] him when the Lord therefore of the
[1:59:19] vineyard cometh what will he do unto the
[1:59:21] old husband man
[1:59:26] they sayto him he will miserably destroy
[1:59:28] those wicked men and let us let out his
[1:59:31] Vineyard unto other husband men which
[1:59:33] shall render him the fruits in their
[1:59:47] season Jesus said unto them did you
[1:59:50] never read in the scriptures

[2:07:23] together Hallelujah not different it's
[2:07:26] the same
[2:07:30] thing Jesus said they Stone and killed
[2:07:34] the
[2:07:35] prophets that was sent to them by making
[2:07:41] excuses now the excuses they
[2:07:44] made in each
[2:07:46] day we find in the days of Jesus and he
[2:07:52] didn't affiliate with any of
[2:07:56] them they said when when did this man
[2:07:59] get his
[2:08:01] learning he come from it's not Mr
[2:08:04] Carpenter son isn't his mother called
[2:08:07] Mary isn't his brother Joseph and
[2:08:11] James isn't his isn't his sisters with
[2:08:18] us Jesus
[2:08:20] sisters with the
[2:08:26] Pharisees did you know that even his own
[2:08:28] fleshly
[2:08:33] Brothers The Book of
[2:08:35] John it's his
[2:08:38] brothers is in his sister with
[2:08:44] us then where did this man get this
[2:08:47] authority to do
[2:08:50] this other words words he didn't
[2:08:52] affiliate with
[2:08:53] them so he's he's a Samaritan he got a
[2:08:57] devil he's
[2:09:01] mad he's a man that's got an evil
[2:09:04] spirit on the line of
[2:09:06] religion he's
[2:09:09] crazy he's out there like a wild man
[2:09:13] don't pay attention to him we know what
[2:09:15] happened to Israel they screamed out
[2:09:19] they were so sure that this man was
[2:09:24] until they condemed
[2:09:25] him in said let his blood be upon us our
[2:09:31] children it's been there ever
[2:09:38] since that's
[2:09:42] Titus Jesus was trying to tell
[2:09:45] them that their
[2:09:50] excuses
[2:09:52] am he was trying to tell them their
[2:09:57] excuses was what killed the
[2:10:04] prophet and what kill the
[2:10:08] righteous that come they accepted their
[2:10:12] Creed that men had G them instead of
[2:10:16] taking the word of
[2:10:18] God and by doing so
[2:10:21] made the word of
[2:10:27] God
[2:10:36] so didn't he say in Psalm
[2:10:40] 80 come didn't he say in Psalms
[2:10:45] 8 that his people
[2:10:49] Israel was in Egypt
[2:10:53] and he took
[2:10:54] them amen and planted
