TRANSCRIPT
========================================
maybe for Phoenix is not a this ain't nothing here but hey we are in San Diego and this ain't this ain't California weather amen so uh I guess heat has been affecting a few people I know my sister was kind of going through something there brother Solomon as well right everyone feeling all right amen just drink enough water amen uh how many are ready for God's word [Music] tonight amen just as we're standing going to read a portion of the scripture rations 3 and verse 10 we'll begin reading there we're continuing the same uh subject Joseph in Perfection uh this morning we covered some ground on the economic collapse the time of famine the things that are prophesying and how Joseph the type in the Bible coming into position amen being placed being positioned coming out of the dungeon coming out of prison came to the right hand of pharaoh am amen and there he was given all authority he given all power amen and brother Bram tells us that is what God is doing to his church in these last days first we must be prisoners and then we will be placed Sons we cannot be play Sons if we're not prisoners first amen God wants prisoners Hallelujah Joseph was a prisoner before he ascended to the of pharaoh and then we seen how Joseph received the vision to interpret Pharaoh's dream amen and that was the word of the Lord revealing what the dream meant and not only that but giving instructions preparation for the the time that was ahead amen and we are definitely living in that time and we want to read here Revelation chap 3: 10 because thou H has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth for verse 11 behold I come quickly hold fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar of the Temple my God Amen who is the temple of God in this hour amen the Bride of Jesus Christ the church amen you are the temple says we make you a pillar in temple of God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God now upon him my new name he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says and to the churches amen St Luke chap 21 book of St Luke 21 amen we'll read from the 34th [Music] verse amen Jesus here speaking of the same hour of Temptation we read uh two quotes this morning telling us plainly though that was a message for the Philadelphia Church age it was not fulfilled then there's something that is imminent for the hour in which we are living in the Reason God laid it out there brother bam said because it's the overlapping of the two ages amen and this in this age God is to do a quick and short work so he laid that before amen and then he set an Open Door amen between the two ages explains very plainly that that hour of Temptation that we read in Revelations 3 is to come in the last days upon every inhabit of the earth and that Temptation amen is to take people under the mark of the beast to lead them into Great Tribulation amen and here we we find Jesus speaking our Lord speaking of this verse 34 take heed to yourself least at any time your hearts be overcharged with suffing that's the cares of of of great overloading and burden amen and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you unawares amen see this is exactly what we saw this morning do we read that this morning in a different way remember what the prophet said the sad thing is that many people are not aware they're not ready for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man let's bow our heavenly father we thank you Lord God for the reading of thy holy word we pray oh God that you would bless it to our hearts may you Quicken it oh God for this letter kth but the spirit giveth life oh father let us Behold The Glory clearly oh God for the perfect interpretation Has Come Oh God has showed us that we can see face to face we can be changed into the glory that we are beholding oh god father we pray Lord that that what we're pointing to Lord may it reflect in our lives make it part of our character part of who we are part of our life Lord something that settles down deep on the soul lord with word upon words is being added oh father that Satan cannot interpret these things and he cannot impersonate these things father so we pray God that your Holy Spirit would give to each one Lord and come upon us this evening the spirit of Revelation and of wisdom to illuminate our understanding the knowledge of Jesus Christ to show us our inheritance in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated amen blessed be the name of the Lord we would like to go back to Genesis 41 amen amen we'll read two two more scriptures Genesis 41 verse 14 then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his rment and came in unto [Music] Pharaoh so this is a change of Rond Hallelujah this is a change of ministry yes sir and PHA said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee that thou can't understand a dream to interpret Joseph answered Pharaoh saying it is not in me I shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace amen amen now so Pharaoh tells his dream from there on out and then we want to go down to the 25th verse and Joseph said unto Pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one God have showed Pharaoh what he is about to do am verse 29 I'm making emphasis on what he is showing concerning the dream being interpreted by the vision it's just like Nebuchadnezzar he had the dream but the dream was of God Daniel received the vision to interpret the dream and tell what he dreamed right and give the interpretation so this is what Joseph is doing by divine revelation Amen in Vision how many know that we are to be brought into that realm in this hour how many know that brother bradam said in the message mzc the great Prince that the human beings live in three realms how many know he said that how many so the first one is the humanistic realm is that right then he said then next is is the the the the realm of Revelation and vision is that right then he said in the third is thus sayith the Lord yes sir so we see that God promised to bring us into that real is is that right are we to go from justification and sanctification then the baptism of the Holy Spirit but from there brother Bram said is where the Pentecostals fail is that right they thought that being born into the family settled it amen hallelujah but he said they they failed to recognize he said in the message desperation the one he preached after the token they failed to recognize that there is a placing of son Hallelujah God is wanting to bring his children his wife is elected Amen to this realm of thus sayith the Lord this realm of Revelation and vision because the secret is this the word is in the bride she has the mind of Christ amen and she knows what he wants done with the word and she has thus sayith the Lord or she keeps still that's what the prophet said spoken word is the Original Seed 1962 so if she has th sayth the Lord amen she is brought into that see is one thing to say we have th sayth the Lord but it's another thing to live in that realm a prophetic class of people amen that is living under that realm of out of the humanistic realm into the realm of Revelation and vision too many people amen are wanting to understand this message this word of God by a humanistic realm and they try to reason it but it must come by divine revelation and the Revelation gives you a vision of the word hallelujah we see that from his childhood days Joseph had a vision of he would sit on the throne and that his brothers would bow to him Hallelujah he saw himself as a sheath mature how do he know that there was one in our days that was the first one to reach maturity he was the first grain of wheat he was the sheath to reach maturity amen he was the first one in this spiritual Resurrection out of dark denominationalism to rise and be lifted up into that cloud 30 mil High 25 miles across he changed his rment he was placed here ye him full Authority and power brother Roy Robertson had the dream remember he said is there something about a cloud upon a mountain he said yes Matthew 17 remember my message hear ye him he said he has been given power to speak things into existence amen standing in the Gap message yes sir brother these things are realities this ain't playing church amen this is reality of the word of God and He is wanting to bring the church to lay aside the foundation of repentance of laying on of hands amen and let's go Forward Unto Perfection chose perfection in this house a body covered with seven colors Seven Virtues Hallelujah am amen hallelujah hallelujah that's what the very name Joseph [Music] means the Lord has added amen am so the Lord adds to our faith virtue he adds to our virtue amen Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the Lord have added J amen amen so when he sees this great vision his whole life he's living amen under this inspiration no matter what his circumstance is his eyes is focused on what the Lord has showed him in the vision he's he he's being accused of rape but he still has his eyes that one day I don't know how but I'm going to come to that Throne I'm going to be a sheath mature Hallelujah I don't understand maybe what I'm going through now but what I do understand that is taking me to maturity it's taking me through a process amen you understand so now when he comes to this place Hallelujah Hallelujah is he brought out of prison is his rment changed was Jesus reignment changed in Matthew 17 Hallelujah is that the adoption ceremony and he shaved himself amen we read the quote this morning the message prisoner what did Brother Ram say he said God has to shave our our own will Hallelujah he interpreted that scripture right there amen said God still has to shave some things off of Our Lives we have to be Lambs you have to have that nature of a lamb Hallelujah to allow the D to come upon us and say this is my beloved Son and whom I well pleased is that what he said at Jordan is that what he said in my Transfiguration he ye him we have to have that nature brother bam said when we when we take on that nature of a goat amen we begin to back bite amen we begin to come under that that that nasty nature he said that dog flies away he he he has no goal amen no sir he won't stand for that but he said he's waiting there amen for you to come back and surrender yourself amen you know where you left them you know the area in your life amen where you begin to lack in prayer you begin to lack in hearing of the message amen you be you begin to lack and you begin to to to be more uh carried with the things of this life you see what Jesus said in Luke 21 amen that's why many people are not conscious of what's Happening of the spiritual world I'm telling you amen when this comes we'll take them by surprise but this is the hour of preparation this is the hour to get ready throw your bag of peanuts away Hallelujah there the train is at his last amenu there's no time to talk about this one and talk about you understand brother I don't want to spend time on that I want to be focused on the prize Hallelujah I want to be focused on Perfection let us March forward let us press on Hallelujah and let us diligently seek him see not just seek Him diligently seek Him Hallelujah and know that he is is that right this is an hour of relax an [Music] hour it's all you hear now oh yeah all the the right I believe it all you see it's not about that remember this morning remember the the mystery of restoration in the mystery of judgment one was lost was one was restored to the Palace yes the the mystery of judgment on the baker why the fouls ate his flesh amen Revelation 19 Hallelujah the king Made A Feast for his birthday amen and in that feast he sick to kill the baker doesn't Revelation 19 say come Amen to the Feast of the great God Amen the fouls of the air come and feast on the Flesh of captains and of Great Men amen that's that's the mystery of judgment but the mystery of restoration is the butler coming back to his position in the Kingdom Hallelujah to serve wine to the king Glory I will restore sayth the Lord I will bring you back to your ordained position amen you see is this an hour of Dreams is this an hour of Visions the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh how come a lot of people having dreams here because the spirit is upon All Flesh giving messages but there's got to be a true interpretation amen and I believe we have the perfect interpretation is that right with Divine Vindication amen he is the Divine interpreter of God yes sir amen said no no one has a right to judge a prophet's message is that right and today his message is is being tested here being tested there oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother the word tests testes every Son of God and the God of this evil age he said this bride will be tested by the word just like Eve was tested by the word but this bride will not Fallujah she's Bluff proof amen hallelujah glory to God Amen she's not made out of material that Bluffs Amen brother said when when you come into that realm of perfect Faith amen he said you you come into bride material raptured condition already is that right so this is why Joseph is in this realm you understand what I'm saying he's in this realm of Revelation and vision the others they can't interpret it you see they're in the humanistic realm the very one that had the dream is in the humanistic realm can't understand but it takes one prophetic inspiration Amen to be in this realm and begin to give preparation we have the message to prepare USU word is is perfect verse 29 he says behold there comes seven years listen of great plenty we know the story but look great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt there shall arise after them seven years of what verse 30 and there shall arise after them seven years of fam and all the Plenty listen all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egyp and the famine shall consume the land see the Plenty amen is it known in these modern days see that for the rich and the merchants amen there's plenty is that right the time is coming when that Plenty when those great stalks amen will come crashing down economic collapse I'm not talking politics here I'm talking the word of God economic recession brother bradam said the sayth the Holy Spirit a Great Depression is coming is that right Jezebel religion amen he said spiritual and physical see people just take it spiritual yes he M right they go to and fromo seeking to hear not for Bread and Wine but to to hear the true word of God bread and water but seeking to hear the true word of God and failing to hear it is that right is that a famine too is that spiritual amen do we have spiritual food in due season did God told the prophet did he give him instructions amen store up food Hallelujah when he came to his positioning when he came to the third pool when he come to the opening of the word anointed ones at the end time he said first pool Divine Healing second pool amen the discernment is that right he said third pool the opening of of the word is that what he said so when he come to that when he was taken out of the dungeon hly and he was taken 30 mil High hallelujah hallelujah amen amen from there you see that he began to say this was a mystery that was hidden under the seals this was a mystery that was hidden it was not just that week in March it was marriage and divorce it was who is this MC amen he was unfolding the mystery and all this was to be stored and and he said these tapes Hallelujah these books will fall into the hands of the predestinated amen did it fall into your hands amen did it fall into my hands glory to God see and he said someday they'll know that this is the truth this is what say the Lord you know that when he was saying a lot of things in that day not many people understood amen amen and he said you're not supposed to catch amen said something is taking place here if you can understand that he say this is the third pool so when he come into that he he began to store this food for us in the spiritual amen amen but we we're looking now this morning and this evening to the to the the literal part see there's coming a physical depression a famine see the Plenty shall be forgot amen verse 31 and the Plenty shall not be known by reason of the famine following for it shall be very Grievous amen and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to amen look Joseph being position 38 Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is what I like about Joseph I skipped the verse but I'm just going to mention what I like about Joseph is that he's humble he he's giving Pharaoh all this knowledge you understand what I'm saying he's preparing him he said you have to do this in the time of Plenty store this much away do this do this giving them instructions preparations and then he says find a man wherever you want to find they put over this amen you see if it would have been someone else today they would have say no I'm I'm I'm unemployed right now so right but he said whoever you want to choose Amen to put over this in charge amen see he was humble forc himself into that position he let God do the thing is that right and when Pharaoh seen that wisdom and all these That Couldn't interpret his dream all these great you know men that he had he said who can we find like this that has the spirit of God in him Hallelujah who can we find amen look what he said this is beautiful he say he he says verse 39 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as as God ha showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as they are Thou shalt be listen to this position amen Thou shalt be over my house and according unto Thy word Joseph not my word amen Thy word hallelujah amen shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt Pharaoh took off his ring oh man amen you can preach a whole message on that right there the signant the signant amen the cealing ring is that right remember the days of Esther remember that amen the king gave unto Esther amen and unto her uncle the the the the Ring of the king that's the seal that's the signature that's Authority that's power to seal any letter to seal anything the name of the king amen didn't brother Ram say when a son is adopted his name on the check is as good as the father's name he has the sign ring that's Authority that's power amen look what he says here and he put upon Joseph's hand he put it upon Joseph and array him in vors of fine linen and put a gold chain his oh my what does the next verse say and he made him to ride in the second Chariot glory to God which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt I am see the I am giving him Authority the king re and Pharaoh called Joseph's name Safa and he gave him to wife Asin the daughter of of par priest of AR and Joseph went out over all all right Hallelujah let's go to chapter 47 I want to get these scriptures established here amen amenu you can write them down you can have this you can go over it again amen look at Genesis 47 oh so this is this is showing us from verse 12 Joseph nourished his father and his Brethren and all his father's household with bread according to their families now listen there's famine already amen amen hallelujah hallelujah everyone is coming to Egypt you're going to see in a minute what they're saying and the same thing is going to repeat again in this money will be worth [Music] nothing hallelujah amen economic collapse the dollar inflation amen amen is that is that prophesied amen I want to get into a little bit of that tonight I don't know if we'll have time anden you just pull with me amen how many love the word of God isn't this rich is it the word so beautiful and Rich amen I love the word now notice are we promised to be nourished in this time of family is everyone else starving brother Bram said eat out of a garbage can amen or what he saying spiritual food in due season he said this food is not for them he said this would make them sick to their stomach this is only for the bride didn't Jesus say this is my Steward whom I have placed to give you food in Du season hallelujah hallelujah so are we being nourished spiritually let me say what's taking place spiritually now will happen in the Physical Realm we've got to be fully dependent upon almighty God Amen we're not depending on the economy we're not depending on how the dollar goes or goes down or however whatever happens brother we we have to have faith upon what God has promised us in this hour Amen brother Bram said the church in the last days will have to have faith again to multiply the fishes and the bread yes sir Hallelujah will have to come in the realm of Revelation and vision to operate under that anointing that he said would strike the whole Church of the Living God Amen we prophesy that amen didn't he say filled Sons amen will speak and their word will be back someone will say brother my crops amen is dying I send you rain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Silver and Gold Have I know what I have I give un to thee brother we have to recognize amen this ain't just just feeling us with knowledge this is to give us Faith this is to nourish us to give us strength and prepare us for what's coming there's many that will be unprepared brother amen but God is preparing a bride in this hour amen that she will know what the Lord is about to do is that what Joseph told Pharaoh amen so we being nourished so you notice just just uh uh Joseph's family is being nourished verse 13 and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan faint it by reason of the and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt the land of Canaan the corn which they brought and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house money failed hello money failed in the land of Egypt in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money fail Joseph said give the cattle I will give you for your cattle if money [Music] fail so on and so forth if you if you if you continue to read you find as we were mentioning this morning they gave themselves as slaves to the systems amen of they gave themselves they said hey we're dying our money failes my family's hungry I'm hungry amen we need sustenance I'll a slave to the system that's the Temptation that's coming the whole world the whole world not just Christians but of course it's aimed for the briide all these things that they're doing who do you think is for or who do you think is against is to put pressure on us amen am didn't he call it the squeeze hallelujah amen you're going to put pressure squeeze is that right oh my what is this the hour of Temptation is coming upon the whole world okay look look what what what we see here brother Bram in the message the Philadelphian Church age in the exposition of the church ages he says he says this because you have taken my word paragraph 313 but thou has taken my word word and lived it and thereby become patient I will keep you from the hour of Temptation Hallelujah huj which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of the two ages for This Promise has to do with the end of the Gentile period see what he's saying why in every age God was giving the specific message amen we all remember the church ages right every promise to the Overcomer amen amen amen bam said is accumulating for this last day are we eating from the tree of life has he given us a white stone with a new name are we eating the hidden Mana all these things were promises for the ages gone by but we in this hour in the spiritual realm we're part taking of these things and of course brother said when that time comes the resurrection and the Rapture it will be in its fullness amen will be in the new city eternity but look this is something that he is speaking like I said at the beginning amen this is to the age of Philadelphia but this is in the overlapping amen and he's giving this and he says because you have taken my word and you have lived it you have and you thereby you have become patient I will keep you in the hour of Temptation amen that will that will come upon all the Earth and then he says this promise of keeping us is to do with the end of the Gentile period you understand what he prom was he what he's promising there in Revelations 311 is for the last day bride because we will be here living when this temptation comes you understand what did Jesus say in Luke 21 amen was he speaking of the end time said they will come unawares he said pray watch ye therefore that you will be counted worthy to stand before the son of man see all rightall how many how many we we're understanding so far what I'm showing you is amen by the word is that we we we said enough this morning about being a prison right and if you want to study more about that go to the message 1963 July 17th a prisoner brother Bram in that message very beautiful message brother says Joseph was first a prisoner and then he become a place son amen and then he said and that Vision that Joseph had of being on the throne he never left it while he was in prison hallelujah hallelujah that's what kept them alive that's what kept them with faith in God he knew that had to be fulfilled amen so that kept him alive and then the time came amen when he was positioned and brother bam says as in he show us he he talks to the church he talks directly to the believer in this last hour he tells us having we've been promised also to be positionally pleased hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we must not lose the vision amen let's keep our eyes focused is that right all right now look how many know amen that when this when this hour of Temptation comes we begin to get pressured we have a promise what we've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of his power amen hallelujah you see God doesn't use his his power for show amen he he he doesn't turn Stone into bread for show no sir amen there's got to be a purpose behind it brother bam said you have authority you have power amen when you're in the line of duty and you have need for it then God will back your word is that right like Joshua stopped in the sun like Moses opening the sea wasn't for show it was for necessity in the line of duty and what's coming brothers and sisters hallelujah huj how many understand what I'm saying what's coming is for necessity you will need that Faith you will need that kind of food you won't be able to buy you won't be able to sell Amen brother bam said that little hunted persecuted group he he says that the bride let see in church amen that haunted group amen hallelujah right here there will not be one person let us in church age 360 that will sit with him on the throne this is granted only to the word bride Hallelujah do we have that Vision Joseph had the vision I'm going to sit on the thr one day Glory you say that's in the Millennium yes I understand that but this is spiritual reign in the message Jehovah Gyra brother Bram said Sons adopted spiritual Reign ruling and reigning is that right hallelujah hallelujah oh glory in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light he said Billy Paul had the dream he saw the great Stone coming down from heaven he said you know what that was Billy that was that was Daniel's Vision Hallelujah coming to crush image in the feet amen the T toes like he speaks in the message the conference amen the Eastern power and the Western power and and those two had the the two big thumb or the two big toes amen and Eisen how amen am and did that great Stone without hands come yes sir it came Hallelujah a revelation from almighty God not by theology not by man's interpretation not cut by man's hands directly from almighty God the angel with the book in his hand send it down to the seventh angel Hallelujah to reveal it to his people to yes sir and brother bam said in that message there's a man here that can turn on the light he said first he got to crush spiritual Kingdom because we got to cast this Kingdom of Satan down and we go up Hallelujah Ephesians 3 verse 10 to make known to principalities and Powers a knowledge of Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother mam said he comes down and we go up but brother he's not coming down by by his will because he said I will Ascend my throne above the Stars God says I will bring you down to the size of the pit Hallelujah hallu glory to God this is the hour brother someone's got to Dethrone him yes sir someone's got to cast him down there got to be a people who won't be deceived who will come into Perfection and when the power of this church Rises it will raise it they cannot be made perfect without USU yes sir this is the hour of perfection it's not your fasting not your prayers or your repentance that grants you privilege to sit on the throne but it would only be granted to the word bride hallelujah hallelujah and then this she is United to him so only they who are of that word he is as he is of that word will share the throne and a short powerful demonstration of the spirit this little H hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus hallelujah we're not going to go through the persecution oh no but we're going to get a taste you understand because the type in Genesis Joseph's wife is there when theine starts Joseph's family is there when the family starts amen but it's right in the middle it's not before and it's not after right in the middle Joseph dismisses his wife to the Palace Hallelujah hallelujah amen are we going to be dismissed Hallelujah and he'll reveal himself to his [Applause] brothers amen yes Hallelujah you see so this is where we're at okay now I want to I wanted to read this right here amen Philadelphia Church Age Again now because what what are we focusing on this temptation will be upon the the whole world Amen this this great time now look it says right here Philadelphia Church age okay notice this is beautiful he says notice the the the work will be short up goes the church and here comes the Antichrist bringing destruction with the whole Bible now okay he says here it proves 257 that the last of the church ages moves to the first part of Pentecost for they go on into Great Tribulation which shall come in which did not come in in Wesley age says notice verse 11 a Crown of Life behold I come quickly hold fast that which thou Hast no man take away thy [Music] Crown right what is a crown a crown means that you have a domain you are a king if you're Crown see and we are sons of God and we're crowned with eternal life our domain is the Earth make you PRS and Kings unto God is that right so there you are only the very elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows so he begins to talk about The ecumenical moves The ecumenical mov seems beautiful blessed uh uh uh Christ prayed that we all might be one my wife was was laughing earlier because we were at the restaurant and we were talking about that this morning remember and the waiter there uh one of the ones that I believe he's Christian we talked to him before witnessed a little he remembered us he said hey you guys gave me a little card

church see how all this is moving see it it's becoming stronger amen it's coming back around that cycle to where it was supposed to be amen we're coming in line here see and this is what he's talking about then he says he says then that movement will put pressure upon the government and then the government through adherence to principles and enact into law see so that no people will be recognized as churches unless under direct or [Applause] indirect I can say a lot of things right there yes sir there's a lot right now that indirectly oh no brother we're not a denomination God have mercy said once in that there's no out amen hallelujah amen amen and they say that much look I I want to I want to get to this point here he says this will be accomplished okay here I want to back up the church SST of Rome the Roman Catholic Church the Protestant coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious tra will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper the Harlot will destroy hello the present day Mone the Harlot will destroy it amen amen amen by what listen to this the Harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold and with no gold the system Falls that's collapse brother the Jews will be trapped and come into the alliance and the Harlot church will take over the whole world now brothers and sisters this is the this is the thing that is coming upon the whole world and he said and the Temptation is to remain to remain a public church right oh he says we can't close the doors we got to keep preaching the gospel amen

that pressure many times not always they acted correctly Abraham was a backsliding Preacher Brother amen then on top of that he's outside of the promised land and then he lies Hallelujah and God says you take his wife you're dead that was just a covenant unconditional with God and Abraham but brother M he was still out of the will of God Amen he was a backl why why did he go somewhere else because of the famine you see Hunger made him to do things that weren't correct that's coming again friend amen was there famine in the times of Elijah yes sir amen did he have the word of the Lord did the Ravens feed him during that time did he have a secret place amen and brother Ram said we have been brought to the secret place amen the only provided place of worship is that right Hallelujah amen now listen after the Days of Elijah there was also F in the Days of Elijah was there famine in the days of Elisha did the spirit of Elijah fall on Elisha is he a top of the church amen after the Days of Elijah the prophet amen when he ascends and drops the mantle down like Jesus did in Acts chapter one when they saw him go up and the angel said the same way that he has gone up he will return again and he has returned again hallelujah hallelujah so you see this he said this uniting time and S remember the message he said seven angel coming down Gathering the scattered word to loose the Holy Spirit bring down his holy spirit that had been bound for nearly 2,000 years under the door of Creeds and dog amen but is to be let loose in the evening time by the evening time message amen this is what this message come to do did it come to bind us in some system to find us in this or in that they come to loose the Holy Spirit to rule and reain in our hearts would be Sons and Daughters of God living under the inspiration of God without any ties without any control the liberty of the sons of God to be led of the spirit to write another book of Acts in the end time Hallelujah huj that's the church brother that's the people that the prophet of God that brother BR wanted to see says I don't want to see that group I don't want to live the day when they rise up that's what he said hallelujah hallelujah and brother what he planted must produce a harvest hallelujah hallelujah and this Harvest Time amen spoken word seed must produce spoken word children if he planted spoken word it's not to produce spoken word yes sir amen oh my brother said God don't like cowards he likes his people to stand in the line of his word regardless of what comes or what goes and he prophesied that this would come so in the days of elij Amen there was a woman that the creditors had come to take her children slav Hallelujah but there was an anointing on elishah and he said you need to empty your vessels God needs empty vessels empty yourself out empty out the F of the world things of the cares of this life get yourself out surrender yourself to him because the oil is loosed it's growing and it will fill your vessels you say but brother I've been DY for a long time I haven't felt that power of God in my life for a long time it's because you haven't empted out you haven't surrendered to God you haven't given up those things that he constantly in your conscience it brings you back but that's why we're saying tonight let us lay aside the foundation and the repentance and coming back to the altar all of hand together why a constant cycle in the church why Always amen do we see God speaking to us and then he speaks to our problem he speaks to our issue and it goes over our heads and then when the trial comes one little trial oh we don't know what to do what will it be when the greater trial comes we can't pass these trial oh brother let us lay aside childish things when I was a child I as a child I walked as a child but when I became a grown person I put away childish things amen this is that hour yes sir because God needs my people that is mature amen knows what it's doing this is why amen hallelu Elijah the spirit of Elijah is sounding Out an echo in this hour Spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing amen amen it's not a different thing siru we're still black and black and white is white we still got an absolute we still have a TI post and that's the word of almighty God Amen and in the days after Jesus after the son of man had been revealed amen and he had discerned he had called your name is Simon son of Jonas he had revealed the Messiah after that Ministry come the book of Acts is that right in the book of Acts Amen in chapter 11 amen there was one that rose up and prophesied said there's coming a famine remember that agabus in the Bible Acts 11 listen what the prophet says in the lean Church age concerning this he says first this age will have only one Prophet messenger Revelations 10:7 when he singular shall begin to sound there has never been an age God gave his people two Major Prophets at this at one time he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses alone and he alone had the word through others prophesy John the Baptist Alone look what he's saying then he says here in the last day there is to be one Prophet we're not waiting for another Prophet amen amen amen hallelujah the mystery is finished but the thing is it's got to be finished to you it's got to be revealed to you see the prophet said trying to do God a Ser without being his will not the years in preparation but when he shall begin to sound the trumpet in the Rapture message he says when I was in the healing campaign I knew all the time there had to come a message that's what he said but now look one major prophet he says now this last day there's one prophet and the infallible word say that he the prophet will reveal the Mysteries to the end time people and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers those there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I challenge that statement I'm reading the quote hu it is a ball invalid assumption in the face of Revelations 107 listen now I do not deny that the people will prophesy in this last age my Hallelujah is there going to be a people that prophesies in the last days well you got to check the prophecy did did Micaiah prophesy after Elijah amen did he check his vision with Elijah's prophecy amen and when he when he checked it with the prophet's message he knew it was right Amen brother there's a prophetic anointing that is loosed for a prophetic class of people is that what he said so but it's got to be according to the word because you can have a lot of say the Lord this and that and it's not the word sounds beautiful amen sounds great amen like Billy Paul told Brother BR remember amen uh Grand Grandma sharan right he said th he said the walls were sweating he said the the anointing was strong amen people were in the spirit the anointing was strong the walls were sweating and someone rose up said thus sayth the Lord she shall live to see the coming of the Lord you see and Billy had already heard amen his father say the Lord [Music] she's came out said Daddy I don't understand what happened you said she's going to die then there they said thus say the Lord she's going to live to the coming of the Lord said he didn't speak against that he didn't he says all I know Billy is everything he's ever told me has never failed that's all I know Billy said I understood amen see it's not according to the word amen amen there's nothing there now look he says I do not deny that the people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct amen hallu see I do not deny that there will be prophets is there a fivefold Ministry this hour is Ephesians 4:11 in effect amen so look he says here I do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a family I agree that is so amen hallelujah but there's no two Major Prophets there's only one messenger today hallelujah amen glory to God now so we see now days of Abraham days of Elisha amen we can speak of more days but we're giving the types in that s that we might understand what we're coming into this you give me Hallelujah more minutes amen listen say this is where the church fails brother they thoughted see they thoughted because they were born of the spirit that that settled but you see there is a placing of a son and after this son proved to be a real son he taken in a public place and he is set up there he's changed his robes and there then there was a placing of a son and he had he had air of everything the father had that's what God did with his son now Transfiguration and that's what he'll do with his church in the last days the church is so far from its place it needs to be back to its original place as Sons and Daughters of God rulers Governors under the spiritual Reign it will somay Hallelujah Now isn't this beautiful god of the Cil age we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have to if you're seated there and don't believe it and you're afraid to move you'll never use it Hallelujah but if you are seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do Hallelujah huj you're ordained to do what you do amen but there are some he says who are children of disobedient out of this evil age brother what why is is it that is obedience is such a big deal God wants stewardship amen he wants stewardship yes sir if we don't have stewardship he can't depend such a great thing to put in your hands another thing is character if you don't have character Authority power without character satanic so in order to obtain this character he takes you to the fire a little bit amen takes you uh uh like Joseph rejection amen sometimes you have to stand for things in the word and everyone else be against you to see if you're going to stay with that word you're going to say well maybe yeah you see what I'm saying and brother bam said I would rather he he says I honor a man who stands for his conviction even if he's wrong but he stands for what he Hallelujah God don't like wishy-washy stuff amen oh no no Hallelujah he doesn't he wants that Spirit of el of Elijah on us brother what you go out to see are we shaken by the wind didn't he say in Ephesians 4J GL amen what is the ministry for to bring you to Perfection that you would not be a child anymore but be established in the present truth not to be shaken by every wind of hallelujah hallu oh brother these brothers come and they say oh brother you know it's not like that it's like this no then these other brothers come they say well brother I got a few quotes here that probably haven't read and you know look at these you see what I'm saying brother you've got to be established you got to know in who you have believed God has not given us a spirit of bondage get to fear he has given us the spirit of adoption why we cry father amen A sound mind yes sir this is what it's about brother oh my the thing is shaking right now yes sir amen that's that angel with the fan in his hand shaking the wheat Hallelujah glory and the shock has been blown away hallu Glory because there's coming a time brother said where in her will be the fullness of Pentecost was there three Believers in in in the upper room oh sure it was only grain there Judah showed his colors before and the make believer amen and the unbeliever saw their colors before that time Glory this is that time brother this is time to show our colors this is Harvest Time It's the End of the World Jesus said what is the Harvest that's the end of the world and he will send his angels as he send his angels to GA his elect glory to God they ask brother the question what is Mark 13 He said that will take place before the glory to God brother that's taking place now GA in his ele bringing them to this place of spiritual Reign spiritual position brought up in the Kingdom of Christ oh what a huge portion of Heaven awaits you amen this the tremendous victory in the love divine yes sir do we have prophecies do we have things that God promised us amen are we to walk in this hour amen amen just a few references if you want to write it down it's all right but look isn't it prophesied in Revelations 18 verse three that the merchants of the world amen are connected to the Harlot system yes sir it's the economics of the world connected to that oh brother Revelation 6 ver 5 to8 black horse Pale Horse balances in his hand yes sir economics a measure of penny a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny that's control of the economic system amen Gathering the wealth of the World by their prayers and no venius amen they got the gold standard brother yes sir they got the wealth of the world in their hands is that right is that the word and in the and in the Bible oh in the Book of James 5 veres 1-6 the Bible tells us something tremendous because we're speaking of the time when money fails amen economic recession but there's got to be sons of God who are depending solidly upon God that will know if that time comes Hallelujah God will have to provide some way brother Bram says it'll have to be again for this exus because this Exodus is not to another country it's not to another church another denomination another Revelation belief or something no sir this is in my father's house are many man and in that Exodus over there there was provision ISS Hallelujah there was Mana from Heaven There was water from a rock glory to God God fed them God gave them what they needed and in the second Exodus in the days of Jesus Exodus out of law into Grace that's what the prophet taught us and in that Exodus there was also Provisions he multiplied the little boy lunch glory to God he gave all that he had to Jesus GL he by himself he couldn't do nothing he couldn't feed 5,000 he couldn't feed his family he couldn't feed the church he couldn't feed those who he Lov do you understand what I'm saying but when he gave it in the hands of Jesus he was able to do something with that he was able to multiply it and feed as many as he wanted and still have 12 baskets Hallelujah afterward Glory That's The God Who We Serve

was nothing he spoke a squirrel into existence that is the greater that is the power amen that is to be manifested in the fullness of its power in the time of a squeeze glory to God stand to your feet do you believe that do you believe that brother prophesy you see there's a a center of the road I believe we're not to go to the left we're not to go to the right there's a there's a middle of the road a Highway of Holiness is that right and all the trash is on the sides now notice brother here the prophet says in the message speak to this mountain s Jose California he he is speaking when that anointing Came Upon him is that right and he he said to Har right whatever you ask speak it and I'll speak it behind [Applause] you amen he said she could have asked for a million dollars it would have been right there on the table she could have asked for her sister amen paralyzed there he said she could have asked he said for the restoration of her [Applause] [Music] youth she asked the correct thing he said the Holy Spirit knew what she was going to say because those boys names were written on the Lamb's Book of God before the foundation of the world and the third pool called their Hallelujah did the opening of the word call your name he says it's calling in your name not or the mystery is calling your name Hallelujah you believe it by faith amen notice brother he says he talking about this this anointing that come upon him and he said he he called it super anointing hallelujah amen amen he said this anointing when it comes he said Banks Woods fell in his plate amen he said every brother isn't it amazing that every time God had the prophet in those five identifications to use the third pool whether he was kneeling whether he was on the tree whether he was on sitting on the boat every time he told him stand to your not one time did he did he use a third pool in any other position Hallelujah stand amen amen he was praying on the otoman for his wife amen amen stand

glory is that right every time there's something about standing on your feet amen something about standing on your feet yeah and when that anointing strikes brother Ram says this speak to this mountain Hallelujah he says I'm looking for it to happen I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing will strike the in the whole Church of the Living God she'll rise to her feet hello hell when that anointed would strike the prophet he would stand to his feet amen and he says here that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll raise to her [Music] feet remember the dry bones Hallelujah they stood to their feet Glory a mighty marching arm yes sir hallelujah hallelujah can these bones live again see rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the death will hear the will be raised up the power of God will shake the whole world with the Church of the Living God and Christ is a mystery of God revealed he says she is flesh and his flesh quickly made alive which was his body that's the word it's been laying dead for years and it's been gradually coming in the Reformation but now she brother we've got to stand on our feet in this we got to stand flat foot amen hallelujah look musicians come he said the the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit amen amen in the token message he said another surge of his holy spiritu doesn't mean that this is coming to baptize us or to do something it's for a purpose brother mam said people think anointing is to do everything else but what the God wants you to do he said the man with the greatest anointing amen said I am anointed to preach the gospel Amen to bind the broken hearted to heal the preach cap Liberty to captives he says and he gave the he said this day the scriptures forf that's anointing to recognize your day and it message amen and he said he gave the book back and he went and set down precious words to proceed out of his mouth he says we think and there's nothing against that nothing against shouting dancing all that it has its place amen no sure nothing against that brother Bram said I'm a Holy Roller why I am a Holy Roller he says because the apostles were because John was one am he says that over there on the other side there's a lot of holy Ro that's why I'm one from the top of my head he said to the bottom of my feet inside outside all around yes sir but what I'm saying you understand what I'm saying brother said it's Supreme control [Music] Supreme control master of all circumstances oh brother brother said he gives us many examples how when he Jesus went in kicked out all the unbelief when he spoke amen brought the soul of that young girl back into a body he says that's real Supreme control now listen he says [Music] here she'll be an invincible one he says there's coming another service there's coming another time is that right correct says this this super anointing is going to get greater in the message my new ministry he says it's gettinger you believe that amen amen Revelation book of symbols this great Supernatural power that lays in the church is in her but it lays [Music] dorant Revelation book of symbols it lays dor we all know the identification we know what the third pool is you all have the tapes on that see and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it will speak it'll manifest just like the five straight signs without failure [Music] amen amen oh [Music] my there'll be a people will have to stand there and be the reproduction of Jesus christu that cannot be done by any other thing but by that power the resurrection and whatever God has called you to do whatever call The Mystery of his will for your life see that's where that anointing will strike amen when we get out of our place that's what we're holding that back that's what's That's What's happen God is waiting for his children to fully come to that to that place whether you've been called to be a housewife amen amen that's your position you see might not be over here in the in the raising of the dead and the signs and wonders but whatever God has called you to do you stay in that line amen you can't work in another Channel he said in the message I have heard but now I see you have to work in the channel that God has given to you amen hallelujah yes sir that's the thing when brother brand he tells Us in that message he says I was under that channel amen when those squirrels were spoken into he says there's a channel open for the bride in the last days hallelujah amen many try to take the prophet's position that's right amen it shows they don't know their own position amen that's right brother said I can't take Orman Neville's position orille can't take he says I can't be a billy gr right amen amen that's that's the problem that's why God has such a hard time everyone wants to do what somebody else does say see God blesses somebody does something to someone everyone wants to follow you just be who God has called you to be and in that place this is truth brothers and s in that place God will bless you in that place God will lead you it might not be great big things you'll see the hand of God and the little things in your life to give you Assurance he's in control he's in control of Our Lives he's wonderful [Music] brothers I don't know what stage of your life you're in perhaps you're still at the father's house being rejected by your brethren jealousy envy against you or maybe

our heads
