TRANSCRIPT
========================================
coming down CL the cloud and in verse two he has a little book open this is the book that was seal with Seven Seals he Roars as a lion and seven Thunders under their voices and John is told to seal up the words verse seven says but in the days of the voice of the seven Ang when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished you have declared to his servants the prophets you have to understand that John is in a vision and he seeing this unfold before himself brother mam said in the message revelation of Jesus Christ that it took John about two or three years to write the Book of Revelation Amen to write the Book of Revelation if you were to begin writing now from verse one of chapter one and write it all the way to chapter 22 the last verse it wouldn't take you three years is that right but the reason it took him many years because he was seeing this unfold before himself this was Revelation he was hearing things he was seeing things and he was commanded to write what he see what he heard but there was many things that the angel told him don't write amen don't write what the seven Thunders have utter you understand so what how long did it take him seven only God knows brother does tell us how long it took him to write the Book of Revelation you understand what I'm saying but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound what amen what he heard which was sealed and written in symbol form it is in the Bible it's in there but it is sealed is that right what's going to be made known the mystery of God is going to be finished is that right Hallelujah and we see then verse eight The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth what are we speaking on this morning the right to the Tree of Life what do we read in Genesis 3 verse 24 he has become as one of us least he stretch forth his hand and take the little book let us Place Cher amen who's the book of am who's the Tree of Life who's the River of Life it's all the same person in different form different symbols there's only one source of eternal life and that's God himself he is the author of eternal life is that right so he is The Book of Life in the message it is the rising of the sun brother says the seals was Jesus taking the seals off of himself taking the seals off of himself he the book thund he's the Tree of Life he's the Book of Life did we read in revelation 22 amen he that know all his Commandments he has a right the so you see Revelations 108 I hope you're in the channel this morning you're supposed to come prayed and prepared amen singing and worshiping God so when the word is going forward you're in the channel Revelation 10 why is John a type of the Bride able to stretch forth his hand and take the book why revelation 22 14 those that have a right to the Tree of Life are those that does all his Comm Hallelujah but in order to fulfill that Revelation 224 the full revelation of the word had to come because Jesus as we seen Wednesday was the only one that was able to live by every word in the message Harvest Time brother mam showed us is that right that Moses live part of the word but he Smit The Rock and he got angry he wasn't allowed to enter into the promised land that was Moses failing though he was a great prophet though he was anointed though he had great Visions though he was one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament he fail Noah a great prophet That Was preparing a people to go into the new world hallelujah amen the only way of Escape was through his message a great prophet is that right but yet once he come out of the Ark the Bible says he planted a Vineyard is that right and then he drank from it and got drunk said Noah failed glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so no matter how great these prophets were even John the Baptist brother bam said why did Jesus say that John the Baptist was greater than all the prophets amen it was not a man born of a woman as great as John the Baptist is that right glory to God he said because he was to introduce the angel of the coven amen that was the reason he was great he never even performed a miracle but he was greater than all the prophets but Jesus himself said Hallelujah huj but the least in the kingdom of God is greater than hallelujah hallelujah GL because brother and sister the Old Testament prophets never receiv the Holy Ghost in their soul amen they were never born again no sir it take the blood of the Lamb to take away sin in order for the Holy Ghost come back into the human heart there can not be a Pentecost without a Calvary hallelujah hallelujah and we understand brothers and sisters that when we see then that even all through the ages amen the Tree of Life wasn't at the reach man is that right God in Revelations 10 are you with me is letting man the bride John to put forth his hand and take the Tree of Life Revelation the voice tells him go and take the little that is open in the hand of the Angel who is that angel the angel is the one that come down from heaven with that book in his hand he is the tree of life he is the one that gives life to the word listen to this are you with me now so he takes the book which is open in the hand of the angel in verse N I went up to the angel and said unto him give me a little book oh my that's access to the tree of life that's the right to the tree of life the way is open to come in John a type of the Bride it's being commanded by the Angel by The Voice go in when before the cherabin were blocking it keep them away now the voice is saying in take the booku the tree of stretch listen now and and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it shall make belly bitter but in thy mouth oh shall be sweet listen listen L verse 10 and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up Hallelujah and it was in my mouth with his honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was spitter and it said unto me thou were I'm I jumped over to chapter 13 it said me thou must prophesy again before many peop nations Tong anding the bride being giving access the right to the tree of life because in Revelations 101 the little book is open that is the breaking of the Seven Seals and the opening of The Seven Seals come only after the denominational ages have ended is that right amen the denominational churches produce death they are the tree of the knowledge of good needs brother said when a man today depends on the church and eats from the church if you eat from the Catholic church Baptist Church all right Pentecostal Church Methodist Church the day you eat thereof that day you die Revelations I saw a star fall from Heaven that's the knowledge of Good and Evil but in Revelations 10 the Tree of Life comes down from heaven both trees coming down in the end time who is the Tre the knowledge of Good and Evil Satan according to the Ephesian Church AG Hallelujah which we've already spoke on that last Sunday night is that right now notice the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil coming down Revelations 9 the Tree of Life coming down in Revelations 10 and there is a river also river Euphrates Hallelujah where there's 200 million demons is that righten but there's also a River of Life that flows from the throne to satisfy the hungry am and the Thirsty is that right this is eating again in symbol type form you understand am amen the bible let me hold up on that now listen we see if we go back a little bit here into Genesis and we we we realize when God placed man in Chapter 2 Genesis the Lord God plants the Garden of Eden amen amen and verse 15 if you notice the river Euphrates is there as well verse 14 same as in Revelations do you understand what was in the ri what was in the Garden of Eden the river Euphrates what is in Revelations 9 what was in the Garden of Eden tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what's Revelation n the star falling from heaven with the key to the bottom of his pit is that right yes sir but in Revelations 20 the angel has the key to the bottom of his spit and a chain in his hand that's not the same Angel Revelations 9 is Satan Revelations ISR you understand amen Revelation 9 is showing you Satan he set with the Triple Crown he is the king of the bottomless pit amen amen notice in verse 15 and the Lord God took man and put him in the Garden of Eden and dress it to keep it amen amen now brother and sister once he placed man in the Garden of Eden he placed him there to establish them to make that place of all the world make that place his headquarters is that right amen the headquarters amen was in the Garden of Eden brother bam says that he placed amen Adam there in the Garden of Eden and he placed them in this Dominion Amen in this place to have dominion to Genesis one over the fish of the sea is that right amen over the fouls of the A and the message power of God to transform he says we find out that that all this after he made it he transformed it its kind and its life and it was to all put in by the word of God the Creator we find out that this all headed up in in a headquarters called The Garden of Eden now notice God brought transforming power and he changed the chaos the darkness amen the the void amen without form dark and chaotic Hallelujah and he transformed glory to God into a beautiful Eden now the whole world was not the Garden of Eden how many understand that the whole world was beautiful the whole world there was no sin but when God transformed brought forth the Earth amen brought forth separated the waters he brought forth the dry ground he brought forth the trees he brought the poers of the earth he brought all the animal life all the beautiful fountains all this beautiful place the whole world was beautiful and the whole world was in a perfect climate amen but the whole world was not the Garden of Eden there was a specific Place amen amen that he made the Garden of Eden and from there is where he put man and his wife do you understand that is God's plan in this hour and it's God's plan in eternity from the palace from the pyramid City that will be God's headquarters and outside of the city it's beautiful people live eternally people are saved people are are still enjoying eternal life amen but those within the city they rule and reign with Christ Hallelujah yes sir that is not headquarters it will be the second Adam and his wife ruling and re from headquarters do you understand now he says and all headed up in a headquarters called The Garden of Eden and God put his son and his son's bride Hallelujah over it all see this great creation he had a reason for it he made everything so pretty he made the flowers the life the birds and there was no death no sin no sorrow no sickness and then all this great things headed up into one big headquarters he keeps emphasizing which was the Garden of Eden and there he put his son Adam and his Adam's bride his wife Hallelujah now notice when we look at this we have to understand something what was in that Garden of Eden do you believe that in the book of habac it says that the glory of the Lord shall fill the Earth like the water covers the sea yes you believe in Isaiah 6 the chub cry holy holy the Lord God Almighty and great is his name it fills the whole earth amen yes sir over in the Book of Psalms it says the Earth is of the Lord and its fullness is that right but we understand that the whole earth brother Adam said God is Not Omni presentent he is not in every place amen amen he is omn amen hallelujah because of his omniscience he is omes Hallelujah because he knew everything that would be before it ever was you understand that say Amen why am I saying that because even though the whole Earth is filled with his glory God is in everything God is in nature God is in the singing of the birds God is in the growing of the grass God is in the Tre God is in nature amen but yet the spirit and the presence of God is only where he is invited it's only where he is revealed hallelujah hallelujah the presence of God is only where he is revealed where he is accepted where his plan is unfolding and that is in his in this you believe that everything else is everything else the glory of the Lord has Departed the day inations took AED instead of the word of God fath the glory leaves and it never comes so the glory of the Lord the presence of the Lord is only where his perfect word do you understand hallelujah hallelujah so he is omnipresent because he's omn why am I saying this because in the Garden of Eden is where his headquarters was that's where his presence was Hallelujah that's where the Shina Glory that's where that P was moving and the only place that God in the evening he wouldn't visit everybody he would only visit Hallelujah hallu the purifier would appear and say my little children I'm good morning or good evening Hallelujah good evening friendu how are you doing this evening I'm with you is everything going good GL to God Amen oh brother we realize that same P of fire he our by thece of God we have access into that Garden in this hour the third fold mystery now reveal it's the seven SE hallelujah hallelujah all that God was he pour into Christ all that Christ was he pour into the church and now Adam and Eve back in the Garden of Eden a threefold revelation of Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the is the mystery of Christ when Jesus come to the Earth he fulfilled every scripture he fulfilled the fullness of the word of God but inside of him was a mystery he was the revelation of the mystery of God but in him there was still another Myster that had not been revealed on the day of Cal amen when his side was brok he by the Roman spirit in questions and answers on the seals brother Adam said it broke his heart it pierced his heart glory and from there come water come blood and come life that was the birth of the of Jesus Christ and through seven Church ages a portion of that mystery of the body of Christ was being a little bit here a little bit there here come Luther here come Wesley and the elect of his day they were part of that mystery that was hided in Christ but in the last days the fullness of the mystery Hallelujah entire body amen a that would live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God is that right hallu that word that's coming full every word is what we live by that gives us the right to the tree of blessed are they that Hallelujah every word not just a part not just justification justification not just sanctification not just gift hallelujah oh glory to God listen to this not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got the quote in 65 brother said listen to this he said the church would go from justification to sanctification to the baptism of thehost and then the Perfection of the Ring the son of man Hallelujah the son of man being revealed ride for and when that first one that reached maturity that son of man was revealing himself through one bride member through one bride member but now is the revelation of the son of man Hallelujah in the rest of the Bride men and when that is being unrevealed and unfolded because brother Bram was not the mystery of God revealed hallelujah amen is that right he was the mystery of Christ amen the first fold of the Revelation you get it the first four of the Revelation is Christ is the mystery of God revealed all that was in God put INR but the second all that was in Christ puts him in the Bri that's why I'm saying brother Bram was not the mystery of God revealed he was a mystery of of Christ he was in Christ when Christ was here on Earth you and I were in Christ when he was here on brother Bram is part of the Bride but he was the first one in where the son of man was being revealed one member but now the son of man hallelujah hallelujah that l 1 second did you hear what I said that makes Luke 17 the second F of the mysty yes sir and I got the quach tonight brother I got ammunition to tear up the Devil by the message itself brother said a son of man revealed in his in his people to he what Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man we are feeding of the body word of the son of man it's the son of man being revealed that's the fullness that's where his presence is that's where he accepts your worship nowhere else only in the son of man in the son of man only in the promised word for that's where he put his name that's where he'll meet you glory you believe that where in the garden Hallelujah in the that's where he meet you that's where his presence ISJ He blesses people around the world he heals people everywhere else not just here but he doesn't dwell in everywhere hallelujah hallelujah because of his om he knew who would be in denomination who would go against the word who would be outside of that word therefore he only visits Hallelujah of the Lord and is pleasure that's where he has pleasure huah where pleasure in the heart of the nowh else that's where he plant his SE where in theard what do you do in the garden seeds you you you you water it you watch it grow you take care of you water it so more and then when it gives fruit to huj Hallelujah we eat of him and he eats of uselu we have pleasure in him and he has pleasure in us hallelu he is our hiding place and we are his res Hallelujah the word is in the this is the secret the word is in theallu hallelujah amen and the mind of Christ the spirit of God is in her she knows what he wants done with the garden hallelujah hallelujah glory to God do you see the picture so notice and God's power to transform oh my notice what he says Kan wanted to come back into the presence is that right amen able wanted to come back into brother Ram says this he's reading from Genesis 4 verse 4:16 Cain went out from the presence of the Lord go than the land of no on the east of notice verse 17 and came knew his wife she conceived and be and be a son right what was the name of her son Enoch and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch when goes out from the presence he's still religious he is still filled he's the serpent he's filled with that life which is death but notice when he oued from the presence of God he still tries to impersonate he still has a son and that son's name is not that son's name is not anyone else but an impersonation of the seventh Sonu amen you don't think K knew who the real Enoch was you don't think knew that he wasn't a son of Adam hello what am I saying brother that no matter what it looks like it can be so close you can have the same name it can look so close that it can dece the very left but I don't care if your name's Enoch amen amen you have to be in the presence of God you cannot produce children of God outside of his presence and when is out from the presence he produces an impersonation you understand this is what we have we we have to look at brothers and sisters this is why when Moses built the Tabernacle the high priest was the only one that was able to enter into that presence no one else because he was ordained of the word to enter in once a year into that presence is that right and his every his every step had to fulfill the the Commandments of God don't you see church that it's the same thing it's the right to enter into his presence the right to enter where the hidden Mana is the right to partake of the tree of life it must be by every word when that PRI are you understanding me was ordered by God himself through Moses through the law this priest will come in once a year this is my ordinance he has to do this and this and this and this and this and this and if he doesn't do one of those when he comes into my presence he'll fall dead do you understand that it's the same thing like in the Garden of Eden with one word was broken they were cast out of the he said the day you eat thereof that day you die one word broken took him out of the garden it'll take every word to take us back in blessed are they that all his command all do you see it Church All Through the Bible and the priest had to fulfill every commandment given to him not given to someone else given to him he had to wash himself he had to change his clothes he had to slay the land he had to take the blood he had to cry holy holy is the Lord God Almy he had to shake the bells no one else that could do it for him he had to do it himself and you are the only one that can go into the presence of God God has no Grand you you have to come in the same way that every Son of God hallelujah hallelujah and the only way that the outsider knew that he was fulfilling every word every word and that there were still life in him is that they were here him fulfilling the word it was just noise it was fulfillment got to be fulfilled and the part of that part of the Fulfillment was crying holy holy hu and part of that was ringing the B hallelujah hallelujah that wasn't just making noise it was fulfilling every commandment amen the truth and the outsider would say oh he's fulfilling the word he's fulfilling the word and brother said how do I know that there's still life in a church it's when IU hallu Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah we got to fulfill the word amen no matter what your flesh says no matter what your mind says no matter what you say you die to that you have to Die daily to have a Revival am we must never let the Revival die we must always Revival because Revival it's not in some building it's not in some church it's inside of the heart of Christ I AMU Hallelujah I am the Revival of the in the last days you have a right blessed are they that do all his Commandments the priest had to fulfill every commandment every commandment and on the veil of the holy of holies was sown to CH just like in theard did you know that read The Book of Leviticus the book of Exodus amen and I believe in numbers too you'll find amen and in that veil of the temple amen right here on 67 in that Christian Museum they have a replica amen yes sir of the uh of the Tabernacle of Moses you can see and they have the scriptures there Amen on that veil was two cherub one on this side and one on that side that was they were guarding the way to the tree of life but the only way that one man had a right to enter was to fulfill every command all his Comm they have a right and when he would enter in Oh Brother bam saying the veil would open by he wouldn't take his hands and open the Veil did you know that the veil would open by itself as soon as he would come to The Veil The Veil would park and open that was access to enter in to the Tree of Life brother and sister when this Angel come down from heaven he had in his hand a open Seven Seals were sealing the veil imagine here's the curtain and there's Seven Seals one from the top but when the lamb breaks the seals Hallelujah the veil can be open and that's access to the bride to come in that's right inside of there what was in there the ark Hallelujah and what was inside the ark the tables the word hallelujah and that's why when when John is inside inside glor was the presence of God in the outer courts where was the presence in the Tabernacle was it out there was it in the Holy place where was where was the where was the dwelling of his presence where was it it was in the it was in the holy of Hol only there hisence not in the outer Court not in the Holy Place only in the garden Hallelujah all in the garden his presence and when he would enter there then the voice told John inside the holy of holies take the book stretch for your itd man only GL that's right you see the picture this is why brother I believe the bride people that knows and recognizes his presence brother preached the presence of God uned where is the presence why do people not recognize his presence why because they don't know where it is and where it's at you understand that's why when the presence is here they don't recognize brother say a true sign overlooked amen he said that's the Angel that's the true sign he is the sign for the last days is Christ Hallelujah the presence of God are you hearing me what are we talking about what was the presence it was in the garden and today we the bride has to be in tune with that presence we have to be sensitive to that presence people today they just to see an AG they're so D they're so cold they're so hard pres so hard to the word so D that when you can speak the word you can speak Mysteries you can the presence of God is still unrecognizable they're still looking at the veil they're still looking at the flesh they're still looking at at brother so and so and the pastor and the de looking at the man but if you can recognize presence of God is here our M you will know that that's the word going forth behind hallu you see this is what I'm on the inside of the inside in the thr room that's what I'm I'm not eating of the flesh will I'm not eating on the flesh am I'm not eating on the flesh brother Gabriel I'm eating on the body of the Bride I'm on the body hallu you have to recognize his presence and where it is and then I have a desire to come into that presence and then once you come in have a desire to stay there to remain there and never come out of that let me read this to you without money without price I was preaching on this Friday night now notice I heard our beloved Pastor brother Neville make a remark on His Radio cast this morning it went over in my mind just I can't forget it I quoted it to a friend of mine last night and there after taking he said that the time will come where the taking away of the Holy Spirit out of the Earth how many know that how many know that there's coming a time that there will be no more Holy Spirit for the world for nobody though they can cry they can come to the altar they can bang on the door say open up I want to come in brother we won't have no more church services we won't have no more services you won't have a pastor up here preaching this message you won't have access to the life the door will be closed the way to the tree of life now it's open right before you right now Jesus said I am the way I am the I am the truth but the day is coming when the Holy Spirit will be taken and it'll only be given to 144,000 only no one else will be receiving the Holy Ghost except 144,000 brother I believe the greatest torment in the tribulation is that the presence of God is not there do you hear me today the day is coming when that Holy Spirit will be taken away from the Gentiles there will be no more Holy Ghost there will be no more preaching of this word no that day would have ended the testimony of the Bride will preach to the eternally L like Noah being sealed inside the ark his testimony preached to the eternal life and brother this ministry of the Bride like every other ministry will preach to the eternally lost that's say the Lord that's what he said yes sir brother and I believe that the hour is getting late I believe the door is closing I believe the time is close amen but you have to want the presence if you have become go if you have become in a of sin cry out to God hallelujah because you've got to hunger you have to have a thirst for the pr of God if that hunger's not there you won't want enter into his presence it's got to be a hunger so that hunger has to be placed there God himself blessed are they that thirst and hunger after righteousness the hour is coming where that Holy Spirit that way to the tree of life will be closed there will be no more access no one else will have a right to the Tree of Life only 144,000 will you say Amen there will be no more amen ministers true ministers preaching this way to the Tree of Life brother said over there it was chub listen he says that I believe they they they were to come into the presence of God God the tree of of life was guarded notice they had been taken away from it and there was a sword there that turned every way keeping the way to the tree of life but now the sword is turned the opposite direction to is is drawing us listen it's driving the people and hurting them no hurting hurting like a her amen hurting the people is that right how many know if the if the herds off scattered like that amen they they have to put pressure they have to put pressure and make and make their space less and less is forcing them in him to go in One Direction Hallelujah I pray that God will reduce your space I pray that God will reduce your Liberty I pray that God will reduce the space you have so you can come in One Direction hallelujah hallelujah yes sir the Holy Spirit speaking today it's for you listen and he says here now the sword is turned back the other way running them driving them into the tree of life amen and brother Adam said the gospel is being preached to turn the people back into the tree of Lord hallelujah hallelujah and he says here in the Ephesian Church age listen to this listen to this Ephesian Church age 196 brother says notice now instead of an Angel instead of an Angel out there keeping them away from this tree it's there the angel is out there to round the people take them to the tree of life it's to every person bringing them back to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who is the tree of life that stands in the paradise of God that you might partake of him and become a son a daughter of God he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that s have eternal life that won't come into the Judgment but it's past God must be what we want what we desire what we hunger amen if that hunger is not there we won't try and get in desperation to go into that presence and and on top of that listen to this quote look what he says how many heard our brother Neville make that statement this is without money without Price He says after the taking away the Holy Spirit out of the Earth the formal Church religion will go right on not knowing the difference people today don't know the difference oh they preach the message they preach the word oh he preaches a message they all preach the word it's all the same it's all the same message they don't know the difference right you have to know if the presence of God is there or not amen amen amen hallu God only visits his garden God only dwells in his that's where his presence is it's not everywhere it's only in one place and he says this he says he says they don't know not knowing the difference how many heard that congregation says amen wasn't that aound they don't know the holy spirit so they won't know when it's gone wow oh Lord they don't know pres today so when he leaves and he says that they won't know when it's gone they'll just be going right on just the same when the last one is sealed into the body of Christ they will still be going on trying to bring converts am because they won't know what it is and their formal religion will continue on just like they were it may not sink into you like it did to me that statement let it sink inlu it sink into the don't let it go over your head the holy spirit is speaking to you you're the one that's sitting here this is not being preached to that liquor store over there or to hosana fellowship or or or somewhere else to you Hallelujah that's right amen not preaching to the chairs the walls here to you is that right sometimes it comes you know speaking to me it's the Holy Spirit speaking to yes he's speaking to you now notice he says he says they'll go on they they'll still continue on they won't know when it's gone because they don't know what it is their formal religion will continue on just the same it may not sink to you like it did to me but that was really an astounding statement that they'll be so far away just in religious rituals until they won't miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with God have mercy on us brother I'd like to live in this life is my desire to the least bit of his grieving that we do something that Grieves the Holy Spirit the most minimal thing that I will know it in my heart when I hurt him if I should do something that would breath him that I would be able able to feel it in a moment let alone his absence let alone his absence brother his absence is ter his presence is still here the way is still open hallelujah hallelujah the angels are driving you warning to come in but the day is coming when that will be taken away there will be no more Holy Spirit don't Harden your heart don't make yourself hard and try to save oh I already know and I I have this and I know this no brother be sensitive open up your heart allow him to take you into his presence and then when you stay there have the same desire that the most minimal thing if I look at my brother if I say something if I if I if the enemy brings a thought to my mind and I entertain it Lord whatever it is let me Lord feel that in my heart and quickly get down on my knees or wherever I am and say Lord forgive me let me put it blood let me walk in the light as you are in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ es us from all sin and we can have Fellowship one with another his presence very soon will be taken away do you do you understand amen hallelujah 20 more minutes and I'm done we're still early Hallelujah am blessed be his name do you understand the right to the Tree of Life is to fulfill every word I'm not telling you that you have to start to fulfill every word and say I got to do this and then next I got to do that and then after that I got to do this then after that I got to do this that's not what I'm saying I'm saying he Jesus Christ already fulfilled all of the word you get him inside of you you would have fulfilled every commandment Hallelujah live word just get the Holy Ghost in you and he will lead you he will guide you Hallelujah he will show you he will direct you he'll he'll rebuke you inside you do wrong even the most minimal thing you'll
