these things we got to know what we're doing in this battle you got to know how to use the word the sword amen it comes out of our mouth to cut to pierce amen to pull down strongholds amen amen let me give you a few scriptures amen amen let let's go in our Bibles and turn over into the book of Hebrews 11 and I just like to read it three verses there and verse 33 you know he Paul here has already mentioned many warriors of faith and verse 32 he says what more can I say time would fail me to tell Gideon and differ begin to name all the different ones and he says who through faith subdued kingdoms brought rightous obain prises stop ESC of the sword out of weakness were made strong WX Val and F turn to flight the armies of the alien see that what put armies to flight faith faith you understand Deuteronomy 32 verse 30 how should one Chase th and two put 10,000 to flight said their Rock had Sol them had sold them and the Lord had shut them up how many we put in the flight here one what th put 10,000 Hallelujah brother let's let's let's read a few scriptures herey 2 verse S the Lord shall cause thine enemies to rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face he shall come out against the one way and flee before the seven ways amen amen verse 13 the Lord shall make the the head and not the tail Thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken into the Commandments of the Lord thy God shall command thee this day to observe and do them what brother say Deuteronomy means law life or death the whole book of Deuteronomy telling the children of Israel if you obey my word thisen if you don't obey my word this if you obey my word if you don't obey my word always life defeat Victory amen hallelujah chapter 20 verse Deuteronomy 20 deuteronomio B let's read from verse one thou goest out battle against thine enemies and see his horses and chariots and the people more than thou be not afraid of them the Lord thy God is with thee which brought the up out of the land of egpt it shall be when ye are Come N unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people shall sayto them here oh Israel you approach this St to the battle against your enemies Amen Let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of him for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies save for amen amen now when we look at these things all these things are shadows amen amen and when we realize what let's read a scripture in the Book of Psalms 44 you realize these these same promises for us in this day and hour spiritual warfare we wrestle not against flesh and blood then we take these promises God in his word we we realize that today we don't go out we don't fight we don't you know kill people naturally like they were doing back this is a spiritual warfare the same promises for for the natural Warfare the same promises for us in the spiritual real today Psalm 44 verse through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us amen amen let's go to the Book of Luke New Testament chapter 10 Verse 18 and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents the Scorpions over all the power of the enemy nothing shall be any means hurt you by any me not with standing in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice your names are written in heaven amen amen hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 12 wrap this up tonight and we want to leave some scriptures here because we must understand God has given us these things for us amuah the greatest weapon of his word authority and things we have by his word we must take it now F amen Matthew 12 and verse 26 Satan cast out Satan his SK is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house and this this is in the same direction now a strong thing he's going to say right here he that is not with me is against me he that gather not with me scatter abroad what what is he talking about the strong man of the house is to be bound and he's Bound in the Sou when you run into his house you begin to take back the things that he stole amen but if you're not Gathering he says with me amen then you're scattering abroad Matthew 16 he say 19 I will give Thee I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever th shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven amen amen now what have we been saying The Authority in these things the power that God has given us but we must understand we must understand where does that power lay where is the weapon for this Warfare of God it is the word quicked in your mouth amen amen that destroys the enemy amen amen turn with me Proverbs Proverbs Hallelujah verse 21se 1821 death and life are in the power of the tongue amen and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof amen amen let's turn to yes Book of Romans Hallelujah Glory chapter 10 verse six but the righteousness which is a faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above for who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead notice what Paul is saying here this is a powerful thing because what he is speaking of comes from the ninth chapter into the 10th chapter where is saying amen that the Jews were not in the spirit of Faith trying to achieve the things of the word by the law he goes on to talk about Moses and the things of the law amen amen and then we find brother bam had an experience when he had the vision of the Seven Angels coming to him and the scripture that was open to brother BR was the last verse Roman 9 as it is written behold I lay inside a stumbling block a rockable fence who shall but the verses above that you see what Paul is speaking of exactly talking about faith righteousness by faith amen and righteousness by law do not work then he goes into this then he says here in verse 8 10 but he is talking about Christ talking about Christ who shall say Ascend into heaven amen amen who shall descend into the deep can talking about Christ who is Christ Christ is the word amen but what saith it see his answer his question he says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth amen and in thy heart mhm that is the word of faith which we preach amen amen the word is n the even in thy mouth in thy heartu that is the word of faith that if thou shall confess with thy mouth amen Lord Jesus Shall Believe In thine heart that God rais him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture sayth see he goes right back he he returns to Romans 933 that's his that's what he's talking about the stone amen amen The Headstone in this hour for the scripture sayth whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen but brother he talking about Revelation he's talking about the faith in the heart believe for righte and then confessing with the mouth the word is n to mouth and to th heart to speak those things right amen then brother we have to understand amen amen that that is where the word must be now but it must be it must come through that channel of the word brother Adam said in this day the same seed that fell in the Garden of Eden has come through a process and has come back to be the seed again the whole seed this is Harvest Time this is seed time this is back to the original life back to the Bible Mali 4 would say would be that way and in order to be this way you must have all the word that's the reason Revelations 10 had to take place that's why I had to take the trip to tuon to open to the church these things the seal amen amen open and then see the manifestation what that was the word the seed there's only one thing the Harvest is here she's dead right she's ready now for the coming oh brother it will be at the harest time that the seed will be back to its original condition we must have all of the word in order to be the seed you cannot have half of the seed it won't grow there's got to be all of the se you say I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking in Tong that's part of the seed but now there's added to that hallelujah hallelujah there's more see the life not the gifts the life of the gifts you see what I mean we're at the end time you cannot have half a seed it's not to be all the seed the word has become flesh exactly what he promised Luke 17 Mal all the Revelation all true life that was in the stock and back there it was gathered now in the sea ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha has become Omega the first has become the last the seed that went in has come through a process and has become the seed again the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden died over there now has come back be the seed again the perfect SE the seed that fell in the Gard of Eden was the original SE the spoken word seed the Hallelujah was the spoken word seed Jesus Christ coming back having the word in his heart having the word in his vow speaking the word bringing things to pass that's the reason why will he GA began to manifest that first grade of weak Rich maturity it brought these things back to the remembrance of the church to have us to recognize the way that the seed will be manifest in this hour there will be no impersonation of the spoken word you cannot impersonate the spoken word with power the way it is you can impersonate speaking in Tong you can impersonate shouting and jumping you can impersonate preaching the gospel you can impersonate laying on of hands you can impersonate all kinds of things but you cannot imperson the spoken word yes sir the spoken word cannot be imp person the only way the spoken word is Manifest it is to the predestinated seat of God and that predestinated se has the word to their heart and to their mouth Hallelujah we have to understand that it's not way out there somewhere hallelujah huj it's it's now it's now here and here here and here it's mouth it's heart why because we have come to the time where the sons of God creation is growing the world is growing Heaven is crying hallelujah hallelujah everything is waiting for the manifestation the Son of God time Prophet already call Warriors to fight and take the sword of the word but we have to know how to use it's by the mouth and by the heart because we cannot speak something that is not in our soul and Jesus told the Pharisees you call me good Master but in your heart call me a devil you you you you hate me but in your heart if the heart does not speak with the mouth what is truly in there you're only condemning yourself amen am and the word will not come to pass it will not come to pass but from the treasures of our heart the mouth speaking that's why the word must constantly be closed close to our heart close to our mouth amen stand your feet the word says amen amen in the book of you don't have to read it but Ephesians 4:29 says that we are not to use our mouth to speak perverse things we are not to use our mouth brother said to speak things that does not profit wow we're not to use our mouth to speak things amen not according to his word we are not to use our mouth to speak defeat but many times because of what's in our heart we begin to speak these things we speak defeat you need to speak oh it's impossible oh I can't do this oh is this my my my faith is weak that's the language of the devil but we' got to keep the words to our heart not to our mouth always to be close it's got to be present it's got to be there his word it's got to abide in us and we abide in him Hallelujah the word is not in our mouth but because what comes out of our mouth is either death is in the tong for death and life but brother we will eat of the fruit of what comes out of there we will participate of the fruit of our mouth doesn't the Bible say we are Kings and Priests to offer spiritual sacrifice unto God by the what by the what fruit of our lips fruit of our lips fruit of our lips amen amen yes power of life and is in our tongue thing is brother What atmosphere are we in the thing is what's in our heart the thing is is the word nigh unto us that we can confess with our mouth because we believe with our heart there's there's the thing musicians come and when we got that we got the most powerful weapon
