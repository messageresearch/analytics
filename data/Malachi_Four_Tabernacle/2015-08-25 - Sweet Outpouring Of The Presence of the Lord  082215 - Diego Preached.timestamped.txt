[0:33] tried to
[0:34] explain it's a gift brother that gift is
[0:38] in the
[0:39] soul you see you see how it
[0:43] connects it's in the soul that's why he
[0:45] said in
[0:46] 65 people say I got the baptism of the
[0:49] Holy Ghost he said that doesn't mean one
[0:50] thing that's right he says if you are
[0:54] not predestined if that Gene if that
[0:56] seed that soul in you didn't come from
[0:58] God he say you're just you're just a a
[1:01] Brier and a wheat bre and a wheat

[10:48] revelation of what to give him to
[10:51] drink it is said that it is said that
[10:55] the reason they gave him vinegar
[11:00] was because that was the order to the
[11:03] Roman army to
[11:07] give to their
[11:10] soldiers that's what they would
[11:12] regularly drink sour
[11:17] wine
