[1:05:50] for the day that we're living in
[1:05:52] valencia
[1:05:53] because the emphasis
[1:05:55] today
[1:05:56] is certainly
[1:05:59] laid upon education
[1:06:02] and upon
[1:06:42] they go to college to complete their
[1:06:44] education
[1:06:54] you have to at least have high school a
[1:06:56] high school understanding or a college
[1:06:57] education
[1:07:41] ignorance
[1:07:42] yes sir yes
[1:07:45] but what we are finding out
[1:07:48] is that we're not to lean upon it
[1:07:52] is that right
[1:07:53] not to your own understanding
[1:08:50] the world
[1:10:00] accumulated
[1:10:41] my word is
[1:11:10] hallelujah
[1:11:52] as
[1:12:21] somewhere to lean on in the shower
[1:12:23] that's what we are depending on in the
[1:12:25] shower
[1:12:26] jesus said it's believable
[1:12:29] my sheep know my voice
[1:12:32] a voice
[1:12:33] it's his words
[1:12:48] they're not subject
[1:13:30] the things that
[1:14:40] his
[1:14:54] that's all
[1:15:08] if you lean on your own understanding
[1:15:10] today
[1:15:11] when you're sick what is it available
[1:15:13] maybe sitting in a wheelchair
[1:15:16] with cancer
[1:15:17] heart trouble
[1:15:19] the doctor says
[1:15:20] you're gonna die somebody if you lean
[1:16:04] according
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:46] and when god tells
[1:17:14] you
[1:17:26] my perfect weakness
[1:18:38] that's
[1:19:06] when
[1:19:34] he can do
[1:20:02] special
[1:20:58] we cannot use
[1:20:59] one ability
[1:21:02] we've got to make a complete surrender
[1:21:08] we've got to come this law
[1:21:10] you've got to surrender to him
[1:21:27] i know jose because we're always wanting
[1:21:29] to put
[1:21:30] our part in
[1:21:33] something that we know
[1:21:36] you know
[1:21:37] we want to do
[1:21:40] well we say
[1:22:07] how can you have faith almost an effect
[1:22:09] when you are preferring
[1:22:12] one another
[1:22:14] when we are expecting
[1:22:17] this guy
[1:22:18] he's a great person
[1:22:20] this is a great person
[1:22:21] i'll just lean upon him
[1:22:27] listen to that
[1:22:28] this is a great person
[1:22:34] that displeases god
[1:22:48] the abilities
[1:23:04] in
[1:23:32] just look around and find whether it's
[1:23:34] right or not
[1:23:36] i don't know hallelujah
[1:23:38] what a good thing to do
[1:23:41] hey man it will never be
[1:23:43] to every person

[1:28:12] the bad thing why so he can increase
[1:28:15] him
[1:28:18] see how much you can humble yourself
[1:28:21] so that he can grow i can work his head
[1:28:23] that's what is possible it's about
[1:28:25] nothing i'll tell you
[1:29:49] we can't keep this gospel
[1:30:00] i can't keep the words
[1:30:17] that we have the ability
[1:30:46] instead of depending
[1:30:59] if we can't get so many
[1:31:10] that's just
[1:31:12] a carbon knock in it
[1:32:38] it reminds
[1:32:51] amen amen
