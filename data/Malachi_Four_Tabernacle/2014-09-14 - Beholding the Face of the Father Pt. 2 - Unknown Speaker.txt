body until the second Resurrection amen see I told you you guys what did I just read right you canot enter into the word body the unless you at the beginning do you understand amen amen questions and answers amen amen4 explain about each person's Angel who abides with them from birth unto death very good question question 381 he says I hate to pass this by very good questions I want my children to know these things amen the question before this was who will populate the New Jerusalem who live who will live outside of the city so then he reads the next question and he answers both of them together that's good right and he says who will populate the Earth outside of the city amen there will not be the elected or the called bride righten now let let me jump down here the bride will live inside the kingdom with the King outside Kings Kings of the Earth they will bring their fruit into the city the doors will not be closed by night light on top of the mountain let me go here they will be outside the city not the bride but the people that come up in the second Resurrection they will be tillers of the soil just like Adam wow and so forths of the garden but the king and the queen who remain in the city explain about each person's Angel who abides with him from birth if you notice he says now this is pretty deep and I never I just picked it up part of it was wrote in typ and the other part in pin there is an angel but this Angel of the Lord are enced about those that fears him see it isn't promised that Sinners have Angels amen did you hear what he said it's not promised that Sinners has Angels it's only the redeemed has angs did you know that only the redeemed has Angels amen is that too much for you there who did Brother Adam SE when he went beyond the curtain of time did I read that from the fifth seal what did they tell him we'll go back down with you we're waiting for the amen I got more quotes don't worry amen amen the thing of it is ain't no way brother somebody can enter word body the begin oh glory amen Amen on the Lord showed me the bride amen the son of man come to save they were once in the F amen but one of the hund went the son of man come

teaches that there's people in that Dimension that are not redeemed but they're safe there sure but they are not redeemed amen am church church age he tells you again the Revelation from the seals who that was how long until he avenges our blood he says they're crying out for vengeance that's not the these are soul under thear Soul under the let me ask you something and who is this brother speaks of a couple driving down the roof and I hit should f yes does your theop look like old person does your theop look like old person no no but there are souls amen amen that look like old person but there's only the 18 to 20 but how come there's some that don't look young the one brother didn't recognize one of them said she was 8 something years old when she came to Christ she wasn't old young body she was she was R material Hallelujah this Earthly Tabernacle all we one brother that angel according to brother in ministers to those shall be of Salvation that's reason why the these Revelations only angels can come and minister to them to R the Myster oh yeah that's why brother R was told be time beened your people you know that SC let's go toes Genesis 25 Genesis 2 25 these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived 103 SC 15 years then Abraham gave up The Ghost and died in the good old age an old man full of years and was gathered to his people he was gathered amen you believe there's a group of people have with ET this Revelation is throughout all the Bible brother went be the curtain of time you have been gathered with your they told him brother we'll go back with you to the Earth we don't know what's going to happen with Paul and them and the others irus and Luther but we're going back with you back to the Earth he said all these Broms he said no are the ones that are under your ministry hallelujah hallelujah with his people amen with his people his people yes Lord that's the reason why brother these angels are sent only to a special not everybody receives ministration hallu connected Hallelujah thish has been quien the spirit that chist from the dead in you it will quien your moral bodies it will bring you to subjection to the word of God and it will begin to connect am that Eternal with this eternal there is a connection the veil has been done away and we can behold the face we can see face to face why because the perfect has come let's go back to the Book of Revelation Oh chapter 5 we're going to read the first three verses I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne book written within on on the back side Seven Seals I saw strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now listen to this no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to what look there they couldn't even look at they couldn't look at the book is R when the Old Testament is R there's ail but what happens the L comes open here's the BL Hallelujah that which is perfect is come there was a blast in Arizona and then look 6 verse1 I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder one of the four be saying come and see now we're able to see now that the took the book come and see before there wasn't no one worthy to take it or to see it look upon it amen am second seal come and see third and in other words no one no one until the sea was open was able to understand what this what this Revelation under the altar was until a prophet came in this last day open it up by the L Christ reing the amen what did it say verse n he had open the fifth seal I saw be under the altar Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and Truth th thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled is that right now notice what brother says concerning this fifth shal amen amen now I've already given you uh great majority of that there already but he says in the fifth seal notice now he says the ninth verse Souls under the altar now I'm going to get some I'm going to get some real disagreement on this but I want you to just watch for a minute I always thought that these Souls under the altar were the martyrs of the early church see and I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed me the the vision to it it wasn't see and there when Lord show me those it isn't Souls now you say I don't know what about that well just a minute are not Souls of the Bride church not at all we thought that was a bride Church waiting there Soul under the altar crying how long how long let me read it again he say and when the fifth seal was open I saw under the altar Souls were slain for the word of God and for the testimony they held now notice to avenge their blood he said now at this time the fifth SE being open the church is gone it just it just can't be Souls under the altar of the church now please if you ever did give attention to this pay attention now CU this is great controversy so I want you to listen real closely you got your papers and things to write with these cannot be them Souls the righteous martyr and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in the Rapture the fourth chapter of Revelations they was taken up then he says now you people who are followers of of these teachings UAH Smith theah Smith that's trying to support Soul sleep he says he he mentioned that that the soul sleeps and there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven the only altar that has spoke of that he believes that is is in heaven is the altar of Innocence but you dear people not to defer with my brother I hope to meet him on the other side just to show how this this proves that the opening of this seal in this last day it takes the soul sleeping PL out of the way they're alive if there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is a sacrifice for sin lady there has to be a place where the slain lamb is laying and now the incense the orders the stuff that they burned which the Bible said was the prayers of the Saints if there's no sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received so in other words he's saying how can there be an altar of incense if there's no altar of sacrifice we just got through preaching on is that right amen amen this then he says now notice how can there be an altar of incense there has to be a sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through through to God but brother Smith was wrong not disagreeing with him I think I made my clear but the fifth seal has been open if you caught it see I'm waiting for my question where where was the ark the slain the wounded the bleeding see and the orders the prayers he wanted people to ask these questions but they they they weren't ready for that that's why when he's preaching on the seals he says please everybody I'm preaching on the seals we're going to have questions and answers Sunday morning he said please let all the questions be concerning this subject amen amen is that right could not ask about you know pajamas you know things like that but he wanted people to ask them about the alter incense and these different things he says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved of our Dwelling Places disolve we have one already waiting that's where I seen those Saint and at the closing of the fifth seal I might inject this here I just read he said the ones the Lord showed me he said where I see these people we were under the altar but not under the altar of sacrifice not under the mo altar amen mind for waiting for the coming of the Lord glory to God is that right Church age look what he says now the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment there is no other place that they can come up but in in the two Resurrection they canot qualify for the first resurrection so they might come up in the second which is the resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are are not in the Judgment John John 524 very ver I say to you he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life the believe is already received is already a recipient of eternal life which he has now in his possession now shall not come into condemnation shall not come into the Judgment what it really says but see as passed from Death unto life notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at this Resurrection not having previously received it as members of the Bride They will receive eternal life at the white Throne judgment amen they did not have eternal life because they weren't redeemable they are granted life at the day of judg is this what he just said amen then he quotes John 5 Mar not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evilto the resurrection of damnation that's John 5 28 and 29 listen what he says here he teaching on this same subject that we just spoke of he's speaking of Matthew 2 where Jesus said at that day amen he will separate the sheep from the goat amen the separation for the sheep of the goats is as the light Throne judgment amenu not like some brother told me amen Mex he said that that's here I said brother the books show us that the bride was separated yes see here but that's not the Fulfillment of that scripture fulfillment of that scripture says the white look at this then he says this and and then he when when he quotes St John 5 he says this is not for the rapture it is only the dead in Christ in Christ that will raise from the grave at that time and the living bride who is still on the earth will go in the Rapture first Thessalonians 4:16 the dead in Christ shall rise first in Christ see amen but it says here in St John 5 that all that are are going to come forth out of the Grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelations where in the dead were brought before the Lord who are judged according to their Works whose names were in the book of lives and were then cast into the lake of fire then he goes on and talks about this but then he says this now Paul said if by any means I might obtain the resurrection of the Dead see he was speaking that he wanted to be resurrected among the dead this is not attaining to the general or the second Resurrection second Resurrection this is attaining to the first resurrection blessed and holy is him that has part in the first resurrection the second death has no power over these but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall re with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do and has no chance for the second death this is at the end of a thousand years when all the rest of the Dead come again and at that day there will be those who will come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who are in the second Resurrection and are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind or good to the brother those who are raised and cast into the Lake of Fire will be those who mistreated the brothers since this is the word of God we simply accept it there's no argument here just a simple statement of fact listen to this to further clarify this notice specifically the words of Matthew 25 31 to 46 it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a sheep or as a shepher dividing the BS see in other words this sheep fold or this sheep that he's talking about is not of the F of the elected of the Eternal see read the scripture in Matthew 18 a son of man came to save those which are lost right he leaves the 99 the shepher leaves 99 sheep and he comes for the 100 this is not the Sheep this is what he's saying that he's talking about when he separated sheep from goats this is a different fold this is a different city this is at the white Throne judgment amen see they did not previously have amen eternal life the Sheep are are the Sheep of that are in his fold they had heard his voice they followed him and they already had eternal life and they cannot come into the Judgment you see what he just said the sheep that are in his phood they heard his voice how many heard his voice Amen in other words the sheep that are redeemable he comes for the for the 100 these 99 those are the ones that are of his F those are the the elected those of his F they heard his voice they followed him they already have eternal life and they cannot come into the Judgment but these these these sheep and goats don't have eternal life they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon the grounds what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they will already have his life as his bride no they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren like that like the bride are brethren with Jesus that makes them joint HS with Jesus they are not HS to anything but but life they share No throne with Jesus Etc their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed because their love of the people of God they recogniz and S no doubt they served and helped the children of God and brother that continues to explain and he goes on down then he goes and then he says this right I'm going finish with this right and he says this is it's all in continuity from ma from when he reads Matthew 25 amen he starts taking scriptures scriptures and comments re 20 and the the Saints will judge the Earth they'll even judge the Angels then he goes into St John 5 and he's proving here's the bride and here is the one that come in the second resurrection and then he goes into this stand your feet he says this Hallelujah
