TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hallelujah right brothers and sisters Christ reproduce again that great gift others I've tried to explain but this one can't be explained is it that is that the reproduction of Christ didn't I just read it Christ reproduce again amongst human beings the third is perfection third pool yes that great gift others have tried to explain it's a gift brother that gift is in the soul you see you see how it connects it's in the soul that's why he said in 65 people say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that doesn't mean one thing that's right he says if you are not predestined if that Gene if that seed that soul in you didn't come from God he say you're just you're just a a Brier and a wheat bre and a wheat patch amen but the real gift is in the soul amen how many know that that's the those are the only ones that can truly be born again only the elected of God that's right are reborn rebirth is only for the elected amen because you got that soul in there amen amen and that's the only kind that the word can bring forth yes amen so that's those are the ones that can give Christ that kind of water yes hallelujah amen is that right yes amen you see why is connected with cross and Jordan you see why it's connected with the waving of the sheath you see why it's connected with Harvest Time so here we are between his rejection and his crowning yes amen is that where we are where we at between his rejection and his crowning Gentile Warriors yes between his rejection was he rejected yes was he rejected in in in the ministry of will sir was he crucified the second time is he to be crowned in the Millennium is he to be crowned by his Saints king of saints king of kings and Lord of lords here we are between his rejection and his crowning amen amen we've got to fight brothers and sisters do don't you hear that voice saying press on saying fight this this battle don't you hear the king's desire fresh drink of water [Music] this is where you come in yes this is where you come on this [Music] scene to do your part amen amen to do what God has ordained you to do and that's to reproduce Christ in your life it might be in Simplicity it might not be seen in the eyes of everyone doesn't matter God but just be faithful to what God has called you to be that's all that matters just be faithful just be true be sincere and honest with God Amen it's so so wonderful such a privilege brothers and sisters isn't it to be able to yes it is brother to have something within us ain't that amazing really think about this ain't just a sermon Brother s this is something real Hallelujah that's right isn't it amazing brothers and sisters that you have something in [Music] you that you can give to him hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah what he's Desiring you and then sometimes we we don't want to let it out you know our pride or our our ego or whatever let's just lay that all aside let's just give to him our our hearts what he has what he has given us what he has placed in Us by by Grace by predestination think about it brother Brown says about out of the millions of in the world he said God chose you oh that's Grace that's nothing that we did it ourselves brothers and sisters but by his grace he's called us and we've got to be determined to press forward no matter what it is my brothers I know times get hard sometimes maybe sisters they go through things but let's keep on fighting amen amen let's let's continue forward brothers and sisters we're marching unto Zion amen oh don't you love him tonight just in the Simplicity uh God put this in my heart amen Lord and I can only obey what he puts on my heart to speak to you thank you Lord so IFK you Lord if we could just bow our hearts and our [Music] heads and whatever is in your heart tonight just let's just take this time this moment won't you do it won't you do it for the king tonight not trying to work up anything but it's already in you my brother and sister you just have to let it out from the inside just that life that hidden life with Christ sometimes brother say we make God our mascot and we just ask him and ask him and ask him God I need this God I want that but he said we don't sometimes we don't take the time to just praise him thank him for all all the goodness all his grace that he's bestowed upon our Liv what what privileged people we are brothers and sisters what a what a privilege it just makes you it just makes you feel that much smaller that much humbl to see the greatness of God the greatness of this message amen oh my here we are between his rejection and

amen now brothers and sisters just one last thing remain in that Spirit of worship and of [Music] Praise but I I wanted to say one last thing remember [Music] this Jesus's desire when he was [Music] crucified because of the blood falling on the ground he become thirsty and he said I [Music] thirst I thirst why because he had been crucified oh my and you know what there was some Gentile soldiers [Music] there but they didn't have the revelation of what to give him to drink it is said that it is said that the reason they gave him vinegar was because that was the order to the Roman army to give to their soldiers that's what they would regularly drink sour wine vinegar sour wine and that's why when Jesus was crucified and the blood fell on the ground he said thirst I'm thirsty Hallelujah don't you hear the king saying the same thing has he he been crucified again in this last day yes wasn't there a second crucifixtion wasn't there a blood the life of the blood the token to come back upon the believer in this [Music] hour but now there's again Gentile soul soldiers Gentile Warriors but these are not Roman soldiers [Music] Hallelujah these that are are close to the cross and they can hear Brother Frank they can hear the Lord saying I thirst oh God they can see the second crucifixion in the last days and they're so close to the king at the cross that they can hear him say I thirst but this time you have a revelation of what to give him you won't give them vinegar oh God you don't give them fresh Pentecostal water yes oh God hallelujah and and and and just look at this he had to wait 2,000 years he had to wait seven Church ages because when he was thirsty at the cross no one gave him the kind of water that he really wanted amen that's true he had to wait another 2,000 years now and then be crucified again to again say I [Music] thirst do you see it brothers and sisters am do you see a church let's give them that that wine let's give them that fresh water let's give
