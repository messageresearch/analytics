[0:00] huah because brother Ram said we heard
[0:02] it Sunday
[0:04] night what causes spiritual
[0:16] Amion when you're shock a great
[0:20] shock is that right amen is that right
[0:25] what does that make you
[0:26] do makes you lose your identity teach
[0:31] where you don't know who you
[0:33] are you begin to
[0:36] forget amen the purpose of
[0:40] God is that right brother
[0:44] saids
[0:46] me we heard it on
[0:49] T amen many times when we say
[0:54] it you
[0:56] see people might say well he's saying
[0:59] that because he wants to say
[1:02] it but when you when you hear
[1:05] it amen and I believe God really spoke
[1:08] to us Sunday
[1:11] night and you hear the
[1:14] prophet amen rebuking the
[1:17] church and saying you're fine people
[1:20] you're good
[1:22] people amen he says but you need you
[1:26] need a Revival in your
[1:28] soul he said you spiritual
[1:32] Amnesia he said it kills
[1:35] me when I go he says I go everywhere and
[1:38] I'm
[1:40] preaching he says and the people when
[1:42] they
[1:43] come hear the
[1:45] word they come with a certain
[1:48] attitude and they say Lord well I'm
[1:51] here you want to do
[1:55] lord lord it's your
[1:57] word whatever you want to do
[2:00] here I
[2:01] am said that kills
[2:04] me yes that's not the
[2:07] attitude we should come
[2:09] in he says that's what he said he says
[2:12] where's that
[2:14] enthusiasm where is that Faith towards
[2:17] the word amen where is that fire in our
[2:23] soul the word of God amen
[2:28] amen see and brother says that those
[2:32] symptoms upon
[2:36] us we don't want one bit of
[2:41] that amen hallelujah because that's why
[2:44] the age
[2:46] of blind
[2:48] naked amen wretched
[2:51] poor and she what she didn't know
[2:58] it amen called out of
[3:01] that by the word of God is that right
[3:05] not to know
[3:06] it
[3:09] spirit so now we want to speak
[3:13] tonight by the help of the Holy
[3:16] Spirit the
[3:19] revelation of the two
[3:23] altars amen
[3:26] hallelujah revelation of the two alts
[3:31] now this is
[3:33] something that God wants to bring
[3:36] personal make it personal to each
[3:39] one this is the hour where the promises
[3:42] of
[3:44] God to his bride to the
[3:48] believer amen are unfailing
[3:53] promises and those unfailing
[3:56] promises of his word amen is what is
[4:00] going to bring to
[4:02] pass amen what he has
[4:06] prophesied concerning our
[4:08] lives what we
[4:10] think amen is impossible to
[4:14] reach amen but With
[4:17] God all things are
[4:19] possible I can do all
[4:22] things Christ has
[4:26] Stranges amen amen hallelujah but the
[4:29] thing is
[4:30] we must know how to approach
[4:34] god brother mam said there is a Divine
[4:37] Way of how to
[4:40] approach Amen to God in his
[4:43] word that's the reason why he said many
[4:49] can come a certain way and they don't
[4:53] receive what they come looking
[4:55] for because we must come God's provided
[4:59] place and God's provided
[5:03] way is that right am Hallelujah now the
[5:07] two
[5:09] altars in the
[5:11] scripture this is a scene amen you can
[5:16] read it even from way back in
[5:20] Exodus uh
[5:24] 25 and if the Lord
[5:27] permits I want to continue on this
[5:29] subject because there's some tremendous
[5:31] things in
[5:33] here I'm not going to read
[5:35] this amen but in in Exodus
[5:40] 25 he begins to tell
[5:44] Moses amen how he is to
[5:48] fulfill the
[5:50] vision that God gave him upon the
[5:54] mountains when the
[5:56] cloud came to pick Moses up
[6:01] and In This
[6:03] Cloud amen Moses has a
[6:06] vision and what Vision does he have he
[6:10] has a vision of the Tabernacle of
[6:13] God he has a vision of what's in heaven
[6:18] and this great
[6:19] Tabernacle which is what he
[6:22] did when he came back to the Earth to to
[6:26] the children of
[6:28] Israel amen amen this great vision that
[6:31] he had the Tabernacle of the
[6:34] Lord was beginning to unfold
[6:38] itself because he then begin to give
[6:43] instruction and there was predestinated
[6:46] people amen that was going to fulfill
[6:49] these
[6:50] things the purpose of the
[6:53] vision amen first of all was a place so
[6:59] that the children of
[7:00] Israel could come to that place and
[7:04] worship God it was God's provided
[7:10] place for
[7:13] worship and the other thing is that he
[7:16] wanted to come in the Fulfillment of
[7:19] that
[7:21] Vision he wanted to come down and
[7:25] dwell in the midst of
[7:28] Israel
[7:30] did he dwell in the midst of
[7:32] Israel when the when the vision was
[7:35] fulfilled Israel was all around the
[7:40] Tabernacle and he was in their
[7:42] midst is that right was God himself
[7:46] there did he go behind the the
[7:50] veil in the sh
[7:53] Glory filled the whole
[7:56] house but it stayed in a certain place
[8:00] is that
[8:01] right amen so all that Moses
[8:05] see
[8:08] on in
[8:10] heaven amen he come back down and he
[8:15] pitched the
[8:17] tent that right and when he did that it
[8:21] was because there was a people there
[8:25] that had been called
[8:27] out is that right they were called out
[8:31] of Egypt they were called out by that
[8:34] message amen God had already come
[8:37] down and said I have come down with a
[8:41] shout to deliver my people amen I'm
[8:46] coming this way they were a called out
[8:48] people there were called out
[8:50] group so God had predestinated
[8:54] people elected
[8:56] men amen that were going to help
[9:00] Moses in the Fulfillment of the great
[9:03] vision the meeting
[9:05] place
[9:07] amen so what
[9:10] happened he begin to build
[9:12] this according to the vision and the
[9:15] pattern in
[9:17] heaven amen
[9:19] amen hallelujah and the thing
[9:24] is you can see many points of this
[9:30] but you know that
[9:33] God amen amen he had come down to Moses
[9:37] he had met him in a burning
[9:39] bush he had spoke to him different
[9:43] ways the children of Israel were
[9:45] following the pillar of
[9:47] fire following the cloud God would speak
[9:50] to him is that right all these different
[9:55] forms but then God tells Moses
[10:00] this is in the scripture Amen in Exodus
[10:03] 25 but it tells him you guys are going
[10:07] to build
[10:08] this amen and in and
[10:12] in the Holiness of
[10:15] holies you're going to
[10:19] build a
[10:21] Ark made out of
[10:23] wood and you're going to cover it with
[10:27] gold and in that there you're going to
[10:31] place amen what I'm going to give you
[10:35] upon the
[10:39] mountain what did Moses
[10:42] receive
[10:44] when God met up up on the
[10:48] mount and the unveiling of God
[10:53] 1964 brother says when Moses came on the
[10:57] scene he had the
[10:59] Revelation he had met the pillar of
[11:02] fire it was revealed to
[11:05] Moses how Genesis
[11:08] was he wrote the first four books of the
[11:12] Bible for he met God in the form of the
[11:15] pillar of
[11:17] fire the pillar of fire that
[11:20] veiled he was veiled in the pillar of
[11:23] fire is that right amen that's why
[11:26] brother said that Piller of fire is also
[11:31] the veil of
[11:33] God his Angel is his Veil is that right
[11:38] hallelujah
[11:39] amen see he he he can manifest himself
[11:43] in any
[11:44] form is that right he he can be a man he
[11:49] can be king
[11:51] MZ he can be a
[11:54] bum yeah amen hallelujah amen mhm did St
[11:59] Martin give half of his Coke to a
[12:05] bu that was laying there hungry starving
[12:08] the
[12:09] death with long
[12:11] beard and dirty bum laying there on
[12:15] Street say I'm
[12:17] cold who was
[12:21] that amen hallelujah God can become
[12:24] anything he
[12:26] wants amen hallelujah
[12:30] us look what he says and he says and
[12:35] Paul met
[12:37] him the disciples wrote what they
[12:40] seen the disciples wrote what they seen
[12:45] But Moses had the
[12:47] Revelation Paul had the
[12:49] Revelation he went down into Egypt for
[12:52] three years studi and see the Old
[12:56] Testament amen amen he's think of it
[13:00] the same Pillar of Fire come upon those
[13:04] men in the Bible is the same fire that's
[13:08] here
[13:09] today interpreting the
[13:14] Bible how we thank him for
[13:16] that the
[13:18] same what a
[13:21] comfort what a
[13:23] identification I'm so glad to be
[13:25] identified in
[13:26] that I don't know what to do you I'd
[13:29] rather be identified in that than all of
[13:31] everything
[13:34] else
[13:36] identify in that word the Shina Glory
[13:40] the Revelation
[13:43] leads where the sh
[13:45] glory and the
[13:48] Revelation
[13:50] lay the pillar of fire appearing
[13:55] visibly Among Us
[13:57] Again identifying that the message is
[14:02] right like he did on
[14:05] Mount remember before the true Messenger
[14:09] come
[14:10] forth
[14:12] Moses preached and he led them out of
[14:16] Egypt but
[14:18] before that was
[14:21] before the real
[14:24] Commandments was laid
[14:26] down the seals
[14:29] was brought
[14:30] in God come down before the
[14:33] people and Prov that Moses was sent from
[14:38] him in that Pillar of Fire mes said he
[14:41] had seen him in the burning
[14:43] bush talk to him in this last days same
[14:48] Pillar of Fire is Right Among
[14:50] Us speaking the same word not only that
[14:55] but interpreting it and making it
[14:57] manifest
[14:59] proving it is the truth and people has
[15:03] only has one
[15:05] way to disbelieve it least they just
[15:09] willfully want to disbelieve the
[15:13] word but he that sins
[15:17] willfully after having
[15:20] received the knowledge of the truth
[15:24] there remain no more
[15:27] s for that
[15:30] now
[15:31] notice when this scene
[15:35] unfold amen and God gave
[15:39] Moses hallelujah hallelujah amen there
[15:43] Commandments tables of
[15:46] stone is that
[15:48] right tables of
[15:50] St Hallelujah is what he brought down
[15:55] and he put inside of the
[15:57] Ark is that right is that is where he
[16:02] put what God gave him on the
[16:05] mountain where the prophet of God said
[16:08] here amen he was tying that he was
[16:11] speaking between the lines showing us
[16:15] the same thing has happened in this
[16:17] hour amen that's why Paul said in the
[16:20] scripture amen he
[16:23] prophesied and took the prophecy of
[16:27] Jeremiah and put the prophecy back into
[16:30] the future
[16:32] again just like Peter took the
[16:36] prophecy of
[16:38] Moses and in Deuteronomy
[16:42] 18 and put that prophecy Back to the
[16:44] Future
[16:46] again people don't catch that they just
[16:49] think it was fulfilled in
[16:51] Jesus but Peter in Acts
[16:54] three took the same
[16:56] prophecy Deuteronomy
[17:00] that had already been fulfilled and he
[17:02] said the Lord your God will raise up a
[17:05] prophet like unto me and whosoever
[17:08] doesn't hear that Prophet be cut from
[17:11] the midst of of their
[17:14] Brethren
[17:15] amen what did Paul do he took the
[17:19] prophecy of Jeremiah that said I will
[17:23] make my
[17:24] Covenant with these people I will write
[17:27] my law
[17:30] upon the tables of their
[17:32] heart amen that's why the scripture says
[17:36] I'll change Your Heart of Stone
[17:41] yes because in the Heart of
[17:44] Stone I can't write my laws
[17:47] anymore that was for Moses I wrote my
[17:51] laws upon tables of
[17:54] stone Hallelujah but eel glory to God
[17:59] said and prophesied I'll change your
[18:02] heart of
[18:03] soul and I'll give you a heart of
[18:06] Flesh because Jeremiah had
[18:09] prophesied that he was going to write
[18:11] his
[18:13] laws in the in the
[18:15] tables amen of his people's
[18:18] heart is that right amen and they shall
[18:23] be my people and I will be their God
[18:26] that what the scripture says
[18:28] hallelujah hallelujah so brother and
[18:31] sister that's the reason why this
[18:35] revelation of the open book it's not
[18:39] some literal book it's a
[18:42] revelation that comes into the person
[18:46] that is receiving the open
[18:48] book Hallelujah that's right that's why
[18:51] when brother came out of the
[18:53] mountain he didn't have tablets of
[18:56] stone he didn't have a book
[18:59] amen a
[19:00] scroll that had seven SE and was
[19:03] open oh no no he had a
[19:06] revelation and night after night in that
[19:10] room the angel would come and reveal to
[19:14] him this is the first seal this is the
[19:17] first seal and he would go back to the
[19:20] scripture and look at it through the
[19:23] Bible that what he said he says and I
[19:26] found that and then I would come out and
[19:29] preach it amen amen
[19:33] Revelation do not lay in the
[19:35] mind in the
[19:37] soul hallelujah hallelujah said this is
[19:41] a c I make with my
[19:43] people I will write my
[19:46] laws upon their
[19:49] heart am that right so what did
[19:53] Moses of our
[19:56] day what did he receive a on the
[19:59] mountain the seeds yes and what was to
[20:03] be put into the
[20:06] alt amen hallelujah true

[36:25] came
[36:28] and what did he do he came to
[36:33] restore
[36:35] the yes let's read first
[36:43] king
[36:47] over First
[36:49] Kings read verse 25 look at
[36:53] that and Elijah sent the prophet you one
[36:58] bulock for yourselves and dress it there
[37:00] are many and call on the name of your
[37:02] Gods but put no fire
[37:16] under and they took the bulock which has
[37:19] given them and they dressed and call on
[37:21] the name of Bale from morning until noon
[37:25] say oh hear us they hear us but there
[37:28] was no voice nor any that answered and
[37:30] they leap and jumped the altar which was
[37:49] made
[37:52] amen
[37:54] right now let's go down to verse
[37:58] 29 and it came to pass when midday was
[38:01] passed and they prophesied until the
[38:04] time of the offering of the evening
[38:06] sacrifice that there was neither voice
[38:09] nor any to answer nor any that
[38:23] regarded see I wonder why it doesn't say
[38:27] in the in the
[38:30] Spanish but verse
[38:32] 29 in the in the English it says that
[38:36] until the time of the offering of the

[39:03] me and all the people came near to him

[40:10] names somebody repairing the
[40:13] altar amen he puts there the 12
[40:18] Stones and with the with the stones he
[40:21] he built the
[40:24] altar in the name of the Lord
[40:27] right then he puts all the water and he
