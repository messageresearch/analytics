[10:52] but you can only be a christian if you
[10:54] got the holy ghost inside your souls

[12:37] because he is speaking
[12:39] of something
[12:41] that is not your first person
[12:46] amen
[12:47] that's who he's speaking up that's why
[12:49] because your party
[13:17] this is
[13:32] you're going to get a
[14:13] is
[14:29] five different times single differences
[14:31] why okay it's the spirit of god that is

[15:44] if you're seated there
[15:46] and don't believe it you're not okay and
[15:48] are afraid to move
[15:52] you'll never be
[16:34] the prince and
[16:48] amen
[17:43] he can talk to the church now
[17:57] tonight
[18:41] speak to you
[18:43] the chosen one
[18:44] that he chose before the foundation of
[18:46] the world
[18:48] now
[18:52] for the foundation of the world
[19:22] before
[19:50] that you'd
[20:18] to prepare the
[20:27] hallelujah now this is my church oh this
[20:30] is me so i'm at home now
[20:46] hallelujah
[21:14] amen
[21:28] and put our
[21:56] god
[22:10] to know
[22:50] in the race
[23:20] who's the devil now
[23:22] he's just some stuff
[23:29] to bring children
[23:47] they don't know how good we
[24:16] los angeles
[24:44] really realized
[25:54] we must
[26:06] oh
[26:32] yes
[26:49] a revelation
[27:03] on the scene
[27:29] how could i have chosen
[27:34] no no
[27:36] he chose me hey let's go from me
[27:39] he says amen
[27:42] he chose us
[27:44] in him
[27:46] before the
[28:13] amen only to the predestination
[28:16] only to his thoughts
[28:18] i mean only those that were in him
[28:21] amen
[28:22] chosen in christ
[28:25] in the expressway
[28:28] in the thought express
[28:41] because the fullness
[28:56] because of that
[28:59] this is the reason why
[29:02] amen amen god
[29:05] has
[29:07] said in his word
[29:10] sardis in church age
[29:13] graham explain something here
[29:16] but this is what i want us to see
[29:18] tonight
[29:20] when you when you see
[29:23] amen
[29:24] the grace
[29:51] next hour
[30:20] something that you really are
[30:24] as a person
[30:26] you will always have just a conception
[30:29] of that
[30:32] but you as a person but what
[30:49] so the very fact of who you are
[30:54] in this present life
[30:58] amen
[31:00] by the quickening power of god
[31:13] amen i mean that's why i said
[31:16] to
[31:31] now look what amen
[31:31] says look what he said
[31:34] he says names
[31:36] are going to be blotted out of the book
[31:38] of life
[31:40] no names
[31:43] will be blotted out
[32:26] have
[32:53] and answers on genesis
[34:28] so if you don't have the words
[35:28] until it come
[35:42] comes up
[35:51] is
[36:24] uh
[37:33] do you understand and get the cloud
[38:01] you see in ephesians
[38:15] brought up to heavenly places
[38:58] is
[39:10] through my mistakes
[39:25] what is the holy spirit trying to do
[39:40] where his eternal
[40:08] hallelujah
[40:22] fulfillment
[40:36] didn't make
[41:03] and then teach them some more
[41:18] okay
[41:31] oh
[42:27] hallelujah
[42:36] and that's how when jesus come
[42:39] that's why when jesus comes with a
[42:40] little truth he was born
[42:43] by the incorruptable seed
[42:46] from the mouth
[42:48] of the mouth
[43:22] hallelujah
[43:39] that's why second timothy
[43:42] chapter 2
[43:43] verse 13
[43:45] if we believe not
[43:47] yet he abided faithful
[43:49] because
[43:51] he cannot deny himself
[44:02] hallelujah
[44:34] amen
[44:46] but he is one
[44:48] mind and who can turn him
[44:52] and what his soul desires
[44:55] even that he doesn't
[45:17] break i've got this one
[45:19] let me see let me see if we chose you
[45:21] say this for me can he unchoose you
[45:25] okay
[45:26] yes let's go ahead
[45:44] is
[45:56] is
[46:12] and trespasses
[47:08] just think
[50:37] amen
[51:06] how we
[51:32] not even hopefully
[53:13] amen amen
[53:14] the seed of god
[53:17] christ
[53:19] the cell of god
[53:21] have not been broken yet
[53:25] to give life
[54:22] so brother and sister
[54:24] if we were slain in him
[54:27] we were chosen in him
[54:29] amen amen
[54:31] lord of god
[54:32] we were elected in him
[54:34] when he come to the earth
[54:50] 38
[55:16] hallelujah
[55:31] together
[55:44] foreign
[55:55] hasn't even stopped
[56:55] is
[57:51] is
[58:04] for that age
[58:33] amen
[58:34] he says sometimes he says
[58:36] we joined the church
[58:38] a lot of pretty things in it
[58:41] we try to do pretty ourselves
[58:47] that's good
[58:48] we should
[58:59] but if that's all church means to you
[59:43] and all your
[1:00:26] yes i'll
[1:02:02] of a pretty ecclesiastical birth
[1:02:07] you won't find them
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] come on
[1:02:14] if you find it shown
[1:02:18] it
[1:02:44] that it's because of the word
[1:03:00] another thing is that something in you i
[1:03:03] would deep comes in and that makes you
[1:03:06] alive that i say people make you
[1:03:08] something different if i look i believe
[1:03:10] in what you want
[1:03:13] when a new birth comes in
[1:03:26] of the holy spirit
[1:03:55] as far as the world is concerned
[1:04:10] it'll
[1:04:24] carry on
[1:04:52] out of you
[1:04:54] but you come up from there a different
[1:04:56] purse
[1:04:57] order the spirit of god
[1:05:00] a new creature
[1:05:01] and christ jesus
[1:05:03] it'll do something to you that i don't
[1:05:05] what jesus came
[1:05:48] essence
[1:06:02] hallelujah
[1:06:30] they
[1:06:44] it's that
[1:07:08] hallelujah
[1:07:26] in which you are
[1:08:17] hallelujah
[1:09:05] amen amen oh my father
[1:09:10] and only the bride of christ yes
[1:09:13] yes
[1:09:15] yes
[1:09:57] oh
[1:10:13] this is the message the word
[1:11:09] is
[1:12:06] he says you see what i mean
[1:12:09] if it's spoke by the same thought
[1:12:13] that will materialize the bible
[1:12:19] it brings things
[1:12:33] that was in christ
[1:12:45] if they become expressions
[1:13:02] created the world
[1:13:15] you see what i mean crazy so that same
[1:13:18] spirit as you can see
[1:13:20] that said that
[1:13:22] let there be a letter
[1:13:27] that was in christ
[1:13:43] why do we have to be connected to the
[1:13:44] mind
[1:14:40] i mean let
[1:15:30] you say wait a minute he says
[1:15:33] jesus said have faith in god because he
[1:15:35] goddamn faith your fairly very i said to
[1:15:37] you
[1:15:38] if you say to this about me
[1:15:45] believe what you say will come to pass
[1:15:47] what you're saying
[1:15:48] you shall have it but they're not you
[1:15:50] should have it
[1:16:02] but if it becomes a real true revelation
[1:18:08] hallelujah
[1:18:37] hallelujah
[1:18:50] is
[1:19:06] um
[1:19:19] oh
[1:19:32] what's his mind
[1:19:36] the mind of christ
[1:19:38] is the spirit of
[1:19:40] christ amen
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:20:02] it begins to work
[1:20:14] he says you have the man of christ
[1:20:30] when we don't know
[1:20:32] what he wants to be done with the word
[1:20:36] we'll try to manufacture something
[1:20:40] but we're trying to do something
[1:20:42] or not do something
[1:20:55] but we have to know
[1:20:57] that we know
[1:21:11] that we know
[1:21:26] notice
[1:21:39] will become words
[1:21:54] of the resurrection
[1:22:22] it's on
[1:22:36] mankind
[1:22:37] is
[1:22:39] so away from their cells
[1:22:42] they don't see themselves any longer
[1:22:47] hallelujah hey man whether you got to
[1:22:49] look at the doctor
[1:23:18] yes yes he but he was the seed of god
[1:23:23] and when you come into the mind of
[1:23:24] christ
[1:23:26] he couldn't know if we are going to say
[1:23:28] what god look at the earth from his life
[1:23:32] what he was
[1:24:00] you don't have to do against i said that
[1:24:05] you understand
[1:24:07] if you know
[1:24:09] the god of god
[1:24:11] for your life
[1:24:14] if you don't
[1:24:26] and then you won't know what to do
[1:24:28] anymore
[1:26:18] see
[1:26:20] this is the reason why
[1:26:24] when
[1:26:25] we look
[1:26:27] to what his fulfillment is
[1:26:32] in the word
[1:26:46] that those things questions
[1:27:33] to us was the gospel preached as well as
[1:27:35] unto them but the word preached did not
[1:27:37] profit they have not been mixed with
[1:27:39] faith in them and heard
[1:27:52] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:27:55] rest
[1:27:56] as he says if sworn in my wrath if they
[1:27:59] shall not they if they shall not if they
[1:28:02] shall enter to my rest although the
[1:28:04] works were finished from the foundation
[1:28:07] of the world
[1:29:35] the foundation
[1:29:49] if he's making a certain place at the
[1:29:51] day on this lives that god
[1:29:53] did rest the seventh day from all his
[1:29:55] works
[1:30:02] and in this place again if they shall
[1:30:03] enter into my rest
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:10] see therefore it remained that some
[1:30:11] enter therein and
[1:30:13] they to whom it was first preached
[1:30:15] entered not in because of unbelief
[1:30:33] today after so long with time as i said
[1:30:35] today you shall hear his voice hiding
[1:30:37] out your hearts
[1:30:38] and if jesus had given them the rest
[1:30:40] then would he not afterward have spoken
[1:30:43] of another day
[1:30:45] um
[1:30:59] therefore remains
[1:31:01] there remaining there for a rest to the
[1:31:03] people of god
[1:31:06] for he that is entered into his race
[1:31:10] yet also ceased from his own works
[1:31:13] as god did from
[1:31:57] right
[1:31:58] now you no longer hide me
[1:32:01] but christ
[1:32:05] so it's not your works
[1:32:08] you understand
[1:32:10] you cease from your works
[1:32:13] it's the holy spirit
[1:32:17] amen
[1:32:18] quickening
[1:32:20] the germ the soul
[1:32:23] and it begins to unfold
[1:34:30] by the testimony
[1:34:32] and by the scriptures
[1:34:34] remember sunday night
[1:34:36] what did jesus say
[1:34:38] amen amen
[1:34:40] john what bear witness to me
[1:34:43] hallelujah when we say today
[1:35:12] the sons of god
[1:35:26] hallelujah
[1:35:39] he said the scriptures
[1:35:53] that is born
[1:36:05] hello
