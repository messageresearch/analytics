[6:09] amen that's what the Bible
[6:12] amen refers to repentance to Major
[6:15] Prophets
[6:16] and Minor Prophets
[6:22] Isaiah the prophet he said yes
[6:28] you see what I'm saying in the sixth
[6:32] seals
[6:33] in Isaiah

[7:25] Isaiah
[7:26] I've got a whole lot of more prophets
[7:29] wrote down here
[7:31] he says let's look at Isaiah he said
[7:34] yeah Isaiah is the complete Bible in
[7:37] itself
[7:39] did you know that Isaiah starts with
[7:42] Creations
[7:43] in the middle of the book he brings John
[7:46] every time you go to F1 and he ends he
[7:49] brings the Millennium
[7:51] and the little city
[7:54] all these things and there's 66 books in
[7:58] the Bible
[8:00] says
[8:03] it's a complete encyclopedia itself

[12:27] amen amen so that's where they received
[12:31] that they ran today it was coming down

[12:49] of shepherds labels this is a region
[12:52] amenities
[13:03] verse two okay for those and he said
[13:07] he must want to I'm also one of those

[13:20] and utter his voice
[13:23] from Jerusalem
[13:28] and the habitations of the shepherd
