[16:29] they're not planning to be corrected
[16:30] yeah

[16:43] you can claim to have Revival

[17:08] move of God
[17:14] Amen there must be the correct seat plan
[17:17] today
[17:21] the fruit of the season
[17:26] that's why Jesus said

[20:15] but I want to let you know one time
[20:19] what's wrong
[20:21] and the reason I believe what I believe
[20:26] I believe the devil's deceived you
[20:30] frankly I know
[20:32] according to God's words
[20:36] that's why preach those things the way I
[20:38] do because
[20:39] God's word said it okay
[20:43] this is a different day for anything
[20:45] it's the same word but notice
[20:50] is just the same as he was when when he
[20:54] spoke
[20:55] the only thing is
[20:59] why don't we get the crops it's because
[21:03] we've got the wrong kind of a seeds
[21:07] how many would like to change a letter
[21:10] or some change please
[21:13] and they go from Methodist Pentecost
[21:17] this is to make them twice
[21:20] see
[21:28] notice twice up by the roots
[21:34] Give Me Jesus says every planet that my
[21:39] heavenly father and father says
[21:45] or whatever idea it is
[21:53] every man's word is alive but mine is
[21:55] the truth
[21:57] so come back to your sins
[22:26] the same words
[22:33] if I'm black cucumbers
[22:35] what am I going to get cucumbers see
[22:40] right now if you want a church
[22:45] must have the word of God
[22:48] except the words
[22:54] and if that is the fullness of God
[23:00] it will rain
[23:32] yes
[23:46] listen to the denominations
