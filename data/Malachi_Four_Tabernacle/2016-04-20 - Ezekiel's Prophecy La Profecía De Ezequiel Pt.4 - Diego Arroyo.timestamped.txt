[0:20] presence of the Lord
[0:22] tonight amen and I trust that we come to
[0:25] receive from
[0:26] him amen and I also iting the
[0:32] prayers of all of the saints that God
[0:36] will just make a
[0:39] way I believe he
[0:42] has I don't I don't believe uh we're
[0:45] being led
[0:47] by by what I think
[0:50] or uh it's it's the Holy
[0:53] Spirit and and the message has declared
[0:56] it
[0:57] amen so we're going under
[1:00] that Vision
[1:02] amen under that
[1:04] understanding and we believe that
[1:07] God is still Jehovah
[1:09] Gyra amen and he's going to
[1:12] provide he's going to make a
[1:14] way amen and there's there's there's no
[1:18] uh there's no sense in trying to figure
[1:21] it all
[1:23] out but like
[1:26] Abraham amen he was going
[1:28] somewhere brother bam said he didn't
[1:30] know where he was
[1:32] going but he knew but that God was
[1:35] leading
[1:36] him amen and when he got there amen it
[1:40] was God's provided provided way
[1:44] amen even though he set up a little
[1:47] tent and brother bham says Abraham's
[1:51] tent was a little
[1:54] ripped amen amen that's what the prophet
[1:57] says amen his his cattle was a little
[2:00] was a little
[2:02] skinny amen he his knives were a little
[2:08] rusty amen amen he was having a little
[2:11] hard time out there in the
[2:13] desert amen but it was he was in the
[2:16] will of the
[2:17] Lord amen so whatever the will of the
[2:20] Lord
[2:21] is Amen brother bam said that's the
[2:24] safest place in the
[2:26] world is that right amen the safest
[2:29] place place is to be in his will and I
[2:33] believe that his
[2:34] will is his word amen amen so we can say
[2:40] well I I think this is the will of
[2:43] God but let's see if it's the will of
[2:47] God by the
[2:49] word amen as anybody can say well this
[2:53] is the will of
[2:54] God Amen but God's will brother Ram
[2:57] tells
[2:58] us is his his word amen so we're
[3:02] trusting in
[3:03] that upon the word of God and
[3:07] tomorrow
[3:09] morning uh we'll be
[3:11] leaving to
[3:14] Kentucky flying out
[3:16] amen keep us in
[3:18] prayer we'll be back
[3:21] Saturday to be here Sunday
[3:24] amen trusting that God will just put
[3:27] everything together
[3:31] amen amen so God bless
[3:33] you amen as we open our Bibles God bless
[3:38] you brother
[3:40] Enrique amen precious
[3:43] brother that loves this
[3:46] message Ezekiel
[3:49] 37 as we
[3:51] continue
[3:53] uh I was
[3:56] uh touching on it there Sunday night at
[3:59] at at the
[4:02] end and uh maybe it was the
[4:08] heat amen amen uh we were all a little
[4:14] tired I came out of the service half
[4:19] dead and then
[4:21] uh but uh I believe God is opening this
[4:25] up to
[4:28] us
[4:30] to show
[4:31] us the hour that we're
[4:34] in so we read in Ezekiel
[4:38] 37 and we're going to read from verse
[4:43] n
[4:44] remember that the first
[4:47] part or the yeah the first part of the
[4:52] prophecy that went forth begins in verse
[4:56] seven and then in verse
[4:58] eight he is
[5:01] beholding what the prophecy is
[5:04] doing and
[5:06] after the Lord is performing
[5:10] this there is still a part that is
[5:16] unfulfilled and this is where verse n
[5:19] begins then said he unto me prophesy
[5:23] unto the wind prophesy son of man and
[5:25] say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God
[5:28] come from the Four Winds oh bre and
[5:30] breathe upon these flame that they may
[5:42] live so I prophesied as he has as he
[5:45] commanded me and the breath came into
[5:48] them and they lived and stood up upon
[5:50] their feet in exceeding great
[5:58] Army
[6:00] amen you may be seated may the Lord add
[6:03] the blessing in reading of his
[6:06] word amen if you turn with me to Ezekiel
[6:09] chapter
[6:12] 1 how many have been enjoying this study
[6:15] of
[6:20] Ezekiel I believe it's a it's a real
[6:23] Precious
[6:26] book it's a very perfect type
[6:31] and really the the entire
[6:35] Bible uh in this hour has been
[6:39] revealed the book has been open to show
[6:44] us that the seventh
[6:47] seal which is what's going on
[6:51] now is here throughout the entire
[6:55] Bible in Shadows and
[6:58] types amen amen it's hi throughout the
[7:02] entire
[7:03] Bible in the seventh
[7:05] seal brother bam said this seven
[7:09] seal goes all the way back to
[7:12] Genesis so you can trace
[7:15] it all the way through the Bible but
[7:19] it's
[7:19] hidden in types and
[7:22] shadows amen amen can can we see our day
[7:27] here in the Book of Ezekiel
[7:30] we can see it because the book has been
[7:34] open the symbols have been
[7:37] revealed amen the prophet has come with
[7:40] thus sayeth the
[7:42] Lord the highest
[7:44] order to reveal the word which is the
[7:48] highest thing there
[7:50] is the word is the highest order there
[7:54] is and the prophet is the highest order
[7:58] to reveal that
[8:00] word amen and when that word is
[8:04] revealed brother benam said it took the
[8:07] third
[8:09] pool to reveal that
[8:12] word amen and we see that that power of
[8:17] that
[8:19] Revelation has opened the Bible to
[8:22] us has opened the
[8:25] scriptures amen where brother Bram said
[8:28] if you can't find
[8:30] Christ in every in every story in every
[8:35] chapter in every verse of the Bible he
[8:39] said go back and read it
[8:41] again because Christ is in there amen
[8:45] and where Christ
[8:47] is amen his bride
[8:49] is amen and where Christ is the
[8:53] messenger for the
[8:55] age that was going to introduce Christ
[8:59] is represented somewhere in
[9:02] there amen was was was Isaac a type of
[9:06] Christ was elzer type of the seventh
[9:10] angel was Rebecca type of the
[9:13] Bride amen amen was Boaz a type of
[9:18] Christ amen was the chief
[9:22] Reaper of of boaz's
[9:25] field a type of the seventh
[9:28] angel amen was was Ruth a type of the
[9:32] Bride see it's all over the Bible you
[9:36] can't miss it but it had it's hidden in
[9:39] there but in this day brother bam said
[9:43] all of that was speaking of this
[9:47] Hallelujah am and that's the
[9:50] beauty of getting into a book like
[9:54] this like Ezekiel and be able by the
[9:58] message
[10:00] and the hope of the Holy
[10:02] Spirit to see
[10:05] clearly what what prophecy is in
[10:08] there because the Bible is a book of
[10:12] Prophecy brother bam said other books
[10:16] like the
[10:17] Quran and other books he says there
[10:21] there's books of code of
[10:25] ethics amen there's books that that show
[10:29] you you know how to be a good
[10:32] person he said but there's no book like
[10:34] the
[10:36] Bible this book is a book of
[10:39] Prophecy hallelujah hallelujah and that
[10:42] book
[10:44] reveals Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[10:48] Revelation Christ is revealed in
[10:51] Genesis Christ is revealed in
[10:53] Exodus Christ is revealed in
[10:56] Leviticus amen amen It's The End entire
[11:00] revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen and
[11:05] it shows us that Christ is
[11:08] revealed in his own
[11:10] word didn't brother Brandon preach a
[11:14] message Christ revealed in his own word
[11:19] he says the way I got
[11:21] that some somebody gave me a a beautiful
[11:26] picture of Christ uh Hoffman's head of
[11:31] Christ at 33 he says but the
[11:35] painting was all of the
[11:39] Beatitudes of Jesus in Matthew 5 on on
[11:42] on on on the
[11:45] mountain The Sermon on the Mount he says
[11:48] and the
[11:49] artist that that made that he says
[11:53] wherever he wanted to make the
[11:57] outline of the the figure of Christ's
[12:01] head he said he would press on the on
[12:04] the pencil
[12:07] harder amen and and where he was outside
[12:10] of the
[12:11] head because he was writing all the
[12:15] scriptures but where he wanted to make
[12:17] Christ
[12:19] figure he would press
[12:22] harder and when it was outside of that
[12:25] he would make it
[12:26] light and brother bam says
[12:29] that's where I got the
[12:31] inspiration Christ revealed in his own
[12:36] word amen
[12:39] amen and that right
[12:42] there
[12:43] showed brother bam said in that
[12:46] message he says Christ in order to be
[12:50] revealed he says there had to be
[12:53] light to come and shine so that we could
[12:58] see Christ
[13:00] and that's what the message
[13:01] is amen it shall be light in the evening
[13:05] time amen that light was going to
[13:09] reveal amen Christ hallelujah hallelujah
[13:14] when we see that brother Braham says in
[13:16] that
[13:17] message he says for
[13:20] ages they've walked in
[13:22] darkness he says they they were touching
[13:25] around trying to get
[13:27] around am amen he says but when someone
[13:31] turns on the
[13:32] light you can see
[13:34] clearly he says maybe in the
[13:37] darkness you can't see what it is he
[13:40] says but when you turn it on you see
[13:43] exactly what it
[13:44] is and that's that's what this message
[13:47] come to
[13:48] do to
[13:50] reveal all of the hidden
[13:52] things amen they could they could read
[13:55] the Bible but they couldn't really
[13:58] understand
[14:00] it it was still
[14:01] dark it was still kind of
[14:04] blurry they couldn't really understand
[14:06] what it was all
[14:08] about but when light come shine on the
[14:12] Bible to show
[14:15] exactly what it was speaking of and it
[14:18] couldn't be until the last
[14:20] time as he
[14:22] promised amen amen so Ezekiel
[14:26] 37 we see that he prophesied for the
[14:29] second
[14:31] time only a
[14:34] recycling of the same prophecy going out
[14:37] again amen a
[14:40] repeat of the same prophecy going
[14:44] forth is that right we all know what
[14:46] that is right amen amen so Ezekiel
[14:50] chapter
[14:52] 1 we read here from verse
[14:57] two in the fifth day of the month which
[15:00] was the fifth year of King jeah Kim's
[15:09] captivity the word of the Lord came
[15:13] expressly unto Ezekiel the
[15:17] priest amen amen the son of
[15:21] boozy in the land of the Chans by the
[15:25] river
[15:26] chabar and the Hand of the Lord was
[15:28] there upon
[15:39] Him amen so we see that
[15:42] Ezekiel was not only a
[15:46] prophet he was a he was a
[15:49] priest amen are we Kings and Priests in
[15:51] this
[15:53] hour amen amen
[15:55] Ezekiel
[15:57] interceded as a priest for the whole
[16:01] house of
[16:02] Israel amen he was in
[16:05] intercession and as a prophet he gave
[16:09] warning of the Judgment of God is that
[16:13] right God cannot bring
[16:16] judgment without first
[16:18] warning and brother bam says amen the
[16:23] sign of God the greatest sign is a
[16:28] prophet
[16:29] on the scene giving
[16:32] warning that judgment is
[16:34] coming amen is that is that our message
[16:39] Malachi before the great and Dreadful
[16:41] day of the
[16:42] Lord I'll s
[16:44] Elijah amen and he's going to do
[16:47] something with his Prophecy with the
[16:50] seven
[16:51] Thunders he's going to turn the
[16:53] hearts of the children living in this
[16:56] day back to the faith of the the fathers
[17:00] because there's coming judgment but
[17:02] first the
[17:03] warning is a message to prepare the
[17:08] people and make a way of
[17:10] Escape brother bam says in the days of
[17:13] Noah there was a
[17:16] prophet as a sign that judgment's coming
[17:20] and the prophet was saying get in the
[17:22] ark judgment's coming get in the ark
[17:26] judgment is coming and those who obeyed
[17:28] that
[17:29] message found God's way of
[17:32] escape and were're safe from the
[17:34] Judgment of
[17:35] God and in this hour is no
[17:38] different amen amen before the great and
[17:41] Dreadful day of the
[17:43] Lord I'll send Elijah and that message
[17:47] is going to make a way of Escape for my
[17:51] children because the seven Thunder is
[17:54] going to give rapturing fith hallelujah
[17:57] hallelujah that's the only way out the
[18:00] only way to escape the judgments that
[18:03] are coming is a Rapture hallelujah
[18:06] hallelujah and God has given us a
[18:09] message with seven Thunders to raise our
[18:13] faith and get out of here in God's way
[18:17] of Escape before the Judgment
[18:20] stri brother bam says before one
[18:24] bomb can fall
[18:27] bride will have to be gone now I don't
[18:31] care if Putin's in
[18:33] Russia I don't care what the world is

[18:50] bride amen hallelujah glory to God

[18:56] message behold
[18:59] I seen you I seen you I seen you Elijah
[19:04] the prophet amen amen he send it to the
[19:08] bride predestinated seed to make a way
[19:13] of Escape for his children Noah and his
[19:19] family amen no one else just his
[19:24] family how many are part of the
[19:27] family
[19:28] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[19:31] Hallelujah the family in
[19:33] heaven and the family on Earth has a
[19:37] name the name of Jesus
[19:40] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and that
[19:43] family amen amen has different has has a
[19:47] great
[19:48] album amen and we can look in the family
[19:53] album and say well look at my brother
[19:56] Ezekiel hallelujah hallelujah he he he's
[19:59] he he's my he's my far away
[20:02] brother that lived a long time ago but
[20:05] but but he's part of the
[20:08] family glory to God he stood for the
[20:12] word amen amen I can see his example I
[20:16] can see his faith I can see his
[20:19] conviction I can see how God dealt with
[20:22] him and say that's my family
[20:26] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed be
[20:29] the
[20:31] God Amen so we
[20:34] see that Ezekiel was not only a a pre a
[20:39] prophet he was a
[20:42] priest and in verse
[20:44] four it says and I
[20:46] looked and
[20:48] behold
[20:50] amen a worldwind oh
[20:54] my came out of the
[20:56] North a a great
[21:01] Cloud amen amen and a
[21:05] fire infolding
[21:08] itself wow and a brightness was about it
[21:13] and out of the midst thereof the color
[21:15] of
[21:16] amber out of the midst of the
[21:27] fire
[21:38] look at
[21:39] Ezekiel the reason I turned to the
[21:42] scripture is because I want to continue
[21:44] a little bit
[21:46] tonight on the Four
[21:49] Winds it was it was maybe a
[21:52] little a little bit hard on
[21:57] Sunday to
[22:00] catch what what this what what the Lord
[22:02] is trying to show
[22:04] us in these Four
[22:07] Winds it is one wind remember that how
[22:09] many remember
[22:11] that Ezekiel
[22:14] 379 it says prophesy to the
[22:19] wind
[22:21] singular amen amen and the
[22:26] wind when it comes com it comes from the
[22:30] Four
[22:31] Winds see and it
[22:36] breathes upon the
[22:40] slain amen and they
[22:42] live and they raise up a mighty marching
[22:46] Army well when we go to Ezekiel
[22:50] 1 and we see this verse four right
[22:53] here he says that in this
[22:56] vision of
[22:59] God
[23:03] Amen verse one says he saw visions of
[23:11] God right but what did he see the
[23:14] heavens
[23:18] opened so in verse four it shows
[23:23] us that a
[23:26] whirlwind came out of the
[23:28] North see a
[23:35] whirlwind amen when Four
[23:40] Winds
[23:42] see meet in the same
[23:47] place amen coming from four different
[23:52] directions amen amen it creates a
[23:56] whirlwind
[23:58] amen hallelujah because the
[24:01] wind is coming from four
[24:06] directions from the north from the south
[24:09] from the East and from the
[24:12] west and it's
[24:14] coming in one
[24:17] place where this
[24:19] body that has already been
[24:24] restored up to a third phase of it
[24:28] by the prophecy it's already been
[24:32] scattered but it's been brought or
[24:34] United
[24:36] together the Bones have come together
[24:40] the Senus have come upon it the skin is
[24:44] upon it it's a
[24:46] body but it's laying
[24:49] dead there's no life in it there's
[24:52] nothing there amen
[24:56] amen so this this
[24:59] wind is coming from four
[25:04] directions in one
[25:06] place where the body
[25:08] is amen right M now
[25:13] notice it says and I looked and behold
[25:15] the Whirlwind came out of the
[25:21] North a great cloud and a fire unfolding
[25:26] itself now
[25:31] I
[25:34] was mentioning Sunday
[25:37] night what this Breath of
[25:41] God
[25:44] means according to the
[25:46] message according to the
[25:48] scriptures is that right how many
[25:51] remember that Hallelujah that that
[25:54] Breath of
[25:56] God Amen is a power of the fullness of
[26:02] God which is going to place the
[26:06] body in the mature stage of
[26:12] adoption which is the fourth
[26:15] stage which brother bam said is Son of
[26:19] Man
[26:21] justification
[26:23] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[26:25] Spirit and adoption
[26:28] there's a fourth
[26:30] stage how many remembers brother Bram
[26:33] telling his mother's dream in the
[26:35] message it is the rising of the
[26:40] Sun and he said that Pentecostal
[26:43] woman uh in the dream brother bam was
[26:47] preaching telling the people they must
[26:50] come up three
[26:52] steps amen amen and he
[26:55] said that he he says uh he was showing
[26:59] them there was three steps they had to
[27:01] come
[27:02] up and brother man said that's exactly
[27:04] my
[27:06] message I was preaching the three stages
[27:09] of
[27:10] Grace in the
[27:12] dream and he said in this in this
[27:15] Pentecostal
[27:17] woman amen came up with some big old
[27:20] high
[27:22] heels amen amen and
[27:25] said well
[27:28] I'm going to go up these three
[27:30] steps the prophet told her in the
[27:33] dream sister you can't go up those steps
[27:37] with those high heels
[27:39] on amen amen and she laughed turned
[27:43] around to the West rest of the churches
[27:45] I mean
[27:47] women amen amen and told the rest of the
[27:51] churches you don't have to
[27:54] listen to that crazy
[27:56] man
[27:59] that's right correct that's
[28:03] symbolic because a woman represents the
[28:06] church one Church telling other
[28:09] churches you don't have to listen to
[28:13] this crazy
[28:14] man and and she said I I'll show you
[28:18] that that I can go up to three
[28:20] steps with these high heels and I don't
[28:24] have to listen to
[28:25] him see
[28:28] and and brother B said in the
[28:30] dream she went one up
[28:32] step two steps three
[28:37] steps what did he say that
[28:40] represented amen amen the three stages
[28:43] of
[28:44] Grace that's what he said it
[28:46] represented and he said she come up to
[28:49] the top and turn around said see I told
[28:53] you all I can be justified sanctified
[28:58] and baptized with the Holy
[28:59] Ghost and not have to listen to him and
[29:03] brother said she began to
[29:06] walk and the and the path up on the on
[29:09] top of the three steps there was a great
[29:14] Highway amen and it began to get
[29:17] narrow and she couldn't walk no more
[29:19] with those high
[29:21] heels when it got real narrow amen amen
[29:25] and she fell off brother Braham said the
[29:28] most her mother told him the most
[29:30] horrible
[29:34] screams amen that woman falling into
[29:41] hell uh I don't think that needs any
[29:46] interpretation it's pretty
[29:48] plain so the fourth
[29:52] stage in this
[29:54] hour is
[29:56] required amen a lot of people in the
[29:59] message don't want to even get into
[30:04] that but the thing
[30:07] is perfection is
[30:10] required in this age maybe not in
[30:14] the amen amen maybe not in Wesley's day
[30:18] Wesley or
[30:19] Luther's amen amen but in this age
[30:23] there's got to be
[30:26] adoption this is that
[30:30] dispensation this is that
[30:32] hour amen amen well how is it
[30:36] possible there was a man in our
[30:39] day that showed us it was
[30:42] possible amen he reached
[30:47] maturity oh but he was a
[30:50] prophet but he was a son
[30:53] too and he had to grow too and he had to
[30:57] learn learn
[30:58] too amen and he had to come to a
[31:01] maturity
[31:02] too amen amen yes
[31:06] sir so when we
[31:10] see that three
[31:12] stages were already in these uh bones of
[31:18] Ezekiel or the
[31:20] vision then the fourth
[31:24] stage amen amen was still
[31:28] needed and according to the fourth
[31:31] stage as we have just
[31:34] mentioned what is it adoption right amen
[31:40] all right I'm making it simple like that
[31:42] so you can
[31:44] understand and brother bam tells
[31:46] us in restoration of the brid
[31:49] tree amen amen he tells us
[31:55] here he said four messengers of
[32:00] death amen destroyed it took it
[32:05] away killed it in dogas four messengers
[32:09] of
[32:10] righteousness Resto restore her back
[32:14] again then he says
[32:17] prophesy son of man can these bones
[32:22] live he says I wish we had
[32:25] time I got it wrote down here but I have
[32:29] to miss that so brother bam had
[32:33] notes that he wanted he he he wanted to
[32:36] bring out more of
[32:38] this ezekiel's
[32:40] bones watch he says I he says I got it
[32:43] wrote down here I wish I had time but I
[32:48] have to miss
[32:49] that amen prophesy can these bones
[32:54] liveu he says what's the four
[33:00] stages that coming forth of that
[33:04] church is that's what the four
[33:09] stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming
[33:15] for see four stages of the church coming
[33:20] to full
[33:22] maturity he is talking about the bride
[33:25] tree remember it was the same
[33:28] insect in four different
[33:32] stages how many know that the bride tree
[33:36] was born at
[33:38] Pentecost hallelujah hallelujah and when
[33:41] it was born it was the
[33:44] tree amen was for seven Church you got
[33:48] it right for seven Church
[33:51] ages hallelujah hallelujah there was a
[33:54] tree amen amen but brother bam said four
[33:59] insects or one
[34:02] insect in four
[34:04] stages he also was a a a
[34:11] metamorphosizing right amen amen amen
[34:15] from a
[34:17] caterpillar to a Palmer worm to a canker
[34:21] worm right but it was the same old
[34:25] devil
[34:27] brother and sister look at Revelation
[34:30] chapter
[34:31] 6 Amen brother bam said the spirit of
[34:37] antichrist John speaks of it in his
[34:40] epistle first John chapter
[34:43] 4 amen we have heard that the spirit of
[34:47] the
[34:48] Antichrist was to come and he says it's
[34:51] here
[34:52] now Amen brother Ram said first the Holy
[34:56] Ghost
[34:57] came and brought forth a brid
[35:00] tree amen
[35:02] amen he said but
[35:04] [Music]
[35:06] four and messengers of death The Same
[35:10] Spirit Antichrist Spirit changing in
[35:15] four different
[35:16] forms killed
[35:18] completely the tree is that right took
[35:22] away its leaves took away the fruit took
[35:26] away the leaves took away the
[35:29] bark amen amen and cut it
[35:32] down until it was just a stump
[35:35] left but Joel chapter 2
[35:38] says I will
[35:41] restore sayth the Lord all the
[35:45] years 2,000
[35:49] years that that these four messengers of
[35:53] death all of the years that the Locust
[35:57] caterpillar canker worm worm I will
[36:02] restore say the
[36:04] Lord amen amen so notice when the
[36:08] Antichrist Spirit went
[36:10] out brother said it was the Antichrist
[36:13] on the White
[36:15] Horse amen he had an arc but with no
[36:22] Arrow amen he had a bow but no no Arrow
[36:27] hallelujah amen amen glory to
[36:31] God brother said amen that's Matthew
[36:37] 2424 close they could dece the very
[36:41] elect he he he he represents
[36:44] Purity he's religious he's
[36:47] clean amen amen but then the same devil
[36:52] turned into his Doctrine and and and and
[36:57] if you didn't believe his
[36:58] Doctrine he killed you and the White
[37:02] Horse turned
[37:04] red it was the same devil amen but then
[37:08] it from Red he turned
[37:11] black glory to God and from black he
[37:13] turned
[37:14] pale and brother Bram said The Pale
[37:18] Horse killed the Pentecostal
[37:21] church and she's dead and brother Bram
[37:24] said thus sayith the Lord
[37:27] she'll never rise
[37:31] again killed the
[37:34] church but brother he didn't
[37:37] promise to
[37:39] resurrect the Pentecostal
[37:42] organization or to
[37:44] restore the organizational
[37:47] system he promised to
[37:50] restore a bride tree and brother Ram
[37:54] said you know what he said he said
[37:56] that's the Tree of
[37:59] Life Hallelujah Glory you can go over to
[38:02] the Book of
[38:04] Revelation and John was in the New
[38:07] Jerusalem he says I saw the Tree of Life
[38:11] one on one side of the river and one on
[38:14] the other side of the
[38:15] river one tree of life one on one side
[38:20] and one on the other side hallelujah
[38:22] hallelujah the two are
[38:25] one of God
[38:28] hallelujah now
[38:30] notice
[38:31] why why did we touch that there because
[38:36] there's four
[38:38] stages amen amen but what did God
[38:42] use to
[38:44] combat each one of those horse
[38:49] riders amen amen or each one of those
[38:52] Powers same horse
[38:54] rider amen amen amen same horse just
[38:59] changing
[39:00] color but what did he
[39:02] use amen the the
[39:05] lion right amen he used the ox he used
[39:10] the man and he used the eagle
[39:13] power is that
[39:15] right so the first four
[39:18] seals reveals to you the
[39:22] history of seven Church
[39:25] ages 2,000 years the first four
[39:29] seals the fourth
[39:31] seal is the
[39:33] same as the seven
[39:36] seal yes sir because it is in mystery
[39:41] form amen amen now
[39:44] watch when we see
[39:47] then that it was four powers of
[39:51] God four anointings of
[39:54] God to come against
[39:57] amen
[39:58] amen
[40:00] this Antichrist
[40:03] Spirit brother Bram
[40:06] says that
[40:08] Satan listen now how we're how we're
[40:11] dividing
[40:13] this that
[40:15] Satan is the prince of the power of the
[40:18] air amen amen and in Revelation chapter
[40:22] 7 there's an angel that rises from the
[40:27] East with the Seal of God in his
[40:30] forehead and he
[40:32] tells to the Four
[40:34] Angels hold the Four
[40:37] Winds brother Bram
[40:40] said Satan is the prince of the power of
[40:43] the he said in the message the Seal of
[40:46] God he says in those Four
[40:49] Winds I'm trying to separate so you can
[40:52] see
[40:53] something those Four Winds going to blow
[40:56] on the
[40:57] Earth are not the Four
[41:00] Winds of Ezekiel
[41:04] 37 the Four
[41:06] Winds of Revelation chapter
[41:09] 7 are four
[41:11] winds that are are coming
[41:15] together listen the Four Winds are going
[41:18] to blow all at
[41:21] once all four of them at one time
[41:25] brother bam said what does that
[41:28] create
[41:30] Armageddon amen he said those four wi
[41:35] have never blown on the
[41:37] earth they were hold
[41:39] back in the first World
[41:42] War I believe it was
[41:46] 1914 to 1918 something
[41:49] like amen I'm speaking to a a war
[41:54] historian here
[41:58] amen amen so brother bam said first
[42:02] world war
[42:05] ended in the 11th
[42:08] month on the 11th
[42:12] day on the 11th
[42:14] Hour glory to God and no one know how it
[42:18] stopped he says it was that angel Christ
[42:22] that held back the Winds of God I I mean
[42:26] the winds which is which is
[42:30] Wars and strife brother said if those
[42:33] winds wouldn't have been held
[42:36] back amen from the first world
[42:39] war wouldn't have been no
[42:42] second it would have went to
[42:45] Armageddon so that shows you that those
[42:48] Four
[42:49] Winds
[42:50] together combined not just one win not
[42:55] just two wins
[42:56] four together will make
[43:00] Armageddon you
[43:02] understand now
[43:04] notice Satan is an
[43:08] imitator he's an
[43:09] imitator because he he has used
[43:13] also four
[43:16] powers amen he's used the White
[43:20] Horse he's used the red
[43:23] horse amen the the black and the
[43:27] pale see it's one Spirit of the
[43:31] devil but he uses different
[43:34] forms he he he uses
[43:37] religious see holy
[43:39] white he also uses another form I'll
[43:43] kill you if you don't believe like
[43:45] me like C amen amen see he killed Abel
[43:51] why because he didn't worship like he
[43:54] worship that's the red horse
[43:57] but the White Horse was the
[43:59] serpent speaking to Eve seducing her you
[44:04] see the different
[44:05] stages amen and then you see the black
[44:08] horse with Nimrod Gathering the
[44:12] wealth all of those things are in
[44:14] Genesis amen White Horse red horse black
[44:18] horse and then the Pale Horse the angel
[44:21] of death in the days of Moses in Egypt a
[44:26] Pale Horse so so in Genesis and in
[44:30] Exodus you see the four
[44:32] horses you see the serpent you see Cain
[44:36] you see Nimrod and you see Pharaoh
[44:40] bringing the angel of
[44:42] death amen but every time there was a
[44:47] power of God to combat
[44:50] that is that right when the serpent
[44:53] begal
[44:54] Eve Jehovah came down and spoke a lamb
[44:58] into
[44:59] existence and covered them when Cain
[45:02] killed
[45:03] Abel he rose up set and they began to
[45:07] Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[45:10] when when Nimrod came oh brother he sent
[45:15] judgments glory to God hallelujah
[45:18] hallelujah and brother said God brought
[45:20] out
[45:22] Abraham out of that out of that system
[45:27] Glory he sent an earthquake the Bible
[45:30] says in Genesis 11 and he
[45:34] shook amen amen the Tower of
[45:38] Babel
[45:39] Hallelujah yes sir and in the days of
[45:44] the Pale Horse there was a prophet with
[45:47] the power of the spoken
[45:49] word Glory that he would speak amen and
[45:54] fleas would come to
[45:57] he would speak and frogs would come
[45:59] forth glory to God and then he spoke and
[46:03] he said place the
[46:06] token amen amen this is the spirit of
[46:09] the eagle the prophet Moses combating
[46:14] the spirit of the Pale Horse that's the
[46:19] Bible is't it the same thing in this
[46:23] hour yes sir amen so when you
[46:27] see that Satan
[46:29] too amen has used these four
[46:33] powers see but
[46:37] Armageddon see this tribulation that is
[46:41] coming three years and a
[46:44] half is that right but after that
[46:49] tribulation amen amen there's an
[46:53] Armageddon yes
[46:54] sir
[46:58] Armageddon is to usher in the
[47:03] Millennium amen amen this is where the
[47:07] great
[47:08] judgments of God are going to
[47:11] fall the Earth is going to be
[47:14] purged fire is going to
[47:17] burn amen from the earth from the
[47:21] heavens amen and from atomic fire yes
[47:26] sir amen volcanic
[47:29] lava is going to burst out of the
[47:32] earth amen amen Brimstone and fire is
[47:38] going to fall from Heaven all of these
[47:41] things is coming in that
[47:44] time but
[47:46] notice the four powers of
[47:49] God together is the same
[47:53] thing see but this is
[47:56] bringing a
[47:58] purging a cleansing to establish his
[48:03] kingdom in this
[48:06] earth Hallelujah you see the
[48:09] Millennium is going to establish a
[48:11] literal
[48:12] Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah but this
[48:16] these seven angels hallelujah hallelujah
[48:19] bring four
[48:22] anointing see because in each Church age
[48:26] there was sending an
[48:27] angel amen and out of the Seven Angels

[48:33] anointings Amen to all Seven
[48:36] Ages you

[50:14] to come at the End of the
[50:17] Age amen the
[50:20] fullness of these four

[51:46] Cloud see when the
[51:48] fullness of those Four Winds
[51:52] meet see it makes a great great
[51:56] Cloud what's in this picture here how
[51:59] many
[52:00] know that after brother Bram was
[52:03] received the revelation of
[52:06] this and he and he saw it in the Life
[52:10] Magazine he told it to the
[52:13] Tabernacle and he told us what this was
[52:16] seven angels
[52:19] 63 he told us seven angels he kept
[52:22] telling us seven angels like this seven
[52:27] angels seven angels amen this is the
[52:31] earth we looking up and this is what you
[52:34] see seven angels seven angels amen
[52:40] 64 still
[52:42] saying seven angels and it's
[52:45] true seven angels but it wasn't until
[52:50] 65 amen amen two years later that the
[52:54] Holy Spirit one
[52:56] day told him turn the picture to the
[53:00] right two years
[53:02] later not in
[53:04] 63 no no no not in
[53:06] 64 in
[53:08] 65 he told him turn it to the
[53:12] right see he was seeing seven
[53:15] angels see it's
[53:19] correct but the third the
[53:22] seven the seven
[53:25] turn into
[53:27] one
[53:29] amen Christ in which was the
[53:33] fullness of the godhead
[53:35] body Hallelujah you understand
[53:39] Hallelujah the
[53:42] seven
[53:44] separated Through the Ages was a portion
[53:47] of the Holy
[53:48] Spirit each age but together they make
[53:53] they make the fullness
[53:56] yes of the godhead
[53:59] bod in him
[54:02] dwelt all
[54:04] fullness the mystery of
[54:06] godliness God was manifested in flesh is
[54:09] that right
[54:11] amen so the
[54:14] seven make
[54:16] one brother bam said in the
[54:19] beginning in the great
[54:22] invisible Elohim El self
[54:25] existing he said the first thing that
[54:27] come out of
[54:28] him was a
[54:31] rainbow he said seven spirits of God he
[54:35] said red come out amen amen he said then
[54:39] orange come
[54:41] out green come out Indigo purple all of
[54:46] these come out seven
[54:48] colors and he tells us what each color
[54:51] means he said red the love that's what
[54:55] he said he said blue is
[55:00] tress amen amen the truth is blue and he
[55:05] began to tell us what these colors
[55:07] were but he said the seven
[55:10] rainbows to the seven colors together
[55:15] make the pillar of
[55:16] fire
[55:18] Hallelujah and in that is the fullness
[55:22] of God that's the word
[55:25] you understand all
[55:27] right
[55:29] so watch
[55:32] this four stages right brother Bram says
[55:37] watch the four stages coming forth
[55:41] what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[55:43] bones coming
[55:46] forth in other words he he's he's
[55:48] connecting
[55:50] it God restoring the bride
[55:53] tree and four
[55:56] stages what putting the the the the bark
[55:59] back
[56:00] on right amen putting the leaves back
[56:05] on amen amen and then brother B said
[56:07] what's the third
[56:09] stage putting the fruit back
[56:12] on amen amen but the fourth
[56:16] stage is the fruit on the top of the
[56:20] tree receiving
[56:22] maturity always the fourth stage
[56:26] speaks of
[56:27] adoption maturity Perfection amen amen
[56:33] fullness see GL so then he connects it
[56:36] with the bones of
[56:38] Ezekiel he says that he tells us that
[56:42] there's four
[56:43] stages he says see the
[56:46] bones the
[56:48] S the skin was upon
[56:51] them but when the wind blowed upon them
[56:56] that's when come back the fourth message
[57:00] of
[57:04] life it's a message of
[57:07] life I will restore sayith the
[57:10] Lord when the wind came he
[57:15] says when the wind
[57:17] blew that wind is the fourth
[57:21] stage
[57:23] Hallelujah understand Amen brother what
[57:27] is the
[57:28] message is the
[57:30] sounding of the seventh angel's
[57:33] trumpet and brother Bram said Revelation
[57:37] 107 that when the seventh angel begins
[57:41] to sound the
[57:43] trumpet at the
[57:45] opening of The Seven
