[9:47] mypl the Lord have the blessing the
[9:49] reading of his
[9:51] word may be
[9:58] seated
[10:08] now God bless each and every one of
[10:12] you we
[10:16] have seen very
[10:20] tremendously already how
[10:28] that we are in another book of Acts
[10:35] today we
[10:37] are in this
[10:42] time exactly in that
[10:46] position in that
[10:51] place according to the
[10:54] word after Elijah and the son of man
[11:00] and before the Roman
[11:03] system comes to destroy and
[11:08] kill everything that does not receive
[11:11] its
[11:12] Mark the number of a
[11:15] man
[11:17] sits in
[11:19] thatone Satan will be the
[11:27] head and as we seen this
[11:33] Friday that image to the
[11:35] Beast is given power to
[11:39] speak Revelation
[11:42] 13
[11:44] 42
[11:47] months
[11:50] hallelujah hallelujah chapter 11 of
[11:57] Revelation speaks of us of the
[12:04] Gentiles trotting upon
[12:08] Jerusalem
[12:11] coming in that
[12:15] territory to
[12:17] bring
[12:20] persecution not
[12:22] only on the
[12:26] Jews the whole world
[12:32] Bible said it is given to
[12:36] the
[12:40] city and they shall tread underf foot 40
[12:44] two
[12:48] months and then it
[12:50] says that God is going to
[12:53] give power unto Moses and
[12:57] Elijah
[13:02] for
[13:03] 1,260
[13:07] days going to give power unto
[13:10] them that this Roman
[13:13] system be not able to
[13:17] interrupt God's
[13:20] program when they are finished with
[13:23] it when their time of prophesying has
[13:27] ended
[13:31] then they are killed and
[13:34] Slaughter that shows us that Satan
[13:38] brother bam
[13:39] said has no right to take
[13:43] you death has no more
[13:45] power over the Sons and Daughters of
[13:49] God unless God
[13:52] permits God ain't finished with
[13:55] you God has a work for you to do
[14:08] when they finish
[14:11] prophesying
[14:13] 1,260
[14:16] days which is the same 42
[14:23] months in the Hebrew
[14:26] calendar a month is 30 days
[14:32] amen so if it's 30 in one
[14:36] month 42
[14:39] months is 30 *
[14:44] 42 30 *
[14:46] 42 is
[14:48] a00
[14:52] 200 amen two
[14:57] witnesses are going to be
[15:00] ministering during the same
[15:03] time at this Beast of
[15:06] Revelations
[15:08] 13 image to
[15:10] the
[15:13] speak that shows you we seen Friday
[15:18] brother bam said in uniting time
[15:20] and that when Titus the Roman general
[15:24] came this this book of Acts this Alpha
[15:28] bride
[15:30] was not
[15:31] CAU in that slaughtering that killing
[15:40] amenu Hallelujah was not they were
[15:45] not that's a perfect Shadow and
[15:51] tipe of this Omega bride in this
[15:56] hour amen that will not go into those 42
[16:02] months it will not go into those 1,200
[16:06] and 60
[16:08] days amen it will not go into when that
[16:12] image to the Beast is given power to
[16:18] speak because Satan is just an
[16:21] imitator amen he makes his image and he
[16:26] gives his image breath
[16:29] and then that image that receives
[16:34] breath begins to speak
[16:37] amenu just
[16:40] anator because the bride is to be the
[16:44] image of
[16:45] Christ and she is to receive the Breath
[16:48] of God the Holy
[16:51] Spirit and when you and I as His
[16:55] Image receive that breath will begin to
[16:59] speak
[17:02] too it's
[17:07] just you see but the bride will not go
[17:11] through that
[17:12] time she'll be freed from that because
[17:16] the Holy Spirit the power of
[17:19] God not National
[17:22] Force but the holy
[17:24] spirit will force us upward amen to the
[17:30] Rapture that be the power of
[17:33] God take us away
[17:37] amen this Omega Bride of the book of act
[17:42] will not go or will not enter will not
[17:46] be
[17:48] C by this Roman
[17:54] system we seen how
[17:57] Titus
[18:00] he United the
[18:03] nation United the
[18:07] armies he had gained
[18:11] power he had
[18:13] come to
[18:16] destroy to
[18:23] annihilate this
[18:25] movement God had Rose
[18:29] amen and as brother Bram
[18:32] says behind every movement of
[18:36] God
[18:40] fanaticism he said it's not a a miracle
[18:44] how that Luther could protest the
[18:47] Catholic
[18:51] church amen but the miracle was the
[18:55] great thing was how he could hold his
[18:58] head above
[19:01] water with all the
[19:04] fanaticism that followed his
[19:06] message
[19:08] amenu because people in the name of
[19:10] Luther's
[19:12] message they killed Catholic
[19:16] priests in the name of Luther's
[19:19] message they burned Catholic
[19:22] churches in the name of Luther's
[19:26] message they did shameful disgraceful
[19:31] things that Luther's message did not
[19:34] teach
[19:35] them but
[19:38] fanaticism leads
[19:40] people to go into an
[19:43] extreme things I was just telling uh our
[19:47] brother last
[19:51] yesterday
[19:52] people they they don't
[19:57] balance
[19:59] the way the prophet carried himself
[20:01] conducted
[20:04] himself here the prophet on
[20:08] the blasting organizational
[20:14] system preaching in a very very strong
[20:18] and direct
[20:21] way and
[20:26] condemning Hallelujah last in
[20:30] women all of these things that he
[20:33] preached he had to preach it
[20:36] that he had to bring the message
[20:41] that well don't you for one
[20:44] second think that he was that
[20:47] way when he would talk to
[20:50] somebody in a personal
[20:56] convers people hear the
[20:59] tape and then when they're in a in a
[21:02] personal conversation with
[21:06] somebody they think they're on they're
[21:08] on the
[21:10] pulit
[21:12] preaching and they can show you look
[21:15] said it right
[21:17] here see what I'm
[21:19] saying but I want to know that the
[21:23] spirit that was in
[21:25] Christ amen the spirit that was in the
[21:29] how did he talk to
[21:31] people how did he talk to a
[21:33] woman that was painted up that was under
[21:37] the
[21:38] deceit of some
[21:41] denomination amen amen was there
[21:44] love to try to show
[21:48] her love that she's in the
[21:51] wrong try to bring her to the
[21:54] truth and show some
[21:57] light that she hasn't seen something
[22:00] that they haven't taught
[22:03] her but we
[22:06] forget that we were once in that
[22:08] condition am we forget that we were
[22:12] Catholics worshiping some stupid
[22:18] ID we
[22:20] forget that we were
[22:22] once
[22:26] ignorant
[22:30] am just because you know
[22:32] things by the
[22:34] message doesn't give you the
[22:37] right to put somebody
[22:41] down amen that's a condition
[22:44] like that's not the spirit of
[22:47] Christ you're pushing people
[22:49] away you're not bringing them
[22:53] Inu the attitude of a lot of people in
[22:55] the
[22:56] message
[22:58] amen that's not what I see in the
[23:01] prophet that's not what I see in
[23:04] Christ you understand what I'm saying
[23:09] amen
[23:14] hallelujah
[23:18] be what you
[23:21] believe got be the
[23:26] spirit
[23:28] now
[23:31] watch brother
[23:38] brandham has showed
[23:40] us
[23:42] exactly
[23:44] that again in this
[23:46] hour this ministry of Malachi
[23:49] 4 is to
[23:54] restore the hearts of the
[23:56] children back to this
[24:03] faith and bring
[24:05] us back into the
[24:08] place in the same
[24:11] position that same
[24:15] tree he
[24:18] planted that tree that was cut
[24:21] down by the Roman system just like
[24:25] Christ the Tree of Life
[24:28] was cut down by the Roman
[24:31] system
[24:33] amen the bride
[24:40] tree would be restored
[24:44] Again by
[24:47] Malachi brother Bram gives us
[24:50] this this
[24:53] truth this
[24:55] Revelation he shows us this
[24:59] the message the restoration of the
[25:02] [Music]
[25:03] Bride but one thing I want to point out
[25:05] to begin
[25:07] with as we are in this book of Acts
[25:16] series and today we're going to be
[25:18] speaking on the True
[25:23] Vine and the fruitful branches
[25:30] amen amen the True
[25:33] Vine and the fruitful
[25:37] branches
[25:39] so one thing we want to point out to
[25:42] begin
[25:43] with is that brother bam shows
[25:47] us that the
[25:52] tree that Christ
[25:55] planted he planted it
[25:59] in the book of
[26:02] Acts that's where that tree
[26:08] began
[26:09] understand but the restoration of that
[26:16] tree is not
[26:20] restored until Malachi
[26:24] 4 restores it back by word amen
[26:29] amen hallelujah because although
[26:33] Luther brought a truth to it he wasn't
[26:37] restoring the
[26:39] truth he was bringing a
[26:42] truth that this
[26:45] messenger was going to
[26:47] take as he was going to tie the loose
[26:51] end to bring this church
[26:55] again you see what I'm saying
[26:58] in other words the tree is not
[27:03] restored in Luther's age or
[27:07] Wesley's
[27:09] P brother Bram said the restoration of
[27:14] this
[27:16] tree amen had to
[27:19] be
[27:21] after the
[27:24] ministry
[27:25] Elijah and the son of man
[27:28] amen amen
[27:30] hallelujah
[27:32] amen but just like
[27:35] Jesus when he
[27:38] died that tree was cut
[27:41] down he said it took three
[27:45] days for the tree to rise
[27:50] up brother
[27:53] that to Luther's
[27:56] age
[27:58] see in that first day when he had first
[28:03] died that's Luther's
[28:05] age he's still in the grave the tree
[28:08] hasn't rose up
[28:11] yet see what I'm saying amen second day
[28:15] he's still in the
[28:17] grave Wesley's age he hasn't rose up
[28:21] yet amen third
[28:25] day he rose but brother bam said it was
[28:29] only a
[28:31] rumor
[28:33] why because that was a
[28:36] beginning the Pentecostal age there was
[28:39] a rumor that went
[28:41] around that the same
[28:43] Jesus that Liv 2 years ago alive
[28:48] again but he said that was the third day
[28:51] in the
[28:53] morning because Mary ran to tell the
[28:59] amen there was others like Luke 24 on
[29:02] the road to
[29:05] Damascus right Jesus appeared to them
[29:10] and then he made himself known to them
[29:12] and they ran back to
[29:15] Jerusalem to tell the disciples what
[29:18] they had seen see it was all
[29:24] rumors until Jesus according to
[29:28] John chapter
[29:31] 19 it's the Bible it's the
[29:35] prophet and St John chapter
[29:39] 20 he appeared
[29:41] to to
[29:47] them in the evening time that third
[29:52] day he made himself known and the Bible
[29:56] says he
[29:58] began to open up the
[30:01] word
[30:06] amen that's a
[30:08] type of this evening
[30:11] time when this even light was going to
[30:15] come to make himself
[30:17] known the ministry of Elijah the
[30:21] prophet and the son of man healing
[30:26] himself
[30:28] to open to us the
[30:30] word and show us and even the disciples
[30:34] that had walked with
[30:35] him and that had believed in him and
[30:39] that had been
[30:40] Justified Sanctified said Now
[30:45] understand
[30:47] amen Jesus didn't just rest when he I'm
[30:51] talking about his
[30:53] resurrection is his resurrected
[30:56] for
[30:57] he
[31:08] Tau yes and the Bible says and by many
[31:21] infall who he
[31:24] was then he gave him the promise
[31:29] then he breathe the Breath of Life
[31:32] on
[31:33] Amen as the
[31:40] father to
[31:41] [Music]
[31:42] the wait for the
[31:46] promise shall
[31:53] receive amen that shows you
[31:56] exactly
[31:57] that if this
[32:00] ministry has come to our hour to our
[32:04] age our day to our
[32:09] generation amen want to come out of this
[32:13] Resurrection
[32:16] Ministry amen
[32:19] amen is
[32:22] exact
[32:26] Hallelujah
[32:28] in other words what's to come out of
[32:31] this
[32:33] ministry that we have received this
[32:35] message of this
[32:38] Prophet was to come out of
[32:45] it brother tells us and the message it
[32:49] is the rising of the
[32:51] Sun that that first chief that reached
[32:53] maturity back there 2000 years years ago
[32:58] was the first one to
[32:59] rise amen and he was waved over the
[33:03] people and he said that
[33:08] waving of that
[33:10] sheath over the people was on the day of
[33:16] Pentecost Hallelujah and that's why that
[33:20] waving caused the mighty rushing
[33:24] wind to come into the upper room
[33:28] and fill them the pillar of fire all
[33:32] that was in
[33:33] Christ divided
[33:35] itself and set upon Hallelujah right
[33:42] amen he poured into the
[33:45] church but brother Bram says it's not
[33:48] poor like we
[33:51] poor he see because our thinking of
[33:55] pouring is that you pour and then this
[33:58] is
[33:59] empty after you pour the water from
[34:04] this this stays empty he says God can't
[34:07] do that amen he said the word is
[34:12] kenosis
[34:14] amen which means that he
[34:17] pours that doesn't mean that he's empty
[34:19] if he pours everything in
[34:25] US
[34:27] amen hallelujah see what I'm
[34:31] saying hallelujah hallelujah he
[34:37] divides a
[34:43] reprod so this is where we're
[34:47] at brother bam says the restoration of
[34:49] the brid
[34:51] tree now talking of
[34:54] restoring here in Joel
[34:58] God is speaking here in
[35:00] Jo listen to this God is
[35:05] speaking of his fruit
[35:08] tree that he had
[35:17] planted
[35:20] he on the
[35:22] day
[35:25] amen and he brought that tree
[35:28] there for a
[35:31] purpose
[35:34] amen right what's the
[35:37] purpose he wanted it to bear his
[35:43] fruit amen and what is that God's
[35:49] word
[35:51] amen the tree bearing
[35:55] fruit is God's
[35:57] amen he wanted a
[35:59] church that would keep his
[36:04] word all down through the age Eve had
[36:08] failed to
[36:11] keep the Jews failed to keep the law
[36:17] failed all had
[36:20] failed do you hear what the prophet is
[36:23] saying that the reason he planted this
[36:26] tree
[36:28] on the day of
[36:29] Pentecost is because he wanted it to
[36:32] bear
[36:33] fruit am fruit of the
[36:36] word that would not
[36:42] fail don't you know there's a
[36:45] promise don't you know there's a
[36:48] prophecy in the God of this evil a
[36:52] message and Christ is the mystery of God
[36:55] revealed message
[36:57] this bride will not
[37:02] fail why did the other churches
[37:06] fail because it was exactly
[37:10] that just a
[37:13] church
[37:15] Hallelujah you hear what I said
[37:18] amen then you might say then what are we
[37:20] supposed to
[37:22] be the
[37:24] word amen amen can the word
[37:30] fail can Christ
[37:32] fail that's why this is a time of
[37:37] Union it's a time to be one with
[37:40] him and that cannot fail because it's
[37:44] the word it's not
[37:47] man it's not man governing a
[37:50] church it's not man organized in a
[37:54] church his spirit

[38:03] overseeing
[38:05] amen he has the
[38:09] oversight he has the
[38:13] controlj Adam said the church is
[38:15] controlled by the Holy
[38:19] Spirit it should be
[38:24] anyway and the Holy Spirit directs us to
[38:27] the
[38:28] word to act out the word carry on the
[38:33] word and bring
[38:36] fruit

[40:37] everybody claims to be the Church of
[40:39] Christ the Church of God the Pentecostal
[40:43] Church the Apostolic Church they're all
[40:47] claiming what we're talking
[40:50] about they all claim to be
[40:54] that Amen brother
[41:01] say
[41:07] hallelujah and brother Ram
[41:11] said that
[41:13] same that same
[41:18] devu just
[41:22] Chang four
[41:25] stages
[41:26] amen
[41:28] amen see what people don't
[41:31] understand is that brother vam is
[41:34] preaching a
[41:37] message not just
[41:39] sermons he is preaching a
[41:46] message so when he speaks in restoration
[41:48] of the brid
[41:50] tree he speaks it in the seven
[41:55] Church
[41:58] you understand what I'm saying he showed
[42:00] you in the seven Church
[42:02] ages how the spirit of antichrist came
[42:06] in defiled the
[42:08] church and ran it all the way until com
[42:11] to this
[42:13] last and how in the lean Church
[42:17] age that he preached in
[42:20] 1960 he showed you there like he said
[42:24] Friday God is going to turn
[42:31] back go back to
[42:35] thew it's a message it's
[42:39] everywhere not just exclusive in one
[42:42] part brother is preaching a
[42:46] message amen then when he comes to the
[42:49] opening of The Seven
[42:52] Seals what does he
[42:55] show that the same Spirit of
[43:00] antichrist it's not a different
[43:07] writer it's the same Spirit of
[43:11] an just changing
[43:17] form from the White Horse to the red
[43:21] horse to the black horse to
[43:25] the
[43:29] you see what I'm saying
[43:34] am but to
[43:37] me that makes it more even more
[43:41] clear that the
[43:44] restoration can't
[43:46] be during the
[43:48] time are you hearing
[43:51] me during the
[43:53] time that these four
[43:59] stages havee up the
[44:04] tree I don't know if you got what I'm
[44:09] saying it's the White Horse and the red
[44:12] horse and the

[44:32] covers and what it it what is what did
[44:35] it
[44:38] affect who did it
[44:41] kill right who did
[44:44] destroy when you see that then you see
[44:47] the picture
[44:48] clear then you see that the
[44:51] restoration has to come after
[44:54] that amen
[44:57] amen
[44:59] amen although in every
[45:02] age was there was
[45:07] Bri in every age there was an elected
[45:11] group sealed with the light that God had
[45:16] given them for that time but let me

[45:21] something that is still
[45:24] not although they're bride

[1:27:37] everye
[1:27:43] am I'm telling
[1:27:45] you
[1:27:51] iten
[1:27:53] that's why in the vision of the
[1:27:56] Prophet the first thing he
[1:27:59] saw was that first
[1:28:03] oral is that
[1:28:07] right he says and then after
[1:28:11] herble
[1:28:15] churches vision
[1:28:19] is because the first thing wasn't a
[1:28:21] horrible
[1:28:23] church first thing was an
[1:28:29] original
[1:28:41] after until finally
[1:28:48] saw
[1:28:51] Church
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:57] amen in
[1:29:01] emotions being
[1:29:16] WIC see because after the book of

[1:29:39] horrible
[1:29:41] am am but after he

[1:31:04] fashioned Holy Ghost you call what does
[1:31:06] it
[1:31:10] produce what does it
[1:31:12] produce what does it
[1:31:15] give because brother Ram said the Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost will never deny
[1:31:22] any
[1:31:24] words and the Bible is
[1:31:28] wrote by that Holy
[1:31:31] Ghost amen the word is made
[1:31:35] Spirit dwelling in
[1:31:38] us I will be with
[1:31:40] you you to
[1:31:45] the brother Adam says anybody says that
[1:31:49] they got the Holy Ghost and denies one
[1:31:53] word this then it's not the Holy
[1:31:57] Ghost the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible
[1:32:00] amen every
[1:32:02] word man shall not live by bread alone
[1:32:05] but by every word the ho ghost
[1:32:08] recognizes the word
[1:32:10] only because that's his word and he
[1:32:13] cannot go back on his word he has to
[1:32:16] keep his word hallelujah amen amen and
[1:32:19] then the message the the word is falling
[1:32:24] apart he says you want to
[1:32:26] know the secret where where the secret
[1:32:30] lies the power of
[1:32:32] visions and things is back to the
[1:32:40] word
[1:32:44] says He says people
[1:32:47] today they claim that they have great
[1:32:50] revivals oh brother we had a tremendous
[1:32:54] Revival oh yes there was a lot of this
[1:32:57] and a lot of
[1:32:58] that he says but what comes out of
[1:33:04] it who in that
[1:33:07] Revival was brought back to the
[1:33:12] word he said in the Ephesian
[1:33:15] church every true
[1:33:18] reviv is when people
[1:33:22] came back to the
[1:33:24] word to rev when people are beginning to
[1:33:28] line themselves
[1:33:29] up with that word that is a Revival
[1:33:34] taking place inside of
[1:33:38] individual am that's that tree being
[1:33:42] restored again hallelujah
[1:33:45] hallelujah brother
[1:33:48] remember some of you here may also
[1:33:52] our
[1:33:53] sister Rebecca testified of
[1:33:57] it in our last
[1:33:59] Service uh in the
[1:34:04] building amen testimony
[1:34:07] service first time I
[1:34:09] preached on the restoration of the Bri
[1:34:12] tree
[1:34:14] amen the pillar of fire showed up in the
[1:34:19] service confirming
[1:34:22] we are in that
[1:34:29] time fire didn't go
[1:34:35] away angel of God didn't
[1:34:39] leave the angel of
[1:34:41] God
[1:34:43] Christ amen amen with the rainbow over
[1:34:46] his
[1:34:47] head is still here hallelujah that's why
[1:34:50] we can go to
[1:35:08] we can still hear his
[1:35:10] voice that's the book of Acts he can
[1:35:13] still lead us and direct us and guide
[1:35:16] us amen he can still fill with the Holy
[1:35:20] Ghost
[1:35:24] got
[1:35:25] will you got to
[1:35:28] have we got to give our
[1:35:32] all

[1:35:50] mejah
[1:35:52] remember said I am the True

[1:36:34] hour we must abide in
[1:36:38] him we must
[1:36:41] abide
[1:36:48] word that's the trouble of today
[1:36:53] the people are not getting into the
[1:36:58] word the people are
[1:37:00] not getting into the
[1:37:04] message it's just
[1:37:10] superficial just little basic
[1:37:16] principles amen amen that's all
[1:37:20] right
[1:37:22] but that will
[1:37:25] never give you the
[1:37:29] power of the Mage amen message
[1:37:36] Anin message
[1:37:40] hasu you got to abide in that
[1:37:45] M because you say well Christ said abide
[1:37:48] in me what do you think this message
[1:37:55] what do you think this message
[1:37:56] is something other than
[1:37:59] Christ
[1:38:01] amen something other than the
[1:38:04] word brother this
[1:38:07] message
[1:38:10] Christ
[1:38:15] the so we got to abide in
[1:38:20] that are you hearing me
[1:38:23] church amen we got to abide in that
[1:38:29] word because there's a power
[1:38:33] amen and he said you shall
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:39] receive they had already
[1:38:47] received they already been
[1:38:50] established in the four
[1:38:53] gospels who taught
[1:38:57] them now
[1:38:59] he after you have heard all of these
[1:39:02] things I have taught you it's time to
[1:39:09] receive this same word that I have
[1:39:12] taught
[1:39:16] you you see what I'm saying am brother
[1:39:20] bam said
[1:39:21] there's
[1:39:23] mechanic then there's dyamics to that
[1:39:28] mechanic
[1:39:30] amen and he got the word
[1:39:35] dynamics from the Bible he wasn't making
[1:39:38] it
[1:39:40] up that's why the Bible said in the last
[1:39:43] days there'll be those who have a form
[1:39:47] of
[1:39:49] godliness but they will deny
[1:39:52] the
[1:39:55] power amen power in that
[1:40:01] scripture and in many other
[1:40:04] scriptures is the Greek
[1:40:06] [Applause]

[1:40:11] dunam which where we get our English
[1:40:19] word
[1:40:22] amen hallelujah see amen
[1:40:27] Dynamics is power you shall receive
[1:40:33] power then you be my
[1:40:36] Witnesses but we can never be a true
[1:40:40] witness of this message until you
[1:40:43] receive
[1:40:49] power he says in believe from the
[1:40:52] heart God showing his
[1:40:55] power not me I'm just a
[1:41:01] branch amen he energized the
[1:41:06] branch till I couldn't help from
[1:41:09] uttering them
[1:41:15] voices what would I ever have thought of
[1:41:18] a little fish laying there
[1:41:23] when we had even cut him
[1:41:27] up baited on the line the little fish
[1:41:29] hanging there laying
[1:41:35] dead and Mr wood and them sitting right
[1:41:38] looking at me now witness of

[2:09:07] planted by rivers of
[2:09:10] water hallu Hallelujah you say well he
[2:09:14] didn't say Rivers
[2:09:17] here

[2:09:24] amen
[2:09:26] am brother Adam says this in thean
[2:09:30] church
[2:09:33] AG he says to
[2:09:39] understand of a born
[2:09:42] again and spirit
[2:09:46] fi many have
[2:09:50] misinterpreted being spirit filled and
[2:09:52] being born again as two different
[2:09:56] things in St John
[2:09:59] 7 verses 37 to
[2:10:02] 39 read now with understanding the
[2:10:06] prophet
[2:10:07] says on the great day of the feast Jesus
[2:10:11] stood and cried saying if any
[2:10:15] thirst let him come unto me drink he
[2:10:19] that believeth on me as the scripture
[2:10:22] have said out of his belly shall
[2:10:27] flow
[2:10:29] rivers of Living
[2:10:33] Water and this he spake of the
[2:10:39] spirit which they that believed on
[2:10:43] him should receive the Holy
[2:10:47] Ghost for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[2:10:52] given because that Jesus had not yet
[2:10:56] been glorified
[2:10:58] amen that's what the scripture says
[2:11:00] right there
[2:11:02] John so in other words when he said he
[2:11:05] that is a thirst come and I'll give him
[2:11:06] the
[2:11:09] drink and inside of
[2:11:15] him
[2:11:17] living he was
[2:11:19] speaking according to the Bible
[2:11:23] interpretation and the prophet of God in
[2:11:26] the SM and church
[2:11:28] age John chapter
[2:11:31] 7 amen he was
[2:11:35] speaking verses
[2:11:38] 38 and
[2:11:40] 39 but this he spake he of the spirit
[2:11:44] which they that believed on him should
[2:11:45] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[2:11:47] given because that Jesus was not yet
[2:11:59] glorified you see the Bible interpret
[2:12:04] itself in other words when Jesus said
[2:12:06] rivers of
[2:12:08] water he was speaking when they would
[2:12:11] receive the Holy
[2:12:13] Ghost the day of
[2:12:15] Pentecost you get that now so when David
[2:12:20] said I saw a
[2:12:22] tree
[2:12:24] planted by rivers of
[2:12:26] water brother says he was
[2:12:30] see R
[2:12:32] Tree God
[2:12:34] plant Hallelujah on the day of
[2:12:39] Pentecost why because there's the rivers
[2:12:42] of water and there's the tree the vine
[2:12:46] in the tree with the branches giving
[2:12:50] fruit hallelujah
[2:12:53] hallelujah but you say but Joseph is a
[2:13:04] fruitful and his
[2:13:07] branches amen run over the wall
[2:13:15] what look what the prophet says
[2:13:22] now keeping through keeping this thought
[2:13:24] in
[2:13:26] mind we read John
[2:13:32] 14
[2:13:34] 14 if thou would know the gift of God
[2:13:36] and who sayith to thee give me the drink
[2:13:38] thou wouldest have asked of him that he
[2:13:41] would have given thee Living
[2:13:46] Water
[2:13:50] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[2:13:52] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[2:13:54] the water that I shall give him shall be
[2:13:57] in
[2:13:58] him in him amen a wh of water springing
[2:14:02] up into everlasting
[2:14:16] life
[2:14:19] amen mother Madam said this same living
[2:14:23] water is mentioned but this time is not
[2:14:28] called a river or Rivers it is called in
[2:14:33] Aran
[2:14:36] well there is where people make their
[2:14:40] mistake because it is called a
[2:14:42] well and a river and they think that in
[2:14:47] one place they're given eternal life by
[2:14:50] the spirit and the next
[2:14:53] place is called the
[2:14:55] river
[2:14:57] implying a great D
[2:15:03] dynamism it has to be the
[2:15:06] spirit now given as an end of
[2:15:11] power but it's not
[2:15:13] so in other words two different things
[2:15:17] it is one one and the same
[2:15:20] thing it is the spirit that gives life
[2:15:24] and power and that
[2:15:36] came
[2:15:38] expence so what
[2:15:46] did
[2:15:49] Riv
[2:15:52] am what did Jacob see in hision when
[2:16:00] blessing amen
[2:16:03] amen a
[2:16:05] branch a Vine with
[2:16:09] branches fruit
[2:16:14] Branch those
[2:16:16] branches
[2:16:23] but where did he
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:34] see the
[2:16:37] sameus it's the same the prophet saw
[2:16:42] amen is the vine the True Vine and the
[2:16:47] fruitful
[2:16:50] Hallelujah is that right if the first
[2:16:53] church was a product of that vine Jesus
[2:16:58] Christ wrote a book of
[2:17:00] Acts then the second
[2:17:03] Branch will have to be same
[2:17:07] thing brother the only time he's ever
[2:17:12] produced another
[2:17:15] Branch since that time
[2:17:20] amen hallelujah hallelujah I am the vine
[2:17:25] you are the
[2:17:27] branches if if the first
[2:17:30] Branch brought forth Joy love
[2:17:35] loyalty gifts of the Spirit casting out
[2:17:38] evil
[2:17:39] spirit Water baptis by
[2:17:43] Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[2:17:46] Christ hallelujah hallelujah then the
[2:17:50] second
[2:17:51] Branch will have to do the
[2:17:54] same but all these
[2:17:56] others Pentecostals Baptist Methodist
[2:18:00] they cannot write a book of act behind
[2:18:04] their
[2:18:05] Church why because it's in the wrong
[2:18:09] L there's something wrong with it if
[2:18:13] Jesus was on the Earth
[2:18:15] today and I would walk up him and say
[2:18:19] Lord Jesus I go to a church that don't
[2:18:23] believe in Divine Healing he would say
[2:18:28] it wasn't so from the
[2:18:30] beginning if I went to Jesus and said
[2:18:33] Lord my church does not believe in
[2:18:35] speaking with other
[2:18:37] tongues he would say it wasn't so from
[2:18:40] the
[2:18:41] beginning if I went to the Lord Jesus
[2:18:44] and I have been sprinkled and my church
[2:18:48] says it's all right my pastor says if I
[2:18:51] sprinkle you with
[2:18:52] water it's just as good as immersing
[2:18:55] with
[2:18:56] water Jesus would
[2:18:58] answer wasn't
[2:19:01] so
[2:19:03] hallelujah oh brother he's the same
[2:19:07] yesterday
[2:19:10] forever this
[2:19:12] power Hallelujah and this is a full
[2:19:16] restoration
[2:19:18] am that original bride
[2:19:21] tree amen and these
[2:19:24] branches God this R amen is not going to
[2:19:30] be pruned
[2:19:31] off this ride is not going to be cut off
[2:19:37] Hallelujah brother
[2:19:40] this Branch will run over the
[2:19:46] wall because we're by the
[2:19:50] well is that right who is Joseph the
[2:19:54] spirit filled
[2:19:55] Church hallelujah hallelujah that book
[2:19:58] of Acts
