day of Jesus Christ and this is [Applause] foreign thanks glorious my spirit s [Music] and Peter picks it up that prophecya it says in his Doctrine foreign [Music] nominations [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] do not play Man [Music] it's fulfilled foreign [Music] United foreign make a million more than before make Presbyterians make Pentecostals but where is a manifestation yes Los Angeles what the promises of the message itself that the spoken word that is if you practice lemons [Music] you get oranges where's the practice amen Hallelujah historical word why is it so hard it's because they're not planning to be corrected yeah amen [Music] you can claim to have Revival and have a lot of rain dependable have a lot of spirit and it was a spirit but if there's no teaching because according to the message of the owls according to the Bible that's not a true move of God Amen there must be the correct seat plan today the fruit of the season that's why Jesus said yeah there it is

misunderstand me I love you honey I'm trying to get you I'm trying to get this to you I'll stop when I'm finished today I'll let it go but I want to let you know one time what's wrong and the reason I believe what I believe I believe the devil's deceived you frankly I know according to God's words that's why preach those things the way I do because God's word said it okay this is a different day for anything it's the same word but notice is just the same as he was when when he spoke the only thing is why don't we get the crops it's because we've got the wrong kind of a seeds how many would like to change a letter or some change please and they go from Methodist Pentecost this is to make them twice see notice twice up by the roots Give Me Jesus says every planet that my heavenly father and father says or whatever idea it is every man's word is alive but mine is the truth so come back to your sins the same words if I'm black cucumbers what am I going to get cucumbers see right now if you want a church must have the word of God except the words and if that is the fullness of God it will rain yes listen to the denominations just like in the days Billy Graham Billy Graham Revival in our team God's sinner Revival a sinner Revival to America America all of those things are moving amen what denominations are crying foreign that's what's happening right now amen but the thing is it is gonna fall and it is going to produce what they have planned will because it changes what's most important okay is what's being planted because the Rain's Gonna Fall amen and that's why whatever is

Lord and and it shall be to the Lord for a name amen Everlasting sign they shall not be cut off it was they knew it was and it was necessary of a return of a dynamic power that was before in the church these Believers and their spirits and they began their cries that was in the first century when they see you what seemed to be the answer came as they began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit that that was indeed the long-awaited Restorations could this be the real thing if teaching rain had not comes the prophet Messengers foreign I mean yeah each came from from a from

one you know if we the one that appeared down at the river I was only standing there when he appeared that performs these things and Fork tells things to happen as they are I'm only the one that I was only holies I just surrendered myself and he spoke through me it is oh no oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man how do you know what manifestation means it wasn't his message it was the mystery that God unfolded foreign yes [Music] these are his last names before he prays and he says that he said it wasn't the angel it's the mystery of that God unfolded it's not a man that's open it's God the angel was not the son of man but today Roy teaching they teach it yeah he says right here himself and I came in with these bats where they have trouble problems because it's so close yeah
