the hearer and the reader of Thy word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen Hallelujah blessed be his name hallelujah thank you Jesus amen God bless you Amen Let Us stand on our feet open the Bible God bless you tonight each one in the presence of the Lord amen we deem this a great privilege because we know that these privileges one day will soon be taken but until until then we're striving and we're under preparation we're under expectation and prayer amen for that final Deliverance because in that time we have a promise amen as we seen this morning that which we have seen temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power amen it may lay dormant for a while but brother that seed is receiving the Rays of light is being gered amen that one day it'll burst forth the fullness of that life Amen brother said there will be a mighty marching Army amen an invisble army hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we believe that with all our heart amen so we go to the book of St John we want to read from verse three chapter three I'm sorry and we read here from verse 19 19 we read this uh at the end there this morning we want to pick it up there St John 3 ver 19 and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil how many understand a little more what that light is amen hallelujah it's the word of the hour when that word is revealed that's light shining making the Bible a new book the message of the hour shines upon the word and we see the Mysteries revealed amen amen that's light Hallelujah in the evening time there shall be light and and we can testify is not that there shall be light there is light amen shall be was a prophecy but there is is the Fulfillment amen amen glory to God and then we see how that light progresses from the revelation of what we're beholding to that light coming in US amen and we becoming one with that word that word becomes flesh that's the light of the age was it made flesh in the prophet amen amen and each one in their position each one in their portion each one as Paul said in the Book of Romans according to your Measure of Faith everyone has been given a Measure of Faith amen amen amen according to your measure amen according to your calling your position in the body of Christ it says here verse 20 for everyone that doth evil ha is the the light neither cometh to the light these his de should be reproved but he that does truth cometh to light that his these may be man made manifest they are R in God Amen let's turn to St John chapter 5 we read from verses 33 533 ye sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I received not testimony from men but these things I say that ye might be saved for remember we read this morning St John 1 remember that verse six what did it say there was a man sent from God right amen amen named John and he said he was not the light but he was sent to Bear witness of the life that everyone through his ministry might believe on him is that right brother that same Ministry has come in this hour but the difference in this ministry of the prophet of God is that he was the Forerunner giving witness that that light was to come when that light shined on the River Ohio the voice said as John the Baptist was forun s to forun my first coming you will forun your message will forun my second coming is that right and brother bam was always announcing there's one coming there's one coming amen and that's where all these eighth Messengers rise because they failed to realize amen that that Ministry come to a change from John the Baptist into the ministry of the son of man in the same man in the same Prophet amen see and when his ministry changed from Forerunner to the revealing of the son of man that was the Lord himself that descended from heaven with a shout that was the opening of the word that was the third pool him coming into the prophetic office amen there's no higher order to reveal the word than a prophet is that what he said anointed ones at the end time 1965 first Divine Healing second pool Discerning of the spirits third pool the opening of the word he said there's no higher office than a prophet that's why before that said I'm not in the office of a prophet amen but in order to open the word he had to come into that office amen and that was the third pool and when we see that Revelation brother that was the revealing of God himself revealing his own word Christ is the mystery of God revealed is that right Christ is revealed in his own word amen amen then we see that that's that light of the age amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah notice here as we continue to read verse 34 uh verse 35 he was a burning speaking of John a burning and a Shining Light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but I have greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father have given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father have sent me amen you may be seated God bless you we can continue to read uh you can continue to read it if you want to continue to study that little part there but chapter 5 is a tremendous chapter and we have uh spoke out of this before brother Bram mentions the message I have heard but now I see he speaks very clearly very reveal of verses 24 and 25 because uh speaks of the Son of God the voice of the Son of God the voice of the son of man and then he goes on to show us how that this uh one that had been sent from God he was he was announcing that there was one to come but when he came he said he is here there's one Among Us amen amen but when he saw him then he said behold the lamb is that right Amen brother Bram if you follow him see that that's I've been saying this a lot lately because it's important for us to understand that we don't just uh uh uh stay with one statement of the Prophet but in that certain statement speaking of a certain subject or a certain point or a certain scripture we we follow the prophet amen amen and we begin to find a pattern and that's the problem that many don't follow the prophet through the message because he always be adds more to that particular subject or to that particular scripture he he begins to add more to that and when you take what he said all through the message you find how the Revelation was opening more and more until he come to a perfect understanding of that scripture but it was only by experience not only by knowledge it was by experience and it for instance if we take the scriptures of St John 14:12 amen which is the scripture where Jesus said we we quoted it this morning where where Jesus said the works that I do he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen and I didn't I don't want to take a lot of time this morning to explain on that that's why I said if you know the message you know what I'm saying because in the earlier years when brother bam would quote that scripture he said the correct translation is not greater it's more how many heard brother Braham say that amen amen he said because no one can do greater than Christ he said but it's more of the same works because it's in his body around the world amen amen and it wasn't until 1959 that brother bam had an experience in had Wright's mother's house wasn't har Wright's house it was her mother's house where he had the experience of the third pool operating for the first time for the first time on a human being because it was done amen for for animal life and for different things in' 64 I believe it was that it was used on the storm and things like that later on it was used for the tumor but up until 59 he had not used it on human being and for the first time we know the story that God himself came down a super anointing and told the prophet tell her to ask what she wants is that right and it would be given to her right there brother bam said God already knew amen what she was going to ask and God put that in her heart amen although she could have asked for a million dollars brother ROM said sir that's not fake she could have asked for that and they would have been right there brother B said she could have asked for the for for the restoring of the Youth of her parents he said that in the Holy Ghost series what was the Holy Ghost given for he said he said she could have asked for the restoration of the Youth of her parents body bodies of her sister that was lame amen said but all those things would have aged again would have got sick again the money would have disappeared amen but she said the right thing the salvation of her two boys is that right God knew that so by that experience brother Bram in 196 preached that day at Calvary is that right amen and in the message that day at Calvary he quotes St John 14:12 and for the first time he brings out more Revelation upon that same scripture and what does he say Jesus said Greater Works he says what are the the Greater Works he said to impart eternal life he said because when Jesus was here alive in the flesh he never saved no one because there was no salvation until after his death burial and Resurrection his blood had to be shed his life had to be given and he had to ascend to intercede for us then there salvation but while he was here in life there was no salvation so he said Greater Works is what the apostles did Amen in the book of Acts when 3,000 Souls came to Christ Chu he said and then 5,000 more he said the apostles imparted eternal life Hallelujah and brother Bram said that's the Greater Works why would he say that because by experience in 1959 under the the power of the third pool he imp Ed eternal life you understand what I'm saying he said I give you your two boys in the name of Jesus Christ brother bam said their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and right there their names were called amen amen glory to God GL because of experience he's seen that scripture different and that's why many times the spirit comes across the pulpit amen exhorting and and rebuking because brother this is not only something that we could hear the word say oh yes I like that and this is good and that's all right I already heard that but but this one's better yes I like that one but it's more than that hallelujah what we hear the Revelation that's been preached this message that we hear on tape this message that we read in books is more than that amen amen we should know it by experience and then it will mean more to us because God interprets his word by bringing it to pass that's the interpretation of it amen amen that's how you know that's the true interpretation so then after that amen amen it was until 64 that brother ban him for the first time I read the quote this morning from the message shalom shalom did I read the quote this morning where where he quoted Greater Works St John 1412 and he never corrected the greater he never said it was more it wasn't greater it was more no he left it as greater and then because of experience and because of Revelation amen he said the greater is this that creation was spoken it wasn't multiplication like Jesus that had water and made it into wine had some fish and some bread amen amen that was that was in a boy's lunch right amen amen and with that he multiplied and fed 5,000 and still they picked up 12 baskets full is that right when they seen that brother they begin to follow his ministry we want free fish and bread amen amen but then he turned around and told him you follow me because of the fish and brave and they said well show us a sign you say you're greater than Moses and Moses in the wilderness gave our father's bread Mana from Heaven came down you show us something greater than that he said I am the bread of life Hallelujah and I have come down from heaven if you eat of me you shall never die hallelujah hallelujah said your fathers ate and every one of them are dead he turally separated amen amen you see people they they think that greater Miracle greater sign is literal but really brother the greatest things in God is the spiritual and the supernatural when you see then that that scripture to brother Brandon became more clear and what it really was it was a revelation because that scripture being revealed light shining upon it then it becoming flesh in his own testimony and his own experience hallelujah hallelujah and then it becomes life you understand and that's how not only that scripture but all scriptures amen the prophet of God seen how how it become more clear every time you understand say Amen so we find here this scripture that we read in St John 5 I was on my way this morning to read some of these quotes the devil's uh messing with my tablets or since I got Microsoft Word on my phone I just pull it up here and here I have the same quotes Hallelujah stored amen am watch what the prophet says in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light first he he showed us like we seen this morning that that seed laying dormant when the light shines upon it it comes to life and then and then he told us in the in the Shalom message shom that that third pool was going to lay dormant but in the time of the persecution in the time of the squeeze amen he said don't worry little sister there's a man in here can turn on the light during that time you understand see that's that to me that's clear to to me that that that makes it clear amen that what he is saying is that that third pool amen won't be used you could want iten you can cry for it you can jump up and down and Shake all around and run and do everything you want but it's got to be in the season it's got to be at the time amen amen and until then amen that light can't illuminate the thing fully but in the time then it opens up that part and then that is available for the believer because brother said when that church comes to adoption he said she will speak and it will create itself he said but it won't last long it'll be very short and the mouths of the critics will be shut amen hallelujah hear ye him that's a prophecy saying that the bride coming to adoption will speak and it'll create but brother it's got to be in the season see Hallelujah I remember back when we begin to preach those things here in the church when those things be first begin to open up amen there was Brothers you know wanting to do it and let's do it then what are we waiting for we we can't wait no more amen I heard it right here from someone in the church see he's not here today so don't look nowhere uh but he said well we can't wait we can't wait we got it now but brother you have to know when it's available it's not for public show it's for when you really need it and when you really need it it's there it's available Hallelujah don't worry little sister there's a man that can turn on the light Hallelujah let there be light and there's light that's the interpretation amen amen so brother B said those things are controlled by a law is that right it's got to be controlled by a law and that's a law of faith and what is Faith Revelation where does revelation come from from the word so it's got to be according to the word it's got to be according to the season got to be according to the time you can't get ahead of God you got to let him lead but are those things available now yes are they in our in our possession do we have authority to use them yes brother B said in the Paradox message if you're in the line of duty like Joshua you can speak amen why cry speak like Peter he didn't have to cry spoke and the man was healed those things are here but the fullness of its power will come in its season and brother that's right around the corner this is time of preparation now watch he says here in the message Revelation book of symbol he says so the Church of the Living God that's been born down in the mud of fanaticism and Chaos she's wound her way through the grime until she's on the top just waiting for her wings for the flight he shall run to and fr and the people that know their God shall do exploits God's revelation to his church set still Little Flock positionally stay where you are like sister Gertie and sister angre used to sing Keep Holding On don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's holding back the coming of Christ and the great Millennium is the great Supernatural power that lays dormant in the church Hallelujah that power is already there but it's laying dormant waiting for the time hallelujah hallelujah for the light to shine upon it that seed is there but it's dormant when the light shines upon it he comes forth amen amen just like the new birth but we're not talking about New Birth we're talking about fullness of the power of the third pool that's what we're talking amen hallelujah now watch and then brother bam goes on to tell us amen Shalom message shom 1964 we all know what the third pool is we all to understand that and I think it'll just lay DM in see It'll lay dorm in for a little while until that great hour of persecution comes on then it'll speak then it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure hallelujah hallelujah now when we when we go here brother sister we find out that brother bam said and feast of the trumpets that that word becoming flesh is what becomes light when the prophet wasn't announcing that he was coming anymore he said he's here there's one Among Us he says can't you see amen that there's one in our midst can't you see that he's revealing himself can't you see that it's the Lord himself that has descended from Heaven amen amen yes sir and has revealed himself brother that was the sign Elohim El revealing himself speaking the word with Revelation revealing the sign then revealing the secrets then that power promised to come again in another cycle to Quicken Sarah hallelujah amen and give her dunam power to give birth to Isaac the promised word the promised son brother those things are true because that power has come back in this hour to Quicken Sarah the church that wasn't ready when Abraham was ready you understand Hallelujah if you it if if you find that place of identification then you'll know exactly the hour that we're living now watch what the prophet says amen we're we're here in the message uh there's a man here that can turn on the light he brother bam is going to show us how that there is scriptures that they were laying darant for a long time until the time come for light to shine on that scripture and it become manifest when it become manifest it was in in a in a people it was in a person it was in a prophet it was in a church you understand what I'm saying that's the last phase of that light hallelujah hallelujah now watch in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light God help me keeps jumping back to the beginning of the page amen hallelujah all right there's a man here that can turn on the light paragraph 102 he says on on the day of Pentecost when that light that that shine when the Holy Ghost had come Isaiah the 28th chapter said precept must be upon precept line upon line here a little one there a little for with stammering lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people this is the rest this is the Sabbath amen amen and all of this they would not hear they walked away they wagged their tails but when the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon those people they acted like drunk men and women staggering under the impact of the Holy Spirit they walked away and wagged their heads and they said this people is drunk full of new wine it was absolutely the light the word that had been prophesied made manifest that was the light for that hour Hallelujah you see because Jesus when he was manifesting the word he said I am the light of the world amen amen amen but then he told the disciples this light is going to come inside of you and ye shall be the light of the world and you don't put a light under a bush you don't you don't hide it under a table you don't put it in a corner is that what he said he said put it in the middle of the room that it can Shine the whole room all around it and this is what I want to say here when light reveals itself brother it doesn't hide itself did you catch what I just said it does not hide itself it makes itself known that light he said a city with light is put on the top of a hill To Shine from that place hallelujah hallelujah when light truly comes it's not to be hid brother amen amen because that light is going to cause an effect to others that are in darkness amen amen that's why that light brother say it has to be shined it has to be shown in Dark Places is that right he said when we come to service like this questions and answers how many you heard brother BR say this he said here in the Tabernacle he said there's a lot of light spiritually speaking amen you can Want To Shine Your Light here said that's okay that's fine we come to worship God we come to praise we come receive from him but where you really shine light is in Dark Places amen amen amen is that what the prophet said so if True Light of the word is shining in your soul brother it's got to shine you cannot hide that light if that light is there that light is burning that light is burning it's burning to shine in Dark Places do you understand because brother if not it is just a little water heater flame amen amen nobody hardly ever sees it do you see the water heater Flame the boiler flame you see that flame brother first of all is locked up in a little room amen and then it's inside of the water heater then then it's got a protective glass amen where you can barely see it if you open the thing you see it we're not here to for that light has to shine the flame is not just to heat up water amen hallelujah brother bam said amen we cannot be warn by a painted fire Hallelujah there's got to be real fire what if somebody's dying with hypothermia amen and you show him a beautiful picture flame big fire that some people made a long time ago when when there was temperatures dropped so low that they were freezing to death and here you have a person right in front of you about to die from hypothermia and you said look at this beautiful picture you see that fire there you see all that people there that fire saved them from their coldness Hallelujah you think that will do that person any good he needs the same fire that saved them people over over there not in a picture he needs it right there where they're at you understand that's the thing friends and we're not talking about emotion brother we're talking about word being manifest in your life that's light now watch brother benam he goes on to say here how that that same light when it was revealed in the day of Pentecost it was in human beings is that right that was the light shining forth that Peter could say this is that that's in the scripture Hallelujah you see he wasn't just under some emotion or some influence he was under the scriptural light because Jesus said he that does not speak are you hear me Jesus said this he that does not speak according to the law and the prophets what did Jesus say has no life amen in him what's the law it's the word what's the prophets the word hallelujah Jeremiah Isaiah Ezekiel that's the law and the prophet he that does not speak he that does not speak he that does not testify he that does does is not in the channel of the law and the prophets has no light in him he can say what he wants he can do what he wants but if it's not according to the word that's not light friends that's artificial light and brother Bram said the greatest robbery Robo that ever existed was made in England amen a train robbery is that righten the prophet say that it was done by a false light and he said the greatest robbery that the devil has done to the church is Rob them with false light why would you want false light if you can have real light and the devil's a thief and a robber you understand see it's got to be according to the word friends and then you know when the Fulfillment comes what that is like Peter amen amen this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel amen hallelujah that's light when the Holy Ghost fell he says was the light upon the word and the Word was made manifest then it become light he is the light he is the light that we should follow he is the only light the Angels found light and followed it to him in all ages God has set forth so much of his word for that particular age and God always send somebody that that word can get into and show the light that every age it does the same it always does that Hallelujah Hallelujah you see that now brother amen when that light hallelujah amen begins to shine there this is what we have to understand this light that is come to us is the final light is a light that this darkness of Leia that went into total darkness they cannot comprehend this they cannot perceive this light because this light is an eternal light it's the breaking of another day that we still have not entered into yet fully and literally Hallelujah but spiritually and in the inner man has entered into that day amen amen now watch brother bham says in this in this quote here he quotes the very scripture that we read St John 5 how they were willing to rejoice in the light of John amen amen but Jesus was a greater light see let let me ask you something brother who in this message that believes the message won't Rejoice that God's in a prophet you ask anybody amen amen they can Rejoice about that but when it comes of the message and the Prophecies of that message and what it was to fulfill and what was to take place today and what God is doing now 2016 amen amen that's where the trouble starts everybody can Rejoice God s a prophet I Rejoice too hallelujah amen amen but I can also Rejoice with what God's doing now because I know that go that that Prophet that God sent said that these things would be that's the continuation of the light you understand Hallelujah the light didn't stop in 65 the light is still Shining and it's getting greater and greater and greater because this message is still alive Hallelujah this message didn't die brother but it's got to shine in the heart of a people and that word has got to be made flesh she is him Hallelujah the two shall be one bone of his bonees of his Flesh Light of his light power of his power amen amen the word may flesh is the light of the age you believe that hallelujah hallelujah see amen but brother bam says here now the people looking at Jesus they said this man born illegitimate see his father his mother is this and that but they didn't know the scriptures they would have known the scriptures they would have known him he said so they said we are Moses disciples that's in chapter 5 St John he said said if You' known Moses you'd know me for Moses wrote of me and still too blind to see it see how humble away from all the crews and the denominations and the Creeds and everything God moved right in flesh in the form of a man see so the bride she must be identified with him the same way Prophet is saying that the same thing that Jesus passed through in his experience the bride must be identified with him amen amen in that same manner now watch this the prophet goes on to say that this this identification in the bride will make her one with the word see Hallelujah she must be identified with him we are invited to be Children of the light that we walk in the light and after we walk in the light we come to a place that we are established in the light and we sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and now just like just like light couldn't do nothing to those that sat in darkness now Darkness can't do nothing to those that sit in light am Hallelujah hallelu it can't shake them it can't move them it can't persuade them it can't separate them from the love that's in Christ Jesus neither death neither tribulation nor sickness nor things above nor things below no tribulation no good times no bad times nothing can separate us from the love that is in Christ hallelujah hallelujah and that is the Capstone the love is the Capstone and when you come to that Capstone to that perfect man amen amen your vision is not short the Bible says and he that has these things shall never fall is that the Bible am hallelujah oh my hallelujah what did the prophet say this bride will not fall why why won't she fall because according to the Bible when she comes to Perfection you cannot fall that statement of the Prophet as a scriptural backing brother Glory I love the word of God Amen see and then he says here amen oh my Hallelujah okay ween he says the light the word Vindicated shows that it is the light of the hour that's how we know he is the light because he is the light manifesting itself in flesh GL see there's going to come a time where the darkness because of this light listen to this getting brighter and brighter why is the light getting brighter because there's Believers receiving the word and you're receiving the revelation of the word that becomes light so if you receive you're receiving light he's receiving light he's receiving light it's getting brighter amen amen you understand and if the light is getting brighter and brighter and bigger and bigger brother bam said that is causing something you know that you know what that is causing he tells us in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light he said what that is causing is Darkness to get together too amen darkness is also Gathering let's say that this whole room room here was totally pitch black and dark amen and the little light begins to shine back here in the corner somewhere close to where this picture is right here hallelujah amen amen and that light begins to shine amen amen see you will see that light very clear you'll know exactly where it is but when the light gets greater begins to shine more and more the darkness is being pushed amen out until there'll come a time that all the darkness that was in the whole room would only just be in one part back there all gathered together understand spiritually speaking that's what's taking place now Hallelujah if not then this message of the prophet of God ain't having no effect in nobody but I believe it is it's having an effect somebody amen hallelujah glor and it's getting greater and greater and another one is catching light another one is catching light hallelujah amen and light is gathering together and darkness is gathering Gathering their forces of Darkness cannot reach resist that and that's what causes the squeeze amen what causes it that the light is growing this same word is what's going to cause the persecution the same light growing is what going to cause Darkness amen amen to bring this persecution against the bride of Christ amen you see how how clear that is now brother bam says he says now this light getting greater and greater see there is coming a time yes sir that will be very dark look like they're going to force us everyone all these you see their Proclamation going out all these little churches and things are got to come in now you've got to come in or they're going to close you up they're going to make it now we want to hit that real hard tonight when I get to this time see we're going to close up you have to be one of them or not you'll either enter into that or you can't do nothing you can't even buy or sell that's it you Daron to pray for the sick if you're caught ministering to any sick or any person with any spiritual thing in there you are subject to federal law to be executed that's exactly right you see you know that that's right it's in their papers yes sir you cannot do it you have to belong to the cult brother let me tell you something you better get Christ sure in your heart now there's coming a time when you're really going to need it see you're out then when the seal is put on she's there for good see then you don't do it don't you believe that stuff you get right in Christ now the word yes sir vindicates the word and shows that that is the light of the hour that's how we know that it is light because the light becomes flesh and these people that cannot identify the light they go into darkness they are they are good people not bad people they're good people but they are mistaken just like Joseph and Mary very fine people but real mistaken what was it God used a 12-year-old boy to show that the word has to stay pure exactly what it was what it said the first place it was a virgin Joseph was not not his father and thinking that he was with them when they joined the churches and so forth it wasn't so but to the elect it's different see those others are in darkness I could stay on that for another hour but to the elect something precious is taking place to them that are called saints of God I say to you I say to the elect to the elect lady shalom shalom good morning God's peace the hour is here if I could had been back there in the days when the world was created and if I could have looked down the whole thing and seen and the father would have said to me what day do you want to live I would have said right now this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom oh the real Church listen oh the real Church of the Living God listen oh the real Church of the Living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the Gospel being listen being Vindicated among them hello being at among them hallelujah hallelujah what is the light it's the Vindication of the spoken word something that has already been spoken when light shines upon it it becomes flesh it becomes manifest it's the Vindication that is the light Hallelujah that's why we said this morning you can have the spoken word and still not have light Hallelujah yes sir although that's what gives you light but brother and sister if you're catching what the spirit is telling us you understand what I'm saying amen you can have the spoken word and not have life because the light is the Vindication of the spoken word it's the manifestation of that spoken word that word that was spoken brought to pass let there be light and it is light and that is the interpretation that is the Vindication that is the manifestation Hallelujah Hallelujah let everybody interpret what they want brother it's time to stop interpreting and start manifesting amen no no I don't believe that I believe it means this amen amen then what you believe it is will have to be made manifest amen if not it's a false light and there's a robbery a big one taking place with false light amen amen he says this is the light Rise and Shine for that light has come the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day he had the word manifested the Bible words for this day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we're living good morning means peace darkness is gathering what's it gathering for to show the light rise and shine Isaiah 6 verse one the light has come to you that's that's the reason that I can say shalom the light has come God's peace to the elect woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world called and ordained the rest of them will never see it they'll never know nothing about it Jesus said no one will come to me except my father draws him first there stood Judas and the light shining up here back in his heart was darkness and there was a dark seed and when The Showdown come Darkness showed itself but that little woman awful of sin and Blackness but there was a predestinated seed D down in her soul and when that light come it scattered the darkness and she said we know that when Messiah comes he will do these things Jesus said I am he hallelujah hallelujah but Judas doubted it yet list he walked in the light for a season amen see the spirit is still continuing from this morning what we read Isaiah 9 them that walk in darkness will be brought out of the prison house house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ Light has shine and those that walked in darkness they come out but Matthew 4 those that sat in darkness sat in darkness he began to preach repentance and later on we find out they repented not therefore he said you have exalted yourself to up to heaven you shall be brought down to Heaven amen amen is that the word hallelujah now watch here he said said up here's a light here it doesn't matter it's the light down here that counts the light up here listen the light up here like Judas it will walk with the light and fellowship with the light I'm quoting the prophet and everything else see it can walk with the light did Judas walk with the light was he a part of the ministry Hallelujah he walked with the light he he was part of the ministry of the light amen he fellowship with the light he was from the church of the light amen but when the real power of God comes in it can't come back to the dead seed it'll reflect off in a denomination but when it's back down here a genuine predestinated seed when that light comes down in here it shows all the darkness away from you and puts you in fellowship with Christ he was the one who gave you life before the foundation of the world wise you'll never see it that's what God said so that's why I say to the predestinated seed shalom shalom rise and shine light has sprung up hallelujah hallelujah light has come thy light has come the glory of the Lord has risen upon me because we're near the end now he is giving the light this light of another day listen to this amen God is light is that right amen the word the light Vindicated again so that you can see manifestations of the promise of God for this day search the scriptures John 5 for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of the day that we're living in what is the light of the day what is the light of the day what the Bible promised for this day made manifest that's the light no wonder Jesus rebuked them for not believing John Hallelujah he was the light because the prophet said he would come and there he was the manifested light they didn't see it when he come they didn't understand it they thought he was the Messiah amen did they did they think John the Baptist was the Messiah they couldn't identify what the light was he was the light of the Prophecies of Isaiah but not even the disciples were able to see that amen they were still influenced by what the scribes said amen amen they still had the influence of the different fellowships and the different churches that they used to go to amen amen hallelujah although they were already following Christ although they were they were with his ministry they said but the scribes say that Elias brother bam says that even the disciples missed it they missed the light when they were shining amen what do we read right here St John 5 that John was a burning and Shining Light and they were willing to rejoice in that light but not really understanding what the thing was watch here he says Jesus rebuked them for not believing John he was the light because the prophet said he would come and there he was the manifested light they didn't see it they didn't understand it they thought he was the Messiah they thought something else and this and the other they failed to see it and Jesus come on and said two lights can't shine at the same time Hallelujah there listen there can't be Church light and God light at at the same time it's got to be God's light putting out the church light and that's exactly what is taking place today amen the whole time he's talking about a new day a Breaking of a new day oh brother I'm not going to have time to finish this tonight because we got to go back to Genesis 1 amen amen and we got to see how God sees a day not how we see a day not how Pagan tradition has taught us what a day is we say a day begins in the morning and ends at night not God you know that's the Bible you know that the Bible says and the evening and the morning was the first day read that in the Bible and the evening and the morning was the second day and the evening and the morning was the third day go back to Genesis 1 and see how God sees a day that's why there's a lot of confusion in the [Music] message that's why there's no understanding of what we're coming into in this hour amen amen because this light begins in the evening amen amen in the evening there shall be light and then he said to the bride good morning Hallelujah he doesn't say good night because one day starts in the evening with him and then it comes into the morning for the bride you understand what I'm saying in the evening time there shall be light but when brother bam breaks it into the morning [Music] he says that will come fully in the Millennium Millennium yes sir in the message God's power to transform 1965 the prophet said that day back there in Genesis he said look at the sixth day the prophet taught this amen amen Genesis Genesis chapter 1 shows you something very very clear and if you see that Genesis 131 God saw everything that was he made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the six day see when did he create man when did he create man in the sixth day amen Genesis 126 and 27 is that right amen did he create a man that man that he created in the sixth day hallelujah hallelujah brother sister are you getting it he created a man not a baby a man in Perfection Hallelujah on the sixth day he made him first is that right and after he made him he took out of him and made a perfect woman yes sir in the sixth day oh brother when it come for the morning of the seventh day listen to what I'm saying that's when they fell and brother bam says in the quote that I was just quoting amen I'm not reading it quoting it from memory brother says in God's power to transform that is what God is bringing us back to and brother bam says in that he says back to what to the seventh morning that's what he says type in your message query sth morning see what he said because the evening and the morning is the first day but the evening brother hallelujah hallelujah the evening light has come 6,000 years and in the 6,000 years at the end time he makes a perfect man you understand he didn't he didn't bring the the statue of a perfect man back there in Ephesus or or the perfect man come in the sixth day you understand it was a man in our day brother in the in the last days you understand before the Millennium 6,000 years the seventh day is the millennium he brought him to Perfection but the light of that new world we don't receive in the new world we receive it here hallelujah and that's why spiritually the inner man is receiving that light now that light is quickening our soul the predestinated gene that's why he said shalom shalom unto the bride unto the predestinated seed that is receiving that light of the seventh day you understand brother sister this is what Darkness can't comprehend stand to your feet tonight he says this there can't be Church light and God light at the same time it's got to God's light has got to put out Church light that is exactly what is taking place today God is separating churchism from his life of the promised word of this hour that we are living in that's the truth friend you might not want to believe that but you just wait to find out see if it's so or not don't wait you better get in now while there's still a chance oh brother this is that light that has come and what did he say the Church of the Living God ought to be burning with the light of the age hallelujah hallelujah brother it's it's something on the inside that is taking place it's something that has come it's the breaking of a new day but for our souls remember brother brandham said that that star amen amen the evening star is a messenger hurling is coming the light is coming the light is coming is that right he says and then the sun rises in the morning you see what's today Sunday right Sundays Sunday's light Naturally Speaking did not come first it was Saturday's darkness that was still come over passed over which Darkness began Saturday evening you understand about 8:00 right it's getting dark now so Saturday around 8 it begin to get dark right and that Darkness did not stop in Saturday it went into Sunday amen amen and all the morning Sunday there is still darkness is uh Saturday's Darkness until there come a time that that Darkness from yesterday went away and the light of today begin to shine Hallelujah the evening and the morning was the seventh day you don't find that in the Bible you just find from day one to day six the evening and the morning was the sixth day and you keep reading and you never find in the scripture after that that it said and the evening and the morning was the seventh day is not there it's a mystery Hallelujah that's this hour because in the sixth day they were made they were going to go together into the seventh day that's why brother brandom said Christ Myster of God revealed now in the restoration God rose up Adam again is that right Christ is that right then what's the what's the what's the second fold of his mystery the bride is that right Ephesians 5 he said this is not I'm not speaking of husband and wife he said he said I'm speaking of the mystery between Christ and his church is that what he said Ephesians 5 he says and then these two amen amen will be taken to the Millennium Back to Eden in the seventh day hallelujah amen brother sister that is the light that we're receiving in this hour this light cannot be comprehended because it's in the holy of holies the the light that was in the candlesticks amen amen it was at the altar that light brother Bram said could be turned off that light amen amen in the candlesticks could be turned off that was church light amen but he said what is taking place now is that God is separating Church light from God's light he said in the sh presence in the holy of holies Beyond the Veil there was always light Hallelujah there was an outer court that was the light of the of the outside if it rain if it got cloudy no more light amen then there was a light of the candles that if they would turn off no more light amen amen and let me say according to the Bible and according to the prophets and according to the lunar eclipse it turned off brother totally there's not one flame in them candlesticks anymore it's completely turned off not one little flame in the seventh Candlestick no sir it's done brother bram's said it went into total darkness but when you pass that and you come into the holy of holies he said there is a light that always was there that was a supernatural light a light not of this world of another world hallelujah hallelujah let us bow our heads to pray amen as we bow our heads let us see this light that has come to Quicken us Quicken our soul bring us into the breaking of a new day brother Ram says this as the musicians come he says to the church to the bride that is the reason that I say shalom shalom to them is because that it's God's peace that's what I want to bring to you see not to look back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something laying ahead of us where the years that has been the joy that we've looked forward to pressing towards the coming of that great light and now we can see it now we can see that light of that day breaking over the horizontal realm listen it's breaking between Mortal and immortality imort we see it breaking between heavens and earth from Earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal Earth that shall never pass away shalom shalom unto the bride it's light time coming for the Believers but gross Darkness for the people oh brother sisters amen hallelujah you understand amen this is see amen this is so profound it it's so beautiful he says again good morning how do you do it's breaking day Church darkness is upon the people but it's good morning to the church listen to what he says Christ is appearing Among Us amen shalom shalom hallelujah hallelujah shalom shalom when we see Darkness settling Darkness just before the day we know the morning star is hanging Yonder to introduce the coming son it always is darkest just a few minutes before the day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before the day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning shalom shalom that's him Among Us his word being identified the great day is fixing a break when the morning breaks Eternal bright and fair his chosen ones Shall Gather to their home beyond the sky when the road is Called Up Yonder I'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there shalom Shalom good morning peace be unto you the darkness is separating itself from the light God's causing it the light is doing it the light is expressing itself in such a way until Darkness has to congregate together they had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so it's condense itself and they do that by putting the church together in the world Council of churches uniting it with Pagan darkness when they do so firmly disagree with one another but yet they have to get together to make night to come upon the people Isaiah 6 verse one says arise and shine for th light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon me the light is Vindicated again the like Vindicated again God's word so that you can see God manifesting his promise made for this day amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you believe that tonight you believe that there's there's there there's Darkness Gathering also But Here We Are Tonight brothers and sisters under the light of the word being gathered amen and that light is shining into our soul the Inner Man hallelujah hallelujah

Sanctified has already been filled with the Holy Ghost and after that it comes into that Perfection Faith virtue Temperance patience oh it begins to come up oh into that Capstone into that Perfection

this is that hour this is a Time the evening and the morning is the seventh day not just coming into the Millennium Place but in this evening we are receiving that light we're receiving it hallelujah hallelujah oh yes that's why there was always a mystery on the sixth day when the children of Israel were in the wilderness and they were gathering bread Mana from Heaven every day they had to gather only for that day cuz if they kept it for the next day it would rot but on the sixth day on the sixth day on the sixth day hallelujah hallelujah Moses commanded them by the word of the Lord gather
