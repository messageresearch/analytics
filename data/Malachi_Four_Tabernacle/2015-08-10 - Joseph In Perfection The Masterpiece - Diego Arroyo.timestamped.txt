[9:46] desire in our
[9:47] hearts to really receive from you
[9:50] tonight Lord may you help us Quicken us
[9:54] father and Lord May our attention be set
[9:57] upon Thy
[9:58] Word
[10:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:03] Christ amen am may be
[10:06] seated we find
[10:09] Jacob blessing
[10:12] Joseph giving the
[10:15] prophecy over his life giving him
[10:19] prophetic
[10:21] utterance showing
[10:23] that he is
[10:28] seen he is seeing what he is
[10:32] speaking amen he is in a vision
[10:37] realm he is in the realm of
[10:40] Revelation he is in the realm of
[10:42] vision and as he seen how many times we
[10:46] know brother brandom uh we have heard
[10:48] him or seen him on
[10:52] video how we see him how he's seeing
[10:55] something in a
[10:57] vision and he says I see
[11:00] this and this I see this and this
[11:04] because he is speaking what he is seeing
[11:07] in the vision and this is what
[11:10] Jacob this is the kind of
[11:13] anointing that Jacob was
[11:16] under in Genesis
[11:19] 49 and he is blessing his 12
[11:23] sons when he comes to
[11:26] Joseph he he begins to proph
[11:29] under
[11:31] Vision amen of this Great
[11:35] Vine amen that Joseph is or a great
[11:39] Branch
[11:41] amen it's the same word that is used for
[11:46] the what they made in the Feast of
[11:51] Tabernacles Leviticus chapter
[11:54] 23
[11:56] 26 and this is where uh this comes from
[12:00] it comes from the word
[12:04] Branch amen and that's why he is calling
[12:08] Joseph amen not only a
[12:13] branch first he says what Joseph is a
[12:15] branch
[12:17] amen and then he says he is a fruitful
[12:21] Branch amen by a
[12:24] well then he shows how that when this
[12:28] Branch becomes
[12:29] [Music]
[12:30] fruitful amen it begun it begins to go
[12:34] over the
[12:35] wall hallelujah hallelujah this is very
[12:39] tremendous amen and I hope we're
[12:42] spiritual
[12:43] enough to be able to
[12:46] catch amen what is in this great
[12:50] mystery brother said it's
[12:53] Christ revealed in his own word if you
[12:56] can't see Christ every verse in every
[13:00] personage of the
[13:02] Bible go back and read it again because
[13:06] there he is hidden but
[13:09] revealed in
[13:11] Simplicity and he is hidden in his word
[13:15] but he is
[13:16] revealed in his own word and Christ is
[13:21] the mystery of God
[13:24] revealed and within Christ there was
[13:27] another history another
[13:29] mystery that was hidden inside of him
[13:33] how many know what that was remember
[13:36] what brother R said he said inside of
[13:39] him was you inside of him was me inside
[13:44] of him was the bride inside of him was
[13:49] another mystery that was hidden so in
[13:52] other words if we find Christ then we
[13:55] can find
[13:57] ourselves hallelujah amen if we find him
[13:59] in the scripture we can find ourselves
[14:02] in him in the
[14:05] scripture you understand and that's why
[14:07] these types amen for instance we talk
[14:11] about
[14:12] Abraham amen Abraham is a type of priz
[14:16] is that right brother said when he went
[14:19] to go
[14:20] save his his nephew lost when he was in
[14:24] trouble he said I was a type of Christ
[14:27] going to save
[14:29] the human race when it's in trouble he
[14:33] said that wasn't Abraham that was Christ
[14:36] in
[14:37] Abraham the power of
[14:39] Salvation so Abraham is a type of
[14:42] Christ and then if you go further mam
[14:46] said there's never been a messenger to
[14:49] the last days with his name ending in H
[14:53] a.m amen seven letters Hallelujah the
[14:57] number of God six letters the number of
[15:00] Man Billy Graham but he really he really
[15:04] wasn't talking about Billy
[15:06] Graham he said he was down in Sodom but
[15:09] he was really saying
[15:12] Bram yes sir seven letter so when he
[15:16] talks about Abraham he's a type of
[15:19] Christ but he's also a type of the
[15:21] Prophet is that right but then he goes
[15:24] on and he
[15:25] says Abraham is a type of the believer
[15:29] was justified in Genesis 12 brought out
[15:33] of Bon he was Sanctified Genesis 15
[15:38] Hallelujah under the unconditional
[15:40] Cen is that right and under Genesis
[15:44] 17 it's the
[15:46] great the pcal power amen the baptism of
[15:51] the Holy Ghost and he said in the fourth
[15:54] stage amen Abraham as a Believer he sees
[15:58] the last
[16:00] to the Gentile world before the fire
[16:03] falls he says he says he sees
[16:07] El a
[16:10] prophet the
[16:13] last World hallelujah hallelujah yes sir
[16:18] so you see that when you take a person
[16:20] in the Bible and you type him he types
[16:24] Christ he types the prophet and he types
[16:27] you because the
[16:30] mystery of God revealed is Christ but
[16:35] the mystery of Christ is
[16:40] theah so when you see that when we're
[16:43] looking at here at
[16:44] Joseph he types Jesus is that
[16:47] right amen is he a type of Jesus is he
[16:51] the perfect man is he
[16:54] Perfection hallelujah hallelujah to God
[16:58] Amen
[16:59] is he the one in the midst of seven
[17:02] golden
[17:03] candlesticks Revelation
[17:06] one that's
[17:08] him that's
[17:11] Joseph glory to
[17:15] God now notice during this time there
[17:20] was a mystery
[17:22] unfolding in the days of Joseph what was
[17:25] that
[17:26] mystery amen that God God's
[17:29] predestinated
[17:31] plan it's always
[17:34] evolving it's always
[17:37] unfolding whether people recognize it or
[17:40] not and that is the reason why God's
[17:44] word it's always based on
[17:46] principles Hallelujah you as a Believer
[17:50] have to have principles and know the
[17:53] principles of God's word that's what
[17:56] brother R was trying to teach the
[17:58] Pentecost
[18:00] amen he was trying to show him
[18:03] principles he said the Pentecostal
[18:05] church is the church that's the most
[18:09] loose of all
[18:12] churches he said because they have no
[18:15] principle he said but God is wanting to
[18:18] bring the
[18:19] church to
[18:21] matur amen a people with
[18:24] principles of people that knows what the
[18:27] word say
[18:30] and we ain't
[18:31] depending upon how I feel what I think
[18:35] or how I look
[18:37] at there's got to be
[18:39] principles there's principles in a local
[18:43] assembly there's principles while the
[18:46] word is going forth he said the spirit
[18:49] of the
[18:50] prophets amen is subject to the
[18:53] prophet is that right so while the word
[18:57] is going forward he said the Holy Spirit
[19:01] working over there is for some to speak
[19:04] through
[19:05] somebody is that right is that a
[19:08] principle he said the Holy Ghost is
[19:10] speaking here and youve got to wait
[19:13] until he's finished speaking
[19:16] here right and when he finished here
[19:20] whatever he wants to do over
[19:21] there is that right those are principles
[19:26] that we have to know in the word of God
[19:30] because if not we're just loose we're
[19:33] just loose we do what we want oh I feel
[19:36] like this I feel like that but when we
[19:39] go to
[19:40] principles we tie our
[19:43] soul what the word
[19:45] say
[19:47] hallelujah this is what this message
[19:50] come to bring us it come to bring us
[19:53] principles in our home principles in our
[19:56] Liv principles in the church
[19:59] principles in our Christian
[20:01] walk amen solidly depending upon the
[20:05] word of
[20:06] God and when we see the principles of
[20:09] God we understand his
[20:12] mind we understand his mind we
[20:15] understand his plan Hallelujah huj and
[20:19] then we know that the same
[20:22] hand to God the same hand that's leading
[20:27] me listen the same hand that's leading
[20:32] us once in a while is going to spank
[20:37] us and then once in a while that same
[20:40] hand is going to pick us up and then
[20:44] that same hand is going to raise us up
[20:48] and then that same hand it's going to
[20:50] break
[20:51] [Applause]
[20:53] us and then that same hand is going to
[20:56] take the broken pieces and put them back
[21:01] together do you understand those are
[21:07] principles and when we don't understand
[21:10] principles we're loose we don't know we
[21:15] don't understand why this why that why
[21:19] am I going through this why does this
[21:21] have to be hallelujah hallelujah but
[21:24] when we understand principles we know
[21:26] it's the tender head of the
[21:30] Amen brother said the critics look back
[21:35] to the
[21:36] Inquisition where Christians
[21:40] were in
[21:41] Lion's in the great Roman
[21:44] circus and killed little children killed
[21:49] wives
[21:50] killed amen women and families ding for
[21:56] the cause of Christ
[21:59] so Anointed with the O
[22:02] anointing of
[22:04] sacrifice that history says that when
[22:07] those that were looking for the
[22:10] Christians passed by they would come out
[22:15] say we're right here hallelujah hallu
[22:19] they were so Anointed with
[22:23] thato they were willing to give their
[22:26] Liv Hallelujah

[22:47] miracles let his children go through
[22:50] that and die and stand there he said
[22:54] with his arms crossed and not do nothing
[22:58] he said the caral Mind does not
[23:01] understand amen that the seed has to
[23:06] fall

[23:46] doing you know that he's going to pick
[23:48] you up you know he'll never leave you
[23:52] never forsake you amen but you also know
[23:56] the other
[23:57] scriptures that say
[23:59] he that I love I and Hallelujah hallu so
[24:05] you know
[24:06] principles you're not just wanting one
[24:09] part of the
[24:10] pie Hallelujah you want the whole
[24:14] pie amen hallelujah to
[24:19] God and we noce thank Lord that this
[24:23] message
[24:26] teaches not only in Word word but
[24:30] indeed the very life of the prophet of
[24:34] God shows us God showing him
[24:40] principles and then him
[24:42] testifying of those things that we might
[24:46] see that
[24:48] it's not
[24:51] only God dealing with a person in the
[24:56] Bible how many understand understand
[24:59] that that when God
[25:01] dealt with Abraham in that certain way
[25:05] it wasn't only just for
[25:07] Abraham it was so that somebody
[25:10] else that's going through the same
[25:13] thing can see how God work with
[25:17] here right someone that can't have a
[25:20] child he can go back to Abraham and take
[25:24] that word and say God work there take
[25:28] that up and say that's for me is that
[25:31] right a woman like Sarah can go back to
[25:35] the Bible amen and see God did that for
[25:39] S it for
[25:42] me you see what I'm saying he he not
[25:45] only does that for the person that that
[25:49] is in the
[25:51] scene but it's
[25:54] Christ fulfilling that amen amen for
[25:58] future
[26:01] events Paul said in Corinthians 10 all
[26:05] of these things are for our
[26:09] example
[26:11] hallelujah amen hallelujah so we see
[26:16] then that even in the life of the
[26:19] Prophet many things God dealing with him
[26:23] is so that you in this age in this
[26:27] modern time
[26:29] amen we can look back and see that's the
[26:32] first grain of
[26:34] wheat amen that's a Son of
[26:37] God
[26:39] predestinated to this
[26:42] age and he's going through
[26:45] Tri he's going through things but look
[26:48] how God shows him and reveals to him and
[26:53] brings him
[26:55] amen this is why brothers and sister
[26:59] when we look at the principles of God
[27:03] brother said if we work a certain way if
[27:07] he worked a certain way back there when
[27:11] a certain
[27:13] situation rose up amen and he says and
[27:17] then the same
[27:18] situation Rises up over here he's got to
[27:22] act the same way he acted
[27:25] over is that right amen is that
[27:31] right Hallelujah now brother and
[27:35] sister when we're not we're not founded
[27:37] upon those
[27:39] principles we're we're we're not
[27:41] spiritual
[27:43] minded to go back and look for those
[27:47] things that we're going
[27:50] through in the word we think nobody ever
[27:55] went to what we're going to that's true
[27:59] we think that there's no
[28:02] examples that nobody understands us and
[28:05] that there's nothing in the
[28:07] word that can help
[28:10] us you see what I'm saying it shows our
[28:14] narrow
[28:16] mind amen but I believe that everything
[28:21] that the predestinated seed of is going
[28:25] through amen it's in the word of God
[28:30] hallelujah hallelujah that we can go
[28:32] back to the word and
[28:35] draw virtue from what God did in those
[28:40] times in those situations amen and say
[28:45] did it for him do it for me did it for
[28:49] her do it for me
[28:53] amen
[28:54] hallelujah you understand Glory
[28:58] look at the prophet he'd read Moses he'd
[29:02] see his ministry he'd see his
[29:05] birth
[29:06] see

[29:10] right
[29:12] Glory he go back to Abraham he see
[29:14] himself in

[29:20] see himself in Joshua he himself Ines he
[29:24] himself in Adam amen
[29:29] Hallelujah to God see
[29:33] in looking for a bride
[29:36] amen the word of God you understand and
[29:40] when we go back to the word there's
[29:44] parts of the life of mes that apply to
[29:49] you there parts of the life Jos that

[52:42] gospel every
[52:44] plant that my father did not
[52:47] plant amen shall be plucked up is that
[52:52] right and cast into the fire so who
[52:55] plants
[52:57] the
[52:59] father right who predestinated us the
[53:04] father from where from before the
[53:07] foundation of the
[53:12] world now notice
[53:15] Joseph is a fruitful
[53:18] Branch
[53:19] amen
[53:22] planted by the
[53:24] well you understand
[53:27] now notice brother when we look at this
[53:31] we begin to understand
[53:32] now all
[53:34] right then I can see how that is a type
[53:39] of us
[53:40] today the bride is by the
[53:44] well the spirit the prophet and the
[53:49] bride say come and drink from the water
[53:54] amen is that right amen all right look
[53:58] what brother Brown
[53:59] says in the message the
[54:02] Masterpiece he
[54:08] says
[54:10] Jacob means
[54:15] deceiver means deceiver that's what he
[54:18] was but it was God's
[54:20] grace that was with him but when it
[54:23] comes to
[54:24] Joseph there's nothing against
[54:29] him just one
[54:34] little for the
[54:37] foundation listen because the
[54:41] foundation must also be a
[54:49] masterpiece brother brother is
[54:53] saying that God laid the
[54:57] Foundation right like Michel
[55:00] Angelo for the
[55:02] foundation to build the
[55:06] Masterpiece right and then when he built
[55:09] the
[55:10] Masterpiece he struck it
[55:13] amen right he told it to speak well look
[55:17] what brother R is saying here brother R
[55:20] saying the
[55:22] foundation was the
[55:24] Patriarchs amen amen
[55:27] Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[55:31] Joseph that was the
[55:33] foundation he said so the
[55:36] foundation brother the
[55:39] foundation amen when it came to its
[55:44] Perfection Joseph had one little
[55:48] scratch because the foundation must also
[55:54] have a scratch in
[55:57] it you see what I'm saying because the
[56:01] Masterpiece what made it a
[56:04] masterpiece brother said what made it
[56:07] the
[56:08] master was the strike on the
[56:11] knee right amen so the
[56:16] foundation is a masterpiece
[56:18] also because Joseph has a little
[56:24] scr Hallelujah you see now look he says
[56:30] he
[56:31] says that was when his he told his
[56:36] father the
[56:39] prophet so Joseph's
[56:42] father was a
[56:45] prophet oh my hallelujah
[56:49] hallelujah glory to God and his father
[56:54] how many he know that the prophet said
[56:57] you are my
[56:58] children in the
[57:03] gospel
[57:05] Hallelujah and if we are his children
[57:08] remember in the days of
[57:10] Jesus Amen Mary came and his brothers he
[57:14] said hey
[57:15] Jesus your mother wants to talk to you
[57:19] and your
[57:22] brothers
[57:23] Glory he turned around and said
[57:26] who is my mother who is my brother who
[57:30] is my father but them that do the
[57:33] will my father
[57:36] is
[57:38] hallelujah oh brother because the Bible
[57:42] says that even Jesus own carnal flesh
[57:48] brothers did not believe in
[57:54] him amen amen now
[57:57] look right here we
[58:00] see
[58:01] amen he
[58:03] said Joseph's
[58:05] father he told the prophet say to
[58:10] Pharaoh that your people are cattle
[58:14] raisers not Shepherds because a Shepherd
[58:19] is an
[58:20] Abomination to the
[58:22] Egyptians but when the old prophet
[58:26] before Pharaoh he said your servants are
[58:30] herdsmen so it scratched
[58:33] it it was a little scratch in the
[58:42] Masterpiece it says that's why it still
[58:46] makes it the
[58:48] Masterpiece the foundation is
[58:51] laid through faith love Grace and
[58:57] Perfection amen
[58:59] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Jose
[59:05] Hallelujah a
[59:08] masterpiece the foundation now listen
[59:12] Hallelujah he says
[59:13] here I read this uh this
[59:17] morning she is
[59:20] smitten from the church from the church
[59:23] body smitten with her
[59:27] master for the same purpose she is the
[59:31] word just the
[59:33] same as
[59:35] Joseph was
[59:38] smitten from his
[59:40] brother amen because he was the word so
[59:46] notice that in the days of Joseph he was
[59:50] the
[59:52] word hallelujah am Pharaoh wasn't the
[59:55] word
[59:56] [Applause]
[59:57] glory amen the rest of them work the
[1:00:00] word hallelujah Joseph was the
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:08] word amen and because he was the
[1:00:13] word Jesus was smitten from his
[1:00:18] Brethren because he was the word and the
[1:00:23] bride is smitten from the church because
[1:00:28] she is the word there's your
[1:00:32] stages again
[1:00:35] exactly hallelu he says the the word

[1:01:00] said that the
[1:01:03] crown would be on his head Joseph him
[1:01:08] that was
[1:01:11] separate from his
[1:01:13] brother remember what we said this
[1:01:16] morning amen that that
[1:01:19] meant set
[1:01:21] apart
[1:01:23] Nazarite for a specific work
[1:01:26] am but notice that he says the
[1:01:31] crown of the head of him Hallelujah you
[1:01:37] see huj because it's in the head it's

[1:22:44] talking about what's that amen
[1:22:48] hallelujah hallelujah that's where
[1:22:50] rejection
[1:22:52] comes that's where
[1:22:55] hallelujah hallelujah amen but those
[1:23:00] dreams he doesn't ask
[1:23:02] for he doesn't say I want to
[1:23:06] dream sheep
[1:23:09] stars and everyone bowing to
[1:23:12] me right he doesn't say that it's God
[1:23:17] that gives him those
[1:23:21] dream amen does he want the dream
[1:23:27] dream does he make the
[1:23:29] dreams manufacture
[1:23:33] them oh no the dreams are given
[1:23:36] sovereignly by
[1:23:39] God and all he can do is just speak what
[1:23:43] he sees in the
[1:23:46] dream oh
[1:23:49] glory amen all we can do is just speak
[1:23:55] what we see in the
[1:23:57] word hallelujah what is sovereignly
[1:24:02] given said
[1:24:04] Revelation is
[1:24:07] Sovereign Hallelujah now notice when he
[1:24:12] looks in the stages of his
[1:24:15] life the
[1:24:17] visions that they
[1:24:21] reject is
[1:24:23] not
[1:24:25] and the condition listen this
[1:24:28] is I'm be closing with
[1:24:31] this listen close the
[1:24:35] Visions the
[1:24:37] dreams that his Breen
[1:24:41] reject are not
[1:24:44] dreams
[1:24:46] visions of what are going
[1:24:49] on right then and
[1:24:53] there no
[1:24:54] those are dreams visions of his life in
[1:24:59] the future amen but he already seeing
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:09] it am he's already catching a
[1:25:15] revelation before it comes to
[1:25:18] pass amen amen and that's what they
[1:25:23] reject
[1:25:26] that's what they re they say how can it
[1:25:29] be look look at
[1:25:32] Joseph we're going to bow down look at
[1:25:35] him it's just a
[1:25:37] boy you see because in their minds all
[1:25:42] they can see is the
[1:25:45] present is what's happening there J
[1:25:48] condition but Joseph's
[1:25:51] dreams and Visions brother
[1:25:54] they're looking to his
[1:25:58] predestination they're looking to his
[1:26:02] position
[1:26:04] in right hand
[1:26:10] ofth but listen brother this is a this
[1:26:13] is a great
[1:26:15] lesson hallelu and the great lesson
[1:26:19] is that
[1:26:22] afterwards Joseph
[1:26:26] understands that all this was for a
[1:26:30] purpose and when that time
[1:26:36] comes of economic
[1:26:39] recession it's in it's in the story of
[1:26:43] Joseph you know what the story of Joseph
[1:26:46] says read it it's
[1:26:49] strong that's why I believe this subject
[1:26:52] is real deep
[1:26:55] because the story of Joseph
[1:26:57] says now listen to me
[1:27:00] now that when the time of depression
[1:27:06] came
[1:27:09] starvation amen amen they
[1:27:13] came to the Kingdom of
[1:27:16] Egypt and they said we want bread
[1:27:20] because
[1:27:22] money the Bible says our money
[1:27:28] fails in other words money wasn't worth
[1:27:34] nothing you believe there's coming a
[1:27:36] repeat of
[1:27:38] it is that going to happen
[1:27:41] again is is these dollars
[1:27:44] going are they going to have
[1:27:49] value no
[1:27:51] sir these the these these $100
[1:27:55] me a a't
[1:28:00] trash it's coming a time like
[1:28:03] that you understand what I'm
[1:28:06] saying amen amen but in that
[1:28:10] time it shows that
[1:28:12] Joseph had the had the spirit of
[1:28:17] Christ at first he was a little
[1:28:21] angry right but but
[1:28:25] then he gave him
[1:28:28] bread because he was under that
[1:28:32] Authority he gave to his
[1:28:35] Brethren that I rejected
[1:28:39] him he gave him bread because he had
[1:28:43] bread
[1:28:45] amen hallelujah he had a
[1:28:49] place Hallelujah where everything else
[1:28:53] fails this doesn't
[1:28:56] fail in this
[1:28:58] Kingdom amen does not depend on the
[1:29:02] economy of the world it doesn't depend
[1:29:05] on the stores of this
[1:29:08] world
[1:29:10] Amen brother Brown said the church got
[1:29:14] the quot brother Brown said the church
[1:29:17] has got to come to a
[1:29:19] place to
[1:29:21] reproduce the Loaves and Fishes
[1:29:26] again hallelujah huj amen hallelujah yes
[1:29:31] brother and sister this is the time
[1:29:34] hallelujah hallelujah that when we come
[1:29:38] into these
