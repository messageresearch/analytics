[52:23] privilege because we know
[52:25] that these privileges one day will soon
[52:27] be
[52:30] taken but until until then we're
[52:33] striving
[52:35] and we're under
[52:37] preparation we're under expectation and
[52:42] prayer amen for that final
[52:45] Deliverance because in that time we have
[52:48] a
[52:49] promise amen as we seen this
[52:52] morning that which we have seen
[52:56] temporarily will be manifested in the
[52:58] fullness of its
[53:00] power amen it may lay dormant for a
[53:04] while but brother that seed is receiving
[53:07] the Rays of
[53:09] light is being
[53:12] gered amen that one day it'll burst
[53:16] forth the fullness of that
[53:19] life Amen brother said there will be a
[53:22] mighty marching
[53:24] Army
[53:25] amen an invisble
[53:27] army hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we
[53:32] believe that with all our
[53:34] heart amen so we go to the book of St
[53:42] John we want to read
[53:45] from verse
[53:47] three chapter three I'm
[53:51] sorry and we read here from verse 19
[53:56] 19 we read this uh at the end there this
[54:02] morning we want to pick it up
[54:06] there St John 3 ver
[54:10] 19 and this is the condemnation that
[54:13] light has come into the world and Men
[54:15] love Darkness rather than light because
[54:17] their deeds were
[54:24] evil
[54:26] how many understand a little more what
[54:28] that light is
[54:30] amen
[54:32] hallelujah it's the word of the
[54:35] hour when that
[54:38] word is revealed that's light
[54:43] shining making the Bible a new
[54:46] book the message of the hour shines upon
[54:50] the word and we see the
[54:53] Mysteries revealed amen amen that's
[54:56] light Hallelujah in the evening time
[54:59] there shall be
[55:01] light and and we can
[55:03] testify is not that there shall be light
[55:07] there is
[55:08] light amen shall be was a
[55:12] prophecy but there is is the
[55:16] Fulfillment amen amen glory to God and
[55:21] then we see how that
[55:22] light progresses from the revelation
[55:26] of what we're
[55:27] beholding to that light coming in
[55:31] US amen and we becoming one with that
[55:36] word that word becomes
[55:40] flesh that's the light of the
[55:42] age was it made flesh in the
[55:46] prophet amen
[55:49] amen and each one in their
[55:52] position each one in their portion
[55:56] each one as Paul said in the Book of
[55:59] Romans according to your Measure of
[56:04] Faith everyone has been given a
[56:07] Measure of Faith amen amen amen
[56:10] according to your measure amen according
[56:13] to your calling your
[56:15] position in the body of
[56:18] Christ it says here verse 20 for
[56:22] everyone that doth evil ha is the the
[56:25] light neither cometh to the light these
[56:27] his de should be
[56:35] reproved but he that does truth cometh
[56:38] to light that his these may be man made
[56:41] manifest they are R in
[56:49] God Amen let's turn to St John chapter
[56:53] 5
[56:55] we read
[56:57] from verses
[57:04] 33
[57:06] 533 ye sent unto John and he bear
[57:10] witness unto the
[57:15] truth but I received not testimony from
[57:18] men but these things I say that ye might
[57:21] be
[57:23] saved
[57:27] for remember we read this morning St
[57:30] John
[57:32] 1 remember
[57:34] that verse six what did it say there was
[57:37] a
[57:38] man sent from God
[57:41] right amen amen named
[57:44] John and he said he was not the
[57:48] light but he was sent to Bear
[57:53] witness of the life
[57:56] that everyone through his
[57:59] ministry might
[58:02] believe on
[58:04] him is that right brother that same
[58:08] Ministry has come in this
[58:10] hour but the difference in this ministry
[58:14] of the prophet of
[58:15] God is that he was the
[58:20] Forerunner giving witness that that
[58:22] light was to
[58:23] come when that light shined on the River
[58:28] Ohio the voice said as John the
[58:31] Baptist was forun s to forun my first
[58:34] coming you will
[58:37] forun your message will forun my second
[58:41] coming is that
[58:44] right and brother bam was always
[58:46] announcing there's one coming there's
[58:48] one
[58:50] coming amen and that's where all these
[58:52] eighth Messengers rise
[58:56] because they failed to
[58:58] realize amen that that
[59:01] Ministry come to a
[59:03] change from John the
[59:05] Baptist into the
[59:08] ministry of the son of man in the same
[59:12] man in the same
[59:15] Prophet amen see and when his ministry
[59:18] changed from Forerunner to the revealing
[59:21] of the son of
[59:23] man
[59:25] that was the Lord
[59:27] himself that descended from heaven with
[59:30] a shout that was the
[59:33] opening of the word that was the third
[59:36] pool him coming into the prophetic
[59:40] office amen there's no higher
[59:44] order to reveal the word than a prophet
[59:48] is that what he said anointed ones at
[59:50] the end time
[59:52] 1965 first Divine Healing second pool
[59:57] Discerning of the spirits third pool the
[1:00:01] opening of the word he said there's no
[1:00:03] higher
[1:00:05] office than a prophet that's why before
[1:00:10] that said I'm not in the
[1:00:12] office of a prophet amen but in order to
[1:00:17] open the
[1:00:18] word he had to come into that
[1:00:21] office amen and that was the third pool
[1:00:25] and when we see that
[1:00:27] Revelation brother that was the
[1:00:29] revealing of God
[1:00:32] himself revealing his own word Christ is
[1:00:35] the mystery of God
[1:00:38] revealed is that right Christ is
[1:00:42] revealed in his own word amen amen then
[1:00:47] we see that that's that light of the
[1:00:51] age amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:00:55] notice here as we continue to read verse
[1:01:01] 34 uh verse
[1:01:05] 35 he was a burning speaking of John a
[1:01:08] burning and a Shining Light and you were
[1:01:11] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[1:01:23] light but I have greater witness than
[1:01:25] that of John for The Works which the
[1:01:26] father have given me to finish the same
[1:01:29] works that I do bear witness of me that
[1:01:31] the father have sent
[1:01:42] me amen you may be
[1:01:44] seated God bless
[1:01:48] you we can continue to
[1:01:52] read uh you can continue to read
[1:01:55] it if you want to continue to study that
[1:01:57] little part
[1:02:00] there but chapter 5 is a tremendous
[1:02:05] chapter and we have uh spoke out of this
[1:02:09] before brother Bram
[1:02:13] mentions the message I have heard but
[1:02:16] now I
[1:02:18] see he speaks very clearly very
[1:02:23] reveal
[1:02:27] of verses 24 and
[1:02:30] 25 because uh speaks of the Son of God
[1:02:34] the voice of the Son of
[1:02:36] God the voice of the son of
[1:02:39] man and then he goes on to show
[1:02:44] us how that this uh one that had been
[1:02:48] sent from God he was he was
[1:02:53] announcing
[1:02:55] that there was one to
[1:02:57] come but when he
[1:02:59] came he said he is here there's one
[1:03:03] Among
[1:03:04] Us amen amen but when he saw him then he
[1:03:07] said behold the
[1:03:09] lamb is that right Amen brother
[1:03:13] Bram if you follow him see that that's
[1:03:17] I've been saying this a lot
[1:03:21] lately because it's important for us to
[1:03:23] understand
[1:03:26] that we don't just uh uh uh stay with
[1:03:29] one
[1:03:32] statement of the
[1:03:34] Prophet but in that certain
[1:03:38] statement speaking of a certain subject
[1:03:40] or a certain point or a certain
[1:03:46] scripture we we follow the
[1:03:49] prophet amen amen and we begin to find a
[1:03:53] pattern
[1:03:55] and that's the problem that many don't
[1:03:56] follow the
[1:03:58] prophet through the message because he
[1:04:01] always be adds
[1:04:04] more to that particular subject or to
[1:04:07] that particular
[1:04:10] scripture he he begins to add more to
[1:04:13] that and when you take what he said all
[1:04:17] through the message you find how the
[1:04:20] Revelation was opening more and
[1:04:23] more
[1:04:25] until he come to a perfect understanding
[1:04:28] of that
[1:04:30] scripture but it was only by
[1:04:34] experience not only by knowledge it was
[1:04:37] by
[1:04:39] experience and it for
[1:04:41] instance if we take the
[1:04:44] scriptures of St John
[1:04:48] 14:12 amen which is the scripture where
[1:04:51] Jesus said we we quoted it this morning
[1:04:55] where where Jesus said the works that I
[1:04:58] do he that believeth on me the works
[1:05:01] that I do shall he do also
[1:05:05] amen and I didn't I don't want to take a
[1:05:08] lot of time this morning to explain on
[1:05:11] that that's why I said if you know the
[1:05:13] message you know what I'm
[1:05:16] saying because in the earlier
[1:05:19] years when brother bam would quote that
[1:05:23] scripture he said the correct
[1:05:25] translation is not greater it's
[1:05:28] more how many heard brother Braham say
[1:05:32] that amen
[1:05:34] amen he said because no one can do
[1:05:37] greater than
[1:05:39] Christ he said but it's more of the same
[1:05:43] works because it's in his body around
[1:05:45] the
[1:05:47] world amen amen and it wasn't until
[1:05:53] 1959
[1:05:54] that brother bam had an
[1:05:57] experience in had Wright's mother's
[1:06:03] house wasn't har Wright's house it was
[1:06:05] her mother's
[1:06:07] house where he had the
[1:06:10] experience of the third
[1:06:13] pool operating for the first
[1:06:16] time for the first time on a human
[1:06:19] being because it was
[1:06:22] done amen for for animal
[1:06:26] life and for different
[1:06:29] things in' 64 I believe it
[1:06:33] was that it was used on the
[1:06:36] storm and things like that later on it
[1:06:39] was used for the
[1:06:42] tumor but up until
[1:06:44] 59 he had not used it on human
[1:06:49] being and for the first time we know the
[1:06:53] story that God himself came
[1:06:56] down a super
[1:06:58] anointing and told the prophet tell her
[1:07:01] to ask what she
[1:07:04] wants is that right and it would be
[1:07:06] given to her right there brother bam
[1:07:09] said God already
[1:07:11] knew amen what she was going to ask and
[1:07:14] God put that in her
[1:07:16] heart amen although she could have asked
[1:07:19] for a million dollars brother ROM
[1:07:22] said sir that's not fake she could have
[1:07:26] asked for that and they would have been
[1:07:28] right there brother B said she could
[1:07:31] have asked for the for for the restoring
[1:07:34] of the Youth of her
[1:07:38] parents he said that in the Holy Ghost
[1:07:41] series what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:07:44] for he said he said she could have
[1:07:47] asked for the
[1:07:50] restoration of the Youth of her parents
[1:07:53] body
[1:07:54] bodies of her sister that was
[1:07:59] lame amen said but all those things
[1:08:03] would have aged
[1:08:05] again would have got sick again the
[1:08:08] money would have
[1:08:10] disappeared amen but she said the right
[1:08:13] thing the
[1:08:15] salvation of her two boys is that right
[1:08:19] God knew that so by that experience
[1:08:24] brother Bram in
[1:08:27] 196 preached that day at
[1:08:30] Calvary is that right amen and in the
[1:08:33] message that day at
[1:08:35] Calvary he quotes St John
[1:08:39] 14:12 and for the first time he brings
[1:08:42] out more
[1:08:44] Revelation upon that same
[1:08:47] scripture and what does he say Jesus
[1:08:50] said Greater
[1:08:52] Works he says what are the the Greater
[1:08:54] Works he said to impart eternal
[1:08:59] life he said because when
[1:09:02] Jesus was here alive in the
[1:09:05] flesh he never saved no
[1:09:09] one because there was no
[1:09:13] salvation until
[1:09:15] after his death burial and
[1:09:19] Resurrection his blood had to be
[1:09:21] shed his life had to be given
[1:09:24] and he had to ascend to
[1:09:27] intercede for us then there
[1:09:31] salvation but while he was
[1:09:33] here in life there was no
[1:09:38] salvation so he said Greater
[1:09:42] Works is what the apostles
[1:09:46] did Amen in the book of
[1:09:49] Acts when 3,000
[1:09:52] Souls came to Christ
[1:09:55] Chu he said and then 5,000
[1:09:58] more he said the
[1:10:00] apostles
[1:10:03] imparted eternal
[1:10:05] life Hallelujah and brother Bram said
[1:10:09] that's the Greater
[1:10:10] Works why would he say that because by
[1:10:16] experience in
[1:10:18] 1959 under the the power of the third
[1:10:22] pool he imp Ed eternal life you
[1:10:26] understand what I'm saying he said I
[1:10:29] give you your two boys in the name of
[1:10:32] Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ brother bam said their names were
[1:10:36] written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:39] Life before the foundation of the
[1:10:42] world and right there their names were
[1:10:46] called amen amen glory to God
[1:10:50] GL because of experience
[1:10:55] he's seen that scripture
[1:10:57] different and that's why many
[1:10:59] times the spirit comes across the
[1:11:03] pulpit amen
[1:11:06] exhorting and and
[1:11:08] rebuking because brother this is not
[1:11:11] only
[1:11:12] something that we could hear the
[1:11:15] word say oh yes I like
[1:11:18] that and this is good and that's all
[1:11:22] right I already heard that but but this
[1:11:25] one's better yes I like that
[1:11:28] one but it's more than
[1:11:31] that hallelujah what we hear the
[1:11:35] Revelation that's been
[1:11:37] preached this message that we hear on
[1:11:41] tape this message that we read in
[1:11:44] books is more than
[1:11:47] that amen amen we should know it by
[1:11:52] experience
[1:11:55] and then it will mean more to
[1:11:58] us because God interprets his
[1:12:03] word by bringing it to
[1:12:06] pass that's the interpretation of
[1:12:10] it amen amen that's how you know that's
[1:12:14] the true
[1:12:17] interpretation so then after
[1:12:20] that amen amen it was until
[1:12:25] 64 that brother ban him for the first
[1:12:28] time I read the quote this morning from
[1:12:31] the message shalom shalom did I read the
[1:12:34] quote this morning where where he quoted
[1:12:36] Greater
[1:12:38] Works St John
[1:12:40] 1412 and he never corrected the
[1:12:43] greater he never said it was more it
[1:12:45] wasn't greater it was
[1:12:49] more no he left it as
[1:12:52] greater and then because of
[1:12:55] experience and because of
[1:12:58] Revelation amen he said the greater is
[1:13:04] this that
[1:13:07] creation was spoken it wasn't
[1:13:12] multiplication like Jesus that had water
[1:13:16] and made it into
[1:13:18] wine had some fish and some
[1:13:21] bread amen amen that was that was in a
[1:13:24] boy's
[1:13:26] lunch right amen amen and with that he
[1:13:30] multiplied and fed
[1:13:33] 5,000 and
[1:13:34] still they picked up 12 baskets
[1:13:40] full is that
[1:13:43] right when they seen that brother they
[1:13:45] begin to follow his
[1:13:48] ministry we want free fish and
[1:13:52] bread
[1:13:55] amen amen but then he turned around and
[1:13:57] told him you follow me because of the
[1:13:59] fish and
[1:14:01] brave and they said well show us a
[1:14:04] sign you say you're greater than
[1:14:07] Moses and Moses in the
[1:14:10] wilderness gave our father's
[1:14:13] bread Mana from Heaven came down you
[1:14:17] show us something greater than
[1:14:19] that he said I am the bread of life
[1:14:24] Hallelujah and I have come down from
[1:14:26] heaven if you eat of me you shall never
[1:14:31] die hallelujah hallelujah said your
[1:14:33] fathers
[1:14:35] ate and every one of them are
[1:14:37] dead he turally
[1:14:40] separated amen amen you see people they
[1:14:44] they think that greater Miracle greater
[1:14:49] sign is
[1:14:51] literal but really brother
[1:14:54] the greatest things in
[1:14:56] God is the
[1:14:58] spiritual and the
[1:15:02] supernatural when you
[1:15:04] see then that that
[1:15:08] scripture to brother Brandon became more
[1:15:12] clear and what it really was it was a
[1:15:17] revelation because that
[1:15:20] scripture being
[1:15:21] revealed light shining upon it then it
[1:15:25] becoming flesh in his own
[1:15:28] testimony and his own
[1:15:30] experience hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:15:33] then it becomes
[1:15:34] life you understand and that's how not
[1:15:38] only that scripture but all
[1:15:42] scriptures amen the prophet of
[1:15:45] God seen how how it become more clear
[1:15:50] every
[1:15:52] time you understand say
[1:15:56] Amen so we find
[1:16:00] here this scripture that we read in St
[1:16:04] John
[1:16:06] 5 I was on my way this morning to read
[1:16:09] some of these
[1:16:12] quotes the devil's uh messing with my
[1:16:16] tablets
[1:16:21] or since I got
[1:16:23] Microsoft Word on my phone I just pull
[1:16:25] it up
[1:16:28] here and here I have the same
[1:16:31] quotes Hallelujah stored amen
[1:16:35] am
[1:16:37] watch what the prophet says in the
[1:16:40] message there's a man here that can turn
[1:16:42] on the
[1:16:45] light
[1:16:48] first he he showed us like we seen this
[1:16:52] morning that that seed laying dormant
[1:16:55] when the light shines upon
[1:16:59] it it comes to
[1:17:01] life and then and then he told us in the
[1:17:04] in the Shalom
[1:17:05] message shom that that third pool was
[1:17:08] going to lay
[1:17:10] dormant but in the time of the
[1:17:13] persecution in the time of the
[1:17:16] squeeze amen he said don't worry little
[1:17:20] sister there's a man in here can turn on
[1:17:23] the
[1:17:24] light during that time you
[1:17:28] understand see that's that to me that's
[1:17:31] clear to to me that that that makes it
[1:17:35] clear
[1:17:37] amen that what he is
[1:17:39] saying is that that third
[1:17:42] pool amen won't be
[1:17:44] used you could want
[1:17:47] iten you can cry for it you can jump up
[1:17:50] and down and Shake all around and run
[1:17:52] and do everything you
[1:17:55] want but it's got to be in the
[1:17:58] season it's got to be at the
[1:18:01] time amen amen and until then amen that
[1:18:06] light can't illuminate the thing
[1:18:10] fully but in the time then it opens up
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:16] part and then that is
[1:18:19] available for the believer because
[1:18:22] brother
[1:18:23] said when that church comes to
[1:18:26] adoption he said she will speak and it
[1:18:30] will create
[1:18:32] itself he said but it won't last
[1:18:34] long it'll be very short and the mouths
[1:18:38] of the
[1:18:39] critics will be
[1:18:42] shut amen hallelujah hear ye him that's
[1:18:46] a
[1:18:47] prophecy saying that the bride coming to
[1:18:50] adoption will speak and it'll
[1:18:55] create but brother it's got to be in the
[1:19:00] season see Hallelujah I remember back
[1:19:03] when we begin to preach those things
[1:19:05] here in the
[1:19:08] church when those things be first begin
[1:19:10] to open
[1:19:12] up amen there was Brothers you know

[1:20:34] controlled by a
[1:20:37] law is that right it's got to be

[1:20:45] is Faith Revelation where does
[1:20:48] revelation come
[1:20:50] from from the word
[1:20:53] so it's got to be according to the

[1:35:59] just under some emotion or some
[1:36:04] influence he was under the scriptural
[1:36:09] light because Jesus said he that does
[1:36:13] not speak are you hear me Jesus said
[1:36:17] this he that does not speak according to
[1:36:21] the law and the
[1:36:24] prophets what did Jesus say has no life

[1:37:13] what he wants but if it's not according
[1:37:16] to the
[1:37:17] word that's not light
[1:37:20] friends that's artificial
[1:37:23] light and brother Bram said the greatest
[1:37:29] robbery
[1:37:30] Robo that ever existed was made in
[1:37:35] England amen a train
[1:37:38] robbery is that righten the prophet say
[1:37:41] that it was done by a false
[1:37:44] light and he said the greatest
[1:37:46] robbery that the devil has done to the
[1:37:49] church is Rob
[1:37:51] them with false light why would you want
[1:37:55] false light if you can have real
[1:38:00] light and the devil's a thief and a
[1:38:05] robber you
[1:38:07] understand see it's got to be according
[1:38:09] to the word

[1:38:26] by the prophet
[1:38:28] Joel amen hallelujah that's
[1:38:32] light when the Holy Ghost fell he
[1:38:35] says was the light upon the word and the
[1:38:40] Word was made

[1:38:44] light he is the light he is the light
[1:38:47] that we should
[1:38:49] follow he is the only light
[1:38:52] the Angels found
[1:38:53] light and followed it to
[1:38:56] him in all ages God has set forth so
[1:39:01] much of his
[1:39:02] word for that particular
[1:39:05] age and God always send
[1:39:08] somebody that that word can get
[1:39:11] into and show the
[1:39:14] light that every age it does the same it

[1:44:32] experience the bride must be
[1:44:35] identified with him amen amen in that
[1:44:39] same
[1:44:40] manner now watch this the prophet goes
[1:44:44] on to

[1:44:51] bride will make her one with the
[1:44:56] word see Hallelujah she must be
[1:44:59] identified with
[1:45:01] him we are
[1:45:03] invited to be Children of the light that

[1:46:02] sickness nor things above nor things
[1:46:05] below no

[1:46:15] that is in
[1:46:16] Christ hallelujah
[1:46:19] hallelujah and that is the
[1:46:22] Capstone the

[1:48:30] this getting
[1:48:33] brighter and
[1:48:34] brighter why is the light getting

[1:49:37] Darkness to get together
[1:49:42] too amen darkness is also
[1:49:46] Gathering let's say that this whole room
[1:49:50] room here was totally pitch black and
[1:49:55] dark
[1:49:56] amen and the little
[1:49:59] light begins to shine back here in the

[1:52:48] dark
[1:52:51] look like they're going to force
[1:52:54] us

[1:53:09] now you've got to come in or they're
[1:53:12] going to close you

[1:53:40] you can't even buy or
[1:53:42] sell that's it you Daron to pray for the
[1:53:47] sick if you're caught ministering
[1:53:51] to any sick or any
[1:53:53] person with any spiritual thing in there

[1:54:47] Christ now the word yes sir vindicates
[1:54:51] the word and
[1:54:54] shows that that is the light of the
[1:54:57] hour that's how we know that it is light
[1:55:02] because the light becomes
[1:55:06] flesh and these people that cannot
[1:55:10] identify the
[1:55:13] light they go into
[1:55:15] darkness they are they are good people
[1:55:19] not bad people they're good people but
[1:55:22] they are
[1:55:24] mistaken just like Joseph and
[1:55:27] Mary very fine people but real
[1:55:31] mistaken what was it God used a
[1:55:34] 12-year-old
[1:55:36] boy to show that the word has to stay
[1:55:41] pure exactly what it was what it said
[1:55:45] the first place it was a virgin Joseph
[1:55:49] was not not his
[1:55:51] father and thinking that he was with
[1:55:55] them when they joined the
[1:55:58] churches and so forth it wasn't so but
[1:56:02] to the
[1:56:04] elect it's different see those others
[1:56:07] are in
[1:56:08] darkness I could stay on that for
[1:56:11] another
[1:56:12] hour but to the
[1:56:14] elect something precious is taking place
[1:56:19] to them that are
[1:56:20] called saints of God I say to you I say
[1:56:25] to the elect to the elect
[1:56:28] lady shalom shalom good
[1:56:32] morning God's
[1:56:34] peace the hour is here if I could had
[1:56:39] been back
[1:56:40] there in the days when the world was
[1:56:43] created and if I could have looked down
[1:56:46] the whole thing and
[1:56:48] seen
[1:56:50] and the father would have said to
[1:56:52] me what day do you want to
[1:56:54] live I would have said right now this is
[1:56:59] the greatest
[1:57:01] hour that the church has ever moved
[1:57:04] into just before the coming of the
[1:57:09] bridegroom oh the real Church listen oh
[1:57:14] the real
[1:57:16] Church of the Living God

[1:57:38] listen being
[1:57:40] Vindicated among
[1:57:46] them hello being
[1:57:50] at among
[1:57:53] them
[1:57:55] hallelujah hallelujah what is the light
[1:57:59] it's the
[1:58:00] Vindication of the spoken
[1:58:03] word something that has already been
[1:58:06] spoken when light shines upon it it
[1:58:10] becomes flesh it becomes
[1:58:13] manifest it's the
[1:58:16] Vindication that is the light
[1:58:20] Hallelujah that's why we said this
[1:58:22] morning you can have the spoken word and
[1:58:26] still not have
[1:58:28] light
[1:58:30] Hallelujah yes
[1:58:32] sir although that's what gives you light
[1:58:37] but brother and sister if you're
[1:58:39] catching what the spirit is telling us
[1:58:42] you understand what I'm
[1:58:44] saying amen you can have the spoken word
[1:58:48] and not have life
[1:58:50] because the light is the
[1:58:53] Vindication of the spoken word it's the
[1:58:58] manifestation of that spoken word that
[1:59:02] word that was
[1:59:03] spoken brought to
[1:59:05] pass let there be light and it is light
[1:59:10] and that is the
[1:59:12] interpretation that is the
[1:59:15] Vindication that is the
[1:59:17] manifestation Hallelujah
[1:59:19] Hallelujah let everybody interpret what
[1:59:22] they want
[1:59:23] brother it's time to stop
[1:59:26] interpreting and start
[1:59:30] manifesting amen no no I don't believe
[1:59:34] that I believe it means
[1:59:37] this amen amen then what you believe it
[1:59:42] is will have to be made
[1:59:46] manifest
[1:59:48] amen if not it's a false
[1:59:52] light and there's a robbery a big one
[1:59:54] taking
[1:59:57] place with false
[2:00:00] light amen amen he
[2:00:03] says this is the
[2:00:05] light Rise and
[2:00:07] Shine for that light has come the light
[2:00:11] of this day Isaiah was the light of his
[2:00:15] day Noah was the light of his day he had
[2:00:19] the word
[2:00:20] manifested the Bible words for this
[2:00:24] day is the light of the day what a
[2:00:27] glorious time that we're
[2:00:29] living good morning means
[2:00:33] peace darkness is gathering what's it
[2:00:37] gathering for to show the light rise and
[2:00:42] shine Isaiah 6 verse one the light has
[2:00:47] come to you that's that's the reason
[2:00:49] that I can say
[2:00:50] shalom the light has
[2:00:53] come God's peace to the elect
[2:00:57] woman to the elected
[2:01:00] lady those who God before the foundation
[2:01:04] of the
[2:01:05] world called and
[2:01:07] ordained the rest of them will never see
[2:01:12] it they'll never know nothing about it
[2:01:16] Jesus said no one will come to me except
[2:01:18] my father draws him
[2:01:21] first there stood
[2:01:23] Judas and the light shining up
[2:01:26] here back in his
[2:01:29] heart was
[2:01:31] darkness and there was a dark
[2:01:33] seed and when The Showdown
[2:01:36] come Darkness showed
[2:01:39] itself but that little woman awful of
[2:01:43] sin and
[2:01:45] Blackness but there was a predestinated
[2:01:48] seed D down in her soul and when that
[2:01:52] light come it scattered the
[2:01:55] darkness and she said we know that when
[2:01:58] Messiah comes he will do these things
[2:02:02] Jesus said I am he hallelujah hallelujah
[2:02:06] but Judas doubted
[2:02:09] it yet list he walked in the
[2:02:14] light for a
[2:02:17] season amen see the spirit is still
[2:02:23] continuing from this morning what we
[2:02:26] read Isaiah 9 them that walk in
[2:02:31] darkness will be brought out of the
[2:02:33] prison
[2:02:34] house house of Hell give way to the name
[2:02:38] of Jesus
[2:02:39] Christ Light has shine and those that
[2:02:43] walked in
[2:02:44] darkness they come out but Matthew 4
[2:02:49] those that sat in
[2:02:51] darkness sat in
[2:02:54] darkness he began to preach
[2:02:57] repentance and later on we find out they
[2:03:00] repented
[2:03:02] not therefore he said you have exalted
[2:03:05] yourself to up to heaven you shall be
[2:03:08] brought down to
[2:03:10] Heaven amen
[2:03:12] amen is that the word
[2:03:15] hallelujah now watch here he said said
[2:03:19] up here's a
[2:03:21] light here it doesn't matter it's the
[2:03:24] light down here that
[2:03:27] counts the light up here listen the
[2:03:31] light up here like
[2:03:33] Judas it will
[2:03:38] walk with the
[2:03:41] light and
[2:03:45] fellowship with the light I'm quoting
[2:03:48] the prophet
[2:03:50] and everything
[2:03:52] else see it can walk with the
[2:03:56] light did Judas walk with the
[2:03:59] light was he a part of the
[2:04:02] ministry Hallelujah he walked with the
[2:04:05] light he he was part of the ministry of
[2:04:08] the
[2:04:09] light amen he fellowship with the
[2:04:16] light he was from the church
[2:04:20] of the
[2:04:22] light
[2:04:25] amen but when the real power of God
[2:04:28] comes
[2:04:30] in it can't come back to the dead
[2:04:40] seed it'll reflect
[2:04:42] off in a
[2:04:46] denomination but when it's back down
[2:04:48] here
[2:04:51] a genuine predestinated
[2:04:54] seed when that light comes down in
[2:04:59] here it shows all the darkness
[2:05:03] away from you and puts you in
[2:05:08] fellowship with
[2:05:10] Christ he was the
[2:05:12] one who gave you life before the
[2:05:16] foundation of the
[2:05:17] world
[2:05:19] wise you'll never see it that's what God
[2:05:24] said so that's why I say to the
[2:05:28] predestinated
[2:05:30] seed shalom shalom rise and
[2:05:35] shine light has sprung
[2:05:39] up hallelujah hallelujah light has come
[2:05:43] thy light has
[2:05:45] come the glory of the Lord has risen
[2:05:48] upon
[2:05:50] me
[2:05:51] because we're near the end
[2:05:55] now he is giving the
[2:05:58] light this light of another
[2:06:02] day listen to
[2:06:04] this amen God is light is that right
[2:06:10] amen the word the light Vindicated
[2:06:14] again so that you can
[2:06:17] see
[2:06:19] manifestations of the promise of God for
[2:06:23] this day search the
[2:06:25] scriptures John 5 for in them you think
[2:06:28] you have eternal
[2:06:30] life and they are they that
[2:06:34] testify of the day that we're living in
[2:06:38] what is the light of the day what is the
[2:06:41] light of the day what the Bible
[2:06:44] promised for this day made manifest
[2:06:49] that's the
[2:06:50] light no wonder Jesus rebuked them for
[2:06:55] not believing
[2:06:57] John Hallelujah he was the
[2:07:00] light because the prophet said he would
[2:07:05] come and there he was the manifested
[2:07:10] light they didn't see
[2:07:12] it when he
[2:07:14] come they didn't understand it they
[2:07:18] thought he was the
[2:07:20] Messiah amen did they did they think
[2:07:23] John the Baptist was the
[2:07:25] Messiah they couldn't
[2:07:28] identify what the light was he was the
[2:07:32] light of the
[2:07:34] Prophecies of Isaiah but not even the
[2:07:38] disciples were able to see
[2:07:41] that amen they were still
[2:07:46] influenced by what the scribes said
[2:07:50] amen amen they still had the
[2:07:53] influence of the different
[2:07:57] fellowships and the different
[2:07:59] churches that they used to go
[2:08:03] to amen amen hallelujah although they
[2:08:07] were already following
[2:08:09] Christ although they were they were with
[2:08:12] his
[2:08:13] ministry they said but the scribes
[2:08:17] say
[2:08:19] that
[2:08:20] Elias brother bam says that even the
[2:08:23] disciples missed
[2:08:27] it they missed the
[2:08:29] light when they were
[2:08:32] shining amen what do we read right here
[2:08:35] St John
[2:08:37] 5 that
[2:08:39] John was a burning and Shining
[2:08:45] Light and they were willing to rejoice
[2:08:49] in that light but not really
[2:08:53] understanding what the thing
[2:08:56] was watch here he
[2:09:00] says Jesus rebuked
[2:09:03] them for not believing John he was the
[2:09:07] light because the prophet said he would
[2:09:10] come and there he was the manifested
[2:09:13] light they didn't see it they didn't
[2:09:17] understand it they thought he was the
[2:09:20] Messiah they thought something else and
[2:09:23] this and the other they failed to see it
[2:09:27] and Jesus come
[2:09:28] on and said two lights can't shine at
[2:09:33] the same
[2:09:37] time Hallelujah there listen there can't
[2:09:42] be Church
[2:09:44] light and God
[2:09:47] light at at the same
[2:09:50] time it's got to be God's
[2:09:53] light putting out the church
[2:09:57] light and that's
[2:09:59] exactly what is taking
[2:10:02] place
[2:10:07] today amen the whole time he's talking
[2:10:11] about a new day a Breaking of a new day
[2:10:16] oh brother I'm not going to have time to
[2:10:18] finish this
[2:10:19] tonight because we got to go back to
[2:10:21] Genesis
[2:10:23] 1 amen amen and we got to see how God
[2:10:27] sees a
[2:10:28] day not how we see a day not how Pagan
[2:10:34] tradition has taught us what a day
[2:10:38] is we say a day begins in the
[2:10:42] morning and ends at night not
[2:10:47] God you know that's the
[2:10:51] Bible you know that the Bible says and
[2:10:54] the
[2:10:56] evening and the
[2:10:58] morning was the first day read that in
[2:11:01] the
[2:11:03] Bible and the evening and the morning
[2:11:07] was the second
[2:11:10] day and the evening and the morning was
[2:11:15] the third
[2:11:16] day go back to Genesis 1 and see how God
[2:11:21] sees a
[2:11:22] day that's why there's a lot of
[2:11:25] confusion in the
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:28] message that's why there's no
[2:11:31] understanding of what we're coming into
[2:11:33] in this
[2:11:34] hour amen amen because this light begins
[2:11:39] in the
[2:11:41] evening amen amen in the
[2:11:44] evening there shall be light and then he
[2:11:47] said
[2:11:49] to the bride good
[2:11:52] morning
[2:11:54] Hallelujah he doesn't say good

[2:13:05] that Genesis
[2:13:10] 131 God saw everything that was he made
[2:13:13] and behold it was very good and the
[2:13:16] evening and the morning
