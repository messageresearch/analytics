your Bibles with me amen blessed be the name of the Lord The Book of Numbers chapter 15. amen we'll be taking our texts here this morning our title this morning is the revelation of the Blue Ribbon amen the revelation of the Blue Ribbon everybody hear me okay amen thank you Numbers Chapter 15. amen we're going to begin reading here at the 21st 25th verse be reading a couple of scriptures and then we'll drop down to the 37th verse to get our texts amen Numbers Chapter 15. verse 25. and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord and their sin offering before the Lord for their ignorance and that shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance and if any sow sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly when he's sinneth by ignorance before the Lord to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him you shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for this stranger that sojourneth among them but the soul that does ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproaches the Lord that Soul shall be cut off from among his people because he have despised the word of the Lord and have broken his Commandment that show that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon Him amen verse 37 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel ambid them that they should make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their Generations that they put upon The Fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the Commandments of the Lord and do them and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to go ahori that you may remember and do all my Commandments amen see this Blue Ribbon amen is to remind them of all of the word of God Amen is is to remind him of all the commands see not just some of them but all of them amen then he says that you may remember and do all my Commandments and be holy unto your God I am the Lord your God see look who he's speaking to here amen which brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God I am the Lord dear God Amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord God we deemed us a great privilege father this morning to be in your presence oh God to come father and worship you in spirit and in truth O Lord we come father with a desire Lord and an expectation in our hearts this morning and that is to see you come on the scene O Father and Quicken your word to us oh God that it would encourage your children father Lord that it would bless him oh God Lord that he would give him overcoming power in this dark and hard time that we're living Father for I believe oh God that we're fighting a real battle Lord God is not against flesh and blood as you've told us in your word but oh God it's against powers and principalities oh God where your prophets said that all hell's been let loose oh God and 200 million demons are let loose against the bride under the seventh seal Lord oh Father it's a it's it's a hard time but we are more than conquered as Hallelujah you have given us the victory o God you ever given us father power you've given us your word in This Hour the full armor of God lord to take forward against Lord the the armies of the enemy and you said father when the enemy would come in like a flood that you would raise up a standard against it Lord and we believe Lord this message this word of the hour to be the standard that we are to lift up oh God and we ask so God that you would come and help me this morning Father may you may you help me Father anoint me oh God to speak your word to your children and may you anoint to hear also Father as we come together Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen if I could get he may be seen if I could just a little more volume up here on the monitor is that okay man I'm trying to try and watch my voice hear how to do infection and we've been struggling a little with that but amen we're trusting in Him to help us amen now the revelation of the Blue Ribbon amen I don't know you know of I don't I don't want to be too long and you all wore out and we don't know what God might do this evening amen but uh we'll just go as as the Lord would lead us amen because this is a pretty extensive thing we have here by God's grace we just want to bring it out to you may it be a help here in the Book of Numbers chapter 15 amen as we see that God is speaking to The Exodus people he is speaking to those who have been called out by the message of a prophet amen he's not speaking to the Nations or the other kingdoms or the other people of other of other of other nations amen he is speaking to in a called out people you're speaking to somebody amen that is seeing the Vindication of God for their hour that the Deliverance of God had come and he'd promised what he told Abraham that they would be delivered amen after 400 years and what what the mighty and strong powerful arm amen and the arm of the Lord would be revealed in that hour amen the strength of power of the Lord to deliver them and bring them out amen and this is the people that he's talking to amen and I believe that we are that people in this hour we are the people that's been called out amen by this message we are the people that has received a Vindicated prophet of God Amen that came with thus saith the Lord to tell these denominations let them go amen just like he told Pharaoh let my people go amen we receive a message in this hour and a prophet amen with the same signs of Moses and if you notice Amen in the time of Deliverance he was speaking things into existence Hallelujah he was he was bringing the word of God but in order for this uh Deliverance to come amen there was the power of the spoken word and I believe that's what sets us free in this hour amen that power the spoken word amen and we've seen in our day that he could take he could create something out of nothing amen and this is who he's speaking to here in the scripture this is who he's he's speaking to in here in numbers 15. but if you notice something you know God had a hard time with the children of Israel is that right senator he he had a real hard time amen because you know they they they murmured they complain they saw the works of God they saw the power of God they seen what God could do for them amen and that God had promised not just to bring them out but to take him in amen because Redemption as brother Madam said is in two parts amen he has brought us out of Darkness to bring us into his marvelous life amen that's what he's bringing us into in this hour that's where we that's where we are amen amen but notice here he he's giving the people laws amen this is after the fact that God had come down upon a mountain if you're with me this morning he had already come down upon a mountain in a thick Cloud amen laughs amen and Moses was the only one that was caught up into that cloud Hallelujah favorite and he received something in that cloud amen and he came back down from the cloud amen Hallelujah and he said this is The Testament Hallelujah Oh Glory to God and then there was shedding of blood and all these things amen for the tester but notice those things had had taken place already and yet the people of God God is seeing something in the people he is seeing that there's some that sin ignorantly you're seeing that others sin presumptuously or willfully amen but now notice he's he's going to make a provision for them he's gonna he's gonna show him Grace during the time that he's given law and judgment because you know brother Madam said when God came down in Exodus 19. in that cloud he said that was judgment amen because God has showed them grace and grace had brought them out Grace said send them a prophet the pillar of fire amen what's leading them but yet they chose law brother bam said and here in Exodus 19 amen when brother Madden preaches Revelations 4 he preaches a throne of mercy and of judgment and he takes it back to Exodus 19 to show us what happened in our day and in our hour we're not talking about a historical God this morning we're talking about the great idea we're talking about what all these scriptures all these Prophecies of the Bible brother Adam said they all became new when the shields were open you believe that you believe this Bible is a new Bible amen this Bible has become new Hallelujah now it's not history anymore it's not just stories anymore it's not just some little children's story amen it's prophecy being fulfilled in our hour that was foretelling something amen every scripture of the Bible and that's what we see here that this was a prophecy this was something to show us that in the time that God has come down in judgment amen he's gonna he shows Grace into his people now think about this there's two sins that he that that he's speaking of here and in numbers 15 you can read if if you want to study it from about verse 22 he's bringing the Commandments to the priests and to the people concerning their sins done in ignorance and sins made by presuming amen no brother Madam said to presume is to venture without actual Authority or he said this is what he also said about pursuing he said or it's to take it for granted see they had taken it for granted and that's what happens sometimes with us amen we take it for granted that God sent us the most powerful message amen we take it for granted that God Vindicated with the pillar of fire Hallelujah we take it for granted but God is still showing grace to the people amen this is amazing because brother Adam said this is an hour many are presuming many presume in their ways they presume he said ministers preach Doctrine amen of their denomination presuming and the message presumably 1962 that they're doing exactly what's right many of them no matter how contrary it is to the scripture they presume they're doing right when they preach that Doctrine see they think it's right but whether it be right or not they're pursuing that is just what God requires a certain Creed or a certain affiliation you get me they think that's all that just God requires they presume that they're taking people to Heaven by just joining Church and preaching the Creed see they're presuming and that's what is being done that's all you have to do but what a mistake that is it's a terrible mistake of presuming see and then God said those who sin that way they'll be cut off from among the people amen is that we read here in the scripture but now notice he said for those who sin ignorantly amen there'll be an atonement for them there'll be a sacrifice for the you believe that you believe there's still Grace amen you believe God is still amen interceding for his children and we could call upon the name of the Lord when we make a mistake many we we all make mistakes we all do things sometimes ignorantly and sometimes presumptuously is that right but yet God shows Grace to us hallelujah something to hold us something to keep us Amen brother Madam said this is a time where Christians and many people in churches and ministers don't know where they stand they're all wishy-washy amen he said there's no more Backbone in Christianity that's just jellyfish amen one day their bride next day their foolish virgin and next day they're just Chad and father you know is that right there's no stableness brother Adam said amen we gotta put these stabilizers on the on the ship of Zion amen Hallelujah stabilize ourselves in the word of God Amen amen this is what God has brought us amen a blue ribbon Amen to show us Grace because I can't do it brother amen and God seeing God see that his people weren't going to be able to fulfill this there was no one ever able to fulfill the law is that right he knew he is seeing their their vulnerable amen he knows these things he knows our challenges he knows what we're facing amen he knows what what time we're living in this is the most evil and darkest time there's ever existed and the children of Israel they they weren't facing things we're facing today Brother David is that right no no now it's multiplied sin and filth of this modern world how much more do we need a blue ribbon in this hour to look to amen to look to so that it would remind us now get that there get that there to remind us of the word of God to remind us amen that you're a child of the king to remind us that you've got to walk Amen in Victory and not in defeat amen how much more do we need this in the south see but you know what this is a time that brother Branham said there will be no excuses at the day of judgment you believe that God ain't going to leave no one in ignorance he ain't going to leave no one in ignorance and if they're ignorant brother Adam said they're well fully ignorant he said it's like a man in a basement remember that refusing to believe that there's sunlight amen oh we got so many of that today I'm not talking about natural sunlight but they refuse to believe that the son of man is revealed in this day and that's the evening light of this hour they refuse they locked themselves up in a basement and they said I don't believe that I stay in this Darkness but I of the rising of the sun I don't want to know nothing about that you understand but they are willfully ignorant brother but I've said something's wrong with that person in his in his mind let's turn to acts 17 30. God ain't gonna leave no one in ignorance this is the hour brother worth the full word of God is revealed and everyone somehow some way brother Madam said even at the day of judgment he said there'll be some there that they seen they probably they probably never was presented or something like that he said but they've seen the life of somebody remember brother I'm saying that it's at the day of judgment they'll be judged because they at one time or another seen a child of God at one time one another he said they've seen the life of Christ and somebody and they knew that tested that was you're a written epistle rid of all men is that right so no one had to had to give him a message book or a Bible for them to read they read you they read your life is that right Hallelujah brother Adam said in this day that we're living He said people don't read their Bible no more so what does he do he says he puts the word in me in you it makes you the walking Bible amen written a pistols read of all men he's to write these things in our hearts on the tables of our heart amen acts 17 30 says and the times of this ignorance God winked at that means he overlooked but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent so at one time God was okay with people being in ignorant but now it's judgment time brother Adam said you believe that you believe that cloud in 63 was showing a supreme judge amen but yet in the hour of law in the hour of judgment amen he shows mercy and Grace unto the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Adam said this sinful world is ripe for judgment they're right for judgment there'll be no excuses man no excuses know that I didn't know I wasn't there God ain't gonna leave no one in ignorance but yet he shows Grace he shows this revelation of the Blue Ribbon to us amen might be a little strange title but you'll get it in the future amen don't worry I break you know funny things here just it's the word of God Amen see he ain't going to leave no one in ignorance see at one time God overlooked our ignorance but now now that Elijah has come Hallelujah now that the son of man Ministry has come amen it has been shown to Every Nation the mighty Angels come down with an open book the white wig shows that this world is right for judgment amen brother badham said that the lamb that John seen in Revelations 5 he said he had not seen this land before he had been way in the eternities interceding for our ignorance is that what he said he had been interceding for our ignorance but at the end of the ages the book had to be opened is that right so the intercession for ignorance is over see and now God brother bam said he's claiming his children this is a claiming hour remember when he spoke of Ruth Ruth deciding amen Ruth laboring Ruth resting and then afterward he said Boaz did the claiming work he said this is that Ally when the open of the seals come he comes to claim the names that were on the book so now notice because the Seven Ages brother Bantam said he was the son of God he was priests he was intercessory is that right but now he's Advocate I want to get into that he's our Advocate do we have an advocate with the father amen see but intercession for ignorance is over now he comes to claim brother Brown said in the breach between the ages and the seals 1963. he says here notice he raised there today as as intercessor and to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people but John had not seen him he had been making intercession he had been way back in the eternities see showing that this substitutionary offering causing to believe it point it to him and the blood had not been shed yet and now the Bible says in Hebrews 12 that we have been brought amen not into a natural Mountain but unto amen Mount Zion and to the congregation of the firstborn into a numerable company of angels is that right that he says that where these numerable company of angels dwell also where God the judge of all is see the evening light has come you believe that the son of man has been revealed but when people are not willing see to seek after the truth they won't find it but Jesus said blessed are they who do thirst and hunger after righteousness they shall be filled now let us let us notice verse 29 there are numbers and numbers 15 verse 29 . you shall have one law for him that senteth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of Israel that for the stranger that sojourners among them brother random said that Eve she didn't sin willfully is that right she was deceived into it she thought she was doing right when she did amen but Adam's sin he was through through one man sin came into the world Amen but Adam walked out willfully he fell in transgression he sinned see but here the Lord sees that Israel was is so vulnerable and knew that they weren't able to fulfill his law he sees our weaknesses he sees our faults he sees how we all fall short of the glory of God so he provides Grace for them by the Blue Ribbon amen God sees our our inability Amen to stay to stay in the word but that's why I really random said the Holy Ghost amen he said that quickening power amen the spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body it'll subject you to the word that's the Blue Ribbon amen it's the spirit of Truth it's the Holy Ghost it's a token of the hour amen it subjects you to the word is that right brings this body into subjection Amen brother Adam said this is my worst enemy amen this is the one that gets in God's way this is the one amen but that that blue ribbon that Holy Ghost on the inside amen brother about them said it and you will never get it if your soul didn't come from God he said if your soul came from God you always had eternal life that chain of God what's inside of you amen from the very time you came to the Earth but it's just now coming to life amen it's just now the Pearl amen is being brought out of the mud glory to God amen is being polished Amen brother damn said he got to beat the gold he's got to put it through the fire amen and sometimes we wonder Lord why are you putting me through this Lord why is this happening why is there problems in the church why is there problems in my family why is there problems in me why is there problems at home Hallelujah but don't worry even if you do fall amen God is giving you a blue ribbon to look not with natural eyes not with natural ice but we see with our heart we understand something on the inside we have a revelation to see to see is to understand amen and over there they had to see naturally look at the blue rib and say okay yeah that that reminds me of all the word of God I gotta I gotta get you know you know what you know what they say about this blue ribbon some commentaries they say the the this blue ribbon of course blue is a Heavenly color amen and it was used upon the borders of the priest's garments and they're signified that the Servants of God were to be Heavenly minded they were to be in obedience Heavenly in obedience and character separated from Earthly Ambitions and desires that's what that was for that's what that blue Rhythm was for to separate them from Earthly Ambitions and desires and you know in the natural of any in any contest you know what the Blue Ribbon is right that's the first first place Hallelujah amen you got to put his kingdom first amen you got to put the Blue Ribbon first that's his place amen and all other things shall come all the things shall be added unto you amen not not red ribbon not you know white ribbon uh Blue Ribbon first place amen it must be present within us amen see that's what that was for to remind them so but now now it's in the spiritual Realm see we don't we don't have to have you know the role or take a wearing the blue ribbon on them so see right amen but each each and every one of you can see that amen with eyes of understanding was eyes of faith with eyes of Revelation amen it's something in the soul that that's got to keep us in this hour did you know brother Madam said amen that God put in you all that you need for this journey amen you say God I need this it's in you already brother he even said in one message that's what he said you can look it up he said the Rapture it's already in you God am I going to make the Rapture he said it's already in you Hallelujah the cloud amen I need healing it's inside of you brother amen I need help it's there we got to draw from it we got to recognize we got to see amen with eyes of faith that the blue ribbons there amen I noticed so he he sees these things amen but now he's by this he's given them he's giving them some help here see that that was just in the natural that they would look and live amen and when when they looked at it it would remind them of all the Commandments of God see this is the hour where God promised to reveal all of the world is that right you know what I saw a file brother Larry about this blue ribbon this Blue Ribbon is not like we would think you know a ribbon it was actually like we read there at the fringes or at the borders of the hymns of the Garment but what it was is that they were all their threading all their their loose ends are you with me amen all their loose ends this this is you can look this up here all these Loose Ends they had blue Loose Ends but what they would do is that they would tie all the Loose Ends together amen and that's that was actually all the loose ends tied together was the Blue Ribbon oh we're promised in the shower amen according to Revelation 10 7 glory to God that when the spirit of Truth would come he would tie up all the Loose Ends to give us a token amen see what is blue represent and the message Hebrews chapter 6 part 3. 57. he said this great Forerunner has gone before us making a way he become from Spirit the great Fountains of the rainbow of God who had no beginning or no end he was forever God this ray of light went forth it was a ray of love that's the main one red but notice the next color that follows which was blue and blue is the trueness blue is the trueness see the spirit of Truth was going to come Jesus promises is that right if you turn with me two I'm gonna do a little Sunday school this morning Saint John chapter 14 and we'll read verse 16. Saint John chapter 14. let's just read verse 26 amen amen but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will sin in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Saint John now 16th chapter in the 13th verse or 12th verse 16 12. I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now oh my God is that right so so he had a lot of things within him amen that he that he cannot he could not tell them and neither through the seven Church ages there was no way that these things could be given amen but at the at the end time at the open of these Seven Seals amen the full mystery of God would be revealed and it would it would bring a token of the hour brother random said the token amen did not come into existence until after these 14 days amen but now notice he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you into all truth or he shall not speak of himself but whosoever but whosoever he shall whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak amen and he will show you things that come glory to God he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and shall shoe it unto you all that the father have have our mind therefore said I that he shall take a mind and shall shoot unto you amen notice what mother Madam says about this Spirit of Truth now keep this in mind that we're speaking Amen on this on this Blue Ribbon because that's what I believe it is a representation that was a foreshadow of the token of the hour amen something to to be on display in the South something to be applied into our hearts into our lives in the message three Witnesses 1951. he says send your angel from heaven that he might anoint your servant with the spirit of the prophetic being that would show things which was and things to come that I might declare you before the people saying that you're the same yesterday today and forever same Lord who knew where Nathanael was how he prayed under the tree how that woman at the well and had the husbands and the fish the coin in his mouth you're you know all things father amen I saw God's omniscience amen the might of God coming down in the last days pray for that same Spirit to be here tonight in the midst and will help us Amen in the future hope 1964 brother Madam is speaking amen here how that all scripture must be fulfilled he says see you can't die you got eternal life the only thing the Redeemer has made you recognize it and you were always that that's the reason you see the day you're living in how many seasons raise your hand oh that's powerful think about what he said that's the reason you see the day you're living in see thank you the day we're living in you recognize it goes on to say the same message if you are the bride the bride is part of the husband the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of the husband the word you are you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that now you have to recognize your position you have to recognize that God can't do Tuesday's work can't be done on Wednesday and Wednesdays got to be done on Wednesday amen say he said if you'd note Moses you know me the word for the hour the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me see get the idea he says oh my then Jesus said in Saint John 14 when he the Holy Ghost is tough he will bring these things to your memory remember that blue really was to remind them of all the Commandments of God that's what the spirit of Truth is doing in this hour amen he's reminding us and he says when the spirit of Truth was to come it was to bring these things to your memory to show you what day you're living in and then another thing you'll know him by is that he'll show you things to come see it's right back to the prophetic again when he's come see now look at this in the message of God 1962. paragraph 35 he says the holy spirit always speaks of the word you believe that he says I've got so many things he's quoting we read this right now I've got so many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it and look what he says after that's the reason the coming of the seals when was the spirit of Truth to come you say it fell on the day of Pentecost yes it did not denied it it was through the seven churches yes the holy ghost in the church I'm talking about the Blue Ribbon this morning I'm talking about the token Hallelujah amen I'm talking about your day and its message I'm talking about the word for our day amen when that's the reason the coming of the seals marriage and divorce 1965. paragraph 233 he says but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word you hear that now that the shields are open the spirit of Truth directs us see when they would see that ribbon it would direct them amen to the Commandments of God to the word of God to the full revelation of the hour is that right amen but now with eyes of faith of understanding we see that amen and God has increased in Revelation I believe amen that this Revelation must increase it must get higher and higher amen brother Venom said these broken sisters amen they got static water amen they say but this this Fountain amen a pouting open in the House of David amen for sin and uncleanliness he says in Artesian well it flows it bubbles Hallelujah all the time even if it's dark if it's sunny if it's winter if it's summer it bubbles amen Hallelujah that keeps you all the time no matter what's taking place amen you can have a bubble in your soul all the time it don't got to be Sunday amen and if it's Sunday it should be even more Hallelujah Lord of God but Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday amen it's bubbly it's bubbling something on the inside amen Hallelujah though his flesh get sick and tired though the mind is struggling you don't know what to do but something deep down inside it's pushing expression amen now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word ain't that powerful he says that explains why all the mistakes has been done Through the Ages because the seals was not open the Blue Ribbon had not come yet amen remember he said he'll show you things to come he'll show you things that are to be didn't he preach one like that things that are to be Sean use the spirit of Truth and he not only spoke back to Genesis 1 1. he went to the mind of God he'll remind you what is that he'll bring you back to God's memory he'll bring you to the mind of God to the memory of God to the thoughts of God so that you can recognize you were in his mind you were one of those Scots amen but now you've been expressed amen it'll remind you didn't Malachi didn't Malachi 3 said that he was going to write a book of remembrance it's memory of God you believe God has memory you believe God has a memory amen you can testify of this amen preachers can testify this you're preaching the Norton comes you just remember things is that right remember things you remember what is that the period of Truth reminding you I don't know if I'm crazy but sometimes I I even hear Brother Brown's voice in my head that's probably just me I'm just crazy like that I don't know amen but I hear his voice just like just like he screams on the tape that's how I hear it on here amen see brings it to your memory why amen because when these seals open brother Adam said it's calling the names out of the book that's the mystery being revealed the mystery being revealed it's not only revealing the written word but it's revealing the predestinated word yes sir he said in the message it is the rising of the Sun 1965 he said the word predestinated comes to the word written for the hour he said the word to the word that's what he said the word comes to the word the word predestinated to the word written of the hour and there's a United amen that's an invisible Union between Christ and his bride there's something taking place amen see to show you things that are to be it's prophetic is that right look what he said in Christ revealed in his own word paragraph 158. he says what's Malachi 4 to do to do the same thing what was the opening of the seals to do is to reveal and bring out if you haven't got eyes then what's the use to reveal there's got to be Eyes First is that right to reveal Malachi 4. to reveal Saint Luke 17 30 to reveal Saint John 14 12 and also Saint John 15 24 and then he says and Saint John 16 13. isn't that where we read 1613. prayer the truth in Revelation was 10 1-7 see it's to illuminate Paul said it in Ephesians to illuminate the eyes of our understanding you said unless you're born again cannot see the kingdom of God to see is to understand amen Harvest Time 1964 he said but when the spirit of Truth has come he'll bring these things that I have taught to your memory he'll also show you things to come so the real Spirit-filled church now stays with the word and reflects the word it's God on Earth brother bam said deity's not in heaven hey man deity's not in heaven see they criticize us you believe in you know that deity stuff of course I do amen the whole the whole the whole words deity amen you believe this is God imprint for you so it's got to be dead amen this deity see amen but oh my now I believe just like this red Scarlet rope or the line that Rahab had to hang out her window as a sign as a token this has the blood on the doorpost I believe this blue ribbon the type of the token also amen has to be on display but Abraham said each time you come before God In Prayer got to present your token is that right how are you going to ask for something amen how are you going to claim something if you don't believe your names on the claiming book amen but when you believe amen by faith you can come with confidence and boldness Before the Throne of God said Lord I'm not worthy of this but by your grace amen you you've gave me this inheritance and I come to possess it this morning I come to take it amen why because the Blue Ribbon amen is putting me as something that I I know that I know amen Hallelujah that I come from the loins of Elohim that when he told Joe where was you before I lay the foundations of the world amen when the bomb of Gilead comes it begins to cure your Amnesia amen your spiritual Amnesia begins to go away and memory starts to come memory of God the spiritual will remind you amen of these things he said our human minds are they're dark into that amen Jesus he could go back and say glorify me with the glory we had before the foundation of the world he said but our minds are human minds they're dark into that amen but he said these that are possessed with the spirit of God they resisted the devil's lie in the beginning there's something on the inside amen that connects with the revealing of the word and when that connection happens brother ain't nothing that can break your elusia from the tie of the Blue Ribbon this is what we got to do in the shower we gotta hold on to that Hem of His Garment because it's on the fringes of of His Garment amen is he the high priest Hallelujah is he the one that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen but that woman what does she do she knew that was the word for her hour she knew amen that was caught in human flesh walking around there amen and she had an issue amen isn't that amazing we all got issues amen she had a blood issue but I got different issues amen Hallelujah no matter what your issue is amen draw virtue for all virtue amen are we here to draw a virtue this morning amen I need virtue amen you need virtue amen Hallelujah but brother Adam said in order to give out virtue you got to First have virtue amen but it's not your virtue he said the virtue of Jesus Christ it's the patience of Jesus Christ it's the faith of Jesus Christ amen so it's the Holy Ghost Inside of You amen is that right amen notice notice this see you believe the spirit of Truth has come directing us to the word it's keeping us in line with the word see that was Israel's problem amen God saw their inability to stay with the word they were always going one side go another side see but amen when he gives him something to hold on we got to hold on to that what God has given us we can't pursue take it for granted we can't Venture without Authority we got to know what we're doing brother Brown said don't take one step without first knowing what you're doing amen Hallelujah and footsteps are possession we're possessed in this thing amen this is ours Hallelujah God has given it to us by grace you believe every promise in the book is yours every chapter every verse Every Lie amen oh my God so we gotta draw from this word amen God give us a message not only to read it it had knowledge intellectually but to draw virtue from it see to draw a virtue from it let me read something to you is in the message hey we're talking about the Blue Ribbon right how the angel came to me I like brothers I had already printed this quote but I wanted to do it bigger and brother Larry already had the font real big so look how big that came out real big I liked it how the angel came to me in his Commission 1955. he says in the beginning the first thing that I could ever remember is a vision the first thing that I can recall to my mind is a vision that the lord gave me and that was many many years ago I was a little bitty boy and I had a rock in my hand he said now I beg your pardon I can remember what I was wearing a long dress this is the first thing Brother Band can remember now I can hardly remember I was three years old right probably four years old some running can you remember some things maybe a little bit but he remembers when he was crawling you know it's probably before a year old something like that right first thing he can remember is what he was wearing a long dress he says I don't know where the interview old enough to remember when little boys used to wear long dresses how many here remember when children wore yes long dresses he says well I I can remember in my little old Hut there where we lived I was crawling on the floor and it was someone I don't know who it was that come in and Mama had worked a little blue ribbon into my dress mama mama worked a blue ribbon into my dress mama had worked a little blue ribbon into my dress we're talking about the Blue Ribbon this morning you getting me now it's hard to get me now a little bit amen Blue Ribbon the first thing he can remember oh my goodness the first thing he can remember in in his in his mind is a blue ribbon and then it was showing us hallelujah that God had brought to the Earth amen the one that was to bring the revelation of the Blue Ribbon hallelujah amen that from the beginning of his life to the end and of his life that blue ribbon was pressing amen the spirit of Truth had come Amen to do what to bring us this Eagle anointing Amen to draw us into the rapturing grace of the Lord to show us the Blue Ribbon had arrived amen that's God's grace in the shower brother for you God put us in this age God for ordained us to live and this day that we live and he knew Amen in his infinite mind that we in this humanistic realm amen we would fail we would have sinned amen be bored and shaped in iniquity amen but in order even before you and I came I'm gonna provide them this Blue Ribbon Hallelujah Hallelujah so when they come on the scene amen they know the word for their hour it's a blue ribbon to hold on to amen that's what we're here for this morning Hallelujah God has brought us the Blue Ribbon look he even got blue on his tie amen Hallelujah amen he even got a little blue on his tie Blue Ribbon glory to God mama mama worked a blue ribbon in his dress amen Hallelujah who would ever think now remember not only the woman after not only the woman with the blood issue touched Jesus but in Mark chapter 6 The Bible says that many came unto Jesus amen and they just all they wanted to do was touch him amen brother that same thing happened in our day listen to me and under the first and second pool brother Branham you had people just wanting to get just close enough to touch them I can go through quotes I got quotes here but Brother Band tells testimon little girl in Finland he tests testimony of different ones he said the little girl just came didn't say a word said she put her hand on my coat touched it let go looked up at me and walked away Brother Brad I'm saying the Lord showed me a vision said she was completely healed he says I couldn't speak her language he says you you don't you don't understand me said but you're whole and she said Thank you in her language you had people just coming to the meetings just to get into prayer line This is under first and second pool I don't know if anybody here was in the prayer line or something like that maybe but brother that doesn't mean that you and I can't draw a virtue from him now because now by the spirit of Truth the opening of the word of the seals that was done under the third pool you believe that he said that anointing ones at the end time amen the spiritual part amen but notice what is it for what is this forb amen are these things just to debate debate about well I believe it's this way you know it's that way amen I just believe it all right but you see we got to draw a virtue from it that's what this is about amen draw virtue from this we gotta grab a hold amen the Hem of this garment amen and this garment is the word is that right revelation 19. garment's the word but notice that's what we're holding on to see not under the first and second pool but God has brought us to the most glorious part of this not to touch his coat physically amen but to draw virtue from the revealing of the word so what because first poor dealt with Divine Healing that was in the flesh sicknesses and things in the flesh first pool second pool is deserving the spirit second round you tell people you've done this you've done that the third pool Hallelujah glory to God it caused a gene inside of your soul calling your name amen Hallelujah the Mysteries calling your name the revealing of the wire the third pull amen is calling your soul and you're being drawn to this amen and you come to the word amen and you'll begin to draw a virtue being a draw Revelation for your life if it's all wisdom and understanding amen you believe that in the south God has brought us to the most glorious part of this of of this of his ministry amen to draw a virtue from it to pool like that woman amen and touch the hymn of His Garment she had a revelation brother she had a revelation because brother random said it's your attitude towards God's gift he said one Roman soldier spit in his face and socked them amen he didn't get no virtue out of it and that's what they're doing to this Blue Ribbon brother that's what they're doing to this message and that's why they say well I don't get none out of it that's why it's your attitude towards a message it's your attitude towards this word it's your attitude towards this garment it's your attitude towards the Blue Ribbon amen and they begin to say well he missed it here he missed it there you failed here you know but I believe the bride's got absolute in the shot I believe we got a tide post to hold on to amen I believe we got an anchor of the Soul that's beyond the veil amen hallelujah it's in the soul amen that's where it is that right and what happens we come to draw from this and you know that woman with the blood issue she had a revelation all she did was touch him and everybody was pressing them touching them but he says somebody touched I perceive it strength virtue holy ghost power has come out of me to touch somebody's need amen and she she saw she came out she said that wasn't me amen Hallelujah oh my God look at this scripture with me Leviticus 15. what time we have Leviticus 15. verse 25 if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation of it run beyond the time of her separation of the days of the issue of her uncleannessia shall be as the days of her separation she shall be unclean every bed we're on she lieth all the days of her issue shall be in her as the bed of her separation and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean as the uncleanliness of her separation whosoever touches those things that shall be unclean shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be clean until they're even see cleansing our notices cleansing always come in the evening time then he says what if she be cleansed of her issue then shall then she shall number to herself how many days seven days and after that she shall be cleaned see you believe Jesus Christ took care of our issue two thousand years ago but still the church had to count seven days think about it Seven Days Seven Church ages amen now remember the one with the blood shoe she touched some of His Garment she was healed that was a tight the church then amen getting there and cleaning the issue taken care of but seven days and after that she shall be clean and on the eighth day see on the eighth day she shall take unto her two Turtles two young pigeons and bring them into the priests of the door of the Tabernacle the congregation oh my I'm bypassing a whole lot of things here and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make an atonement for before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness see if you study this the Bible actually says that the woman was not even allowed into the congregation she wasn't allowed to approach anybody to touch anybody that's why this woman in order to do that in the days of Jesus she had to have understanding and Faith she wasn't going to go try to see if she was going to get healed she was going to get healed amen she was going to go touch amen and draw a virtue out of it Hallelujah but it was showing us amen that after these seven churches glory to God when the rising of a new day brother random said amen The Eighth Day Hallelujah when he'd turn he starts to blend in with the Son of God Amen this issue would be taken care of why because there would be something here Amen to give us that virtue that overcoming power that's why he said this bride will not fall Hallelujah because we got something all the other ages didn't have Hallelujah amen this ain't going to be a cycle like all the other Cycles mother Madam said they had a cycle remember said it was Revival and then it go down and then to go into formalism and organization and then God would have to raise up another one did you know brother bam said Church ages he said that cycle is ended he said this cycle is going into eternity amen brother this is in the Eighth Day our eyes are being open our issues been taken care of it wasn't your fault to begin with amen you are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Oh Glory to God brother it's taking care of already hey man and now he can enter into God's provided place of worship freely that woman wasn't it was wasn't allowed by the law to enter into the congregation but now by the Blue Ribbon we can come in Hallelujah God provided place of worship because the token has been applied the tokens on the door amen we can come in amen freely so Plunge in this morning Hallelujah you believe it's a only provided place of worship in this hour you know brother bam said that's the message of the hour it's a word for our day it's God's Own provided place you said other everybody claims Jesus amen who doesn't claim Jesus is that right everybody claims Jesus see and if everybody that claims Jesus worshiping their way brother bam said they're worshiping the devil in this hour thinking they're worshiping God but there's only one place where God accepts worship as soon as provided please it says the word for your day amen the message of the hour that's where God accepts worship amen and God has allowed us to enter in because our blood issue has been healed is taken care of amen you believe that now let me let me close up here now notice that this is the eyes to see brother bam said is in the heart the message the door inside the door 1958 he said on the inside of the heart is the eyes the eyes of understanding so what we're seeing with eyes of understanding the sound to see is to understand we understand with the heart amen as we said and so notice that remember you remember Simeon Simeon had he had been promised by the Holy Spirit that that his that he would see amen the Messiah the savior of Israel amen before before he would go is that right and according to the promise of the Holy Ghost one day he he rose up by the spirit brother bam said he was in a study room the spirit of God Rose him up led him straight to the Christ amen you know what what day that was you know what he said he said my eyes have seen thy salvation thou let thy servant depart in peace amen in Shalom amen but that was the Bible says that was on the eighth day that they brought Jesus to the temple it was on the eighth day that his eyes seen the salvation is that right according according to the law they had to bring the children for circumcision on the eighth day and I believe that's what is taking place see we can also see when we remember a man in Saint John chapter 9 that was born blind remember that and the disciples asked Jesus whose sin his mother his father who sinned he said no one no one's sinned but that the glory of God oh so that the works of God could be made manifest brother Benham said that this man had no eyeballs in his socket amen he had no eyeballs in his socket is that right but Jesus amen he's spat on the ground made some mud is that right I remember one brother I first went out to Arkansas and he said brother we believe it all here he said he said I believe when brother Ram spit on the ground it was thus said the Lord he said that's scriptural because Jesus put on the ground one time and made some mud and man received his eyes but when he put the mud on his eyes amen what did Jesus tell this blind man said go wash in the pool of Siloam Siloam amen oh you see if you study it that pool of shalom it was in Solomon's Temple amen and then Solomon's Temple they had a water a water uh Aqueduct or work set that field these pools in the temple amen and the water came from the mountains of Judea from a spring called The Virgin Spring amen I'm making this up this is a h is in the Lexicon you just hit Siloam and you find them but what's interesting about this is that that water flowed from The Virgin Spring and wrote down some channels there float flowed down went into the temple and there was a first initial pool that would get filled with water amen a pool of water and then when that was filled it would overflow and it dropped into a second pull you you understand and in that that pool that pool of water would get filled amen with water and then when that was filled up it would it would overflow into a third pool and guess what when Jesus told this blind man and put mud on his eyes said go wash your eyes in the third pool amen that was actually the the spool of Siloam was the third pool in Solomon's Temple the poor of Shalom was also called The King's pool amen Lord of God when that sword dropped in his head he said this is a sword of the king amen it's the third post of indication of your ministry amen and that was the type of the book The open book coming into his hand to open the seals so that our eyes can come open amen because you and I we were born blind amen we were born blind we were born in sin shaped in iniquity when we were born into this world we're blind as a bat not naturally but spiritually our eyes could not see the Blue Ribbon Hallelujah glory to God but now that we've washed our eyes in the third pool amen our eyes come open our eyes come open amen and we see the Blue Ribbon amen Lord of God we wash our eyes in the king's pool amen Hallelujah Because by the time we got there the first and second we're already field so amen and our eyes are open now our eyes have been opened and we see and when we see hey man we remember and you know what that reminds me of brother brother Billy Paul telling that testimony amen of something like that happened in our day see that little girl come up with no eyeballs in her sockets just like just like that manner Saint John is that right she said so you told everybody closure I said really really said I wasn't watching watch amen says he prayed for he said light be gonna come all over our eyes amen God began to create he didn't put no mud on him created them power of God creating eyeballs in her sockets hey man Hallelujah glory to God he created eyes in our heart brother so that we could see amen by the third pool of power the eagle anointing brother bam said what good it is to fly so high and not see anything say about the higher the eagle flies the farther he sees Hallelujah I shall have anoint the eyes with eyes sap amen that let me see and he said then he forgot I forgot to ask you what color you want them guess what color she picked amen hey hey man she said I want I want blue I've heard Blues nice amen I've heard about the Blue Ribbon a little bit so I want that I want the blue I want the eagle anointing amen Hallelujah and brother Billy said two streets of blue light come down amen says said yes she had the most beautiful blue eyes you can think of oh brother sister what things God has done you believe that he said that the great messenger Among Us now the great Christ the Holy Spirit he's he's made Vivid he's made understanding see eyes of understanding he also said in the future home the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word not some system would have a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear you understand it you watch it vindicate itself it's eyes of understanding Brethren sound something within us that can see these things amen but notice I want to finish with this year I won't read the scripture I'll just quote it to you a whole lot of other things we can talk about also the garments priests the priest garment and the inner veil of the Tabernacle had four colors to it is that right those four colors they were purple red Scarlet white linen and the fourth color was blue and the type of the four gospel four living creatures Matthew was pertaining to the lion the king the royalty purple color amen Mark was the ox the sacrifice the red blood the Scarlet amen Luke was the man without sin faultless spotless clean white Jesus Christ coming to the Earth perfect man white but the fourth the eagle John amen his color was the blue see Spirit of Truth The Blue Ribbon The Eagle anointing amen showing us that the eagle he flies into the into the blue amen he goes to the highest part he dwells in blue amen he dwells in the Blue Area Hallelujah is that right see it's a Heavenly age it's a Rapture age brother bam said amen wordage amen it's the age of the Blue Ribbon amen Lord of God but oh yes stand on your feet amen like I said we get into many things I'll quote to you the scripture first Samuel chapter 15. verse 26 to 28. speaks of Saul Saul he had he had the word for his age he had a Samuel the prophet is that right Samuel had it anointed him as king he had the word for his days Saul did but in that scripture that I just quoted to you something happened or so he began to go astray begin to listen to the people remember Samuel told him to kill everything amen and he didn't obey he said obedience is better than sacrifice you remember the scripture but what's tremendous about that scripture is the Bible says there first Samuel 15 26-28 that because of that Samuel the prophet he told song he said this this day God is taking the kingdom away from that right he's giving it to another the Bible says that Saul grab a hold of Samuels garment the Hem of His Garment the skirt that's what we're talking that's where that blue ribbon is but what was different about this is that the Bible says that it ripped that was symbolizing of what Samuel had just prophesied to him so after he went his own after his own understanding he lost the grip of this garment you understand he lost grip of His Garment I believe God has given us this God I believe God has given us to grab a hole of the hymn of the Border The Fringe where this Blue Ribbon is amen you believe that and just like Saul many today have lost grip of it amen have tore it and what happened he lost his position he fell away from his place it's the same thing today many are they're losing this sight they're losing their Grit of the Garment they're they're tearing the Blue Ribbon apart amen they're tearing these things at God has done he's tied all these loose sins for us to grab a hold of him not to tear it not to do what we want with it but to hold on to it to draw virtue from it amen and he lost his position and I believe there's a bride in this hour amen that'll hold on right to the end she knows amen as long as I'm holding on to this see not hanging in somebody's coattail no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about holding on to the word is the Garment the word that's what we're holding on to in this hour you believe that musicians were played please Softly God has opened Our Eyes by the system sometimes brother random says the church begins to lose their Vision you know what the scripture said the individual also begins to lose his vision our vision becomes dim so he said anoint your eyes with Isaacs you may see so we can look amen with our heart unto the blue ribbonate something to hold us in this hour something to keep us amen and he said a people without Vision they perish and you see that you see a great Falling Away taking place in the south in the message they're losing their grit amen tearing this this Blue Ribbon apart they they have it there just like Saul did he had it all you had to do was just obey amen obey the voice Samuel the prophet there the word for his hour instead of holding on to the Garment he tore it he ripped that's what happened to the Pentecostals they had brother Bradham amongst them they had them right there just like Saul had Samuel but when he gave them certain orders and began to preach the word to him they couldn't hold on any longer amen in the Garment to him it was ripped it's given to another amen and I believe that's you and me in this hour but there's still many today you know they're losing it they're ripping falling from their place amen there's a there's a bride in this hour there's a church that's called to take her position and take her place in Christ he said she'll not follow amen she'll hold on so let's draw from the fountain this morning or this day amen let's draw virtue for whatever needs you have brother sister with our eyes closed amen and our hearts surrendered to him don't you just want to touch him don't you just want to draw virtue for your life we want something to hold us amen something to really keep us amen when all else has failed something there amen something that holds us Hallelujah Heavenly Father we realize oh God your grace to us in this hour Amazing Grace Lord we realize father that you're still the same
