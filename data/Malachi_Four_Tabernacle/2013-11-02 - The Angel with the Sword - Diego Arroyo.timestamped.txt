[0:00] want no
[0:02] unbelief inheriting his
[0:04] promise is that right God doesn't want
[0:08] unbelief possessing the things that he
[0:11] has promised his children amen that's
[0:14] why it was only to those who
[0:18] believe it it's a strange
[0:20] thing that if if we read the
[0:24] story in the Book of
[0:26] Numbers chapter one you find God
[0:31] commanding
[0:34] Moses and we preached on this
[0:38] before how that in Numbers chapter
[0:42] 1 verse three you you find and you
[0:47] read that whole first chapter second
[0:51] chapter it's it's uh Moses commanding
[0:57] that the
[0:58] names of all all the
[1:01] Israelites of every tribe from 20 years
[1:06] old and upward to be
[1:10] registered notice the registration or
[1:14] the
[1:15] recording of the
[1:17] names amen being being being written
[1:21] down in this book and it says when the
[1:25] time comes amen this book will be open
[1:29] and the names that are written in the
[1:32] book shall there be an inheritance
[1:36] given and he said that in numbers one
[1:40] that those that were from 20 years and
[1:43] and
[1:45] upward they will go into the land and
[1:48] they would fight is that right amen amen
[1:53] hallelujah I like how God does
[1:55] things because he likes to flip things
[1:58] right around the devil amen
[2:00] because the devil heard those
[2:03] words do you know what he did he focused
[2:07] all his all his attack on that group of
[2:11] people from 20 years old and
[2:13] upward and when the devil heard that
[2:17] amen God allowed him God told the devil
[2:21] okay do all you want with this group of
[2:24] people from 20 years and upward they're
[2:28] yours amen you know what the devil did
[2:31] he gave them
[2:32] unbelief he made them murmur he made
[2:35] them complain he made them caus all this
[2:39] to befall
[2:41] Israel amen and what happened Hallelujah
[2:46] when the time of crossing over came amen
[2:49] God probably asked the devil are you
[2:52] finished you already got all of them you
[2:56] got don't don't don't forget one of them
[2:58] you got all of them now
[3:00] okay all right that's okay because now
[3:05] from 20 we and
[3:07] downward are the ones that are going to
[3:09] cross over Hallelujah 20 years and
[3:12] upward are going to die and perish in
[3:15] the
[3:16] wilderness you see how God did
[3:19] that you see that that's a type in this
[3:23] house
[3:25] amen that God is showing
[3:28] us how he works amen this is in his
[3:33] word amen because in Numbers Chapter
[3:38] 14 he
[3:41] tells he tells them amen
[3:45] all of those from 20 years and upward
[3:51] shall not go into the
[3:54] land what were they going to go into the
[3:56] land
[3:57] for they they were going to go in to
[4:00] possess it to fight for it to fight off
[4:04] the
[4:06] inhabitants amen and possess what God
[4:09] given
[4:11] me and he says only Joshua and
[4:15] Caleb from those from that
[4:18] generation amen will go
[4:21] in but all the rest will not go in
[4:25] Hallelujah am so showing you from 20
[4:29] years
[4:30] and
[4:31] downward then we're going to cross over
[4:34] to the
[4:35] land but that's how God does
[4:37] things amen he allows the
[4:41] devil many times to hear his
[4:44] plans that's why he said in the seventh
[4:48] seal amen he said I can't say much more
[4:51] about
[4:52] this because if I if I say something
[4:55] else he said the devil will hear it but
[4:58] I must keep it to myself myself I must
[5:01] keep it in my bosom amen and brother
[5:05] said it's still a secret amen so there's
[5:09] part of that seven
[5:10] seal that yet is a
[5:13] secret amen hasn't been spoken hasn't
[5:16] been
[5:17] given the same thing it was concerning
[5:21] that third pool
[5:22] amen so we
[5:24] see that in in these things God allows
[5:28] sometime
[5:31] his enemy to
[5:33] hear sometimes he doesn't
[5:36] allow Amen to
[5:38] hear cuz brother said Satan can do great
[5:44] damage he if he would hear
[5:46] that he'll do great
[5:50] damage and he never heard
[5:54] it and with all that he's still doing
[5:57] great
[5:58] damage
[6:00] true but not like he would
[6:03] have if he would have
[6:05] heard right yes sir
[6:10] notice we see Revelations
[6:16] 10 the
[6:18] angel coming down we gave this the other
[6:21] day at a Bible
[6:25] study but we want to look into this
[6:28] now
[6:29] Amen to C the inspiration of his
[6:32] spirit and that's why brother
[6:35] said many times there's you have to
[6:38] understand there's difference between uh
[6:41] preaching and teaching
[6:47] amen says the same holy
[6:49] spirit that saves the sick that heals
[6:52] the sick but the anointing is different
[6:56] did you know that did you know there's
[6:58] an anointing for for
[7:00] healing there's an anointing for
[7:03] discernment there's an anointing for
[7:05] preaching amen and then there's
[7:07] anointing for
[7:10] teaching that's what brother ra said
[7:12] many
[7:13] times after he would
[7:15] preach he would say now you know what
[7:18] I'm
[7:18] doing he says I'm getting away from the
[7:22] anointing of
[7:23] preaching because I want to get into
[7:25] this other anointing
[7:28] now see Hallelujah he says I have to
[7:31] settle
[7:32] down amen I have to talk he said that's
[7:36] why I'm talking to
[7:37] you amen and then after he would talk
[7:41] then he would he would say now I'm ready
[7:44] amen see and he would begin to call a
[7:47] line and all these
[7:50] things so we see now
[7:53] look here the angel brother mam said
[7:57] that this
[7:58] angel amen of Revelations
[8:01] 101 was the angel of the Covenant I
[8:03] believe
[8:04] that he said it was Christ amen coming
[8:08] down amen clothed In This
[8:11] Cloud and in his hand he had a open
[8:16] book is that right now notice the
[8:21] significance of that book amen the book
[8:24] is not closed the book is open the book
[8:28] is not sealed amen it's open and in
[8:32] Joshua 5 we find when Joshua is ready to
[8:36] take amen the land or the city of
[8:40] Jericho amen this is powerful because
[8:44] this is where you and
[8:45] I come in to this uh revelation of this
[8:51] word because we understand that today
[8:56] there's a great debate amen of what the
[8:59] Joshua commission
[9:01] is amen as one old brother
[9:04] said amen now every day everywhere you
[9:08] look there's a
[9:10] Joshua a Joshua here a Joshua there here
[9:14] Joshua there Joshua everywhere
[9:17] Joshua amen he said but really when we
[9:22] look into the word amen into the
[9:25] scripture and we're talking about not
[9:27] the name Joshua but we're talking about
[9:30] that people are
[9:32] Ministries they they they
[9:34] claim men to be
[9:38] Joshua where the message people would
[9:41] only look into it it would show you
[9:45] different amen if if you would see amen
[9:49] that that brother Bram
[9:51] said one one time Amen in the late
[9:55] 50s he was studying the scripture
[10:10] and afterward brother ROM said there
[10:13] came a
[10:14] Bible that came down from
[10:17] heaven now notice the significance in
[10:20] the
[10:21] vision brother said the Bible came down
[10:25] from heaven as a book came down to us in
[10:29] this age from
[10:31] Heaven Jesus said Hallelujah I am the
[10:34] bread of life that have come down from
[10:37] heaven he that eats of me shall never
[10:42] die is that right and what is that when
[10:46] that book came down in in verse 8 to 11
[10:52] of chapter 10 that angel tells John eat
[10:56] The
[10:57] Rook amen amen so this book is to be
[11:00] eaten this book amen is the bread of
[11:04] life is that right Hallelujah this book
[11:08] Hallelujah is the word of
[11:12] God but when it comes in the hour which
[11:16] we all
[11:18] know when this Angel the
[11:20] com none other than the Lord Jesus
[11:23] Christ with the rainow over his head
[11:27] coming in power according to his own
[11:31] prophecy of Matthew
[11:33] 24 coming according to Daniel
[11:37] 7 coming according to all these
[11:39] prophecies in the
[11:41] scripture amen that he had
[11:44] prophesied and he comes amen with this
[11:47] open book and when
[11:50] Joshua amen is here and he had been
[11:54] given this
[11:55] commission hallelujah amen to do what to
[12:00] divide the land to divide the
[12:03] inheritance to give to the children of
[12:06] Israel by discernment
[12:09] that's by
[12:11] discernment he was to divide the land
[12:15] because each one of their names had a
[12:18] significance and that
[12:20] significance had to do with what their
[12:23] position was going to be if ephra mean
[12:27] corn Raiser
[12:29] you weren't going to make go over there
[12:32] and have a raised
[12:33] cattle that's not
[12:35] deserving amen you were going to place
[12:38] him in the position according to his
[12:42] name so Joshua had to have
[12:47] discernment understanding revelation of
[12:51] what the names
[12:54] mean that's
[12:56] power Joshua had to understand
[13:00] what the names meant Amen in order to
[13:03] divide the
[13:04] land according to their names Hallelujah
[13:08] am and the same is promised us in this
[13:11] hour brother mam said
[13:13] Ephesus is parallel with
[13:16] Joshua why is it parallel with Joshua
[13:19] because in Joshua is where they had
[13:23] already crossed over into the land and
[13:26] they were being placed every man
[13:29] was being given a measure of that
[13:35] land Hallelujah and brother said
[13:38] Moses was a type of
[13:40] Jesus and he led the
[13:44] people amen all the way up to Jordan he
[13:48] said but Jesus didn't take him
[13:50] over is that right he died he was
[13:55] crucified but when he rose
[13:57] again Joshua
[14:00] commission the Holy Spirit came in and
[14:04] begin to position the
[14:06] people in the New Testament and when it
[14:09] comes Amen to the ministry of
[14:12] Paul being raised up he begins to
[14:19] position the people in the alpha
[14:23] church and brother said amen and the
[14:28] Paradox message
[14:32] 1965
[14:34] notice Joshua
[14:36] here is a book of
[14:40] redemption Joshua is the book of
[14:44] redemption of the Old
[14:49] Testament did you get
[14:51] that what are we talking about this book
[14:55] that came down from heaven was
[14:57] what it was a book book of
[15:01] redemption that book of
[15:03] redemption seal
[15:05] withal right amen amen amen is that true
[15:10] yes is yes sir what was that book it was
[15:14] the book that had been given unto Adam
[15:17] in the
[15:18] beginning which
[15:21] names of the predestinated
[15:25] seed that were to be manifested upon the
[15:28] Earth
[15:30] what's on that book it's not a literal
[15:32] book it's the mind of
[15:35] God that he wrote your
[15:37] name before the foundation of the
[15:40] world and the lamb was
[15:42] slain in the mind of God and we were
[15:46] slain with
[15:48] him that's what he said in the message
[15:50] serpent
[15:53] seed amen amen
[15:56] notice when this book comes
[15:59] down in Revelations
[16:01] 10 it's open is that
[16:04] right
[16:05] Hallelujah and when
[16:08] Joshua sees this
[16:14] man
[16:16] amen he sees him brother
[16:19] said that that
[16:21] man the pillar of
[16:24] fire that had led the children of
[16:27] Israel who was that
[16:30] Christ said it was
[16:32] Christ the of
[16:36] fire amen amen and if you realize
[16:41] remember when
[16:43] Paul speaks
[16:46] of
[16:48] Moses he would
[16:51] rather forsake
[16:55] Egypt amen MH amen and forsake to be
[16:59] called a son of the sister of
[17:06] pharaoh amen amen is that right and and
[17:09] and he he chose he he chose a
[17:14] reproach of
[17:16] Christ greater
[17:18] riches is that right amen so he was
[17:21] taking the reproach of
[17:24] Christ see brother said that shows you
[17:28] who he was following in the
[17:30] wilderness is that right
[17:34] amen but in Exodus
[17:38] 23 verse
[17:41] 20 it says behold I sent an angel before
[17:44] thee to keep thee in the way and to
[17:46] bring thee into the place which I have
[17:55] prepared beware of him and obey his
[17:58] voice amen provoke him not for he will
[18:01] not pardon your transgressions for my
[18:02] name is in
[18:12] him but thou sh indeed obey his voice
[18:15] and do all that I speak then will I be
[18:18] an enemy to thy enemies and an adversary
[18:20] to thy
[18:27] adversaries
[18:30] for my angel shall go before thee and
[18:32] bring thee unto the unto the amorites
[18:35] and the Hittites and the hites and the
[18:38] Canaanites and the hites and the
[18:40] jebusites and I will cut them
[18:53] off Amen brother
[18:56] said that's the angel of the Covenant
[18:59] amen he preached a message obey the
[19:02] voice of the
[19:04] Angel amen amen what was he speaking of
[19:09] he was speaking of the same
[19:12] thing in our day this angel came back
[19:17] down again to do what Amen to bring us
[19:22] into this promised
[19:24] land to bring us into a dividing of
[19:30] inheritance that is within the book of
[19:34] redemption because Joshua it's a book of
[19:37] redemption but
[19:40] Joshua did not
[19:43] open until they crossed the
[19:46] Jordan see because the Joshua
[19:51] commission said in this
[19:54] Vision I saw the book coming down
[19:59] and the book was
[20:00] open this is in brother's Vision amen
[20:05] the Bible comes down but the Bible's not
[20:19] closed see a great
[20:22] hand and a finger begin to read amen
[20:29] chter 1 verse
[20:32] one
[20:34] Amen to
[20:37] verse and if you read that that's the
[20:40] that's the
[20:41] commission of
[20:43] Joshua Hallelujah after
[20:46] Moses I died brother said
[20:50] Moses is the top of the
[20:52] law Moses amen and Joshua existed at the
[20:57] same time time he said but Joshua could
[21:01] not come into full
[21:05] ministry until Moses
[21:09] died now
[21:11] notice brother
[21:14] says
[21:17] hallelujah
[21:19] Redemption is in two
[21:21] parts Redemption
[21:24] anywhere has two parts is to come out of
[21:28] and to go into it takes two parts to
[21:32] make
[21:33] Redemption Moses represented the law and
[21:37] brought them out of Egypt whereas
[21:40] Joshua represented Grace and took them
[21:44] into the promised
[21:46] land law and Grace were two different
[21:50] aspects of God's
[21:53] command this is paradox message
[21:57] 1965 and he says the law brought them
[22:00] out and Moses and and Joshua took them
[22:04] in it's also represented for our
[22:08] day and now it
[22:11] represents that as they were in the
[22:13] journey so have we come out of Egypt
[22:18] chaos and we're on our road to the
[22:20] promised
[22:22] land in my father's house are many
[22:26] manions Hallelujah did you get that amen
[22:30] it's law that brings us to
[22:34] recognize that we're wrong but it's
[22:37] Grace That Forgives
[22:41] usj law has no hope of redemption
[22:46] hallelujah hallelujah it has no Grace in
[22:49] it because law only points to you that
[22:53] you are a
[22:54] sinner but Grace tells you to get out of
[23:00] itall laws of
[23:03] policemen that put you in jail but
[23:06] Redemption is the one who paid the
[23:09] F to bring you out
[23:13] Hallelujah to out of and into
[23:17] Grace the
[23:19] Ephesus we find the same
[23:21] thing in the Old Testament in the Book
[23:24] of Joshua the book of Ephesians
[23:28] is the Book of Joshua of the Old
[23:32] Testament the book of Ephesians of the
[23:35] old test is the Book of
[23:39] Joshua see it's the same thing it's the
[23:44] position but when Joshua raised
[23:47] up he brought an exodus into the
[23:51] land Hallelujah and we're taught in the
[23:55] Book of Revelation listen
[23:59] that the Seven
[24:00] Seals the book to be sealed up with
[24:03] seven
[24:05] Mysteries amen the Seven Seals that in
[24:08] the last
[24:09] day Revelations
[24:11] 10 we find out that the Le see the last
[24:17] messenger of the last age during the
[24:21] time of his
[24:22] prophecy the Seven Seals would be open
[24:26] the seven Mysteries
[24:28] would be unfolded that had been left out
[24:32] now notice we promised according to
[24:35] Revelations
[24:37] 10 that all these things that the
[24:41] reformers had left out they had taken
[24:44] the church up to a certain point brother
[24:49] says Moses was a type of the
[24:52] denominational
[24:54] ages why he said because the denom
[24:57] ational
[24:59] ages and the churches glorified
[25:03] themselves and brother said Moses
[25:07] glorified
[25:08] himself when God told him speak to the
[25:12] Rock and he didn't speak to it he smoted
[25:16] it amen and brother said The Rock still
[25:19] brought
[25:21] Waters but Moses had to pay the
[25:23] price for
[25:25] disobeying what God told him to do
[25:28] but he showed the people that he could
[25:31] bring the
[25:32] waters see by him hitting the
[25:35] Rocks when all he had to do was just
[25:38] speak to him Amen to show that the power
[25:41] wasn't in him it was in
[25:45] God yes but when he did that brother
[25:49] said he was glorifying himself before
[25:50] the
[25:51] people and you know that was the exact
[25:55] thing that did not let him go into the
[25:57] pro
[25:59] but yet
[26:00] Grace took him into the
[26:03] promise Hallelujah is that right because
[26:07] there he stood in Matthew
[26:11] 17 in the promised
[26:13] land Hallelujah with Moses with Elijah
[26:17] and
[26:18] Jesus Hallelujah so he did come in by
[26:24] grace even even even at that time
[26:28] Hallelujah when the time of his death
[26:31] came which he wrote of his death is that
[26:34] right in the book of
[26:36] jomy and Moses died and no one knows he
[26:40] is
[26:41] buried and Moses was right so he knew
[26:44] his time was coming hallelujah
[26:47] hallelujah but you know what the Bible
[26:48] shows us that during that time
[26:51] Hallelujah that he was going
[26:54] away when he fell upon That Rock Amen
[26:57] amen the Bible shows us amen that
[27:01] Michael the great Archangel came down
[27:05] Amen to take up his body Hallelujah and
[27:09] take him up to the sixth
[27:11] Dimension glory to
[27:14] godu amen he said I got to use
[27:17] this for for future
[27:20] references Hallelujah for future
[27:25] events I got to use this body
[27:29] I need
[27:31] am come
[27:32] on to
[27:34] God yes sir if you ever
[27:38] notice every time everywhere
[27:41] Michael is mentioned it has to do with
[27:45] Resurrection it has to do with
[27:47] bodies the voice of the
[27:50] Archangel
[27:53] Hallelujah and Jesus said in St John 5
[27:57] now is the time that those that are in
[28:00] the voice those that are in the in the
[28:03] grave shall hear the voice of the Son of
[28:07] God read it and then he says but the
[28:10] time is coming hallelujah amen that's
[28:13] what he said he said now is the time
[28:16] when those that are in the grave shall
[28:18] hear the voice of the Son of
[28:20] God but the time is coming when all
[28:23] those who are in the grave shall hear
[28:26] the voice of the son of
[28:30] man oh my notice brother and sister what
[28:35] what is these things speaking
[28:37] of when when
[28:40] Moses amen amen was kept away then
[28:45] Joshua was able to raise
[28:46] up to bring the people into the
[28:49] land and what did crossing the Jordan
[28:54] mean what did that mean to us
[28:58] to them it meant amen going in and
[29:03] beginning to fight begin to
[29:06] possess begin to fight and drive
[29:11] away the
[29:12] inhabitant the land amen that's what
[29:15] that meant but to
[29:17] us what does it mean the message
[29:22] Paradox
[29:24] 1961 brother Ram says
[29:28] remember in this Vision I was coming
[29:32] down to Jordan now this is a different
[29:34] Vision now remember I already shared to
[29:38] you the vision for the book open coming
[29:43] down reading from Joshua verse 1
[29:47] to9 Dowing it to
[29:50] brother and he relates that
[29:53] Vision in the Paradox message 196
[30:00] he relates it in the 50s
[30:02] also but you'll find
[30:05] it in
[30:07] 1965 it brings up that Vision
[30:10] again when with
[30:13] connection of the opening of the
[30:16] seals that's what we just read to you
[30:26] there
[30:30] an adoption
[30:32] age there cannot be a
[30:35] positioning there cannot be an dividing
[30:37] of
[30:39] inheritance if the Seven Seals don't
[30:42] open you
[30:45] agree brother ra says in order for this
[30:48] Ephesians to
[30:50] come another
[30:52] Ephesians in the last days there has to
[30:56] be seven seas
[30:58] to be open according to Revelations 10
[31:02] according to Malachi 4 according of St
[31:06] Luke and
[31:09] Ephesians is promised
[31:11] us yes and there must come in this
[31:15] Ephesians that these Sevenfold
[31:19] Mysteries of the word of God must be
[31:22] unfolded and it is in the Le
[31:26] age see I believe we're in the
[31:30] shadows in the living of the coming of
[31:33] the Son of
[31:35] God and just as
[31:37] Joshua raised up just
[31:41] before the Ephesians raised
[31:45] up so listen to this then he takes it to
[31:49] the middle of the
[31:50] Bible so did John the
[31:53] Baptist raised up so that the next
[31:58] Ephesian could raise up but we promised
[32:03] another
[32:05] Ephesians you see how he did
[32:08] that so over there amen there was there
[32:13] was
[32:14] Moses following the pillar of fire is
[32:16] that right that was the angel of the
[32:19] Covenant amen but remember he had
[32:23] already he already told him obey the
[32:26] voice of the
[32:29] Angel brother said did you did you ever
[32:33] think why
[32:35] God like likes to
[32:37] use the ministry of
[32:40] Elijah so
[32:42] much he said because he always carried
[32:47] out his
[32:49] orders amen he said look at him he never
[32:54] one
[32:55] bit dis obey the orders of
[32:59] God so that's why God likes to use that
[33:04] Ministry five
[33:06] times hallelujah hallelujah amen
[33:11] amen but
[33:13] notice hoses had
[33:16] disobeyed the voice of the
[33:18] Angel is that
[33:20] right and all of these unbelieving
[33:24] people they could not cross over so when
[33:27] Joshua raises
[33:29] up amen they come into the promised land
[33:33] what happens that Pillar of Fire that
[33:36] was above them is no longer
[33:39] there amen
[33:41] amenu
[33:44] now it was easy during the days of
[33:48] Moses to just walk and walk and follow
[33:52] amen they were seeing these things and
[33:56] when the fire would begin to leave they
[33:58] would pack
[34:00] up and follow amen amen is that
[34:05] right but now there no Pillar of
[34:09] Fire amen what
[34:11] happened said the pillar of fire became
[34:14] a
[34:18] man the pillar of
[34:20] fire in human
[34:23] FLH
[34:25] yes
[34:27] and
[34:28] Joshua finds the pillar
[34:31] of
[34:33] human now who was the Joshua commission
[34:36] given
[34:37] to in our day Revelations
[34:42] 2:7 is that
[34:44] right and Revelations
[34:47] 101 is the Angel of the Covenant amen
[34:51] the same one that had led the children
[34:53] of Israel the same one that had Liv
[34:56] through the the church
[34:57] ages as the pillar of
[35:01] fire that's what brother Ram said the
[35:03] Feast of the trumpets he said he lived
[35:06] through the church
[35:08] ages as Pillar of Fire as Son of
[35:13] God hallelujah hallu but he promised to
[35:16] reveal
[35:17] himself Hallelujah in the last
[35:20] days as the son of
[35:23] man so would be the pillar of Fire in
[35:27] human flesh
[35:31] Discerning what did Brother Ram say
[35:33] about that
[35:34] Ministry he said that Ministry is
[35:38] Hebrews
[35:41] 42 and what does the scripture say the
[35:45] word of God is
[35:47] sharper than a two-edged
[35:53] sword amen
[35:55] amen
[35:57] why because it is
[36:00] AER of the thoughts and intents of the
[36:04] heart is that
[36:07] right so he took the discernment
[36:10] Hallelujah he took the
[36:13] ministry Elohim in human flesh to
[36:17] Hebrews 4:12 is that
[36:19] right to the sword amen
[36:25] discerning
[36:29] now
[36:31] when Revelations
[36:34] 101
[36:35] meets with Revelations
[36:38] 107 amen hallelujah he gives
[36:43] him the seven seal mystery
[36:49] Revelation is that right amen he gives
[36:52] up the full Plan of
[36:55] Redemption reveal
[36:58] and when and when
[36:59] Joshua Revelations
[37:02] 107 receives this
[37:05] amen
[37:08] notice there in in Joshua
[37:12] 5 amen verse
[37:16] 14 Joshua
[37:19] worships is that right amen and he and
[37:21] he
[37:23] says say what sayith my Lord unto his
[37:28] servant have you ever read in the book
[37:30] of
[37:31] Acts with the pillar of
[37:34] fire when Paul's telling his
[37:38] testimony the pillar of fire knocks him
[37:41] off his
[37:45] horse and he see this great
[37:47] light and he calls him Lord what were
[37:51] the words that Paul
[37:53] used what will my Lord have me to do
[37:58] amen the same words that Joshua uses
[38:02] here when he meets the P fire a
[38:06] man what will my
[38:09] Lord have me to
[38:12] do am there it is the same
[38:17] characteristics that Moses
[38:21] did in Exodus
[38:24] 3 when he met the pillar
[38:27] fire the burning bush same thing so what
[38:31] is
[38:32] it it's none other than Jesus
[38:36] Christ it's the angel of the coven but
[38:38] notice when that shows up the very next
[38:43] chapter is the conquest of
[38:46] Jero is that
[38:49] rightl but I want you to notice here
[38:51] we're going to read in Joshua chapter
[38:55] 6
[38:59] anden if we read Joshua chapter
[39:07] 6 read
[39:09] verse
[39:12] 25 and Joshua saved where he had the
[39:15] heart of the life in her father's
[39:18] household and all that she had and she
[39:21] dwelleth in Israel even until this day
[39:25] because she he The Messengers
[39:27] Joshua sent to SP
[39:46] Jero is that
[39:49] right
[39:50] Joshua
[39:54] saved Israel
[39:57] is that
[39:59] right but who gave him that
[40:04] command that commandment was given by
[40:07] the
[40:08] Lord but now
[40:10] notice notice these
[40:13] things when they cross over
[40:18] Jordan there was Kings All in This
[40:22] land and they had all
[40:25] heard
[40:27] herself she had
[40:42] heard that the that the Seas
[40:45] open that the the people vanish before
[40:49] him hallelujah amen that there was no
[40:54] King no Army
[40:56] withand
[40:58] them and the Bible
[41:02] says that there their hearts melted in
[41:10] fears so when we in this
[41:14] hour amen when there's a great crossing
[41:18] over of
[41:20] Jordan brother vam says there's a narrow
[41:25] pathway set in this
[41:28] Vision that was heading towards the
[41:31] Jordan and crossing over the Jordan and
[41:34] on the other side is where all the
[41:37] promises of God
[41:38] laid and then he goes
[41:41] on Amen and then he comes to the
[41:46] prophecy of Danny Henry Henry
[41:51] amen how many have ever thought about
[41:55] that you know the prophecy
[41:58] says because of this momentous
[42:02] decision a huge

[42:44] different portions to us up

[43:25] decision portion of Heaven awaits
[43:29] you now that's what I
[43:31] wondered will it be when I
[43:34] die then I happen to
[43:38] think Heaven's not portion off to
[43:40] different
[43:42] portions to us up there Heaven is the
[43:46] Kingdom of
[43:48] Heaven that's within
[43:52] us and one waits for
[43:56] see now

[44:02] victory in the love
[44:05] divine now you see what coming down to
[44:07] the Jordan
[44:10] meant we're down here now let's cross
[44:14] over Let's cross the other side now this
[44:18] is
[44:20] 1961 cuz it all belongs to us it's all
[44:24] ours the envisions have never failed
[44:26] they can't
[44:28] fail I believe it with all my
[44:30] heart we'll cross
[44:33] Jordan the
[44:35] separation God break to us the
[44:39] seals that's on the back side of the
[44:42] book let us enter into this great place
[44:45] now for
[44:47] Joshua divided the people their
[44:51] inheritance that God had left for
[44:54] them the
[44:57] all these things that we're seeing
[45:00] connecting Min of
[45:03] Joshua to the book of
[45:05] redemption to the dividing of The
[45:09] Inheritance amen within the promised
[45:11] land to the positioning of the children
[45:14] of
[45:15] God and to show you amen that these
[45:19] things we going to happen here
[45:23] spiritually the kingdom of God must be
[45:27] established in the heart of man right
[45:31] here see because if not we're thinking
[45:34] about something way off until the
[45:36] Rapture
[45:38] happens it has to happen now brother s
[45:41] these things are to be taken place in
[45:44] our lives when you recognize that a huge
[45:49] portion of heaven was given
[45:53] amen the seventh angel
[45:56] wow he was living amen what was that
[46:00] huge portion of
[46:01] Heaven Oh Glory to God it was a
[46:05] revelation of these Seven Seals it was
[46:08] this revelation of his own life his own
[46:12] Ministry his own the revealing of his
[46:15] own life within the word of God is what
[46:19] place positioned
[46:22] him into the office of a prophet yes sir
[46:27] because before that took place he was
[46:30] not in the office of a prophet amen he
[46:35] was born a prophet brother said a
[46:38] prophet is born a prophet he was
[46:40] Vindicated a prophet he was shown with
[46:43] different signs and wonders of a prophet
[46:47] but he was not in the office of a
[46:50] prophet amen and if you read taking size
[46:54] with Jesus
[46:58] 1962 says I always say I'm not a prophet
[47:03] he says I don't say that because I want
[47:07] to be
[47:09] humble amen amen he says I say that
[47:13] because I'm not in the office of a
[47:16] prophet he said God told me to do the
[47:19] work in of an
[47:20] evangelist and that's what I am a
[47:23] prophet don't
[47:24] evangelize a prophet don't go to
[47:27] churches and preach Doctrine no sir a
[47:32] prophet doesn't go here and preaches and
[47:35] goes over here the churches and try to
[47:37] gather them together brother bam said
[47:41] Prophet comes out of the Wilderness with
[47:43] thus sayth the
[47:46] Lord see and that's why when he was up
[47:50] on Sunset
[47:51] mountain in the wilderness in the desert
[47:55] they had met this Hallelujah Pillar of
[47:58] Fire and it came down with the open book
[48:03] The Sword was not in his sheath it was
[48:07] out of his she when Joshua seen this am
[48:11] man the sword was out of his sheep and
[48:15] when our Joshua seen this one he his
[48:19] book wasn't sealed his book was
[48:23] open
[48:24] Hallelujah yes sir but notice when that
[48:29] time
[48:30] come it put him Amen in the office
[48:35] because in
[48:36] 1965 he said first pool was Divine
[48:40] Healing second pool was Discerning the
[48:43] spirits third pool was the revealing of
[48:47] the word and then he said there's no
[48:50] higher
[48:52] office than a prophet for the revealing
[48:55] of the
[48:57] that's right anoint the ones at the end
[48:59] time Hallelujah so the raling of the
[49:02] seven
[49:04] SE put
[49:06] him in his position Hallelujah of the
[49:10] office of a
[49:13] prophet you believe that say
[49:17] amenu so when he comes into his
[49:20] position and he begins to come in and
[49:23] the Book of Joshua is open
[49:26] the book of the
[49:27] Redemption Hallelujah is open then we
[49:32] begin to see that the time comes
[49:36] hallelujah
[49:38] hallelujah when
[49:40] RAB to be
[49:42] saved let's go to Joshua chapter 2
[49:47] amen glory to
[49:54] God
[50:05] hallelujah amen look Joshua
[50:11] 2 verse four and the woman took the two
[50:15] men and hid them and said thus there

[51:22] Jordan unto the Forts and as as soon as
[51:25] they they which pursued after them were
[51:28] gone out they shut the
[51:38] gate before they were laid down she came
[51:40] up unto them upon the roof and she said
[51:44] unto the men I know that the Lord hath
[51:47] given you the land amen and that your
[51:51] terror is falling upon us and that all
[51:54] the inhabitants of the land think
[51:55] because of
[52:11] you for we have heard how the Lord DED
[52:13] up the water of the Red Sea for you and

[52:20] were on the other side of
[52:23] Jordan Sion and

[55:25] destruction is a time of judgment upon
[55:29] Jero what is Jero what does it
[55:32] represent Amen brother says
[55:37] Jero message
[55:39] blind
[55:42] 1954 Louisville Kentucky Kentucky
[55:46] Jero
[55:48] always was a wicked
[55:51] city as far as I know it's still a
[55:53] wicked City
[55:56] in the Bible it
[55:59] represents the roads to
[56:03] hell
[56:04] wow did you hear
[56:07] that
[56:08] Jero means what
[56:12] roads to
[56:15] Hell amen Amen brother man said there's

[57:25] and the and the token that
[57:28] Sheed during the opening Hallelujah of
[57:32] these
[57:34] seals now notice the display of the
[57:38] token was not going to
[57:40] be until that
[57:44] time read it in the scripture we
[57:47] read when the time of Destruction
[57:50] comes when we come to
[57:53] destroy that's when you're going to
[57:56] hang the
[57:59] Scarlet

[58:06] see
[58:07] that that she wasn't going to hang the
[58:11] token
[58:13] before the the time of Destruction was
[58:16] coming the reason that she was going to
[58:18] hang it is because they were going to
[58:21] come in to destroy the city
[58:26] is that right amen yes so notice it did
[58:31] not the token did not
[58:35] exist until the opening of the

[58:55] the roads to
[58:58] Hell Jero sits in the
[59:03] valley
[59:06] Jerusalem sits on a
[59:10] hill remember the Good
[59:13] Samaritan he found a man coming from
[59:18] Jerusalem to
[59:20] Jero when he fell among Thieves

[59:28] backsliding coming from

[59:38] City
[59:39] Jerusalem is a

[1:03:18] City
[1:03:19] amen is is is
[1:03:23] represented as a place a
[1:03:26] denomination that takes you to
[1:03:28] hell and notice he
[1:03:31] says it's also a type of
[1:03:36] backsliding just expect the
[1:03:39] enemy to be along the road when you
[1:03:43] start
[1:03:44] backsliding that's true Jericho was
[1:03:47] always a cur City this is thy faith has
[1:03:50] saved
[1:03:51] thee Jericho was always a cursed City
[1:03:56] since the Jews possessed
[1:04:00] Palestine Joshua
[1:04:02] said cursed is the
[1:04:04] man that will build this city
[1:04:09] again after it been
[1:04:11] destroyed Jero was
[1:04:15] represented always
[1:04:18] represented as a backsliding cursed
[1:04:22] City amen and Jericho had heard what God
[1:04:28] was doing but they didn't want to take
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] warning and there's not a
[1:04:35] denomination in this country or around
[1:04:39] the world but what's heard what God is
[1:04:43] doing in our
[1:04:45] mid but they don't want to take the
[1:04:49] warning see brother didn't leave it over
[1:04:52] there he brought it to president int
[1:04:54] Amen to show you where Jericho was to
[1:04:59] show you that Jericho is a system of
[1:05:03] denomination A system that is cursed A
[1:05:06] system that that leads you to
[1:05:09] hell right no matter how much they
[1:05:12] preach Christ to you in the
[1:05:14] cross they still lead you to
[1:05:18] Hell amen yes sir but what this what
[1:05:22] this Angel come to do
[1:05:25] is to give Joshua amen the
[1:05:27] instructions on how to destroy this
[1:05:30] system Hallelujah and when this angel
[1:05:32] came down he put one foot on the land
[1:05:36] and one on the sea why because
[1:05:39] Revelation
[1:05:40] 17 says that a beast comes from the
[1:05:43] water and Revelations 13 says that a
[1:05:47] beast comes from the
[1:05:49] Earth but this angel came down put one
[1:05:53] foot on the land
[1:05:54] and what on the sea to bind these
[1:05:57] systems to do what in order to release
[1:06:02] amen and for to apply the
[1:06:05] jok in the hour of judgment amen when
[1:06:09] seven tunders under their
[1:06:11] voices when seven trumpets are sounding
[1:06:14] amen glory to God Seven voices Hing out
[1:06:19] amen through one man at the P of

[1:06:35] always been against
[1:06:38] denomination I did not know until
[1:06:42] now that's what he
[1:06:45] said amen M but now
[1:06:49] notice they had
[1:06:51] heard denominations is heard
[1:06:55] they don't want to take a
[1:06:57] warning they must have
[1:06:59] believed that their own big denomination
[1:07:02] of
[1:07:04] Jericho is able to resist the wrath of
[1:07:09] God see what happened now they were shut
[1:07:15] up no Revival is going to happen
[1:07:18] here our
[1:07:20] denomination it won't sponsor such stuff
[1:07:26] will not have that kind of nonsense

[1:07:29] Us I forbid any of you to go to that
[1:07:34] meeting wow see who was saying that Jero
[1:07:40] wow amen M but notice what

[1:07:52] book men he gives it unto
[1:07:57] Joshua yes in the message standing in
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:02] Gap he says in Canyon that morning
[1:08:05] praying and wondering what would
[1:08:08] happen holding my hands out to
[1:08:11] God a sword dropped in my
[1:08:13] hand with a pearl
[1:08:16] handle
[1:08:19] Pearl and it's guard over it and a long
[1:08:23] bleed
[1:08:25] about three foot
[1:08:27] long and glistening like hot
[1:08:33] metal it was like
[1:08:36] Chrome or it was razor
[1:08:41] Shar and a voice spoke that shook the
[1:08:47] Canon said this is the sword of the Lord
[1:08:50] this is the sword of the Lord for the
[1:08:54] word of God is sharp you need
[1:08:59] two and what is the attraction on the
[1:09:02] mountain he says when it came and
[1:09:05] dropped him into my
[1:09:06] hand I Heard a Voice that said that's to
[1:09:09] King
[1:09:10] sword I said a king he kns a man with a
[1:09:16] sword he said The Voice come back and
[1:09:18] said not a king sword but the king
[1:09:22] sword the word of the Lord said fear not
[1:09:27] it's only the third
[1:09:30] pool it's only the third
[1:09:33] pool it's the
[1:09:35] Vindication of your
[1:09:38] ministry
[1:09:40] see hallelujah it's the Vindication of
[1:09:43] your
[1:09:44] ministry see the sword falling the hand
[1:09:49] the book coming from the angel to preach
[1:09:53] and reveal the Seven Seals what was
[1:09:55] brother Ram third
[1:09:58] pool is that right amen hallelujah and
[1:10:01] brother Ram
[1:10:02] says that that
[1:10:05] sword had three parts to
[1:10:09] it amen
[1:10:12] amen and he
[1:10:16] says that in that three
[1:10:21] parts he said one was revealed
[1:10:24] yesterday one
[1:10:27] today and another is in an unknown
[1:10:33] tongue amen
[1:10:37] hallelujah he says in the seven
[1:10:39] seal in Sao Canyon he said there's a
[1:10:43] third
[1:10:44] pool there's the three things that goes
[1:10:47] with it one unfolded today one
[1:10:52] yesterday see and the other one I cannot
[1:10:55] interpret because it's an unknown
[1:11:09] language yes yes right but yet it is a
[1:11:14] secret but when this when this shows
[1:11:18] here
[1:11:20] amen that the revealing
[1:11:25] of of these things have given
[1:11:28] us the application of the
[1:11:31] token which never existed in any other
[1:11:36] age not even in the Pentecostal
[1:11:40] age amen people
[1:11:44] Miss what the token really is
[1:11:47] amen see but
[1:11:50] notice when you begin to see that the
[1:11:53] sword of
[1:11:56] God is connected with
[1:11:59] Redemption but is also connected with
[1:12:03] judgment when that
[1:12:05] sword was out of his sheath in the days
[1:12:08] of
[1:12:11] Joshua it was showing two things
[1:12:15] Redemption and the opening of the book
[1:12:20] forab
[1:12:21] amen and Jud for
[1:12:26] Jero brother tells us of different
[1:12:31] scenes and the Bible does
[1:12:33] too if we go through these
[1:12:37] things amen amen some of these things
[1:12:39] you won't find in the Bible you just
[1:12:41] have to believe the
[1:12:43] prophet that's right yes sir amen amen
[1:12:47] he begins to tell
[1:12:48] us every time this
[1:12:51] Angel appears with his sword
[1:12:55] drawn or when he draws his
[1:12:58] sword there's
[1:13:00] Deliverance there's judgment amen and
[1:13:04] there's
[1:13:06] Redemption
[1:13:07] Hallelujah this is powerful because this
[1:13:11] is what has happened in our day and if
[1:13:14] you look at these different
[1:13:16] scenes all of those scenes in the Bible
[1:13:20] together are taking place today
[1:13:24] and the people who receive
[1:13:26] Mercy the grace of God the Redemption of
[1:13:30] God in those scenes were only a a a type
[1:13:36] of this antitype of this last being of
[1:13:39] the bride of Christ amen amen hallelujah
[1:13:43] and the ones who before that
[1:13:48] angel in front of that angel amen with
[1:13:51] that sword drawn not able to
[1:13:55] see what it is it's it's also a
[1:13:58] type of the church in our day that is
[1:14:02] blinded brother ra says in the teaching
[1:14:05] of
[1:14:07] Moses that
[1:14:09] amram Moses his father had gone into
[1:14:12] much prayer he had cried amen for the
[1:14:16] Deliverance of
[1:14:17] Israel and he said he would come home
[1:14:21] from work late and and
[1:14:24] tired after working all those hours but
[1:14:27] yet he would go up to the the attic part
[1:14:31] of the
[1:14:32] home amen and he would begin to pray and
[1:14:36] cry out to God and one and one time he
[1:14:40] prayed until he fall on the
[1:14:42] floor he couldn't go any farther he took
[1:14:46] a little nap and he woke up what's the
[1:14:49] matter he begin to see a light coming
[1:14:53] and look look in there in the corner
[1:14:56] there stood an angel with his sword
[1:14:59] hanging on his side and he rubbed his
[1:15:03] eyes he he pulled up on his
[1:15:06] knees he said Lord what do you want for
[1:15:10] me and he said am I am the angel of God
[1:15:15] I have been
[1:15:16] sent now notice I have come to you that
[1:15:21] he is going to send a deliver
[1:15:24] to tell you that these things will come
[1:15:27] to pass he remembers all of his
[1:15:31] promises I see the angel
[1:15:34] now says I look at him he's pulling out
[1:15:38] his
[1:15:39] sword and he point it to the North and
[1:15:43] am looks and he said just point his
[1:15:47] sword it lays towards the promised
[1:15:51] land now the angel points the
[1:15:54] sword he takes it out of the sheep and
[1:15:57] he points it towards the north towards
[1:16:00] the
[1:16:01] promise showing amen that when that
[1:16:05] angel with the with the sword come when
[1:16:07] it when it comes
[1:16:09] open in the promised land Hallelujah Not
[1:16:13] only was it going to be the
[1:16:14] Deliverance it was going to be so that
[1:16:18] you people will
[1:16:20] inherit that land I promised this is
[1:16:25] what the angel is telling am I promised
[1:16:29] Abraham Isaac and Jacob your fathers
[1:16:32] that you people would inherit this
[1:16:36] land and that's what this
[1:16:40] mean did you catch it what is it what
[1:16:43] did it mean brother he is there the
[1:16:47] angel but when abam sees him the sword
[1:16:52] is in a sheath
[1:16:55] Hallelujah but then all of a sudden when
[1:16:58] he takes it out he he he does something
[1:17:01] with it he points towards the north
[1:17:05] Hallelujah showing where the promised
[1:17:08] land Le and showing that there they
[1:17:12] would inherit the land that's what that
[1:17:17] meant hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:21] and notice man says that's what that
[1:17:26] means so when we come to the promised
[1:17:29] land and that angel or that man is there
[1:17:33] with a drawn
[1:17:34] sword amen it was the time for that for
[1:17:38] that promise to be
[1:17:41] fulfilled not only did he bring Israel
[1:17:45] out of
[1:17:46] Egypt but it was time for The
[1:17:49] Inheritance amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:54] it was time for The
[1:17:57] Inheritance Amen to be
[1:18:00] divided yes and we'll get into that just
[1:18:05] here in a few
[1:18:07] minutes show us the father suffices
[1:18:12] us
[1:18:14] 1950 brother says this Angel he's
[1:18:18] speaking of this Angel is All Through
[1:18:20] the Bible and always appears with a
[1:18:24] great
[1:18:25] sword wow hallelujah it's always the
[1:18:28] same
[1:18:31] one and he
[1:18:34] says the big
[1:18:37] sword was
[1:18:40] pulled
[1:18:43] amen David seen
[1:18:46] him you believe
[1:18:49] that amen hallelujah you believe that
[1:18:51] David seen David seen that
[1:18:55] angel let's go to First
[1:19:00] Chon
[1:19:05] 21
[1:19:07] amen 1 Chronicles
[1:19:10] 21
[1:19:12] verse this is when
[1:19:17] David
[1:19:19] amen listen to the
[1:19:21] devil
[1:19:24] amen he provoked
[1:19:26] David is that right do
[1:19:31] senses remember
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:35] amen and the Lord wasn't pleased with
[1:19:41] that is that right but what I like about
[1:19:44] God is that he gave David three
[1:19:50] choices to choose from
[1:19:54] amen he said what do you want you want
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:59] enemy to to take control of you
[1:20:03] amen you want three years of
[1:20:07] famine amen or or you want to be in my
[1:20:12] hands I'll
[1:20:15] you and they said I want in your
[1:20:19] hands if I let you put me in the hands
[1:20:22] of my
[1:20:23] enemy he say they're not like you you
[1:20:27] have mercy they
[1:20:30] don't
[1:20:32] amen so so David made the right choice
[1:20:36] amen after making some wrong choices he
[1:20:39] made some
[1:20:41] right and verse
[1:20:43] 15 and God sent an angel to Jerusalem to
[1:20:46] destroy it and he was destroying and the
[1:20:50] Lord beheld and He repented him of the
[1:20:52] evil and said to the angel that
[1:20:54] destroyed it is enough stay now thine
[1:20:57] hand and the angel of the Lord stood by
[1:20:59] the threshing
[1:21:21] floor and they up his eyes and saw the
[1:21:24] angel of the Lord stand between the
[1:21:26] Earth and the heaven having a drawn
[1:21:28] sword in his hand stretched out over
[1:21:30] Jerusalem then David and the Elders of
[1:21:32] Israel who were clothed in s cloud fell
[1:21:34] upon their
[1:21:51] faces
[1:21:53] a type of Christ amen in the time of
[1:21:57] judgment this Angel Hallelujah bringing
[1:22:01] judgment to Jerusalem what is Jerusalem
[1:22:04] what is the New Jerusalem is the bride
[1:22:08] of Christ and because of these
[1:22:11] things amen we're going to be
[1:22:16] fall
[1:22:18] upon
[1:22:19] Jerusalem the judgments of God
[1:22:23] through this angel with a sword drawn
[1:22:26] amen he's he he is between the Earth and
[1:22:31] Heaven but the
[1:22:34] intercession the
[1:22:35] elders amen begin to come
[1:22:40] in is that right now notice verse
[1:22:46] 27 you can read the story if You' like
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:50] you have a chance see
[1:22:55] verse
[1:22:56] 27 and the Lord commanded the angel and
[1:22:59] he put up his sword again into the Sheep
[1:23:06] thereof
[1:23:07] see because when the sword is out of the
[1:23:11] sheath it's
[1:23:14] judgment amen God ain't going to take
[1:23:16] the sword
[1:23:17] out just because to take it out he's not
[1:23:21] a bluff amen
[1:23:25] and that's why when he's when he
[1:23:27] appears in Revelations
[1:23:29] 10 said notice he's roaring like a lion
[1:23:34] he said the lion does not
[1:23:37] Roar until he has his
[1:23:39] prey right in front of
[1:23:42] him that's when he
[1:23:44] Roars amen and and it's the same thing
[1:23:47] with this because he has an open book he
[1:23:51] has a drawn Sword and the angel doesn't
[1:23:54] draw his sword just because he draws his
[1:23:58] sword because it's a time of
[1:24:00] judgment Hallelujah but in the time of
[1:24:03] judgment he shows Mercy
[1:24:06] amto David's lineage
[1:24:09] ameny to God so brother says David seen
[1:24:14] him with a big

[1:24:54] verse
[1:24:56] 22 and God's anger was kindled and
[1:24:58] because he went and the angel of the
[1:25:00] Lord stood in the way of adversary
[1:25:01] against him now he was riding upon his
[1:25:03] ass and his two servants were with
[1:25:17] him and they asked saw the angel of the
[1:25:20] Lord standing in the way amen and sword
[1:25:22] drawn in his hand and the ass turned
[1:25:24] aside out of the way and went into the
[1:25:26] field and B smoked the ass to turn her
[1:25:30] into the
[1:25:43] way but the angel of the Lord stood in
[1:25:46] the path of The Vineyards a wall being
[1:25:48] on this side and a wall on that
[1:25:51] side
[1:25:57] and when the saw that the angel of the
[1:25:59] Lord she thrust herself onto the wall
[1:26:03] and crushed B's foot against the
[1:26:05] wall and he SM her
[1:26:16] again and the angel of the Lord stood F
[1:26:18] went further and stood in a narrow place
[1:26:21] where there was no way to turn either to
[1:26:24] the right hand or to the
[1:26:38] left and what
[1:26:40] happens see bam keeps
[1:26:43] on hitting amen beating

[1:27:04] down and makes this and makes it this
[1:27:07] donkey speak
[1:27:09] amen is that right
[1:27:12] amen and look at verse
[1:27:16] uh verse
[1:27:18] 28 and the Lord opened the mouth of the
[1:27:21] ass and she said
[1:27:22] what have I done unto thee that thou has
[1:27:24] smitten me these three
[1:27:34] times and said unto the unto the ass
[1:27:37] because thou has mocked me I would there
[1:27:41] were a sword in my hand for thou now
[1:27:43] would I kill
[1:27:51] thee but see he didn't
[1:27:55] realize that an angel in front of him
[1:27:57] had a sword to kill
[1:28:02] him is that
[1:28:04] right and he wanted a sword to kill a
[1:28:08] donkey but yet he's having a
[1:28:10] conversation with the
[1:28:12] donkey and he's not
[1:28:14] realizing I'm talking to a
[1:28:20] donkey that's what brother saying
[1:28:23] he was so mad he didn't even know that
[1:28:27] he was talking to a
[1:28:29] donkey you know that happens sometimes
[1:28:32] when you get so mad you do
[1:28:35] things and eat too you know things like
[1:28:39] that you going to do things like that
[1:28:40] when you're bad right not realizing
[1:28:43] that's true
