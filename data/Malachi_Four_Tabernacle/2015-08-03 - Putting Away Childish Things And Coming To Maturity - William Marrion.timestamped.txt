[0:41] amen amen for we know in part in part
[0:47] and we in prophesy

[0:55] perfect has come then that which is in
[0:58] part shall be done away
[1:04] amen amen are we to prophesy in this
[1:09] hour hallelujah amen amen because
[1:13] remember Paul is saying in his
[1:16] age we prophesied in
[1:19] part but in this age Mighty Angel come
[1:23] down to say prophesy
[1:26] again amen amen so we are to prophesy
[1:31] but not in
[1:33] part

[1:39] come and that which is in part shall be
[1:43] done
[1:45] away when I was a child I speak as a
[1:47] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:49] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:52] away childish
[1:58] things

[4:05] we can have
[4:06] Fellowship around your word
[4:08] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:12] Christ amen may be
[4:15] seated hallelujah
[4:17] hallelujah as we were speaking this
[4:20] morning this is
[4:22] the age of
[4:26] adoption brother called it the
[4:31] dispensation of
[4:33] adoption he said there has been many
[4:37] dispensations the dispensation of the
[4:40] law dispensation of many different uh
[4:46] things he said this is a
[4:49] dispensation of adoption this is the
[4:52] season this is the
[4:54] time in which Paul is speaking
[4:57] of that we are to put away childish
[5:02] things amen amen this is what we want to
[5:06] uh take our text from
[5:10] today this evening amen amen from verse
[5:13] 11 of 1 Corinthians
[5:17] 13 amen put away childish
[5:21] things amen amen put away childish
[5:26] things amen amen or putting away
[5:30] amen because we're bringing it to the
[5:32] present
[5:33] T amen for us putting
[5:38] away away childish
[5:41] things now how many believe that this is
[5:45] that
[5:46] time according to brother
[5:48] Bram Amen in every age God dealt a
[5:53] portion is that right we were seeing
[5:56] that this morning and then when it come
[6:00] to this last day he gives a
[6:04] completeness just like he gave a portion
[6:06] in the
[6:07] prophets then when Jesus come it was the
[6:10] fullness he was the bridegroom then he
[6:14] said Through the
[6:15] Ages give
[6:17] portions but when this last day bright
[6:21] comes he is to give the
[6:24] fullness like he did in the
[6:26] brid to have the preeminence
[6:29] and the people in this last day to be
[6:33] anointed be filled with the fullness of
[6:37] God how many know that that's in the
[6:40] scripture Paul spoke of that of being
[6:44] filled with the fullness of
[6:46] God now in when we look at the
[6:52] stages of the church we have to realize
[6:56] something this is what I was trying to
[6:58] get at this morning morning but I I want
[7:01] to make it a little more clear
[7:03] tonight that when we look at the age
[7:07] that we're living in we have to
[7:09] understand the holy spirit for this hour
[7:14] is
[7:15] perfection amen the Holy Spirit giving
[7:18] given in this
[7:20] hour is not as it was
[7:23] given in the days of Luther the days of
[7:27] Wesley even in the
[7:30] Revival the Holy Spirit given
[7:33] today is to bring us to
[7:35] Perfection it's the spirit of Truth to
[7:38] lead us to all
[7:40] righteousness amen and that's the
[7:43] anointing of our
[7:44] hour that's the Holy Ghost given in our
[7:49] hour it's not a portion brother mam said
[7:53] it's not a gift of the Holy
[7:55] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost
[7:58] himself the person of Jesus Christ it's
[8:02] the token being King in this house
[8:06] believe now notice when we look then we
[8:11] we have to understand this brothers and
[8:13] sisters and that is that in this age is
[8:18] adoption time so as the as an
[8:23] age as a people as a body and even as
[8:28] individuals amen this is what we come to
[8:33] in this hour I I want to make it
[8:37] plain because we have to understand that
[8:41] in the days of
[8:42] Luther they only could get to
[8:46] justification they could only get to
[8:48] sanctification in the days of
[8:50] Wesley and that was all they could
[8:54] reach amen and the people that received
[8:56] the word in their day
[8:59] and see that life of the word that's
[9:04] what they would
[9:05] produce but this
[9:07] message produces adopted sons of
[9:11] God it produces the knowledge of the
[9:16] fullness of
[9:17] Christ in other words this message amen
[9:22] is what was
[9:24] needed for adopted
[9:26] son amen without the
[9:29] revelation of this message you cannot
[9:33] have an adopted son remember this
[9:36] morning we were speaking about how how
[9:39] that we can come to
[9:41] Perfection was only by a perfect
[9:44] message and the perfect
[9:47] interpretation but I want us to
[9:49] understand a little more in this because
[9:54] sometimes we look at it as though it's
[9:58] it's us
[10:00] as
[10:01] individuals wanting to get to the
[10:04] stature of a perfect
[10:06] man and in part that is true but it's
[10:12] not because as an aid is the anointing
[10:16] of the
[10:17] hour hallelujah hallelujah brother and
[10:20] sister we must come to the Holy Ghost in
[10:24] This
[10:25] Hour you get to the Holy Ghost in This
[10:30] that he comes into your soul that
[10:32] quickens you in this hour that is the
[10:35] Seal of the
[10:37] age brother R said that is the life
[10:42] given today so the Holy Ghost when it
[10:46] was when it was given into the hearts of
[10:50] the people in different
[10:52] ages it fulfilled the message for that
[10:56] hour Hallelujah amen that's why Paul
[11:00] says turn me to Romans
[11:03] 8 amen
[11:06] amen Romans
[11:09] 8 verse
[11:12] 14 for as many as L by the spirit of God
[11:15] they are the sons of
[11:20] God for ye have not received the spirit
[11:23] of bondage again the
[11:24] fear but ye have
[11:27] received the spirit
[11:30] s of
[11:33] adoption whereby we cry AB the
[11:48] father amen amen now notice something
[11:51] brother and sisters the spirit of
[11:55] adoption is the Holy Ghost
[11:59] yes there's nothing
[12:04] less we have not received a spirit of
[12:08] bondage again to
[12:11] fear amen amen we we have receive the
[12:16] spirit of adoption we go to the book of
[12:20] Galatians go to
[12:23] Galatians and we come to chapter
[12:27] 4 amen
[12:31] amen I mean
[12:34] Ephesians
[12:40] Gans gter
[12:44] 4 in verse one it
[12:46] says now I say that the heir as long as
[12:50] he is a child different nothing from a
[12:51] servant though he be Lord of
[12:57] all
[13:00] but his under tutors and governors until
[13:01] the time appointed of the father even so
[13:04] we we were children we're in bondage
[13:07] under the elements of the
[13:22] world now listen but when the fullness
[13:25] of time was come God sent forth his son
[13:29] Jesus Christ amen made of a woman made
[13:32] under the law to redeem them that were
[13:34] under the law that we might receive the
[13:37] adoption of
[13:51] sons now listen
[13:54] close speaks of this in the exposition
[13:57] Church ages
[13:59] that only the seat of God only elected
[14:03] of God only the predestinated of God
[14:07] that have a SE Gene in their soul can
[14:10] receive the Holy
[14:11] Ghost no one else amen hallelujah no one
[14:16] else can
[14:17] receive because he are
[14:20] Sons God have sent forth the Holy Spirit
[14:25] of his son into your hearts Hallelujah
[14:29] see into your hearts amen not on your
[14:32] flesh not in your spirit
[14:35] amen in your
[14:38] heart crying have a
[14:47] father see you are already a
[14:51] son when you were born in this
[14:54] Earth You Were A Son of God you had
[14:58] eternal life
[14:59] you didn't receive eternal life when you
[15:02] received the message when you came to
[15:04] the altar when you raised your
[15:07] hand you already had eternal
[15:11] life you were already a
[15:14] son Hallelujah but because you're a
[15:17] son he has to
[15:20] send
[15:24] Spirit into your
[15:27] heart notice what he says the spirit of
[15:32] his
[15:39] son the spirit of his
[15:45] son
[15:46] Glory brother that was the spirit that
[15:50] was in Christ that was the spirit that
[15:54] was obedient to the father that was the
[15:57] spirit that was can did nothing except
[16:00] he see the father do
[16:02] it hallelujah hallelujah that was the
[16:06] spirit John
[16:09] 59 amen hallelujah that was the
[16:14] spirit amen amen that was in Jesus
[16:18] Christ and that was
[16:21] obedient amen amen it was so
[16:24] obedient for that three years and a half
[16:28] amen
[16:29] it's all he took for God to adopt him
[16:33] Hallelujah and have a
[16:35] ceremony because that was the spirit of
[16:40] adoption and The Same Spirit of
[16:42] adoption was living inside of Jesus
[16:46] Christ he sends the spirit of his son
[16:51] amen into your
[16:54] hearts
[16:56] crying AB the father
[16:59] Hallelujah wherefore thou no more a
[17:01] servant but a son if a son than an heir
[17:04] of God through
[17:10] Christ is that right what does Ephesians
[17:13] 1
[17:16] say having predestinated us amen unto
[17:20] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[17:22] to himself according to the good
[17:25] pleasure of his
[17:27] will
[17:33] are we
[17:34] [Applause]
[17:35] predestinated amen remember last time I
[17:40] said if you're
[17:43] predestinated you have a
[17:49] destination
[17:52] predestinate
[17:53] right amen
[17:55] amen amen amen you're destined
[17:58] dination has already been pre-planned
[18:02] Hallelujah am glory to God in the mind
[18:06] of
[18:07] God the works you didn't
[18:11] display we spoke about the other day
[18:14] remember they were already finished
[18:18] before the foundation of the
[18:19] world Paul speaks of that
[18:24] also in Ephesians
[18:27] 2 amen amen listen to this Ephesians 2
[18:32] verse
[18:33] 10 for we are his workmanship amen
[18:37] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[18:41] which God have before
[18:45] ordained that we should walk in
[18:56] them amen these wordss are for
[19:00] ordained that we should walk in
[19:02] them Hallelujah
[19:06] predestinated to the adoption of
[19:09] sons brother and sister but we can talk
[19:13] about predestination all day
[19:15] long we can talk about it for years but
[19:19] unless the Holy Ghost comes into your
[19:23] heart quickens what's on the inside
[19:27] there's
[19:30] the evidence of
[19:33] predestination is not you believing in
[19:36] the doctrine of
[19:38] predestination the evidence of
[19:41] predestination is you
[19:44] receiving the spirit of his
[19:47] son in your
[19:49] heart because ye were
[19:52] son he sent the spirit of his son into
[19:58] your heart cry father it's the spirit of
[20:04] adoption
[20:06] Hallelujah the spirit of
[20:08] adoption not the spirit of
[20:11] bondage against
[20:14] Fe amen amen is that right but we
[20:18] receive says Romans
[20:21] 8:15 we receive 15 we receive the spirit
[20:25] of
[20:27] adoption where by we
[20:30] cry
[20:32] Father which
[20:34] means our
[20:36] God my
[20:39] God amen amen amen my
[20:44] father amen is that
[20:48] right so he has begotten
[20:51] us to be created into the very image of
[20:55] Christ amen let's go to Second Timothy
[21:00] 17 just real
[21:02] quick I didn't plan on doing this
[21:05] but had other
[21:08] plans Romans 8:15 then we we read
[21:12] that it says we have not been given the
[21:15] spirit of
[21:17] fear of
[21:19] bondage to
[21:21] fear and second
[21:23] Timothy
[21:25] 17 for God have not given us the spirit
[21:27] of fear but of power and of love and of
[21:33] sound
[21:39] mind brother the spirit of
[21:43] bondage was in
[21:45] Egypt
[21:47] amen is that
[21:50] right when they were in
[21:52] Egypt of bondage was upon
[21:57] them and that Spirit of
[22:00] bondage held them in
[22:02] fear for 400
[22:05] years but when they came out of bondage
[22:11] listen Into the
[22:13] Wilderness they still had the same
[22:17] spirit amen they still had
[22:23] fear they still had the spirit of
[22:26] bondage and they feared that they were
[22:30] going to die of thirst and they feared
[22:33] that they were going to die of hunger
[22:36] and they feared and they complained and
[22:39] they
[22:40] mured amen amen they still had the
[22:45] spirit of
[22:46] bage that came out of Egypt but Egypt
[22:50] never came out of
[22:54] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah but
[22:57] brother and sister
[22:59] there was some elected predestinated
[23:02] seed that was walking
[23:05] alongside of
[23:07] Moses Hallelujah am Oh Glory to God and
[23:12] out of that
[23:13] generation one out of a
[23:16] million went into the promised land to
[23:21] receive the spirit of
[23:24] adoption to be
[23:26] placed Hallelujah Hallelujah by
[23:29] Joshua the holy spirit amen
[23:35] hallelujah when the Bible says in
[23:38] numbers
[23:40] 13 that when the
[23:42] spies brought back an evil
[23:45] report people
[23:48] feared people
[23:50] melted amen hallelujah the people fear
[23:54] of the
[23:55] Giants of the land amen the spirit of
[23:59] fear was still upon them the spirit of
[24:04] bondage was still upon
[24:09] them they were following a
[24:11] prophet yet they were under the
[24:14] Cloud yet they were following the pillar
[24:17] of
[24:17] fire yet they were eating Heavenly
[24:20] Mana
[24:22] oh know they were baptized in the Red
[24:26] Sea Paul said these things were written
[24:28] for our
[24:32] example amen amen but they had the
[24:35] spirit of
[24:36] bondage and they
[24:38] again
[24:40] feared amen amen but the
[24:43] spirit of
[24:45] adoption said we are more than
[24:49] able the spirit of adoption said the
[24:52] promise is given unto
[24:54] us amen and we shall take the promise
[24:59] amen hallelujah hallelujah it shows
[25:02] today that

[25:04] theal yet under the spirit of
[25:09] bondage
[25:10] bondage

[25:15] why Paul is telling
[25:18] Timothy you have not
[25:21] received
[25:22] amen

[25:26] fear of power
[25:27] [Applause]

[31:34] God that right you say oh
[31:38] brother then what I feel in my
[31:41] heart Jeremiah says the heart is
[31:47] dece amen amen so it's not even what you
[31:50] feel in your
[31:52] heart because what you feel in your
[31:54] heart can be contrary to the word
[31:57] it's got to be the
[31:59] [Applause]
[32:02] word hallelujah amen
[32:05] so you know many
[32:08] times I feel it my
[32:12] heart remember you need to get that out
[32:14] of your
[32:16] [Applause]
[32:19] heart amen
[32:21] amen you
[32:23] see even though okay that's God's
[32:26] perfect
[32:29] amen amen amen it's in the third
[32:33] round but we always have to check
[32:36] it by the word not just because you feel
[32:39] it in your heart that means it's
[32:46] right
[32:47] [Applause]
[32:51] word now
[32:53] notice this is the thing that God
[32:57] has given us this mind this
[33:02] Spirit now remember Jesus
[33:05] said you do
[33:08] ear not knowing the power of
[33:11] God and the
[33:16] scriptures amen amen they were talking
[33:19] about how many wives this was going to
[33:21] have how many wives is that one going to
[33:25] have amen amen Jesus said
[33:28] you not knowing the power of
[33:31] God and the
[33:34] scriptures God is not a god of the
[33:37] Dead god of the
[33:41] living now
[33:43] notice
[33:46] Hallelujah Paul says in First
[33:48] Corinthians
[33:50] 2 First Corinthians 2 there's a little
[33:54] scripture
[33:55] here amen amen
[33:59] amen amen hallelujah verse
[34:05] 13 which things also we speak not in The
[34:08] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[34:10] which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[34:13] spiritual things with
[34:22] spiritual but the natural man receive
[34:24] not the things of the spirit of God they
[34:27] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[34:29] them because they are spiritually
[34:39] discerned but he that is spiritual
[34:42] judges all things yet he himself is judg
[34:46] of no
[34:50] man for who have known the mind of the
[34:53] Lord that he may instruct him we have
[34:57] the mind of
[35:05] Christ amen hallelujah is that right
[35:09] notice here this is a spirit of
[35:12] adoption the spirit of
[35:14] adoption amen it's the mind of Christ
[35:18] it's the
[35:19] fullness it's the
[35:22] intelligence amen amen that's the
[35:25] greatest thing that God could ever give
[35:29] Amen to his children is to give them his
[35:33] own mind his own spirit because the mind
[35:37] of man is the spirit of man hallelujah
[35:41] hallelujah it's not these it's these
[35:43] brains up here that you got in your
[35:46] sko amen it's your spirit that's your
[35:51] mind hallelujah hallelujah and if we
[35:53] receive the spirit of
[35:55] Christ receive the mind of Christ and we
[35:59] let the mind that was in
[36:01] Christ in you Hallelujah where he bed
[36:05] not
[36:07] robbery to be equal with God hallelujah
[36:10] hallelujah but he made himself a form of
[36:15] a servant and he come down to be
[36:19] obedient to the father obedient to the
[36:23] word obedient to the command of
[36:29] God hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[36:32] reason why brother many people Ain
[36:35] getting to
[36:37] maturity to
[36:39] maturity why because they fail to
[36:42] recognize God has something
[36:46] promised amen that promise is his word
[36:51] for you for your life for the bride for
[36:55] the body in this last day and unless we
[36:59] obey
[37:00] that didn't brother say how can you
[37:04] receive the
[37:06] token people don't know brother that the
[37:09] token is connected with
[37:13] adoption because
[37:15] brother amen he said in order to get the
[37:21] token we know what the token is right
[37:24] it's the life of the blood right it's
[37:26] Holy Spirit right that's the Holy Ghost
[37:30] for this
[37:33] age see people are still trying to have
[37:36] a Pentecostal
[37:39] idea amen amen no
[37:42] sir the Holy Ghost in This Hour Amen to
[37:47] be given to a
[37:49] bride because in
[37:51] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy
[37:54] Ghost wasn't in the song
[37:59] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[38:03] hallelujah people understand
[38:05] that that's why brother say and then
[38:09] people take those quotes and they don't
[38:12] know what to do with them because they
[38:14] got a car
[38:16] mind when they read you can have the
[38:19] baptism of the Holy
[38:20] Ghost every day of your life and still
[38:23] be lost they go to hell amen what's he
[38:28] talking about he not talking about the
[38:30] baptism in the
[38:33] soul it's not talking about the spirit
[38:35] of
[38:37] adoption that's not what he's talking
[38:39] about he's talking about the Holy Ghost
[38:42] calling on you on your flesh into your
[38:46] spirit never coming into your
[38:51] soul hallelujah hallelujah and only the
[38:55] Bri rece it in the
[38:58] soul Hallelujah that's the evidence that
[39:02] you
[39:04] are there's no greater
[39:08] evidence
[39:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah said
[39:15] only
[39:16] those with the Holy Ghost will go in
[39:22] the Hallelujah Hallelujah the others
[39:24] that will go in the rapture
[39:26] they had the Holy Ghost for their day
[39:30] and they were sealed until the day of
[39:34] redemption hallelujah hallelujah that's
[39:37] what we got to understand that as an age
[39:40] as a people as a body this is the age of
[39:46] adoption the spirit of adoption is here
[39:49] to fill your
[39:53] soul not the spirit of justification
[39:58] is here to fill your
[40:01] soul oh Spirit of
[40:04] adop because you are
[40:07] Sons you send the spirit of his
[40:10] son into your
[40:12] hearts to cry the
[40:14] father you
[40:16] understand now
[40:18] notice Paul is
[40:21] saying amen we are to put
[40:24] away child
[40:27] things is that
[40:31] right
[40:32] because the childish
[40:35] things
[40:38] amen is
[40:40] showing
[40:42] immaturity it's
[40:45] showing that the true
[40:48] revelation of his
[40:51] will has not been revealed yet to our
[40:54] hearts we can claim all we want
[40:58] brother but the
[41:01] proof is
[41:04] in that seed of
[41:07] God in what stage it
[41:13] is if it's been broken
[41:16] yet or is it still
[41:20] sealed as the holy ghost coming into the
[41:23] soul to Quicken the seed
[41:27] and raise it
[41:29] up you see what I'm
[41:32] saying or is is not saying that you're
[41:35] not a son of
[41:36] God just saying that the seed is down in
[41:40] there and it hasn't been quickened
[41:44] yet amen hallelujah when the seed is
[41:48] quickened it brings to life
[41:52] amen bring the Fulfillment of the word
[41:57] this age full stat of
[42:01] Christ now watch what brother Ram
[42:03] says he says Paul is
[42:07] addressing in Ephesians 1 directly
[42:12] straight to the shoulder to the
[42:16] church that's what we're doing
[42:19] tonight
[42:21] see little
[42:23] babies I got a little one back there
[42:27] that just learned how to
[42:28] walk he he bumped fall
[42:32] down and he thought he was doing
[42:35] something

[42:39] day but now I'm a man and I put away
[42:43] childish
[42:45] things we got to come to full doctr

[42:53] like good old shouting meeting
[42:59] where we can clap our hands and shout
[43:01] and have a good
[43:03] time have a powerful
[43:05] service and things and dance on the
[43:11] bubble amen as it were but
[43:15] wait when The Showdown time
[43:20] comes you don't know where you're
[43:25] standing let's get back and find
[43:29] out what's making us do
[43:32] that let's get back to the
[43:36] foundation
[43:38] amen you believe
[43:40] that
[43:42] am what good would it do
[43:44] brother to have the Holy Ghost to make
[43:49] you do all those
[43:50] things and then you can't face the
[43:54] challenge that the devil is trying to
[43:56] put in your
[43:57] way so you so you won't come to the
[44:02] promise that God is
[44:05] predestined don't you
[44:07] understand that that has to be with
[44:09] every Son of
[44:11] God amen amen that's why David had to
[44:17] encounter
[44:19] goath to come to his
[44:21] position remember that that's why Jesus
[44:26] had to face his
[44:28] Giants the Pharisees of his day amen in
[44:33] order to be tested he had to face the
[44:37] Devil
[44:37] Himself and then he come out
[44:41] Transfiguration is that right that's why
[44:44] the prophet of God in this day had to
[44:47] face the
[44:48] giant of
[44:50] unbelief Amen in the Supernatural power
[44:55] of his ministry

[45:42] overcame
[45:44] that Hallelujah then God was able to
[45:48] lift him up he didn't have to wait till
[45:52] 63 in the
[45:54] 50s he was speaking speaking squirrels
[45:56] into
[45:58] existence why because they had already
[46:03] passed that trial in his
[46:08] lifeu you

[46:29] depressed amen running from
[46:33] Jezebel he was tired and
[46:36] weary but God cared for his

[46:46] tree went out on his of his own
[46:52] province into another
[46:54] province Hallelujah and there he left

[47:06] appointed
[47:08] place it was a juniper tree that was in
[47:12] the ground for that very
[47:15] purpose God laid him down under the
[47:18] tree the juniper tree and put him to
[47:21] sleep so he could rest a little while
[47:24] then he knew he was hungry

[50:12] Joseph did not
[50:13] understand but God had a

[55:49] anytime let this table stand as a
[55:53] witness that's the way is to be
[55:56] done in
[55:59] the amen Amen brother and sister that's
[56:04] that's exactly what Paul was speaking
[56:06] of in First Corinthians
[56:09] 13 and in First Corinthians

[56:27] in understanding be
[56:34] men amen amen questions and answers in
[56:39] 64 he says First Corinthians
[56:42] 13 says when that which is perfect has
[56:45] come that which is in part shall be done
[56:48] away with so all these little
[56:51] things listen to the prophet so all
[56:55] these little
[56:56] things of jumping up and
[56:59] down like a
[57:03] kid trying trying to talk in
[57:07] tongues and all these other things when
[57:11] that which is
[57:12] perfect and we do have
[57:15] today by God's help the perfect
[57:19] interpretation of the word divine
[57:23] vindication am then that which is in
[57:27] part is done away
[57:31] with when I was a child I speak as a
[57:34] child I understood as a
[57:37] child but when I became a
[57:40] man I put away childish
[57:43] things amen amen I go to
[57:46] preaching and then I don't get to these
[57:49] other
[57:52] things amen I know
[57:56] this is
[57:58] what Paul is speaking
[58:00] of not only in the gift
[58:04] realm but in the gifts of every

[59:51] that there's a purpose for the kingdom
[59:54] of God
[59:55] there's a purpose to fulfill the
[59:58] word it ain't about what I feeling how I

[1:06:36] hinder at this time the coming of the

[1:07:55] here in the
[1:07:58] message the flashy red light of his
[1:08:02] coming our lord Jesus was asked this
[1:08:05] question he gave him the sign of his
[1:08:08] coming and immediately he said heavens
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:12] earth pass away but my words shall not
[1:08:15] pass
[1:08:16] away then he said learn a
[1:08:19] parable the F tree putting forth his
[1:08:22] branches you know that summer is nine so
[1:08:25] when you see these things come to pass
[1:08:28] or made manifest know that the time is
[1:08:31] at

[1:08:35] generation shall not be done
[1:08:38] away until all these things shall come
[1:08:41] to
[1:08:42] pass he says what
[1:08:45] generation the
[1:08:47] generation that's
[1:08:49] seeing the
[1:08:52] apostasy huah

[1:21:12] now I've seen it
[1:21:15] friends this Bible laying open here
[1:21:18] before
[1:21:19] me I've seen it happen I know it's
[1:21:24] trth I've seen it myself I'm a witness
[1:21:29] of that word being
[1:21:32] fulfilled to say it and stand there and
[1:21:37] see the
[1:21:39] Creator bring a living
[1:21:42] creature into
[1:21:45] existence right in the presence of your
[1:21:48] eyes you shake your head in
[1:21:51] wonder
[1:21:53] and you look around and see him bring
[1:21:54] another
[1:21:56] one just exactly like
[1:21:58] it because you said
[1:22:02] so you turn over here and say there will
[1:22:05] be another
[1:22:06] one and there it is that's the
[1:22:11] truth there is
[1:22:16] perfect just speak the
[1:22:18] word never saw the
[1:22:20] squirrel did you said this
[1:22:23] scripture speak and don't
[1:22:26] doubt what you say it'll
[1:22:28] be took God at his word I took God by
[1:22:34] his word and it was there that's just as
[1:22:39] powerful and
[1:22:41] friend as your
[1:22:43] pastor that's just as
[1:22:45] powerful as when Joshua stopped the
[1:22:49] sun because the sun was already there
[1:22:53] there the elements was
[1:22:56] moving he stopped the
[1:22:58] movement but this he brought something
[1:23:02] that wasn't there he created and I'm
[1:23:06] glad to be acquainted with the
[1:23:08] god that can take the dust of the earth
[1:23:12] and someday without anything call me
[1:23:16] back to life
[1:23:17] again the same Faith after I have been
[1:23:21] planted in the
[1:23:25] grave you
[1:23:27] say and don't
[1:23:29] doubt but believe what you said you will
[1:23:34] have what you
[1:23:35] said see believe that it will happen
[1:23:40] David in the Psalms spoke of him he took
[1:23:44] his
[1:23:45] power and he minister to
[1:23:48] others not only did he keep it to
[1:23:51] himself but he ministered to others also
[1:23:55] saved others even to the
[1:23:59] uttermost and he can do the same thing
[1:24:02] now promise the same Faith to
[1:24:05] Believers in St John
[1:24:09] 1412 and also in Mark
[1:24:11] 16 and also in Mark
[1:24:16] 1123 for the
[1:24:18] believer
[1:24:20] Hallelujah and he has appeared to
[1:24:24] us in the same form as he did to them in
[1:24:28] the Old
[1:24:29] Testament as he did in the New Testament
[1:24:32] he showed by the same word the same
[1:24:35] Christ and I declare to you that Christ
[1:24:38] is the Holy
[1:24:40] Ghost Christ is the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost he is the anointed
[1:24:47] one just a person see that is Christ
[1:24:53] the anointed one the anointed one there
[1:24:56] would be a man that would be anointed
[1:25:00] anointed by what the Bible said in Acts
[1:25:04] two Jesus of
[1:25:06] nazare a man approved God
[1:25:11] Anointed with the Holy
[1:25:14] Ghost Jesus himself was anointed with
[1:25:19] the Holy
[1:25:20] Ghost and he went about doing great
[1:25:23] works see that was God
[1:25:27] manifested through that he was in this
[1:25:31] man and when we become
[1:25:34] acquainted with that same Spirit we are
[1:25:39] anointed
[1:25:41] messiah messiah of the last
[1:25:44] day to shine for the
[1:25:48] resurrection of Jesus Christ to show he
[1:25:52] is not dead but in the form of the Holy
[1:25:56] Ghost he is in his people he's
[1:26:00] moving among his
[1:26:02] bride with the love
[1:26:06] affair pouring out into her himself they
[1:26:10] are becoming one for the wedding supper
