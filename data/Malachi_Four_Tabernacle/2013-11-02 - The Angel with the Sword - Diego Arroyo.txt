TRANSCRIPT
========================================
want no unbelief inheriting his promise is that right God doesn't want unbelief possessing the things that he has promised his children amen that's why it was only to those who believe it it's a strange thing that if if we read the story in the Book of Numbers chapter one you find God commanding Moses and we preached on this before how that in Numbers chapter 1 verse three you you find and you read that whole first chapter second chapter it's it's uh Moses commanding that the names of all all the Israelites of every tribe from 20 years old and upward to be registered notice the registration or the recording of the names amen being being being written down in this book and it says when the time comes amen this book will be open and the names that are written in the book shall there be an inheritance given and he said that in numbers one that those that were from 20 years and and upward they will go into the land and they would fight is that right amen amen hallelujah I like how God does things because he likes to flip things right around the devil amen because the devil heard those words do you know what he did he focused all his all his attack on that group of people from 20 years old and upward and when the devil heard that amen God allowed him God told the devil okay do all you want with this group of people from 20 years and upward they're yours amen you know what the devil did he gave them unbelief he made them murmur he made them complain he made them caus all this to befall Israel amen and what happened Hallelujah when the time of crossing over came amen God probably asked the devil are you finished you already got all of them you got don't don't don't forget one of them you got all of them now okay all right that's okay because now from 20 we and downward are the ones that are going to cross over Hallelujah 20 years and upward are going to die and perish in the wilderness you see how God did that you see that that's a type in this house amen that God is showing us how he works amen this is in his word amen because in Numbers Chapter 14 he tells he tells them amen all of those from 20 years and upward shall not go into the land what were they going to go into the land for they they were going to go in to possess it to fight for it to fight off the inhabitants amen and possess what God given me and he says only Joshua and Caleb from those from that generation amen will go in but all the rest will not go in Hallelujah am so showing you from 20 years and downward then we're going to cross over to the land but that's how God does things amen he allows the devil many times to hear his plans that's why he said in the seventh seal amen he said I can't say much more about this because if I if I say something else he said the devil will hear it but I must keep it to myself myself I must keep it in my bosom amen and brother said it's still a secret amen so there's part of that seven seal that yet is a secret amen hasn't been spoken hasn't been given the same thing it was concerning that third pool amen so we see that in in these things God allows sometime his enemy to hear sometimes he doesn't allow Amen to hear cuz brother said Satan can do great damage he if he would hear that he'll do great damage and he never heard it and with all that he's still doing great damage true but not like he would have if he would have heard right yes sir notice we see Revelations 10 the angel coming down we gave this the other day at a Bible study but we want to look into this now Amen to C the inspiration of his spirit and that's why brother said many times there's you have to understand there's difference between uh preaching and teaching amen says the same holy spirit that saves the sick that heals the sick but the anointing is different did you know that did you know there's an anointing for for healing there's an anointing for discernment there's an anointing for preaching amen and then there's anointing for teaching that's what brother ra said many times after he would preach he would say now you know what I'm doing he says I'm getting away from the anointing of preaching because I want to get into this other anointing now see Hallelujah he says I have to settle down amen I have to talk he said that's why I'm talking to you amen and then after he would talk then he would he would say now I'm ready amen see and he would begin to call a line and all these things so we see now look here the angel brother mam said that this angel amen of Revelations 101 was the angel of the Covenant I believe that he said it was Christ amen coming down amen clothed In This Cloud and in his hand he had a open book is that right now notice the significance of that book amen the book is not closed the book is open the book is not sealed amen it's open and in Joshua 5 we find when Joshua is ready to take amen the land or the city of Jericho amen this is powerful because this is where you and I come in to this uh revelation of this word because we understand that today there's a great debate amen of what the Joshua commission is amen as one old brother said amen now every day everywhere you look there's a Joshua a Joshua here a Joshua there here Joshua there Joshua everywhere Joshua amen he said but really when we look into the word amen into the scripture and we're talking about not the name Joshua but we're talking about that people are Ministries they they they claim men to be Joshua where the message people would only look into it it would show you different amen if if you would see amen that that brother Bram said one one time Amen in the late 50s he was studying the scripture and afterward brother ROM said there came a Bible that came down from heaven now notice the significance in the vision brother said the Bible came down from heaven as a book came down to us in this age from Heaven Jesus said Hallelujah I am the bread of life that have come down from heaven he that eats of me shall never die is that right and what is that when that book came down in in verse 8 to 11 of chapter 10 that angel tells John eat The Rook amen amen so this book is to be eaten this book amen is the bread of life is that right Hallelujah this book Hallelujah is the word of God but when it comes in the hour which we all know when this Angel the com none other than the Lord Jesus Christ with the rainow over his head coming in power according to his own prophecy of Matthew 24 coming according to Daniel 7 coming according to all these prophecies in the scripture amen that he had prophesied and he comes amen with this open book and when Joshua amen is here and he had been given this commission hallelujah amen to do what to divide the land to divide the inheritance to give to the children of Israel by discernment that's by discernment he was to divide the land because each one of their names had a significance and that significance had to do with what their position was going to be if ephra mean corn Raiser you weren't going to make go over there and have a raised cattle that's not deserving amen you were going to place him in the position according to his name so Joshua had to have discernment understanding revelation of what the names mean that's power Joshua had to understand what the names meant Amen in order to divide the land according to their names Hallelujah am and the same is promised us in this hour brother mam said Ephesus is parallel with Joshua why is it parallel with Joshua because in Joshua is where they had already crossed over into the land and they were being placed every man was being given a measure of that land Hallelujah and brother said Moses was a type of Jesus and he led the people amen all the way up to Jordan he said but Jesus didn't take him over is that right he died he was crucified but when he rose again Joshua commission the Holy Spirit came in and begin to position the people in the New Testament and when it comes Amen to the ministry of Paul being raised up he begins to position the people in the alpha church and brother said amen and the Paradox message 1965 notice Joshua here is a book of redemption Joshua is the book of redemption of the Old Testament did you get that what are we talking about this book that came down from heaven was what it was a book book of redemption that book of redemption seal withal right amen amen amen is that true yes is yes sir what was that book it was the book that had been given unto Adam in the beginning which names of the predestinated seed that were to be manifested upon the Earth what's on that book it's not a literal book it's the mind of God that he wrote your name before the foundation of the world and the lamb was slain in the mind of God and we were slain with him that's what he said in the message serpent seed amen amen notice when this book comes down in Revelations 10 it's open is that right Hallelujah and when Joshua sees this man amen he sees him brother said that that man the pillar of fire that had led the children of Israel who was that Christ said it was Christ the of fire amen amen and if you realize remember when Paul speaks of Moses he would rather forsake Egypt amen MH amen and forsake to be called a son of the sister of pharaoh amen amen is that right and and and he he chose he he chose a reproach of Christ greater riches is that right amen so he was taking the reproach of Christ see brother said that shows you who he was following in the wilderness is that right amen but in Exodus 23 verse 20 it says behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice amen provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but thou sh indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then will I be an enemy to thy enemies and an adversary to thy adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the unto the amorites and the Hittites and the hites and the Canaanites and the hites and the jebusites and I will cut them off Amen brother said that's the angel of the Covenant amen he preached a message obey the voice of the Angel amen amen what was he speaking of he was speaking of the same thing in our day this angel came back down again to do what Amen to bring us into this promised land to bring us into a dividing of inheritance that is within the book of redemption because Joshua it's a book of redemption but Joshua did not open until they crossed the Jordan see because the Joshua commission said in this Vision I saw the book coming down and the book was open this is in brother's Vision amen the Bible comes down but the Bible's not closed see a great hand and a finger begin to read amen chter 1 verse one Amen to verse and if you read that that's the that's the commission of Joshua Hallelujah after Moses I died brother said Moses is the top of the law Moses amen and Joshua existed at the same time time he said but Joshua could not come into full ministry until Moses died now notice brother says hallelujah Redemption is in two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts is to come out of and to go into it takes two parts to make Redemption Moses represented the law and brought them out of Egypt whereas Joshua represented Grace and took them into the promised land law and Grace were two different aspects of God's command this is paradox message 1965 and he says the law brought them out and Moses and and Joshua took them in it's also represented for our day and now it represents that as they were in the journey so have we come out of Egypt chaos and we're on our road to the promised land in my father's house are many manions Hallelujah did you get that amen it's law that brings us to recognize that we're wrong but it's Grace That Forgives usj law has no hope of redemption hallelujah hallelujah it has no Grace in it because law only points to you that you are a sinner but Grace tells you to get out of itall laws of policemen that put you in jail but Redemption is the one who paid the F to bring you out Hallelujah to out of and into Grace the Ephesus we find the same thing in the Old Testament in the Book of Joshua the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua of the Old Testament the book of Ephesians of the old test is the Book of Joshua see it's the same thing it's the position but when Joshua raised up he brought an exodus into the land Hallelujah and we're taught in the Book of Revelation listen that the Seven Seals the book to be sealed up with seven Mysteries amen the Seven Seals that in the last day Revelations 10 we find out that the Le see the last messenger of the last age during the time of his prophecy the Seven Seals would be open the seven Mysteries would be unfolded that had been left out now notice we promised according to Revelations 10 that all these things that the reformers had left out they had taken the church up to a certain point brother says Moses was a type of the denominational ages why he said because the denom ational ages and the churches glorified themselves and brother said Moses glorified himself when God told him speak to the Rock and he didn't speak to it he smoted it amen and brother said The Rock still brought Waters but Moses had to pay the price for disobeying what God told him to do but he showed the people that he could bring the waters see by him hitting the Rocks when all he had to do was just speak to him Amen to show that the power wasn't in him it was in God yes but when he did that brother said he was glorifying himself before the people and you know that was the exact thing that did not let him go into the pro but yet Grace took him into the promise Hallelujah is that right because there he stood in Matthew 17 in the promised land Hallelujah with Moses with Elijah and Jesus Hallelujah so he did come in by grace even even even at that time Hallelujah when the time of his death came which he wrote of his death is that right in the book of jomy and Moses died and no one knows he is buried and Moses was right so he knew his time was coming hallelujah hallelujah but you know what the Bible shows us that during that time Hallelujah that he was going away when he fell upon That Rock Amen amen the Bible shows us amen that Michael the great Archangel came down Amen to take up his body Hallelujah and take him up to the sixth Dimension glory to godu amen he said I got to use this for for future references Hallelujah for future events I got to use this body I need am come on to God yes sir if you ever notice every time everywhere Michael is mentioned it has to do with Resurrection it has to do with bodies the voice of the Archangel Hallelujah and Jesus said in St John 5 now is the time that those that are in the voice those that are in the in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God read it and then he says but the time is coming hallelujah amen that's what he said he said now is the time when those that are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God but the time is coming when all those who are in the grave shall hear the voice of the son of man oh my notice brother and sister what what is these things speaking of when when Moses amen amen was kept away then Joshua was able to raise up to bring the people into the land and what did crossing the Jordan mean what did that mean to us to them it meant amen going in and beginning to fight begin to possess begin to fight and drive away the inhabitant the land amen that's what that meant but to us what does it mean the message Paradox 1961 brother Ram says remember in this Vision I was coming down to Jordan now this is a different Vision now remember I already shared to you the vision for the book open coming down reading from Joshua verse 1 to9 Dowing it to brother and he relates that Vision in the Paradox message 196 he relates it in the 50s also but you'll find it in 1965 it brings up that Vision again when with connection of the opening of the seals that's what we just read to you there an adoption age there cannot be a positioning there cannot be an dividing of inheritance if the Seven Seals don't open you agree brother ra says in order for this Ephesians to come another Ephesians in the last days there has to be seven seas to be open according to Revelations 10 according to Malachi 4 according of St Luke and Ephesians is promised us yes and there must come in this Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded and it is in the Le age see I believe we're in the shadows in the living of the coming of the Son of God and just as Joshua raised up just before the Ephesians raised up so listen to this then he takes it to the middle of the Bible so did John the Baptist raised up so that the next Ephesian could raise up but we promised another Ephesians you see how he did that so over there amen there was there was Moses following the pillar of fire is that right that was the angel of the Covenant amen but remember he had already he already told him obey the voice of the Angel brother said did you did you ever think why God like likes to use the ministry of Elijah so much he said because he always carried out his orders amen he said look at him he never one bit dis obey the orders of God so that's why God likes to use that Ministry five times hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but notice hoses had disobeyed the voice of the Angel is that right and all of these unbelieving people they could not cross over so when Joshua raises up amen they come into the promised land what happens that Pillar of Fire that was above them is no longer there amen amenu now it was easy during the days of Moses to just walk and walk and follow amen they were seeing these things and when the fire would begin to leave they would pack up and follow amen amen is that right but now there no Pillar of Fire amen what happened said the pillar of fire became a man the pillar of fire in human FLH yes and Joshua finds the pillar of human now who was the Joshua commission given to in our day Revelations 2:7 is that right and Revelations 101 is the Angel of the Covenant amen the same one that had led the children of Israel the same one that had Liv through the the church ages as the pillar of fire that's what brother Ram said the Feast of the trumpets he said he lived through the church ages as Pillar of Fire as Son of God hallelujah hallu but he promised to reveal himself Hallelujah in the last days as the son of man so would be the pillar of Fire in human flesh Discerning what did Brother Ram say about that Ministry he said that Ministry is Hebrews 42 and what does the scripture say the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword amen amen why because it is AER of the thoughts and intents of the heart is that right so he took the discernment Hallelujah he took the ministry Elohim in human flesh to Hebrews 4:12 is that right to the sword amen discerning now when Revelations 101 meets with Revelations 107 amen hallelujah he gives him the seven seal mystery Revelation is that right amen he gives up the full Plan of Redemption reveal and when and when Joshua Revelations 107 receives this amen notice there in in Joshua 5 amen verse 14 Joshua worships is that right amen and he and he says say what sayith my Lord unto his servant have you ever read in the book of Acts with the pillar of fire when Paul's telling his testimony the pillar of fire knocks him off his horse and he see this great light and he calls him Lord what were the words that Paul used what will my Lord have me to do amen the same words that Joshua uses here when he meets the P fire a man what will my Lord have me to do am there it is the same characteristics that Moses did in Exodus 3 when he met the pillar fire the burning bush same thing so what is it it's none other than Jesus Christ it's the angel of the coven but notice when that shows up the very next chapter is the conquest of Jero is that rightl but I want you to notice here we're going to read in Joshua chapter 6 anden if we read Joshua chapter 6 read verse 25 and Joshua saved where he had the heart of the life in her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even until this day because she he The Messengers Joshua sent to SP Jero is that right Joshua saved Israel is that right but who gave him that command that commandment was given by the Lord but now notice notice these things when they cross over Jordan there was Kings All in This land and they had all heard herself she had heard that the that the Seas open that the the people vanish before him hallelujah amen that there was no King no Army withand them and the Bible says that there their hearts melted in fears so when we in this hour amen when there's a great crossing over of Jordan brother vam says there's a narrow pathway set in this Vision that was heading towards the Jordan and crossing over the Jordan and on the other side is where all the promises of God laid and then he goes on Amen and then he comes to the prophecy of Danny Henry Henry amen how many have ever thought about that you know the prophecy says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven aits me that listen to what brother says concerning that point right there a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee and he says now that's what I wondered will it be when I die then I happen to think Heaven's not portion off to different portions to us up there Heaven is the kingdom of heaven that's within us that one waits for see wow you hear what he said brother ra is telling you right there what that portion of that prophecy means look at that because of this momentous decision portion of Heaven awaits you now that's what I wondered will it be when I die then I happen to think Heaven's not portion off to different portions to us up there Heaven is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within us and one waits for see now watch then he goes on the tremendous victory in the love divine now you see what coming down to the Jordan meant we're down here now let's cross over Let's cross the other side now this is 1961 cuz it all belongs to us it's all ours the envisions have never failed they can't fail I believe it with all my heart we'll cross Jordan the separation God break to us the seals that's on the back side of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided the people their inheritance that God had left for them the all these things that we're seeing connecting Min of Joshua to the book of redemption to the dividing of The Inheritance amen within the promised land to the positioning of the children of God and to show you amen that these things we going to happen here spiritually the kingdom of God must be established in the heart of man right here see because if not we're thinking about something way off until the Rapture happens it has to happen now brother s these things are to be taken place in our lives when you recognize that a huge portion of heaven was given amen the seventh angel wow he was living amen what was that huge portion of Heaven Oh Glory to God it was a revelation of these Seven Seals it was this revelation of his own life his own Ministry his own the revealing of his own life within the word of God is what place positioned him into the office of a prophet yes sir because before that took place he was not in the office of a prophet amen he was born a prophet brother said a prophet is born a prophet he was Vindicated a prophet he was shown with different signs and wonders of a prophet but he was not in the office of a prophet amen and if you read taking size with Jesus 1962 says I always say I'm not a prophet he says I don't say that because I want to be humble amen amen he says I say that because I'm not in the office of a prophet he said God told me to do the work in of an evangelist and that's what I am a prophet don't evangelize a prophet don't go to churches and preach Doctrine no sir a prophet doesn't go here and preaches and goes over here the churches and try to gather them together brother bam said Prophet comes out of the Wilderness with thus sayth the Lord see and that's why when he was up on Sunset mountain in the wilderness in the desert they had met this Hallelujah Pillar of Fire and it came down with the open book The Sword was not in his sheath it was out of his she when Joshua seen this am man the sword was out of his sheep and when our Joshua seen this one he his book wasn't sealed his book was open Hallelujah yes sir but notice when that time come it put him Amen in the office because in 1965 he said first pool was Divine Healing second pool was Discerning the spirits third pool was the revealing of the word and then he said there's no higher office than a prophet for the revealing of the that's right anoint the ones at the end time Hallelujah so the raling of the seven SE put him in his position Hallelujah of the office of a prophet you believe that say amenu so when he comes into his position and he begins to come in and the Book of Joshua is open the book of the Redemption Hallelujah is open then we begin to see that the time comes hallelujah hallelujah when RAB to be saved let's go to Joshua chapter 2 amen glory to God hallelujah amen look Joshua 2 verse four and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but I was not which they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out and with they went when I but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with with the stocks of fla and she had laid an order upon the roof men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the Forts and as as soon as they they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land amen and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land think because of you for we have heard how the Lord DED up the water of the Red Sea for you and when you came out of Egypt what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan Sion and old whom he utterly destroyed amen so look she is already testifying with her own lips she making a public confession brother says of her faith what these things were taking place in the message perseverance she never brother said she never said well let me see this great Joshua General you guys have let me see if he has curly hair if he's nice and pretty oh then I'll maybe see if I'll join with you guys oh my amen says she heard by faith faith cometh by hearing of what these things were taking place it shows you that inside of her soul there was a predestinated seed and when and when these two spies came in brother Ram tells you and I that that today means that they brought in tapes and played J's message in their house so you have to you have to see these things through eyes of Prophecy amen amen notice now when these things are being said by her amen notice then they give her amen the message to be given amen now Verse 18 behold when we come into the land Thou shalt B this line of scared thread in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father thy mother and thy brother and all thy father's household home unto thee is that right bring all your family under the token amen now notice we in the opening the Seven Seals come it is a time of destruction is a time of judgment upon Jero what is Jero what does it represent Amen brother says Jero message blind 1954 Louisville Kentucky Kentucky Jero always was a wicked city as far as I know it's still a wicked City in the Bible it represents the roads to hell wow did you hear that Jero means what roads to Hell amen Amen brother man said there's doors to hell is that right but there's only one door Amen to Heaven hallah is that right amen and Upon This Rock will I build my church The Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you I said those Gates of Hell are denomination no Presbyterian no Baptist amen no Methodist no Pentecostal Prevail against this Revelation Hallelujah now notice that's why Jericho could not Prevail amen it crumbled down Hallelujah at the sound of seven trumpets Hallelujah at the sound of a seven tunder message at the sound of the message amen of Seven Seals these things have to crumble down to show that RAB and the and the token that Sheed during the opening Hallelujah of these seals now notice the display of the token was not going to be until that time read it in the scripture we read when the time of Destruction comes when we come to destroy that's when you're going to hang the Scarlet line not before is that right can you see that that she wasn't going to hang the token before the the time of Destruction was coming the reason that she was going to hang it is because they were going to come in to destroy the city is that right amen yes so notice it did not the token did not exist until the opening of the 76 the token did not exist hallelujah amen until after the 14 days but now notice then he says in the Bible Jericho represents the roads to Hell Jero sits in the valley Jerusalem sits on a hill remember the Good Samaritan he found a man coming from Jerusalem to Jero when he fell among Thieves think of it he was backsliding coming from Heavenly to the cursed Jero is a cursed City Jerusalem is a bless how many remembers when he preach on the Good Samaritan remember that what was a good Samaritan amen he he was riding the land on a white horse remember the Good Samaritan I guess you don't and in that Ministry of the Good Samaritan he found this man that was backsliding from Jericho from Jerusalem to Jericho he was going downhill amen yes sir remember we said that amen not even knowing that brother R had already said amenu but notice in that descending he had met or he had been robbed by these theves amen you remember what they were they were beating him remember that is a thief and a robber is that right what were they said preachers amen hallelujah that had beat this man on his back sing way down to Jero from the Blessed City to the city oh Hallelujah hu but what did this get Samaritan do glory to God the Bible says that from his side he took out some oil and some wine that's in the scripture that's in the parable of Jesus the Good Samaritan it's not just a kid story it's the Bible amen it's not just a cartoon of the Good Samaritan it's the Bible that shows you Mysteries and in those Mysteries the Bible says that this Good Samaritan Hallelujah that had been riding on a white horse amen glory to God begin to give unto this wounded man that had been beaten through seven Church ages amen cond sending amen from the New Jerusalem down to the cursed city of Jero amen but in that last hour the Good Samaritan appears amen riding the land glory to God and it gives unto him oil and wine glory to God to do what to heal his wounds remember Isaiah in the book of Isaiah the Bible says that that at that day the light of the sun will be as a light of seven days and the light amen of the Moon as the light of the Sun is that right in the day when God Health the womb of his people yes sir in the day with these Revelations come to bring the healing the bom of Gilead why brother and sisters because it was showing us that in this cursed City amen is is is represented as a place a denomination that takes you to hell and notice he says it's also a type of backsliding just expect the enemy to be along the road when you start backsliding that's true Jericho was always a cur City this is thy faith has saved thee Jericho was always a cursed City since the Jews possessed Palestine Joshua said cursed is the man that will build this city again after it been destroyed Jero was represented always represented as a backsliding cursed City amen and Jericho had heard what God was doing but they didn't want to take the warning and there's not a denomination in this country or around the world but what's heard what God is doing in our mid but they don't want to take the warning see brother didn't leave it over there he brought it to president int Amen to show you where Jericho was to show you that Jericho is a system of denomination A system that is cursed A system that that leads you to hell right no matter how much they preach Christ to you in the cross they still lead you to Hell amen yes sir but what this what this Angel come to do is to give Joshua amen the instructions on how to destroy this system Hallelujah and when this angel came down he put one foot on the land and one on the sea why because Revelation 17 says that a beast comes from the water and Revelations 13 says that a beast comes from the Earth but this angel came down put one foot on the land and what on the sea to bind these systems to do what in order to release amen and for to apply the jok in the hour of judgment amen when seven tunders under their voices when seven trumpets are sounding amen glory to God Seven voices Hing out amen through one man at the P of Tabernacle Shing the system of Jero through the revelation of Seven Seals amen the show us said that's why I've always been against denomination I did not know until now that's what he said amen M but now notice they had heard denominations is heard they don't want to take a warning they must have believed that their own big denomination of Jericho is able to resist the wrath of God see what happened now they were shut up no Revival is going to happen here our denomination it won't sponsor such stuff will not have that kind of nonsense Among Us I forbid any of you to go to that meeting wow see who was saying that Jero wow amen M but notice what happened when this Angel comes down with the open book men he gives it unto Joshua yes in the message standing in the Gap he says in Canyon that morning praying and wondering what would happen holding my hands out to God a sword dropped in my hand with a pearl handle Pearl and it's guard over it and a long bleed about three foot long and glistening like hot metal it was like Chrome or it was razor Shar and a voice spoke that shook the Canon said this is the sword of the Lord this is the sword of the Lord for the word of God is sharp you need two and what is the attraction on the mountain he says when it came and dropped him into my hand I Heard a Voice that said that's to King sword I said a king he kns a man with a sword he said The Voice come back and said not a king sword but the king sword the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third pool it's only the third pool it's the Vindication of your ministry see hallelujah it's the Vindication of your ministry see the sword falling the hand the book coming from the angel to preach and reveal the Seven Seals what was brother Ram third pool is that right amen hallelujah and brother Ram says that that sword had three parts to it amen amen and he says that in that three parts he said one was revealed yesterday one today and another is in an unknown tongue amen hallelujah he says in the seven seal in Sao Canyon he said there's a third pool there's the three things that goes with it one unfolded today one yesterday see and the other one I cannot interpret because it's an unknown language yes yes right but yet it is a secret but when this when this shows here amen that the revealing of of these things have given us the application of the token which never existed in any other age not even in the Pentecostal age amen people Miss what the token really is amen see but notice when you begin to see that the sword of God is connected with Redemption but is also connected with judgment when that sword was out of his sheath in the days of Joshua it was showing two things Redemption and the opening of the book forab amen and Jud for Jero brother tells us of different scenes and the Bible does too if we go through these things amen amen some of these things you won't find in the Bible you just have to believe the prophet that's right yes sir amen amen he begins to tell us every time this Angel appears with his sword drawn or when he draws his sword there's Deliverance there's judgment amen and there's Redemption Hallelujah this is powerful because this is what has happened in our day and if you look at these different scenes all of those scenes in the Bible together are taking place today and the people who receive Mercy the grace of God the Redemption of God in those scenes were only a a a type of this antitype of this last being of the bride of Christ amen amen hallelujah and the ones who before that angel in front of that angel amen with that sword drawn not able to see what it is it's it's also a type of the church in our day that is blinded brother ra says in the teaching of Moses that amram Moses his father had gone into much prayer he had cried amen for the Deliverance of Israel and he said he would come home from work late and and tired after working all those hours but yet he would go up to the the attic part of the home amen and he would begin to pray and cry out to God and one and one time he prayed until he fall on the floor he couldn't go any farther he took a little nap and he woke up what's the matter he begin to see a light coming and look look in there in the corner there stood an angel with his sword hanging on his side and he rubbed his eyes he he pulled up on his knees he said Lord what do you want for me and he said am I am the angel of God I have been sent now notice I have come to you that he is going to send a deliver to tell you that these things will come to pass he remembers all of his promises I see the angel now says I look at him he's pulling out his sword and he point it to the North and am looks and he said just point his sword it lays towards the promised land now the angel points the sword he takes it out of the sheep and he points it towards the north towards the promise showing amen that when that angel with the with the sword come when it when it comes open in the promised land Hallelujah Not only was it going to be the Deliverance it was going to be so that you people will inherit that land I promised this is what the angel is telling am I promised Abraham Isaac and Jacob your fathers that you people would inherit this land and that's what this mean did you catch it what is it what did it mean brother he is there the angel but when abam sees him the sword is in a sheath Hallelujah but then all of a sudden when he takes it out he he he does something with it he points towards the north Hallelujah showing where the promised land Le and showing that there they would inherit the land that's what that meant hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and notice man says that's what that means so when we come to the promised land and that angel or that man is there with a drawn sword amen it was the time for that for that promise to be fulfilled not only did he bring Israel out of Egypt but it was time for The Inheritance amen hallelujah hallelujah it was time for The Inheritance Amen to be divided yes and we'll get into that just here in a few minutes show us the father suffices us 1950 brother says this Angel he's speaking of this Angel is All Through the Bible and always appears with a great sword wow hallelujah it's always the same one and he says the big sword was pulled amen David seen him you believe that amen hallelujah you believe that David seen David seen that angel let's go to First Chon 21 amen 1 Chronicles 21 verse this is when David amen listen to the devil amen he provoked David is that right do senses remember that amen and the Lord wasn't pleased with that is that right but what I like about God is that he gave David three choices to choose from amen he said what do you want you want the enemy to to take control of you amen you want three years of famine amen or or you want to be in my hands I'll you and they said I want in your hands if I let you put me in the hands of my enemy he say they're not like you you have mercy they don't amen so so David made the right choice amen after making some wrong choices he made some right and verse 15 and God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it and he was destroying and the Lord beheld and He repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor and they up his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord stand between the Earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem then David and the Elders of Israel who were clothed in s cloud fell upon their faces a type of Christ amen in the time of judgment this Angel Hallelujah bringing judgment to Jerusalem what is Jerusalem what is the New Jerusalem is the bride of Christ and because of these things amen we're going to be fall upon Jerusalem the judgments of God through this angel with a sword drawn amen he's he he is between the Earth and Heaven but the intercession the elders amen begin to come in is that right now notice verse 27 you can read the story if You' like and you have a chance see verse 27 and the Lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the Sheep thereof see because when the sword is out of the sheath it's judgment amen God ain't going to take the sword out just because to take it out he's not a bluff amen and that's why when he's when he appears in Revelations 10 said notice he's roaring like a lion he said the lion does not Roar until he has his prey right in front of him that's when he Roars amen and and it's the same thing with this because he has an open book he has a drawn Sword and the angel doesn't draw his sword just because he draws his sword because it's a time of judgment Hallelujah but in the time of judgment he shows Mercy amto David's lineage ameny to God so brother says David seen him with a big sword you believe that Joshua seen him crossed over Jordan there was a c of the Lord's host amen bam seen him see so he's naming all these people that see the same angel with the same characteristics amen wow B in Numbers 22 amen hallelujah amen yeah verse 22 and God's anger was kindled and because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way of adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and they asked saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way amen and sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and B smoked the ass to turn her into the way but the angel of the Lord stood in the path of The Vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side and when the saw that the angel of the Lord she thrust herself onto the wall and crushed B's foot against the wall and he SM her again and the angel of the Lord stood F went further and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and what happens see bam keeps on hitting amen beating DK see and and when when you when you realize what what what takes place his eyes were veiled his eyes are veiled see God comes down and makes this and makes it this donkey speak amen is that right amen and look at verse uh verse 28 and the Lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said what have I done unto thee that thou has smitten me these three times and said unto the unto the ass because thou has mocked me I would there were a sword in my hand for thou now would I kill thee but see he didn't realize that an angel in front of him had a sword to kill him is that right and he wanted a sword to kill a donkey but yet he's having a conversation with the donkey and he's not realizing I'm talking to a donkey that's what brother saying he was so mad he didn't even know that he was talking to a donkey you know that happens sometimes when you get so mad you do things and eat too you know things like that you going to do things like that when you're bad right not realizing that's true
