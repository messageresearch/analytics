Bri is getting ready with her garments for that glorious to come and take his bride away we see the condition of the White House I've always say if George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were alive and they see what the White House is doing they would die a second time this this this country was made by the Constitution by this Bible where are all those principles they moved them aside so they have to pay for the blood of those that have given their lives for this word I want to thank God for being so I ask your your prayers for your your host I feel like going up to Riv open up the message Church the Lord's will and finish my course I don't know when I come faithful servant for much or less there's many churches [Music] churches Jehovah Witness Pentecostals apostolics there's none of the message so I want to go over there and open PR for me they're going to help me to open up your pray God bless [Applause] you amen God bless her [Music] brother amen we certainly believe that God uh does have a purpose in his life because like he said doctor said two two heart attacks but 14 amen that's a that's certainly a miracle of God Amen and our brother uh testify to the glory of God that we may see that if God has a purpose in your life brother brother Ram said if God has not finished with you amen it's not your time to go there's a mystery of the will of God for your life and that's the mystery of his will amen and we believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord Our Lives what we go through amen is all in God's plan to bring us to that place where we can be like him reflect that image of his word in US amen and as our brother mentioned he has that burden on his heart and whatever we can do Amen to assist him and be of a help uh we are willing to do that amen and uh we believe that uh our brother from what I've heard and known uh he was back in in the days a man serving God and uh he was the the one that spoke to brother the brother that is in Mesa Church oh with our brother Bob uh and uh many many brothers that he come in contact with and spoke of the message too amen if God has put that on his heart amen maybe the Lord will open a way

God let us stand tonight amen brother bham said battle scarred veterans amen we'll get to the other side amen deep [Music] wounds in this battle amen but it was all worth it the Bible says in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 of whom the world was not worthy hallelujah hallelujah of whom the world was not worthy Amen in this hour there is a people in the land whom the world is not worthy of hallelujah we're pilgrims and strangers and we know in whom we have believed in we know where we're coming from we know what purpose we're here on Earth for and we know that soon we'll be caught away amen as our brother said this is time of preparation amen so God bless you tonight let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for a testimony of our brother Lord his faith oh god father in this message Lord and how many many years ago that you revealed it to him and he came out of Thee the the denominational system the apostolic church and father to come to the faith the light of the of this age to walk in the L as you are in the line and father we we appreciate his faith oh God and His conviction to know that God is has still something in his life something Lord that you want to finish and accomplish and achieve in his life oh God that he would go home father after he you have accomplished that in him and if you T oh God if he is to be one as Simeon to stay here oh God and that his eyes may behold the literal coming of Jesus Christ father may you hold them to that time to be one of those that are alive at that time of transforming our bodies we pray for your perfect in his life father and for each one here present we thank you Lord because we know father that you have a purpose predestinated in every one of our lives father through trials through Temptations through fiery trials oh god oh Father May that word of the character of Jesus Christ be formed in every life because character is not a gift it's a victory that is received after having gone through the trial through the test and with faith have overcome the trial oh God that is character and father we pray that that character which Isaac is looking for in Rebecca oh that elaser knew what to look for we pray in this hour God that when that seventh angel presents us to Jesus Christ present a bride with the character of Jesus Christ we thank you for that father we pray for your word tonight that you would Quicken it that you would make it alive every heart Father Make It Real God penetrating to the depths of the Soul father your word is a discerner it's quick and Powerful let it go forth tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost bringing father your children in every soul presence conscience of what is taking place and what you want to achieve in our lives we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you let us take our Bibles The Book of Ezekiel chapter 36 blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen I don't even know if I'm going to be able to get to chapter 37 maybe not amen cuz I don't want to get you too tired but we want to pick up here well we left Ezekiel 30 36 ver 24 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land and then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them you shall dwell in the land that I gave your fathers and you shall be my people I will be your God Amen God bless you may take your seat hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory amen amen as we said this morning chapter 36 and 37 Ezekiel is in the same vision the chapters are just put there by the ones that formed the Bible but originally it is One Vision in itself and we know that one Vision can have more more than one part to it as brother bram's Visions many of them like the third pool Vision it had different parts and it was one vision and in this vision of Ezekiel he is in one Vision that is speaking of the same thing but is is giving him different parts to the Vision in this Ezekiel 36 as we seen this morning what he was prophesying of then when we go to chapter 37 we find that he finds himself in the valley of dry bones and then there is a process of restoration to bring them to their original condition and then in verse 11 he he is explaining the vision God explains to him the vision then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel all they are the bones are dead and our hope is lost and we are cut off from our parts see it's it's in connection with chapter 36 this is what I want to point out therefore prophesy and say unto them thus say the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel so you see see that in chapter 36 he said I will bring you out of the lands of the heathens into your own land amen amen chapter 37 he's saying the same thing amen but he's given it in another symbol that they were like dry bones in Graves amen amen and God is going to bring a resurrection power to bring them out of the graves and make a mighty marching Army to bring them back to their land Israel amen now watch verse 13 and you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you out out of your Graves did you verse did you notice in verse 12 he said he was going to bring them out of of the the graves and bring them into the land of Israel brother said Redemption is in two parts is to bring you out and to bring you into amen amen and then he says in verse 14 and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it say the Lord you see how it's in connection with chapter 36 because he says in chapter 36 I'll bring you out of the out of the lands of the heathens out of all the countries and I will sprinkle clean water which is the word prophecy amen amen and they will be clean and that give you a new heart a new spirit and I will put my spirit in you it's the same it's the same vision but this symbols amen how many know that the Bible is full of symbols and the Book of Revelations reveals the symbols Revelation book of symbols amen it is being given by an Angel the interpretations of the symbols glory to God and that is the angel that we have received the seventh one now notice brother Bram in speaking of of this scripture Ezekiel 36 verse 26 he says this and this is where we want to pick it up everybody say praise the Lord amen amen want to make sure that that that we know amen that this word cannot fail and if whatever need you might have whatever situation it might be be assured that this word can can bring to pass and fulfill anything that you have need of and as the word is going forth no matter what it is the word has power now he says in Ezekiel 36 uh verse 26 brother ROM says watch the Bible he says he will take the old Stony heart away and give you a heart of Flesh then I'll give you a new spirit and put my spirit in you now his spirit is different from your new spirit how many people gets the new spirit and they think they get the Holy Spirit they get feeling happy they jump around maybe do a few things religiously and they think that they got the Holy Spirit oh no the holy spirit makes you act different the holy spirit makes you think different the Holy Spirit was put right in the middle of your new spirit and your new spirit was put right in the middle of your new heart and the new heart and the new spirit in the middle of the new heart now God sits right in the middle now watch brother Bram is showing us amen these different things how it's coming together in the birth in a restoration as he is transforming the Bride of Christ in this hour that has been called out of denominations because in denominations you won't get this transformation amen am no sir how many know that the foolish virgin is not on the outside amen they heard the voice the cry at midnight they can't even be virgins except they're in the word outside of the message it's hard Lots not virgins glory to God brother that's the thing in this hour you must realize how close the thing is amen amen now notice he says that when he bring BRS you out of those systems like he he he he brought Israel out of the Nations what systems was holding the Jews amen amen first of all brother Bram said they were scattered according to the Prophecies of the prophets amen of the Bible amen amen but he promised through eel through all these prophets Zarah Daniel that he was going to bring them back Daniel 12 says after the dispersing of the Jews of the people is ended I'll make known the mystery that Daniel was told to seal up hallelujah hallelujah Daniel heard the Thunders he heard the mystery but God told Daniel seal up the book until the time of the end until the scattering of the people has ended they have been brought back to their land they all make known the mystery that's why when that took place in 46 the angel of God commissioned the Prophet because he was the one that was going to reveal the mystery that was sealed hallelujah amen to God come out of the system what was holding the Jews Hitler Stalin musini dictators dict the Bible calls them kings that have not received a kingdom are not been crowned as a king brother Adam said they're not presidents they're dictators dict amen oh my and those systems was binding the Jews amen amen they begin to deceive them little by little take away their rights take away amen their rights to bear arms yes sir begin to take away little by little amen very subtle and at the same time constructing concentration camps and taking away their rights little by little a squeeze begin to come down more and more and more until the time comes that they said kill them all ain't that the same Spirits against the bride don't you see around us taking place andin they're taking away our rights oh brother soon they'll close these doors soon amen that image will receive its breath the order will go forth kill all of this bride amen oh brother but in this hour those systems they they began to kill them with Hunger amen amen see how many know that when Saul was going was going against the army of the Philistines with Goliath his Champion amen amen the Bible says that Saul gave them no bread yes amen how is he his own son Jonathan wasn't he wasn't aware of that and he said how is the army of Israel going to fight without eating see brother Satan's tactic we know it by the scriptures know it by the message is to take the bread away from the people amen amen don't read message books don't listen to the message don't don't get into the message don't you don't have to study six SEALS or Seven Seals you don't need to know all that you just live a Sanctified life it's a lie of Hell brother and sister this is systems holding the people but God's power amen was to let them loose and bring them on Eagles Wings Hallelujah Hallelujah to the Homeland is that right amen then we realize that in that hour they they seen amen the Fig Tree putting forth its bug they were coming back God doing Supernatural things in the land of Palestine yes sir am amen amen backing up his people backing up his word backing up his prophecy Amen to bring the P what he prophesied through Ezekiel through Daniel through Zachariah yes sir he was going to bring them back from the Nations and he did it he did it amen amen and he also promised amen I will restore sayth the Lord amen I'll bring my bride out of denominations out of the Baptist out of the Methodist out of the Catholic out of the world Hallelujah come out of her my people and be not partakers of his plag I will cleanse you with clean water hallelujah hallelujah I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and I will put my spirit in you don't worry brother sister you say brother I I I don't know if I have a spirit yet if you are his elected he will finish the work amen amen if he gives you a new heart he'll give you a new new spirit and if he gives you a new spirit expect his Spirit to fill you hallelujah hallelujah he will fill you with his spirit because he brought you out brother bam said it's the holy spirit that leads you to the word it's the holy spirit that brought you to the message it's the holy spirit that revealed to you who the Christ who the Christ is hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and in this hour brother he tells us that this new spirit is one and his spirit is another now watch he says don't be deceived by signs and evidences there's all kinds of signs but let's come back to the Bible signs because there were come false prophets preachers that would rise up and do such signs it would deceive the very elect if it was possible now I give you a new spirit I'll put my spirit this isn't a message why is it that is that so many Christians find it hard to live a Christian Life that's a long title huh why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian Life paragraph 31 he says I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit Spirit the new heart is put right in the middle of you and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart and his spirit is put right in the middle of the new spirit it's like a mainspring brother bam is talking about a a clock amen not digital of course but the old clocks amen they're made out of many wheels is that right and they have different Springs amen amen and they all have different uh what you I say uh amen yeah granes where where they where they all come together you you know what I'm saying amen amen and they have to move together now brother bam says that the main spring that's what it's called main spring is a part of a clock it also has another part that is called a half wheel there's also another one called a minute wheel there's also another one called second wheel amen amen so there's one for the second there's one for the minute see they all working together and they all have to work together inside the clock amen there's another part called spiral amen amen there's another part called the rotor see all of these parts are inside of the watch now watch what brother Bram says here he said says now he says the the new heart the new spirit amen then he'll put his spirit in it amen amen then he says it's like a main spring in a famous watch when that mainspring sets in the middle of the watch it controls every movement of that watch and that's what's the matter friends now I hope you see this I'm not saying it to try to twist or be different I'm only saying it because I know that someday I'll Stand in the Judgment with you if the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit that watch spring makes all the rest of the movements to take exactly to the place amen amen keeping perfect time brother what is he telling us that if that Holy Spirit if it's inside of you you'll know the time you'll know the you'll know the prophecy for this Hallelujah somebody says oh brother I got the Holy Ghost amen amen what's the evidence that you got it because you spoke in tongues because you jumped because you did some kind of emotion brother bam tells us what the evidence is Amen brother amen now watch this because we're we're we're still in Ezekiel 36 but now brother Bram is bringing this Vision to us why because Ezekiel Saw this Vision glory to God what Vision the vision where God was going to make his clock to function right because he had tried to get this clock to work for a long time amen amen hallelujah but he he they they couldn't give the right time amen they couldn't give the right time amen amen but he the the master Watchman amen he knows all the parts he knows how to put it together amen am he knows what function each thing has he says this I'm saying this because if the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit that watch spring makes all the rest of the movements take exactly to the place keeping perfect time when the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit listen to this it makes every action of the holy spirit in you take off J exactly according to God's time piece the Bible amen hallelujah according to God's time piece the Bible he says right watch the order of the scripture I will take away the Stony heart give you a new a new heart and the Heart Is The Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit and I will give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order how many people get mixed up they got and they think they got the Holy Ghost but when they only got a new spirit I'll give you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit but there is a new spirit that God gave you so that you could get along with the Holy Ghost because with the old Spirit you could get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along even with your own self so he has to give you a new spirit so that you can get along with God and God gives you a new spirit many times under enthusiasm if you'll Watch The Life I hope I'm not hurting but I hope I'm uncovering a lot of times you think that you have the Holy Ghost oh you said I sung I spoke in tongues certainly being that close to it you might do all of that but it is isn't the holy spirit yet the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ and he taken what did he do he give you a new heart he give you a new spirit that he puts his spirit in you you don't have to go around and pretend that you're a Christian the new spirit brings new life and the Holy Spirit in your new spirit in your heart see and the Holy Spirit goes to the center of it he says here in another message what does it take to make a Christian Life it's like a main spring in a famous watch is self winding all right it sets right in the middle of the new spirit the main spring of a famous watch sits in the middle of the watch and it makes every organ of that watch every little instrument to tick perfectly on time it's all done by the mainspring and the little works on the see of the mainspring it is the will in the middle of the wheel as Ezekiel said amen hallelujah let's go to Ezekiel 1 verse 14 and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flashy of a flash of lightning ezel 114 now as I beheld the living creatures behold one will upon the Earth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of breal and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel amen amen now watch what brother Bram says that what Ezekiel Saw in Ezekiel 1 what was that the vision of our day after the church remember Revelation 4 come up hither he sees the vision he sees the glory of God he sees the throne he sees Lightnings he sees the four living creatures and he sees a wheel in the middle of a wheel glory to God hallelujah watch this the same vision he's seen in Ezekiel 36 I'll give you a new heart a new spirit I'll put my spirit in you when when in the church ages brother when when I bring you out of denominations when I cleans you with water when I cleanse you of your Idols when I bring you to my word I will restore say it to Lord hallelujah I'll bring you back to the faith of the fathers amen amen I'll bring you back to the land by the uttering amen amen of the seven Thunders is that right seven Thunders utter their voices and brother Bram says it is those seven Thunders that literally inside of the heart something is it's literally taking place it's not spiritual it's not all I think that's how it is there is something literally happening something is taking place inside of the Soul inside of your spirit inside of your mind is being transformed you're getting a new mind a new spirit a new heart and he is putting his spirit inside of yours Hallelujah why because the seven Thunders will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father when when he comes to open the seven seal and utter seven voices and what is this Revelations apocalypsis re Revelations amen amen watch this in the message humble thyself 1963 brother bam says this is after brother L preached in the brandom Tabernacle he preached Mark 16 brother Bram comes up to the pulpit amen amen and says I was thinking here one little illustration to back up what he said now look at this watch Hallelujah to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating with one with the other you'll never know the correct time is that right amen and that takes all of us together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for these things brother sister now he's connecting this watch and these pieces in the watch coordinating together with the third pool why because the opening of the word had already come amen amen this is after the opening of the seals he knows first pool Divine Healing second pool Discerning the spirits third pool opening of the word the Seven Seals and that opening of the word is going to do great things for for God hallelujah but it takes coordination it takes the wheel in the middle of the wheel how many know that brother Bram connected the seven seal with the seven Thunders and he connected the third pool right in there he said the angel told me years ago amen amen I will meet you in there that will be your third pool and brother Bram said and in Sabino Canyon when the sword fell in my hand the boy from the inside said this is the third pool glory to God amen amen and we realize brother that is doing great things for the bride of Christ because the watch the main spring has to be on the inside he's got to give you a new spirit a new heart put his spirit inside and when his spirit is in there that's that clock giv perfect time hallelujah hallelujah knows the prophecy knows the prophecy knows what hour we're living in amen amen not walking in darkness oh brother I just believe the message that's all I need to do yes but what did the message come to do what is it doing in your life amen amen is it making you tick right on time hallelujah hallelujah or is it still a little bit behind time it's not Pacific time it's not Eastern Time amen am amen it's not the time of Israel it's not the time of Europe amen amen two hours ahead three hours behind this is God's time God is on time amen amen God's God's Eternal clock amen is always on perfect time his prophecies his word his his thoughts are coming to pass according to that clock glory to God in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says not knowing of course but being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God Knows It But if you'll turn around he said and you look at the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the second pool has ended Hallelujah now again he the prophet is pointing to the clock and he's saying look at it's 2:00 the third the second pool has ended the third pool is on is at hand see we watch for the Bible oh brother sister why does it have to do with the watch Wheel in the middle of the wheel giving the exact time inside of him see it's happening in hereu but he is taking that clock as a symbol in here amen his ministry had changed from the second to the third in here the wheel in the middle of the wheel amen it was time now for third pool you understand it's happening in here but when he looks at the watch Spirit tells him look at that second pulls in end third pool is at hand why because the third pool is not out here it's not over there it's not way over there it's on the inside Hallelujah and in the message humble thyself brother bam says I feel it oh how can I overcome amen amen how can I overcome he says I feel it moving within amen amen I feel the third pool moving on the inside that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel moving to give the exact time Glory he says look at the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of the second pool the third pool is in hand in the message events made clear by prophecy he says we watch the Bible God doesn't leave us in darkness he sent the Bible to for tell us the events before they happened and nature and time would come it's something like looking on a calendar to see what date it is if you if if you say this is Saturday or Sunday what is it look at the calendar the calendar will tell you what day it is when when you see the action of the people maybe going to church maybe you hear the bells ringing you wonder what day it is look on the calendar it'll tell you what day it is and when you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of Sodom you see what time it is the God of this evil age and then seeing a little minority group gathered under the inspiration of producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that is what's supposed to happen then you know what hour we're living in amen hallelujah he says again in modern events made clear by prophecy San berardo Berard the Bible is a book of Prophecy it tells what time we're living in what kind of events ought to take place exactly to the letter for tells it it has never missed one age not one time has it ever missed it is perfect all the time and only those who are predestinated to see it will see it they AB they and they was absolutely contrary to God's will there was a prophet in the land amen trying to do God a service without being his will he didn't know the time amen amen see it wasn't thinking right he was doing the Motions he he was doing everything you did you know that that's not what God was against amen a lot of people in the message misinterpret that amen the dancing wasn't wrong in David's trying to do God a service that wasn't the part that was wrong amen the instruments and the playing and the worship all of that was okay but what was wrong is that he did not consult the prophet amen that was trying to do God a service without being his will and in this hour there's a lot of churches there's a lot of ministers there's a lot of Ley not Consulting the prophet amen and they're trying to serve God they're trying to serve God but they're not giving the exact time the the wheels are they're crashing together it's not working but when the wheel is in the middle of the wheel and his spirit is in you brother you will consult the prophet you go to the message and it will be it will begin to move all the pieces working together giving the right time Glory then you'll know what time we're in what hour it is what I have to do amen glory to God glor hallelujah is that right brother bam says here for the newcomers this is the message voice of the sign for the newcomers this week we have tried to show that God from the beginning know the end that makes him infinite and if he isn't infinite then he isn't God he's got to be omnipotent omes omn omnipotent to be God that's all power knows all things if he doesn't then he isn't God so with him there's nothing really out of cater it's us nothing in God's word it's ticking just like a clock amen amen exactly his word it's ticking like a clock brother bradam said the last day of Jesus life on Earth in less than 24 hours thousands of prophecies were fulfilled and people hallelu hallelujah my hey they don't know the time they don't know the hour trying to worship God in the temple and their Ministry their men of their Church crucifying the Lord over on Calvary brother bam said is repeated again IND di this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ they have crucified him from [Music] pits crucifying the word crucifying the word the message of the hour brother that's what it is in this hour didn't they say in the days of Jesus the disciples came to Jesus and said all the scribes say that Elias must first come even they missed the time because they because they didn't have the main spring inside hallelujah hallelujah they received it later amen and then it was right on time Peter said this is that that was prophesied by the prophet Joel brother that clock was on time glory to God but before that they said the scribes say that Elias must first come he says it right it passed right by them scribes ministers and his own disciples and that it was John the Baptist he already come and they didn't recognize him it behooves us to recognize the hour that we're living in the time that we're living in amen amen the wheel in the middle of the wheel is that ezekiel's vision is that what he saw he saw a people just with the new spirit just with a new heart without the main spring and those kind of people they're good people they're sanctified people they love the lord they're virgins but they don't know the time they don't know nothing about the clock brother they don't know nothing about the hour amen amen but this is the hour of a CR prophetic class of people that knows exactly what time it is in God's time they know their position they know that we're in between amen of Elijah a gentile Prophet a gentile prophet and two Jewish Prophet we're right in the middle amen am they know where they're at in the scripture they know the time amen this is the hour to prophesy again to be an echo of the voice of God in this hour because the bride will be the final voice to the final age she knows her commission she knows this is the time and watch what brother Bram said he said the time will come like they said about about John we thought Elias was supposed to come he already come and you knew it not brother bam said in the message door within the door 1965 he said the hour will come when they will say wasn't there supposed to be a bride and the coming of a Perfect Bride she already come and you knew it not glory to God Amen because they don't know the time the hour that we're living in but when you get the main spring when you get the wheel in the middle of the wheel amen it's Ching when it's time to change the minute and time to change the hour even the second you know when to move glory to God Amen the third pool is doing great things for God according to the prophet now watch oh my how many love the Lord so we when we look at this now what are we seeing amen I I want to close right here because I know if I get into the dry bones but will be here midnight that's okay glory to God glor but how many understand wow how many understand amen hallelujah that another book of Acts is being written again we have been brought back to the land of our fathers to

prophecy you shall rejoice you shall praise the name of the Lord your God amen amen that's restoration brother see because under the systems you didn't have [Music] plenty under the systems you couldn't rejoice and praise the Lord your God amen amen under the systems brother you're bound with no food in a concentration camp and all it is it comes to the point that they eat one another it is that brother eats this brother that brother eats that brother and they all eat one another is that what happened in concentration camps that's what's happening in the city systems of the churches in this hour but God wants us to be full of Honey Hallelujah brotherly kindness brotherly kindness Amen to retain the word you need honey glory to God glor Amen not eat one another love one another Hallelujah is that right oh but he did it again 70 Time s Hallelujah and then he and then he still asks and after 70 right Peter asked him what about after the 70 one day huh not a week one day what what about after the 70 another 70 time 7 Hallelujah and you hear that little spirit all the time all the time you hear it's okay you know one time two times but no that's too that's too much that's too much says who says who is too much says who is too much the word of God tells us it's not too much amen amen this hour brother we must realize we got to keep the world away we got to know what what time it is brother bam said you want to know what time it is you look at the clock you look at the calendar he says but when you want to know what time it is look at the character of the church amen amen the beauty of the church is not in the building God in Simplicity he said it's in the character of the people you can have a beautiful building and a real ugly monstrous character mon amen hallelujah the beauty of the Lord Psalm says beauty comes out of Zion glory to God Amen this is character of Jesus Christ now watch oh God help us how many understand that how many understand that he
