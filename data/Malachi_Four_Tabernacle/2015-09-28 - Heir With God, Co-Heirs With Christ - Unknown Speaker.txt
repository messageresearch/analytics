========================================
The Book of Romans amen blessed be the name Lord is the good amen blessed be the name of the Lord Romans r amen hallelujah we're going to begin reading at the 14th verse Romans amen amen and the word of God reads th for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God remember Jesus said in St John 1613 the spirit of Truth truth will lead you with all truth and when he the comforter is come he will guide you we're by the holy spirit said we're led by the word the holy spirit is not something different the word the Holy Spirit wrote the word spirit is the word in spirit form Jesus said my word is spirit and it is amen that's why brother told us if we have the Holy Ghost in us that Holy Ghost cannot deny one word that's in his word he wrote the word many times brother had to correct the because they were used to only being led by what they felt as to say I feel the anointing of God and the ano of God tell me to do this and brother said that's okay that's fine but always check what you are feeling to do if it's in the word because if it ain't and it's contrary to the word then I don't care what you feel I don't care what you do it's not the holy spirit amen that's why it's the word that's above all other things that's the only thing that Satan can and he says in verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against to fear we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we C in second Timothy 17 that we have received a spirit of power and of a sound mind hallelujah amen that's the spirit of adoption A sound mind a mind that's not contaminated with all kinds of ideas but it's a sound mind with the verse 16 he say the spirit self bear witness with spirit that we are the children of God and and if children thenes this what we want to speak on today HS of God and with Christ everybody say that with me today of God of God and Joints with Christ amen how many believe that this morning Hallelujah if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be also glorified am father we thank you Lord God this for the precious reading of your word father help us God need Lord your Holy Spirit to give us Lord Revelation BL cannot reveal but it takes that Supernatural INSP to give us Lord the [Music] context of this word that is eternal life father mothers way today it each one the portion that is needed in each Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Jus Christ amen you may be seated he of God and join HS with Christ tell with me to the book of St Mark 12 happy St Mark 12 we're going to begin reading from verse one and he began to speak unto them by para now this is Jesus at the end of his ministry he is about to go to the Cross he has come to Jerusalem for the last passover he has come to the end of his time in a human body on and for his last time he has come to City of Jerusalem because here is where they he knows he told his dis that they were to take him he was going to be taken to the Man Hands of sinful men he was going to be offered up for a sacrifice for is that right and we see that he begines to speak this Parable and there's many that are hearing him and this is the reason why he is giving the bar remember that every time that Jesus would speak a parable there was a mystery behind this Parable there was a significance of what he was saying every little detail in the parable had a meaning it was perfect this was a parable was an example a story a picture of something really that was speaking of a greater picture speaking of something of an eternal value something in the mind of God a plan amen that he begin to speak and unfold amen the whole the whole chapter of Matthew 13 is all Parables and all is a mystery of this last day is all revealing the plan of God and Jesus here begins to speak this Parable and he says a certain man planted a Vineyard and set a hedge about and dig a place for the wine fat and built the Tower and let it out to husband men and went into a far country brother he he he said a whole lot in one little verse but many times without understanding without ration we cannot just catch entirely what he's saying but when you look at it he's speaking of one that planted a Vineyard he set a hedge of protection round about it then he begins to show how little by little he began to build this vineard he began to edify this Vine he began to uh build it and make it a a full complete V and then he said he gave it into the hands of husbandmen and he went away understand Jesus in that first verse has just spoke of 4,000 years hallelujah hallelujah at the season he sent the husband men a that he might receive from the husband of the fruit of the vineyard they C him and beat him and Sh him away he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and send him away as shamefully hand and handled shamefully handled he another and they killed and many others beating some and killing some having yet therefore one son his well beloved he sent him also last last mhm unto them saying them they will reverence my son they will reverence my son but those husband men said among themselves this is the air come let us kill you and inheritance shall be ours and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the oh they cast him out what shall therefore the Lord of The Vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandman and will give the vineyard unto others have you not read the scripture the St which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the Lord's doing that is marvelous in our eyes hallelujah hallelujah and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they know they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way they understood exactly what he was talking he was desing just by speaking this terrible not saying it directly but just speaking a little Parable just saying this little story here but he knew what was in their hearts they had conspired they had a to Hallelujah so in verse in verse S is where we take our context from today the husbandman cuz in verse six he sent his sonov in verse seven the husband and said this is the air hallelujah hallelujah remember our scripture Romans 8 when they saw him they said this is the come let us kill and The Inheritance shall be ours oh my Hallelujah sisters when you look at what Jesus is speaking in this Parable from verse two he begins to unfold how that once it was given into the hands of the husband that in different seasons in different times in times p and in many seasons he spoke to the father in The Prophet but at lastu Hallelujah is that and what is he speaking of Hallelujah Hallelujah this is this really spoke to me and I feel the Holy Spirit as we have spoke about it I'm sure that the sons of God and the daughters of God know what I'm talking about when we feel that the the thing is coming closer and closer remember what we spoke last Sunday about the de amen how God gave him a certain nature is that right and that nature is able to deserve when something is getting close he can hear the sound he can smell when the hunters are getting close is that right there's something that God put in him amen that it begins to activate greater and greater the closer amen that this is coming to him and that's why David said amen my soul amen first after the Living God Amen as the as the a deer planted for the water Brooks so my soul curs after the Living God hallelujah hallelujah and we see that this same nature is in the body of Jesus Christ if we are sons of God we are led by the spirit of God said inside of every Son of God that has received the Holy Spirit there is a portion of discernment because the holy spirit is the one that discern not you the holy spirit amen hallelujah so when we see that this same thing amen it's coming back again amen there is a spiracy there is a to destroy the seed and thees of God in the last days and that is Satan's plan since heavenu he is always s to to destroy amen God's seed so that he can become a where there's no more seed amen remember what Abraham said when God promised him a son and he said that that son would be the he of all thingsam said that son is Jesus not the son of his flesh but the son of his his faith amen the son of his faith was Jesus Christ the son of his flesh was ISAC amenu then we see that Abraham told God Amen you have promised me a son and that he is my he amen but I have no children and only El eer of Damascus amen my servant shall call Air to all things in other words there is no seed to take the inheritance The Inheritance goes to someone else and that's what Satan has done from the beginning he has wanted to destroy the sea he has wanted to destroy destroy the seed because he knows if he can eliminate the seed completely he will be and what Jesus is speaking here he is showing that it's the devil through his seed the seed of the serpent that killed the prophets sent the servants God sent the servant and and they killed he s they he sent another one and they killed they s God sent a prophet and they killed him amen it is the seed of the serpent amen that killed from all the way to John the Baptist and here is Jesus telling them amen there was a man that pled a in hallelujah hallelujah was he a man did he come down in the evening and he would speak to his children hallelujah hallelujah that El to God that was Jehovah god with his family that was JB amen that was him that pled that V and he put a around is that right his word to protect it Hallelujah he dig a place for the wine amen then he built the power what do you need a power in the vineyard for Amen to watch watch when what of the night amen the night cometh and the morning cometh also hallelujah hallelujah amen there's dark times coming amen but the that the morning is coming also the resurrection to God Amen and that Tower is to and that hedge is to protect the vine is that right the Hedge is to not let the little foxes come in and sto the vine when the grapes are tended that's what Song of Solomon said Hallelujah and brother says it's the little foxes that spoils the vine it's those little things that you leave undone in your life that spoils The Vineyard amen there's those things that we don't take care of we allow that the TR is come in and SPO the vine when the grapes are tender in other words they don't want the grapes to ripen they don't want maturity Hallelujah they want to spoil that amen so that that the the wine fact won't be used inside of the vineyard they're not going to throw into the vine C amen a sour grapes great green grapes no sh they're going to throw to that wine back mature make the wine and make that V you understand they're not going to immature graes into the wine that's what the tower is for that's what the that's what the Watchman is for right amen amen that's what the H is for and the husband men the husband men that are there amen they are to work amen oh see what what happened what happened he gave it into the the hands of his people of his nation of his natural SE that's who gave the vard to he gave the vineyard to the Jews he gave the vineyard to Israel amen amen amen hallelujah and they were the ones that had it in their hand but they failed they failed they do the work that the vineyard requires they failed to do it amen and they Satan to Blind more more and more they were so by the end of this when the man that planted the sent his son I'm going to get into that a little they were soind that they s to kill who was it that killed the prophets that took the Serv that cast stones that wounded that beat and kill the prophets that God it was the serpent seed that was in the v outside they were inside of the they were theallu that's what theable the parable doesn't say that some thieves from the outside of the dropped the Hedge amen and broke in and they killed no it says the husband that were inside of the that's a det that's in the that's in the but Jesus is showing the int thetive of these evil one amen why because they are the evil when when Jesus went down to Hell amen after dying on the cross he went down there to take the keys Satan but when he came down there and Satan saw him he said I thought I killed you I thought I had you when I Ked I thought I had you when I kill this one when I killed Isaiah when I killed this other one when I this one amen I I that amen that's the devil that was working through his all those anges because he is telling Jesus I thought I had you when I this I that but who killed but who was inside ofil wanting to kill the to become a but God said I will not leave my ho one that suffer corruption hallelujah amen God is determined that he will have a Hallelujah and that can never fail they kill on he raises up another if they kill this one he raised up S in a resurrection God is determined to have his and his SE is always hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you believe that say Amen you believe am amen hallelujah the evil one who killed the servant after servet after but now the son is here the prophets the prophets that that the father sent one planted the vard they were a portion of the word they were a part of the amen they were the word for that particular hour amen but now he sent the son the fullness of the word he sent the fullness of the godhead hallelujah hallelujah was that him right there standing was that the fullness of the godhead was that the son hallelujah amen you see many times we we we we don't understand the language of the Bible because Theology and and Creeds of the Gentiles has distorted what the scriptures meant even the Jews knew let ask that Rabbi who is Isaiah 96 speaking of unto us a child is born amen a son is given amen speaking of the Messiah his name called The Mighty God the Everlasting father you understand he said who will the Son of God be who will the Messiah be he said nothing but God Hallelujah the Jews knew that that's why when Jesus said I am the Son of God they said blasphemy you make yourself equal with God say that you're the son they had more Revelation they had more understanding of the scripture than the Gentiles when the Gentiles today when the church hears the son they say okay the father greater and then the son is less M the son isn't lesser it's the very one that planted the ined manifested in a body amen God was in Christ the world to it was the fullness of the godhead amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen am Christ is the mysty of God hallu Christ is revealed in his own word but he said he sent his son and the husband said this is the why is the son the Earth he is the son he is to all the father has what Jesus adopted he adoped he brought did the voice say hear ye him this is my beloved Son everything that I own is his whatever he says is my word hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen that's why Paul said amen we are a with God and Jo with Christ because he is the first many brothers Hallelujah the son is here the prophets were part of the word Jesus was the fullness of the word he was the air how believe has always known when the seat of God is on the SE that's why he always MIM that's why he always imp me what God is doing he knows when the seat of God is there who was it that tried to kill all the children just to get that one amen the seat of God the deliverer is here I don't know where he at I don't know who he is but I'm going to start killing all the children just to see if I get maybe it's this one maybe it's this one maybe it's this one Hallelujah but there was a woman there to God that had seen of fire the Hallelujah she had seen the star Hallelujah she said I don't care what the say Amen I'm stand in this and my husband prayed anded anded and now here is the to our pray and I'm not going to let the devil take it away hallelujah hallelujah is in your hands to God amen

children the days of Jesus the seat of God here somewhere I don't know who he is I don't know where he's amen but I'm going to kill him oh my this is Satan's plan and that was religious people that was the spirit of the anti they would speak they would say yes let's protect our world let's protect all of the homosexuals homosexuals they love God [Music] it's are how this grou to speaking Conference of the United States government and speak about men like Moses speak of men like Abraham lincol goes to show he's fulfilling in the scripture Jesus said they Garn the tomes of the prophets they the ones that put who killed ab and there he is there's ever been a hypocrite speaking of abrah he's Abraham and this one and that one it's a block it's a conspiracy [Music] to in the last days this brother and if you can catch this let me say this the very reason that this persecution has come the very reason that this conspiracy is on that this is on amen amen the very reason that this evil serpent SE this Children of the devil are conspiring against this last day amen just like those evil spirits in the days of Jesus knew that he was the son and that the son had arrived and that he was so the same evil spirit knowing this last day son amen he was there Amen in all the services of the prophet he was there at the preaching of the seals don't think he wasn't he knows what is come amen you don't think he know you don't think he knows oh who is this guy people he SM s and I got this and that's the very reason since those years am that roal Council of church is in the making now why not why not before why not before in the in the pr Council amen they got together and the United States in church and they persecuted and they killed 68 million amen but brother and sister this is going to be something greater than anything else they know knew when he seen this message when he seen this Prophet huj seen this word hallelujah hallelujah this is the I better kill this I better kill so I can become and that's the reason is because his evil spirit Satan himself acknowledges that the have come infection amen hallelujah the air hallelujah hallelujah and they ploted a persecution against the word in its fullness to kill him and so it is with this last day these evil spirits know that the sons of perfection know that the message has amen the devil knows that these are the sister he knew oh my this is coming back to that superace that was supposed to be in the beginning I better stop this know he was there to God didn't he come and see when he began to see amen this man stand there and said you woman you have this in your neck and that was caused by an accident since you had an accident this has been there is that correct yes it is the Lord Jesus Christ you

Council of churches let's get all the Parise and the S amen let's get a let's get a traitor amen let's get somebody inside amen am oh my that's the truth let's get some people it that said when the prophet himself was walking preaching and manifesting the ones Clos to amen went to go see the pop went to the went to the World Council of church was toose us oh myen amen oh brother Hallelujah see if you notice in the par Jesus speaking singular of the one who planted the he says he the he he did the wine that he amen did these things fill the tower you understand all those things [Music] by it was the spirit of God manifesting these things just like it was the spirit of the devil in his children killing the on understand he says he did this he did this the person of God himself so he left his his predestinated people his servants in responsibility of the vine resp amen amen The Vineyard see the vineyard amen come with the responsibility it comes with a privilege amen it come with a tremendous privilege but it come with respons that's why when they failed to take that responsibility amen they begin to get they begin to get carried away by man's interpretation and by the time Jesus come they had the law of Moses they had the Commandments they had all these other added things to it me mm there all kinds of attit am and all kinds of extras and all kind of things added to what God Said Amen same thing is happening again same thing that's why Jesus said seeking first the kingdom of God amen amen and the rest take care of amen amen but notice these husband men became more and more irresponsible didn't want to take the responsibility of the king the king has laws kingom has orders who was the vineyard brother oh what is the vineyard The Vineyard is the kingdom but

Earth are the ones in the vineyard you believe that okay hallelujah hallelujah listen know what the prophet says the mage a testimony on the sea2 I would like to take the time if God permits before the end time I can tell a tent in a certain vicinity and it there and some and someone we prayed for see and we could over see what happen I believe we get better results see but we want to get this before the people this is my purpose to believe the Lord Jesus Christ is not dead He's Alive the prophet came and they killed them one by one the prophets and monarchs and so forth they wased when the son came they said he's a so we'll kill him but when they killed him he raised up he raised up for you and so he's alive for he's the same yesterday all the ones that he has killed not just the ones from this last day amen amen all the ones that he are going to again hallelujah hallelujah and they still continue to after he's no more he can't kill the SE because in the SE there's eternal life and you can't kill eternal life it's impossible but he still see he thinks just because the prophet is gone that's it that's the end of the prop that's what we have PR that promise according to the word of God and according to the message of the interpretation amen but what the word says there's a resurrection amen am and in that Resurrection Prophet gave us the order of the resurrection and he told us the first be last the last shall be first each age they rise with their messes Hallelujah that's that's the word or it's not the word amen amen word hallelujah there is a resurrection are you not Resurrection [Music] he's the same yesterday today and forever alive that same one in theet Is Alive in the message it's alive in the predestinated seat it's alive he said my live what he says I'm going to take the word of God and I'm going toide every denomination there is if I could only get the people to realize that you'll see something spontaneous happen that it will shape the whole country and I I'm going to take the word of God and guide every denomination there is every man on the face of the Earth that's guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ yes oh sers make fun of him this is the reproach for the cause of the words they reproached him he stayed right with him oh watch what he did he was the son of God he suffered death in order to put sin to death that's the only way why it could be he could be put to death and he did this and stood it CU all the rest of them did because all of them back there amure word of God because Jesus said so the word of the Lord came to the prophets which one of them he said that your father's organized religion didn't stwn and put to death which one of them received the prophets then you buil a tomb after they were gone and he said you're guilty of putting them in there then he gave them the parable about the vineyard she let out the vineyard out and the servants come and they ministered and they mistreated them then finally said now will kill the son because he's a he see all they got angry when they seen that but he had to stand the reproach and here he has himself bound led up to death in order to be put to death to bring back eternal life glory to God how I love him bring back eternal life and raise up every Son of God down Through the Ages stood with that word and took the reproach that's right in the days of Noah in the days of Moses they sent the prophets to them what did they do they stoned them put them the death saw the pieces they burned them any way to get rid of them they got them off of their hands and Jesus T the very f Parable he brought a parable and he said there was a man a great man and had he had a Vineyard and put dressers in it and he sent a servant and they killed him and he sent another servant and they killed him said finally said I'll send my son and they'll regard him and the dressers of the V this is the a let's kill him that was God's son that he s he sent the prophets sending his word the word of God remember every falling generation there is only one thing that can bre this world together that's the word of God Andes Jesus here is saying man has always tried to make excuses no it may be firmly proven to him you see if you read Matthew 22 you find the excuses were made is connected to the parable of Matthew 21 it's the same parable 12 and Matthew 21 is the same Parable and in connection with that Parable is the parable of the great feast amen amen amen watch the prophet connecting it here it went back into all ages went back into the age and said a man bat them and he had a amen and he had a vard see he's connecting both scenes he's connecting both ter he had vineard and he them to come see and we find that Parable how he send servants to collect from thisor first servant come what they do they run him off the next one they Stone him they run a servant after servant the CR men the king sent finally his son and when his son came we find out they said this an we kill him then we'll have all things will have all is your life worthy of the Gospel this is the air will kill him then we'll have all things why because Son of God is to all things will be he of all things then Jesus said to him the king sent forth in slew those murderers and burn their cities that's not included in in Mark 12 but it's included in Matthew 21 amen hallelujah we probably won't have time to get into it but here amen 23 he's speaking the same Parable head around wi built a tower put it in the hands of of the Ser of the husband he sent a Ser kill him s another one all this right verse 37 but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will leverage my son but when the husband men saw the son they said among themselves say the air come let us kill let us kill him and let on his inance and they caught him and cast him out of the vard and slew him when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto the old husband man they sayto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and let us let out his Vineyard unto other husband men which shall render him the fruits in their season Jesus said unto them did you never read in the scriptures reject the S become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and is marvelous in our eyes therefore say unto you the kingdom of of God shall be taken from you and given to the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof you see what the is is the kingdom what I said at the beginning remember it shall be taken from you given to another a nation bringing forth fruits no doubt the Jew thought it was a natural Nation who's that Nation said it's a holy nation a royal pre am the Heavenly jeral Hallelujah bringing for fruit and whever shall fall this Stone shall be broken but shall fall him power amen what is that The Headstone Revelation Jesus was The Headstone of the Old Testament amen and he was the Cornerstone in the beginning of creation yes sir and he again was the Cornerstone on the day of Pentecost and he is The Headstone in these last days you say amen hallelujah now notice Jesus told him the king the king sent forth and threw those murders remember what we said earlier when they cast out the son what happened God rose up Titus the Roman general slaugh and God his way not Comm he's raising up he's raising up these dict Hallelujah and all her daughter Hallelujah he will do it he's going to S kill these husb be slaughtered and killed that's why Revelation 19 says come to the great feast of the great God the of the eat on thees of captain thees of great Hallelujah that's God's Feast did you know that's his Feast B it's going to be a bloody B going to be some slaughtering taking place brother he's going to try the wine press of it's a terrific thing to fall in the hands of a living God they wh and cry oh brother and sister God is horrible but it's coming it's going to come and destroyes World bur hallu hallelu same thing today the hus men they had made all kinds of excuses is connecting am Hallelujah I just bought a house I just got married I just got this new job amen amen all kinds of excuses to they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the days of elij they made excuses in the days of Christ they make excuses today and now him speaking directly to is inbl speaking directly to Israel the ones who was called To The Feast that it would also apply today to men the church who has beened to come to the feast and won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord they don't want to do it they don't want to do it they got other things to do they find excuses if Israel took thousand years ago would have accepted the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be as they are today 2 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding and they turned it down and went into judgment but Jesus said they Stone and killed the prophets why they made excuses I'm not adding to it Jesus said they Stone and kill the prophet that they s to do by making excuses hallu amen both he's connecting Matthew 21 with Matthew 22 2 33 Matthew 22 verse one to 14 the parable of the feast connected both of them together Hallelujah not different it's the same thing Jesus said they Stone and killed the prophets that was sent to them by making excuses now the excuses they made in each day we find in the days of Jesus and he didn't affiliate with any of them they said when when did this man get his learning he come from it's not Mr Carpenter son isn't his mother called Mary isn't his brother Joseph and James isn't his isn't his sisters with us Jesus sisters with the Pharisees did you know that even his own fleshly Brothers The Book of John it's his brothers is in his sister with us then where did this man get

out there like a wild man don't pay attention to him we know what happened to Israel they screamed out they were so sure that this man was until they condemed him in said let his blood be upon us our children it's been there ever since that's Titus Jesus was trying to tell them that their excuses am he was trying to tell them their excuses was what killed the prophet and what kill the righteous that come they accepted their Creed that men had G them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so made the word of God so didn't he say in Psalm 80 come didn't he say in Psalms 8 that his
