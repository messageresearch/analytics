[1:18] things you will not
[1:21] catch these other
[1:24] things it'll go over the top of your
[1:27] head as far as easy is from
[1:32] W in this time that we're at now if you
[1:36] can't see those little
[1:38] things we're we're into something
[1:42] now that God is
[1:44] revealing the Hidden
[1:47] Mysteries that's been put in the book
[1:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:53] if you can't see the little
[1:56] things you won't be able to see the
[1:59] mystery
[2:01] that is being revealed they will go over
[2:04] your
[2:05] head oh Lord did you hear what he's
[2:08] saying and then after he says that he
[2:11] says like
[2:13] Gideon separating his men there was
[2:17] thousands and
[2:18] thousands and God said that's too many
[2:21] separate them he gave them another test
[2:25] and then he separated them again he gave
[2:28] them another test and down he went until
[2:31] he got a little
[2:33] handful and he said that's the group I
[2:37] want to do the
[2:41] job what happened
[2:43] Hallelujah that's why in this hour I
[2:46] read the quot this morning perfect Faith
