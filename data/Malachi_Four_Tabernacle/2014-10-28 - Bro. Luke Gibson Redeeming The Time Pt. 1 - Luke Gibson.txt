========================================
de gra How Sweet the Sound that save like I want but now ohaz Grace oh how oh that oh L I am found all help me say praise the Lord this morning sure good to be in the house of the Lord with you amen no better place to be than the house of yes sir Amen brother this morning for giving us the privilege to come and be able to minister to this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen should appreciate the Lord and all of his grace this morning I don't believe there'd be one of us here this morning if it wasn't for the grace of God yes sir amen take the center out on the street the only difference between them and us is the grace of our Lord amen you have your Bibles this morning we'd like to get right into our message Ephesians 5 and I would like to read this morning from verse uh 14 down to verse 21 verse 14 of Ephesians chapter 5 Paul says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be be filled with the spirit Hallelujah speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God I would like to back up this morning and look at verse 15 and verse 16 again with you the Apostle Paul again says see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise and I would like this morning by the help of God take our message from verse 16 Redeeming the time because the days are evil let's just bow our heads this morning Our Father Again Lord a great privilege to be able to stand this morning in your divine presence and Lord to be able to speak the wonderful words of life now father as we have opened the word of God and we have read from its Pages we pray that the great author that wrote the word come now and speak it to our hearts may you speak to every individual this morning may we walk out of this place closer to our lord Jesus we give you the pre now in the remaining of this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen God bless you you seated if I was going to put a title on this this morning I would like to call it Redeeming the time now this morning I'm going to try my best to slow down so our brother can keep up with me he did a wonderful job last night but I felt like I ran off too much so you bear with me this morning but I want to say this on the onset of our message each one of us were born into this world we were not born with eternal life the prophet of God said that when Adam fell in the Garden of Eden brother Adam told us in the message called the breach that Adam fell from eternal life and when he fell from eternal life we understand that the property God taught us in marriage and divorce that the chasm was broken and that they came out of Eternity and stepped down into time one time brother bradam draw a circle like this at the bottom of the circle he put a little little spot here like this and he said the circle was eternity and this little drop here was what we call time he said this little time element here that happened because of the fall but one day time will blend again with eternity and this will go up and fit into the circle not be time as we know this morning but it will be eternity now brother bam says that we are all time creatures when we were born in this world we were born as time creatures not Eternal creatures our life is set by time each one of us have a certain date that we came into this world and God has alloted a time that we'll leave this world the scripture teaches us it's appointed of the de once to die then after this the judgment and if God should that each one of us will have to go by way of the grave and on our Tombstone they'll place a date that we came in the world they'll place a date that we leave the world and what those days are is our experience with time now many times people believe that we are time creatures trying to experience eternity but really we're not we are Eternal creatures who have experienced time because when time is over we'll go back in the eternity where we came from before the foundation of world now as I said our life is set by time a time we begin a time we end then in between those two days there's a little Dash and that little Dash is our life it's how we live it's how we conducted ourselves but most people only remember when we began and when we end because our life is marked by time everything that we do is by time we work by time we come today and we got here by a certain time I'll Preach Today by time we sleep by time we go to bed by time we wake up by time it's simply because that we are ti creatures but sometimes in time we come into a place like this we tried to forget about time and enter into what is eternal because really what matters to us it's not time and it's what is eternal right and the Most Blessed thing that God gave us is what is eternal now with land me he crossed that castle he went from me Eternal over the time Satan stole eternal life the Propet said we fail from it and we went into time and now that we're in time Satan wants to keep us away from what is eternal my brother I'm so glad this morning that we serve a God that by his grace come down in the time Hallelujah became a Time creature thank you Lord our sin defeated our enemies conquered death H the grave send it back to the father and S the Holy Ghost now when I think about time for a minute the Holy Spirit Dr the scriptures and let me just lay this out and say there the scriptures definitely speak to us of a concept of time it seems that God has prescribed time in the scriptures he has determined by his sovereignty a certain definite time in other words God would deal with Israel for a certain time he would turn from Israel and deal with the Gentiles and then he would deal with Gentiles for a certain time God brother said God aots time time is controlled by a sovereign God one day time as we know it will cease I want to watch closer this morning time as we know it will ceas so we only have an aoic time on this Earth because what is eternal we fell from now what we're trying to do while we're in time it's get back to what is eternal can you say Amen now I want you to watch as I preference verse 16 this morning where Paul tells us to redeem time that's a strange statement to me for a man to tell me to redeem time if I understand the word redeem as brother describ it means to buy back how can I buy that time something that was stole from me or from me how can I redeem it back let me preference that minute morning with verse 15 of Ephesians 5 where Paul tells us to walk circumspectly and then he says not as fools but as wise so Paul tells us number one that we are to walk circumspectly now there's a word circum it literally means to walk accurately to walk diligently to walk precisely then he tells us how we can do that he tells us to do that by not walking in this world as fools but as wise and how do we do that by redeeming our time now here's what's amazing for minut in the book of Ephesians Paul uses three words and these three words give a physical position of every believer he starts out the first chapter and tells us that we sit with Christ in Heavenly places the next place he tells us that we are to stand with the gospel then he uses the word that we're to walk in the life so he says one time we're to sit another time we're to stand another time we're to walk here he tells us that we to walk circumspect let me just describe this for when he talks about walking he's talking about something that is Progressive for example when man fell and as brother Adam said he fell from eternity fell from eternal life became a Time creature all of a sudden God comes down out of Heaven brother B said the cool of the evening he came down to man now by the way by the way man never shot for God God shot for man God wasn't never lost we was the ones that was lost and God had to come and find us do you believe that if God didn't find us we would have never been found man left to himself cannot find God God must seek us said man has never sought God God has always what Happ here ad is a fallen condition and the scripture says that Adam heard the voice of the lord god notice what it says walking it says the voice of the Lord's God was walking now look if you're going to identify with the voice voice of God you better be able to walk because that voice is going to unfold the word as the word is unfold said we must walk in the and he said we walk in the word will unfold let me show you this God voice was walking I don't know if youve ever noticed the pillar of fire you notice brother is very clear but the pillar fire is hazy because that pillar fire is constantly moving the picture was caught as the pillar fire is moving if you're going to follow this message you got to be moving the one pipe that brother used from the garden to represent the bride being translated was Enoch Adam heard God's voice walking in the of identified Ed it said he walked with God was not God took walked with God take Noah he was a prophet the Bible said Noah walked with God take Abraham the Bible says walk before me and be th perfect now when our lord Jesus was here he told the disciples while you have the light believe the light walk while you have the light Darkness come upon you when God's word unfold itself the bride has to walk with the word do you understand Lu had but when the light moved on the believer had to go with the light and those that to walk with the life their life became the W message became dark after the open S we don't have we have man here God told us to walk in the light as he is in the life then he say we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all so walking speaks of the progressive activity of the holy spirit in a man's life he is consistently walking as God unfolds his that beli walks in the life now watch this he says that we are to walk circumspective that word literally means that we walk with accuracy we walk with carefulness we want to make sure that where we're walking is where the light is cuz remember anything outside of this message brother said there's no life in it and if there's no life in it there's no life in it in him was life and the life was the life of men yes sir amen now it tells us what how we can walk in the light how we can walk circumspectly he says not as fools but as wise he tells us in that same chapter verse 8 for ye were sometimes Darkness but now you are light in the Lord watch he's not just saying you're walking in he says you are the light says is the manifestation of the spoken word of God now be said be a and you're here that is here you are the which is the life of the that's right you're the but now watch what he say you're the light but then he says walk as children of life you're the but walk as children life if you're the life walk as a child of life do you believe that yes sir I want I want you just see how this goes just he says awake thou the sleepest arise from the dead now he can't be talking about the grave out he's talking about us being dead in our trespasses our I'll just go further our denominational unbelief he said to rise from the dead and Christ shall give the light can you say slumbering foolish Christians we're going to unfold this in a second arise from the dead Christ shall give thee light here's an example of that fools why Jesus had come he died buried raised again walked on the earth for 40 days one day he met two men on the road to and the Bible said they were sad they communed among themselves Jesus came up and he begin to ask him what Communications are these and you're sad and he says this what man of communicating with these that you have one with another as ye walk and they're sad do you understand these two men Believe In Christ but missed the interpretation of the scripture the now watch what Jesus Says by telling them they missed it oh yes yes yes the prophet SP sir do you understand these two disciples when they miss the man word not believe in the Prophet come brother matter if you understand you believe what Jesus called them fools and then the Bible said you know the rest of the story he entered into their home and then he opened the word the scriptures he was trying to get them to see the scriptures that was promised for that hour had already been interpreted and then the scripture said he broke the bread their eyes were open and they knew him and then the Bible says he opened their understanding seei word God that's what call walking circumspect now I want to unfold this next verse now a man would have to be a fool to start a journey and not know where he's going told me well Abraham didn't know Abraham met a king one day he met a man in and the only I can tell you is after he met that man and that man Departed the scripture says Abraham look for a city whose Builder and maker is God Abraham had a destination and it was that future home someone said why would Abraham look for a ship because he met the king of the ship when he met and Cath was a king he knew there had to be a had to be a land and Abraham sought for that now let's watch this Paul is simply telling us to walk in wisdom to walk circumspect to not walk as fools but to walk as wise now watch this closely here's how he teaches us to walk in wisdom number one redeeming the time now we we say redeon means to buy back but I want you to watch this morning to buy back something that's been lost we're going to buy it back I say if we lost it we can't buy back I'm going to prove that wrong you remember when man fa God told Adam the day you eat thereof that day you to surely die one day with the Lord is a thousand years with man and every man that ever came into the world he died within a day there was never a man that could live a thousand years on this Earth the oldest man that ever lived wasth he lived 969 years and he died there was no man that ever lived a thousand years because God said the day you eat thereof that day you should Sur die so no man will ever live without but did you notice when the is raptured three half years of tribulation we don't know the future home that Abraham looked for we sto come back to earth and we live 1,000 years why do we live 1,000 years because God has given us back the day that upon this Earth and God is going to set in the Millen with Jesus Christ and live 1,000 years not eternity said the seven days it's still Hallelujah tells us that that lufer is Bound for Thousand Years now a prophet does not teach us that Lucifer is bound by a long chain but he said a change of circum he said millenni Lucifer don't have anybody to work for everyone that's in that Mill is in a glorified form you understand so he's got nobody to work for 1,00 years Satan's got to twindle his Hallelujah nothing to do and for 1,000 years Satan and all of the Devils is going to have to watch us live for you know that he called that a 1,00 year Hy we we 10 days they were really blessed two weeks Heaven come down with in three weeks but I'm talking a do you believe it now with that thought in mind list proceed to what Paul's talking he tells us that as Believers we we can redeem now we already know God will do it but he says we can do it now my question is brother how can I redeem time now listen this the word they go the word there means to buy up opportunities let me explain it to you the Latin word go look it up literally means towards the port like a ship going towards the port a destination so here's what he says you and I are heading somewhere and we're going to the destination we're trying to get to the port and we need to buy up every opportunity that would bring us closer to our destination now you say brother Luke we somewh believe CH toy every opportunity bring you closer to your here's the thought behind I got I got to lay this in here so you understand the quote I'm about the read the word suggest this to buy time it's a sh that takes advantage of every wind and every tide to safely to the let me expl if the time is coming out and the ship tries to get in he's wasting time because he has to fight the current the curent is pushing him out so he's wasting time but if that current flow out then as it flows back in he gets us that opportunity rise back that's called redeeming time buying up opportun brother let me say this every time the Holy Ghost comes into a me that's good brother that's good your OPP toall the the Holy Ghost you got to get in the Holy Ghost time redeem your offer J theot or the uses his skill to make sure that when that current goes out and as it goes back in it sets his saes and he sets his SA so he can use the wind and the current to bring him into his I see so many people day fighting God right when you stay at home on Sunday morning the Curr you know what I'm talking about when you lay in bed instead of coming to church you're fighting the C when you get out of there and you come to church you let me read this to you come on now come on said he said now my daughter-in-law said this morning let me just read a couple of these he says last evening while we were sting waiting on Billy Paul to bring the car we were in the hotel lobby there was a ballroom floor and they were playing rock and roll music and smoking cigarettes and doing some kind of dances now little children boys that's 12 years old smoking cigarettes of little girls and he says Billy's wife looked to brother BR and she said to brother br pray for me let me tell you young people something this Holy Ghost we're preaching it ain't just for the old people same holy ghost that baptizes come on brother the same holy ghost that baptizes you Hallelujah it make everybody act just like yes sir now brother mam says she says Billy pray for me now watch this they were in a meeting he says all week over in her room I heard her singing songs I heard her singing last evening before she went to church my favorite song down from his glory she started reading her Bible and she's pre read the Bible through this week he said you go to s's Hy reading your Bible meditating on the word and a strange will appear to you what he said it was while the men were on the road to M he to talk to them he stepped from behind the bushes and walked with them he says the reason uh we don't have spiritual blessings watch we have too much time to watch television too much time newspaper listen to something that we ought not be listening to and we're not redeeming our time giving it to the things of the world instead of to the Lord Jesus now want you watch what he's said his daughter-in-law his daughter-in-law before she ever got to church was reading her Bible she was singing songs in her H what was she doing she was fired up opportunities she had her time away from home she was in church she was in a meeting so she was giving herself to the word she was singing songs she was redeeming her time so that when she went to church she could set her and when the Holy Ghost would come in that PR would have to P already how can I say this so you understand you don't wait to get to church to start CH you come come sing the word you walk already you start and the of God how many people sit right in a message Church the holy spirit moves and they fight the current they fight the current because they're not redeeming their time the preachers got to spend 30 minutes trying to get over people's waste of time their minds are somewhere in the world their minds are thinking about what they got to do tomorrow let me just tell you oh Lord even take thought for tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself you about what's going right now see come back you get your say yes Lord I need the Holy Ghost yes Lord I need a healing yes Lord I Need A Touch yes Lord shut yourself let the Holy Spirit you have to redeem time it's because you have to do it in the light that this opportunity could soon be gone listen when that s out in the ship and that way it comes and then it goes back if he hadn't redeemed his time and he don't know when that opportunity is going to come again that's why I don't understand about people every church service you can never get this back this Sunday morning will never return again you got to get everything you can out of this service we are to get to the place that we save the Lord I'm not even going home till I get what I need that's right brother you remember the man said went out there he wanted the Holy Ghost and the prophet said he went out there in the woods and he found the log and he got down and he said Lord you'll either give me the holy ghost or they'll find a pack of bones that man was going to redeem the time this was his God can't pass man that kind ofh that's right brother yes sir amen it just seems that people are not hungry for the way that's right that's true that's so true listen as it passes or what we say time by the clock you know brother R talked about time should be no more and in the breach brother says denomination ages have run out 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 the time that God deals with Gentiles about it's only going to be so long god Set 2,000 years seven Church ages that he would deal with Gentiles when that door shut it wouldn't matter how much a man be on if God ever shuts the door it's over my opportunity has passed can never be brought back that's right brother I believe predestination they won't be one that door what God has redeemed everyone but there's going to be people like es that's going to seek it that's going to want it and they let the opportunity to receive it passing by and never be able to redeem it back that's why Paul said redeem it now listen to this do you know there is no one ever saved tomorrow did you know no one your loved ones will never be saved tomorrow if you got a lost husband here this morning tomorrow he'll never be saved try if he ever gets saved it'll be today you said what if he comes tomorrow it'll be today today the salvation not tomorrow so if you had church tomorrow and someone come and got saved they been saved today be today today the day that's what we ain't promis come on Brother come on now come on you don't even know if you'll be here Tom but I know one thing I'm here today come on Hallelujah the word time also means a special chosen time a strategic time of opportunity a limited time some of you sisters how many you sisters like Walmart I call that the message shopping center you never go to Walmart you see somebody in the message you know how they get us you got to buy this this is only on S for a limited time and what they're telling you buy while it lasts we got buy this it's only for a limited time so I'll buy a week later it's back on sale cheaper than what it was I B I said you can't believe what they tell you the only one that you can really put your faith in that what he tells you is right it's this word of God right every else the word do you believe that look you got a pastor here this morning let me hurry you got a pastor here if God carries this man willon always be here come on Brother come on people take for granted the gift that God put but you understand God can remove that gift any time this man right here God put in him a gift to preach I said a gift to preach he didn't buy he didn't earn it he was born with it you know why he was bored with it because God had you in mind speak people he his week studing God's word allowing his gift to work then he comes the pit here his gift is standing right here in the pit that gift begins to work for the people and some of you stay home my mind my mind say we can get how many y ever been over to the eastn South Carolina never let me tell you what you're not going to find in South Carolina you ain't never going to find a cactus in South Carolina caus don't grow in God put causes where he knew they would grow he put trees over there you got certain trees that grow here certain plants that grow here we got certain trees that grow in the south over in the East and you got certain ones here God puts the sea in the ground where he knows it'll grow yes if orain of God to be under that gift you'll never grow under my gift that's right the ground God put you inated you receive the word not it's not I'm it's he's everything Lord your Lord that's the reason isimportant now I guess I can't emphasiz this enough enough you say it never happen me take the Bible Hebrews 10:25 says forsaking not the Assembly of yourselves together as the man of some is it got to the place that some people didn't believe they needed the local church anymore and Paul said you're not to do what some are already doing watch what he says but so much the more as you see the day approaching you say brother what day let me describe this to you cuz you're enjoying something right now that is an opportunity that's going to pass you by one of these days Based On th sayth the Lord the prophet of God said one of these days I got it right here one of these days pretty soon they're going to tap a sign on our door out here closed and we're going to have to meet in other places listen to me they're going to come to squees I personally don't believe there's coming one I believe we begin to feel the effect start to feel that pressure down Revelation 13 but I don't know how else to say Redeeming the time because the days are evil what he talking about the day the day when they bring that persecu you either got to belong to the world C churches or you can't worship the Propet said there t a her door and some of these people that set at home don't want to come to church it's going to year for a day ride down to the local church walk through the door hear some good gospel worship God hear some good preacher they're going to yearn for that that opportunity is going to pass Lord I just that's why you don't come to those doors with a critical spirit yes too loud the good TI is too loud I wish the was Lou if you get in the spirit you would ption be glad you're in church I believe believe can know alive well I don't know brother L what one man told me said well brother Luke we don't really know how they acted on the if you don't know how they act you ain't never what they brother remember pan woman talked about she said she got the Holy Ghost sh don't tell nobody said I doubt very much the Holy Ghost he said brother when they got the Holy Ghost out the windows and the doors they like a bunch of drugs that's the real Holy Ghost never that way well it might because you never drank on the same you a real drunk a real drunk don't just drink on Sunday and Wednesday know I wedes and Sunday
