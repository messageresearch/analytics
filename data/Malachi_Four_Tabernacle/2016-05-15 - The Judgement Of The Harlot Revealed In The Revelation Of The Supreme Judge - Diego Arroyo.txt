Lord and become one a uniting time in this hour father we pray now that you would help us Lord help your people father help each one father any Spirit contrary to your word that would try to hinder that the word would penetrate Into the Heart of the people we cast it away in the name of Jesus Christ by the authority of your word father Lord to glorify you to glorify your word to to show father

am amen is good to be here in the house of the Lord amen to come and worship him in spirit and Truth to be able to come with faith in our hearts amen that without faith it's impossible to please God Amen and the Bible says word without applying faith it profits us nothing so when we come to hear the word amen we come with faith amen faith in that word amen and that word can only work by faith am people say well it didn't work for me amen I tried it and it didn't happen it's not about trying that's that's where you're wrong to begin with you're not you brother bam said if you're gonna try to see and when you come up in the prayer line you're gonna you're gonna try to see if it's true and see if you get healed he said don't even come because you you're not supposed to come that way with God amen amen when you come and approach God you come with faith I believe you Lord and you believe him because he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen amen not maybe so seek Him amen diligently with faith yes Lord I believe your word your word is true amen you you cannot lie and if you said something I believe that that I'm coming with that faith not because of what I can do but because of your promise hallelujah hallelujah that's faith in the word glory to God how many believe that how many have faith this morning it doesn't take much just a simple faith is all it takes and God's word works for the believer is that right amen it's not for the unbeliever it's not for the makeb believer it's for the believer Hallelujah Lord to God Amen the believer is who the promised word is to amen how many Happ to be in the house of the Lord amen Blessed Be His holy name we we we should be expectation amen so as we're standing God bless each one amen each one today in the name of Jesus Christ say God bless you and we love you amen Jeremiah chapter 4 amen we have I'm feeling uh been feeling for the last few days myself personally uh to wrap this uh series of Ezekiel we can stay because we can keep going into the into the scriptures and then go to the message and and keep pulling out more things but I believe that the main thing is how much can we retain amen when you pass through certain subjects like this and the Lord is revealing and revealing and revealing it's for a purpose amen amen and that purpose is so that you can see clearly through the word and the message and be able to see that and retain it in your heart as as a revelation and walk with that understanding amen amen that this is the word and I'm living in this time it's a it's a prophecy of where I'm at today you understand that so that when you go from here you take some because here and hear a lot of great but those great things to your heart it takes the Holy Spirit you believe the holy spirit is here today amen you believe he has the capability of doing that this is what we're going to be speaking on right today Jeremiah 4 verse1 if thou will return on Israel sayith the Lord return unto me th Abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not remove and thou shalt swear the Lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness the Nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they Glory see why is the Lord saying in verse one return o Israel because they have gone from him they have departed themselves from the Lord and he is giving the message through the Prophet Jeremiah to return to come back to him put away their Abominations and if they do that they shall not be removed we preached Wednesday night about the hour and Sunday of of the hour that we're living in Mercy and judgment how for much of the world Mercy is over amen for the nation for the world for the denominations it's done but God is interested in individuals and that's his work in this hour it's claiming individuals whose names are written in the book not interested in the whole nation but in those in that Nation there's individuals he's not interested in the whole denomination that's done but inside that denomination there might still be one you understand but now notice let's read here quickly verse three for thus sayith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem break up your fallow ground and so not among Thor circumcise yourselves to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem least my Fury come forth like fire and burn that none can crinch it because of the evil of your doings how many know that there's a circumcision in this hour amen Amen brother man said that's the holy spirit that circumcises the flesh the the desire of the flesh right there was a circumcision the natural Seed of Abraham and that was Amen to take away the Sur Surplus flesh amen amen too much flesh see so he's saying circumcised yourselves to the Lord the four skins of your heart see of your heart this he's not speaking to the world now no he's speaking to Men of Judah and Jerusalem he's speaking to the church that has received the message of a prophet amen amen and yes they hear it yes they're in Jerusalem they're in Judah but still they got too much flesh in their heart and he's telling them circumcise yourself glory to God verse five declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the defense cities how many know what the blowing of the trumpet means brother Bram told us in the message feat of the trumpets he says it's either for war is that right what did Paul say if the sound if the trumpet sounds who shall know what it means unless they're trained to know the sound whether it's for war whether it's for a convocation to gather the people come and gather yourselves amen or whether brother Ram said the trumpet the last trumpet amen the shout voice of Archangel and the trumpet he said the trumpet calls us up to the wedding supper it's a combo amen amen but this trumpet here amen is war hallelujah it's war and it's Gathering the people at the same time it's warning amen amen that war is coming destruction's coming but also he wants to gather them that's what it says right there set up verse six set up the standard toward Zion retire stay not for I will bring evil from the north watch that verse close from the north amen and and great destruction see the lion has come up from his Thicket before amen and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way and he has gone forth from his place to take thy land desolate and thy City shall be waste lay waste without an inhabit how many remember we we preached on this already in this series few uh weeks back for this gir you you with sackcloth lament and how for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back from us it shall come to pass at that day sayith the Lord that the heart of the king Shall Perish and the Heart of the princes and the priest shall be astonished and the prophet shall Wonder then said I oh Lord God surely thou Hast greatly deceived this people in Jerusalem saying you shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the Soul at that time shall it be said to this people in Jerusalem listen a dry wind of high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to Fan nor to cleanse from those places shall come unto me now also will I give sentence against I will give sentence where are sentences given amen amen this is time of judgment didn't the prophet preach court trial did he preach it he preached trial amen amen then he preached trial court trial is that right then he preached what shall we do with this Jesus called the Christ what what was he talking about Jesus in Pilot's Hall amen being judged by the world what shall we do with him is that right brother said what shall we do with this revealed word called Christ then what then what else did he preach IND amen amen I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ amen did the Supreme judge appear with the white wig like the old English judges that would wear the white wing and have the hammer in the hand and knock on the on the court table and say I give this sentence I sentence you for so many years that's the judge amen amen that's final word amen amen this is that hour and brother Bram said I stand as a defenser of the word of God hallelujah and I indict this generation amen amen oh brother and he said you the people amen amen are the ones that give the verdict amen amen amen he said you I'm I'm standing in defense he said he says you look at the case and you give the verdict amen amen glory to God so this is I will give my sentence against them behold he shall come up as the as clouds and his Chariot shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than Eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled oh Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts Lodge with him for a voice declareth from Dan oh brother that's that's plain amen a voice declareth from Dan who's Dan for he's the tribe of the north the eag who's Judah the one on the east the lion who's Ephraim the one in the west the the man in the South right look at verse look at verse 15 a voice declareth from Dan has a voice come from Dan in this hour The Voice from the eagle anointing that's Malachi 4 amen and publish Affliction from Mount Ephraim make you mention to the Nations behold publish against Jerusalem that Watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of Judah are they against her roundabout because she have been rebellious against me sayth the Lord heavly father we thank you Lord that as we said it earlier father you might be glorified in your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen we want to preach on the judgment of Harlot revealed in the Revelation in ration Supreme judge the Judgment of the Harlot revealed in the revelation of the Supreme judge Jeremiah is giving a prophecy of judgment coming upon Jerusalem he is still here in this chapter four he is still giving way out he still saying if you come back to me the Lord I will not remove you from the land I will not bring judgment if you repent but and he he shows how the judgment is going to strike where what direction it's coming from and how that God is going to come to bring righteous judgment how many believe that God's judgment is righteous amen am Hallelujah the Bible says in Romans 9 is God unjust and he Paul said how can the clay say until the one that made him amen amen why did you make me this amen there's no Injustice in God he's perfect it's us it's me that have to align myself to what his word says but man human human being in the natural he wants God to be like he wants well I want a god like this and I want a god like this I don't want to angry does God get angry amen amen no I just want a god of love no that's why you have all these [Music] denominations brother Bram preach thinking man's filter said and a holy man's taste the taste that people have for God is what they get that's what he preached go back and listen to that message thinking man's filter read that message preach in the morning Christ is Christ revealed in his own word and then he preached in the evening thinking man's filter in August of 65 and he said I got that inspiration went H squirrel hunting say right where the Lord appeared before where I had my experience of creating the squirrels he says I was hunting in the same place right he says and I was going by there was other Hunters that were hunting and hunting seasoning not all not all Hunters are believers you know amen wow and amongst those Hunters they throw a cigarette box right he says and there I was looked at the Box said oh there must be they must have come through here and I passed right by it I didn't pick it up I'm G let the Prophet was more against cigarettes than drinking but he did of course he didn't say you know you can drink but not smoke he didn't say that no sir no but he said this I'd rather see my wife drunk he said laid out in my living room and see my wife smoking a cigarette there's a reason why you know why when he would see a person that was shadowed with death how many know he always would say that he says people don't believe me but I see the shadow of death over that person right there that person has cancer he says in this they took the picture and there was the shadow of death over the person right there because the people heard and when he he pointed to somebody that had the shadow of death they turned around and took the picture he says and there it is there's the picture is that right how many seen it how many have seen that picture amen Prophet said in that message think man filter canc right the smoking cause cancer amen amen why do you think he was more against that then what causes sosis amen right drink drink you get ceris amen amen you're still going to die anyway amen we have a we have a cousin that's proof of that almost right name is Isaiah but doesn't live up to the name man drunk so much amen amen that he threw blood everywhere amen amen hospitalized and everything not drugs just drinking but cigarette brother bam said he says I saw one day there was a fair amen and there was a man there he says and I went to see he was proving that cigarettes cause cancer because he had a little white rat amen and did that experiment with it he said just with a little bit of smoke show that r that rat amen how it and how it ended up that right amen thing because when the angel commissioned him he said nothing will stand against you not even what cancer can amen amen not even cancer and then he and then he preached do you fear cancer amen do you fear that shadow of death that comes upon the people what is cancer brother B said that's a name that the doctors give it amen but it's a demon is that right he says but why do they call it cancer because of the sign of the cancer what's the sign of a cancer it's a crab right and what does the crab do he says it has different tentacles amen amen different arms and legs it spreads out legs right amen he said that's exactly what a cancer does in a person's body wherever it it starts then it spreads out it's a Spirit Come From Hell amen amen but then it makes itself manifest and science can prove it look it's right there but they don't know where it come from they say this caused it here and this caused it yes but there's something even behind that and then people can't believe they can believe that but they can believe that the god of Heaven can also come down from heaven and also become flesh and also take form and also brother Ram said that light inside of you begins to grow and grow and grow and grow until every fiber of your being is so filled with the Holy Ghost until even a Viper can bite you in the arm and you can shake it off like Paul in Acts 16 glory to God am Hallelujah brother bam said Paul was so filled with the Holy Ghost even his flesh was anointed that the Venom in that Viper couldn't do nothing to him amen but people they they can have more faith the satanic Spirit manifesting itself in witches and wizards amen amen and in magicians inos yes and they can prove it and say there's something there's a spiritual [Applause] world that makes them people act like but when it comes to God in his word when it comes to God's spirit when it comes to the anointed of the Holy Ghost oh that's just your fake it's religion people insane amen amen the God of this evil age has blinded the eyes of the people that's exactly what the worshiping oh my brother's not there not anger against nobody but brother said we hate sin and sin is unbelief amen does God hate sin amen amen amen why he's dealing with this throughout the entire Bible because they come in in Genesis and he finishes with sin in Revelation hallelujah amen he throws Satan he throws sin he throws unbelief unbelievers everything in the Lake of Fire he finishes with the amen amen but he has to wait 6,000 years to do that he's almost getting ready to deal with it he's already dealt with it in our lives out of your heart amen amen did did his holy fire burn it away from you it takes Holy Fire to bur that thing away nothing else can do it water can't do it blood can't do it nothing can do it but the Holy Fire of God brother said it annihilate sin when new Believers as our brother here must understand amen that I cannot conform myself amen with just one part of the scripture but I understand that I have took a step of faith in one part of the scripture that's acts 238 I have repented of my sins I have accepted Christ as my savior and I have accepted in my heart to be Lord Of My Life and Lead Me and guide me amen and I go to the waters as a ceremony yes not that that has anything to do it's just a ceremony to testify of what I've done in my heart amen and that's when you understand that you understand I'm beginning here amen amen but I have more scriptures just like that one scripture I have more Hallelujah and take another step of feet amen and I have another scripture and step into that one by faith how did you enter into the first one you believed brother Bram said amen in the message 1961 he said the same faith that you used to bring to come out of a world of sin and accept Christ he said that same faith will keep elevating more and more more don't make it complicated amen it's the same faith that they use at the beginning is the same faith that you got to keep using to keep advancing but a lot of people even in the message oh baptizing water hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen amen there's no expectation am there's no understanding that I got to keep go and they just you know baptized Hallelujah did the world change from the days of Noah when it was baptized with water no sin still come back why did God destroy with water because of sin right then he baptized it with water and sin came back out again right that didn't deal with the problem God keep advancing with his word amen prophesying that there was coming a messiah the Savior to shed his blood on Calvary Hallelujah shed that blood and that blood fell on the ground Amen brother Adam said it Sanctified the Earth is that right word to God GL Hallelujah that was blood sanctification by the blood but he said that blood that fell on the ground was only chemical of the food that Jesus ate but there was a life inside of that blood that's the token of God and that life didn't stay there it come back on the day of Pentecost amen and it filled 120 amen amen but the Earth still continued in sin and all of that how many know that sanctification is the most deceitful and it's the most dangerous place to be in because brother bam said you cannot remain too long in that condition and people don't preach that people don't know that they they think that they can be justified and Sanctified and live in sanctification for 20 years you cannot live in the state of sanctification for a long time that's not what I say that's the prophet of the age why he said he showed us why because the vessel is empty the vessel is Sanctified the vessel is clean and something something something has to fill it and if the spirit of God don't fill it then something else is going to fill it religious spirit Spirit of the world Spirit of something is going to fill it amen you understand beautiful that's why even in sanctification amen I don't do the things I used to do all the habits and things I used I don't have that no more amen I'm I'm dedicating myself to the word I'm consecrating myself amen I'm sanctifying myself in in obedience to the word the word says amen I'll do it that sanctification hallelujah hallelujah but even at the next stage amen you have to realize I cannot stay here because if I stay like this and I'm conformed that I don't have those habits no more that I don't do those things no more amen and I I know that if the promise of the Holy Spirit doesn't fill me I'm going back into those same habits I can only live in this stage for so much of a time but if I'm not filled I'm going right back brother sister this is the hour where we must press forward press forward don't give up my brother don't give up amen keep pressing forward keep believing the promise is yours come on Hallelujah don't feel discouraged don't don't worry about the voice don't worry about the devil don't worry about the people keep pressing forward I believe I believe I messed up I I made a lot of mistakes but Lord forgive me I'm going forward hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that's faith brother bam said it's not how many times you fall it's how many times you get up it's not him that starts the race it's he that finishes hallelujah hallelujah amen glory we shall finish finish it amen we shall finish it you believe that by the grace of God by his grace we shall finish the race hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God the devil is a liar amen and he's the father of Lies amen God's word is true God word will not change hallelujah amen glory to God and that's why brother we realize in this hour that we have come to believe in the word of God no matter what David said if he if if he sends me to hell from hell I will worship Him Hallelujah brother bam said if you have that in your heart amen amen if you have that in your heart like David said he said you got something you got something am Hallelujah brother Bram said a man told me I believe you're you're you're preaching Antichrist he said well I told the person this if that's the will of God for my life and that's his will not mine that's his will for my life he says I'm glad serve that purpose brother that's something that's not just talk huh no no no no no you got to have something in there Hallelujah that's something's called predestinated seat you can't deny that word brother Bram said a Son of God that come from his loins and never blaspheme the Holy Ghost amen I don't care where you're at what place what condition even in Hell itself there's something in that Gene that says father amen amen you're Lord you're right amen your word is true hallelujah [Music] hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah hallelujah how I love Jesus why because he first loved me amen hallelujah hallelujah I didn't love him first he loved me first that the Bible amen amen hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh my so we see then that in this hour God's Wrath God's anger is coming Jeremiah's prophesying in verse 12 I will give sentence amen but I want to to save us some time and also at the same time trying to be sensitive to the holy spirit amen amen want to show you by the grace of God how that Jeremiah's prophecy is prophesying of the Judgment of the harot Amen in this case Jerusalem is the Harlot in verse one he is saying return to me is she is found by God in adultery imagine that in the natural this is spiritual this is higher

perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest heart amen and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience amen hallelujah right okay okay let's go back to Jeremiah 4 break up thy fellow ground verse three and so not among Thorns watch what brother bam says in the message expectations our heavenly father with these broken up words a little talk a little talk just to kind of get all fear and starchiness away from your church just to kind of break up the follow ground and to lay a foundation here not to lay a foundation but to build upon the foundation that's already laay Jesus Christ these people has been taught to believe down through the years that Jesus Christ is a Son of God and he's the same yesterday today and forever watch what

pray that you'll open the word and we can read it but it takes you to open our understanding now may our conscience be washed with pure water the Holy Spirit renew our strength and spiritual sight open up our hearts break up the fow ground and move in and plant the seed of an oldfashioned reviv that will start from this meeting throughout and through streetport Louisiana and save the Lost before Jesus come and every time he talks about breaking up the follow ground he's in prayer amen he's in prayer asking God to do this now once the ground is prepared before the seed Falls brother bam said the Earth has to be prepared in the message faith is Works EXP expressed he said the ground preprepared has to be predestinated before the foundation of the world to receive the word for the hour Faith expressed 1965 Port Louisiana the ground in which the seed Falls in has to be preprepared before the foundation of the world by God by predestination to receive the word for this hour not all ground is prepared to receive the seed hallelujah hallelujah and not all ground is in the field where he is sewing it amen amen amen glory to God but the son of man remember the vision of the Prophet when he went amongst the Pentecostals he couldn't understand what was going on there and he said Lord he went up to pray and then the Bible opened by the wind of God to Hebrews 6 amen amen to Hebrews 10 amen amen and he saw the vision of the earth and a man dressed in white going through the whole earth sowing the sea is that right and there was one come behind him after him dressed in black sowing seeds of discrepancy sewing tears amen amen and they and they both grew up amen together and they got dry and they were they were hanging down needing water he says and the terror rised up and it was crying for water and the wheat rose up and was crying for water amen hallelujah and brother bam said in one message I remember this brother bam said and a great Cloud that covered this what the prophet said in his vision covered the whole earth glory to God he says and from all that cloud that covered the whole earth rain began to come forth amen amen amen amen hoseah chapter 6 I sayth the Lord will come to you as the rain amen amen and when that rain come amen what did it do he said it fell upon the tears it fell upon the wheat the tear rose up and begin to worship God hallelujah

revives what the seed is amen does water change the seed no does it change the life of the seed what seed it is if it's a orange seed can the water change it to Lemon no can the water change it to to to to grapefruit or watermelon no the water don't change it the seed is the seed and the seed in this case that that is is being sold is the word the message of the hour amen hallelujah but the ground has to be broken up it's got to be prepared in other words don't cast your Pearl Before Swine in other words this word ain't for all people there's got to be a prepared ground in there that when the seed Falls it will receive it hallelujah hallelujah is that right watch the prophet in the message the spoken word is the what Original Seed brother Adam said Billy Graham Billy gr planted a seed or Roberts or Roberts planted the se he says and there their crops are growing brother that's what people don't understand in the message if the prophet planted Seed where the crops at right here amen

says they're ready for the fires of God's judgment Pentecostals are full soal the same as them but the weak word will be gathered someday after they leave for the Masters but God promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled this is 62 people can twist this quote and make some weird stuff out it I've seen it done before but what they don't understand is the other quote where he said in lean Church age Exposition which they don't even believe in that that's why they don't quote it but he said in the messenger he said there the messenger will do two things one he will restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father two according to Malachi 4 in Revelation 107 he will reveal the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals that's what he said not something outside inside the seven seal he said and it will be that Revelation that will turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers you understand that you understand what I just quoted that Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled when he preaches the seven Thunders this is 1962 the Thunders haven't been preached yet to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father here he says Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled glory to God it is a gerti word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet you know why I hit that right now when I when I read that because I've I've seen that teaching before even at one time I was influenced by it you know why they'll take this quote and they'll throw it away in the future and they would say brother Adam left the scene and he was still an evangelist get next to yourself amen and they'll quote take inside with Jesus and he said I'm not in the office of a prophet I'm an evangelist and I say Amen because that was 19 62 but what people don't understand if they would study the message amen and they would go into the message and really find it out here anointed ones at the end time he said the only office he was speaking of office the only office that can reveal the word the highest office is the prophet and he said said the third pull was the revealing of the Seven Seals yes sir so did he enter into the office of a prophet or not where they get this nonsense from they twist the word to fit their Doctrine and I and I tell you their Doctrine is manmade they make their own Doctrine but when you when you uncover the thing you find out wow that's not the wordu Hallelujah it sounds good it has it has message in it but it ain't the message Hallelujah that's what I was telling a brother down in Mexico amen believe the message according to a tradition that has been taught for years and that's how they follow the message saying and beliefs the pastor preaches you know the return how does he preach it the majority of the people that that believe in a return Ministry don't even know half of what it really means and they're out all outside of the word everywhere why because they believe it traditionally with no understanding with no Revelation amen Amen brother and sister this is not to be followed just because I preach it and because you come to church here and because you're a member of the church and this is what we believe don't don't start that nonsense amen then it becomes a tradition and you're just following because that's that's the thing amen brother Bram was always against that type of thing what seed are we planting brother I pray God always before I come up here don't let me do anything outside of your word let me just stay in your word and be sensitive to your spirit to be able will let your Holy Spirit can Minister amen and that's not for no one's Glory that's for glorifying the word of God because this thing when we when we realize that it's all God how many know that brother Bram said Moses did not create one thing amen how many know that brother Bram said I can show you the quotes mes didn't do one Miracle Moses didn't do nothing it was the angel Christ that did everything but Moses was the man that he was using he took sand threw it up in the air he said fleas come well that's not Moses that's God in Moses inen I have come down I have heard the cries of my people and I have come down has he come down in this age is that the seven seal the coming of the Lord when he come down he says I have come down to deliver my people right to bring them out of that slavery of sin what did Jesus tell the Pharisees amen amen he that the son of man sets free is free indeed if you believe in this you shall be free Pharisees said free from what we're not in bondage we're free look we got got the temple you got the church you got the people here amen free from what Jesus what are you talking about he said he that serves sin is a slave to it God that's the slavery brother that this message come to bring us out of I have come down to deliver my people from slavery but he said mooses you shall be God to the people Aaron shall be your voice Hallelujah and in this hour God come down and he said William Bram will you shall be this word made manifest to the people when the word is veiled in the prophet brother bam said that's not the prophet that's God to the people amen amen and he was also going to have a voice like Aaron and he said the bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final Hallelujah to God that's the same word brother that's the same scene this ain't fantasy this ain't religion this is the word revealed in this hour hallelujah oh my see he says Malachi 4 will be fulfilled it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be fulfilled before that time amen the physical coming of Christ the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives the prophet William Bram William BR but he ain't saying it's me when this anointed messenger arrived of course he says of course look how the prophet talks of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible what seeds he's planting what seeds he's planting part of the word one one seed is the seed of the entire Bible remember the quote that that we use a lot from the sman church age brother Bram said when he's talking about how the message comes to the people he says it's given to the messenger of the age he says then is given to those who are Faithfully taught is that what the prophet said he says and then the light is spread with those who say only what the prophet messenger has said and then after that the prophet says see people have to be blind not to see it because right what he says right after that he says this he says so I have not preach every scripture in the Bible he says but I have point you to key points in the Bible he says so that you by the Holy Spirit can take that and Dove tail the whole entire Bible That's the seat of the entire Bible do you understand say amen amen amen I'm trying to I'm trying to get through here and you're already tired see look he says here of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain he will be rejected by denominational people he will be rejected by denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord amen amen oh brother when we see this we got to realize something Jeremiah is preaching amen he's telling break up your follow ground because I am the prophet that has D say it the Lord and if and if the ground is prepared and ready and they receive this they'll be saved from the Judgment that I'm prophesying amen amen you get iten but if not that judgment is coming anyway now listen to this oh my amen and then he shows from where this is coming from let's go to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 7 amen forgive me this chapter 16 because I told you at the beginning that this is the Judgment of the Harlot revealed in the revelation of the Supreme judge because what I'm showing by the word is that what Jeremiah are you listening what Jeremiah is prophesying in Jeremiah 4 is that this judgment is coming to the amen amen but he he gives he gives specifics of how it's going to come and when it comes he said it's coming from the north what else did he say in Jeremiah 4 he says it will come like a whirlwind what else did he say it will come like a cloud on horses swifter than Eagles he gave all these descriptions listen of the Judgment of the Wrath coming to Jerusalem that's Jeremiah's prophecy you listening amen but when Ezekiel sees of what Jeremiah prophesied he doesn't see it as judgment coming he sees the same thing that Jeremiah prophesied but he sees the glory what is what does Ezekiel see in Ezekiel 1 remember we preached it you're in the study with me and we preach Ezekiel 1 what did did Ezekiel see he saw a whirlwind Ezekiel chapter one right a whirlwind was coming is that right from where Ezekiel 13 from the north hello it's coming from the north a worldwind and then he looks at the Whirlwind it turns into a cloud and then the cloud turns into fire and then the fire is the color of amber and then from there he sees a throne and he sees one sitting on the throne and his voice is as many Waters I'm trying to show you that what Jeremiah is prophesying judgment is coming to Jerusalem amen amen judgment is coming to Jerusalem but when Ezekiel sees he sees that this judgment that's coming is God himself In This Cloud and then he sees closer and he sees the throne he sees the four living creatures he hears the voice as the voice of many Waters did John see the same thing in Revelation chapter one what did John see he saw Christ with the white wing watch the white wiek judge brother bam said that's judgment but in that judgment that has come it's not coming it has come in that judgment the bride like eel sees the glory coming to her amen hallelujah see this is what people don't understand that judgment does not or doesn't stop God from redeeming his people only his people people have a traditional concept that when judgment comes Redemption there's no more calling there's no more nothing that's true but when full judgment comes amen amen amen remember I I showed you the other day that Ezekiel is in the time where it's not completely mercy and is not completely judgment it's between after Mercy has ended the lamb Goes Forth takes the book and that's no longer Mercy seven Church Ages was Mercy full Mercy amen amen tribulation period and on down to the Millennium full judgment but there's an in between after church ages and before Millennium after Son of God and before son of David there's something happening in here and that happening in here is the Throne of mercy and Judgment at the same time amen you say is that scriptural brother that's the message I preached it time and time time but here Jeremiah is showing us prophesying of this judgment coming from the north he said it's a whirlwind he said it's a cloud he said this is Judgment for Jerusalem that has turned into a but when Ezekiel sees it he sees the Whirlwind coming from the north he sees the cloud he sees the glory he sees the throne he sees one sitting on the throne he sees horses swifter than Eagles he sees four living creatures but for him it's Redemption for him is Mercy amen for the denomination is Judgment for Ezekiel it's Grace hallelu the Judgment of the Harlot revealed in the revelation of the Supreme judge what was that white wig Supreme judge in that Revelation it will show you how the Harlot denominational systems will be burned with fire the nation of America of the United States in the seventh vision of the Prophet what did he see Hallelujah did he warn this nation receive Christ this year or you will see the judgments of God and after that what happened brother when that cloud come listen to me he received the revelation of the Seven Seals to call the bride unto Redemption but at the same time that sign where he received that Revelation from at the same time Matthew 2430 yes Matthew 2430 is Judgment at the same time amen amen and a year after that he throws a rock up in the air judgment amen amen prophesize West Coast going down judgment but at the same time he has a message see he's calling judgments but at the same time in that same message in that same glory in that same coming of Christ he's bringing Redemption for his own you understand did not the prophet say this day the scriptures fulfilled he said it come from Heaven as a revelation to me remember that walked into the synagogue and had the scroll of the book of Jeremiah of of Isaiah is that right brother bam said that's a entire Bible 66 chapters 66 books in the Bible amen amen here was the word made flesh having the word written in his hands and this is what people don't understand today it's not that you're that you're doing away what has already happened no is that you're taking the message and you're showing by the message what is now that's the difference amen amen and what did Jesus do with the with the book of Isaiah are you listening to me amen amen what did he do if he had the book of Isaiah and he was Jesus he why didn't he go to Isaiah could he had read Isaiah 6 an everlasting sign a son will be given Isaiah 6 preach a message super out of Isaiah 6 yes sir he could have gone to that scripture but how come he didn't read it because that was already history he had already come about 30 something years ago see even 30 years back was already history he didn't want to open the word and preach something from 30 years ago are you hearing me no no he could have done it but he didn't do knew it he could have gone to Isaiah 96 unto us a son of given his name Shall be Called Eternal Father right amen Mighty God right a virgin shall conceive could Jesus would could could had he had read that scripture yes but he would have been preaching message of 30 something years ago Hallelujah are you getting it and today that's all that ministers do that's all they do yes it's the scripture yes it's true yes it was fulfilled yes but for thee they're blind brother Adam said in the message Satan's Eden he said Satan will allow you to see all that was and all that will be but he will keep your eyes blind to what is now amen amen the angel of the Lord that was with the prophet is still doing something with the message of that Prophet amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus could have easily went to the scriptures of Isaiah he's in the book of Isaiah you think Jesus could have read Isaiah 53 right like a lamb before his shears he was dumb he was wounded for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him here Jesus is at the pulpit in the church and he has the book of Isaiah he can read from all those scriptures could he had read of Isaiah 53 but he if he would have read that he couldn't have have said this day the scripture is fulfilled he would have said this is going to come in the future they're going to take me they're going to crucify me I'm gonna die for you or he could have took the other scriptures that said I was born 30 something years ago to come and save you but he didn't read the past or the future the scripture says in Luke 4 he found the place amen you got to listen to those details of the Bible he found the place where was written of him Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord is upon me and has anointed me to preach the gospel set the captives free to bind the broken hearted oh brother to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and then he stopped right sometimes we read quotes and you don't have to read them from beginning to end if you're intellectual you you have to do it but if you're led by the spirit you can stop right in the middle of the sentence amen amen look at Gabriel when he came to Mary when he came to Elizabeth eleth what did Gabriel quote to Elizabeth Elizabeth the child that will come from your womb will not drink strong drink is that right amen because he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and Gabriel stop right there amen how come he how come Gabriel didn't say and the hearts of the children to the to the fathers because he knew that's for Malachi 4 Jesus stopped right in the middle of the verse it wasn't a a comma there to stop there wasn't a a uh uh uh what do you call period to stop he wasn't looking at grammar he was led on the spirit and he stopped at preaching the acceptable year of the Lord is that right and then the prophet said it's revealed to me that the second part is Judgment he said and brother Bram said this day that second part is fulfilled amen H Allelujah he didn't the son of man didn't come like he did 2,000 years ago he come in Angelic form veiled himself in another body and he said this is Judgment this is the second part for the second coming for the day of the Lord and in that day he will have a white wig in that day he will have seven thund in that day he's not a lamb he's a lion roaring seven thund stand to your feet Ezekiel 16 as the musicians come Ezekiel 16 says I want to read here in scripture can see verse 32 of 16 says but as a wife that committeth adultery was taketh strangers instead of her husband and that what Jeremiah prophesied amen they give gifts to all but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and Hest them that they may come unto thee one every side for thy whoredom the contrary is in thee from other woman and thy whoredoms whereas none followeth thee to commited and that that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou are contrary wherefore I hardly hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God because thy filthiness was poured out in thy naked discovered thy H with thy lovers in all th Idols of thy Abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou Gest unto them look at verse 38 I will judge thee as woman that breakthe loock shed blood are judged I will give thee blood in Fury and jealousy also the into the hand and they shall throw down thine imminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also thy clothes and shall take thy Fair jewels and leave thee naked and Bear they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall Stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords they shall burn the thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many Wom woman I will cause thee to cease from playing the Harlot thou shal give no more hire anymore I shall so will I make my fear toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and I will be Qui because thou H has not remembered thy days of thy youth but has Fred me in all these things behold therefore I will also will recompense thy way upon thine own head sayth the Lord God and thou shalt not commit these less above all thine abomination behold everyone that uses proverb shall use this proverb against thee same as is the mother so is her daughter he's speaking to Jerusalem what's going to happen to Jerusalem because she was in idols and idolatry Jeremiah said th say the Lord return to me right amen and I'll still save you I still love you but I'm prophesying this judgment is coming eel saw that when it came to Jerusalem he was living in that day you understand what I'm saying amen that this Glory that has come to us is revealing the Judgment of the Harlock system if you read this six 16 chapter of e compare it with Revelations 18 you see the exact parallel Ezekiel is telling her you have dressed yourself with all these with gold you have sold children you have done this you have done that you have built high places you have multiplied your Abominations doesn't Revelations 18 say that the Harlot is the mother of all Abominations all of them Ezekiel says you committed adultery with Egypt with with Egypt you committed adultery with the child demons with the philes you committed adultery with all these what does the Bible say about the Harlot she commits fornication with the kings of the earth that's the Bible That's the Revelation but let me let let me ask you something to close this out today who is showing all of that to John an angel but you know what the same angel that reveals to John the Harlock and her judgment what's the haras Judgment according to the law stone with stones Hallelujah burn with fire amen amen and brother Bram said in one hour's time according to the Bible one hour she shall burn brother bam said that's not normal fire huh that's atomic fire Hallelujah is that right that's nuclear someone's gonna drop a bomb on that amen amen is that right Hallelujah you know who that is right does the message reveal that to us amen amen you think Putin's afraid of Obama you think he's afraid of Rome listen to him talk he ain't afraid to know nobody God Rose him up for that purpose amen hallelujah you're going to drop a bomb on Rome and you're going to drop a bomb on us brother bam that was my next quote right there my next quote was the seventh Vision amen what was the seventh major vision of the prophet and I seen the land of America I saw nothing but [Music] debris craters and smoke all over the land of America and I heard the most terrible explosion amen he's going to judge with fire who showed that Vision to the prophet That Glory that same Glory that would reveal to him this is who the bride is look at her March did he had a vision of the Bride who showed him that Vision that same Glory that same one with the white wig showed him the bride beautiful out of all Nations marching Hallelujah getting at a step he said get back in line that same one that showed him the beautiful bride show him the har said it was a witch leading the World Council of churches brother bam said she was causing this is a mixed audience but in other words she didn't need the husband she didn't need man look at denominations that's what that's what they do they don't need the word they don't need the male word to cause them Sensations they have their own Creed they have their own dog and all they have to say is their little their little phrases there amen amen hallelujah and this and thatu you know Pentecost speak in Tong repeat this and that and there they go Sensations without the male what's the male word but brother Ram said the bride has stimulation of what what stimulates us what excites us glory to God if it ain't the word you're in the flesh got to be the word brother even in your worship even in your praise it's got to be the word I'm not saying we don't believe in Sensations but you got to see the source of it why are you doing it hallelujah hallelujah if it ain't the word forget it amen amen and brother and sister he saw this nation burned with fire he saw the Harlock burn with fire he saw burning with fire hallelujah hallelujah but that same Glory that same one that come clothe in a cloud hallelujah hallelujah amen amen judgment does not impede God from redeeming and calling his subjects do you understand that let me just show you real quick under the six seal in Great Tribulation when the most horrible judgment is upon the earth does that stop God from redeeming 144,000 in the time of judgment is he still going to redeem them does redemption stop no he's still redeeming 144,000 calling their names out of the book that same Glory that the world is running from hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne that same one is 144,000 are going to be receiving thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah Blessed Be Your Name Lord hallelujah you see what I'm saying that's full judgment but now there's judgment Hallelujah he has come as judge reveal the Judgment of the Harlot the system is done hallelujah
