[2:22] given it's being
[2:25] preach father let not the
[2:28] enemy
[2:30] take away the seed that is being
[2:34] given let not the cares of
[2:38] Life choke the
[2:42] sea don't let the fowls of the
[2:46] air the the fouls in from the
[2:53] cage from
[2:55] Babylon a cage of every hateful and
[2:58] unclean bird
[3:02] let us be like
[3:04] Abraham this morning
[3:07] Father when the fouls tried to come over
[3:10] the
[3:13] sacrifice he scared them
[3:17] away to not contaminate his
[3:21] sacrifice and your Prophet said that was
[3:24] a type of the
[3:26] church the last
[3:28] days cast Spirits
[3:33] out oh God don't let any foul come and
[3:38] contaminate the
[3:40] word cast them away in the name of Jesus
[3:44] Christ that the pillar of
[3:47] fire might move among
[3:50] us as it did amongst the
[3:54] sacrifice Lord that lamp of
[3:57] fire to vindicate and UNC conditional
[4:01] Covenant oh God you put Abraham to
[4:07] sleep we recognize
[4:10] Lord that when a man is
[4:13] asleep he goes into his
[4:17] subcon not in his conscience
[4:20] anymore but in
[4:22] hisence so father when you come down to
[4:25] vindicate that
[4:28] Covenant with the pillar of fire the
[4:31] quickening
[4:33] power Lord make it so real
[4:37] father that it would be a
[4:40] covenant that it would be something that
[4:42] comes down deep into our subc
[4:48] conscience Lord and that is in the
[4:54] soul not in the first realm Lord or in
[4:57] the second
[4:58] realm
[5:00] but let it go deep down
[5:03] father into the
[5:06] subconscious into the soul into the
[5:09] heart for as a man thinketh in his
[5:13] heart so is
[5:16] he oh father let your
[5:20] word from the abundance of the
[5:23] heart let the mouth speak father Lord we
[5:27] recognize that it is not what goes
[5:30] into our mouths that contaminates
[5:35] us but it is what comes
[5:38] out for if we
[5:41] speak something that is not in our
[5:45] heart then we will be
[5:48] judged for our
[5:50] words Lord let us speak that which you
[5:54] reveal to our
[5:58] hearts speak by
[6:01] Revelation not by head
[6:04] knowledge not by
[6:08] hearing not by just perceiving in the
[6:13] natural father let it be something deep
[6:16] down
[6:17] inside let it be so God oh Father for we
[6:22] know that unconditional
[6:25] Covenant the coven of
[6:28] Grace Lord is upon us in this
[6:32] hour for it's for the Seed of
[6:36] Abraham you believe we are the Royal
[6:39] seed rise us up father from the dust of
[6:44] the
[6:45] Earth to the
[6:47] skies Lord that Seed of
[6:50] Abraham going from the
[6:52] Earth to the to the
[6:55] heavens first as the sand of the
[6:58] sea then as the stars of
[7:02] Heaven let us father rise up
[7:05] God from the
[7:07] dust to the to the
[7:10] star the sons of God in their
[7:15] position help us father for Lord we
[7:18] realize that you set all things in
[7:22] order and if one thing gets out of
[7:25] order Lord it would throw the whole
[7:28] universe
[7:30] into
[7:31] chaos but father it is
[7:35] remaining in its place where you first
[7:38] said it
[7:39] father help us Lord in this
[7:42] hour as we realize that our position in
[7:47] Christ his Heavenly
[7:49] places Lord we are gathered here in

[8:43] morning day to serve the
[8:50] Lord know that he is the contr of all
[8:54] things
[8:56] amen you realize that
[9:00] need more of
[9:02] him less of
[9:04] us that's right our
[9:08] thinking less of our
[9:11] ideas less of what we
[9:15] want more of what he
[9:18] wants is that your desire this
[9:22] morning John
[9:25] 5 ver
[9:28] 24
[9:33] scripture we taken
[9:36] for this subject that we touched on
[9:44] Wednesday and it's a continuation as the
[9:48] Lord is leading and showing us unfolding
[9:51] this these things that in the word of
[9:56] God I believe it is very fitting for the
[9:59] hour that we are living
[10:02] in and we also must realize that this
[10:07] has to be revealed to our hearts and it
[10:09] has to be something that we
[10:16] understand amen has to be by
[10:20] Revelation I believe this is why the
[10:22] holy spirit is uh leading us and
[10:26] continuing in this same line of thought
[10:32] that we can see as the word unfolds
[10:36] itself that it is something that it's
[10:39] deep in the
[10:41] word it goes from Genesis to
[10:45] Revelation there something that is
[10:47] Promised for us in this
[10:49] day so we have to take those promises
[10:52] for
[10:54] us amen by
[10:57] Revelation by faith
[10:59] believe that these things that we are
[11:02] hearing is for us it's not being
[11:07] given for any other
[11:10] reason but that we might
[11:13] understand this
[11:14] Revelation and walk in it by
[11:17] faith
[11:20] amen you want to read St John
[11:23] 5 verse
[11:25] 24 verily verily I say unto you he that
[11:29] heareth my word and believeth on him
[11:31] that sent me hath eternal
[11:35] life which is
[11:37] Zoe and shall not come into
[11:41] condemnation but is pass from Death unto
[11:55] life amen in first Timothy
[12:06] chapter
[12:12] 2 first Timothy chter
[12:21] 2se
[12:25] 5 there is one God one
[12:30] mediator between God and
[12:32] Men the man Christ
[12:41] Jesus amen let's read that
[12:45] again for there is one
[12:47] God and one mediator between God and Men
[12:52] the man Christ
[12:57] Jesus
[12:59] amen and in First
[13:04] Peter First Peter Chapter
[13:13] 3 Verse
[13:17] 18 first Peter
[13:21] 3 Verse
[13:23] 18 for Christ also have once suffered
[13:27] for sins the just for the
[13:30] unjust that he might bring us to God
[13:32] being put to death in the flesh but
[13:36] Quicken by the
[13:49] spirit amen the Lord the blessings to
[13:52] the reading of his
[13:55] word amen you may be
[13:57] seated
[14:04] you want to continue
[14:06] on this subject
[14:09] and if we would open our spiritual ears
[14:13] this
[14:15] morning I believe we can
[14:20] receive something in our hearts that
[14:23] will help
[14:26] us to realize the
[14:29] the grace that we have in
[14:32] God to realize that we have
[14:36] this in our
[14:39] hands not only in our hands but it's
[14:42] here before
[14:44] us we have to recognize
[14:47] this this brother mam spoke to us about
[14:52] recognizing presence of
[14:55] God he also spoke to us about
[14:58] recognizing our
[15:02] day he also spoke to us about
[15:07] recognizing our
[15:09] message
[15:12] amen so it's not just
[15:16] words
[15:17] amen we say we have to
[15:21] realize you have to
[15:24] recognize this is something that is
[15:27] given to us
[15:31] that we might have that
[15:34] desire to understand to realize to
[15:40] recognize and that's that that is where
[15:43] we can receive from
[15:46] God if we
[15:48] hunger if we
[15:51] desire for those things to to be real to
[15:57] us but if if there's no
[16:01] entrance if there is
[16:04] uh no nothing that is available for
[16:08] us to access these
[16:12] things then we can become
[16:16] discouraged we can say well what what is
[16:18] the reason what's the purpose of me even
[16:24] trying but if we
[16:27] hear we see that these things are
[16:32] available it's
[16:34] accessible then we should have that
[16:37] desire in
[16:39] us to say this is
[16:42] possible this is for me
[16:46] amen I can I can as a Son of God I can
[16:50] enter into these
[16:53] promises say I'm living in the day where
[16:57] these things are made available to the
[17:00] church this wasn't made
[17:04] available in this
[17:06] measure in any other
[17:09] time last day right it was given in
[17:13] portions it was given uh to certain
[17:18] individuals it was given for certain
[17:23] purposes now in this last
[17:26] day is given in its
[17:29] fullness and it is given to the whole
[17:31] body of
[17:33] Christ if you're wondering what I'm
[17:35] speaking
[17:37] now what am I getting at is this same
[17:43] thing that we're that we've been
[17:44] speaking
[17:46] on the
[17:48] bridge back into
[17:51] Eden the second
[17:53] part to this
[17:57] message uh
[17:59] in the same line that we've been
[18:01] speaking of that third fold mystery of
[18:06] Christ amen which is the kingdom
[18:10] coming which is the kingdom of
[18:13] God being established in the heart of in
[18:16] in the heart of the
[18:19] Bride which is brother Bram said
[18:21] returning back into the Garden of
[18:25] Eden there's a spiritual fulfillment of
[18:29] that that it has to take and is taking
[18:32] place
[18:34] now amen amen it is something that is
[18:39] invisible that is taking place in this
[18:42] hour amen amen then brother bam shows
[18:46] us that that mystery that third fold
[18:51] mystery will be when Jesus
[18:54] Christ and his bride Revelation 19
[18:59] come back to the Earth fight the battle
[19:02] of
[19:03] Armageddon and come into the
[19:06] Millennium to live a thousand
[19:09] years and Rule and Reign on
[19:12] Earth after this amen the
[19:16] Judgment then to come into the eth
[19:20] day amen amen because that day that was
[19:24] lost in
[19:27] Eden has to be lived
[19:29] again in its
[19:31] fullness upon the Earth but that that
[19:35] will be the literal
[19:37] part we're speaking about the spiritual
[19:40] part we're speaking about the part that
[19:43] is taking place
[19:45] now we're speaking and looking in the
[19:48] promises of
[19:51] God seeing where these things are being
[19:54] fulfilled
[19:55] now where these things are promised to
[19:58] us
[19:59] now and seeing how in our
[20:03] day amen these things were made
[20:07] available so now we we spoke uh
[20:11] Wednesday
[20:13] about this
[20:15] bridge we spoke about how brother Bram
[20:19] showed us that this
[20:22] bridge is Jesus
[20:25] Christ take us back into where man fell
[20:29] from amen this bridge is has been
[20:35] tested it has been
[20:38] built from Genesis to
[20:41] Revelation and it's every word of God
[20:45] it's Jesus Christ
[20:46] himself he is the word Amen brother ra
[20:51] said this bridge is nothing else but
[20:53] almighty
[20:56] God is that right amen we also seen how
[20:59] that Jesus
[21:00] Christ he could not die on the
[21:03] earth or he could not die in
[21:06] heaven he had to die in
[21:09] between because he was hung upon a
[21:13] cross brother bam said because he was
[21:15] the
[21:17] bridge Amen to bridge Heaven and Earth
[21:22] together amen amen that's why we've read
[21:25] the
[21:26] scriptures that we have read this
[21:27] morning
[21:29] we read the same scriptures on
[21:33] Wednesday St John 5 shows
[21:36] us that he that believeth on on me Jesus
[21:41] said
[21:43] amen and believeth on him that sent
[21:47] me heareth my
[21:50] words that's not just hearing with your
[21:53] natural
[21:55] ear amen that it is understanding
[21:58] brother
[21:59] said because to see and to
[22:03] hear to
[22:06] hear is to understand amen amen amen and
[22:11] then he
[22:13] says he has
[22:16] passed from
[22:19] Death life there's been a
[22:24] transition there's been a crossing
[22:26] over from from Death from the side of
[22:30] death into the side of life this is not
[22:34] just any life this is Zoe this is
[22:38] eternal life then Timothy in Paul in the
[22:43] Epistle of Timothy
[22:46] says that there is only one
[22:50] God Amen Hallelujah and there is only
[22:52] one
[22:54] mediator between God and
[22:56] men and that's the man Christ
[23:00] Jesus is that right Hallelujah so this
[23:03] is the
[23:04] bridge between God and
[23:07] man that connects God and man
[23:10] together he is the
[23:12] mediator he one in between right first
[23:16] Peter chter 3
[23:18] says that he suffered In the
[23:21] Flesh he paid for the
[23:24] sins but he was quickened by the spirit
[23:28] to bring us back to
[23:31] God in other words we were
[23:35] alienated we were away from God
[23:37] separated from
[23:39] God but he was going to bring us back to
[23:43] God Amen when we look at that and we
[23:48] realize well you can say that that's
[23:50] very simple brother I I've accepted
[23:55] that I have accepted Jesus as my
[23:59] savior and I've seen the
[24:02] denominations how they put a chasm in
[24:04] the
[24:05] middle and they put the
[24:08] cross as the bridge to cross from one
[24:11] side to the
[24:12] other we're not talking about a
[24:15] denominational
[24:17] idea we're talking the word of the
[24:20] hour and this goes way more
[24:23] deeper than just a simple little
[24:26] thought and this is not about showing
[24:29] how deep we can
[24:33] go but this is to show us the access we
[24:37] have in this
[24:38] house there is an actual
[24:41] bridge that is here and it's before us
[24:46] another thing that the Lord showed us
[24:48] this Wednesday and I'm just refreshing
[24:51] this to
[24:55] us if you remember and we look at at the
[24:59] word how the Lord showed us there and we
[25:02] were reading the quotes in the
[25:06] scriptures how brother Bram shows us
[25:09] that this
[25:12] bridge amen it is not only to take us
[25:16] back into the presence of
[25:20] God not only to take us into the
[25:23] presence but it's also he said amen by
[25:27] the the blood of Jesus
[25:29] Christ puts us back in the
[25:33] position where we are supposed to be as
[25:36] sons of
[25:37] God and if you
[25:40] remember
[25:41] amen how the Holy Spirit spoke to us and
[25:44] we
[25:46] seen that that bridge it's not that you
[25:50] cross it
[25:52] once and say well I've already crossed
[25:55] it hallelujah praise the Lord
[25:58] and I don't have to cross it no
[26:00] more we must understand that we have to
[26:05] cross this
[26:06] bridge every
[26:09] day every day hear me every day we have
[26:15] to confess our
[26:19] sins amen if you're afraid to say
[26:23] sins God bless
[26:25] you because brother
[26:28] every time he would pray he' say forgive
[26:32] our
[26:34] sin you can get all Technical and say
[26:37] well don't sin and this and
[26:40] that amen it's just errors
[26:45] mistakes
[26:47] trespasses but brother bam said in the
[26:49] adoption
[26:51] message The Sinner doesn't
[26:54] sin did you know that adoption
[26:59] The Sinner doesn't
[27:00] sin
[27:02] Hallelujah he is a
[27:06] sinner he said if this Bible is
[27:09] black how how much of it is black just
[27:13] this
[27:14] much this much that's what he said he
[27:17] said it's all black yes amen am and a
[27:21] sinner can't
[27:23] sin because he's a
[27:26] sin all
[27:28] black but where it
[27:30] shows is where it's
[27:32] white that's where it
[27:34] shows you understand
[27:37] amen do we have to confess our
[27:41] sins
[27:44] daily do we have to put it under the
[27:46] blood
[27:48] daily do we have to Die
[27:51] daily amen am do we have to amen find a
[27:56] place
[27:58] in our lives that we are
[28:03] constantly using this
[28:06] bridge to keep us in a
[28:09] place where we are
[28:13] ready for whatever the situation might
[28:18] be if your sins are not under the
[28:23] blood if your sins are not
[28:26] confessed amen you cannot meet the
[28:30] challenge whatever it might
[28:33] be in your daily
[28:35] life you cannot you have no
[28:39] Authority you have no
[28:41] rights amen amen this is why brother mam
[28:45] said we have to
[28:47] realize that what we have been
[28:50] given is so
[28:53] powerful that it keeps us the blood of
[28:56] Jesus Christ
[28:58] doesn't lose its power it only gets
[29:01] stronger and
[29:03] stronger it only makes us hallelujah
[29:07] more
[29:08] clean more strong as the day go
[29:12] by we we have to
[29:14] realize that we have to Die
[29:17] daily we have to
[29:19] repent we have to
[29:21] confess because we are still in this
[29:23] body of
[29:25] Flesh and this is still has a sticky
[29:29] nature until this day
[29:33] comes that our bodies are
[29:36] changed is that right amen so you can
[29:40] try to play Angel with me but that's all
[29:45] right you try to play
[29:48] Angel but we know you're not an
[29:51] angel you're a human
[29:53] being amen amen but there's one thing
[29:58] that we do
[29:59] recognize and that's the blood of Jesus
[30:02] Christ brother bam said my whole makeup
[30:05] is
[30:07] Grace amen amen glory to God all of my
[30:11] makeup is
[30:13] Grace why because that's the only thing
[30:17] that will bring us out to the other
[30:20] side it's by the grace of Jesus
[30:23] Christ it's by the blood of the
[30:25] lamb but we have to to have this so
[30:29] impregnated in our
[30:32] hearts that it we walk in this
[30:35] Revelation it's something simple what
[30:39] brother bam said if it's so simple then
[30:42] how come it isn't working in the
[30:45] church how come we still have hard
[30:48] time when Trials come we don't know what
[30:52] to do you should know what to
[30:54] do perfect faith is a master of all
[30:59] circumstances you should be ready for
[31:02] when those things come but when those
[31:04] things come we find ourselves not ready
[31:08] we find ourselves going in in through
[31:11] through different situations or
[31:15] emotions and we begin to don't
[31:18] know what direction to take we begin to
[31:22] cry out to God but this is the hour
[31:25] where he says don't cry speak
[31:28] in other words you have to be ready you
[31:31] you have to know where you're
[31:32] standing amen because when those things
[31:36] are not
[31:38] confessed when you still have things
[31:40] lingering on
[31:41] you you cannot face the devil you cannot
[31:45] face
[31:46] sickness you cannot face any
[31:50] Temptation no sir you cannot no matter
[31:54] what you try to do you have to confess
[31:58] your sins it got to be under the blood
[32:02] because it's not your
[32:03] righteousness it's his
[32:05] righteousness amen that is the power of
[32:10] walking in that
[32:13] way that is the
[32:16] authority that you will live
[32:20] in because you
[32:22] know that the Bible says if we confess
[32:25] our sins he is faithful to forgive us
[32:29] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[32:32] us of all sin then now what else is it
[32:36] say what else does it say it
[32:39] says we
[32:42] fear amen amen when we
[32:48] pray that our prayer would be
[32:52] answered if our heart condemns
[32:55] us amen
[32:58] amen if our heart condemns us
[33:02] not then we
[33:04] have
[33:07] confidence to come before the Throne of
[33:10] God like Paul says in
[33:12] Hebrews
[33:14] boldly Before the Throne and ask what we
[33:19] have
[33:20] need but if our heart condemns
[33:25] us we don't have that
[33:28] access we don't have that that that that
[33:33] Liberty we feel
[33:35] condemn you might not confess it you
[33:39] might not say it but between you and God
[33:43] he knows and you
[33:46] know amen amen is that right so the
[33:50] thing
[33:52] is to have that that confidence
[33:57] boldness it's got to be under the
[34:00] blood then we can come before
[34:03] God and say Lord you know my
[34:06] situation father I speak it in the name
[34:08] of Jesus
[34:09] Christ is that
[34:12] right and then you can have true
[34:16] Faith amen you're not waiting for God to
[34:20] reply back and a rebuke to
[34:25] you to tell you
[34:27] okay yes but confess this get this right
[34:33] is that right you're not waiting for
[34:36] that amen you're not trying to
[34:39] hide you're not trying to put things
[34:41] under the
[34:43] rug and say oh yeah you know those
[34:45] things will take care for a
[34:46] SI whatever whatever but Lord I need
[34:50] this no you have to take care of those
[34:54] things you have to bring it out
[34:58] like David said even the secret things
[35:02] even the hidden things even the things I
[35:05] don't
[35:06] remember amen amen is that right amen
[35:10] this is the power of walking and living
[35:14] in this
[35:15] way it's something very
[35:17] simple amen but it can go a whole long
[35:21] ways if you if you apply
[35:25] it
[35:27] St John
[35:30] 15 verse 7 if you abide in me my words
[35:34] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[35:36] and it shall be done unto
[35:44] you amen amen you believe that
[35:48] Hallelujah is that a promise for you in
[35:50] the South now what are we speaking on
[35:53] the bridge back into Ed
[35:57] now notice in the message God in
[36:00] Simplicity
[36:03] 1963 Albert ker New
[36:06] Mexico he says the church
[36:08] today we are born sons of
[36:11] God Jesus himself said amen that if the
[36:16] the law
[36:17] called the prophets
[36:21] Gods whom the word of the Lord came
[36:23] to and the word of the Lord comes to the
[36:26] prophets
[36:27] if you call them Gods how will you
[36:29] condemn me that I say I'm the Son of
[36:34] God if the blood of bulls and
[36:37] goats could give power to
[36:40] Moses to go out there by the commission
[36:43] of
[36:44] God stretch forth his rod and say Let
[36:48] There come
[36:49] flies he had the word of God and he
[36:51] spoke that
[36:53] word it become from God's thoughts
[36:58] a word is a thought
[36:59] expressed so then when God thought it
[37:02] put it in
[37:03] Moses and then he spoke it it become a
[37:07] word and Moses turned around and went
[37:09] back and maybe there was not a fly in
[37:11] the
[37:14] country but in an hour from then maybe
[37:17] there was a one green
[37:20] fly and a half an hour there was 10 PBS
[37:24] per square yard
[37:29] what was it it was the creative power
[37:33] the word of God that was spoke by the
[37:35] lips of a moral
[37:37] man God uses man he could have used a
[37:41] son to preach the
[37:43] gospel he could have used the
[37:45] wind but he chose man to preach the
[37:49] gospel now what's the matter with the
[37:53] church today there's something wrong in
[37:56] my opinion we're not coming with that
[38:01] sincerity to the right thing if God
[38:05] listen why is he saying there is
[38:08] something wrong in other words look at
[38:11] Moses under the blood of bus and
[38:15] goats bringing pharaoh and all Egypt and
[38:19] all this th this demonic
[38:22] force that was binding the children of
[38:25] God under bondage look at Moses under
[38:30] the blood of bulls and
[38:31] goats by the commission of God bringing
[38:35] this whole Kingdom Under subjection to
[38:39] the word of God and bringing
[38:41] Deliverance to his people by the word of
[38:45] God bringing things into existence for
[38:48] the purpose of Deliverance not for
[38:52] soul not for something like that for a
[38:56] Purp purp for deliverance to set the
[39:00] captives free isn't Jesus Christ to do
[39:03] the same work to
[39:05] you Hallelujah huj isn't the blood of
[39:07] Jesus Christ more
[39:10] powerful than the blood of bulls and
[39:12] goats then what's wrong with the
[39:15] church when these Powers come against us
[39:20] and we don't know how to bring them into
[39:23] subjection how to bring Deliverance to
[39:27] others not just to ourselves to others
[39:31] am am
[39:36] Hallelujah do you understand he says
[39:39] what's wrong with the
[39:40] church there's something wrong my
[39:44] opinion we're not coming with that
[39:47] sincerity if God could do by the blood
[39:49] of bulls and
[39:51] goats that only covered
[39:54] sin made a for iation for The
[39:58] Sinner but the sin was still
[40:01] there only covered
[40:04] over what can he do by the blood of his
[40:08] son that omit
[40:10] sin amen God has not
[40:14] manufactured but he has created a blood
[40:17] that takes away all sin and Mark 11 24
[40:23] whatsoever you say to this mouth move in
[40:26] don't doubt your
[40:27] heart but believe that what you said
[40:30] will come to pass you hi what you said
[40:34] where's the church at today you don't
[40:38] realize that confessed
[40:41] sin truly confess
[40:44] sin omit
[40:47] sinu listen to what he said listen to
[40:49] what he
[40:50] said and that confessed
[40:54] sin omit sin
[40:57] it builds a
[41:00] bridge across this
[41:03] Castle what does that do it builds a
[41:07] bridge across the castle what
[41:11] Castle the chm that was
[41:14] created when a man and God
[41:18] separated but this confessing our
[41:21] sin it builds a
[41:24] bridge Hallelujah
[41:27] to come back into the presence of his
[41:31] creator and makes him a Son of God he
[41:35] that believeth on me the works that I do
[41:39] shall be do also there you are if you
[41:43] say to this mountain be moved and no
[41:45] doubt in your
[41:47] heart it will come to pass glory to God
[41:51] it's my God revealing himself in
[41:56] humility notice God taking a humble
[42:01] sinner cleansing him by his blood
[42:05] dropping that confess sin into the
[42:08] Goro's breach of the Son of God putting
[42:12] his own life into that man by the
[42:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost then if we
[42:19] have the genuine
[42:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost if we have the
[42:26] genuine
[42:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost then what's
[42:31] wrong with
[42:33] us if Elijah dropped the RO on
[42:38] elishah and he got a double
[42:40] portion Jesus The Works that I do shall
[42:45] you do also and greater than
[42:48] this amen oh brother and in this day if
[42:53] you look at the life of Jesus amen look
[42:56] at his works you can to do that and
[43:00] greater not so much in in healing and
[43:03] deliverance and
[43:06] campaigns but the way he
[43:09] controlled amen the way he dealt with
[43:12] every
[43:13] situation do you understand the way he
[43:17] Lov the way he acted the way he was in
[43:21] harmony with the Father the same Harmony

[44:33] thoughts just look at how he

[44:54] things his life look at the
[44:59] Simplicity how he
[45:01] walked how he prayed he never said did

[54:00] day of judgment where his eternal
[54:04] destination will be thrown into the Lake

[1:00:07] spoke and even things created by the
[1:00:11] word if he did that under the blood of
[1:00:13] bulls and
[1:00:16] goats what about the blood of
[1:00:19] Jesus not covered it but remitted
[1:00:23] it you stand in the presence of
[1:00:26] God as a son
[1:00:30] redeemed of God the church is far beyond
[1:00:35] its standard of
[1:00:40] living I think too many
[1:00:42] times we're
[1:00:45] probing instead of really coming out and
[1:00:48] feing the
[1:00:51] issue I've got something I want to say
[1:00:55] and I will after a
[1:00:56] while see he said the reason why is that
[1:01:00] we're just
[1:01:02] probing amen we're not really coming out
[1:01:04] and facing the
[1:01:08] issue why because when there are still
[1:01:11] things in your
[1:01:12] life that are not taken care of you
[1:01:16] can't come with that
[1:01:17] b you can't come with that with that
[1:01:21] Faith amen with that confidence
[1:01:25] is that
[1:01:26] right know there's something there
[1:01:29] doesn't let you amen but when those
[1:01:32] things are confess when those things are
[1:01:34] under the blood there's nothing that can
[1:01:37] hold you back and you have the
[1:01:39] confidence that you in communion with
[1:01:42] God hallelujah and you can stand there
[1:01:45] as a Son of God and say I I speak this I
[1:01:50] ask this I declare this in the name of
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ
[1:01:55] do you understand Church you understand
[1:01:58] what the Lord is trying to show
[1:02:00] us amen what is this bridge back into
[1:02:04] Eden amen hallelujah hallelujah it's the
[1:02:08] word it's
[1:02:10] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:02:12] light is that right and the blood of
[1:02:15] Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ cleanses us from all sin when
[1:02:21] when you walk in the
[1:02:23] light and what is the light it's the
[1:02:26] word of the
[1:02:28] hour in the blood of Jesus
[1:02:33] christes Hallelujah is that
[1:02:37] right is
[1:02:40] right yes sir what ises the Bible saying
[1:02:44] if we walk in the
[1:02:45] light as he is in the light then what
[1:02:49] what happens we just keep walking yes
[1:02:53] but there's something taking place the
[1:02:56] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us of all
[1:03:00] sin you see where the bridges at amen
[1:03:04] this ain't some denominational thing
[1:03:07] where somebody says oh I raise my hand I
[1:03:09] accept Jesus
[1:03:10] yes that's right but there's more than
[1:03:14] that you ain't crossing the
[1:03:17] bridge just by saying you believe in
[1:03:19] Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ no sir the Devils believe
[1:03:25] and they tremble and they ain't Crossing
[1:03:27] no Bridge
[1:03:31] brother you've crossed the bridge now
[1:03:34] let me draw it for you pretty little
[1:03:39] thing you've crossed now you you you
[1:03:43] have entrance to
[1:03:47] Heaven they're still on the other
[1:03:51] side they're still on that other side
[1:03:54] they haven't crossed
[1:03:56] nothing you see what I'm
[1:03:59] saying brother this
[1:04:01] bridge is the word of the
[1:04:06] hour amen amen hallelujah
[1:04:11] notice this is
[1:04:13] why we have to
[1:04:16] understand in the first seal brother
[1:04:19] Bram said the Bride of every age was
[1:04:23] sealed
[1:04:25] because she received all the light for
[1:04:28] her
[1:04:31] day I said they will raise at the
[1:04:36] resurrection I have something I want to
[1:04:38] get to in this in this
[1:04:41] message because God needs a bridge on
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:45] earth for the
[1:04:47] resurrection hallelujah
[1:04:50] amen hallelujah that's right and then we
[1:04:54] meet him in the
[1:04:56] air
[1:04:58] Lord he needs a bridge on the
[1:05:01] earth he needs a a living
[1:05:05] bre hallelujah hallelujah amen right but
[1:05:10] you notice the dead in Christ will
[1:05:13] rise but notice this brother bam
[1:05:17] said
[1:05:19] foolish hear
[1:05:22] me Hallelujah veral and questions and
[1:05:26] answers
[1:05:28] also he said the foolish
[1:05:31] virgin was
[1:05:34] actually not under the
[1:05:37] blood amen first he said she wasn't
[1:05:40] under
[1:05:45] the he said that's
[1:05:48] why she has to go through the
[1:05:53] tribulation amen she has to go through
[1:05:55] the
[1:05:56] tribulation for what what is the six
[1:06:00] seal what is the six
[1:06:02] seal anybody heard
[1:06:07] read what's the
[1:06:11] purpose what does it do purchas the
[1:06:15] Earth is that right purchase
[1:06:21] 144,000 purchase the foolish vir
[1:06:25] why does she have to be
[1:06:27] purged cuz she's not purged right
[1:06:34] now you
[1:06:37] understand you say oh it's simple
[1:06:39] brother the blood is
[1:06:44] simple it's so
[1:06:46] ABC always believe
[1:06:49] Christ that only the bride is under the
[1:06:53] blood
[1:06:54] amen that's
[1:06:57] ABC only the bride is under the
[1:07:02] blood amen you
[1:07:09] understand it goes It goes more than
[1:07:12] just just the
[1:07:15] thought brother bam said it goes deeper
[1:07:19] than what's on the
[1:07:22] line
[1:07:25] amen yeah Hallelujah
[1:07:30] Hallelujah that's why he
[1:07:33] says the bride doesn't go through the
[1:07:37] tribulation why because he already paid
[1:07:42] for it at the
[1:07:44] prop she doesn't have to go through
[1:07:48] suffering and death and
[1:07:51] pain and
[1:07:52] tribulation because he already paid for
[1:07:55] it on the cross and she's under
[1:08:03] that you say then everybody else
[1:08:07] isn't in a in a
[1:08:09] way the foolish virgin amen she's a
[1:08:14] virgin she's pure
[1:08:17] because she lives a
[1:08:22] life see and the word
[1:08:26] sanctifies see but to be truly under the
[1:08:31] blood thism that we're talking
[1:08:34] about it's more than
[1:08:37] that amen now notice
[1:08:41] then this is why brother bam said the
[1:08:45] message fundamental foundation for
[1:08:49] faith faith now why why are we going to
[1:08:53] touch on this Faith right
[1:08:56] here because it has to be revealed and
[1:09:00] faith is a
[1:09:02] revelation you have to have faith in
[1:09:05] what God has given you to take and
[1:09:09] access and move in that walk in
[1:09:13] that let me read you something so you
[1:09:16] can
[1:09:17] understand in the message the presence
[1:09:20] of
[1:09:21] God
[1:09:22] unrecognized brother bam
[1:09:26] says in this day that we are
[1:09:28] living the the church amen is getting
[1:09:34] slothful the church is getting
[1:09:38] worldly the church is so
[1:09:43] indifferent amen amen and their minds
[1:09:46] are so muddled
[1:09:51] up amen amen with with all kinds of
[1:09:55] things
[1:09:56] right and some old
[1:09:59] things and staying
[1:10:02] home that shows where the people's
[1:10:04] hearts
[1:10:06] are now you can tell them
[1:10:09] things that are wrong and they'll they
[1:10:13] think you're
[1:10:15] crazy what is it it's the love of
[1:10:17] pleasure more than lovers of
[1:10:21] God the greatest pleasure that I know
[1:10:26] of is to be to pray until I can realize
[1:10:30] that I'm in the presence of
[1:10:33] God and I think that ought to be a
[1:10:35] thrill of the
[1:10:38] church a presence of the Holy
[1:10:41] Spirit seeing that God made the
[1:10:44] promise standing among us feel his
[1:10:48] presence and see his word and see it
[1:10:52] Vindicated
[1:10:54] it ought to give faith it ought to make
[1:10:57] cripples
[1:10:58] walk the blind see the deaf hear the
[1:11:01] dumb
[1:11:06] speak I stood in South
[1:11:09] Africa where I had 2,000
[1:11:13] people in the Duran trap R
[1:11:21] in and there
[1:11:24] I was explaining to them just in a mild
[1:11:29] form
[1:11:31] amen and they seen one thing take
[1:11:35] place and of that
[1:11:38] revealed 25,000 people was instantly
[1:11:44] healed when they seen that
[1:11:48] Revelation they taken seven van
[1:11:52] loads truck
[1:11:55] see 18
[1:11:57] wheelers P full of old
[1:12:01] crutches heathens Hallelujah that didn't
[1:12:04] even know which was right from
[1:12:07] wrong right hand from Left
[1:12:10] Hand
[1:12:12] see why they
[1:12:15] recognized that the god of
[1:12:17] Heaven had appeared before them in the
[1:12:21] form of his word and we intellectual
[1:12:26] Americans just sit
[1:12:29] there they'll raise in the day of
[1:12:32] judgment and condemn this
[1:12:35] generation for what they've seen it
[1:12:39] reminds of a woman in Louisville
[1:12:41] Kentucky not long ago had a baby walking
[1:12:45] around in a tips
[1:12:48] store and she was doing little things
[1:12:50] trying to get this baby to notice it
[1:12:55] and the little baby just keep
[1:12:57] staring finally she picked up the
[1:13:01] bail anything to attract the attention
[1:13:03] of the little
[1:13:05] fellow and she shook the Bell and the
[1:13:08] little fellow just
[1:13:10] stared and she began to scream and fell
[1:13:13] over some of the people come to help
[1:13:16] her and she said oh no oh no it can't be
[1:13:19] it can't be what's the matter said the
[1:13:23] doctor said the baby was better she said
[1:13:27] what's the matter with with the baby
[1:13:30] lady it took a spell about six months
[1:13:34] ago it just sits and
[1:13:37] stars no matter what it is that ought to
[1:13:40] attract the attention of the baby it
[1:13:44] won't attract its attention all it does
[1:13:47] is just sitting stare the doctor told me
[1:13:51] it was better but I brought it down here
[1:13:54] to pick up little
[1:13:56] gadgets and ought to attract the
[1:13:58] attention of a
[1:13:59] child and it doesn't he just still sits
[1:14:03] and
[1:14:04] stars that's the way the church is
[1:14:07] getting God shook every
[1:14:10] promise before that's in the Bible
[1:14:13] before them and still they just sit and
[1:14:16] still and they say Show Me A Sign while
[1:14:21] while the presence of God
[1:14:24] is all around them it's in the place it
[1:14:28] to illuminate us when God let a promise
[1:14:32] and that promise is Vindicated when it
[1:14:35] comes by
[1:14:37] Revelation Jesus had the Messi sign but
[1:14:41] yet they wanted a sign yet they wanted
[1:14:44] something else but that was the very sh
[1:14:49] the word in him was the sign
[1:14:55] it wasn't in them to
[1:14:56] believe they just sat and
[1:14:59] stared they couldn't eyes where the
[1:15:03] presence of God
[1:15:05] was Hallelujah listen to this and when
[1:15:10] he is not
[1:15:13] recognized his power is not revealed am
[1:15:17] hallelujah amen amen that's
[1:15:22] true the preacher isn't bring the
[1:15:25] Revival the Revival is supposed to be in
[1:15:28] the people

[1:15:33] supposed to be in your home supposed to
[1:15:35] be in

[1:15:44] up Hallelujah I'm pulling on the word so
[1:15:48] that the word can flow amen maybe I'm
[1:15:52] not your
[1:15:54] preacher but it's still the word of
[1:15:59] godu oh yes I like that oh I like this
[1:16:05] but I don't like that it's all the
[1:16:11] word and it's for a purpose that we
[1:16:15] realize that this thing can't go
[1:16:19] on if we don't get in line with the word
[1:16:22] of God
[1:16:24] if we don't change our
[1:16:26] attitude amen hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:16:29] my instead of trying to recognize his
[1:16:34] presence we want people to recognize
[1:16:38] us am oh recognize me I I I did this and
[1:16:44] I did that and I'm doing this and I'm
[1:16:48] doing this brother we to
[1:16:51] recognize what he is doing
[1:16:54] not what I'm doing not what you're doing
[1:16:57] what he is
[1:17:01] doing Hallelujah this is a this is an
[1:17:04] age when when anybody there anything
[1:17:09] they want people to see what they
[1:17:14] did I did this look at me I did that you
[1:17:18] see that's what I did that's what I did
[1:17:20] right there you see I did
[1:17:28] say
[1:17:29] Amen oh my someone put a someone put a
[1:17:34] screw in the in the hinge of the
[1:17:36] bathroom
[1:17:40] door I did it brother take me a
[1:17:44] picture I put the screw in
[1:17:46] there nobody knows me nobody
[1:17:49] acknowledges
[1:17:51] me nobody cares
[1:17:55] nobody
[1:17:56] sees you see what I'm saying we're to
[1:17:59] recognize
[1:18:01] him say when you do something do it for
[1:18:04] the glory of
[1:18:10] God Amen that's the reason why we have
[1:18:15] to
[1:18:16] recognize
[1:18:17] amen his
[1:18:20] presence not my presence not your
[1:18:27] presence when he is not
[1:18:31] recognized his
[1:18:33] power is not
[1:18:36] revealed when he is not
[1:18:39] recognized listen to this when he is not
[1:18:45] recognized no matter how much
[1:18:48] God Is Standing
[1:18:51] present
[1:18:53] you've got to believe
[1:18:55] it
[1:18:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:00] hallelujah you say then how come
[1:19:04] sometimes the
[1:19:07] services I just it's more power and I
[1:19:10] just feel
[1:19:12] it and then there's
[1:19:17] sometimes it's your faith
[1:19:20] it's Amen it's what you re
[1:19:27] because when you're hearing the
[1:19:29] word amen that's why
[1:19:34] continually
[1:19:36] amen amen the word has to be said in a
[1:19:39] certain
[1:19:42] way
[1:19:44] because people begin to to think and
[1:19:48] they begin
[1:19:50] to and begin to go and read
[1:19:55] reason things begin to
[1:19:58] move and that creates the
[1:20:03] atmosphere amen amen amen but when in
[1:20:08] people don't like instruction you ever
[1:20:09] notic
[1:20:12] that you ever notice that they don't
[1:20:15] like
[1:20:18] instruction
[1:20:21] instru when when there's got to be
[1:20:24] something
[1:20:25] done right we we have to do this let me
[1:20:29] give you the
[1:20:30] instructions how many read the
[1:20:32] instructions when you're going to do
[1:20:38] something you don't like
[1:20:42] instructions you buy
[1:20:45] something amen amen and it has a little
[1:20:48] instruction
[1:20:49] manual right it shows you how to build
[1:20:52] it
[1:20:58] I don't like the
[1:20:59] instructions and then you're over
[1:21:06] here you get mad you get
[1:21:10] frustrated read the
[1:21:15] instru right read the
[1:21:21] instructions is that right
[1:21:26] when it comes to
[1:21:28] instructions people think
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:33] this brother look at the
[1:21:37] word recognize his
[1:21:39] presence what are the
[1:21:42] instructions amen is it to show me who I
[1:21:47] am is it to show me how to
[1:21:50] walk how to be closer to God
[1:21:53] amen look at the reason why the
[1:21:56] instructions are being
[1:21:59] given don't just look at the fact that
[1:22:01] instructions are being
[1:22:06] given amen
[1:22:11] amen but I I've
[1:22:13] noticed especially when we get into
[1:22:17] teaching and different things that we
[1:22:20] have to teach
[1:22:23] that are in the message of
[1:22:25] God in the word to instruct us to show
[1:22:31] us how to walk in different
[1:22:33] things you have always noticed that that
[1:22:37] when instructions being given it's
[1:22:39] always
[1:22:41] harder the atmosphere is always
[1:22:45] harder it's a whole lot easier when it's
[1:22:47] just
[1:22:49] preaching amen you're preaching you're
[1:22:52] preaching
[1:22:53] said it's a different
[1:22:56] anointing but when instruction is being
[1:22:58] given it's harder it's harder to pay
[1:23:02] attention it's harder to
[1:23:05] receive because we don't like
[1:23:11] instruction amen hallelujah
[1:23:15] amen and that's the thing we we we we
[1:23:18] have to have enough
[1:23:20] maturity to understand
[1:23:24] amen that these
[1:23:26] things that God
[1:23:29] does is to show us
[1:23:34] instructors and it's our
[1:23:36] attitude it's our
[1:23:38] faith is the fact that we
[1:23:43] realize and
[1:23:46] recognize that that's the presence of
[1:23:48] God when the greats came to
[1:23:51] Jesus he says show us the sign brother
[1:23:55] he was the sign in he
[1:23:57] fles the word in him was the
[1:24:01] sign
[1:24:05] amall we want to see
[1:24:07] something what's going
[1:24:10] on where's the sign
[1:24:14] at I'm the sign Jesus said I'm the
[1:24:19] sign amen why because the word was in
[1:24:22] him
[1:24:23] and what's the
[1:24:26] secret what did Brother say the word is
[1:24:30] in
[1:24:31] the Hallelujah that's the secret
[1:24:38] am you understand now notice then he
[1:24:41] says he says he gives an example he says
[1:24:45] it's like a woman with the blood issue
[1:24:49] all them people passing by all of them
[1:24:52] stand standing up and and and there goes
[1:24:55] the rabbi that's the guy that claims
[1:24:58] he's a
[1:24:59] prophet he's a fanatic but what happened
[1:25:03] the little woman with the blood
[1:25:06] issue she had heard about
[1:25:09] it and when she come down there
[1:25:11] regardless of what anybody
[1:25:14] said she
[1:25:16] recognized who he was and she said if I
[1:25:19] can only touch His Garment
[1:25:23] and when genuine faith in God become a
[1:25:27] positive thing to her what did it do it
[1:25:31] released the power to
[1:25:34] heal that was in
[1:25:37] Jesus
[1:25:39] amenu brother said sometimes God used
[1:25:44] the
[1:25:45] gift amen amen is that right amen
[1:25:49] sometimes God would use the gift in
[1:25:52] Jesus
[1:25:53] J he said then
[1:25:56] sometimes the
[1:25:58] people would pull it out because they
[1:26:01] would see there's something in there
[1:26:04] that I can
[1:26:06] benefit from God through this
[1:26:10] channel you
[1:26:12] understand look at this
[1:26:14] brother this is powerful he says now he

[1:33:02] blood is got to come into our
[1:33:08] heart is that
[1:33:11] right we have to
[1:33:13] recognize his
[1:33:16] presence if we could only
[1:33:18] realize that he is in these meetings
[1:33:22] for one purpose to
[1:33:25] release our
[1:33:28] desires that we have in him but we've
[1:33:32] got to recognize his
[1:33:38] presence how do you recognize it when
[1:33:42] his promised
[1:33:43] word for this age is made
[1:33:49] manifest not the promise word for Moses
[1:33:54] age or any other Age The Promised word
[1:33:58] for this
[1:34:00] age let me say that again that's analing
[1:34:05] statement where he is not
[1:34:08] recognized his power is not
[1:34:13] revealed
[1:34:14] Hallelujah where he is not
[1:34:17] recognized his power is not recognized
[1:34:22] is not
[1:34:27] revealed notice the message
[1:34:31] who he said
[1:34:33] Revelation is
[1:34:36] Sovereign am amen Lord
[1:34:41] Revelation
[1:34:44] isign Hallelujah he gives it to who he
[1:34:49] will amen amen notice this it's not him
[1:34:54] that
[1:34:55] willth him that
[1:34:57] runneth but God his
[1:35:01] predestination he could choose before
[1:35:03] any
[1:35:04] time God is Sovereign in his
[1:35:07] choosing do you know that God is
[1:35:10] Sovereign who was back there to tell
[1:35:13] him a better way to make the
[1:35:16] world to tell him that he's running his
[1:35:18] business
[1:35:20] wrong the very word
[1:35:23] itself is Sovereign even the
[1:35:28] Revelation is
[1:35:29] sov he reveals to whom he will
[1:35:34] reveal the very Revelation
[1:35:37] itself is Sovereign in
[1:35:40] God that's how people bound at
[1:35:46] things and jump at
[1:35:48] things and hit on things
[1:35:52] not
[1:35:52] knowing what they're
[1:35:55] doing in other words they want to get
[1:35:58] something out of
[1:35:59] God so they try this and they try that
[1:36:04] and they try this and nothing
[1:36:09] works the only way brother that that
[1:36:12] bridge is open to
[1:36:14] you is by
[1:36:17] Revelation it's not how much you try
[1:36:23] Is What You Do by
[1:36:25] Revelation that's what
[1:36:28] counts and
[1:36:31] Revelation
[1:36:32] is that's why brother Bram said in the
[1:36:34] token
[1:36:36] message Lord let me have it right here
[1:36:41] let me
[1:36:44] speak what's revealed to
[1:36:47] me hallelujah it's the token that's the
[1:36:53] required I can only
[1:36:56] speak what the token
[1:36:58] is I can only speak the truth what's
[1:37:03] inside I can only speak what I see what
[1:37:08] I hear what's revealed to
[1:37:11] me that's what I
[1:37:15] speak so if it's not a
[1:37:20] revelation
[1:37:22] it's not sovereignly given to
[1:37:25] you then you can't speak
[1:37:30] it you can quote it you can refer to
[1:37:37] it but to speak it as that word in you
[1:37:42] to come to
[1:37:44] pass it can't be
[1:37:46] done because it's not in you
[1:37:49] see but when it's revealed to you
[1:37:51] you that gate gives you the
[1:37:54] access that opens that that channel that
[1:37:58] wave so that that word or that whatever
[1:38:03] promise can come and
[1:38:05] pass see am now notice this this is why
[1:38:10] brother BR
[1:38:11] said a fundamental foundation for
[1:38:14] Faith he said faith is an unconscious
[1:38:19] thing amen
[1:38:22] real
[1:38:23] Faith you're
[1:38:27] unconscious
[1:38:29] Hallelujah you don't
[1:38:32] know that faith that you've
[1:38:39] got
[1:38:40] amen you're not conscious of
[1:38:46] it
[1:38:48] hallelujah
[1:38:50] hallelujah conscience
[1:38:53] man could you imagine
[1:38:57] Jesus
[1:38:59] questioning whether he had
[1:39:02] Faith or not to stop the
[1:39:07] winds amen did Jesus have to
[1:39:11] do something
[1:39:15] extra to to to to grow and get
[1:39:20] stronger
[1:39:21] in order that he could speak to the
[1:39:26] winds that's how we think
[1:39:29] sometimes we think
[1:39:32] that we can't do it
[1:39:35] now but you know as we
[1:39:38] grow we'll come to the
[1:39:40] place where we can do
[1:39:46] it
[1:39:50] amen but it's already there it's
[1:39:53] unconscious if you've got the Holy
[1:39:56] Ghost and the blood's been applied to
[1:39:58] your
[1:39:59] soul and the life of that blood has
[1:40:03] puten you inside by the true baptism of
[1:40:06] the Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost only those that have the baptism
[1:40:10] of the Holy Ghost will go in the
[1:40:14] Rapture
[1:40:16] Hallelujah you say amen amen hallelujah
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:23] no one else is
[1:40:24] going amen now there's there's teachings
[1:40:28] manmade
[1:40:29] ideas where they try to
[1:40:31] twist the things brother Bram said to
[1:40:35] make it seem that you can have the
[1:40:36] baptism of the Holy
[1:40:39] Ghost and not go in the Rapture and then
[1:40:43] they even go as far to
[1:40:45] say that the foolish
[1:40:47] virgin had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:51] but they didn't have their
[1:40:54] Doctrine so because they didn't have
[1:40:56] their
[1:40:57] Doctrine they can't go in the
[1:40:59] rap they don't say that like I said but
[1:41:04] that's the way they
[1:41:06] teach but brother bam very plain very
[1:41:10] clear
[1:41:12] only the seed of
[1:41:16] God Only The predestinated Seed of God
[1:41:22] be
[1:41:24] reborn
[1:41:26] Hallelujah only the
[1:41:34] bride he never said
[1:41:36] anything about anything else having it
[1:41:39] and then not going and this and you need
[1:41:41] some kind of
[1:41:44] creed that only goes filled with this
[1:41:47] Holy
[1:41:49] Ghost we go in that
[1:41:54] am you understand now notice when that
[1:41:58] is in you brother it's already in you
[1:42:02] it's in it's
[1:42:03] unconscious Jesus never stopped to
[1:42:06] question whether he had Faith to stop
[1:42:08] the
[1:42:11] winds to steal the
[1:42:13] waves or have enough Faith to raise up
[1:42:18] Lazarus he never questioned his faith
[1:42:21] the first thing before we can have
[1:42:23] faith we've got to have some foundation
[1:42:26] for
[1:42:27] Faith that's start to be something
[1:42:29] behind
[1:42:30] it when um when man when he chooses his
[1:42:35] life's
[1:42:37] companion he usually requires of her
[1:42:41] life and so forth inquires about her
[1:42:44] life and what her family what her
[1:42:48] background is we have to have
[1:42:51] something to have a
[1:42:53] basis and you ask her only thing you can
[1:42:57] take is her
[1:42:59] word that's all he can take all that she
[1:43:02] can take from him is his
[1:43:05] word I'm so glad that God has placed it
[1:43:08] in that
[1:43:09] way a man taking his wife us taking
[1:43:13] Christ as the
[1:43:15] bridegroom him taking us as the
[1:43:18] bride we just have to base it upon the
[1:43:22] what are we
[1:43:24] anyhow did you ever think about those
[1:43:27] things along those lines what are we
[1:43:30] here for we are human beings what made
[1:43:33] us human beings what made us different
[1:43:36] from everything else in the
[1:43:37] world as human beings no matter what
[1:43:41] state a man's
[1:43:43] in he's yet a Son of God no matter how
[1:43:47] sinful he is how far away he is
[1:43:51] he's still a fallen
[1:43:53] son God is his Creator God is his
[1:43:56] maker God has brought bought him with
[1:43:58] the
[1:43:59] price that he has never reconciled
[1:44:02] himself to
[1:44:04] that he may never accept it he may never
[1:44:08] do it it may never do him any good but
[1:44:11] yet God did it for him and he's a son
[1:44:15] and a daughter of God what God put man
[1:44:18] here
[1:44:19] for we could spend much time on these
[1:44:22] thoughts but just to give a a a basic
[1:44:27] thought God when he made man in the
[1:44:30] beginning he made him
[1:44:32] Superior to anything on the earth he
[1:44:35] gave him
[1:44:36] jurisdiction to everything on the earth
[1:44:39] to control everything he controlled the
[1:44:41] fouls and the fishes and the winds and
[1:44:43] the
[1:44:45] plants man was made a secondary
[1:44:48] God he was given power
[1:44:51] to control the
[1:44:52] elements amen Adam was given these great
[1:44:56] Powers but when the
[1:44:58] power that he was given to make
[1:45:02] himself in other words to make more like
[1:45:06] him Hallelujah when he was given the
[1:45:09] power to make
[1:45:11] himself is where he fell Adam could
[1:45:15] speak to the
[1:45:16] winds he could stop he could speak to
[1:45:18] the
[1:45:19] trees they obey him he could speak to
[1:45:22] the
[1:45:23] wildli he could speak to the waters
[1:45:26] everything obey
[1:45:27] Adam in the beginning of man see that's
[1:45:31] what God gave him power
[1:45:33] over though through the
[1:45:36] fall through the fall he lost that power
[1:45:40] and he becomes
[1:45:43] unconscience of the fact that after
[1:45:46] losing his
[1:45:48] relationship and his friendship
[1:45:51] and
[1:45:52] fellowship with the father amen he lost
[1:45:56] that and all of his great
[1:45:58] channels had become clogged up he
[1:46:01] couldn't get through that Adam was in
[1:46:06] God but what Adam was in
[1:46:10] God Christ Christ has redeemed us back
[1:46:15] to that back to that same
[1:46:19] condition a redeemer to redeem anything
[1:46:24] is to bring back to its original
[1:46:28] again Adam never had to be
[1:46:32] sick Hallelujah he never had to die he
[1:46:36] never had to
[1:46:37] worry he never had to have a
[1:46:40] headache he never had to
[1:46:43] fear he just climb up in the arms of the
[1:46:47] father like a child everything was his
[1:46:52] whatever he asked for he got everything
[1:46:56] obeyed him he was God's child and a
[1:47:01] child is the
[1:47:02] heir of all things but when man fell he
[1:47:07] lost
[1:47:08] this and what he
[1:47:11] lost Christ as a
[1:47:14] redeemer did you ever stop and think
[1:47:18] what Christ redeemed us for he gave us
[1:47:21] everlasting life he brought us back he
[1:47:25] brought us back to God to the Eternal
[1:47:29] fellowship and relationship to God He
[1:47:33] restored back all that Autumn
[1:47:37] lost and since he has
[1:47:40] restored man to his place man in the
[1:47:44] fall lost the
[1:47:47] consciousness of what the father put him
[1:47:49] on Earth to do
[1:47:52] his faith all his things have been
[1:47:55] clogged
[1:47:56] up now notice he says if
[1:48:01] Satan can make his
[1:48:03] power work make his laws
[1:48:08] work in a in the human body in the human
[1:48:13] life see by Satan by his
[1:48:17] laws sin and death makes everything that
[1:48:22] sin and death brought
[1:48:25] operate to Satan is that right when he
[1:48:29] sends
[1:48:31] something man
[1:48:36] recognizes how many recognize this a
[1:48:39] head all the time all the time when you
[1:48:43] see your child getting
[1:48:45] sick do you
[1:48:47] recognize she's getting sick
[1:48:52] oh yeah hello somebody yes when you're
[1:48:55] getting sick do you recognize you're
[1:48:59] getting
[1:49:01] sick when you feel PID do you recognize
[1:49:06] I feel
[1:49:09] pain but he sends
[1:49:11] doubt and fear you
[1:49:14] recognize that presence that
[1:49:18] feeling amen
[1:49:22] if
[1:49:23] Satan by his laws can he he
[1:49:27] says sin and death makes everything that
[1:49:32] sin and death
[1:49:33] brought operate to Satan he sends
[1:49:39] cancer and man recognizes it and
[1:49:43] receives
[1:49:44] it Satan sins
[1:49:48] headaches we recognize it and
[1:49:54] receive what are we talking about
[1:49:57] wherever God is not
[1:50:00] recognized wherever his presence is not
[1:50:03] recognized his power is not
[1:50:07] revealed I can preach for five
[1:50:10] hours it won't do you any good until you
[1:50:14] recognize who's in our
[1:50:19] mid amen amen amen see Satan sends
[1:50:25] headaches we recognize it and we receive
[1:50:28] it if Satan by his
[1:50:31] power can make his laws work in a
[1:50:34] man how much more up god with his
[1:50:38] power make his laws work in a
[1:50:41] man amen amen if Satan can make his
[1:50:45] laws and we're
[1:50:47] sure and recognize
[1:50:51] oh yeah I know this is a
[1:50:53] headache you can't tell me I don't got a
[1:50:57] headache I know what a headache is I had
[1:51:00] a lot of them and I know what it is I
[1:51:05] reckon
[1:51:09] a amen see how much
[1:51:13] more the children of
[1:51:16] God ought to make his laws be
[1:51:20] recognized among his people Divine
[1:51:24] Healing
[1:51:26] Revelation power givs
[1:51:30] manifestations of the spirit the law of
[1:51:33] sin and death works in the people but
[1:51:36] the law of
[1:51:37] Liberty of Christ has come unto us to
[1:51:41] set us free what is brother man talking
[1:51:44] about since Adam fell in the Garden of
[1:51:48] Eden we have lost it the
[1:51:51] Consciousness but Christ has redeemed us
[1:51:54] back that bridge brings us back into
[1:51:58] that presence to bring it from the soul
[1:52:02] to your

[1:58:09] a
[1:58:10] law amen am and that law is not keeping
[1:58:13] a bunch of
[1:58:17] Commandments amen amen amen I've heard
[1:58:20] Brothers quot this
[1:58:22] book it says controlled by a
[1:58:25] law in other words then they go on and
[1:58:28] teaching it and then they say the law is
[1:58:33] that all this has to
[1:58:35] happen for that to happen in you in
[1:58:39] other words their
[1:58:40] Doctrine has to come to
[1:58:43] pass in order for
[1:58:45] you to have that power work through you
[1:58:50] our Doctrine has to come to
[1:58:52] pass first that's our
[1:58:57] law then this power can work
[1:59:00] you unless our Doctrine isn't fulfilled
[1:59:05] yet you can't do
[1:59:10] it amen amen but listen to what brother
[1:59:13] vam say is controlled by a
[1:59:17] law and that law
[1:59:20] is not keeping a bunch of
[1:59:22] Commandments it's a law of
[1:59:27] Faith am the law of
[1:59:30] Faith Jesus said all things are possible
[1:59:35] for them that believe if you can believe
[1:59:38] it whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:59:43] believe it's
[1:59:46] yours whatever he can reveal to your
[1:59:48] soul
[1:59:50] that you believe that's possible it's
[1:59:55] your every place that the soul of your
[1:59:59] feet steps upon by faith God gives it to
[2:00:04] you it's your possession you possess it
[2:00:08] if you can find the key to this law of
[2:00:11] faith it opens it to you you see what I
[2:00:14] mean is
[2:00:16] controlled by if you're a son of
[2:00:18] daughter
[2:00:20] daughter of God that power never leaves
[2:00:26] you hallelu with you all the
[2:00:30] time but your

[2:00:37] that but the power
[2:00:41] still when you're saved God gives you
[2:00:44] Faith to rise above the muck of the
[2:00:48] Earth your faith
[2:00:50] overcomes the things of the world what

[2:01:10] your faith Rises up above it if you
[2:01:14] don't do it you don't have any
[2:01:16] faith and by faith you're saved
[2:01:19] through Grace and as much as your faith
[2:01:22] will be
[2:01:25] released

[2:01:32] faith will be
[2:01:34] released from you that's how much

[2:01:41] have because in you dwells the power to
[2:01:46] make heavens and
[2:01:47] earth God will in you there you are but
[2:01:52] it's your faith Jesus would say
[2:01:56] according to your faith be it unto you

[2:14:40] abides then we
[2:14:42] understand that we have to use Faith
[2:14:46] now to to operate what we
[2:14:50] have that's what brother Brandon was
[2:14:52] telling the Pentecostal he
[2:14:54] said it's good it's good praise God

[2:26:28] lives we must see him and him
[2:26:32] only amen we must look to Jesus
[2:26:36] Christ Hallelujah hallu this is why bam
[2:26:40] said it's been the same in every time
[2:26:44] when you separate yourself from anything
[2:26:48] then it's just you and God hallelujah
[2:26:51] it's what you do with God you as an

[2:27:22] minority always in the
[2:27:25] minority amen one child you see where
[2:27:29] I'm going one child that's all it took
[2:27:33] that's right God just needs one man
[2:27:37] that's all he needs somewhere where he
[2:27:41] can have a Voice Hallelujah somewhere
[2:27:45] where he can have a voice that's all he
[2:27:48] wants just to get one man in his control
[2:27:52] how he loves to get one
[2:27:54] man he got Noah one time he got Moses
[2:27:58] one time he got
[2:28:00] Jeremiah Elijah and
[2:28:02] Elisha he got John he got a Samson as
[2:28:07] long as he can get one man in his
[2:28:09] control that man is his voice hallelujah
[2:28:14] hallelujah he can speak through him
[2:28:17] and condemn the world how he
[2:28:21] hungers and he looks to get a
[2:28:25] man in his control that I can speak to
[2:28:29] him and let my voice be known through
[2:28:33] him it will be my voice Hallelujah hu
[2:28:38] when you
[2:28:39] surrender in the hands of God Amen to
[2:28:44] have him control of you that becomes his
[2:28:50] Voice Hallelujah huj one is the majority
[2:28:54] with
[2:28:55] God hallelujah no matter how much
[2:28:59] minority might
[2:29:01] CH the
[2:29:03] majority with God Amen is one person
[2:29:08] surrender in the hands of
[2:29:11] Almighty glory amen and in that form one
[2:29:17] is the
[2:29:18] majority with God because we are not
[2:29:23] looking at the things that are see
[2:29:26] visibly we are looking at the things
[2:29:29] invisibly by faith in the word of God we
[2:29:33] look to the promise and that promise is
[2:29:37] true it's yay it's Amen Hallelujah they
[2:29:42] cannot fail and we've got the power in
[2:29:45] US
[2:29:47] already to bring it to pass but the
[2:29:50] faith is what's lacking many times to
[2:29:55] believe that it can be so Hallelujah but
[2:29:59] if our hearts are not in
[2:30:03] condemnation if we are under the blood
[2:30:06] we can have that faith we can have that
[2:30:09] confidence we can have that
[2:30:12] assur and know amen that I'm not doing
[2:30:15] it to be shown to be
[2:30:18] seen amen I'm doing it for the glory of
[2:30:22] God I'm doing it because I'm in the line
[2:30:25] of his
[2:30:26] word of his commission am and when he
[2:30:30] ORD it when he says to be done it shall
[2:30:35] be done hallelujah hallelujah that
[2:30:37] spirit of God inside of you is there all
[2:30:41] the time amen but the only thing that
[2:30:45] you have to have the fa
[2:30:47] and the Revelation to
[2:30:50] recognize where his presence is we're
[2:30:53] looking for his presence we want to come
[2:30:56] and say I wonder if his presence is here
[2:31:00] or maybe it's over there or maybe it's
[2:31:03] in this or that where is his presence
[2:31:07] Hallelujah his presence is in the
[2:31:10] promise word for the age and that word
[2:31:15] must be inside of the heart the
[2:31:17] believer to realize that's where
[2:31:20] presence is everything else is
[2:31:24] in the glory has
[2:31:27] departed but there's only one place
[2:31:30] where his word is where his glory is
[2:31:34] hallelujah his presence is and that's in
[2:31:37] the heart of the believer in the heart
[2:31:41] of the Bride in this show so if you are
[2:31:45] the porter
[2:31:47] of of the glory of God if you are the
[2:31:51] carrier of his
[2:31:53] presence why look for his
[2:31:56] presence somewhere else when it's inside
[2:32:00] of you so if you
[2:32:02] recognize the
[2:32:04] presence his power will be
[2:32:08] revealed amen hallelujah because where
[2:32:11] his presence is not
[2:32:13] recognized his power is not
[2:32:19] amen am
[2:32:22] amen
[2:32:23] hallelujah oh
[2:32:25] my oh my amen mark
[2:32:30] 11:24 whatever you
[2:32:32] desire ask it whatever it is pray and
[2:32:36] believe it you'll receive it
[2:32:39] now present T it shall be given to you
[2:32:43] you can have it if you'll believe it
[2:32:46] when you ask
[2:32:49] it it's not I ask
[2:32:53] it and then it it's going to come
[2:32:57] later Jesus said believe that you
[2:33:03] receive when you
[2:33:07] ask it's present
[2:33:09] tense then you can have what you
[2:33:13] ask because quickly
[2:33:16] before the
[2:33:18] father he goes to
[2:33:21] work why because he makes
[2:33:25] intercession upon your
[2:33:27] confession he
[2:33:29] intercedes for our
[2:33:31] sins when we
[2:33:33] confess see how it's an important
[2:33:36] part that blood that builds the
[2:33:39] bridge hallelujah hallelujah notice he
[2:33:43] goes to work to make intercession
[2:33:47] Upon Our
[2:33:48] confession and that settles it that's
[2:33:51] the reason people are being
[2:33:54] healed in the meeting it doesn't take a
[2:33:57] special evangelist to come
[2:34:01] through it just takes your faith in all
[2:34:05] sufficient
[2:34:07] Christ and the
[2:34:09] omnipotence and the omnes
[2:34:13] Christ who is
[2:34:15] everywhere
[2:34:17] anywhere that you'll call upon him he's
[2:34:20] there to meet the
[2:34:22] conditions he's a very he he's very
[2:34:26] present help in the time of
[2:34:29] trouble hallelujah hallelujah he's a
[2:34:32] help in the time of
[2:34:35] trouble is that right what did the word
[2:34:37] say he hide me in his
[2:34:40] Pavilion in the time of trouble you have
[2:34:44] to be in there in Christ the time of
[2:34:49] trouble notice now as we close here
[2:34:53] Jesus told Peter flesh and blood has not
[2:34:57] revealed this to you but my Father which
[2:35:00] is in
[2:35:01] heaven notice the spiritual
[2:35:04] Revelation not by
[2:35:07] word not by
[2:35:09] denomination not by Creed not by
[2:35:13] anything else but the spiritual
[2:35:17] Revelation listen now you might believe
[2:35:21] in your
[2:35:22] mind but when you believe in your heart
[2:35:26] you got eternal
[2:35:28] life John
[2:35:31] 524 he that heareth my word believeth on
[2:35:35] him that sent me have Zoe God's own life
[2:35:40] Immortal Life why because you believed
[2:35:44] on him you have accepted him as your
[2:35:48] personal
[2:35:49] savior the blood has cleansed you the
[2:35:54] spirit has filled you not by
[2:35:58] intellectual but by a
[2:36:00] birth how God has brought it down and
[2:36:05] revealed it to you by spiritual
[2:36:08] Revelation you see Faith cometh by
[2:36:11] hearing hearing the word but you see
[2:36:15] that faith is not the very
[2:36:19] thing because faith is the purchasing
[2:36:24] power to buy or
[2:36:28] get what you have need of it's like if
[2:36:33] I'm starving to
[2:36:34] death and I have 25
[2:36:37] cents and the loaf of bread cost 25
[2:36:41] cents I can
[2:36:44] rejoice and I can have the
[2:36:46] assurance that I've have the 25
[2:36:49] cents I'm starving to death but I can
[2:36:54] Rejoice amen that I already have the
[2:36:59] loaf of
[2:37:00] bread now because I have the 25
[2:37:04] cents in my pocket I can rejoice as much
[2:37:08] over the 25
[2:37:10] cents as I could over the loaf of
[2:37:13] bread but yet the 25 cents is not the
[2:37:18] loaf of
[2:37:19] bread you understand it is the
[2:37:23] purchasing
[2:37:24] power so the faith is not the very thing
[2:37:29] it's what you need to release the
[2:37:33] power Hallelujah huj you have to
[2:37:37] recognize that presence and then have
[2:37:40] faith in that
[2:37:41] presence faith in the power faith in the
[2:37:45] blood
[2:37:46] faith that the Holy Ghost is in you
[2:37:50] that's where a lot of Doubt
[2:37:51] comes whether you have it or not amen
[2:37:55] whether you really are filled with the
[2:37:57] Holy Ghost or
[2:37:59] not amen that's where the battle is
[2:38:03] because Satan comes tells you you ain't
[2:38:05] got nothing then you hear a preacher
[2:38:08] preach and he touches certain things
[2:38:11] that are in the word and they hurt and
[2:38:14] you know that you've made a few mistakes
[2:38:18] in those areas amen you feel condemned
[2:38:22] and you say oh maybe I don't have it
[2:38:25] thank you Lord come on brother that's
[2:38:28] where the battle is Amen to see that you
[2:38:33] have faith in the power that's in
[2:38:37] you to have faith in the
[2:38:40] experience that you have with God and
[2:38:43] the only way you can have faith in that
[2:38:47] is know that it's in the word brother
[2:38:50] bam said the only way I know if my
[2:38:54] experience is real if I check it with
[2:38:57] the
[2:38:57] word my experience it's in the word I
[2:39:01] can have faith in that experience
[2:39:04] Hallelujah not just because I felt a chw
[2:39:06] at my
[2:39:08] spine or my my hair stood
[2:39:12] up amen not just because of that but
[2:39:16] take it back to the word and know that
[2:39:18] my
[2:39:19] experience I died hallelujah amen and he
[2:39:24] come in me and since that experience
[2:39:27] that I had I've never been the same no
[2:39:29] more my life
[2:39:32] changed Chang amen that's right
[2:39:35] hallelujah amen that's why that doubt
[2:39:39] and that
[2:39:40] fear is constantly battling us it's not
[2:39:44] to see
[2:39:46] whether the word is right it's not
[2:39:48] whether to see amen if there's going to
[2:39:51] be a
[2:39:51] Rapture if there is a bride if there was
[2:39:55] a prophet that's not the battle the
[2:39:58] battle is to see if that word's going to
[2:40:02] work in
[2:40:03] you and if you really got the Holy
[2:40:06] Ghost if you really have what it
[2:40:09] takes
[2:40:11] amen that's what it is but when you
[2:40:16] recognize where his presence is it
[2:40:21] releases the power of God his power will
[2:40:25] be
[2:40:26] revealed amen amen see now notice notice
[2:40:31] what brother
[2:40:32] said you you you can
[2:40:37] have sometimes remember how we were
[2:40:39] seeing how it's
[2:40:41] unconscious something in us we have it
[2:40:46] but yet many times in our in our mind in
[2:40:50] our conscience in our reasoning in our
[2:40:54] memory in our
[2:40:56] affection because of the battle that
[2:40:58] we're
[2:40:59] in in our mind in our mind
[2:41:04] listen in our
[2:41:07] mind we don't see it we don't
[2:41:12] understand amen amen in our mind
[2:41:16] we doubt in our
[2:41:20] mind we we see that that that we don't
[2:41:24] have what it
[2:41:29] takes you
[2:41:31] see this is
[2:41:33] why it cannot be
[2:41:37] depending of
[2:41:39] on what we hear as to tell
[2:41:44] us
[2:41:46] for being
[2:41:48] judged by the word that we are
[2:41:53] hearing no no we have to be
[2:41:58] judged by what's in
[2:42:01] us as we hear the word there's a
[2:42:05] difference because if if you don't have
[2:42:07] that I hope you understand if you don't
[2:42:11] have that every time you hear another
[2:42:14] preacher you're going to say okay I need
[2:42:17] now what he's
[2:42:20] saying amen and then you hear another
[2:42:23] preacher you say no I need what he's
[2:42:28] saying amen do you hear another tape
[2:42:32] Amen on one
[2:42:33] tape amen narrow as a way straight as a
[2:42:37] gate you see oh my only
[2:42:41] 12 of that
[2:42:43] generation oh God
[2:42:46] then you hear another tape it says you
[2:42:49] are the perfect sinless
[2:42:52] spotless amen then you hear another tape
[2:42:55] says works his face
[2:42:57] expressed amen you begin to you begin to
[2:43:01] think begin
[2:43:02] reason all those Works manifest in
[2:43:05] me so you see the way you
[2:43:09] judge amen if that word is in
[2:43:12] you is by when that word word is coming
[2:43:16] forth amen not whether in your mind you
[2:43:20] reason
[2:43:22] it and you begin to see if it fits to
[2:43:26] your life or
[2:43:28] not amen that's what we that that's
[2:43:31] where we lose a lot of ground many
[2:43:35] times because we're hearing the word
[2:43:38] we're hearing a certain part of the
[2:43:40] word and and then we we we begin to
[2:43:44] judge now
[2:43:47] the experience we have with
[2:43:48] God through that word that we're
[2:43:52] hearing see what I'm saying
[2:43:55] amen okay amen amen all right I say that
[2:43:59] because it's
[2:44:01] true I know I know we all
[2:44:04] experienc amenu you can go on all your
[2:44:08] life hear and all the preachers you want
[2:44:10] in the
[2:44:11] world including
[2:44:13] me and you will always feel that
[2:44:17] way amen because the
[2:44:20] word are you listening to me the word is
[2:44:23] a sharp
[2:44:25] sword
[2:44:27] sharp amen amen it doesn't just go like
[2:44:31] this and just just stay on one little
[2:44:34] thought and say okay that's nice that
[2:44:36] little
[2:44:37] thought is a
[2:44:39] discerner to keep us in
[2:44:42] line brother B said the reason why
[2:44:46] the reason why I say like it was in the
[2:44:49] days of Noah only eight
[2:44:52] Souls says the reason I speak that way
[2:44:56] how many will leave in this he says the
[2:44:59] reason I preach like that he says to
[2:45:02] keep the people in
[2:45:05] line he says I'm not telling you that
[2:45:07] you're going to you're
[2:45:09] out he says but if we make it to a
[2:45:13] place where we say okay everybody's
[2:45:15] everybody's going in he says then you
[2:45:18] get lazy then you get relaxed then you
[2:45:21] just say praise
[2:45:23] God
[2:45:27] I'm you see what I'm saying it becomes
[2:45:30] boring it becomes lazy he says the
[2:45:33] reason we preach that way we tighten and
[2:45:37] we hit this and we hit
[2:45:40] that for you to stay
[2:45:43] in that's good brother yes sir amen not
[2:45:47] trying to un christianize
[2:45:49] you amen today you're out of the blood
[2:45:52] Next Day You're In The
[2:45:54] Blood next week you're
[2:45:56] bride going in the Rapture and then this
[2:45:59] week you're not going in the Rapture
[2:46:02] because you're not fulfilling these
[2:46:04] things see doesn't make sense you've got
[2:46:08] to know what's in
[2:46:11] here but next week it will probably be
[2:46:14] another message of
[2:46:15] you know you see your name in the book
[2:46:17] you're going in the Rapture come on is
[2:46:20] that true yes that's true I can quote
[2:46:24] you another quote who is this MC if
[2:46:27] youve had the Holy Ghost in you he said
[2:46:30] that's the that that that's the evidence
[2:46:32] that's the
[2:46:33] earnest that you're going in the r you
[2:46:36] see but brother these these things that
[2:46:40] we're looking at
[2:46:42] instru is to let us know
[2:46:46] how that we can
[2:46:48] become more
[2:46:51] efficient in this battle that we're
[2:46:54] fighting more powerful powerful church
[2:46:58] now listen to listen to this
[2:47:00] quote and and and take in mind what what
[2:47:03] I was telling you right
[2:47:05] now I'm closing right here he
[2:47:09] says now he
[2:47:11] says he that heareth my word
[2:47:17] and believeth on him that sent
[2:47:19] me have eternal life and shall not come
[2:47:24] into
[2:47:25] condemnation but has passed from Death
[2:47:27] unto
[2:47:28] life listen because he's believed on the
[2:47:32] Son of
[2:47:34] God now the scripture says no one can
[2:47:37] call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy
[2:47:42] Ghost yet even the Pope says he's the
[2:47:44] Christ
[2:47:46] but he ain't got the Holy
[2:47:47] Ghost it has to be spoken by
[2:47:52] Revelation it's about to be revealed
[2:47:54] into you now listen someone else raises
[2:47:59] up now you may have intellectual
[2:48:02] Faith you may believe it listen you
[2:48:06] believe it because the word
[2:48:11] says from the standpoint of the
[2:48:17] word
[2:48:19] amen see the word is
[2:48:23] right word is right but the thing is
[2:48:26] whether it's in
[2:48:28] you you believe it from the standpoint
[2:48:31] of the
[2:48:32] word but in your
[2:48:34] heart in your
[2:48:37] soul has the Holy Spirit ever called
[2:48:42] you to that place no matter what your
[2:48:46] mind
[2:48:49] says no matter what your mind
[2:48:53] says something in your
[2:48:56] soul
[2:48:58] believes whether your
[2:49:03] mind can go
[2:49:07] crazy amen just like when brother bam
[2:49:11] said he was praying to God
[2:49:15] amen about his daughter Sharon Rose
[2:49:19] Sharon Rose he says he clothes a black
[2:49:25] C wouldn't hear my
[2:49:29] prayer
[2:49:31] amen amen then Satan came said look at
[2:49:35] your
[2:49:36] dad amen look at this look at that now
[2:49:40] he he he he throws his curtain down on
[2:49:43] you doesn't hear
[2:49:46] doesn't love you the B said everything
[2:49:49] Satan was
[2:49:51] saying everything he was
[2:49:54] saying
[2:49:57] true no matter what your mind
[2:50:01] says something in your soul Hallelujah
[2:50:08] believes then you're not outside of
[2:50:11] God outside of Christ they alienated
[2:50:15] from
[2:50:16] God they
[2:50:19] trespasses a sinner bound towards
[2:50:24] H if that word ain't in your
[2:50:28] soul that you can believe
[2:50:30] it amen Holy Spirit no matter what your
[2:50:35] mind says in your soul you believe
[2:50:38] it if you're not there then you're
[2:50:41] outside of God you're in sins and TR
[2:50:46] trespasses a sinner bound
[2:50:50] towards stand to your
[2:50:52] feet amen
[2:50:58] hallelujah that's why the word has only
[2:51:01] one place where it can
[2:51:03] rest it only has one place where he can
[2:51:07] abide it's not in a message
[2:51:10] book it's not on
[2:51:12] paper it's not in the Bible
[2:51:17] amen amen no matter how much David put
