[1:57] theah amen amen hallelujah
[2:01] the thing about it is brother the

[2:39] beginning amen
[2:43] amen they byass
[2:47] the we were supposed to come
[2:49] in into our
[2:51] theop just like
[2:54] Jesus before coming to
[2:57] flesh but we didn't
[3:00] Jesus
[3:02] did amen he was the
[3:05] word before coming to
[3:08] flesh we are becoming the
[3:13] word you see the
[3:15] difference now listen he say it's not
[3:20] promised that
[3:21] Sinners has
[3:24] Angels that's strong
[3:28] brother is that
[3:31] I'm with the
[3:32] prophet
[3:35] 1964 questions and
[3:37] answers so just to Cle the
[3:41] nail the Sinners have
[3:47] Angels see see how that see how that
[3:50] makes it
[3:51] like kind to wake up a little
[3:54] bit Hallelujah then you then you
[3:58] recognize when when brother Ram
[4:02] said you heard from your
[4:07] the when when you heard from this
[4:12] message when you heard the mother
[4:17] cry brother Adam is telling you you
[4:21] heard that you're hearing from your
[4:26] representation you know why because
[4:28] that's the word
[4:31] and your
[4:32] theop is the
[4:35] word amen let me ask you
[4:38] something where did thees come
[4:43] from amen amen they come from the
[4:48] Eternal
[4:49] attribute of
[4:52] Christ they come from him because from
[4:56] the
[4:57] invisible when he Express the
[5:00] word in the beginning was the
[5:03] word the word was with God the Word was
[5:08] God Amen that word was
[5:13] the is that right that was the pillar of
[5:16] fire called it in questions and
[5:19] answers the
[5:21] fullness of the
[5:23] attributes of
[5:25] God and from that P of Fire
[5:30] from that
[5:31] theop of Christ
[5:34] come the rest of the
[5:39] the
[5:41] yes so if that was the
[5:45] word amen and brother is saying who is
[5:48] this
[5:52] mopy is a word form
[5:58] body
[6:00] amen the the
[6:02] theop is the
[6:05] word seejah now brother listen to what
[6:10] he says
[6:11] next but look he says it
[6:16] clearly it makes it clear you will never
[6:19] be the
[6:21] word unless you was a
[6:25] thought at the
[6:28] beginning you hear what he just
[6:30] said let me read it again you will never
[6:34] be the
[6:36] word unless you was a
[6:39] thought at the
[6:41] beginning you you can't come in to a
[6:45] word body unless you were a
[6:52] thought that
[6:54] proves predestination of
[6:57] God what what destination is he talking
[7:04] about see you can't be the
[7:08] word unless you were a
[7:12] thought you had to be in the thinking
[7:16] first but you see in order to stand
[7:21] Temptation you had to bypass
[7:24] the you have to come down here in flesh
[7:28] to be tempted by
[7:29] sin then if you
[7:32] stand all the father has given
[7:36] me he's qu to Jesus all the father has
[7:40] given me will come to me and I'll raise
[7:44] him up at the last
[7:47] days see you had to be
[7:53] first
[7:54] Hallelujah you had to be an Express
[7:58] thought
[8:00] you had to be an original of
[8:03] God and that's only the
[8:09] bride hallelujah hallelujah that's
[8:12] Redemption that's
[8:16] redeemable that's whose
[8:19] names were in the land's Book of
[8:22] Life the foundation of the
[8:25] world the Son of God for Jo
[8:33] Hall we were
[8:37] there we saw the Plan of
[8:40] Redemption we seen the whole thing
[8:43] unfold
[8:45] Hallelujah we
[8:47] recognize that that
[8:50] form of fire
[8:54] ofc would come and redeem us back to God
[9:04] so you can't
[9:05] be a word body unless you were a thought
[9:10] in and a word body is a
[9:15] theen then he
[9:17] says when this body
[9:21] receives the spirit of God The Immortal
[9:25] Life inside of you it throws this body
[9:30] into subjection to God hallelujah
[9:33] hallelujah then he then he says he that
[9:37] is born of God does not commit sin and
[9:41] then he says Romans 81 there is no
[9:45] condemnation to them that are in
[9:47] Christ amen walk not after the
[9:51] flesh walk after the
[9:55] spirit now brother let me ask you
[9:58] something
[10:01] who truly
[10:04] receives the baptism of the Holy
[10:15] Ghost read the
[10:21] message although there's some preachers
[10:23] in this message that teach
[10:26] that I don't know where they get it from
[10:29] read the message he tells you very
[10:34] clearly they cannot receive
[10:39] it amen amen is that
[10:43] true the only ones that can receive the
[10:47] true baptism of the Holy
[10:49] Ghost in the
[10:51] soul is bride there's no
[10:55] yes amen that's the only ones brother
[11:00] and there's a reason
[11:03] why this is this is deep now this is
[11:07] going to confirm again what we were
[11:09] saying this
[11:11] morning there's a reason why only the
[11:16] bride receives the holy ghost in the
[11:21] soul Amen brother said the
[11:27] rest that doesn't have an attribute of
[11:30] God that was in God in the
[11:33] beginning if they don't have that
[11:35] brother said the Holy Ghost can fall on
[11:38] them every minute of their
[11:43] life and nothing happens in
[11:46] their they're
[11:48] under the baptism is falling on
[11:52] them the anointing is
[11:54] there but nothing's happening in
[11:57] here
[11:59] Hallelujah but you
[12:01] put a redeemable
[12:04] attribute that
[12:14] hallelujah hallelujah why because
[12:17] there's something on the inside
[12:19] Hallelujah that's
[12:21] connected with that Holy
[12:25] Ghost it was with it in the beginning
[12:33] down
[12:36] look the
[12:38] spirit The Immortal
[12:41] Life inside of you throws this body into
[12:47] subjection to the word brother we we
[12:51] don't
[12:52] realize how tremendous this
[12:56] is
[12:57] see what
[12:59] why why this is proving to you as a
[13:07] Believer who you
[13:09] are and if you're going in the
[13:14] Raptor why is there so much fear
[13:17] today brother I don't believe God
[13:20] brought me into this
[13:21] message to go to the tribulation yes sir
[13:26] no no if God would have wanted me to go
[13:28] to the
[13:30] he left me somewhere
[13:33] else but he brought me to this word
[13:41] for
[13:45] hallelujah amen didn't bring you this
[13:49] message Amen to throw me in the
[13:54] tribulation he brought me

[30:45] here brother says great white Throne
[30:49] judgment is here on the earth amen am
[30:54] after the Millennium

[31:25] body a s
[31:28] but when does he receive a
[31:31] body when

[31:44] this you will
[31:46] receive an immortal
[31:50] body inmortal body that cannot
[31:54] die now now you have to take
[31:58] this because he he's not saying all
[32:02] together that that Immortal bodies is
[32:05] going to live Eternal he's talking about
[32:08] a sinner that's going to go to
[32:12] hell but he is making
[32:15] emphasis that that person after he's

[32:26] go
[32:27] this he says you will receive an
[32:30] immortal body an immortal body that
[32:32] cannot

[32:53] cring you'll be tormented through all
[32:56] the ages there is to
[32:58] come Jesus said that that's a black
[33:03] picture but that's what the Bible say if
[33:07] God so condemn
[33:08] sin that it cost such a
[33:11] price what will it be to those unjust
[33:16] Spirits could ever be made loose again
[33:20] we' have another thing like we had the
[33:22] last 6,000
[33:24] years is that right there'll never be an
[33:27] opportunity
[33:31] again again when when you go to the
[33:36] Grave see your body goes to hell hell
[33:40] means
[33:41] separation death means
[33:43] separation your body dies
[33:47] separates you go from your loved ones
[33:51] here but that's not what we're talking
[33:54] about it's once appointed unto man to
[33:58] die and after that the Judgment yes now
[34:04] if you stand at the Judgment of God and
[34:07] you're going to be judged by an Angry
[34:10] God and God is going has already
[34:14] pronounced what he's going to do so you
[34:17] know what your judgment will
[34:20] be before you even get
[34:24] there is that right the ones that are
[34:26] going to be
[34:28] torment they already know what they
[34:31] judgment see and he says before they get
[34:34] there so the thing to do is to be saved
[34:38] and have this glorified
[34:41] being now look he
[34:43] says look we're not something dead we're
[34:47] alive and he
[34:50] says amen all right he
[34:55] says
[34:58] I'm going jump down
[35:00] here he says how quick that God knows
[35:03] every
[35:05] thought that we think of everything that
[35:08] we do he knows
[35:11] of so when the
[35:13] believer dies he goes into the presence
[35:16] of his
[35:18] maker his God When The Sinner dies he
[35:22] goes into his
[35:24] destination now I'm talking now of the
[35:28] elect but there's some of them that will
[35:32] come
[35:33] up in the second
[35:35] resurrection that will have to stand in
[35:37] the Judgment with the sinner to be
[35:40] judged with him I want to be sure to get
[35:46] that first that will take
[35:50] place the will be the coming of the
[35:53] Bride amen there will be people in the
[35:55] world you might differ a little with
[35:59] this but listen close just because you
[36:03] accepted
[36:04] Christ as your personal
[36:07] savior doesn't mean you're going in the
[36:13] r just because you accepted
[36:17] Christ as your personal
[36:19] savior does it mean you're going in the
[36:24] Rapture is that right
[36:29] Hallelujah that's for the
[36:32] elect that will go in the
[36:35] rap there will be a Remnant left here on

[36:42] persecution and the Great
[36:44] Tribulation the church will be caught up
[36:46] in the
[36:48] R so just because people accept
[36:53] Christ as their
[36:55] savior amen amen and they believe that
[36:58] they stay with that and they give their
[37:01] life for that does it mean that they're

[58:03] church brother quotes Psalms
[58:08] 139 vers 15 and
[58:11] 16 where he is he is
[58:14] proving that out of our
[58:18] being physical was in God's thoughts at
[58:21] the
[58:22] beginning and this is where David
[58:25] said my substance was not hid from
[58:31] thee when I was made in
[58:35] secret and curiously rocked in the
[58:37] lowest parts of the
[58:40] earth Thine Eyes did see my
[58:44] substance yet being
[58:47] unperfect in th book were all my

[59:13] body on the
[59:15] earth and God already
[59:18] had picture in his
[59:23] mind
[59:25] but then there come a time amen amen
[59:29] when the
[59:30] L was
[59:32] expressed from that come for Len to me
[59:38] of
[59:39] the amen and that
[59:44] theing is the
[59:47] image of you
[59:53] imperfection brother went beyond the
[59:55] curtain of
[59:56] time none of those people's
[59:58] bodies were there with is that
[1:00:03] right did he see his
[1:00:06] daughter Shar rose
[1:00:10] rose was she a little baby like when she
[1:00:15] died she was a young
[1:00:18] girl that little baby
[1:00:21] body the dust was down in the Earth
[1:00:29] amen Amen brother we weren't supposed to
[1:00:31] come
[1:00:33] babies Adam didn't come a
[1:00:37] baby didn't come a
[1:00:41] baby they come full
[1:00:44] St
[1:00:45] amen that's the picture of God of
[1:00:52] you look what he says he says he know
[1:00:56] you have dark hair blue eyes and so
[1:00:59] forth the picture
[1:01:01] snapped the age of about 20 years
[1:01:05] old this says identified Christ of all
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] ages he says then death sets in and you
[1:01:14] start dying no matter no matter how much
[1:01:16] you eat how well you put food back into
[1:01:20] your
[1:01:22] body there's not scientist in the
[1:01:25] world that can explain it and then he
[1:01:28] goes on I want to go down
[1:01:30] here and he says but
[1:01:34] God has an
[1:01:37] appointment and man must die and face
[1:01:41] the judgment and you're going to keep
[1:01:43] the the I'm sorry the appointment
[1:01:47] friends while we're here tonight we want
[1:01:51] to remember those things that we've got
[1:01:53] to meet that

[1:02:06] meet now in that appointment that God
[1:02:09] has made with
[1:02:10] man this
[1:02:13] body must because it is yet
[1:02:17] negative it's subject to death so
[1:02:20] brother B calls this
[1:02:22] body the negative
[1:02:26] amen so there has to be another body
[1:02:30] which is the
[1:02:31] positive
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:35] amen he so he gets the eternal
[1:02:40] spirit he his
[1:02:42] attribute displayed in that
[1:02:46] body then like any
[1:02:49] picture it's in negative
[1:02:52] form what happened
[1:02:55] when a picture's in negative
[1:02:57] form of course brother talking about in
[1:02:59] his day right because now you got
[1:03:02] digital
[1:03:03] and and all
[1:03:05] this right he talking about negative
[1:03:09] pictures in his day right what do they
[1:03:12] have to do right they had to do what the
[1:03:17] negative that goes into a dark
[1:03:23] room negative goes into a dark
[1:03:26] room there it's
[1:03:28] developed it comes out to the perfect
[1:03:38] picture
[1:03:40] picture in
[1:03:43] eternity he took the picture of the real
[1:03:47] living
[1:03:49] image of
[1:03:51] his who you were going to be for all
[1:03:57] eternity you took a picture of that but
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] negative amen amen is put in a dark
[1:04:05] room this is
[1:04:10] thetive all of these 30 years 29 years
[1:04:15] 30 years amen it's been in
[1:04:21] a amen amen one of these
