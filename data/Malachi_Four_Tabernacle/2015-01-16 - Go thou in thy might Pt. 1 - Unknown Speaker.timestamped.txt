[0:00] Prophet seeing the bride right now
[0:03] amen amen he was a March yes
[0:12] and she was divine gravity yeah
[0:20] that's why we have to brother Adam said
[0:23] she was marching because
[0:30] that's the sound of the words
[0:34] no message
[0:37] we taught us that the word of God is
[0:40] a sheep
[0:42] is that right amen and the directors
[0:46] don't enter into the spirit of the
[0:49] composers
[0:52] they're not giving the right they're the
[0:55] right direction that's right direction
[0:58] is that right yes and The Magicians are
[1:02] lost
[1:03] is that right so
[1:13] amen are the ones that have to beat it
[1:16] out according to the sheet notes
[1:19] amen and then the rest of the sentence
[1:22] can play according to what has been
[1:25] promised
[1:28] and then he says
[1:32] if you remember
[1:36] he says they're playing this they're
[1:40] playing in a in a drama
[1:42] they're not just playing music
[1:45] they're playing for a drama
[1:49] is being acted out
[1:51] on the on the stage
[2:02] he said in three times
[3:06] Symphony has to
[3:38] where they play soft music
[3:43] oh
[3:45] that's
[3:46] that's what if we don't follow
[3:50] according to the dramas hey man we're
[3:53] not going to be playing the correct
[3:54] notes
[3:57] that we're supposed to be playing out
[3:59] right now
[4:02] Hallelujah for instance what if the
[4:04] director is saying
[4:07] hey man let's play the climax
[4:10] and you haven't prepared for the climax
[4:14] amen right it's not the scene because I
[4:17] said for the climax yeah everybody wants
[4:20] to play the climax
[4:22] you see what I'm saying hey man we have
[4:25] to go according to the sheets
[4:49] sometimes you're
[4:52] taking in yes that's right that's right
[4:55] all right yes that's right that's right
[4:59] foreign
[5:13] Hallelujah
[5:21] so that's the reason why it's not about
[5:24] when we get into things like this
[5:26] we want to be led of the spirit yeah we
[5:31] want to enter into these things
[5:33] amen with with the mind of cross
[5:38] amen hallelujah and when we look at it
[5:42] we identify within the economics amen
[5:45] certain details that we are walking in
[5:49] them right now
[5:51] or maybe something that we that we need
[5:54] to apply because
[5:59] amen amen
[6:01] and I believe this is what this is what
[6:03] this is for okay
[6:09] amen ever want to speak a little bit
[6:13] on God
[6:15] requires is
[6:22] so we see the scene here
[6:25] where the angel of the Lord
[6:28] appears to Gideon
[6:31] after the prophet's mess yes
[6:47] amen amen
[6:50] president
[6:53] of the scriptures it's a picture
[6:59] of the church today
[7:02] just as soon as it gets out of one twist
[7:09] but the time
[7:14] that's the same now as long as the time
[7:17] has come foreign
[7:50] Time for Action
[7:53] they have been playing Church yes
[7:58] you cannot face the enemies
[8:03] amen we were playing church
[8:08] and when the Harvest time comes
[8:12] for them the Gathering all that they had
[8:15] worked foreign
[9:00] possible
[9:52] Hallelujah
[10:16] and then the enemy alone in illegal is
[10:18] fleeing for them that's how you know
[10:20] Hallelujah that scene comes later
[10:23] amen amen but first in order for that to
[10:28] take Dwayne
[10:29] there must be some things
[10:37] must be done
[10:39] amen amen so that's why you saying
[10:43] it's time for Action
[10:45] amen amen it's time for playing
[10:48] religious
[11:00] he says he said
[11:02] God
[12:20] that was on his heart yes
[13:04] come on
[13:41] years ago was just the same time a
[13:43] hundred years ago a thousand years and
[13:47] he is at the same today
[14:15] finally human flesh
[14:43] that's right that's why
[14:46] it's important to see
[14:50] what a purpose here in proposition of
[14:54] the Prophet was
[14:56] amen he's telling you right here
[14:59] he was to bring them back he doesn't
[15:02] understand
[15:29] that was a true problem
[15:31] he was anointed he was the voice of God
[16:03] oh my God and which challenge is ready
[16:08] must be met forever
[16:26] to meet the challenge foreign
[16:34] hey
[17:12] then you are in Christ
[17:20] hey man
[17:23] amen amen you see okay
[17:27] then that takes away all the scare and
[17:32] this is
[17:37] maybe this is not right
[17:40] maybe it's too much
[17:46] there's a lot of that in the message
[18:03] the prophet that
[18:05] he found his
[18:08] types
[18:10] you found his life
[18:13] in the scriptures
[18:25] born A peculiar person that's another
[18:28] person yeah a star announces
[18:33] what is he doing
[18:36] I mean it didn't find this identity
[18:38] because his life
[18:43] this is Holy Christopher amen amen star
[18:47] appeared
[18:50] amen
[18:57] amen all these things
[19:02] see and that caused a lot of trouble
[19:04] because
[19:08] amen amen so look at the bride today
[19:14] taking scriptures
[19:16] and saying look that's the problem
[19:19] then after the prophet yes
[19:25] look at Revelations 22 16.
[19:29] this is my angels
[19:33] to testify these things
[19:38] in the churches
[19:53] and then
[19:55] a lot of people just take that last week
[20:00] I saw this he said verse 17 says he said
[20:04] versatility he said and the
[20:14] spiritual life to testify not verse 17.
[20:19] the spirit of the Bride okay
[20:37] right there
[20:44] the spirit Prophet is yes
[21:03] amen blowing the trumpet
[21:06] revealing the Mysteries
[21:12] revealing all these great things
[21:19] through his ministry all the human flesh
[21:23] you're saying God identify he says
[21:26] because in his ministry
[21:27] Elohim in a body of Flesh
[21:32] Discerning the thoughts
[21:43] he only read
[21:45] from verses
[21:55] so then why are you reading from 8 to
[21:57] 11.
[21:59] because
[22:04] to announce the birth of John the
[22:07] Baptist
[22:09] in Luke chapter one
[22:11] he quoted Malachi 4.
[22:20] Eagles
[22:33] read the scripture
[22:35] that's what a lot of people say
[22:37] Malachi four or five to brother Brown
[22:42] Luke one quoted it okay
[22:58] foreign

[24:19] some kind of spiritual admission
[24:29] it's being fulfilled now
[24:56] oh yeah
[24:58] so we see that I said there's things
[25:02] like that that causes that we we must
[25:05] identify that they remove the identity
[25:08] that these things for our lives
