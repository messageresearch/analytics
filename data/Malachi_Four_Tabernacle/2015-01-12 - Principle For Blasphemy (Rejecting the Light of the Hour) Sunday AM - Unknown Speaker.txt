conscience a long time or they're in paris god never forgave israel revelations 2 14 i'm just going to quote these things you can write them down if you want he says i have something against you because you have those foreign your life they have to be like to bring sickness yes that right whatever you buy on earth in heaven whatever you lose pay but they may have a chance but carrie writes children right you know why i'm okay because they're names and i just heard a testimony last night that comes between this one i know from brother kenny cats kitty cats amen brother captain son of cats from the brown tabernacle me i only called uh megan romano he said she wasn't there was nothing really to look at this yeah like jesus amen in other words she was ugly that's what you were saying but that's not said that he said we're always here one of them has been married twice now come on that's right that's right okay i'll leave you alone oh because brother and sister for carmanos they were slicker than a laugh yes of what a prophet was saying here amen and she says she overrides their own free moderate agency yeah amen and i thank christ jesus our lord who have enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before he's speaking of himself a blasphemer and a persecutor i'm curious that i'm curious but i obtain mercy because i did it ignorantly and unbelief yes it will because proverbs 18. and we can eat our own fruits and they that love it because shall eat the fruit thereof amen i'm nervous easy you understand now he did that paul did it in ignorance but he was he said himself it was a blast 1963 we know and after a while that's right the penalty of sin was death we're all balancing those almost a thousand thinking foreign and we're gonna he said if but satan because i do not believe i believe is amen then he brought angels with him is that right and that's what other man called fallen angels that's what revelations 12 speaks of which is that the final was between jesus christ bit i'll tell you about them the will of god in heaven and it's him and it was presented to him but he went against that foreign in other words the because when satan come to the earth hey the first verse amen i mean so when the angels fell brother all the angels that ever failed what is happening in this world that is what has foreign foreign yes foreign because that began in the beginning come a greater kingdom than michael christ yes is do you think we'll have automobiles they don't know what to do but to unite with a and they still need this the people didn't call me they know god called me up god called you if someone thought if someone called you into this mess then someone else can take you away amen amen that's why paul said they went from us because they wasn't us how many people are laying in the message what they're doing i'm leaving the message okay okay do they know the knowledge of the message did i know the quotes they hear the tapes okay building up a hybrid church to build an intellectual kingdom about churches okay hallelujah is taught but don't you think that this should be done and that should be done oh but just because it doesn't work see is building a christian economy and you see what they become there's only amen so that we can get a better understanding of what we're saying and you know hebrews 6. hallelujah amen hebrews 6 everyone says verse 4 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and havitation of the heavenly king and were made part takers of the holy ghost illuminati the good word of god and the power of the world to come they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance they crucified themselves the son of god of french and put him to an open chain yesterday amen amen fact they have tasted they have received a true revelation of god in your heart in a week from after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin for a certain fearful looking for judgment fiery indignation we shall devour the act adversaries wasn't who are not in that category uh you judge every single human being by what um that's what jesus said it was better for you not to know because to him amen how many know you know what you've been called for in this house okay is that right i mean to be the bride of christ hey man i mean listen to this he knew the perfect will of god but he refused to do it did you know that he says satan knows his pride kept him from they amen man if look at it in the genesis 4 6 and 7. why are you why has you come to its fault why are you full of i wonder what message he was hearing because the only one he was with was able now he says are you using your freaking man's filter so why did you do and for the world for something that's not the word it's a human nature the days of miracles if they don't i don't condemn you it's because you don't believe you won't do that a believer doesn't do that make your man's future if you don't make a bad sense i won't do that all right but you see sitting live at the door like i was trying the knowledge his wife had a holy spirit amen i mean what is satan doing on the earth today he is working trying to accomplish the same purpose that started before and but it's taking the interpretation germany he said i'll give you all of this if you'll worship me see my lord that is his plan at work today amen that he says no easy i had another question and they said brother bill you know my will the bible said says it had to come from the lord because god is the only creator and he god created the devil that's that right what are you a man without the spirit of god he still got the beast ungodly nature that thing makes you go crazy religion is the only truth the religion of jesus christ if you give a man it's right man i'm gonna prove that by the bible that you're not in your right mind until you find christ their own is the 300 ministers the greater ministerial association of chicago their ministers he said now let me shake little individual the other day 300 of those tapes there was about 75 and they said we're coming down to be re-baptized re-baptized be careful and we have a bunch of promises because they not fulfilling okay what they said and the watch out this has she rejected it so she's dead she'll never rise again i'm gonna read this and then i'm gonna say something in the end and when come on yes in their presence amen is that right yes and people are hearing them maybe one day amen you don't have to stab a man in the back of him amen because what we is right here and ain't exactly what i thought you see there's a few things that i didn't think about before there's this and then there's this yes and then now there's this and then there's this and i never thought it was going to be like that there he is that's right brother yes sir hey come on they weren't talking like that until oh yes yes lord that's right and it what i can say the thing is brother because i said we got a face to face put faith in your heart in chicago what is it it's a bible saying that when they do that they separate themselves between mercy and judgment says it's impossible as people see for those who are watching life amen has been brought back to look at secretaries and i had the knowledge of the truth and they tasted the good word of god they were returned from that right and they have renewed themselves who has seen the truth and have rejected guilty of the crucifixion of jesus christ the holy ghost may he take you on hebrews 10. where it tells us again in the scriptures not only being impossible i shall is is god's face lord jesus are christ is it causing something in us to take time it's getting lazy but where is to is we serving his people i said he has the weather are you sure on your own hey man hey family the only way yes somebody come god is able of these posts to raise children i got something that you i said if you got something that you could disprove it let's have it right he teaches how that man they he says read he said the demons in your life amen amen there's a pressure on the people today and the pressure has no limitation on what denomination you're from or what person you are older hurry up and wait since we've been california california this last trip let's talk it's been it's been that the people they like to go home early california you find people different some of them they just like to hear you preach i don't care if you don't even pray for the sick you just whether them for four or five hours preaching and that satisfies them right but over here they just seem like they want a short sermon and let's get back home right quick because i got to get back again everything
