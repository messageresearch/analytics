[1:20:14] commissioned him he said nothing will
[1:20:17] stand against
[1:20:19] you not even
[1:20:21] what cancer can
[1:20:25] amen amen not even
[1:20:29] cancer and then he and then he preached
[1:20:32] do you fear
[1:20:37] cancer amen do you fear that shadow of
[1:20:41] death that comes upon the people what is
[1:20:44] cancer brother B said that's a name that
[1:20:47] the doctors give
[1:20:50] it amen but it's a demon
[1:20:54] is that right he says but why do they
[1:20:56] call it cancer because of the sign of
[1:20:59] the
[1:21:00] cancer what's the sign of a cancer it's
[1:21:03] a
[1:21:04] crab
[1:21:06] right and what does the crab do he says
[1:21:09] it has different
[1:21:14] tentacles amen amen different arms and
[1:21:16] legs it spreads
[1:21:20] out legs
[1:21:25] right amen he said that's exactly what a
[1:21:28] cancer does in a person's body wherever
[1:21:32] it it
[1:21:33] starts then it spreads
[1:21:37] out it's a Spirit Come From
[1:21:44] Hell amen amen but then it makes itself
[1:21:49] manifest and science can prove it look
[1:21:51] it's right there
[1:21:54] but they don't know where it come from
[1:21:56] they say this caused it here and this
[1:21:58] caused
[1:21:59] it yes but there's something even behind
[1:22:02] that and then people can't
[1:22:05] believe they can believe that but they
[1:22:08] can believe that the god of
[1:22:10] Heaven can also come down from heaven
[1:22:13] and also become flesh and also take form
[1:22:18] and also brother Ram said that light
[1:22:22] inside of you begins to grow and grow
[1:22:26] and grow and grow until every fiber of
[1:22:30] your being is so filled with the Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost until even a
[1:22:35] Viper can bite you in the arm and you
[1:22:38] can shake it off like Paul in Acts 16

[1:22:59] anointed that the Venom in that Viper
[1:23:02] couldn't do nothing to
[1:23:04] him amen but people they they can have
[1:23:07] more faith the satanic
[1:23:10] Spirit manifesting itself in witches and
[1:23:15] wizards amen amen and in magicians
[1:23:19] inos yes and they can prove it and say
[1:23:23] there's something there's a spiritual
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:26] world that makes them people act
[1:23:30] like but when it comes to God in his
[1:23:33] word when it comes to God's spirit when
[1:23:36] it comes to the anointed of the Holy
[1:23:38] Ghost oh that's just your fake it's

[1:24:48] Fire he finishes with
[1:24:51] the
[1:24:54] amen
[1:24:55] amen but he has to wait 6,000 years to
[1:24:58] do
[1:25:00] that he's almost getting ready to deal
[1:25:02] with
[1:25:04] it he's already dealt with it in our

[1:25:44] here must
[1:25:46] understand amen that I cannot conform
[1:25:51] myself amen with just one part of the
[1:25:56] scripture but I understand that I have
[1:26:00] took a step of
[1:26:02] faith in one part of the
[1:26:06] scripture that's acts
[1:26:08] 238 I have
[1:26:11] repented of my sins I have accepted
[1:26:14] Christ as my
[1:26:16] savior and I have accepted in my heart
[1:26:19] to be Lord Of My Life and Lead Me and

[1:26:27] waters as a
[1:26:31] ceremony yes not that that has anything
[1:26:34] to do it's just a

[1:26:40] testify of what I've done in my heart
[1:26:44] amen and that's when you understand that
[1:26:48] you
[1:26:49] understand I'm beginning here
[1:26:53] amen amen but I
[1:26:55] have more
[1:26:58] scriptures just like that one
[1:27:01] scripture I have
[1:27:05] more Hallelujah and take another step of
[1:27:09] feet amen and I have another
[1:27:12] scripture and step into that
[1:27:15] one by faith how did you enter into the
[1:27:18] first
[1:27:20] one you believed
[1:27:22] brother Bram said amen in the
[1:27:30] message
[1:27:32] 1961 he said the same faith that you
[1:27:36] used to bring to come out of a world of
[1:27:40] sin and accept Christ he said that same
[1:27:44] faith will keep
[1:27:47] elevating more and more more don't make
[1:27:51] it complicated
[1:27:53] amen it's the same faith that they use
[1:27:56] at the
[1:27:57] beginning is the same faith that you got
[1:28:00] to keep using to keep advancing but a
[1:28:04] lot of people even in the message oh
[1:28:07] baptizing water hallelujah praise God
[1:28:10] hallelujah amen
[1:28:14] amen there's no
[1:28:17] expectation am there's no understanding
[1:28:21] that I got to keep
[1:28:24] go and they
[1:28:27] just you know baptized
[1:28:32] Hallelujah did the world
[1:28:34] change from the days of Noah when it was
[1:28:37] baptized with water no sin still come
[1:28:42] back why did God destroy with
[1:28:45] water because of sin right then he
[1:28:48] baptized it with water and sin came back
[1:28:51] out again
[1:28:54] right that didn't deal with the
[1:28:57] problem God keep advancing with his
[1:29:00] word amen prophesying that there was
[1:29:04] coming a messiah the
[1:29:06] Savior to shed his blood on
[1:29:09] Calvary Hallelujah shed that blood and
[1:29:13] that blood fell on the ground Amen
[1:29:16] brother Adam said it Sanctified the
[1:29:18] Earth is that right word to God GL
[1:29:22] Hallelujah that was blood
[1:29:25] sanctification by the blood but he said
[1:29:28] that blood that fell on the ground was
[1:29:32] only
[1:29:34] chemical of the food that Jesus
[1:29:37] ate but there was a life inside of that
[1:29:41] blood that's the
[1:29:45] token of God and that life didn't stay
[1:29:50] there it come back on the day of
[1:29:53] Pentecost amen and it filled
[1:29:57] 120 amen
[1:29:59] amen but the Earth still
[1:30:03] continued in sin and all of that how
[1:30:07] many know that
[1:30:09] sanctification is the most
[1:30:14] deceitful and it's the most
[1:30:19] dangerous place to be in
[1:30:24] because brother bam said you cannot
[1:30:27] remain too long in that condition and
[1:30:31] people don't preach that people don't
[1:30:34] know that they they think that they can
[1:30:36] be
[1:30:38] justified and
[1:30:40] Sanctified and live in sanctification
[1:30:43] for 20
[1:30:44] years you cannot live in the state of
[1:30:49] sanctification for a long time that's
[1:30:52] not what I say that's the prophet of the
[1:30:56] age why he said he showed us why because
[1:31:00] the vessel is
[1:31:02] empty the vessel is Sanctified the
[1:31:05] vessel is clean and something something
[1:31:10] something has to fill
[1:31:13] it and if the spirit of God don't fill
[1:31:16] it then something else is going to fill
[1:31:20] it religious spirit Spirit of the world
[1:31:24] Spirit of something is going to fill it
[1:31:30] amen you understand beautiful that's why
[1:31:33] even in
[1:31:34] sanctification amen I don't do the
[1:31:36] things I used to do all the habits and
[1:31:39] things I used I don't have that no more
[1:31:42] amen I'm I'm dedicating myself to the
[1:31:45] word I'm consecrating myself amen I'm
[1:31:50] sanctifying myself
[1:31:52] in in obedience to the word the word
[1:31:56] says amen I'll do it that
[1:32:01] sanctification hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:32:04] even at the next
[1:32:05] stage amen you have to realize I cannot
[1:32:10] stay here because if I stay like this
[1:32:14] and I'm
[1:32:15] conformed that I don't have those habits
[1:32:17] no more that I don't do those things no
[1:32:19] more amen and I I know that if the
[1:32:23] promise of the Holy Spirit doesn't fill
[1:32:27] me I'm going back into those same habits
[1:32:32] I can only live in this
[1:32:35] stage for so much of a
[1:32:38] time but if I'm not filled I'm going
[1:32:42] right
[1:32:43] back brother sister this is the hour
[1:32:47] where we must press forward press
[1:32:50] forward don't give up my

[1:44:48] ground and so not among thorns
[1:45:01] let's go to Luke chapter
[1:45:07] 8 I remember we read this
[1:45:12] before but now look at
[1:45:14] this verse
[1:45:19] 14
[1:45:25] the parable starts
[1:45:28] in in verse
[1:45:32] fouru he gives the
[1:45:35] parable the S went to se
[1:45:39] seed some fell on the way
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:44] side verse
[1:45:47] five down and the fouls of the earth
[1:45:49] devoured
[1:45:54] some fell upon the

[1:46:06] thorns and the Thorns sprang up and
[1:46:08] choked

[1:46:14] ground then he gives the
[1:46:19] interpretation
[1:46:22] down

[1:46:29] 14 and that which fell among Thorns are

[1:47:02] retain in your
[1:47:04] heart that

[2:06:28] Masters but God
[2:06:30] promised be
[2:06:33] careful God has
[2:06:35] promised Malachi 4 for this last
[2:06:40] day Malachi 4 has not yet been
[2:06:45] fulfilled this is
[2:06:47] 62
[2:06:49] people can twist this quote and make
[2:06:51] some weird stuff out
[2:06:53] it I've seen it done
[2:06:59] before but what they don't understand is
[2:07:02] the other quote where he
[2:07:03] said in lean Church age
[2:07:07] Exposition which they don't even believe
[2:07:09] in that that's why they don't quote
[2:07:12] it but he said in the
[2:07:15] messenger he said there the messenger
[2:07:20] will do two things one he will restore
[2:07:23] the hearts of the
[2:07:24] children back to the faith of the father
[2:07:28] two according to Malachi 4 in Revelation
[2:07:32] 107 he will reveal the seven
[2:07:36] Thunders which are the
[2:07:39] Mysteries contained in the Seven
[2:07:43] Seals that's what he said not something
[2:07:46] outside inside the seven
[2:07:49] seal he said and it will be that
[2:07:52] Revelation that will turn the hearts of
[2:07:55] the children to the faith of the fathers
[2:07:58] you understand that you understand what
[2:08:01] I just
[2:08:02] quoted that Malachi 4 is going to be
[2:08:06] fulfilled when he preaches the seven
[2:08:10] Thunders this is
[2:08:13] 1962 the Thunders haven't been preached
[2:08:16] yet to turn the hearts of the children
[2:08:18] back to the faith of the
[2:08:20] father here he says Malachi 4 has not
[2:08:24] yet been
[2:08:25] fulfilled but it must be
[2:08:28] fulfilled glory to
[2:08:31] God it is a gerti word of
[2:08:35] God spoken through Malachi the
[2:08:38] prophet you know why I hit that right
[2:08:41] now when I when I read that because I've
[2:08:44] I've seen that teaching
[2:08:47] before even at one time I was influenced
[2:08:50] by
[2:08:51] it you know why they'll take this quote
[2:08:55] and they'll throw it away in the
[2:08:57] future and they would say brother Adam
[2:08:59] left the scene and he was still an
[2:09:03] evangelist get next to yourself amen and
[2:09:07] they'll quote take inside with
[2:09:09] Jesus and he said I'm not in the office
[2:09:12] of a
[2:09:12] prophet I'm an evangelist and I say Amen
[2:09:17] because that was 19
[2:09:19] 62 but what people don't understand if
[2:09:23] they would study the message amen and
[2:09:26] they would go into the message and
[2:09:28] really find it
[2:09:29] out here anointed ones at the end
[2:09:33] time he said the only
[2:09:35] office he was speaking of
[2:09:38] office the only office that can reveal
[2:09:42] the word the highest
[2:09:44] office is the
[2:09:46] prophet and he said said the third
[2:09:49] pull was the
[2:09:51] revealing of the Seven
[2:09:56] Seals yes sir so did he enter into the
[2:10:00] office of a prophet or
[2:10:04] not where they get this nonsense from
[2:10:08] they twist the word to fit their
[2:10:13] Doctrine and I and I tell you their
[2:10:15] Doctrine is
[2:10:17] manmade
[2:10:19] they make their own
[2:10:24] Doctrine but when you when you uncover
[2:10:26] the
[2:10:27] thing you find out wow that's not the
[2:10:32] wordu Hallelujah it sounds good it has
[2:10:36] it has message in it but it ain't the
[2:10:42] message Hallelujah that's what I was
[2:10:44] telling a brother down in
[2:10:46] Mexico amen believe the message
[2:10:51] according to a
[2:10:52] tradition that has been taught for years
[2:10:56] and that's how they follow the
[2:10:59] message
[2:11:02] saying and
[2:11:05] beliefs the pastor preaches you know the
[2:11:10] return how does he preach
[2:11:13] it the majority of the people that that
[2:11:17] believe in a return
[2:11:21] Ministry don't even know half of what it
[2:11:23] really
[2:11:27] means and they're out all outside of the
[2:11:29] word
[2:11:32] everywhere why because they believe it
[2:11:38] traditionally with no understanding with
[2:11:41] no
[2:11:43] Revelation amen Amen brother and sister
[2:11:47] this is not to be followed just because
[2:11:49] I preach
[2:11:52] it and because you come to church
[2:11:55] here and because you're a member of the
[2:11:57] church and this is what we
[2:12:00] believe don't don't start that
[2:12:04] nonsense
[2:12:06] amen then it becomes a
[2:12:09] tradition and you're just following
[2:12:11] because that's that's the
[2:12:16] thing amen brother Bram was always
[2:12:19] against that type of
[2:12:25] thing what seed are we planting
[2:12:29] brother I pray God
[2:12:33] always before I come up here don't let
[2:12:36] me do anything outside of your
[2:12:39] word let me just stay in your
[2:12:42] word and be sensitive to your
[2:12:46] spirit to be able
[2:12:50] will let your Holy Spirit can
[2:12:54] Minister
[2:12:56] amen and that's not for no one's Glory
[2:12:59] that's for glorifying the word of
[2:13:03] God because this thing when we when we
[2:13:09] realize that it's all
[2:13:11] God how many know that brother Bram
[2:13:14] said Moses did not create one
[2:13:19] thing amen how many know that brother
[2:13:22] Bram said I can show you the
[2:13:24] quotes mes didn't do one
[2:13:29] Miracle Moses didn't do nothing it was
[2:13:34] the
[2:13:35] angel
[2:13:37] Christ that did
[2:13:39] everything but
[2:13:41] Moses was the man that he was
[2:13:46] using he took sand
[2:13:48] threw it up in the air he said fleas
[2:13:51] come well that's not Moses that's God in

[2:18:06] people he says it's given to the
[2:18:08] messenger of the age he says then is
[2:18:11] given to those who are Faithfully
[2:18:15] taught is that what the prophet said
[2:18:18] he says and then the light is
[2:18:20] spread with those who say only what the
[2:18:24] prophet messenger has
[2:18:26] said and then after that the prophet
[2:18:29] says see people have to be blind not to
[2:18:31] see
[2:18:33] it because right what he says right

[2:19:39] messenger in the former
[2:19:41] rain he will be
[2:19:44] rejected by denominational people
[2:19:49] he will be rejected by denominational
[2:19:55] people as his
[2:19:58] forefather John and
[2:20:01] Elijah as was spoken by our
[2:20:05] Lord amen amen oh
[2:20:09] brother when we see this we got to
[2:20:12] realize
[2:20:13] something Jeremiah is preaching amen
[2:20:18] he's telling break up your follow
[2:20:21] ground because I am the prophet that has
[2:20:24] D say it the Lord and if and if the
[2:20:27] ground is prepared and
[2:20:29] ready and they receive this they'll be
[2:20:33] saved from the Judgment that I'm
[2:20:37] prophesying amen amen you get iten but
[2:20:41] if not that judgment is coming
[2:20:44] anyway now listen to this oh my amen and
[2:20:49] then he
[2:20:51] shows from where this is coming
[2:20:54] from let's go to the
[2:20:57] Book of
[2:21:03] Ezekiel chapter
[2:21:07] 7
[2:21:14] amen forgive me this chapter
[2:21:19] 16 because I told you at the
[2:21:23] beginning that this is the
[2:21:26] Judgment of the
[2:21:29] Harlot
[2:21:31] revealed in the
[2:21:34] revelation of the Supreme
[2:21:37] judge because what I'm
[2:21:39] showing by the word is that what
[2:21:43] Jeremiah are you
[2:21:44] listening what Jeremiah is prophesying
[2:21:47] in Jeremiah
[2:21:48] 4 is that this judgment is coming to the
[2:21:52] amen amen but he he gives he gives
[2:22:00] specifics of how it's going to come and
[2:22:03] when it
[2:22:05] comes he said it's coming from the
[2:22:07] north what else did he say in Jeremiah
[2:22:10] 4 he says it will come like a
[2:22:15] whirlwind what else did he say
[2:22:17] it will come like a
[2:22:19] cloud on
[2:22:22] horses swifter than
[2:22:26] Eagles he gave all these
[2:22:29] descriptions listen of the Judgment of
[2:22:33] the Wrath coming to
[2:22:37] Jerusalem that's Jeremiah's
[2:22:39] prophecy you
[2:22:41] listening
[2:22:43] amen but when Ezekiel sees
[2:22:47] of what Jeremiah
[2:22:50] prophesied he doesn't see it as judgment
[2:22:55] coming he sees the same thing that
[2:22:58] Jeremiah
[2:22:59] prophesied but he sees the
[2:23:02] glory what is what does Ezekiel see in
[2:23:06] Ezekiel 1 remember we preached
[2:23:09] it you're in the study with
[2:23:12] me and we preach Ezekiel
[2:23:15] 1 what did did Ezekiel see he saw a
[2:23:21] whirlwind Ezekiel chapter one right a
[2:23:25] whirlwind was coming is that
[2:23:28] right from where Ezekiel 13 from the
[2:23:33] north hello it's coming from the north a
[2:23:38] worldwind and then he looks at the
[2:23:40] Whirlwind it turns into a cloud and then
[2:23:43] the cloud turns into fire and then the
[2:23:46] fire
[2:23:47] is the color of
[2:23:50] amber and then from there he sees a
[2:23:53] throne and he sees one sitting on the
[2:23:55] throne and his voice is as many
[2:24:00] Waters I'm trying to show you that what
[2:24:03] Jeremiah is
[2:24:06] prophesying judgment is coming to
[2:24:10] Jerusalem amen amen judgment is coming
[2:24:14] to Jerusalem but when Ezekiel sees
[2:24:18] he sees that this judgment that's coming
[2:24:22] is God
[2:24:24] himself In This Cloud and then he sees
[2:24:28] closer and he sees the throne he sees
[2:24:30] the four living creatures he hears the
[2:24:33] voice as the voice of many
[2:24:35] Waters did John see the same thing in
[2:24:39] Revelation chapter one what did John see
[2:24:43] he saw Christ with the white wing watch
[2:24:47] the white wiek
[2:24:51] judge brother bam said that's
[2:24:57] judgment but in that judgment that has
[2:25:00] come it's not
[2:25:02] coming it has
[2:25:06] come in that
[2:25:08] judgment the bride like eel sees the
[2:25:13] glory coming to her amen hallelujah see
[2:25:18] this is what people don't
[2:25:21] understand that
[2:25:23] judgment does
[2:25:26] not or doesn't
[2:25:30] stop
[2:25:32] God from redeeming his
[2:25:35] people only his
[2:25:37] people people have a traditional
[2:25:42] concept that when judgment
[2:25:45] comes
[2:25:47] Redemption there's no more
[2:25:50] calling there's no more nothing that's
[2:25:54] true but when full judgment
[2:25:59] comes amen amen amen remember I I showed
[2:26:03] you the other
[2:26:04] day that
[2:26:06] Ezekiel is in the time where it's not
[2:26:10] completely
[2:26:11] mercy and is not completely
[2:26:15] judgment it's between
[2:26:18] after Mercy has
[2:26:20] ended the lamb Goes Forth takes the book
[2:26:24] and that's no longer
[2:26:27] Mercy seven Church Ages was Mercy full
[2:26:33] Mercy amen amen tribulation
[2:26:36] period and on down to the
[2:26:40] Millennium full
[2:26:42] judgment but there's an in
[2:26:44] between after church ages
[2:26:47] and before
[2:26:49] Millennium after Son of God and before
[2:26:53] son of David there's something happening
[2:26:56] in
[2:26:57] here and that happening in here is the
[2:27:02] Throne of
[2:27:04] mercy and Judgment at the same
[2:27:09] time amen you say is that scriptural
[2:27:13] brother that's the message I preached it
[2:27:16] time and time
[2:27:17] time but here Jeremiah is showing
[2:27:23] us prophesying of this judgment coming
[2:27:27] from the
[2:27:28] north he said it's a whirlwind he said
[2:27:33] it's a cloud he said this is Judgment
[2:27:38] for Jerusalem that has turned into
[2:27:43] a but when Ezekiel sees it he sees the
[2:27:47] Whirlwind coming from the north he sees
[2:27:50] the cloud he sees the glory he sees the
[2:27:53] throne he sees one sitting on the throne
[2:27:57] he sees
[2:28:00] horses swifter than
[2:28:03] Eagles he sees four living creatures but
[2:28:06] for him it's
[2:28:09] Redemption for him is
[2:28:13] Mercy amen for the denomination is
[2:28:17] Judgment for Ezekiel it's
[2:28:21] Grace
[2:28:24] hallelu the
[2:28:25] Judgment of the
[2:28:27] Harlot
[2:28:29] revealed in the
[2:28:32] revelation of the Supreme
[2:28:36] judge what was that white
[2:28:38] wig Supreme
[2:28:40] judge in that Revelation it will show
[2:28:44] you how the Harlot
[2:28:47] denominational systems will be burned
[2:28:49] with
[2:28:52] fire the
[2:28:54] nation of America of the United
[2:28:58] States in the seventh vision of the
[2:29:01] Prophet what did he see Hallelujah did
[2:29:05] he warn this
[2:29:07] nation receive
[2:29:09] Christ this year or you will see the
[2:29:12] judgments of
[2:29:14] God and after that what happened
[2:29:17] brother when that cloud come listen to
[2:29:20] me he received the revelation of the
[2:29:23] Seven Seals to call the bride unto
[2:29:30] Redemption but at the same time that
[2:29:33] sign where he received that Revelation
[2:29:36] from at the same time Matthew
[2:29:40] 2430 yes Matthew
[2:29:42] 2430 is
[2:29:45] Judgment at the same
[2:29:48] time amen amen and a year after that he
[2:29:52] throws a rock up in the air
[2:29:55] judgment amen amen
[2:29:58] prophesize West Coast going
[2:30:02] down judgment but at the same time he
[2:30:06] has a message see he's calling judgments
[2:30:10] but at the same time in that same
[2:30:12] message in that same glory in that same
[2:30:15] coming of Christ
[2:30:18] he's bringing
[2:30:19] Redemption for his
[2:30:22] own you understand did not the prophet
[2:30:25] say this day the scriptures
[2:30:28] fulfilled he said it come from Heaven as
[2:30:32] a revelation to me remember
[2:30:36] that walked into the
[2:30:38] synagogue and had the
[2:30:41] scroll of the book of
[2:30:44] Jeremiah of of Isaiah
[2:30:47] is that right brother bam said that's a
[2:30:50] entire Bible 66 chapters 66 books in the
[2:30:55] Bible amen amen here was the word made
[2:31:00] flesh having the word
[2:31:02] written in his
[2:31:06] hands and this is what people don't
[2:31:09] understand
[2:31:09] today it's not that you're that you're
[2:31:12] doing
[2:31:14] away what has already happened
[2:31:17] no is that you're taking the message and
[2:31:20] you're showing by the message what is
[2:31:24] now that's the
[2:31:28] difference amen amen and what did Jesus
[2:31:31] do with the with the book of
[2:31:34] Isaiah are you listening to
[2:31:36] me amen amen what did he do if he had
[2:31:40] the book of Isaiah and he was
[2:31:43] Jesus he why didn't he go
[2:31:47] to
[2:31:49] Isaiah could he had read Isaiah
[2:31:53] 6 an everlasting
[2:31:56] sign a son will be
[2:32:02] given Isaiah 6 preach a message super
[2:32:06] out of Isaiah
[2:32:09] 6 yes sir he could have gone to that
[2:32:12] scripture but how come he didn't read it
[2:32:16] because that was already
[2:32:18] history he had already
[2:32:20] come about 30 something years
[2:32:24] ago see even 30 years
[2:32:28] back was already
[2:32:31] history he didn't want to open the
[2:32:34] word and preach something from 30 years
[2:32:39] ago are you hearing
[2:32:42] me no no he could have done it but he
[2:32:45] didn't do knew it he could have gone to
[2:32:48] Isaiah
[2:32:51] 96 unto us a son of
[2:32:54] given his name Shall be Called Eternal
[2:32:59] Father right
[2:33:01] amen Mighty
[2:33:03] God right a virgin shall conceive could
[2:33:07] Jesus would could could had he had read
[2:33:10] that
[2:33:11] scripture yes but he would have been
[2:33:15] preaching message of 30 something years
[2:33:21] ago Hallelujah are you getting it and
[2:33:25] today that's all that ministers
[2:33:30] do that's all they do yes it's the
[2:33:33] scripture yes it's true yes it was
[2:33:38] fulfilled yes but for
[2:33:42] thee they're
[2:33:44] blind brother Adam said in the message
[2:33:48] Satan's
[2:33:49] Eden he said Satan will allow you to see
[2:33:55] all that was and all that will be but he
[2:33:59] will keep your eyes
[2:34:00] blind to what is
[2:34:02] now
[2:34:05] amen amen the angel of the Lord that was
[2:34:09] with the prophet is still doing
[2:34:13] something with the message
[2:34:17] of that
[2:34:19] Prophet amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus could
[2:34:23] have
[2:34:26] easily went to the
[2:34:28] scriptures of Isaiah he's in the book of
[2:34:31] Isaiah you think Jesus could have read
[2:34:34] Isaiah
[2:34:38] 53
[2:34:40] right like a lamb before his shears he
[2:34:43] was
[2:34:45] dumb
[2:34:47] he was wounded for our
[2:34:50] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[2:34:52] was upon
[2:34:53] him here Jesus is at the pulpit in the
[2:34:58] church and he has the book of
[2:35:01] Isaiah he can read from all those
[2:35:07] scriptures could he had read of Isaiah
[2:35:11] 53 but he if he would have read that he
[2:35:15] couldn't have have
[2:35:17] said this day the scripture is
[2:35:20] fulfilled he would have said this is
[2:35:22] going to come in the
[2:35:24] future they're going to take me they're
[2:35:27] going to crucify me I'm gonna die for
[2:35:32] you or he could have took the other
[2:35:35] scriptures that said I was born 30
[2:35:39] something years ago to come and save you
[2:35:43] but he didn't read the past or the
[2:35:45] future
[2:35:48] the scripture says in Luke 4 he found
[2:35:53] the place amen you got to listen to
[2:35:56] those details of the
[2:35:57] Bible he found the
[2:36:00] place where was written of him Isaiah
[2:36:06] 61 the spirit of the Lord is upon me and
[2:36:11] has anointed me to preach the
[2:36:14] gospel set the captives free to bind the
[2:36:18] broken
[2:36:19] hearted oh brother to preach the
[2:36:22] acceptable year of the Lord and then he
[2:36:26] stopped
[2:36:27] right sometimes we read
[2:36:30] quotes and you don't have to read them
[2:36:33] from beginning to
[2:36:35] end if you're intellectual you you have
[2:36:38] to do
[2:36:39] it but if you're led by the spirit you
[2:36:42] can stop right in the middle of the
[2:36:44] sentence
[2:36:46] amen amen look at Gabriel when he came
[2:36:50] to Mary when he came to Elizabeth eleth
[2:36:54] what did Gabriel quote to Elizabeth
[2:36:57] Elizabeth the child that will come from
[2:36:58] your
[2:36:59] womb will not drink strong drink is that
[2:37:03] right amen because he shall turn the
[2:37:07] hearts of the fathers to the children
[2:37:11] and Gabriel stop right
[2:37:14] there amen
[2:37:16] how come he how come Gabriel didn't say
[2:37:19] and the hearts of the children to the to
[2:37:21] the
[2:37:21] fathers because he knew that's for
[2:37:24] Malachi
[2:37:27] 4 Jesus stopped right in the middle of
[2:37:31] the
[2:37:33] verse it wasn't a a comma there to
[2:37:37] stop there wasn't a a uh uh uh what do
[2:37:41] you call period to
[2:37:43] stop he wasn't looking at grammar
[2:37:47] he was led on the spirit and he stopped
[2:37:51] at preaching the acceptable year of the
[2:37:55] Lord is that
[2:37:57] right and then the prophet said it's
[2:38:00] revealed to me that the second part is
[2:38:06] Judgment he said and brother Bram said
[2:38:10] this day that second part is
[2:38:14] fulfilled amen H
[2:38:16] Allelujah he didn't the son of man
[2:38:18] didn't come like he did 2,000 years ago
[2:38:23] he come in Angelic form veiled himself
[2:38:26] in another body and he said this is
[2:38:32] Judgment this is the second part for the
[2:38:36] second coming for the day of the Lord
[2:38:39] and in that day he will have a white wig
[2:38:43] in that day he will have seven thund
[2:38:46] in that day he's not a lamb he's a lion
[2:38:52] roaring seven

[2:38:59] feet Ezekiel
[2:39:02] 16 as the musicians

[2:39:12] says I want to
[2:39:14] read here in
[2:39:18] scripture can
[2:39:21] see verse
[2:39:24] 32 of
[2:39:27] 16 says but as a wife that committeth
[2:39:30] adultery was taketh strangers instead of
[2:39:32] her
[2:39:39] husband and that what Jeremiah
[2:39:43] prophesied amen they give gifts to all
[2:39:46] but thou givest thy gifts to all
