========================================
that old C bird can stand up and be as happy and shouting and full of the same rain that the weed is there you are they can shout they can speak in Tong impersonate everything they want to but in that day they'll be called workers of iniquity I I told you listen to what I say listen close look back examine yourself with the word and see where you're at if you women not short hair amen have makeup paint wear shorts cut off your hair if you men amen are still smoking going to pool halls and you I hold to this organization you better stop examine yourself with the word you have to live above those things if you can't obey those small things those small things listening if you can't obey and these small things you will not catch these other things it'll go over the top of your head as far as easy is from W in this time that we're at now if you can't see those little things we're we're into something now that God is revealing the Hidden Mysteries that's been put in the book before the foundation of the world and if you can't see the little things you won't be able to see the mystery that is being revealed they will go over your head oh Lord did you hear what he's saying and then after he says that he says like Gideon separating his men there was thousands and thousands and God said that's too many separate them he gave them another test and then he separated them again he gave them another test and down he went until he got a little handful and he said that's the group I want to do the job what happened Hallelujah that's why in this hour I read the quot this morning

over the top of their head as far as from east to west separating his he gave him a test then he separated gave him another test then he separated until he come down to hand brother that's why every
