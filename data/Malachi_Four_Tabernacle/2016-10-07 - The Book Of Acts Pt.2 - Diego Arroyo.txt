TRANSCRIPT
========================================
from the book of Acts chapter 13 we read from verse amen verse 40 reading 49 verse 52 I'm sorrys chapter 13 all have it tonight verse 40 says beware therefore Le that that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets and wonder perish my work of work in your days of work ye shall no wise [Music] believe this is Paul preaching in Antioch to the Jews is letting them know that the work of the holy spirit is in continuation and the son of man into the body and that work that was done Amen in the Lord Jesus Christ he was the one that David spoke of he was the one that Moses spoke of he was the one that Isaiah spoke of all of these prophecies spoke of him yet the Jews are blind yet they cannot see it and in the book of Acts we find that there was many of the Jews that followed the church they were following the church uh they were added to the church Bible even says a few chapters down that there were some of the Pharisees that had believed also in the gospel but uh they were still Pharisees and later on they show their colors but we're what we're looking at tonight as we open the scripture we're seeing Paul bringing the word to the Jews this was one of the last uh messages that Paul is giving directly to the Jews amen and of course we read where he is quoting the book of habac chapter one amen where it is prophesied what he quoted there amen amen I work a work in your days a work which ye in no wise will believe though a man declared un verse 42 and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next s so there was some Gentiles there that heard this and while the more these Jews heard you see many Jews had believed brother mam said the body of Christ is composed of Jews and Gentiles so that early church that had Peter and James and John they were Jews amen they reive the Holy Spirit they believed the sign of the Messiah they followed the word they were in the continuity of the work of God of course that in that group there was a lot of unbelief as well in that Exodus out of law into the dispensation of Grace amen there was a lot of unbelief just like in the first Exodus with Moses so not all that was following them not everybody that was with the church just been called out were fully Believers Amen on the day of Pentecost 120 that was all SE amen but as it continued on there was many that were added like we have pointed out some were added to the church some were added to the Lord there's a difference that's why brother Bon preached against just being a church member amen you're added to the church that's fine we we should have a church should have but we must belong to One Church to one body amen and that's the body of Jesus Christ so we read here verse 43 now and now when the congregation was broken up amen many of the Jews and religious prelit followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuade them to continue in the grace of God the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together toar but when the Jews saw the multitudes were filled with and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicted and Blas then Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken to you but seeing he put it from you judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles so for so for for so ha the Lord commanded us saying I have sent thee to be the light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation of and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord as many as were ordained to eternal life believe amen how many believe in predestination the Bible speaks of it amen and this early church these early Believers were ordained to eternal life and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region but the Jews stirred up The Devout and honorable woman and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against PA Barnabas and expelled him out of their host but they shook off the dust with their feet against them that that's what Jesus told him to do and came unto ion the disciples were filled with joy yes amen the Lord the bless to the of [Music] word so reason I have chosen this part in the book of Acts being that we've been on this this teaching looking at this and seeing how we are exactly uh as the church was then after the ministry of the son of man then as we ended uh Sunday if you remember just to kind of pick it up back where we left we established through the the word and we want to pick it up there where the the church today right today us the Believers we are in the exact place scripturally amen as the church was in the book of Acts that's what Malachi 4 AM was going to do that is the product that is the result of brother br's Ministry amen and when we look at it a lot of times we have already said uh when we when we unconsciously interpret what brother bam meant when you said Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of act we unconsciously interpret that as signs wonders and just a good time and that's what we think the book of Acts is about or that's what we think brother R meant when he said the book of Acts but if we take the book of Acts in its entire context as I believe the Holy Spirit has helped us already to see that this is the body that is speaking is not focused on one church not focused on one Ministry this writer Luke showing the diversity of the different members in the body different gifts in the body and different operations of the Holy Spirit through that one body under the one head which is Christ Amen brother bam said that's true Oneness amen that's God the Holy Spirit In You operating his word amen that's why Jesus pray let them be one father as you and I are one said that's the only way we can be one amen is that in first I become one with the Lord you become one with the Lord we are part of the his body then we find our place in the body and the body is not separated the body is all jointed together it's all connected it's all working for the same purpose it's all working under the Same Spirit the same intelligence the same head is controlling the whole body amen that's that's the reality of the book of Acts now you got to keep in mind something that when we're looking at the whole book of Acts this it expands more than 30 years from acts one to acts 28 amen acts 27 um this is an expansion of time in which is showing us the history of the church amen and within the book of Acts Luke is picking up only some of the things of the history of the church in other words he speaks of the Corinthian Church in the book of Acts but he does not he doesn't he doesn't write about how they did not have the gifts in order amen does it speak of how Paul went and had to set them in order by the word we read that in the letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians in other words Luke is just outlining the whole history amen of the church we know that there's a book of James right he wrote his epistle well in the book of Acts we see that James is martyred he's beheaded amen the book of we read that what tell you that tells you that the epist of James over here amen was written within the book of Acts you understand what I'm saying all of the Epistles of Paul amen his his first letter amen was to the Thessalonians amen the first book Paul ever wrote the first letter he ever wrote was it Romans although Romans is put as the first one of his after but the first one he wrote was T according to history and according to the time according to the book of well when we see amen what he wrote in Thessalonians we see the great mystery amen we see our day spoke of am he wrote to all of these what I'm trying to say is is we're not just reading the or we're not just looking at the book of Acts as some little thing that happened here and then all the rest of the Epistles was in some other time no no all the Epistles were written except a few like uh first John Revelations those were written out but the majority of the Epistles in the new test were written in the understand what I'm saying hallelujah so this is how we're looking at the we're looking at the book of Acts as the entirety of the New Testament Church in other words within the book of Acts Paul was the messenger amen he was the messenger to the AG he was the prophet he was the one that had the message Hallelujah but there was other Ministries that were also ministering the book of act this is the history of the church outlining many things to us showing us showing us that in this continuation the book of Acts or this uh this new book of Acts another book of Acts the same Works will be done so again picking it up where we have shown remember we quoted it verbatim but I'm going to read some quotes tonight um of how Jesus left the scene Ministry of the son of man in Corporal form back returned in the form of the pillar of fire amen and during this time of the book of Acts he is in working in and through the members to achieve something to do something that is how we've seen already that people were able to notice they had been with Jesus they seen the same things that Jesus did reflecting through his body the same character of Jesus in Steven as he died amen you see the same life of Jesus in Philip being translated by the spirit in other words uh Dimensions walls distance wasn't a factor amen can be translated in the spirit just to get to a un to make them understand the word am amen because God is his own interpreter but brother bam said that unit needed a guide the message of guide says he needed a guide to lead him to understand what Isaiah 53 is speaking of amen and the God is the holy spirit but he was giving his word word and his direction through his body he also tells us in spoken words The Original Seed you've already quoted this before amen that the seed comes through the body my SE comes through my body do come through my head to my body say so the seat of Christ spoken word is the Original Seed he said it comes through his body he says although they were directed by Angels an angel LED Peter to cornelius's house is that right he said but the seed came through Peter word receive the Holy Ghost angel LED Philip Amen to the UN but the seed came to the body amen hallelujah so this is I believe a tremendous thing so the reason I chose this reading tonight within the book of Acts is because here we are seeing although the Holy Spirit was blasphemed the day of Pentecost God was still fulfilling the words of Jesus go to the lost sheep of Israel you shall be my Witnesses after you receive power from on high not go to the Gentiles before dealing with the you shall be my Witnesses beginning at Jerusalem into Judea and into Samaria and into all the parts of the world so being that that was the words of the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit directed The Body directed Peter directed the the the the ministry of that day and the church to stay some for some season for a time within the Jews or to the Jews am amen but the time came we read it here where God turned a corner where God listen to me God turn his back to the Jews tells us now look how important this is to identify the work of God in your day amen because to me when I look at this I see the same thing today of how people think how people look at things can you imagine can you imagine these Jews amen they hearing Paul you're hearing Barnabas and Paul is trying to let them know what the work of God is he's identifying it by the scripture he's letting them know by the holy spirit amen and yet amen amen am amen they put it from them amen they don't take he they don't accept the way he's preaching the word amen they have their own ideas what the word is they can't accept it but what I see is this I see jealousy I see Envy in in the Jews I see them despising the word I see them hearing this sermon from Paul and contradicting it a contradictive spirit amen I see the they're blaspheming against what Paul is speaking contradicting what Paul is speaking amen and then the Holy Spirit has to do something now you got to understand that God can only move his work by his in instrumentality of man brother B has taught us that Satan is powerless can't do nothing unless he has somebody that he can work is that right what is going to bind Satan in the Millennium a chain is somebody gonna tie him down said circumstances well Revelations tell us it's a chain that's a symbol right it's a it's a symbol and in this day those symbols have been revealed so we know what that chain mean circumstance well what are the circumstances no the Russians won't be in the Millennium no the Sinners won't be in the Millennium no there won't be nobody in the Millennium that that Satan can work through only bride and 144,000 Jews will be in the Millennium with that shows us something that that that indicates that Satan needs somebody to work brother said God does amen God needs his body Amen to continue his work now why am I pointing this out because this is God we're talking about this is the holy spirit we're talking about and God in his heart is choosing to leave the Jews and turn to the genti according to his his desire according to his word he's going to start seven Church ages is g to deal with Gentiles Hallelujah he's gonna stop dealing with Jews he's gonna stop giving his word hear me directly from God a living word to thews right but we notice how it's we notice how God his to the listen how important this is what I'm saying do you think those Jews knew that when Paul and Barnabas turned their back that that was God turning his back on they probably laugh they are do they think they are yeah right be like to the Gentiles you're turning your back on us what I'm saying little did they know wasn't Paul turning his back wasn't Paul and Barnabas turning their back God you see amen why why am I saying that why are we starting there because the same thing is happening yes the world rejected the sign of the Messiah 50 years 60 years ago just like they rejected in their days brother Ram said when they when those Jews scream amen for Barnabas no for barabus I'm sorry it was right and they said him what shall we do with Jesus of son of man right let the blood of him be upon us they rejected the son of man religious Jews listen even though they had still wasn't when he turned his back on then the day of Pentecost came he divided his Spirit amongst his people right they acted like drunk people amen they staggered in the spirit brother bam said Peter rose up out of the gutter amen and preached hallelujah amen and people made fun of him people are drunk full of new wine what they've been doing up there what they've been drinking up on there what they have something up there you're getting Lo down am what's going on right Peter said these men are not drunk like you this is the scripture but that even though that was part brother said the angel of Mercy was still seing according amen amen to the Bible the angel of Mercy was still giving salvation to Jews at that time after they had rejected the son of man after they had crucified him after they had made fun of the Holy Ghost you see God is patient God is merciful but there comes a time where he finally says that's and this my brothers and [Music] sisters finally his get what I'm saying said Paul little did they know when Paul said you rejecting the word this word that I'm preaching is nothing to you turn to the this is God's M this is God's Prophet amen amen amen amen when he turned that was God in heaven turning his back message right amen what's going to happen in this last day is God gonna turn his back again he's going to turn his back against the Gentiles he's going to turn his back just like he did here in the book of Acts amen say he that is Holy am amen amen is be that shows us something you understand what we're looking at that God working through his body in the book of act and people rejecting that [Music] word what what do these brothers think they are Israel and the church said notice how perfect that Jesus re rejected of the Jews sent back the Holy Spirit and they laughed at them and made F of them said they're drunk on new wine and Jesus said you can blaspheme me if you speak one word against the Holy Ghost and those Jews come up and said those men are full of new wine haa it's very important brother man taught us a message in 1961 to respect respect in the in the in the series of Revelation chapter 4 2 I believe it was part three I'm not sure brother refers back to Mount where the glory of God would come down on the mountain and shake the mountain amen remember that Exodus 19 and brother benam reads the part in the scripture where the Lord commanded Moses to tell the people they could not touch the mountain not even gaze brother Ram says there's a lot of people today that when that Glory that was on the mountain comes into his people they like to gaze that people in the spirit like to gagee that people brother said you shouldn't do that and the message respects brother Bram said you should have respect if you don't understand it if you don't know what that is that doesn't justify this these people not only rejected or didn't believe in they contradicted but the tremendous thing here is that where finally God turned his back on them as we said after they rejected the son of man after they made fun of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost when God turn his back on you that means that you're at the mercy of the devil you're left Amen to the powers of Satan that's what they were left the Jews were left to the powers of Rome which Satan has always controlled always been an enemy of the [Music] church when God turned his back on them Paul and Barnabas hallelujah hallelujah because amen it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you amen was necessary but seeing that you put it from me Jud yourselves unworthy everlasting life L we we turn to [Music] thees why because we want to verse 47 for so have the Lord commanded yes saying I have in other words I knew exactly by the leadership of the Holy Spirit now it's time to stop here go turn our back is amen hallelujah but if you keep reading the story oh they kept following Paul they followed him they sred up the people there am am followed him a lot of places they didn't care he said he didn't want have nothing to do with them no more their job was to give them a hard time that just created more miraculous things Amen brother bam says here the holy the Holy Spirit was poured out and they rejected it when the Jews rejected it the Gentiles Reed is that what we read we read right there and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord amen mother the discipl with joy amen hallelujah now watch what brother mam says he says they made fun of him and not no more than 30 years or better Theus Titus besieged the walls and they ate one another's children and they massacred them and burnt the temple according to God's word and it's never been raised until the days of the Gentiles be Di and there I'm fixing to visit Jerusalem in the next few weeks their old ruins and the Weeping walls there they have been scattered all over the world Amen God told them they would do it and they would come down and did it see because the curse of rejecting the Holy Ghost now watch this next book they asked brother Bram the question what position will the church be in when the gospel returns to the Jews now you understand right God is going to turn his back to the Gentiles and he's going to go back to the Jews and they asked brother Bram what position will the church be in when that happen he said now this person was referring he told me our brother that he was referring to her said the Gentiles will TR the walls of Jerusalem till the Gentile dispensation would be finished now that's in Luke 2124 listen closely beautiful question wonderful reads the scripture and when ye shall see Jerusalem Compass about with armies and know that the Desolation thereof is n now let's catch this close now the Desolation is nigh when you see Jerusalem comp passed around with armies that's been a lot of confusion right there with you people but approaching it from a historical standpoint with the Bible now the Seven Day Adventist Brethren they believe that Jerusalem will again be compassed to B with armies that could be true but scripture has count many many times amen amen now he says now as Jerusalem to pass about with armies but literally historically that was during a96 I'm Prophet questions andw number one literally historically that was during a96 when Titus had besieged Jerusalem but now watch this closely you can see you can see the difference Jerusalem will be compassed about with armies again at the end time I [Music] believe well I believe this here was comparing with when Titus besed when the Desolation bear out speaking was when Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy place he said when you see the Abomination that make desolation standing in the Holy Place see Abomination is unan when you see the Abomination that make desolation standing in the Holy place scripturally fulfilled when [Music] tius Titus didn't bese Jerusalem after the day of Pentecost no he did that 30 some years later remember Sunday we quoted to you to show show you where the book of Acts is positioned after the gospels where the son of man revealed himself and before Titus coming to besiege Jerusalem that's where the book of Acts is and if we are in another book of Acts today we are after the revealing of the son of man and before this besieging of Rome is going to come not just upon Jerusalem but the whole world because the target is the bride of Christ to be persecuted and this squeeze brother brand is going to come upon the bride we're the ones that is directed to but we won't be in the tribulation we won't go through the tribulation we won't go through the persecution but we will feel the squeeze amen so here we are am speaking today Bri around the world positionally according to the Bible and the message this is where we're at this is another book of Acts whether we believe it or not whether we understand it or not whether we have our own ideas or about it or not this is where we're at well are we in another book of Acts I think we should see more you know tongues and more this yes but that's not all the book of Acts amen amen understand what I'm say in other words many times it's hard for people or for all of us to see ourselves as the church as the bride that is living the when actually that's exactly what's taking in other words the book of Acts is not going to start when the squeeze starts that would have to be the end of the what I'm saying amen the book of Acts as I said is about well Jesus ascended in 33 that's when the Holy Ghost came down amen and Titus didn't come I just P it until 9697 place you said it shows you how many years was in between understand now in the uniting time in sign brother says that Jesus pointed the church to show them when this sign was going to be upon Jerusalem what to do when that when they would see that sign and brother bam called it national side Jesus pointed to a national sign he was the sign amen and then he spoke that there would be signs in the heaven amen he also said these signs shall follow them that he spoke to many signs but he spoke also of a national sign that was going to come in the future well this ministry that repeated again in this last day of the son of man also pointed us to the same sign he showed us the sign being revealed again of the son of man to the Gentiles he showed us these signs would follow the church amen in my name they shall cast that devil amen they shall take up certain Paul in the book of act they shall not harm them amen amen he he showed us these signs but he also showed us it's coming a national signu now brother bam says here they wanted to know when the end of the world what would be the sign at the end he pointed into to many places through the scripture about National signs about Heavenly signs in the heavens Earthly sign he gave them sign sign and signs just constantly a sign he told them in one place about a national sign he said when you see Nations begin to gather around Jerusalem we know that there's a time of trouble at hand you see Jerusalem compassed about with army before that they could do this the world had to unite that's what the prophet is saying before Titus the great Roman general could unite his armies together the world had to unite after these Jews had rejected their god-given sign of the end time to that that's the time that Titus United his armies amen together to come and take the city first here had to be a uniting of God's people so against the word of God before that the nation could unite itself against God's people the unity the unting I believe that we're living in a great uniting time I'm taking these red lights down amen and Flash signals and everything of the woman and how they do men and how they do and churches and how they do showing to this little group with all my heart that I believe we are lining in the line of God's word in this great prophetic hour just before the coming of the Lord Jesus uniting together and getting ready see before Titus United the Nations and his army Israel United themselves together and banded themselves they would not believe in Jesus to be the Messiah now you see you see this it's the same thing happening again the religious world in the Gentile World amen amen uned the military on the other hand under a power but before the military force can come to carry out the orders to slaughter all those who will not unite to this religious system amen amen has take Hallelujah in other words what I'm trying to show you is that if this book of Acts is the alpha nowhere in the book of act do we see that Titus comes in to kill and if we're in another book of Acts we won't see that in this one we do see trials and tribulation we do see some persecution we do see some tightening up amen we see famine side you see many things but we don't see that they go through this part they were the Nations begin to unite themselves together and Titus brought this great Army of Romans and Greeks but it wasn't just Roman army because Jesus said that Nation didn't just say Rome was going to come amen but that but the thing is that that's in the sh this is in reality it was reality back then and they had another shadow that they looked at look there wasn't one of them Christians when Titus United these armies Greeks Romans whatever they be America you know uh the French the British Nat amen amen yes have they United just like Titus United the armies over there are the armies United today what so the word is perfect am Hallelujah but there wasn't one of them Christian in there for they saw the sign and move yes God does the Lord willing said Jesus told him to pray for that and they never caught one of them in there they were gone they looked at the sign and they were G that's all there was too oh how the church is today to see the sign of the time that we're living in flee as hard as you can to for life not in some church but to Jesus Christ unite yourself with him not with some organization or some church Creed with CHR and be sure that it's him amen you can't just take anything you got to be that what a Time hallelujah amen amen you see that watch what brother says the message your day brother says like Israel back in her Homeland she don't know how she got back there she just automatically she was just automatically put why National Force put her in her place amen National put them back in their home I'm say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland listen a national force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God Amen will put the people hallelujah the world forces this way the world forces that way but God forces amen that's why in the other quote we seen that brother says none of those Christians were C by you see what I'm showing that in this book of Acts this bride won't be cut by this National Force amen cuz he's saying a national force is going to force the church into the World Council churches it's either that or death but the bride is free from death and she's definitely free from that counsel because the power of God is g to force us upward the spirit of which is the word of God my word is spirit and will put the bride in because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place no National Force will do it so people are waiting many people in the message waiting for the squeeze to be POS is that right they're waiting oh brother when the squeeze come you better watch out they're actually saying that they need National Force to put them in their position it puts them in a different category the bride has to be positioned before that this is another book of Acts brother we're going to fill the squeeze yes we're going to slice and we're going to cut amen when that begins when that Council begins to tighten up what we see temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of his yes brother don't wait till you got to recognize your position in the word he said that she would recognize I believe brother with all my heart whether we can believe it or not or understand it or not that's what's being done now but the National Force did Drive Israel to her home land National forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the but the power of God will rise the bride into Glory all people recognize your day as Jesus warned you the sign of Sodom the church's he says pergam Church age I quoted this Sunday I believe according to Revelation 13 1316 that the Bri will have to stop preaching the Beast is demanding the mark the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted amen denominations will take the will be forced to quit preaching but you see like we said Su let it be that that stops you hallelujah amen L will come for his bride and [Music] judge you see that you see how plain that is and how that God is to turn his to the Jews sorry to the Gentiles turn back to thew now let's go to the Book of Revelation we're going to finish with this Revelation 10 have you understood so far we just touched point tonight just to make itain amen we touched it at the end there on Sunday and I I kept feeling that for today just to reiterate and make it a little more clear then we can see it the picture more clear the book of Acts we're at after son of man before Titus so Revelations 10 said is the seven SE did he say hallelujah Revelations 10 is the seven SE Christ comes down from book in his hand amen he sends it down to the 17 seven Thunders utter their voice on the earth the messenger the mystery of God is made known all the Mysteries being finished time is no longer time is no longer because of SE hallelujah amen hallelujah and from that time time is over he's not de dealing with the church no more he's not dealing with no more amen he's dealing with individual because one individual came to Perfection and began a bright age brother said and how can I overcome this is the most glorious age of all amen where time Blends into eternity amen hallelujah so to make it in in continuity with what we have already seen tonight we see from Revelations 101 verse seven brother bam said what is he the attraction on the mountain he said about three years ago he said in 65 which was2 it says about three years ago Revelations 10 1 to7 was prophecy he said it he said now he has fulfilled it God fulfilling his word that is the attraction on the mountain he says now it's history amen this is showing us Christ himself the son of man coming down in heaven cloud and then that sign of the son of man in heaven coming down into a prophet on the earth revealing itself in spirit form in sign form the sign of the Messiah we made known then the mysteries of God third po the opening of the book understand that's amen hallelujah not sh Ministry the revealing of the son of man we look in Revelation 11 let us read Revelation 11 verse verse one and two ghost and there was given me a rod like unto a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God In The Altar and then that worship there in but the court which is without the temple lout and measure not it was given unto the Gentiles in the holy city shall they tread Under Foot [Music] 40s let's read verse three and I will give you power and I will give power unto my two witnesses Hallelujah and they shall prophesy a, 2060 days CL now turn with me quickly to Revelation chapter 13 you can read more of that but we know what Revelation 13 is I want to get to my point here verse five and there was given unto him a mouth this is the image of the Beast it was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy and power was given unto him to continue 40 and2 months now between Revelations 10 1 and Revelations 11 amen Revelations 11 is showing us Moses and Elijah prophesying right the time this power this Beast amen this Reviving of the Roman Empire has come back in full force amen just like Titus did and it's going to slaughter according to re everything that doesn't it's a national force and it says that his Reign his power will be for 42 months is that right why do you think brother bam told us that when the bride leaves amen the word the message goes to the Jews the seventh trumpet the seventh trumpet is the same the seventh trumpet to the Jews is the same as the seven seal to the 42 months Jerusalem is given to the Gentiles To Tread it under foot Revelation 13 42 months not the different 42 months it's the same 42 months Revelations 11 Revelation 1 now it says two witnesses going to prophesy for a th 200 60 days amen the Jewish calendar a month is exactly 30 days amen hallelujah now times 30 times 42 42 months what do you get days Elijah are going to be preaching to the Jews are going to be receiving this Wordle Church God is gonna turn his back on the Gentiles he gonna go to the Jew but during the same time just like in the book amen there going to be a kill there to be a Slaughter just like Titus United the armies and brought this SL so it is already amen understand what I'm saying Revelations 11 is exactly Revelation 1 it's showing you a different viewer but between Revelations 10 1-7 Revelations 11 there is Revelations 10 ver 8 to 11 and in there is where John top of the Bride is taking the book eating the book digesting the book being persecuted because of the book Hallelujah hallelu bitterness pers the Prophet this is not my interpretation and prophesying again final the world he said not just one place just one nation but he said proph again before many peoples Nations tsal to the final age the world will again hear directly from godu through the members of the church will amen there we see again scripturally position the book of after the son of man Titus right right there in Revelations 10 after the son of man Revelations 10 17 and before times between there father thank you in this for your word the word is precious the word is perfect the word oh God
