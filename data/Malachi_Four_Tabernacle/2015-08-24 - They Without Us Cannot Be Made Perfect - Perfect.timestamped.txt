[4:04] book of Acts that while Peter yet spake
[4:07] these words the Holy Spirit

[4:14] that one day he come up to the platform
[4:18] knowing that there was a great need in
[4:21] the
[4:22] bodies many lay in

[4:34] there and he said I did it purposely
[4:37] just preached the
[4:39] word not even laid my hands or did

[4:46] word the sick begin to be
[4:50] healed they begin to come off of those
[4:52] stretchers oh God you said your word and

[5:53] good to be in the house of the Lord It's
[5:55] get to come
[5:57] and receive
[6:00] it's refreshing amen the presence of God
[6:03] amen amen I I really enjoyed last night
[6:07] myself the presence of
[6:11] God as brother Frank said there at the
[6:14] end you know this kind of services that
[6:18] you just don't want to leave
[6:20] and I guess we started at 4: yesterday
[6:23] right brother Frank and service in at
[6:26] about 8:00
[6:28] so amen amen uh I believe
[6:33] that if we can just unite our faith and
[6:37] pull together with the word that God
[6:42] would bring a great blessing to us this
[6:44] morning amen it's good to see our
[6:46] brother Chris
[6:48] Long bless you brother amen and just all
[6:52] the saints amen that here with
[6:55] us uh let us as we're standing God bless
[6:58] you
[7:01] let's open our
[7:03] Bibles in Psalm
[7:09] 105 then I I overheard a little bit of
[7:14] brother Bill
[7:16] was expressing there and we were talking
[7:20] last night there at the dinner
[7:23] table about the things that is
[7:25] prophesied in the
[7:28] scripture what R said concerning
[7:31] this this economic collapse that is
[7:35] coming and we I believe we're close to
[7:38] that back home we've been preaching on
[7:40] another subject of Joseph
[7:44] Perfection and amen we have gone into
[7:48] those areas of the word where Genesis 47
[7:53] the Bible says
[7:54] that they all came to Egypt and their
[7:57] money they they declared our money
[8:00] fath right our money is worth nothing no
[8:03] more and they gave themselves as slaves
[8:06] to the system of
[8:07] Egypt and I believe that's exactly what
[8:10] is prophesied in the word for this last
[8:12] day but we have a promise in that hour
[8:16] amen that what we have seen temporarily
[8:18] will be manifested in the fullness of
[8:21] its power and that's the power that I
[8:24] believe that is to lead us and create in
[8:28] US amen
[8:30] that that Faith right now amen I believe
[8:34] that power has been loosed right yes and
[8:36] it's here now to create that faith in us
[8:39] amen that perfect Faith amen amen and
[8:43] this is why this is a time of
[8:46] preparation this is a time of
[8:48] preparation amen amen and as that quote
[8:52] uh in the message
[8:53] testimon brother Braham said my fear
[8:57] that this is coming is not because
[9:00] uh I'm scared of it but I'm afraid that
[9:04] many people are not ready they're not
[9:07] prepared and this is preparation time
[9:10] right yes this is time to get Amen in
[9:14] Connection in line with the word and
[9:17] with God Amen this is the time of
[9:20] preparation amen and many times as
[9:23] brother B says we don't we don't get
[9:25] into that desperation amen he says it's
[9:28] just in human beings to wait for the
[9:30] state of emergency right but I believe
[9:33] the bride of Christ has made herself
[9:36] ready amen she's preparing herself
[9:39] because we have been given something to
[9:41] prepare us amen right so God bless you
[9:45] uh I trust that we all come expecting
[9:48] this morning and and just allow him to
[9:52] minister to our hearts amen I really
[9:54] appreciate the fellowship and and
[9:57] the the time that we have had and just
[10:01] the open door and the invitation God
[10:04] bless everyone
[10:08] Psalms uh
[10:14] 102 Psalm
[10:16] 102 we begin reading from the 13th
[10:21] verse Thou shalt arise and have mercy
[10:24] upon
[10:26] Zion for the time to favor her
[10:30] amen yes amen yay the set time is come
[10:35] praise the Lord how many believe that
[10:37] Amen brother said who is the New
[10:40] Jerusalem it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[10:44] amen she is the one that bears his name
[10:47] Bears his life and bears his children
[10:50] amen so the time
[10:53] appointed the set time to favor her has
[10:56] come amen this is this hour that we're
[10:59] living for thy servants take pleasure in
[11:02] her Stones amen amen oh my her
[11:06] Revelations amen that's right and favor
[11:08] the dust thereof oh my so the Heathen
[11:12] shall fear the name of the Lord and all
[11:15] the kings of the earth thy Glory yes
[11:18] amen when the Lord shall build up
[11:21] Zion he shall appear in his glory how
[11:25] many believe that he has appeared in
[11:27] this hour in his glory amen amen he said
[11:31] he would appear the second time without
[11:34] sin amen and the appearing of Our Lord
[11:38] Has Come
[11:40] amen when the Lord shall build up Zion
[11:43] he shall appear in his glory he will
[11:44] regard the prayer of the destitute and
[11:47] not despise their prayer isn't that
[11:50] wonderful amen amen this shall be
[11:53] written for the generation to come
[11:57] notice for the generation
[12:00] to come and the people shall which which
[12:04] shall be created amen hallelujah shall
[12:08] praise the Lord hallelujah see this is
[12:11] an hour of creation I believe in the
[12:14] spiritual realm
[12:16] amen what did the opening of the word do
[12:20] to the Bride of Jesus Christ it
[12:23] creates
[12:24] Perfection it creates a perfect
[12:27] atmosphere where the word can be
[12:29] manifested amen is that right didn't
[12:32] brother bam say not ones at the end time
[12:35] that the first pool was Divine Healing
[12:37] amen and the second pull was the
[12:39] discernment then he said third pull is
[12:41] the opening of the word amen we believe
[12:45] that part right there is that spiritual
[12:49] loosing of the holy spirit amen amen the
[12:52] spirit of Truth am to bring the children
[12:55] of God to Perfection to bring the
[12:58] children of God
[12:59] to that place amen where we are created
[13:03] like Christ Jesus amen amen Paul said in
[13:07] Ephesians we are created amen we are his
[13:10] workmanship created in Christ Jesus amen
[13:15] to the good works that were already for
[13:19] ordained amen before the foundation that
[13:21] we should walk in them amen so this is
[13:25] this is what David under the inspiration
[13:28] of the Holy SP spirit is speaking here
[13:30] in Prophecy and then he says this for
[13:33] Heath looked down from the height of his
[13:35] Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord
[13:38] behold the earth oh my I love this verse
[13:42] 20 and this is what we're focusing on
[13:44] right here verse 20 to hear the groaning
[13:49] of the
[13:50] prisoner to loose those that are
[13:54] appointed to
[13:56] death to declare the name of the Lord in
[13:59] Zion and
[14:00] praise in Jerusalem now let's go
[14:04] to let us go to Psalm
[14:09] 118 see to loose those who are appointed
[14:12] to death how many know that the Bible
[14:14] says it is appointed unto man once to
[14:18] die and after this the Judgment amen
[14:20] yeah so we are all appointed to death
[14:23] sentenced to death because of the Fall
[14:27] amen right
[14:30] so God has come down in this last day to
[14:34] loose us from that sentence Oh My
[14:38] hallelujah how many believe that how
[14:41] many believe that there's got to be a
[14:43] people living on the earth that will not
[14:46] see death
[14:48] right amen didn't he say didn't the
[14:51] bible say that that time would come that
[14:54] we which are alive and remain to the
[14:57] coming of the Lord amen amen we'll be
[15:00] changed is that right so we see that
[15:04] this is what the scripture is speaking
[15:05] of we're loosed from that sentence of
[15:08] death and then again in Psalm 118 it
[15:11] says uh
[15:14] verse
[15:16] 17 I shall not
[15:19] die but
[15:21] live and declare the works of the Lord
[15:27] amen the Lord hath chastened me sore but
[15:31] he ha not given me over unto
[15:34] death open to me the gates of
[15:36] righteousness I will go into them and I
[15:39] will praise the Lord the Gate of the
[15:41] Lord into which the righteous shall
[15:43] enter amen there's ministered unto us an
[15:47] entrance amen amen is that
[15:51] right I will praise you for thou Hast
[15:54] heard me and art become my
[15:56] salvation the stone which the build
[15:59] Builders refused is become The Headstone
[16:02] of the corner yes this is the Lord's
[16:05] doing it is marvelous in our eyes yes it
[16:09] is this is the day which the Lord hath
[16:11] made amen we will rejoice and be glad in
[16:15] it Heavenly Father we thank you Father
[16:18] for the reading of your holy and
[16:20] precious word we ask Lord that you bless
[16:24] it and give us the context of it father
[16:27] bless us together in Heavenly places now
[16:28] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:32] amen you may be
[16:40] seated I like this I'd like to for us to
[16:44] turn to the book of Hebrews chapter
[16:48] 11 how many believe that this
[16:51] is an hour of
[16:55] perfection brother says how many believe
[16:58] in dispensation
[17:00] yes he said there's been a dispensation
[17:01] of the law amen there's been a
[17:05] dispensation of Grace or of the
[17:09] churches he said this is the
[17:11] dispensation of adoption
[17:14] amen we are living in that time this is
[17:18] that age this is that that era whatever
[17:21] you want to call it amen this is that
[17:24] season in which the children must become
[17:28] right been
[17:29] mature this is the age when we saw one
[17:33] in our day as we were saying last night
[17:36] that came to full
[17:39] maturity when he came to that full
[17:42] maturity it reproduced Christ remember
[17:45] that again amongst human
[17:48] beings amen and that reproduction of
[17:51] Jesus Christ again is exactly what the
[17:54] scriptures tell us
[17:56] about that is promised for the Church of
[18:00] Jesus Christ to come to that Perfection
[18:03] until we all come unto the stature of a
[18:07] perfect man is that
[18:09] right and we cannot come brothers and
[18:13] sisters to
[18:15] Perfection and that's the very reason
[18:18] why God had to restore the word amen and
[18:23] give us a perfect word a perfect
[18:27] interpretation of the the word because
[18:31] how could we come to Perfection if the
[18:33] word wasn't perfected in its
[18:37] interpretation in other words how can we
[18:41] come to Perfection only with half of a
[18:44] gospel how could we come to Perfection
[18:46] only with Luther's message of
[18:48] justification how could we come to
[18:50] Perfection only with with Wesley's
[18:53] message of sanctification we needed a
[18:56] perfect word that's right we needed a
[18:58] perfect message amen we needed a prophet
[19:02] to rise and come on the scene to restore
[19:05] the word of God to us amen and he said
[19:08] in uniting time and sign to bring back
[19:11] the scattered word amen he sit down
[19:14] seven angels from heaven and he sent the
[19:17] book down to the seventh angel Amen to
[19:20] reveal it to his people you see this the
[19:24] very purpose and the reason why God has
[19:27] put this message it has come across our
[19:30] path has been put in our hands amen
[19:34] that's why brother bam said I believe
[19:37] these tapes will fall into the hands of
[19:40] the predestinated amen yes sir amen and
[19:44] it has fallen in our hands amen amen did
[19:46] it fall in your hands amen amen did it
[19:49] fall in my hands amen yes it has come
[19:52] for a
[19:53] purpose and this is God's for ordained
[19:57] Plan before the foundation of the world
[20:00] so when we when we look here in the book
[20:03] of Hebrews Paul is speaking of the great
[20:05] Heroes of Faith amen yes and here he is
[20:10] beginning with the very creation
[20:12] itself amen faith is the substance and
[20:16] we know what brother B taught us about
[20:18] that that's the logos amen that's the
[20:21] that's the very Holy Spirit itself
[20:23] that's the six sense the holy spirit
[20:26] amen it's a substance it's not
[20:28] imagination no it's not a feeling it's
[20:31] not it's something amen that is settled
[20:35] in the soul brother said that is
[20:38] connected with the word of God it has
[20:40] been revealed to you amen amen what is
[20:43] to come to pass before it
[20:46] does then we see that he he goes on with
[20:50] the Heroes of Faith and he talks about
[20:52] all these these these great these great
[20:55] Heroes of Faith
[20:57] amen and
[20:59] we want to go
[21:01] down we want to go down to verse
[21:10] 39 verse
[21:12] 39 and these all having obtained a good
[21:15] report through faith receive not the
[21:18] promise see this is what he's talking
[21:20] about this is the Old
[21:22] Testament this is the Old Testament
[21:24] saints that did all these things yet
[21:27] without the holy
[21:29] Spirit
[21:31] right they didn't receive the promise
[21:33] the promise was this is what all they
[21:36] prophesy this is what they spoke of this
[21:39] is what was to come amen and that was
[21:43] the coming of the Holy Spirit and the
[21:46] last one to prophesy of that was John
[21:49] the
[21:49] Baptist you
[21:51] see and then Jesus told the disciples
[21:55] the spirit of Truth amen shall come it
[21:58] is with you now it is with you but it
[22:01] shall be in you amen yeah so that is the
[22:08] promise that yet with all that they did
[22:12] and and and performed
[22:15] manifested without the promise verse 40
[22:19] God having
[22:21] provided some better thing for
[22:26] us that they
[22:29] without us should not be made perfect
[22:33] yes sir
[22:34] amen oh my now how many believe we have
[22:38] an absolute in this
[22:40] time how many
[22:43] believe that in the days of
[22:46] Ephesus in the Ephesian
[22:49] church amen anyone that
[22:54] would
[22:56] speak yes they PR prove those that
[22:59] called themselves Apostles amen and they
[23:03] found in Liars is that right Amen
[23:06] brother bams tells us how they did that
[23:10] right and they they checked whatever
[23:14] Minister would
[23:16] preach by Paul's message yes sir sir if
[23:21] if they weren't saying what Paul said
[23:24] they were
[23:25] Liars that's right sir is that right
[23:28] amen so I I believe we can all agree on
[23:31] that amen sir we have we have a perfect
[23:35] resting place yes we have a place amen I
[23:38] believe that this message is the
[23:40] fullness of Christ amen I believe that
[23:43] this message is the perfect
[23:45] interpretation of God Amen I believe
[23:48] that this is where we can lay our soul
[23:51] and rest on the word of God and truly
[23:53] have faith in what we are seeing and
[23:56] hearing and receiving in our soul am
[23:59] amen that's the beauty of of of of
[24:03] having amen an absolute that we can tie
[24:07] our soul to the word of God that's the
[24:10] beauty of it we don't have to rest on
[24:12] what somebody else thinks about it we
[24:14] don't have to rest on what somebody else
[24:16] interpretation is we can rest our soul
[24:20] upon the pure
[24:22] unadulterated word of
[24:24] God is that right amen and that's what I
[24:28] believe the bride of Christ is trusting
[24:30] in in this hour amen not what I can try
[24:34] to understand or or receive you know
[24:38] some kind of intellectual understanding
[24:41] amen hallelujah but the revelation of
[24:44] Jesus Christ brother said any Revelation
[24:48] amen must go from Genesis to Revelation
[24:52] what he say and and he said if it
[24:53] doesn't lay it on the shelf and leave it
[24:55] alone yes amen right so when we when we
[25:00] look at what brother man talked about
[25:02] Revelation he said Revelation is
[25:05] sovereignly given amen amen he said and
[25:09] who is this MZ re the Revelation itself
[25:12] is Sovereign amen he reveals to whom he
[25:16] will is that right he hides it from from
[25:19] the wise and the BR and reveals it unto
[25:21] bab such as with
[25:23] learn amen and brother said we can only
[25:27] speak and me what God has revealed to us
[25:30] yes sir that's right he said we must be
[25:33] inspired to speak the word of God Amen
[25:37] and we must speak under divine
[25:39] inspiration and
[25:41] Revelation that's why each one of us
[25:44] should have a testimony as as the
[25:47] scripture says to give amen a witness of
[25:51] the hope that lies within us amen is
[25:54] that right
[25:55] yes be ready
[26:01] if God has given us something he has
[26:03] placed something in our
[26:05] heart amen God is creating something
[26:08] inside of us that's that perfect faith
[26:12] in a perfect word amen for a perfection
[26:16] in this
[26:17] hour see so if we look at this scripture
[26:23] Hebrews
[26:25] 11:40 and we see that it's speaking
[26:30] of a a better thing for us that they
[26:34] without us should not be made perfect we
[26:36] want to know what the Divine interpreter
[26:38] of the word said amen amen is that
[26:42] righten and brother Bram said the
[26:44] prophet is the Divine interpreter of the
[26:45] word amen amen no one has a right to to
[26:49] judge or
[26:52] question the authority of a prophet
[26:55] amen and it's not our job job to try to
[26:58] reason it out we just we just look at
[27:01] what he said about the word and we

[1:24:02] Witnesses amen 2 Corinthians 13 amen
[1:24:06] I've read a lot more quotes than
[1:24:09] that brother keep saying the same thing
[1:24:12] over and
[1:24:13] over amen look what he says stat of a
[1:24:17] perfect man I like this one because we
[1:24:20] have we have an idea and I I I want to
[1:24:23] hurry up here we have an idea many times
[1:24:25] that all we need and it's true we need
[1:24:27] faith we need a Doctrine amen right
[1:24:31] that's right yes sir but sometimes we
[1:24:35] think that's all we
[1:24:37] need look what brother says right here
[1:24:39] in the Statue of a perfect man is this
[1:24:40] okay come on amen he says remember what
[1:24:44] Paul says that's a perfect man said over
[1:24:46] here in Hebrews
[1:24:48] 11 he says let me read it for you so
[1:24:51] brother R reads Hebrews 11 32-40 the
[1:24:56] scripture we
[1:24:57] read and he follows it with this
[1:24:59] statement right
[1:25:01] here right after he reads it he says do
[1:25:04] you get
[1:25:05] it those people who
[1:25:07] died are depending and waiting on
[1:25:11] us so this church has got to come to
[1:25:15] Perfection that's right in order to
[1:25:17] bring the resurrection amen and there
[1:25:20] under Souls under the altar waiting for
[1:25:23] this church to come come to its
[1:25:25] Perfection that when Christ does come
[1:25:28] and this church you see is coming
[1:25:31] smaller in the minority that's right
[1:25:33] it's becoming smaller and smaller he
[1:25:35] says it's a whole lot sharper here at
[1:25:37] the top see then just like right down
[1:25:40] here it comes to a needle
[1:25:43] point until the church in the minority
[1:25:46] has got to get into a place until it's
[1:25:49] the same kind of a Ministry that this
[1:25:53] left that's that's right because when
[1:25:56] this headstone comes back it's got a
[1:25:59] little pocket like in here where it's
[1:26:02] going to sit right in there on the
[1:26:03] regular pyramid it just isn't a cat that
[1:26:07] sits across the top it's a little
[1:26:10] flange that's right and it's got to sit
[1:26:13] on there cuz it sheds the water
[1:26:18] Hallelujah and when it comes this church
[1:26:21] has got to be so home
[1:26:24] all these the rest of the stones in the
[1:26:26] pyramid are laying so perfect till you
[1:26:28] can't run a razor blade between them
[1:26:30] weighing Tong weighing laying in there
[1:26:32] how they got up them up I don't they
[1:26:34] don't know but they were built and up
[1:26:37] here when the pyramid cat does come the
[1:26:41] pyramid itself the body of Christ will
[1:26:43] have to be home not just some Creed or
[1:26:48] doctrine that's right or something other
[1:26:51] that we come through you see that's
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:55] not just having a Doctrine or a Creed or
[1:26:58] something not just
[1:27:00] that it will have to be perfectly like
[1:27:05] Christ when he comes he and that
[1:27:08] ministry will fit right smack together
[1:27:11] see then will come the
[1:27:14] Rapture and the going
[1:27:17] home Hallelujah can you say Amen
[1:27:20] church that stone questions and
[1:27:22] answerers 64 this one's a this one's a
[1:27:25] stinger watch out now come on questions
[1:27:28] and answer 64 y it will only fit on the
[1:27:32] top
[1:27:34] foundation that stone will not fit there
[1:27:37] on the bottom foundation on the second
[1:27:39] foundation on the third Foundation it'll
[1:27:41] only fit on the top foundation amen now
[1:27:44] listen to this brother Joe he says when
[1:27:46] the entire building has become fitted to
[1:27:49] the stone and Jesus cannot come until a
[1:27:53] church Church come on a body of
[1:27:58] Believers and the ministry that he once
[1:28:01] had will have to be the same as it was
[1:28:04] then amen and then that brings that's it
[1:28:09] them without us are not made perfect
[1:28:13] Paul said in Hebrews 11 without us they
[1:28:16] cannot be perfect that's right they this
[1:28:19] last day group they must have this
[1:28:23] ministry

[1:41:27] requiring of of us in this
[1:41:31] day Paul

[1:41:43] is
[1:41:46] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:41:49] away so all these little things are
[1:41:51] jumping up and down like a kid trying to
[1:41:53] talk in tongues and these are the things
[1:41:56] when that which is perfect and we do
[1:41:59] have today by God's help the perfect
[1:42:03] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:42:06] Vindication

[1:42:44] around with every R of
[1:42:47] doct someone comes up with
[1:42:50] something and they're strayed that way
