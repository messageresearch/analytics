Joseph Typed in The Lord Jesus Christ
Joseph Typed in our prophet, Brother Branham
Joseph Typed in the Bride

Now, therefore on the Word; it's beautiful. Now, we're faced this morning and got before us under consideration to my opinion one of the most vital texts of the Old Testament. Joseph we're going to speak on meeting his brethren. 

80  There could be a hundred different ways that the Holy Spirit get into this and unfold it to our hearts and mind.
   
56-1230 - Joseph Meeting His Brethren
   Rev. William Marrion Branham

… there for four hundred years, in bondage, how Joseph, perfect type of the church today, perfect type of Christ, how that He was borned among some brethren, half brothers; and they despised Him because He was borned a spiritual man. Like the true believer tonight, being a member of the church, member of the same body, but a spiritual believer, rejected and despised. Amen.

And as Joseph was a type of Christ, he's a type of the church which is the body of Christ on earth today. Beautiful. Wish we had time to go into it; dig out those golden nuggets of the Bible.

the season tells us what condition the fruit is supposed to be hallelujah hallelujah and brother ROM said in 62 planting time is over amen amen no more planting time he says now you have to wait for this to grow and you know what he said in 62 in the same year that he said planting time is over he said five stars have appeared in the heavens and these five stars have aligned themselves he says when Jesus was born three stars were aligned that was showing that the Messiah was on the earth brother Bram was born three stars align showing the same Ministry coming back again but he said this it's not three stars this is five stars in the heavens he said this is the sign of an infant bride hallelujah hallelujah a baby bride amen just like when Christ was a baby these three stars align he said this is a sign and he said th say the lord it's infant Hallelujah he says but I believe there's coming a great thing amen and this years ahead and he said and this will raise this bride from an infant bride Hallelujah this is the hour of Let Us open our Bibles God bless you Genesis 49 amen word amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord I trust that we can have a good time tonight in his presence in his word rejoice as we see his word just become so real to us just want to speak a little more on this subject Joseph in Perfection amen and verse 2292 Joseph is a fruitful Bowl even a fruitful Bow by well branches run over the wall archers have Sly grieved him and shot at him and hated him but his bow AB in strength and the arms of his hands were made Strong by the hands the Mighty God of Jacob from hence is the shepherd the stone of Israel even by the god of thy father who shall help thee by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of Heaven above and blessings of the deep that Li under blessings of the breast of the womb blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the Everlasting Hills they shall be on the head of Joseph on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren John chapter 15 if you would tonight St John chapter 15 very very tremendous portion of scripture not not only because what it but also because of where it's placed we see in minute what I mean verse one the true B I am the true B and my father is the husband every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that be fruit he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are children through the word which I have spoken unto you you're clean I'm sorry abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me hallelujah amen I am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and man gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me my words abide you you shall ask see you shall ask that is amen that is the evidence of abiding you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here in is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so ye shall be my disciples amen heavenly father thank you Lord for your blessed word God we ask that you father just bless it to our hearts Lord may you bless us together in Heavenly places may be you father Lord quickening this word to us tonight God take away father weariness Lord anything that would try to hinder your word father Lord if we are here to waste our time then father it's better that we leave but father if we are here with the desire in our hearts to really receive from you tonight Lord may you help us Quicken us father and Lord May our attention be set upon Thy Word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen am may be seated we find Jacob blessing Joseph giving the prophecy over his life giving him prophetic utterance showing that he is seen he is seeing what he is speaking amen he is in a vision realm he is in the realm of Revelation he is in the realm of vision and as he seen how many times we know brother brandom uh we have heard him or seen him on video how we see him how he's seeing something in a vision and he says I see this and this I see this and this because he is speaking what he is seeing in the vision and this is what Jacob this is the kind of anointing that Jacob was under in Genesis 49 and he is blessing his 12 sons when he comes to Joseph he he begins to proph under Vision amen of this Great Vine amen that Joseph is or a great Branch amen it's the same word that is used for the what they made in the Feast of Tabernacles Leviticus chapter 23 26 and this is where uh this comes from it comes from the word Branch amen and that's why he is calling Joseph amen not only a branch first he says what Joseph is a branch amen and then he says he is a fruitful Branch amen by a well then he shows how that when this Branch becomes [Music] fruitful amen it begun it begins to go over the wall hallelujah hallelujah this is very tremendous amen and I hope we're spiritual enough to be able to catch amen what is in this great mystery brother said it's Christ revealed in his own word if you can't see Christ every verse in every personage of the Bible go back and read it again because there he is hidden but revealed in Simplicity and he is hidden in his word but he is revealed in his own word and Christ is the mystery of God revealed and within Christ there was another history another mystery that was hidden inside of him how many know what that was remember what brother R said he said inside of him was you inside of him was me inside of him was the bride inside of him was another mystery that was hidden so in other words if we find Christ then we can find ourselves hallelujah amen if we find him in the scripture we can find ourselves in him in the scripture you understand and that's why these types amen for instance we talk about Abraham amen Abraham is a type of priz is that right brother said when he went to go save his his nephew lost when he was in trouble he said I was a type of Christ going to save the human race when it's in trouble he said that wasn't Abraham that was Christ in Abraham the power of Salvation so Abraham is a type of Christ and then if you go further mam said there's never been a messenger to the last days with his name ending in H a.m amen seven letters Hallelujah the number of God six letters the number of Man Billy Graham but he really he really wasn't talking about Billy Graham he said he was down in Sodom but he was really saying Bram yes sir seven letter so when he talks about Abraham he's a type of Christ but he's also a type of the Prophet is that right but then he goes on and he says Abraham is a type of the believer was justified in Genesis 12 brought out of Bon he was Sanctified Genesis 15 Hallelujah under the unconditional Cen is that right and under Genesis 17 it's the great the pcal power amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said in the fourth stage amen Abraham as a Believer he sees the last to the Gentile world before the fire falls he says he says he sees El a prophet the last World hallelujah hallelujah yes sir so you see that when you take a person in the Bible and you type him he types Christ he types the prophet and he types you because the mystery of God revealed is Christ but the mystery of Christ is theah so when you see that when we're looking at here at Joseph he types Jesus is that right amen is he a type of Jesus is he the perfect man is he Perfection hallelujah hallelujah to God Amen is he the one in the midst of seven golden candlesticks Revelation one that's him that's Joseph glory to God now notice during this time there was a mystery unfolding in the days of Joseph what was that mystery amen that God God's predestinated plan it's always evolving it's always unfolding whether people recognize it or not and that is the reason why God's word it's always based on principles Hallelujah you as a Believer have to have principles and know the principles of God's word that's what brother R was trying to teach the Pentecost amen he was trying to show him principles he said the Pentecostal church is the church that's the most loose of all churches he said because they have no principle he said but God is wanting to bring the church to matur amen a people with principles of people that knows what the word say and we ain't depending upon how I feel what I think or how I look at there's got to be principles there's principles in a local assembly there's principles while the word is going forth he said the spirit of the prophets amen is subject to the prophet is that right so while the word is going forward he said the Holy Spirit working over there is for some to speak through somebody is that right is that a principle he said the Holy Ghost is speaking here and youve got to wait until he's finished speaking here right and when he finished here whatever he wants to do over there is that right those are principles that we have to know in the word of God because if not we're just loose we're just loose we do what we want oh I feel like this I feel like that but when we go to principles we tie our soul what the word say hallelujah this is what this message come to bring us it come to bring us principles in our home principles in our Liv principles in the church principles in our Christian walk amen solidly depending upon the word of God and when we see the principles of God we understand his mind we understand his mind we understand his plan Hallelujah huj and then we know that the same hand to God the same hand that's leading me listen the same hand that's leading us once in a while is going to spank us and then once in a while that same hand is going to pick us up and then that same hand is going to raise us up and then that same hand it's going to break [Applause] us and then that same hand is going to take the broken pieces and put them back together do you understand those are principles and when we don't understand principles we're loose we don't know we don't understand why this why that why am I going through this why does this have to be hallelujah hallelujah but when we understand principles we know it's the tender head of the Amen brother said the critics look back to the Inquisition where Christians were in Lion's in the great Roman circus and killed little children killed wives killed amen women and families ding for the cause of Christ so Anointed with the O anointing of sacrifice that history says that when those that were looking for the Christians passed by they would come out say we're right here hallelujah hallu they were so Anointed with thato they were willing to give their Liv Hallelujah and brother say the stands and he writes a book The Silent God Amen the silent God how could a loving God a God that opened the red SE God that did Wy signs and miracles let his children go through that and die and stand there he said with his arms crossed and not do nothing he said the caral Mind does not understand amen that the seed has to fall [Applause] incept am brother said you know what that was those Millions died he said that was the tender hand Hallelujah you see what I'm saying principles when you understand principles amen you don't question godl you know exactly why he's doing what he's doing you know that he's going to pick you up you know he'll never leave you never forsake you amen but you also know the other scriptures that say he that I love I and Hallelujah hallu so you know principles you're not just wanting one part of the pie Hallelujah you want the whole pie amen hallelujah to God and we noce thank Lord that this message teaches not only in Word word but indeed the very life of the prophet of God shows us God showing him principles and then him testifying of those things that we might see that it's not only God dealing with a person in the Bible how many understand understand that that when God dealt with Abraham in that certain way it wasn't only just for Abraham it was so that somebody else that's going through the same thing can see how God work with here right someone that can't have a child he can go back to Abraham and take that word and say God work there take that up and say that's for me is that right a woman like Sarah can go back to the Bible amen and see God did that for S it for me you see what I'm saying he he not only does that for the person that that is in the scene but it's Christ fulfilling that amen amen for future events Paul said in Corinthians 10 all of these things are for our example hallelujah amen hallelujah so we see then that even in the life of the Prophet many things God dealing with him is so that you in this age in this modern time amen we can look back and see that's the first grain of wheat amen that's a Son of God predestinated to this age and he's going through Tri he's going through things but look how God shows him and reveals to him and brings him amen this is why brothers and sister when we look at the principles of God brother said if we work a certain way if he worked a certain way back there when a certain situation rose up amen and he says and then the same situation Rises up over here he's got to act the same way he acted over is that right amen is that right Hallelujah now brother and sister when we're not we're not founded upon those principles we're we're we're not spiritual minded to go back and look for those things that we're going through in the word we think nobody ever went to what we're going to that's true we think that there's no examples that nobody understands us and that there's nothing in the word that can help us you see what I'm saying it shows our narrow mind amen but I believe that everything that the predestinated seed of is going through amen it's in the word of God hallelujah hallelujah that we can go back to the word and draw virtue from what God did in those times in those situations amen and say did it for him do it for me did it for her do it for me amen hallelujah you understand Glory look at the prophet he'd read Moses he'd see his ministry he'd see his birth see amen is that right Glory he go back to Abraham he see himself in there amen he' see himself in Gideon he see himself in Joshua he himself Ines he himself in Adam amen Hallelujah to God see in looking for a bride amen the word of God you understand and when we go back to the word there's parts of the life of mes that apply to you there parts of the life Jos that apply to you there's part in the life of Jesus that applies to you amen but if you notice brother took the types greater thanom Is Here greater than Jonah is here amen greater than all of them is here what about the bride in this house greater than Eve is hallelujah because this bride will not fall Hallelujah am amen what about the bride a greater than Esther a greater than the queen of the sou amen a greater thany amen it's [Music] here God hallelujah you understand can we can we identify with Mary amen reing the word in her womb to bring forth the first coming amen that is the beauty of the word being open hallelujah hallelujah now notice this I told you this morning brother said this story of Joseph can be taken aund different ways that's what he said then we see of Christ amen the typ of the Bride amenu now listen in this time The Book of Life is being unfolded in the days of Joseph is that right why names the book are coming to the Earth to fulfill the predestinated word for that hour is that right was there names in the book coming forth in the days of of Joseph am Hallelujah brother taught us in the sman church Ag and the Sardis Church AG he said there were two sections to the book One Amen in the lamb section that cannot be raised other the other section that can be raised he says and then there's a third group that never was on the book and he said such as Pharaoh amen amen so he's he's showing you something he's showing you something he's not just mentioning Pharaoh just to mention Pharaoh right showing you that during that time Pharaoh didn't even come to be in the book but Joseph was the elected one in amen amen and there were some that did good to Joseph amen and they came into into Liberty into salvation into the kingdom because they did good to [Applause] Joseph amen is that right and then there were some who were saved and some that were lost amenah yes amen the baker his name was erased but the butler he was on a different section Hallelujah you see what I'm saying Joseph the elected in that age his life was the mystery of Christ being revealed his name was in the lamb section he is the bride type amen he is the spiritual one Amen in that time he is the one that reflects Christ during that time you understand not everybody in that time was reflecting Christ they all were doing a part and in this hour not everybody is reflecting Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah not everybody's name is in the lamb section amen some names right now being erased that's what the prophet [Music] Tien not they're going to be erased they're being erased right now and there's names being called manifest oh

the holy spirit inside how many knows that the holy spirit is a great well is the great Fountain how many knows amen that God put the first man and he planted him in the garden of by fountains you know what the Bible says sometimes we just see well it's just Waters or Rivers no go back to the Bible the Bible says that from the Garden of Eden amen amen those Rivers were born amen hallelujah is that right am does the bible teach that all the rivers brother no matter where they are they have a place where they start is that right they have a part where they're born amen is that right maybe

he planted Adam amen amen Jesus speaks all about this in the gospel every plant that my father did not plant amen shall be plucked up is that right and cast into the fire so who plants the father right who predestinated us the father from where from before the foundation of the world now notice Joseph is a fruitful Branch amen planted by the well you understand now notice brother when we look at this we begin to understand now all right then I can see how that is a type of us today the bride is by the well the spirit the prophet and the bride say come and drink from the water amen is that right amen all right look what brother Brown says in the message the Masterpiece he says Jacob means deceiver means deceiver that's what he was but it was God's grace that was with him but when it comes to Joseph there's nothing against him just one little for the foundation listen because the foundation must also be a masterpiece brother brother is saying that God laid the Foundation right like Michel Angelo for the foundation to build the Masterpiece right and then when he built the Masterpiece he struck it amen right he told it to speak well look what brother R is saying here brother R saying the foundation was the Patriarchs amen amen Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph that was the foundation he said so the foundation brother the foundation amen when it came to its Perfection Joseph had one little scratch because the foundation must also have a scratch in it you see what I'm saying because the Masterpiece what made it a masterpiece brother said what made it the master was the strike on the knee right amen so the foundation is a masterpiece also because Joseph has a little scr Hallelujah you see now look he says he says that was when his he told his father the prophet so Joseph's father was a prophet oh my hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and his father how many he know that the prophet said you are my children in the gospel Hallelujah and if we are his children remember in the days of Jesus Amen Mary came and his brothers he said hey Jesus your mother wants to talk to you and your brothers Glory he turned around and said who is my mother who is my brother who is my father but them that do the will my father is hallelujah oh brother because the Bible says that even Jesus own carnal flesh brothers did not believe in him amen amen now look right here we see amen he said Joseph's father he told the prophet say to Pharaoh that your people are cattle raisers not Shepherds because a Shepherd is an Abomination to the Egyptians but when the old prophet before Pharaoh he said your servants are herdsmen so it scratched it it was a little scratch in the Masterpiece it says that's why it still makes it the Masterpiece the foundation is laid through faith love Grace and Perfection amen Abraham Isaac Jacob and Jose Hallelujah a masterpiece the foundation now listen Hallelujah he says here I read this uh this morning she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just the same as Joseph was smitten from his brother amen because he was the word so notice that in the days of Joseph he was the word hallelujah am Pharaoh wasn't the word [Applause] glory amen the rest of them work the word hallelujah Joseph was the [Music] word amen and because he was the word Jesus was smitten from his Brethren because he was the word and the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there's your stages again exactly hallelu he says the the word living in action the Bible bride not some manmade bride the Bible bride spitten Afflicted of God Amen in this hour remember the prophecy of Jacob over Joseph said that the crown would be on his head Joseph him that was separate from his brother remember what we said this morning amen that that meant set apart Nazarite for a specific work am but notice that he says the crown of the head of him Hallelujah you see huj because it's in the head it's the crowning time it's the Capstone amen hallelujah didn't brother say I want God to Crown my Ministry amen how how he said by dressing his BR Hallelujah hallu glory to God and

something look look what brother R says I I just I just want to read this quote and then Master peace paragraph 136 he said justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in perfe yes sir Hallelujah back to the word again he said see it's the stock the T the husk amen then we see that it comes to the grain oh my to prove it's wheat how many know that you don't you can't know if it's wheat in the stock amen or the tassel amen or or the shock is that right

getting much fruit amen it's getting [Music] laid hallelujah hallelujah oh my but it's growing it's growing hallelujah hallelujah and it goes over the wall this is this is what Jacob is seeing in the vision when he's blessing Joseph he says you're a Vine you're a fruitful Vine and the vine amen the Branch goes over the wall notice look at this carefully Joseph had stages in his life leading him into Perfection he wasn't born in per Perfection no there was stages in his life that led him amen little by little until finally came to the right hand right hand is Authority now listen brother this

seed amen oh brother the same seed that went in the ground has to come back out at the top of the plant see it cannot be half a seed it's got to be all of this you say I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah I believe in speaking with tongues that's just part of the SE but now there is added to that hallelujah hallelujah the life not the gifts the life of the gifts you see what I mean we're at the end time amen she is dead ripe about the bride brother amen the word has become blessed exactly like he promised in Luke 17 Mal and Revelations amen was he that Branch giving the fruit was all Roberts giving fruit hallelujah hallelujah was all Robert the original SE all robbert was Billy graah that original he was the only one that was revealing that he was the first one that reach that proved he was weak why because the Same Spirit Glory of Jesus Christ the same she that went in the came back out in his life and R Messiah he said the Al has become the first and the last the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the [Applause] same Hallelujah now noce brother this is why we we have to catch amen amen the the very purpose of what is laying in this mystery of Joseph invisible Union paragraph 221 but remember when it went down the grain the grain begin to ripen before that grain can ripen the stock has to be dead hallelujah hallelujah you see where it's standing and the shock has to be dead to God everything else has to be dead because the life is in the grain hallelujah hallelujah pente is dead no life hallelujah hallelujah B is dead the life was there it passed through there Hallelujah and while he was there amen that was God's mouth brother said that he said those who were under Wesley's message were the voice to their generation under Wesley amen he said but then again there will be a people in the land in the last days that under their message not above I've never taught that we're above the prophet never because it's it shows amen that the bride has to be under Authority it has to be under an amen if we don't have an absolute then we're just loose amen just dangling around amen but when you got an absolute said what is the abolute Hallelujah your soul it's time AB I say tonight that my [Applause] soulall that's the reason why she will be the final voice to the final age under her mess but he says she says the spirit the prophet and the pr [Applause] how did I end up there look I'm talking look at this he said the life is in the grave just exactly listen like the same grain that went the ground now the same Jesus in Bride form come back you see it's the same one that went in and when it come out what did it show Brother people testified people wrote people went to meetings because they saw God in that man yes sir amen people wanted just to touch him because they seen christall that's the grain that's the gra pulls away and the grain Hallelujah is showing same Jesus again in this house you understand but then there's this next part that brother Bram shows us the same grain of wheat went in the ground comes back up it's the same Jesus in Bride form he says the same power the same church the same word notice it's forming the head for the rat hallu Hallelujah all right now notice brother so when we look at this are we understanding so far Joseph is perfection and when his Branch or when he is reaching maturity amen when he's going over the wall amen is showing it's showing something what is he showing brother he showing this that until that the [Applause] Propet reach maturity he couldn't cross the Wall of the natural to the supernatural it was a wall brother yes sir and that wall is what held back the ages seven Church ages they would come to a certain point and there was a wall they couldn't pass Hallelujah every age in every age because why the branch has to come to maturity it has to grow it has to give much fruit but you know what what did we read in St John 15 what did we read in John why does it give much fruit brother brother Steve he's a gardener right why does fruit trees give more fruit amen because the husbandman does something to the tree right or or does he just L leave says if it's going to give fruit going to give fruit hallelujah hallelujah no no right am what do we read in St John 15 amen he has to purge what is purge mean trim it Hallelujah am he has to trim it and when he trims it what is that it's suffering hallelujah it's persecution hallelujah it's being in the valley hallelujah it's being rejected amen yes sir you know what that is when that's happening in your life God wants you to give more fruit Hallelujah Hallelujah he wants you to get more fruit so he chop you here he chops you over here hallelujah hallelujah he Cho your finances Oh Glory and then that makes you say oh Lord see you begin to give more fruit when he CH you up Hallelujah do we need that do we need some some purging hallelujah hallelujah what does John 15 say look look at Joseph brother before he could come to the Palace before he could come to the right hand of pharaoh he had to be rejected amen amen he was predestinated to reach that place he was going to reach it no matter what but he had to pass through this he had to rejected of his brother brother said hated him without a CA they hated him without because he had spiritual vision because he has spiritual dreams spiritual visions the church has got to come to the real amen of Revelation and vision hu amen the church comes into the realm of Revelation Vision it begins to see scpal Hallelujah scriptural Revelation oh my begins to unfold and he begins to tell his father and his brother begin to hear amen they begin to say no who does he think he is what is he saying what is this that he that that he's talking about now this Revelation and this this stuff that he's talking about what's that amen hallelujah hallelujah that's where rejection comes that's where hallelujah hallelujah amen but those dreams he doesn't ask for he doesn't say I want to dream sheep stars and everyone bowing to me right he doesn't say that it's God that gives him those dream amen does he want the dream dream does he make the dreams manufacture them oh no the dreams are given sovereignly by God and all he can do is just speak what he sees in the dream oh glory amen all we can do is just speak what we see in the word hallelujah what is sovereignly given said Revelation is Sovereign Hallelujah now notice when he looks in the stages of his life the visions that they reject is not and the condition listen this is I'm be closing with this listen close the Visions the dreams that his Breen reject are not dreams visions of what are going on right then and there no those are dreams visions of his life in the future amen but he already seeing [Music] it am he's already catching a revelation before it comes to pass amen amen and that's what they reject that's what they re they say how can it be look look at Joseph we're going to bow down look at him it's just a boy you see because in their minds all they can see is the present is what's happening there J condition but Joseph's dreams and Visions brother they're looking to his predestination they're looking to his position in right hand ofth but listen brother this is a this is a great lesson hallelu and the great lesson is that afterwards Joseph understands that all this was for a purpose and when that time comes of economic recession it's in it's in the story of Joseph you know what the story of Joseph says read it it's strong that's why I believe this subject is real deep because the story of Joseph says now listen to me now that when the time of depression came starvation amen amen they came to the Kingdom of Egypt and they said we want bread because money the Bible says our money fails in other words money wasn't worth nothing you believe there's coming a repeat of it is that going to happen again is is these dollars going are they going to have value no sir these the these these $100 me a a't trash it's coming a time like that you understand what I'm saying amen amen but in that time it shows that Joseph had the had the spirit of Christ at first he was a little angry right but but then he gave him bread because he was under that Authority he gave to his Brethren that I rejected him he gave him bread because he had bread amen hallelujah he had a place Hallelujah where everything else fails this doesn't fail in this Kingdom amen does not depend on the economy of the world it doesn't depend on the stores of this world Amen brother Brown said the church got the quot brother Brown said the church has got to come to a place to reproduce the Loaves and Fishes again hallelujah huj amen hallelujah yes brother and sister this is the time hallelujah hallelujah that when we come into these Visions when we come into these things many times the prophet wasn't understood because he was speaking with such urgency with such conviction like if it was already there hallelujah hallelujah but yet what he was speaking he was seeing in a vision something way ahead but he was saying get ready now but leave it now get ready now Hallelujah I believe that same anointing is here nowu to show us the time Hallelujah stand to your feet oh my do you believe it Church oh many many things that that we want to speak on this subject but so far we can see how perfect it [Music] ISU amen amen do you believe it amen musicians come do you believe God's word do you believe these things are realu believe these things are taking place now Hallelujah this is why brothers and sisters when we see this vision like Joseph he can't help but speak what God shows him amen said in the message the token I can only speak what he reveals to me Hallelujah I cannot speak for somebody else I can't speak for some other thing but as he opens his word and reveal that's what I can speak is that right that that might be helpful might be edifying for others you believe that okay hallelujah hallelujah look at the stages in Joseph's life leading to [Music] Perfection he had grown from the stock in the father's house [Music] tassel in parer's house then into the shock in the prison house but finally into a ripen sheath remember his dream was he a she genesis7 it was a ripen she hallelujah hallelujah that means he was positionally [Music] placed and his brothers bowed down to him did you know brother BR said in the P Vision did you know he said right now they call you holy Ro and they make fun of you he says because this is man's dayu he said but in the day of the Lord in the day of the Lord they will bow to your feet what he said that's what the prophet of God said he what happened with Joseph did they make fun of him before did they persecute him before or in the Lord's day what was the Lord's Day this is perfect catch it now don't miss it Revelation one Hallelujah where was brother Bram C up yes when he come to maturity didn't he go into that cloud Hallelujah didn't he say that cloud is what John saw Revelations one and what did John say I was in the spirit on the Lord's day you see what I'm saying it doesn't fail brother it's perfect and brother Ram said right now they make front of you but right now they call you holy Ro but in the Lord's Day will bow your feet in other words when you come to positionally place Hallelujah when you come to be caught up in that cloud Glory when you come to the Lord's day so he went from his father's house he was born in his father's house were you born in your father's house were you born in the kingdom of [Music] God and then from being born there he was rejected he was taken slave totter first house Hallelujah and in's House's wife amen wanted to
