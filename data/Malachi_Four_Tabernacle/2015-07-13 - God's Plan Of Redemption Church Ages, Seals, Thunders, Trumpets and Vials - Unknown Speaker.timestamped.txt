[0:00] woe woe to the
[0:01] inhabitant of the Earth by reason of the
[0:05] other voices of the trumpets of the
[0:08] Three Angels which are yet to
[0:22] sound you may be seated God bless
[0:26] reading of his word
[0:28] tonight
[0:34] amen how many you happy to be in the
[0:36] house of the Lord tonight
[0:38] amen amen I trust we come
[0:42] expecting to receive from him
[0:46] tonight his
[0:48] word be inspired by Revelation to our
[0:54] hearts amen
[0:56] amen we trust that if you in any
[1:02] way
[1:04] uh still have not
[1:08] understood what these trumpets are
[1:12] about or don't have a clue what it
[1:16] is I trust that the Holy
[1:19] Spirit give you that
[1:22] understanding it's just it's very simple
[1:25] it's just a subject that is uh not
[1:29] entered into to
[1:32] because of the statements brother Bron
[1:36] makes uh when he says that these seven
[1:39] trumpets have nothing to do with the
[1:43] church and it's concerning
[1:46] Israel so people
[1:49] immediately have nothing to do with
[1:52] it and it causes
[1:55] many to leave this subject
[1:58] alone or not even to look into it but
[2:02] when you look
[2:03] carefully you'll find that it is a
[2:07] mystery Amen in this great uh subject of
[2:13] the seven
[2:15] trumpets we want to begin by noticing
[2:19] here
[2:21] tonight and those of you who
[2:24] understand the difference between
[2:27] preaching and
[2:28] teaching
[2:30] you'll understand that this is
[2:33] teaching this kind of uh
[2:37] subjects it has to be brought in this
[2:42] manner that you would
[2:44] understand how exact the word
[2:47] is where
[2:50] exactly uh the scriptures tied
[2:55] together what brother Bram said
[2:57] concerning this subject
[3:00] and how it all ties in under a
[3:04] supernatural thing for the Bride of this
[3:06] last
[3:09] hour amen because it's always literal
[3:12] God deals with the Jews in a literal
[3:16] standpoint he always deals with him
[3:19] naturally he always dealt with him
[3:22] naturally he always will deal with him
[3:25] naturally but he deals with the Gentiles
[3:28] in a supernatural way
[3:31] he deals with us in a spiritual
[3:33] way he gave them a natural Temple he
[3:37] gave them a natural lamb gave him
[3:39] natural
[3:40] candlesticks gave him natural priests he
[3:44] gives us a spiritual Temple he gives us
[3:47] a lamb of God that was slave for the
[3:50] sin of the world understand he gives us
[3:54] a spiritual
[3:56] blood we don't have to be sprinkled by
[3:58] Blood literally
[4:01] we believe in the blood that was
[4:03] shed and that's the blood that cleanses
[4:05] us
[4:06] today it's a spiritual thing you
[4:10] understand and we Are Spiritual
[4:13] priests amen we are a spiritual
[4:16] House We Are Spiritual
[4:19] Temple we are the Temple of the holy
[4:22] spirit so all these things we can see
[4:25] that it is natural to the
[4:28] Jews and spiritual for the Gentile
[4:32] church so when we look when we're
[4:34] looking at this subject the seven
[4:37] trumpets we're looking at the literal
[4:40] thing that is has dealt and will deal
[4:44] with
[4:47] Israel and that in the natural
[4:50] standpoint then we are also
[4:53] seeing amen if you have by now
[4:57] already that this is dealing with the
[5:00] Gentile
[5:01] bride in the spiritual standpoint in
[5:04] this
[5:05] hour do you believe that say amen amen
[5:10] now just because this is teaching it
[5:13] doesn't mean that you don't have to
[5:15] interact
[5:18] amen we like
[5:21] interaction brother said shows that the
[5:25] holy
[5:27] spirit that is moving in your heart
[5:30] if you really believe that and you
[5:32] really have a conviction of
[5:34] that he said the holy spirit that wrote
[5:37] the word will say Amen to the word of
[5:41] God amen amen and it takes a real amen
[5:44] from the
[5:46] soul to show that evidence
[5:49] amen is that what the prophet said so
[5:52] God in his
[5:54] word amen God revealing his word and
[5:59] that same God is revealing the
[6:01] word if that Holy Spirit is in you it'll
[6:05] say Amen to his own
[6:07] word hallelujah hallelujah now we we
[6:10] want to
[6:12] see first of
[6:14] all how many know what the book of
[6:16] redemption pertains
[6:19] to the book of
[6:21] redemption is given to the human race in
[6:24] the beginning of
[6:27] Adam in the Garden of Eden
[6:30] because it is a title deed to the
[6:33] Earth you understand amen this is a
[6:37] whole
[6:38] purpose of how God is Redeeming the
[6:41] Earth he's redeeming his church by water
[6:45] blood and
[6:46] spirit he will redeem the Earth he's
[6:49] already brought water he's already shed
[6:52] blood upon the
[6:53] Earth and he will bring fire to cleanse
[6:57] it amen this is the same way the work of
[7:01] redemption he does to the personal
[7:05] believer amen so we see that the book of
[7:10] redemption it's a
[7:12] Plan of
[7:14] Redemption with three with a three-fold
[7:18] purpose amen and this book of
[7:22] redemption was lost in the beginning
[7:25] because Adam sin he disobeyed
[7:28] God amen so that book wasn't some
[7:32] literal book that he was carrying
[7:35] around amen it was a supernatural
[7:40] book because these is the
[7:44] thoughts this was is what was in the
[7:47] mind of
[7:48] God before the foundation of the
[7:50] world is is his Plan of
[7:54] Redemption so this went back into the
[7:58] hands of the original owner
[8:00] amen it was stayed there until the time
[8:05] that it was to be claimed
[8:07] back for Redemption
[8:10] purposes Hallelujah so first of all the
[8:14] Lamb of God Jesus Christ the son of God
[8:19] had to come to redeem us back to
[8:23] God by the blood of the Lamb there was
[8:27] no other way Redemption
[8:30] purposes but through the blood of God
[8:34] himself the book of Acts amen Paul says
[8:39] we are
[8:40] saved by the blood of
[8:43] God amenu and then we find that that was
[8:47] the very blood the very life of God
[8:51] himself it was
[8:53] zo that's what makes the blood of God
[8:57] and as we said earlier
[8:59] amen amen that is what cleanses us
[9:02] today not a literal sprinking of a
[9:06] blood it's the life of that blood that
[9:10] cleanses us from within hallelujah
[9:14] hallelujah and and what I just uh quoted
[9:17] to you that Paul says is the blood of
[9:20] God it's in the book of Acts chapter
[9:24] 20 amen verse 28 where he says take heed
[9:29] that to all the flock over which the
[9:31] Holy Ghost has made you overseers to
[9:34] feed the Church of God Amen which he had
[9:38] purchased with his own
[9:50] blood amen amen so it's the Church of
[9:55] God the one that he
[9:57] purchased with his BL it's the blood of
[10:01] God and it's the Church of God Amen that
[10:05] we're speaking of is that right so we
[10:09] see that then the blood of the
[10:11] Lamb God made man to pay the Supreme
[10:17] price Hallelujah and then when in
[10:20] Revelations chapter
[10:22] 5 you have to follow me quickly here
[10:26] amen then we see in Revelation CH 5 most
[10:31] of us know this but maybe there's a few
[10:35] here that would like to know what we're
[10:37] talking
[10:39] about have a
[10:42] clue but listen in rev chapter
[10:45] 5 we find that the the
[10:49] lamb John is crying and and he and he
[10:53] sees that there's one sitting on the
[10:57] throne and he has book in his hand
[11:00] brother tells us this was the original
[11:03] owner is that right the book went back
[11:06] to
[11:07] God and then John begins to
[11:11] cry and we see in verse four he weeps
[11:14] and he there's no one worthy to open the
[11:18] book then we see in verse five that one
[11:20] of the
[11:23] elders comes and tells him not to cry
[11:27] anymore because the lion of the tribe of
[11:31] Judah the root of David have prevailed
[11:36] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[11:40] Seals amen and then what he sees there
[11:45] is a lamb in the midst of the throne
[11:48] with seven eyes and seven
[11:51] hores of course this is
[11:53] symbolic but really it's the
[11:56] lamb that comes forth
[11:59] out of the intercessory throw to take
[12:02] the book out of the hand of the
[12:06] original said the lamb that took the
[12:08] book was the one that had been
[12:09] interceding for our sins for 2,000
[12:16] years so it was not just a spiritual
[12:19] thing it was the actual body of the Lord
[12:23] Jesus
[12:24] Christ and have been
[12:26] interceed for me and you the church ages
[12:31] but now the time had come amen that he
[12:34] was to to come off of the throne
[12:37] Hallelujah after Serv Church
[12:40] changes and take the book Hallelujah and
[12:44] not only take the book but now he had to
[12:48] come down to the Earth to make
[12:51] claims of what's in the book in other
[12:54] words what's in the book amen needs need
[12:59] to be
[12:59] claimed because in there is his eternal
[13:02] box of
[13:04] redemption his attributes his children
[13:08] the Earth itself is in that book you
[13:12] understand not only people not only his
[13:15] church but the Earth also it's the title
[13:19] deed to the Earth amen and it's the book
[13:24] that's got the names of his people of
[13:28] his seed
[13:29] of his children I'm just trying to make
[13:31] it simple so we all can
[13:34] understand amen so then you see that now
[13:38] the lamb has to come
[13:40] down and begin this work on the earth
[13:44] you understand but he cannot come down
[13:48] in a physical form so then we come we
[13:52] come over now if you like to look there
[13:55] in Revelation
[13:57] 10 verse one then we find that it's a
[14:02] mighty angel coming down from heaven clo
[14:07] with the cloud and a rainbow is upon his
[14:12] head you understand and what does he
[14:15] have in his hand he has in his hand
[14:19] verse two a little book with the book is
[14:23] open and says it's the same book that
[14:28] was in rations 5 that was closed it was
[14:31] sealed and there was no one worthy to
[14:34] open it but the lamb came forth to take
[14:38] the book and broke the shields there but
[14:42] now we see that he had to come down to
[14:45] the Earth to make this work of
[14:48] redemption amen what he paid for 2,000
[14:52] years in physical for now he's going to
[14:56] claim hallelujah amen in another form
[15:00] down here on the earth he is claiming
[15:03] his
[15:04] subject it's the ti amen not of paying
[15:09] the price for Redemption oh that's
[15:12] already been paid but now it's a time to
[15:16] claim what's in the book Hallelujah gory
[15:20] to God and not only that it's time to
[15:23] claim the
[15:24] Earth Oh Glory
[15:27] Hallelujah so he comes down in Angelic
[15:32] form this Mighty Angel brother Adam said
[15:34] is
[15:38] christu you say well I thought you just
[15:40] said that the lamb over there was Christ
[15:44] yes but this is his spiritual
[15:47] form hallelujah hallelujah this is him
[15:52] in the form of the great
[15:54] logos the the the the beginning of the
[15:57] creation of God
[16:00] amen Piller of fire amen coming down to
[16:05] do this work but
[16:08] then in this book in this form this
[16:14] angel had a a a mysterious way of
[16:22] speaking hallelujah amen amen and John
[16:25] heard what he was mysteriously
[16:30] saying and he was told not to
[16:33] write what this one says right here in
[16:37] verse
[16:38] three he cry cried with a loud voice
[16:42] that's when a lion roar amen
[16:47] am see amen amen and when he had
[16:53] Pride seven
[16:55] Thunders UT their
[16:57] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[16:59] out their voices I was about to write
[17:02] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[17:04] to me seal up those things which the
[17:06] seven thund uttered it right them
[17:17] not see how simple that is
[17:21] hallelujah so he's not permitted to
[17:24] write these mysterious
[17:27] things that this Mighty Angel is
[17:29] speaking Christ
[17:32] himself John hears it amen amen he's in
[17:36] a vision but he's not permitted to
[17:39] write because in the whole book of
[17:41] Revelations he's just writing what he
[17:43] hears and what he
[17:46] sees understand so then what does the
[17:49] scripture
[17:50] say it says that this Angel put one foot
[17:54] on the lamb one on the sea lifted up his
[17:56] hand sweared by him that liveth forever
[17:58] and ever
[18:03] that time should be no longer then what
[18:06] is verse 7 say you see we in the message
[18:08] we just hear Revelation 107 Revelation
[18:13] 107 what is it
[18:15] mean it's not just a quot just a
[18:19] scripture it's not just like you hear
[18:21] everybody you know in Christian Church
[18:23] say John 3:16 John
[18:27] 3:16 amen M what is John
[18:32] 316 you see it's not just something to
[18:36] quote or learn or
[18:39] know it it it means something so
[18:43] Revelation 10:7
[18:45] says that this that John wasn't
[18:48] permitted to
[18:50] write in the
[18:52] days of the
[18:54] voice of the seventh
[18:57] angel when he shall begin to sh the
[19:03] mystery of God would be almost
[19:09] finished it doesn't say that right maybe
[19:12] I'm reading
[19:14] wrong it says the mystery of God would
[19:20] be
[19:23] finished as he have declared to his
[19:25] servants the prophets
[19:29] amen amen so you see then that's
[19:34] where the prophet of the
[19:37] age brother Bram his
[19:41] ministry was speaking these
[19:45] things
[19:47] that the angel was
[19:50] speaking and John
[19:53] heard and he wanted to write see but in
[19:57] the days
[19:59] that this message would begin to
[20:03] declare amen amen those hidden
[20:08] things amen amen because it would be the
[20:13] end time
[20:15] M amen would be
[20:17] finished because in there is where the
[20:23] the the
[20:25] power of Revelation is
[20:29] hallelujah
[20:30] hallelujah that's where there is
[20:33] something that was to come in the last
[20:37] days Jesus called it the spirit of
[20:42] truth and the spirit of Truth would lead
[20:46] us to all
[20:47] things it would show us all things it
[20:50] would reveal to us all things it would
[20:53] show us the plan of God it would show us
[20:56] the plan through the Earth
[20:59] would show us the plan for our Liv it
[21:02] would show us the The Plan of
[21:05] Redemption who we are and where we come
[21:08] from and what we're doing here and why
[21:11] were we born in this last day and why is
[21:14] the world going to end and why is there
[21:17] so much Evil all of these things are in
[21:22] the message of the
[21:24] hour amen but it must be received
[21:29] by
[21:30] Revelation it takes the same listen to
[21:33] me it takes the same
[21:36] spirit that was giving it through the
[21:40] prophet and takes that same power to
[21:44] reveal it to
[21:45] you Hallelujah it takes the same
[21:48] anointing it takes the same Angel it
[21:52] takes the same power it takes the same
[21:56] Revelation it takes the same
[21:58] anointing Amen to reveal it to
[22:03] you
[22:04] see and that's
[22:07] why we
[22:10] must look for
[22:12] that we must seek for
[22:15] that we must want to have a desire in
[22:20] our
[22:23] hearts amen a
[22:26] hunger to know these things
[22:30] amenu and that's why when we begin to
[22:33] understand a little bit we begin to hear
[22:36] a little bit of what this
[22:38] is then we want to know
[22:41] more amen then we want to know
[22:44] more then we want to know more and
[22:48] more because God begins to renew our
[22:51] minds says the
[22:55] Bible amen amen all his word so
[23:03] listen a part of that Plan of
[23:06] Redemption amen
[23:09] amen where where is the Plan of
[23:11] Redemption
[23:12] here in the book of
[23:15] redemption you with me
[23:17] tonight so part of that
[23:20] plan remember the book was seal with
[23:22] Seven Seals
[23:24] right part of that
[23:26] plan is
[23:29] called
[23:31] ages amen hallelujah part of what was in
[23:35] there is called
[23:37] ages but that's just a
[23:42] terminology that's just a name that is
[23:46] given to
[23:49] dispensations that have already passed
[23:52] from the days of Paul to
[23:56] now we know that
[23:59] because a Prophet come and showed us
[24:02] what that
[24:04] was but I want you to understand
[24:06] something
[24:07] tonight I want you to
[24:10] understand one
[24:12] thing that when you look at the
[24:16] ages you have to have you have to know
[24:20] this amenu what do you have to know that
[24:24] that is part of the Plan of Redemption
[24:31] and that part has already unfolded
[24:36] itself you understand that is something
[24:40] that was inside of the
[24:42] book amen part of the plan is called
[24:48] seals amen part of the plan it's called
[24:53] V amen see but just like you you might
[24:58] say well what's
[25:00] vies the same thing like someone else
[25:02] that don't know what ages is will say
[25:04] what's
[25:07] ages amen because they don't know you
[25:12] see what I'm
[25:13] saying but
[25:15] people it seems on the
[25:18] message all they all they want to
[25:22] know and all they know is just ages
[25:28] amen amen then when you then okay ages
[25:32] yeah I know ages I'll tell you messenger
[25:34] how many ages there
[25:38] is I'll tell you the dates I'll tell you
[25:41] what happened they know that you see
[25:45] what I'm saying but talk to somebody
[25:48] about
[25:50] seals see it's part of the
[25:54] plan no no that's too deep why too deep
[25:58] it's part of the
[26:01] plan the ages is deep for some people
[26:04] out there that don't know nothing about
[26:08] it amen amen they'll probably look at
[26:11] you like you some kind of you know Bible
[26:14] teacher in college or
[26:17] something if you begin to tell them see
[26:20] there's Church seven Church age look
[26:22] right here in the Book of Revelation two
[26:25] you know who that angel was Paul
[26:28] say what you
[26:29] talking how do you know how do you make
[26:33] that
[26:34] interpretation that doesn't say that
[26:36] Paul is there it doesn't say Paul's name
[26:39] there right how do we know how do we
[26:43] know a Prophet come to open that part of
[26:46] the mystery you understand I'm just
[26:49] trying to make this as simple as
[26:51] possible because it it seems as though
[26:55] when we mention seals B TR people oh
[26:58] what's
[27:01] that it's part of the
[27:03] plan
[27:05] Hallelujah see amen part of the
[27:09] plan what's part of the plan part of the
[27:13] Plan of
[27:14] Redemption Hallelujah and part of that
[27:17] plan is called
[27:19] Ages part of that plan is called
[27:22] seal that plan is called
[27:25] trumpets wow seven Thunder
[27:28] is what
[27:30] reveals the
[27:32] continent Hallelujah of the entire
[27:37] booku am did you get that am the seven
[27:43] pns is what
[27:45] reveals the entire continent what
[27:48] contained in the entire
[27:51] book Hallelujah so it takes those seven
[27:55] thund it takes that super natural
[27:58] Revelation Hallelujah to let you know
[28:03] amen the mystery is
[28:06] finished for many the mystery still
[28:10] ain't
[28:12] finished Revelations 10 says it would be
[28:16] finished but how come people are still
[28:20] waiting for something
[28:21] else because it ain't finished for
[28:26] them but yet
[28:28] the
[28:29] finishing is already finished it's the
[28:33] message of
[28:34] the Hallelujah did you understand you
[28:37] understand what I'm saying
[28:39] right how come people are still waiting
[28:43] the mystery of God to be
[28:48] consumed you see what I'm saying it's
[28:51] already
[28:52] consumed and then someone might ask them
[28:54] what is
[28:55] it well that's the thing
[28:59] amen what it is has got to be revealed
[29:02] to
[29:05] you
[29:07] right so hallelujah amen glory to God
[29:12] when God brings the full
[29:14] word full

[29:28] Myst is
[29:30] finished hallelujah hallelujah amen
[29:35] amen to God you understand say amen
[29:39] amen but people get caught up with
[29:44] symbols they get caught up with
[29:47] terminology they get
[29:51] scared just when you mention Thunders oh
[29:54] what's
[29:55] that oh what's
[30:01] you see amen
[30:04] notice if we look back in the Old
[30:07] Testament in the life of Abraham in
[30:10] Genesis you'll find the church
[30:13] ages amen
[30:16] hallelujah how do we know that has the
[30:19] mystery been
[30:22] opened amen you can look at the life of
[30:26] Abraham
[30:28] in the Book of Genesis and you can read
[30:31] chapter
[30:32] 12 amen and you can know that's
[30:36] justification that's
[30:40] Luther you can read chapter chapter
[30:44] 15 hallelujah amen and you can
[30:48] know that that's Wesley Wesley that
[30:53] sanctification amen
[30:55] amen and then you can you can read in
[30:57] Genesis
[30:59] 17 and another as the great El
[31:02] sh the
[31:05] almighty the power of
[31:08] Pentecost the
[31:10] restoration of the
[31:12] blessings of Pentecost the restoration
[31:16] of the
[31:18] gifts amen
[31:20] amen but how come you can see that AMJ
[31:26] it doesn't say
[31:28] Pentecost in Genesis
[31:31] 17 it doesn't say Church ages from
[31:35] chapter 12 to to chapter
[31:39] 17 amen
[31:42] hallelujah but those things are
[31:46] terminologies ages is a
[31:49] terminology of an
[31:51] [Applause]
[31:53] occur right Hallelujah seal is a
[31:58] terminology it's a name that's given to
[32:01] something that has taken
[32:04] place Hallelujah so whether you call
[32:07] it what all that's taking place or you
[32:11] just call it
[32:14] ages see instead of having going through
[32:17] the whole
[32:18] description amen you just say Seven Ages
[32:23] and while you say Seven Ages it covers
[32:26] everything that
[32:27] happened within the Seven Ages
[32:31] hallelujah amen you
[32:35] understand hallelujah hallelujah then
[32:38] when we see in Genesis
[32:41] 18 God coming down in a
[32:45] man the form of a prophet so Abraham
[32:49] give him the last
[32:51] sign before the
[32:53] change they receive the body the change
[32:56] of their bodies
[32:58] to receive the promised
[33:00] son then you know there's brother R's
[33:03] ministry right
[33:05] there did you know that that we have to
[33:09] receive a change of our
[33:12] body Bible doesn't say they receive a
[33:14] change of their
[33:15] body but it does
[33:18] describe Sarah at 9 something years old
[33:23] going down there with
[33:25] Abraham to care
[33:28] and falling in
[33:30] love a king with a lot of money falling
[33:34] in love with an old
[33:38] granny she wasn't no old
[33:41] granny her body was
[33:43] changed Hallelujah
[33:47] again but it doesn't come out and tell
[33:50] you was an old granny or she was young
[33:55] she just tells you it just tells you how
[33:56] old she was but that's how the Bible is
[34:00] you little
[34:01] details that only by Revelation for you
[34:06] can pick those things up and see that
[34:08] it's in
[34:11] there amen so you can say change the
[34:15] body amen and then she had seven more
[34:22] children Abraham had seven more children
[34:25] after that
[34:27] amen amen yes see then you can type
[34:31] Isaac as when we will receive Jesus
[34:34] Christ in the
[34:36] air you
[34:38] understand it's the same
[34:40] mystery that's over here in
[34:43] Revelation is the rapture in
[34:48] Revelation it is the body change in the
[34:51] Book of
[34:52] Revelation yes it is is the church ages
[34:56] in the Book of Revelation
[34:58] you see what I'm saying it's the same
[35:01] thing that's over here in
[35:02] Genesis just with different Nam
[35:05] different stories different things that
[35:09] what it's speaking over here in
[35:10] Revelation it's the same
[35:12] thing it's the
[35:15] mystery this is what this message come
[35:18] to reveal
[35:20] to when you listen to the message Christ
[35:24] is the mystery of God
[35:25] revealed brother brandom says this great
[35:30] mystery is what God has
[35:33] showed through every type in the
[35:37] Bible every person in the
[35:41] Bible every story in the Bible was
[35:44] speaking of
[35:48] this see then you won't read it like
[35:52] some little Sunday
[35:55] School like a cute little
[35:59] story you'll read it by
[36:03] Revelation amen you see what I'm
[36:06] saying now
[36:10] look this is
[36:12] why it's
[36:14] types Shadows
[36:17] symbols
[36:19] examples amen hallelujah just like when
[36:22] we spoke of
[36:23] Joseph they get himself known to his
[36:25] brothers
[36:27] it doesn't say uh Feast of
[36:31] atonement
[36:33] right but that's what it
[36:36] was see Joseph's
[36:39] brothers being gathered back to
[36:42] him it's the Feast of the
[36:44] trumpets but it doesn't say that in the
[36:47] Genesis
[36:50] account no no but in
[36:53] Revelations it's called ages it's called
[36:57] seals it's called
[37:00] trumpets see it's part of the
[37:04] plan it's part of the
[37:06] mystery you understand say
[37:11] Amen all right so that's why since we've
[37:15] been on this
[37:17] subject of the seven
[37:20] Trumpets the seven
[37:22] trumpets seems to be very a very my
[37:26] serious
[37:29] subject to
[37:31] many because of the
[37:34] statements that brother Bram
[37:37] made when he said it has nothing to do
[37:41] with
[37:44] us that's what he said he said
[37:47] us then he also said it has nothing to
[37:50] do with the
[37:53] church
[37:55] Etc he said it pertains to
[38:00] Israel amen amen the people say
[38:04] Okay trumpets pertain to
[38:07] Israel has nothing to do with me
[38:11] although that's part of the
[38:13] mystery listen now trumpets is part of
[38:15] the
[38:17] mystery amen you see and the whole
[38:21] mystery has to be
[38:24] finished amen hallelujah
[38:27] to
[38:29] who to the one that is to be
[38:33] redeemed see
[38:36] amen then brother let me read those
[38:39] statements
[38:41] brother right here in the message Fe of
[38:43] the
[38:44] trumpets 44 he
[38:47] says he says now coming to this part
[38:50] here the preaching of the seven
[38:53] trumpets I thought well I'll not try to
[38:57] think
[38:58] anything I'll just wait till that time
[39:01] and let him reveal it to
[39:04] me then
[39:06] yesterday when I went into the
[39:09] room wondering why they before
[39:14] yesterday to try to
[39:17] understand it was
[39:21] there where the Holy
[39:24] Spirit open
[39:27] this opened up this to show me the
[39:31] reason that it it is not profitable even
[39:34] for the CH church at this
[39:41] time
[39:43] hello it's not profitable even for the
[39:48] church at this
[39:51] time it cuz it has nothing to
[39:55] do with the church at
[40:00] all Fe of the
[40:02] trumpets paragraph
[40:06] 145 now the reason that these seven
[40:09] trumpets does not apply to this
[40:12] church and this age is because it's to
[40:17] Israel
[40:19] only it's the
[40:21] calling the Gathering of the
[40:24] people now there's only one significance
[40:27] in
[40:28] here that I want to get to in a few
[40:32] minutes is where you'll
[40:35] see why this doesn't apply to this age
[40:37] that we're living
[40:39] in the seven
[40:42] trumpets amen amen you see
[40:47] so okay people say well it doesn't
[40:50] pertain to the church doesn't pertain to
[40:53] this
[40:54] age I care about
[40:59] this is why because of these
[41:03] statements
[41:05] amen amen it cause many to not even look
[41:11] at the
[41:12] subject it causes many not even to get
[41:16] into this
[41:18] subject
[41:20] Hallelujah but when you look
[41:23] carefully Hallelujah
[41:27] amen amen later on he
[41:31] says about a few months after he made
[41:33] those
[41:35] statement recognizing your day and its
[41:38] message Hallelujah he preached after the
[41:41] Feast of the
[41:42] trumpets and he said he revealed to me
[41:47] that the seven
[41:48] trumpets sounded under the six
[41:51] seal and I preached it
[41:54] supernaturally he said see it's the hand
[41:56] of God the whole thing it pertains to
[42:00] Israel and we picked it
[42:03] up under the Sixth Seal you all have
[42:07] that how the
[42:09] persecution of the
[42:11] Jews amen
[42:14] hallelujah so then he he brings in
[42:17] now that there's a supernatural
[42:22] Revelation Hallelujah within the Sixth
[42:25] Seal
[42:26] and this is why that statement
[42:30] alone is what is what moved
[42:34] me to look into
[42:39] this but then we F that was
[42:42] 64 then we find after returning from
[42:48] Africa from returning from
[42:50] Africa brother
[42:52] BR amen amen in 65
[42:57] he wants to set up meetings
[43:00] now to
[43:02] speak on the Trumpets on
[43:06] the listen and the
[43:10] Thunders okay hallelujah what the bride
[43:14] is supposed to
[43:16] hear the Thunders so that her heart can
[43:19] be changed her house her heart ain't
[43:22] changed that's what the prophet said
[43:25] amen the only way that Malachi 4 can be
[43:29] fulfilled is for you to hear the
[43:33] thunder
[43:36] amen amen
[43:38] amen that's th say the
[43:42] prophet which is th say the
[43:46] lordu amen
[43:49] so he says I want to tith I'm going read
[43:52] it to you right
[43:54] now but he says
[43:56] I want to preach on the trumpets I want
[43:58] preach on the vs CU he hadn't preached
[44:01] on
[44:02] them or he did but
[44:07] Supernatural and he says I don't want to
[44:09] preach on the
[44:12] Thunders amen another Supernatural
[44:15] Revelation
[44:18] also and TI in
[44:22] together now he's going to tie in
[44:25] together
[44:27] the trumpets the
[44:29] vs and the
[44:32] Thunders I thought it has nothing to do
[44:35] with the
[44:39] church careful amen I thought it has
[44:42] nothing to do with this then why is he
[44:44] going to tie the Thunders
[44:46] for is the Thunders for the
[44:51] Jews careful how you
[44:54] answer amen
[44:58] look at the message the God of this evil
[44:59] age this is
[45:03] 65 he says now in doing this I have come
[45:06] here for a
[45:09] purpose of teaching the last
[45:13] BS seven BS the last seven
[45:18] trumpets and the last seven
[45:24] thunders of The Book of
[45:27] Revelation tying them
[45:30] together in this hour Hallelujah that
[45:34] we're now
[45:39] living
[45:41] oh in this hour that we're now
[45:47] living to
[45:49] follow the opening of The Seven
[45:53] Seals and the Seven Church
[45:56] in other words I already preached
[45:58] ages prach the the
[46:01] seals amen and this is what
[46:05] follows the introduction quote that I
[46:07] read to begin this subject
[46:11] with amen out of the Ages come the seals
[46:15] out of the seals amen come the trumpets
[46:19] out of the trumpets come the
[46:22] V
[46:24] right see
[46:26] am hallelujah what else did Brother Bram
[46:30] say the message of
[46:32] Shame he says so we will set up those
[46:35] VES and those
[46:37] trumpets and I want to place them
[46:40] in they come under another thing so does
[46:44] the vows come over the sounding of the
[46:47] trumpets but we want to take the entire
[46:51] course right straight through and bring
[46:55] it and tie it in
[46:58] together says it
[47:00] again
[47:01] hallelujah amen
[47:04] amen and the message thinking man's
[47:08] filter he says I'm anxiously waiting for
[47:11] the
[47:12] hour so we can all congregate in one
[47:16] place and preach on those seven
[47:19] PL which are in the
[47:23] vows and the trumpet
[47:26] and so
[47:27] forth they all
[47:30] happened right in a
[47:33] cluster that's the reason it'll take us
[47:36] about a week 10 days or more to get
[47:38] through it in one single
[47:41] meeting we
[47:44] can I think it's very
[47:47] sufficient all right so we see
[47:51] now amen amen that if we don't follow
[47:55] the further statements he made about the
[47:59] trumpets amen amen you'll stay with the
[48:03] idea amen that just leave it
[48:09] alone amen but catch what he said under
[48:14] inspiration is not profitable for the
[48:16] church at this
[48:21] time
[48:23] wasach that Revelation was not
[48:25] profitable for the church at that
[48:29] time amen but now it's profitable
[48:35] Hallelujah because they didn't even have
[48:37] a clue what the seven Thunders
[48:40] was he told them don't even try to get
[48:44] into it just live a good Christian Life
[48:48] and wait and then God will send it
[48:51] [Music]
[48:53] later amen those to show it had to be
[48:59] until this hour it had to be until this
[49:02] time he said when would it be revealed
[49:05] just
[49:06] before or right around the time that
[49:10] Jesus
[49:11] comes for
[49:15] his hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[49:19] you understand now so
[49:22] brother looking into this now we have we
[49:26] have
[49:27] realized amen amen in the past Services
[49:32] now that there has been
[49:35] something
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:38] Supernatural taking
[49:40] place by revelation of the Holy
[49:44] Spirit stay exactly with the
[49:47] message of the hour we see the Holy
[49:51] Spirit taking the scriptures and making
[49:54] them so BL to us as he said the spirit
[49:58] of
[49:59] truth will lead you into all Truth at
[50:03] the opening of The Seven
[50:05] Seals that's Supernatural
[50:09] power brother regardless of what anybody
[50:12] else
[50:13] thinks whether they want to believe it
[50:15] or don't want to believe it whether they
[50:18] want to
[50:20] realize that God is still doing
[50:22] something Supernatural today
[50:25] the same anointing that made the prophet
[50:28] preach him
[50:30] supernaturally it's the same anointing
[50:33] that it's here to reveal it to you if
[50:36] you
[50:37] want in a supernatural
[50:40] way Revelation is not
[50:43] natural Revelation is
[50:46] Supernatural
[50:48] Hallelujah flesh and blood cannot give
[50:50] you
[50:51] Revelation it takes the spirit of God
[50:55] and the the spirit of God is in a realm
[50:57] that's not
[50:59] natural hallelujah it's a supernatural
[51:02] act of
[51:04] God to give you
[51:09] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah so
[51:13] regardless of what anybody else
[51:15] says thinks it's
[51:19] supernatural Hallelujah to see the
[51:23] revelation of what is in the
[51:27] things and this is to confirm to
[51:30] us that we have been
[51:33] called according to his
[51:37] purpose Hallelujah
[51:40] predestinated to be
[51:43] conformed into the image of Christ
[51:46] that's what the Bible
[51:49] say hallelujah hallelujah let's turn to
[51:52] the Book of Romans chapter
[51:54] 8
[51:58] Romans chapter 8 and we read
[52:05] [Music]
[52:10] here 28
[52:14] 29 and verse 30 we know that all things
[52:17] work together for good to them that love
[52:20] God to them who are
[52:22] called according to his purpose
[52:33] for whom he didn't for
[52:35] know he also did
[52:38] predestinate to be
[52:41] conformed to the
[52:43] image of his son amen that he might be
[52:47] the first
[52:49] born among many
[52:54] Breen
[52:58] [Music]
[53:02] for
[53:04] moreover hallelujah amen whom he did
[53:08] predestinate to be conformed to the
[53:11] image they be also called
[53:14] amen and when be
[53:16] called they be also
[53:19] Justified and whom we
[53:21] justifi and he also
[53:24] glorify
[53:33] so what is this showing us this is
[53:34] showing us
[53:36] something if God is revealing himself
[53:41] supernaturally to your
[53:43] heart and you really understand
[53:46] me amen amen I Supernatural Revelation
[53:50] not cuz you're some kind of smart
[53:54] intellectual I mean
[53:58] person I'm not trying to say you're not
[54:02] smart you understand what I'm saying
[54:05] amen but in other
[54:07] words you don't have to go to a Bible
[54:12] College and study the Greek
[54:15] language study the
[54:18] Hebrew study to see if the verses are
[54:22] right and that word's not right
[54:26] that word well it's all right but it's
[54:29] not that verse we don't even know if it
[54:33] was there in the original
[54:37] manuscripts just wasting
[54:42] time amen amen it takes
[54:46] Revelation
[54:48] hallelujah
[54:50] hallelujah God has put into our
[54:54] hands
[54:56] what finishes the mystery of this whole
[54:57] thing right
[54:59] here in the days of the voice the
[55:02] seventh angel we shall begin to sound
[55:04] the trumpet the
[55:06] mystery of God will be
[55:10] finished like I said earlier someone
[55:13] might ask what is it that's
[55:18] thing that's thing but we have in our
[55:22] hands we have it in book form in tape
[55:25] form we have it in all kinds of
[55:30] forms it's in our
[55:32] hands hallelujah hallelujah but that
[55:36] just by reading it intellectually ain't
[55:37] going to help you
[55:41] either because the Bible says Paul says
[55:43] when Moses is read the veil is still on
[55:46] their
[55:49] face he says but when ye shall turn to
[55:52] the
[55:53] Lord that ve that doesn't let you
[55:56] see amen a natural sight can see the
[56:01] letter but a supernatural SES got to see
[56:05] the meaning behind
[56:08] it the inspiration the
[56:11] Revelation amen hallelujah then when you
[56:14] turn to the Lord Paul
[56:16] said and be
[56:17] converted that Veil will be taken
[56:21] off amen it takes the Holy Spirit
[56:25] now notice hallelujah hallelujah amen
[56:29] that's
[56:31] Supernatural that power revealing it
[56:35] regardless of what anybody else
[56:38] thinks it's
[56:40] supernatural I believe that this is to
[56:43] confirm to us that we have been called
[56:47] according to his purpose so that there
[56:50] won't be a doubt in your
[56:52] heart Hallelujah that you have been
[56:54] called called according to his purpose
[56:58] it confirms to us the Covenant that God
[57:02] has
[57:03] made with this Plan of
[57:05] Redemption I have
[57:08] promised I have
[57:10] swore amen that I will do this and this
[57:14] and this and God's word will never
[57:20] fail hallelujah amen he's going to
[57:23] redeem a PR
[57:25] he's going to save a bride he's going to
[57:27] transform a bride amen he's going to
[57:31] have a church without
[57:33] SP he's determined he has SW he has
[57:38] promised glory to God and there's not
[57:41] enough power in this world or enough
[57:44] power in Hell or enough anything to stop
[57:48] that word from coming to
[57:50] pass amen and there's got to be somebody
[57:54] that's to receive it there got to be
[57:57] somebody that's knowing what God is
[57:59] doing in the last
[58:01] day that's got to be sbody that truly
[58:05] knows why God sent a prophet why God
[58:08] sent a message why God sent us Tes why
[58:13] God sent us books amen amen hallelujah
[58:18] to make some
[58:19] tradition it ain't to just make us some
[58:21] other
[58:22] denomination and just quot without
[58:25] understanding like everybody
[58:28] else hallelujah amen the only difference
[58:31] is that they quote say John 3:16 you
[58:34] quote Mali 4 R
[58:39] 10 but it's the same
[58:43] Spirit the bride ain't under that
[58:45] Spirit bride is under the spirit of
[58:48] Revelation under the spirit of Christ
[58:51] see under the revelation of what God is
[58:53] given through the message
[58:56] hallelujah amen glory to God and it
[59:00] ain't just one scripture or two
[59:01] scriptures it's the entire
[59:04] mystery that means that that doesn't
[59:07] mean you have to read the whole Bible
[59:08] now I don't even think I've done
[59:12] that amen I've read I don't know a lot
[59:16] of it hallelujah amen but I've never
[59:20] said well I'm going to read from Genesis
[59:22] Revelations I can understand it you know
[59:24] you need
[59:28] I had Brothers tell me I did that in
[59:30] jail didn't
[59:32] [Music]
[59:33] work still didn't
[59:36] understand amen not about reading
[59:39] everything it's about whatever you read
[59:42] you
[59:44] understand that's the
[59:46] difference that means that what
[59:48] everything you do
[59:50] read Spirit of Christ will reveal to
[59:53] you message of the hour hallelujah amen
[59:58] that's the
[1:00:01] difference that's why remember the book
[1:00:03] of
[1:00:04] Acts that
[1:00:06] un amen amen from queen
[1:00:11] Denise yes in the Bible he was one of
[1:00:14] her guards one of her
[1:00:19] security amen amen he was reading the
[1:00:21] book of
[1:00:22] Isaiah didn't know a clue what he was
[1:00:26] reading that right amen just reading
[1:00:29] reading then hallelujah amen Philip was
[1:00:34] translated in the
[1:00:36] spirit amen and then talked to him and
[1:00:39] said you understand what you're
[1:00:42] reading I'm reading it but I know what
[1:00:44] it
[1:00:45] means remember that
[1:00:47] story Hallelujah he says I have I I need
[1:00:50] someone to show
[1:00:53] me amen amen he said well that's
[1:00:56] speaking of Jesus
[1:00:59] Christ that was to come pay the
[1:01:02] Propet
[1:01:04] die amen for your sins see then he he
[1:01:08] commanded us to
[1:01:10] baptize Hallelujah in his name that
[1:01:13] whosoever shall be baptized shall be
[1:01:16] saved he said here's water to be
[1:01:20] baptized
[1:01:23] heaped see
[1:01:27] because someone had to
[1:01:30] show what was in
[1:01:32] there one that was under that
[1:01:36] Revelation preach that in the message of
[1:01:40] God amen amen and he said that God is
[1:01:44] the holy
[1:01:45] spirit now
[1:01:47] notice he
[1:01:50] says
[1:01:53] oh
[1:01:55] brother Bram
[1:01:56] says that this revelation of this
[1:02:04] mystery this thing that the angel was
[1:02:08] speaking in Revelation 10 that John
[1:02:11] wanted to write this thing that is
[1:02:15] called a terminology that the Bible uses
[1:02:18] seven
[1:02:21] Thunders just made it real simple for us
[1:02:24] say what that
[1:02:27] means means that God is speaking that's
[1:02:29] all it
[1:02:31] means the voice of
[1:02:35] God when Jesus was here on the earth he
[1:02:38] was praying he was getting ready to be
[1:02:42] crucified he said
[1:02:44] father I know that my time is
[1:02:47] coming amen for me to be turned into the
[1:02:51] hands of sinful
[1:02:53] men this ISS in the book of St John
[1:02:57] 12 he said my heart is
[1:03:00] troubled he says but I know I've come to
[1:03:03] the Earth for a
[1:03:04] purpose he said that's to glorify thy
[1:03:07] name I have glorified thy name
[1:03:10] hallelujah amen and he said Lord just be
[1:03:14] with me and he was
[1:03:15] praying and God answered
[1:03:19] back what God said to him he heard God's
[1:03:23] voice God said to him was I have
[1:03:26] glorified it and I will glorify it
[1:03:31] again simply what God
[1:03:33] Said but the people that were around
[1:03:36] there around the area they didn't hear
[1:03:41] that all they heard was some
[1:03:46] Thunder others said no no I didn't hear
[1:03:48] thunder what did you hear I heard like
[1:03:51] some blast go
[1:03:53] off mother said no I I think an angel
[1:03:57] spoke but I don't know what he
[1:04:00] said amen see everybody had their idea
[1:04:03] of what had
[1:04:04] happened but since it was only to
[1:04:08] Jesus only Jesus
[1:04:10] heard what he was really
[1:04:13] saying to others it was just a
[1:04:17] thunder noise or just something else and
[1:04:21] that's what this
[1:04:22] is the Bible calls it seven
[1:04:25] thund but what it really is is the voice
[1:04:29] of God
[1:04:31] speaking Hallelujah see amen hallelujah
[1:04:35] so
[1:04:39] notice when
[1:04:41] we understand
[1:04:43] them that it's by these seven
[1:04:47] Thunders that is what's turning our
[1:04:50] hearts back to the faith of the
[1:04:53] fathers
[1:04:55] brother Adam said so that the
[1:04:58] world can hear
[1:05:01] again directly from
[1:05:04] God he said the
[1:05:07] bride which is the believing Church in
[1:05:10] the last
[1:05:12] days after the prophet is off the
[1:05:17] scene he said the bride is to be the
[1:05:22] final
[1:05:23] voice to the final Hallelujah not my
[1:05:27] words prophet's
[1:05:31] words under her
[1:05:35] message in other words she can't say
[1:05:37] something outside that the message
[1:05:41] says when you're under something you got
[1:05:44] to be under it it's under Authority
[1:05:46] Under
[1:05:50] subjection amen amen so notice In This
[1:05:55] Very
[1:05:56] hour this great
[1:05:58] Revelation being made known to us
[1:06:02] breaking on
[1:06:04] us we are being caught up in the
[1:06:08] mystery of the seven
[1:06:11] SE which is the coming of the lord we
[1:06:15] are being taken
[1:06:17] spiritually into a perfect Face Paul
[1:06:21] said when that which is perfect is shall
[1:06:23] come
[1:06:26] that which is in part just a partial
[1:06:30] understanding CU Paul and he had he had
[1:06:34] a great a great amount of
[1:06:36] it but there were still some things that
[1:06:38] was still kind of dark them to
[1:06:42] him he said when that which is perfect
[1:06:44] is come we shall see face to face we
[1:06:48] shall know as we were known Hallelujah
[1:06:52] brother Ram said when you
[1:06:55] leave Hallelujah that old condition when
[1:06:59] you leave the things of the world said
[1:07:02] when you leave that
[1:07:03] denomination when you leave that chicken
[1:07:05] cop where they only feed you all kinds
[1:07:07] of root stuff from a day gone
[1:07:10] by he said then you have to realize that
[1:07:13] God's
[1:07:15] word amen is something to feed our souls
[1:07:20] it's Heavenly manner it's spiritual food
[1:07:23] indu
[1:07:24] season it's evil food he
[1:07:27] said hallelujah
[1:07:30] hallelujah it's a fresh kill of the hour
[1:07:34] and whatever the carus
[1:07:36] is shall
[1:07:39] G so that's what the message is doing
[1:07:41] it's Gathering amen the EOS to where the
[1:07:46] car is is and I'm trying to tell you
[1:07:48] that
[1:07:49] the amen we're not eating uh something
[1:07:52] physically
[1:07:54] it's a spiritual realm brother it's
[1:07:57] something that you go into as an
[1:08:00] experience with Christ the holy spirit
[1:08:05] amen that's what it is you come into an
[1:08:09] atmosphere you you you become a
[1:08:12] spiritual
[1:08:13] person you begin to
[1:08:16] perceive what's in the word of God
[1:08:20] Amen he be he is the
[1:08:22] teacher inside of you that begins to
[1:08:26] instruct you and to teach you and to
[1:08:30] show you what this means what that means
[1:08:33] hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:08:37] understand then you begin to get closer
[1:08:40] and
[1:08:42] closer to God he said you be Paul said
[1:08:46] you'll know as you were
[1:08:48] known hallelujah amen and when that
[1:08:50] which is perfect is come that which is
[1:08:52] in part shall be

[1:09:15] Hallelujah from a spiritual Supernatural
[1:09:20] word glory to God and that's the very
[1:09:23] where we're going to step into one of
[1:09:25] these
[1:09:27] days what am I trying to say to that
[1:09:32] church I wanted to get into into the to
[1:09:35] to the trumpet there the first four

[1:10:34] we must know that's the word of
[1:10:37] God we must
[1:10:39] realize that word is being said for a
[1:10:42] purpose because my heart needs to be
[1:10:46] turned
[1:10:47] back God wants to bring it to an
[1:10:50] atmosphere he wants to bring you to
[1:10:52] condition he's trying to show me that
[1:10:56] judgment is coming that God is a god of
[1:11:01] Grace God is a god of love but he's a
[1:11:04] god of
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:06] wrath and this demonic
[1:11:09] generation don't know
[1:11:12] God
[1:11:14] Amen but they'll know his wrath one of
[1:11:17] these
[1:11:18] days when the Judgment begin to fall
[1:11:21] down and then the Bible says
[1:11:24] that they still will repent they blashe
[1:11:27] God because of the plags that fall on
[1:11:31] them
[1:11:33] amen that's is such a
[1:11:36] condition the world has got
[1:11:39] into but this is all by mind

[1:17:21] a people who just came out of
[1:17:25] captivity in
[1:17:27] Babylon we preached on that
[1:17:30] before showed you that
[1:17:33] Malachi and Zariah and Hagi and Nehemiah
[1:17:38] and all these men the Bible speaks
[1:17:40] of were contemporary in other words they
[1:17:43] were at during the same
[1:17:46] time living when Israel had come out of
[1:17:50] Babylon in the days of Daniel God
[1:17:53] revealed to Daniel there was only two
[1:17:56] years
[1:17:57] left Amen to come out of Babylon and he
[1:18:00] was reading the the Prophecies of
[1:18:03] Jeremiah Jeremiah had already
[1:18:06] prophesied be in Babylon before they
[1:18:09] were taken and they said they'll be
[1:18:11] there 70
[1:18:13] years so Daniel begin to make some
[1:18:17] calculations amen from the prophecy that
[1:18:19] was given so when they were taken and he
[1:18:22] count and there was 68
[1:18:24] years they begin to tell the church
[1:18:27] we're about to leave it's time to go
[1:18:30] back amen remember what I told you about
[1:18:33] reading stories and finding the
[1:18:36] mystery we'll find the mystery in it 70
[1:18:39] years is seven
[1:18:42] decades which means seven Church
[1:18:44] agents and when the church agents is
[1:18:46] over to take a group of people out of
[1:18:50] captivity of mystery Babylon not natural
[1:18:53] Babylon mystery
[1:18:55] Babylon which is a denominational system
[1:18:59] which is the world going to bring us out
[1:19:01] of that
[1:19:02] spirit and bring us back to where we
[1:19:05] come from where we were taken away from
[1:19:08] which was Jerusalem from above
[1:19:11] Hallelujah they were taken to Jerusalem
[1:19:13] naturally we got to take to Heavenly
[1:19:16] places in
[1:19:18] Christ which Paul said in Galatians that
[1:19:21] Jerusalem from above
[1:19:24] Amen in the church amen which is mother
[1:19:27] of us
[1:19:28] all
[1:19:30] Hallelujah so when we come back to
[1:19:32] Jerusalem
[1:19:33] now God has brought us by this
[1:19:36] message out of out of
[1:19:39] Babylon and what happens now I'm trying
[1:19:42] to show you that this chapter right here
[1:19:45] it's not speaking of Baptist it's not
[1:19:48] speaking to Methodist it's not speaking
[1:19:51] to Pentecost
[1:19:54] it's speaking to people in this
[1:19:59] message that are no longer in
[1:20:02] Babylon the 70 years have
[1:20:05] gone we have been brought back now and
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:10] Babylonians had
[1:20:12] destroyed they
[1:20:15] had destroyed the temple amen amen when
[1:20:20] then they took him captive
[1:20:23] that's exactly what the Catholic Church
[1:20:26] did to the spiritual Temple when they
[1:20:29] took the church under that spirit and
[1:20:33] made it captive Hallelujah under a
[1:20:36] Babylonian
[1:20:38] spirit amen what did they do they
[1:20:41] destroyed the temple spiritually
[1:20:44] speaking
[1:20:46] amen Paul said I laid the
[1:20:49] foundation others are to come and build
[1:20:51] on it
[1:20:53] amen and that's what we began over there
[1:20:56] with the first
[1:20:57] church but what did Babylon do they
[1:21:00] destroyed
[1:21:02] it hallelujah hallelujah and they took
[1:21:05] the church captive so now when they come
[1:21:08] out of captivity back to Jerusalem the
