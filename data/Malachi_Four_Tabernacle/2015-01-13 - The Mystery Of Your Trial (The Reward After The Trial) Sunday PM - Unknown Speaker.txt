========================================
everything is okay yes you want to get closer always something yes yes oh yeah brother yeah that's a good sign is when we look at that then we allow the tests in our conditions no matter what David's condition was changes they said I like that one because okay I like the way he is for myself he has his chest out he has his head on us hey man it looks like he has some confidence in him he knows what he you know he adults because Satan has slaves amen he said come to me and I'll give you my yoke amen my yoke and lies he he ties you up I mean he he connects you and he connects with him let me pass through here oh yeah foreign all right but the reason why many it's because they back away from the trials and then you don't allow God to move supernaturally I believe in a supernatural God when you look at your issues Hallelujah Church age they cannot configure oh they couldn't figure out where he says I have loved Jacob he said yeah no suffering oh if God loves me Novia he he wants to put you to tennis amen so you won't be in the tribulation yeah yeah I won't suffer the tribulations Hallelujah that love meant a baby with prenatal care okay Italian his love was elected yes see say hello now listen to this elective the proof of his love amen what Greater Love do you want yeah no matter what happens his love was proven by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you the Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief on the truth that he might commitment welcome he may commit you if we're coming back to suffering amen that is his prerogative he says he is sovereign foreign Hallelujah oh what if he wouldn't have had that trial amen you see right look I guess he has a purpose if he did not have a purpose he would be the author of frustrations he would be allowing again though you go through frustration good afternoon until we live this world exactly because of the abundance of Revelations yes yes yes foreign amen man as Paul said in Ephesians 1. now and I'll do some good things here tonight but just go with me tonight we're trying to make this short amenities foreign transmission all right Logan you see it's what God is doing in you look at yourself you can speak and you can do this the statue of a person to deal with your character come on come on versus Faith but let us Faith nothing about your character you hurt you God and prayers yeah all those things is your character is too character towards others yes yes yes because it's dealing with your care okay that's why foreign started off amen right and now he's Focus es yes because it starts getting never over are not only steps but they can be stumbling blocks after the tribe to be established you see it a little bit Reflections establishes strengthens us foreign Jesus was made perfect foreign language in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected foreign Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith and work his patience is what why does he stand by the reason is Romans 8 17 and 18. if children we are Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together you see which shall be revealed in US foreign hello yeah oh that's a great place we are killed all the days oh we got to suffer but not suffer for our own cause not suffer because of our States but suffer because of the words simply is never made without suffering character corrected is a victory there's power apart from characters and since he wants us to share his throne upon the same basis a little temporary we might go through now through much tribulations foreign foreign a christ-like character foreign come on you say it seems like you go or find the trials Brothers yes that's what I'm doing

especially here in church in English how many reviews because he was complaining oh wow okay why are my children yeah the skies are bright Skies oh because everything's going good enough thank you you know what David means before the foundational World himself Hallelujah now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask but it's not the actual thoughts but what we what we are to overcome but how we are told see Jesus never overcame the personal Temptations of Satan the only by the words at each of three major trials that's corresponded to The Temptations people think something that that was done was a victory and then it ends up being a curse he has been living that word foreign foreign all right Hallelujah that's right he said Peter don't look at this right here listen something he said but in the Millennials and one of those words himself Jesus told us how to do it overcome means foreign somebody really Temptation in the soul for him right you know what the Bible says he was tempted in all approaches he was tempted by a drink he was tempted by women Jesus amen he was tempted by everything but in Alberto that could be tempted by I was tempted by everything you could put that Mark that down recognize the devil and every one of his tricks there is a real devil and he's just as real as you are a real devil and you must recognize but you must

got cancer in this kind of said that you don't believe it's your cancer okay it is people try to ignore it you can't ignore it is Devil's right here I got a face that's what the prophet's saying right here is that right now look really they should have realized that the holy spirit in you has already overcome you can overcome by him that's exactly that's what the scripture written yes was already passed through the five calories hey man he says you want to touch my goats I'll let you go inside turn the oven on seven times over here so it's seven times Hallelujah all right excellent correct everything the devil couldn't get me to disbelief it's too late produced foreign they can't stand the test of the fire residents you had to be better come before it's too late we're going to see the order of pride in the fire well let me say this tonight that's the only thing that will take you through your trials already become the fiery clouds they already come to the devil yeah he already overcome every Temptation so if you have that goal this is the same thing yeah it will take our character that is what we will take with us when we come to the world we come without nothing there's noodles but make it spiritually we will not leave oh no oh no we are going to take something with us amen amen is all we can take with us and nothing less yeah I mean we will take our characters that is what we will take with us whose character was molded by suffering is of this characterless laodice it is up to each one of us will bear his own burden amen amen every man must bear his own burden don't give you a burden that you can't bear we read it in the scriptures but you got the face and let that cries amen it'll come true foreign foreign Casey hello existence all right If This Were My Kings foreign Hallelujah he said are you the king of the Jews he was giving his life no one was taking it away the day of visitation in crossing the river maybe if you were under the line anointed I'd

God won't give you something and he knows that's why in Iranians in Paul's age because it's just like praying for the sickness I always pray for someone sick they don't have to be the minister I think it's at least signs shall follow them you pray for the sick they're here of Resurrection a temporary Resurrection he said well I didn't look at it that way rather than what it is all the same things it depends how we look at it because we can look only that at the little Divine Healing and say oh I believe I'm great okay amen but then when the big test beautiful day do you understand again the
