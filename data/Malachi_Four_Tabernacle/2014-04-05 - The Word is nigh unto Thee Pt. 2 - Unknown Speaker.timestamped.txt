[26:42] tonight and we want to leave some
[26:45] scriptures

[26:54] understand God has given us these things
[26:56] for us
[27:00] amuah the greatest
[27:02] weapon of his
[27:05] word authority and things we have by his
[27:09] word we must take it

[27:23] 12 and verse
[27:26] 26
[27:28] Satan cast out Satan his SK is divided
[27:30] against himself how shall then his
[27:33] kingdom
[27:42] stand by whom do your children cast them
[27:45] out therefore they shall be your
[27:56] judges cast out Devils by the spirit of
[27:59] God then the kingdom of God is come unto
[28:07] you or else how can one enter into a
[28:10] strong man's house and spoil his Goods
[28:13] except he first bind the strong man and
[28:15] then he will spoil his
[28:26] house
[28:28] and this this is in the same direction
[28:31] now a strong thing he's going to say
[28:33] right
[28:34] here he that is not with me is against
[28:37] me he that gather not with me scatter
[28:46] abroad what what is he talking
[28:51] about the strong man of the house is to
[28:53] be
[28:54] bound and he's Bound in the Sou when you
[28:57] run into his house you begin to take
[29:00] back the things that he stole
[29:05] amen but if you're not
[29:08] Gathering he says with
[29:13] me
[29:15] amen then you're scattering
[29:18] abroad Matthew 16 he
[29:22] say
[29:26] 19
[29:30] I will give Thee I will give unto thee
[29:33] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[29:35] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[29:37] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever th
[29:39] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[29:50] heaven amen amen now what have we been
[29:56] saying The Authority in these
[29:59] things the power that God has given
[30:02] us but we must understand we must
[30:06] understand where does that power
[30:09] lay where is the
[30:11] weapon for this Warfare of
[30:15] God it is the word
[30:19] quicked in your
[30:22] mouth amen amen that destroys the
[30:26] enemy amen amen turn with
[30:30] me
[30:36] Proverbs
[30:46] Proverbs
[30:48] Hallelujah verse
[30:52] 21se
[30:55] 1821 death and life
[30:58] are in the power of the tongue amen and
[31:02] they that love it shall eat the fruit
[31:15] thereof amen
[31:18] amen let's turn to yes Book of
[31:26] Romans
[31:31] Hallelujah
[31:36] Glory chapter
[31:52] 10 verse
[31:54] six but the righteousness
[31:58] which is a faith speaketh on this wise
[32:02] say not in thine heart who shall Ascend
[32:04] into heaven that is to bring Christ down
[32:07] from
[32:18] above for who shall descend into the
[32:20] deep that is to bring up Christ again
[32:23] from the
[32:26] dead
[32:30] notice what Paul is saying
[32:32] here this is a powerful thing because
[32:36] what he is speaking of comes from the
[32:38] ninth
[32:40] chapter into the 10th chapter where is
[32:43] saying amen that the
[32:48] Jews
[32:49] were not in the spirit of
[32:53] Faith trying to achieve the things of
[32:56] the word by the
[32:59] law he goes on to talk about
[33:03] Moses and the things of the
[33:05] law amen amen and then we find brother
[33:10] bam had an
[33:12] experience when he had the vision of the
[33:15] Seven Angels coming to
[33:18] him and the
[33:20] scripture that was open to brother
[33:22] BR was the last
[33:25] verse Roman
[33:28] 9 as it is written behold I lay inside a
[33:31] stumbling block a rockable fence who
[33:43] shall but the verses above
[33:47] that you see what Paul is speaking of
[33:52] exactly talking about faith
[33:55] righteousness by faith
[33:58] amen and righteousness by
[34:00] law do not
[34:02] work then he goes into this then he says
[34:07] here in verse 8
[34:11] 10 but he is talking about Christ
[34:14] talking about
[34:16] Christ who shall say Ascend into
[34:20] heaven amen
[34:22] amen who shall descend into the deep can
[34:29] talking about Christ who is Christ
[34:32] Christ is the word amen but what saith
[34:36] it see his answer his question he says
[34:40] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[34:46] amen and in thy heart mhm that is the
[34:50] word of faith which we
[34:55] preach
[35:04] amen amen the word is n
[35:08] the even in thy
[35:11] mouth in thy
[35:13] heartu that is the word of
[35:19] faith that if thou shall confess with
[35:22] thy mouth amen Lord Jesus Shall Believe
[35:26] In thine heart that God rais him from
[35:29] the dead Thou shalt be
[35:38] saved for with the heart man believeth
[35:42] unto
[35:43] righteousness and with the mouth
[35:44] confession is made unto
[35:51] salvation for the scripture sayth see he
[35:54] goes right back
[35:58] he he
[35:59] returns to Romans
[36:03] 933 that's his that's what he's talking
[36:06] about the
[36:08] stone amen amen The Headstone in this
[36:11] hour for the scripture
[36:14] sayth whosoever believeth on him shall
[36:17] not be
[36:23] ashamed
[36:25] amen but brother he talking about
[36:28] Revelation he's talking about the
[36:31] faith in the heart believe for
[36:35] righte and then confessing with the
[36:39] mouth the word is
[36:41] n to
[36:43] mouth and to th
[36:46] heart to speak those
[36:49] things right amen then
[36:53] brother we have to
[36:55] understand amen amen that that is where
[36:59] the word must be
[37:01] now but it must be it must come through
[37:05] that channel of the
[37:07] word brother Adam said in this
[37:10] day the same
[37:12] seed that fell in the Garden of Eden has
[37:16] come through a
[37:17] process and has come back to be the seed
[37:21] again the whole seed this is Harvest
[37:25] Time this is seed time this is back to
[37:28] the original
[37:30] life back to the Bible Mali 4 would say
[37:34] would be that
[37:36] way and in order to be this way you must
[37:39] have all the word that's the reason
[37:42] Revelations
[37:43] 10 had to take place that's why I had to
[37:48] take the trip to
[37:49] tuon to open to the
[37:52] church these things the seal amen amen
[37:58] open and then see the
[38:01] manifestation what that was the word the
[38:05] seed there's only one thing the Harvest
[38:09] is here she's dead
[38:12] right she's ready now for the
[38:15] coming oh
[38:17] brother it will be at the harest time
[38:22] that the seed will be back to its
[38:24] original condition we must have all of
[38:27] the
[38:28] word in order to be the seed you cannot
[38:32] have half of the
[38:34] seed it won't grow there's got to be all
[38:37] of the
[38:38] se you say I believe in the baptism of
[38:42] the Holy
[38:43] Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking
[38:46] in Tong that's part of the seed but now
[38:50] there's added to
[38:52] that hallelujah hallelujah there's more
[38:56] see the life not the gifts the life of
[39:00] the gifts you see what I mean we're at
[39:04] the end
[39:05] time you cannot have half a seed it's
[39:08] not to be all the seed the word has
[39:11] become flesh exactly what he promised
[39:15] Luke
[39:16] 17
[39:18] Mal all the
[39:21] Revelation all true
[39:23] life that was in the stock and back
[39:26] there
[39:28] it was gathered now in the sea ready for
[39:32] the
[39:34] resurrection ready for the Harvest the
[39:37] alpha has become
[39:38] Omega the first has become the
[39:41] last the seed that went in has come
[39:45] through a
[39:46] process and has become the seed again
[39:49] the seed that fell in the Garden of
[39:51] Eden died over there now has come back
[39:56] be the seed again the perfect
[39:59] SE the seed that fell in the Gard of
[40:02] Eden was the original SE the spoken word
[40:07] seed the
[40:09] Hallelujah was the spoken word seed
[40:13] Jesus Christ coming back having the word
[40:16] in his heart having the word in his vow
[40:19] speaking the word bringing things to
[40:23] pass that's the reason why will he GA
[40:26] began to
[40:28] manifest that first grade of weak Rich
[40:32] maturity it brought these things back to
[40:36] the remembrance of the church to have us
[40:39] to
[40:40] recognize the way that the seed will be
[40:43] manifest in this
[40:45] hour there will be no
[40:48] impersonation of the spoken word you
[40:51] cannot
[40:52] impersonate the spoken word with power
[40:56] the way it is you can
[40:59] impersonate speaking in Tong you can
[41:01] impersonate shouting and jumping you can
[41:05] impersonate preaching the gospel you can
[41:08] impersonate laying on of hands you can
[41:12] impersonate all kinds of things but you
[41:15] cannot
[41:16] imperson the spoken word yes
[41:20] sir the spoken word cannot be imp
[41:24] person the only way the spoken word is
[41:29] Manifest it is to the predestinated seat
[41:32] of
[41:33] God and that predestinated
[41:36] se has the
[41:40] word to their
[41:42] heart and to their
[41:45] mouth
[41:47] Hallelujah we have to understand that
[41:50] it's not way out there
[41:52] somewhere hallelujah huj
[41:55] it's it's
[41:57] now it's now here and here here and here
[42:03] it's mouth it's heart why because we
[42:10] have come to the
[42:12] time where the sons of God creation is
[42:17] growing the world is
[42:19] growing Heaven is crying hallelujah
[42:23] hallelujah everything is waiting for the
[42:27] manifestation the Son of
[42:30] God
[42:32] time Prophet already
[42:34] call Warriors to fight and take the
[42:37] sword of the
[42:38] word but we have to know how to
[42:42] use it's by the mouth and by the heart
[42:47] because we cannot speak something that
[42:50] is not in our soul and Jesus told the
[42:54] Pharisees you call me good
[42:56] Master but in your heart call me a devil
[43:01] you you you you hate me but in your
[43:04] heart if the heart does not
[43:08] speak with the mouth what is truly in
[43:11] there you're only condemning
[43:14] yourself amen am and the word will not
[43:18] come to
[43:19] pass it will not come to pass but from
[43:22] the treasures of our heart the mouth
[43:25] speaking
[43:27] that's why the word must
[43:30] constantly be
[43:31] closed close to our heart close to our
[43:35] mouth amen stand your feet the word says
[43:41] amen amen in the book of you don't have
[43:44] to read it but Ephesians
[43:48] 4:29 says that we are not to use our
[43:51] mouth to speak perverse things we are
[43:56] not to use our
[43:58] mouth brother said to speak things that
[44:02] does not
[44:04] profit wow we're not to use our mouth to
[44:10] speak things amen not according to his
[44:13] word we are not to use our mouth to
[44:17] speak defeat but many times because of
[44:21] what's in our heart we begin to speak
[44:24] these things we speak defeat you need to
[44:29] speak oh it's impossible oh I can't do
[44:33] this oh is this my my my faith is
[44:39] weak that's the language of the
[44:43] devil but we' got to keep the words to
[44:47] our
[44:49] heart not to our
[44:51] mouth
[44:54] always to be close it's got to be
[44:58] present it's got to be there his word
[45:02] it's got to abide in
[45:06] us and we abide in
[45:09] him
[45:10] Hallelujah the word is not in our
[45:13] mouth but
[45:15] because what comes out of our mouth is
[45:19] either
[45:22] death is in the
[45:24] tong
[45:26] for death and
[45:28] life but brother we will
[45:31] eat of the
[45:33] fruit of what comes out of
[45:38] there we will
[45:40] participate of the fruit of our mouth
[45:45] doesn't the Bible
[45:46] say we are Kings and
[45:49] Priests to offer spiritual
[45:52] sacrifice unto God by the what
[45:56] by the what fruit of our lips fruit of
[45:58] our
[46:02] lips fruit of our
[46:06] lips amen amen
[46:11] yes power of life
[46:14] and is in our
[46:17] tongue thing is brother What atmosphere
[46:20] are we
[46:23] in the thing is what's in our
[46:27] heart the thing is is the word nigh unto
[46:31] us that we can confess with our
[46:34] mouth because we believe with our
[46:38] heart there's there's the thing
[46:42] musicians
[46:43] come and when we got
[46:46] that we got the most powerful weapon
