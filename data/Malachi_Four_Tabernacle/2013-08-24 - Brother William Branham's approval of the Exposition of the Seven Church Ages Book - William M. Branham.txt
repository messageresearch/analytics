Description:
83-1     EPHESIAN.CHURCH.AGE  -  CHURCH.AGE.BOOK  CPT.3
  "Thou hast tried them that say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars."
My, that is a blunt statement. "Thou hast tried them who call themselves apostles." Isn't that presumptuous? What right has a people to try those who call themselves apostles? And how do they try them? Oh, I love this.
Here it is in Galatians 1:8,
"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have (already) preached unto you, let him be accursed."
It was the apostles who brought the original Word to the people. That original Word could not change, not even a dot or dash of it. Paul knew it was God Who had spoken to him so he said, "Even if I come and try to give a second revelation, try to make one little change in what I gave originally, let me be accursed." You see, Paul knew that first revelation was correct. God can't give a first revelation, then a second revelation. If He did, He would be changing His mind. He can give a revelation and then add to it, as He did in the Garden of Eden when He promised the Seed to the woman, and then later designated that Seed had to come through Abraham, and then later said it would come by the same blood lines in David. But it was the same revelation. It only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it.
But God's Word can't change. The Seed came exactly as revealed. Hallelujah. And see what those false apostles were doing. They came with their own word. Those Ephesians knew that Word as Paul had taught it. They were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands. They looked those false apostles in the eye and said, "You are not saying what Paul said. You are, therefore, false." Oh, that sets my heart on fire. Get back to the Word! It is not you that really tries the apostle, and prophet and teacher, IT IS THE WORD THAT TRIES THEM.
One of these days there is going to come a prophet to the Laodicean ...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
no blush walk if we draw the name of Lord Jesus Christ and this video wasn't done in spite any intention to should belittle anyone but it is an attack against Satan so this book is the entire exposition of the cemetery TV and I'm just gonna read quotes when are we to quotes and spread this in mind an adage befall at Ephesian Church age they were so in love with the message that if a man wasn't singing Paul said they would look at those false apostles and be like you're not single father therefore if your vows so how much more us who believe the message of the hour who follow the vindicated prophet brother branham right and I'm just gonna read two quotes and it's gonna blow the attacks against this book out of the water and because men and perhaps maybe women don't want to humble themselves to the Word of God that's the spirit of the age that's the spirit of the Antichrist it's to try to make try to make the word fit their doctrine and not make their doctor fit the word so we've always got to take it back to the message not take it back to what we believe what our pastor believes or what brother so-and-so believe what apostle so-and-so believes with teachers so-and-so all he knew brother drowned well he you know only the spread of administering for a long time well brother I don't care if it's not in line with what brother Branham said I'm sorry I don't want it I even have to test my own pastors revelation I gotta test my own revelation I gotta test my brother's revelation you know the pillar of fire overs that take photos and say oh I see I'm vindicated my brother if that light is not bearing a record to what this word says I'm sorry to differently as Paul says of an angel comes and preach another gospel then be cursed if anyone tries to bring anything outside of the message to be out here occurs rather random preach the pub preach but so in your clothes okay this is annoying ones Afghan time annoying the ones at the end time right so you can have all the emotion you can have all the anointing but what counts the most in this mess that she's telling them that's the word a worried the word the word this is our quote 1965 I know anyone's at the end time notice let me give you a little example look at those people who come under Moses prophecy come out of that organization and come out of everything under the prophecy saw the great works and wonders and things like that and come up to the borderline of going in now we pay attention is where the sisters now leave their it comes your name on the book see you've got it fixed down you've got to fix that okay you've got it free stuff and you that's not here and out in the on the up order the question about your name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life see it's puzzled a lot of Ministers but wait till you get the book so the way to get the book you'll understand it if you just got any lighting see so it's where the rent so if you got any lighting you you'll understand this book if not I guess you're in darkness I you know Donny that's brother branham's words it's harsh but the truth where the random says you can't feature the bright hard enough you can't so we got to make our revelation Fitness word not the word for us we're not trying to dress the word we're not dressing ourselves with ourselves or dressing ourselves with the word is where the word born bride right brother branham system this is powerful notice now you'll turn your head and won't even look at it if you don't want to see it he's telling you read this book I don't want to see it like my mother used to say you can't get blood from a turnip because there's no blood in it Wow now what's what's the blood it's the life of the Lamb Leviticus the life is in the blood so you can't Josh sorry oh I'm not sorry it's the word my last quote I try to do god is service without it being God's will sorry always it's right at the end of the church age we ve got the thing so the ecclesiastic still messed up until God sends a messenger which was our prophet brother branham revelation 7 Malachi 4 luke 1730 okay and that's the message to that church then they take his message because he just gives a little while because he lives he just lives a little while and God then they take his message instead of carrying on with it with the rest of it carry on carrying it on with the rest of it they make a denomination you got to believe our belief I believe our doctrine my pastor stance my evangelist saw himself says brother so in those days I don't care what so in some sense this book is saying or what the message is saying okay and they make a denomination they make a denomination and then they come make another denomination another messenger take another one now when you take away the authenticity of this of this book and you take away its authenticity of this book your without even knowing you're making yourself the messengers engage his brother branham often just he he gave his approval on this book died years approval and what I'm about to read blows any doctrine any idea I didn't forget it awhile I'm sorry I got I got disabled or here my brother ran who said what I got what's the secret the word is in the bride she has the mind of Christ and she knows what to do with the word because we're anointed with the eagle anointing we can see the two spirits working in the church how the devil's against this book because it exposes them that's why it's called the exposition of the church ages it's exposing same from the church changes this is the consummation and the seven churches and the seals nor do you see the white horse rider being Christ here or rather random said that in the act and and when you preach there at church changes in the 60s and early sixties before the seals it talks about two Antichrist here not not the white was being writer being pressed okay you all seen in my book it'll be drawn out in the seven churches which he told me was he done that's capital H he told him Jesus Christ which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of judgment for you so the really Rams gonna be judged for this book it come from God not for my thinking hey that's it's my brother vales book I'm sorry brother the L will tell you he's probably never thinking like all brother Ram who's standing my brother branham announcing well better rarely think it's my book I just grandma ties it brother branham's likely but the Bragg will catch it I feel like speaking in tongues right now oh man not from I think he noticed you I thought I thought different from it if I was going to have my own thought my brother Jack told me about the angel there that that Christ was a glorified body but it wasn't it was showing that the message of being right the supreme being it was God see just the very thing I had been preaching from the word the word always bears record of the word hey let me read that again come from God not from Elkington it's that's a floor you gotta take the prophets word you need to take a man's word and like the Bible says to be carnally minded is that but to be spiritually minded it's liberating its life and I don't want to be carnal mind it that's what man-made interpretations ours to be karma Lena I want to be spiritually minded why is God as a providing place that's in Christ by the church by the pastor and it's in his word
