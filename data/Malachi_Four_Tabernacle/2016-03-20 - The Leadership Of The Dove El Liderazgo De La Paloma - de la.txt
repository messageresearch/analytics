amen we're going to be reading from the nth verse we want to be speaking tonight on the leadership of the dove we believe that God has brought us victory in this hour complete and full Redemption amen amen that was his promise and he has fulfilled that we have to accept it by faith and allow that Dove of the Holy Spirit lead us into full Victory vict full Victory Victor amen hallelujah we read in St Mark chapter 1 verse 9 you all have it tonight and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John in Jordan and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased remember the other day we were speaking about Enoch's testimony amen amen last Sunday morning and how that his testimony brother bam said is what he confess he says and and one of the reasons while why God was pleased with Enoch he had a testimony before he left that he pleased God in Hebrews says without faith it is impossible to please God Enoch had faith brother bam said it was his confession that pleased God Amen that was his testimony his confession amen amen and brother B said he his his confession was that he was going in the Rapture Hallelujah that that he was to leave one of these days there's power in confession when it comes from the heart when it comes by Revelation what you receive in Your Heart by Revelation that you confess amen there's power in that so here we see that the dove comes upon him and the voice says this is my beloved Son I am well pleased brother Braham said this is when man and God become one is that right amen the church in its condition brother said this was the day when God and man become one amen amen verse 12 and immediately the spirit that same Dove that came on him amen driveth him into the Wilderness and he was there in the wilderness 40 days tempted of Satan listen to this and was with the wild beast and the angels ministered unto him amen he was with the wild beast powers in in the journey in the wilderness amen hallelujah are we the sons of God in this hour being led through through a Wilderness amen hallelujah hallelujah let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we pray Lord that your word father would have it the effect Lord we we move away all reasoning all human reasoning that that that is Lord abomination in your s Lord is something that father you you condemn and your Prophet told us after we you have sent your word after you've sent your son after that you sent the gospel and signs and wonders and then the last sign you sent us to the Gentile World Lord revealing yourself through a prophet it's it's a sin to disbelieve and your and your Prophet said oh god there would be nothing left for us to be condemned at the end but L God we we curse Lord all unbelief we come against Lord all reasoning father father may this great Dove of faith the fire of the Holy Ghost the great Pillar of Fire lead us oh God into a greater Faith by your word that has been revealed by the message of the hour oh God we pray in this hour father may you shake our minds Shake our beings oh God that we might walk in the light father that you have provided for us may we hear the voice say shalom shom Rise and Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee we pray in this hour father that we l God might as children of the light as children Lord of this evening life Lord take a hold of the word and walk in it by faith may we reverence it as we heard this morning may we humble ourselves to it Lord God and Father may we lord enter into action by the prophetic anointing that has comeing this hour for a prophetic people that is able to receive these things we pray oh God leaving Lord your children your people in your hands father that you might take control of me of The Interpreter of the hearer of the word and father in the name of Jesus Christ May the victory that you have already given us in this hour be made manifest in our very lives in our being in our Tabernacle in our temple in our mind in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but when we come brother the scripture says that he has not given us weapons that are carnal amen but he has given us weap weapons that are powerful they're Mighty in God to the pulling down of strong to cast down imagination to cast down reasoning amen that's why when we come to the house of the Lord we must come amen with that faith in our hearts worshiping God that has saved us from our sins has pardoned Us by his blood he has washed Us by his grace and his word he has filled us amen with the Holy Ghost we come with Thanksgiving we come with expectation we come with faith we come expecting Victory we come expecting healing we come expecting deliverance we come expecting that the problem s that we have will be fulfilled by the word going forth and healing the need that we have how many believe that tonight how many know that that's true and that's real that is not some fictitious thing that's the promise of the word that's the reality of the message of the hour God hates religion he took it off of Adam in the beginning he cursed the Pharisees amen God hates religion he hates the fact that a person might look at God and try to put God as a religion try to put the message as a religion to just come to church and just do our duty and just be there brother bam said the reason people are dying in the pews where they're sitting it's because they don't want to take the prescription amen why is the daughter of my people how why is she not recovered there is bomb in Gilead is there no physician there with the with the with the uh with the doses correct doses for the infirmity that is needed for the prescription has been given to us in this hour but brother bam said you can die on the very doorstep of the doctor that has the medicine for your cure it's no good just to get to the doorstep of the doctor or just to go into his office and sit there you've got to take the prescription that he gives you and it's the same thing when we come here it's not enough just to come through those doors and sit down and and sing a little song and hear the word a little bit not enough you got to take the prescription amen hallelujah and I believe that the prescription for this hour for this day for this time is the message of the hour hallelujah amen amen that's the prescription amen hallelujah what do I need brother let me look at the prescription let me see what it says amen I have these symptoms oh I feel like this let me look at the prescription what it say here the prescription says amen you need this is that right amen amen amen that's what it is it's the truth am hallelujah hallelujah we believe that the dove has come down in this day also is that right amen and the dove come upon the prophet in this day amen and begin to lead him to many things amen as the first grain of wheat he was leading him to that faith for this hour amen amen hallelujah brother sister let's look at this for a little bit the dove descended Upon Jesus amen amen God and man become one it was a uniting time how many know that brother bam said in the Easter seal that Jesus had to go to the Jordan he had to go to the Jordan amen amen to receive the Holy Ghost amen Oh my he had to go to Jordan to receive the Holy Ghost we have to understand something and this is what we got to understand when we look at the life of Jesus Christ he is not only showing us or revealing to us God right but he is also showing us the way that God the way that God redeemed him he was to redeem the rest of the sons he's also showing us that the way he was born the rest of the sons must be born the same way he is showing us that the way he was a son we are to be Sons also the way that he pleased the father he is our example to show us how to please the father you understand he is showing us amen and this the same thing when we look at that same same Ministry in our day we got to understand that we got to understand that the way God dealt with the prophet of God he he he was setting an example for the rest of the seed in this age because he is the first grain to go through that process and come to maturity and come to the fullness of the stature of Christ and then from there amen be taken off the seene because there's no need for him to be here until the rest of the seed come up to the same place he has reached the limit as as Abraham's seed it's full Redemption it's Perfection it's it's adulthood amen amen and when we look at that it's the same thing amen what God did to brother brandham he is showing us he not only come to reveal to us who God was how Jesus was but he's also showing us through his life how God was going to deal with his seed in this age amen amen how amen he was GNA we were going to come under that prophetic anointing how he was how he was going to be dealt be led through the word how he would see one thing but then the Lord would open the word and show him the fullness of the Revelation how all of those things that he went through were there for our example he let his life he let his life go through certain areas he let his life amen amen to certain places amen made them pass through certain things and then show us how God's power how God's leadership during those times brought him out amen With Victory showed him a lesson and brother randam was one to come and tell us what he went through his experience and how God was dealing with him was training him was bringing him Amen to that place how many understand that to show us how to be a faithful servant to show us how to be a son in this age to show us how to please the father in this age amen amen don't just look at him as one that come to reveal to us God but look at him also as one that come to show us how to walk as Sons as Daughters of God and be led of the spirit in this age do you believe that Romans 8 says in chapter 8 verse 14 we know the scripture for as many are as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so Jesus in the scripture that we read said was led of the spirit amen amen to the Wilderness what did we read all that are led by the spirit these are the sons of God so he is showing us this is the point I'm trying to make that he is showing us how he was led as a son amen amen because we as Sons must be led to do you believe that that same do that led Christ Into the Wilderness was lead leading the prophet in this day amen he says it himself so when I read the scripture verse 14 what I read is that the Eagles are led by the dove amen all those that are eagles shall be led by the Hallelujah is that right when we go to St John 16 verse 13 St John 16 let's read the scripture St John 16 verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you amen into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so the spirit of Truth is the dove Allelujah is the guide amen that's always been the dove it's always been the guy it's always been the pillar of fire in every age in the first Exodus it was the dove leading Moses the eagle amen amen amen in the days of Noah it was the dove leading the ego Noah into a new world Hallelujah and brought back the evidence of the new world Amen it's always been the dog but we are promised in this hour the spirit of Truth how many understand that we got to understand that the spirit of Truth was promised for this days in the message a guy brother bam said there was many things that were left undone there was a lot of confusion on marriage and divorce there was a lot of confusion on on on uhhh the Trinity there was there a lot of confusion on many things of the scripture amen amen but he said that is the reason that God had to open the seals to loose the spirit of Truth amen there is a loosing of the holy spirit in this last day and that loosing of the Holy Spirit is the message the revelation of the word loing the same anointing that led the prophet to the people amen so that the people not be bound by denominational rivers rivers amen amen not be bound by denominational Rivers you see you cannot no denomination can actually bind the Holy Spirit impossible but you got to understand how the prophet for what he is saying in Feast of the trumpets he said the Holy Spirit has been bound for 2,000 years almost 2,000 years at the door of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church but then he says but now the clouds have fade away the sun has risen again the same light that shine in the East with Jesus Christ has shined again in the west it shall be light in the even even he says and now the same light the same gospel the same Ministry has come back he says and that brings a loose of the holy spirit so that it can work and lead the Church of God Amen that's what this message has come to do it come to anoint us with that Dove to to lead us amen with that do because he is the ego of the age and that do L him amen but brother and sister where are the eaglets where are those Eagles amen that wait upon the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that mount up their wings as Eagles glory to God they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not be faint glory to God amen amen because we're coming to that hour how many believe it but in order in order to get to this in order for the prophet in this age reach the place that he reached the dove led him through many trials Temptations Beast wild beast amen amen but the whole time the dove is leading as long as I see that Dove hallelujah hallelujah I don't care where I'm at though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death hey amen I shall fear no evil glory to God wild beast what is a beast it's a power hallelujah amen brother Bram typ the Wilderness as the very World in which we live in the natural world is controlled by political powersonic Powers religious Powers those are wild beasts amen amen the Scarlet colored Beast escar Revelation 173 and 8 this is the powers that those who are LED of the dove must confront Hallelujah in this in this Wilderness the Wilderness represents the world in the condition that it's in in the wilderness that Jesus was in the ones who Rule and control that Wilderness the ones who are in control of the Wilder are these wild beasts Hallelujah is that right who who controls out there in the middle of nowhere in the wilderness in those jungles in those places where there's no civilization who's the king who's who's the ones that are in control the wild beast amen they're the ones that are ruling they're the ones that are controlling these are all types because Revelations n we see two million demons amen beasts besas amen amen wild beast but in Revelations 10 the Angels ministered unto him you understand Hallelujah do you understand did Angels minister to the prophet Hallelujah yes sir amen they ministered to the prophet but watch brother the do LED brother BR and he led him through the Wilderness and in that Wilderness he came in encounter with these Wild he was tempted of the devil brother Bram take this place brother brandham take this power brother brandham become head of this organization brother bam said with my Ministry I could have well been a billionaire temped of the devil the same way Jesus was in this Wilderness Journey the dove kept leading him the angel kept ministering to him glory to God hallelujah amen amen in Revelations n wild beasts come out teeth like Lion amen amen see s like scorpion all of these things are in the wilderness all of these things are in the wilderness of Temptation scorpions snakes dragons Lions you understand Hallelujah and he confronted these things but in Revelations 10 God the Angels seven angels come and minister to him open up the seals and there he saw amen it's the Antichrist there he saw amen the spirit of political power of religious power and of demonic power in control of this system and then he said no wonder I've been against denomination all of my life and now I know why it's the very mark of the beast amen amen but he overcome Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus overcome brother Bram said the only way you can overcome is recognize that he already overcome and he's leaving in you and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the wilderness hallelujah hallelujah greater is the dove than the wild beast Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord of God GL we must real realize brother that those same angels are here still here to minister unto those who shall be of Salvation that's the Bible Hebrews 1:14 ministering Spirits sent forth to minister to those who shall be hallelujah hallelujah and in this hour brother those angels are here to minister to you in this Wilderness are you facing Temptation are you facing trials in your life amen you don't know what what it is but I'm here to tell you tonight it's the dove don't worry he's leading he said but I don't understand why is he leading me to the Wilderness why is he leading me to where the wild beast are because that's where he led Jesus that's where he led the prophet that's where he Lead You In This Hallelujah but he has promised us I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world amen amen you're facing Temptations I'm facing Temptations you're facing trials I'm facing trials we're in the wilderness brother but we got to recognize that God is leading us yes amen amen because in Revelations 10 the mighty Angel come down and put one foot on the land and one on the sea is that right how many remember that in Revelations 13 there was a beast that come out of the Earth in Revelation 17 there was a Beast come out of the water and when this Mighty angel Christ the angel of the Covenant come down he put one foot on the Beast that comes out of the earth one foot on the Beast that comes out of the water that's Dominion that's power Hallelujah because he will bruise the serpent head amen amen but this serpent turned out to had a a few heads oh my amen oh my it turned out to have a few heads so he has to step this one over here this head and step this head and when when he does that that's it brother it's full Dominion it's full control and then Christ comes down and says I have come down to do this to claim what I died for to claim what I paid the price for come out of her my [Applause] people and he gives that book and says seventh angel here you go you're my voice House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and those great Powers those iron bars begin to break amen it's the time of Deliverance it's the time of Freedom Satan has no more power upon the Bride of Jesus Christ what are you afraid of brother no no doubt in the natural if you would be walking through a Wilderness like Jesus not just for one day not just for two days walking through the Wilderness amen fasting walking through the Wilderness walking and walking amen amen and you see all of a sudden there comes a wild beast Hallelujah there Jesus is walking he says Lord you are leading me that John he saw that Dove come up me and now you're leading me I don't know what this is Lord but look at that Beast is coming to attack me amen there had to be something protecting him naturally speaking amen you understand and then the supernatural support would come down Angels would Minister to him strengthen him raise up his faith and says amen I got a few more days left amen I'll keep going hallelujah hallelujah I'm keep I'm still pressing I still believe that the dove is still leading me amen there's no one to witness it there's no one to tell me it's okay Jesus God is leading you no I'm by myself in this trial in this temptation no one knows what's going in my mind I'm looking at those stones and I'm imagining some warm bread I'm looking at this at this great uh uh uh Temple and I want to jump off no one knows my battles no one knows what I'm going through but the angels are ministering to me glory to God amen amen glory hallelujah how many believe that amen that's right Amen brother sister when we look at this we must understand the spirit of Truth was to lead us to guide us into all truth brother sister no matter what thing you're facing in this you have to understand understand if you have done what God requires like we heard this morning if you have confessed if you have put it under the blood amen amen things in your life that he has come to attack you to bring in your mind this fear this doubt these things to try to bring you to a weakness and in that weakness once he sees that he says now I got it now I've got him now I know where to hit him and be sure that that's where he's going to hit you but brother Ram said God wants to take our weaknesses and he wants to use that to overcome the enemy amen are you hearing me hallelujah amen brother and sister how many believe that the dove is leading us since the beginning where this where the Bible says in Genesis 1 the spirit of God moved upon the waters how many know that that very word in in the original means the spirit of God fluttered over the waters and I confirmed it with a message every time brother Bram talks about that brother Bram says God had planted the seeds in the Earth but it was without form and void it was it was just a chaos amen amen power of transformation remember chaos Darkness like this age he said but then the spirit of God he says like a dove begin to come over the waters he said it begin to call forth what he had planted he had to create this atmosphere so that the seed that he had planted the word had to come forth and brother that's what we got to realize that that dog fluttering over the seed in this hour will bring you to your manifestation to the manifestation of the sons of God that's why he said in Isaiah 60 the glory glor amen amen of the Lord the glory GL of the new new and Unseen World is shining Upon Us brother Bram said from Mortal to immortality amen amen such that are dead by the amen amen they are quickened amen amen there's quickening power you believe that dove was with Abraham L Abraham out of of the calans and that D was leading him to the land amen and kept leading him and when he met MDC hallelujah hallelujah it was the dove that led him when he met Elohim them human flesh it was the dove that led him when he went to mount to sacrifice his son it was the do that led him yes sir is that right how many know that the dove amen was leading no is that right the dove LED John and revealed to the E the dove revealed himself to the eag to declare the word for that hour to Noah in the ark amen the prophet the eego he led him into a new world by the dove he was sent through the window and came back through the window with the evidence of the new world Hallelujah and when he came on the day of Pentecost he came in through the window and brother Bram said I have seen but now I heard he said Junior jackon had the dream that I was preaching from this pulpit and the congregation and he said and I looked into the lattice amen amen and the glory of God the pillar of fire come through what through the window and and Junior Jackson said brother bam you stood there you pointed he said the people begin to cry the people begin to fall on their face and he said that's Jehovah that's Jehovah God that's the that come through the window for Noah come through the window for 100 it come through the window in this hour that's a same do brother but we want to say we want to bring you to something tonight I trust it would be a blessing watch this we know that also in this time when brother Bram was born in a l cabin just like the ark was made out of logs the light of the pillar of fire also come through the wind am Hallelujah is that right through the window and it sat over the little baby hallelujah hallelujah why does it come through the window because brother Brown says in the message the comforter he says Noah in the ark on the third story was the only place where there was a window he says and the light was shining through the window the light of the new world they never seen it had all been destroyed and he was going to come out to a new day an eternal day under the rainbow Covenant hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram called it a token amen amen but brother baham tells us that the ark landed on the seventh Mountain the third pool the light brother in order for us to begin to look into that we must come to that same seventh Mountain we must come under the third pool and that light begin to shine into our hearts light from our from an eternal world the dove of the seventh Mountain you believe that brother amen when we look at brother branham's life as I said earlier he was showing us Plan of Redemption how many know that every seven years brother branham's life was always uh strucken stricken by by something that he tells us was a sickness amen amen and that sickness would torment him brother bam said he would come un under tremendous mental oppression mental oppression amen amen amen amen it was not only a stomach issue it was something that would come to torment him amen hallelujah it was something that would bring him under a condition brother bam said that I couldn't even go preach I couldn't go overseas I couldn't go nowhere amen amen every every seven years this sickness would strike him but he said there was seven eights Amen in his life seven eight he was 56 years old amen amen seven eight so in the eighth cycle of his life the eighth speaking of the Eternal day he was healed amen amen after the 6,000 years of man suffering because of sin here God brought a man across the chasm back to Perfection the statue of a perfect man our enemy is dead brother watch what brother bam says here first he tells us how it was a weasel that he saw in the vision flew into his mouth and began to tear up his inside but he heard a voice way down in the room but he begin to scream in the vision he tearing me to pieces with my hands up looking I went to screaming oh God have mercy it's killing me I Heard a Voice way down in the room say remember it's only six Ines long how many remember that story I've told it to you many times the people around the Tabernacle they know it well On and On It win suffering just the same the male Brothers examined me and they said your father was an Irishman he drank your mother being a half Indian makes you almost a half breed you're just a nervous wreck until you'll never be out of it said otherwise you're healthy but that's something in the soul that man cannot control when a man dies you can't hold an autopsy because his Soul's gone he said well you'll never get over it that's what the doctor said and that guy said my old doctor said my father had it he died about 85 90 years old and he said a month or two before he died I examined him had it all his life and he' get he said them spell they get it some get it they're high tempered that's the kind that can kill you the other kind like women is menopause they cry you got the kind that's kind of a weary feeling amen amen weary amen amen the oldtimers Used To Call It The Blues amen amen it wouldn't leave them when that hits you your stomach sours you're just upset I said but I don't do nothing I said I'm happy that's right that's just out of the human grab bag you you always have it he said oh what a discouraging thing but the words to think remember it's only six Ines long that hung with me as my dear wife back there tell you I thought of that then mama had a dream of these doves Hallelujah says you were building a house upon a hill and said I seen six white doves come down from heaven coing in a letter S and they set upon your chest and you was looking at the one in front that was trying to tell you something real glossy white doves they took their little heads put it against your cheek and begin to coup I couldn't understand it I said and I seen you praise the Lord and I said they formed the letter s they went back into the skies going back home that little animal that I saw was only six inches long the string of doves that my mom saw was six six is incomplete I knew that someday I'd see the seventh one see six that was man suffering brother bam immediately connects it to man's suffering amen amen and six brothers 6,000 years of man's suffering because of sin because of the curse of sin amenu and then he tells us of the vision and how that morning he went up to the Catalina Mountain way up to the place where the angel of the Lord put the sword in his hand and real early he started climbing up the mountain he says and I turned to my right something told me turn to your right and I went into the Peaks I was going around those great huge rocks many times bigger than this Tabernacle laying up there where seldom ever a person can get to and along about 11 o' I was into a little Cove and I took off my shirt my hat in my hand because I was just lathering with sweat and I turned in there and as I turned into that little cold I felt the presence of the Lord I ched off my hat looked around I said he's somewhere I said what is it a few more steps said Lord you're here somewhere I look laying on my path and there laid that that that thing that little squirrel that weasel amen it just jumped at something and missed it and it hit in a bunch of choya that's jumped in Cactus but those things grow like trees those things grow like trees now and then it says it ran through its head chest stomach he was dead that odd looking squirrel that weasel looking type thing he had missed my mouth and he hit that Cho and the voice of the Lord said your enemy is dead I took off my hat I stood there and I trembled hallelujah hallelujah oh my I said how could this thing be up here for so many days because some days after I killed a snake hallelujah amen glory I killed the snake the most dangerous snake we got the coral snake amen laying right beside of me a few few days after that and when I started to come back to show it the crows had already eaten the snake see had been laying there ever since I seen the vision two days before so there it was laying dead and I and I mashed it through with my foot GL to Goden and I went back sat down again sat there and cried a while and I prayed and I could look down over over two songs miles below me turning back and coming back still late there when I entered into that Cove the spirit of God come over me again and the next day something told me go back to the mountain he went up to the mountain standing there in front of me set that seventh little white dog looking right at me and I rubbed my eyes I said surely it's a vision and I said I looked and I said little dog where did you come from just as pretty and white could have been a pigeon whatever it was but way in out in the wilderness in in the wilderness a little white dove oh God Almighty who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead who servant I am his word laying here open before him know that I tell the truth I lie not there sit the dog sitting looking right at me I walked around and I said this is a vision then them little white wings as snowy as it could be yellow feet yellow beak sitting there looking at me he was watching straight Westward I walked around him like that wouldn't touch him for nothing I walked back up the trail looked back he was still watching me brother as a son of Abraham I consider

wings of the word amen remember God is not a respector of person person he could send a message to Noah he could send it to John the Baptist could send it to me and he could send it to others amen I pray that the dove will fly into every heart right now Lord this little golden beak that Whispers by his stripes un heal grant that transgressions will be blotted out our iniquities will be forgiven our sicknesses will be healed it's in your hands father in Jesus Christ's name he says where did that Dove come from out there in the wilderness I say this God seen Abraham needed a RAM for a sign he's Jehovah Gyra and he provided a ram the same thing for us in this hour he has provided for you on the wings of a dove the dove the spirit of the Holy Ghost to give you faith in your heart to believe that you're going to be healed oh brother in this hour that same D is still Whispering amen the secret into the ears of the bride of Christ that same do is still leading her in the shower amen go through trials amen some through the waters some through the some through deep Waters amen amen but all through the blood God that is why we got to realize in the show that this Dove brother sister is what's gonna lead us all the way all the way how many believe that how many believe that that same do L Jesus Into the Wilderness led the prophet Into the Wilderness to show them this this thing right here is dead it's over with it's overcome by the power of the blood amen amen that enemy amen of his life that enemy in his flesh that enemy in his in his mind that would torment him and bring him to weariness and pull him down that enemy's dead glory to God because the enemy scheme has been de declared amen amen the son of man man has power Amen to bind the dragon in this hour yes sir Matthew chapter 12 that's exactly what Jesus said amen the son of man had come to bring the kingdom of God but he had to bind the serpent he had to bind the dragon so that the sons of God could take faith in this hour to realize we got an inheritance and the enemy is constantly bringing condemnation in our minds in our flesh with sicknesses with trials with Temptations with troubles amen amen hallelujah that thing brother has got to die Jesus Christ pay the Supreme sacrifice for your healing for your deliverance to fill you with the Holy Ghost to lead you to total Deliverance all that was in the life of the Prophet was to show you that he was the first grain of weak what God did in his life by the do that CH he prayed Let It Come Into the Heart of the people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah after the son of man Ministry left off the sea 2000 years ago that same do LED Peter to Cornelius same let sa on the road to Damascus that same continue to lead the church and in this hour that God is still leading the Bride of Jesus Christ to a faith that she has never known before but we look at the Wilderness we look at the weo we look at the wild beasts we look at these Temptations we look at all these things and then the enemy condemns us hallelujah what is it brothers and sisters we all know what our trials are what our Temptations are amen we all know what our Cycles are but the dev is trying to lead us tonight to something greater to let us know amen your enemy has been dealt with already he's dead it's only six inches it was only for 6,000 years but that has come to an end we have come into a new day the church ages are over amen and Christ has appeared Amen in this hour where was Jesus crucified he was crucified outside of Jerusalem up on a mountain called gotha and he could look down to Jerusalem amen amen up there in Sabino Canyon the enemy was upon a tree and the voice said the enemy is dead he says I could look back and see Tu son down there Jerusalem amen we realize in this hour that you must have your experience on Calvary you must meet him in Calvary Amen in this hour that you can to look back to Jerusalem that you twoo can look at your enemy dead in this hour yes sir how many believe itj you believe that we're in a new Ephesians that when Joshua led the people into the new land amen he told them every place that the SES of your feet shall tread upon the same is your possession how many believe that tonight brother bam said I I stepped on that snake in Sabino Canyon in that Wilderness he saw the dead enemy there it was all a type showing us in this hour what God had come to do for the systems of religion he put his foot over it for the systems of the world he put his foot over it for the systems of the carinal nature in man amen for sicknesses and death he put his foot over it amen amen and in this hour brother when we realize that these things have been done and how much faith we we have lacked to believe God's promise we hear the word we hear this revelation we hear these things but it does not have an effect in us to the to the point that we can act upon the word profess the word amen and bring all enemies under our feet because Footprints are possession in this hour you got to claim your promise and when they went in the Bible says in Joshua 8 amen that Joshua after that there was sin in the camp he told the Army to hold up that something was going wrong God promised us certain Victory amen not one of the armies of Israel was going to was going to die in battle but when Joshua begin to see that taking place said there's something wrong in the church there's there's a golden W somewhere brother Bram said an adoption message if people come up here to be prayed for and they're not healed and you're in sin it's your fault that that person not healed and that responsibility is on you that's the word of the Lord brought to us through a prophet so when we come brother we must come the way of faith not with sin in our life not with anything in our mind amen we must come ready under the leadership of the do because that same Dove is leading you it's leading me it's all leading us to something brother and that something is the same something that the prophet was led to amen amen because that D brother Adam said LED Jesus Through the Wilderness and when he finished leading him through the Wilderness he brought him to the synagogue amen and he opened the book and he said this day this scripture fulf hallelujah hallelujah it was the same do that leads you to trials will lead you to the revelation of the word it will lead you to all truth that same dog led him all his life all the way to the cross of Calvary amen and that same dog that came down in the river Ohio amen led the prophet of God all the way and all his life until Sabino Canyon to show him your enemy is dead Jesus Christ already paid the price amen and this is just a representation of what he already did amen amen that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah but when we realize then the king of that of that City begin to win over the armies of Israel in the promised land but once Joshua took care of the sin amen they had to Stone the family not just the one that did the sin the whole family had to die children mother and father were all under the penalty of the death by Stone amen amen and once that sin was out of the camp then Joshua said let's continue to March now Glory the king of AI amen amen and when the king of of AI saw that the armies of Israel had gained forces coming against him brother the Bible says that Joshua won the victory over the king AI but you know what Joshua did he took the King dead and he hung him on a tree Hallelujah and on that tree he hung till evening Hallelujah Hallelujah to show Israel your enemy is dead Hallelujah glory to God the same thing the [Applause] Kingus did for Esther amen amen the same thing King aerus did for Esther amen amen amen amen amen the one that wanted to kill her people kill her by political power by religious power amen and by demonic power these wild beasts anointing the system amen through Amen to come and bring a persecution to bring a slaughtering annihilation of a a genocide of this people amen amen but Esther said even if this means my death to come before the king without being summoned for this reason hallelujah hallelujah I have come to the palace for this reason I have been made wife of the king for this very reason to stand in the gap and reflect Christ in my life amen glory to God and when the king put out his scepter and and and she asked her petition later on she expressed to him who the enemy was amen you what the king did he said get hmon and hang them upon that tree that he wanted to hang Mor hallelujah hallelujah kill him and hang him on that tree glory to God to show the people to show es to show the bride your enemy is dead Hallelujah that's the king's message in this hour brother how many believe it this is the day that we're living in but brother let's let's look at something here as we close how many know that the scripture shows us these these tremendous uh symbols these types that we cannot we cannot missen if we look at the at at them carefully we can understand exactly what it is what it's showing us amen amen why do I say this because let's let's look at something it was after the six dogs the six inches amen man suffering that this seventh Dove appeared is that correct it was after the six always always after the six that the seventh Dove appears amen amen after the six the seventh appears yes sir let let's go to the Bible in Revelations chapter 6 let's read how that after the Sixth Seal amen The Sixth Seal is from verse 12 to verse 17 correct chapter six of the Book of Revelation verses 12 to 16 or 17 all of that there is the Sixth Seal can you say amen amen are you looking at it right there in your Bible I'm not going to read it I'm showing you from verse 12 to verse 17 is the six seal amen amen after the Sixth Seal chapter seven opens up with this see verse two and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the Earth in the sea brother bam said that's the sealing Angel that's Christ that's the angel of the Covenant amen that's the D after the six se are you understanding after six you see the seventh oneu that's the seventh Dove amen amen who's the dove it's the angel of the Covenant it's Christ it's the promise of the spirit for this day let's look at Revelation n look at the sixth trumpet after the six the sixth trumpet is from verse 13 of chapter n to chap to verse 21 is that the sixth trumpet is that six six Ines 6,000 years amen amen and after the six what appears in verse one of chapter 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud rainbow upon his head face as it were the sun feet as pillars of fire that's the seventh do that's the same Angel Revelation 72 it's the seventh do after the six always always after the six amen amen is the seventh one the seventh dog hallelujah hallelujah let's go to the seventh vile or the sixth V Revelation chapter 16 Revelation chapter 16 amen amen verse 12 the sixth vile see after the six what what happens the spirits unclean like frogs but what does verse 15 say behold I come hallelujah hallelujah as a thief amen that's the seventh do after the seventh after the sixth amen amen always the seventh Dove after the Sixth Seal after the six trumpet after the six V it's only six amen amen but then comes the conclusion then comes the seventh one amen and it's God himself Hallelujah that little Dove is nothing else but God himself amen God himself in morphe in the form of a dove he can turn into a rainbow turn into a dove John saw as a dove amen and in this hour he has come as the seventh do is that right the seventh do is to lead us into rapturing Faith a faith that we've never known before a faith in a world of Faith like Noah into a world that he never knew before the let him brother Bram said when when you live in a world isolated to yourself amen amen glory to God GL now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now hallelujah hallelujah it's a new world it's a world of faith brother said you've got the power in you to speak and create a world and live in it brother and sister it's about time we start creating our own world in our home in our car wherever we are let's create our world of perfect Faith a world that the beasts have no power over because we're being ministered By Angels glory to God we are creators we are seeds of Abraham we don't got to listen to what the psychiatric says to what the doctor says to what these systems of man say Amen it's God's word over all things amen but we got to believe it and in this in this new Ephesians Joshua tell the people look at these Kings amen they HIIT in the dens they said now King AI is dead he hung on a tree and Joshua said let's go after the rest of the Kings and the Bible says that they ran and they hid in the caves amen but Joshua brought them out of the caves and brought them before the people and laid them on the floor and he told Israel Come Ye solders and put your foot on the neck of these King Hallelujah come on children of Israel come on Seed of Abraham put your feet on the neck of these Kings hallelujah hallelujah these Kings of there were five Kings five SES of

Sabino Canyon and then the voice said your enem is dead don't you realize that we can put all things under our feet amen amen sickness under your feet feet Temptation under your feet amen what is it yes that's bothering us what is it that that that's messing with our minds making us weak so that we don't we don't have that Faith to overcome what is it brother sister it's your enemy amen amen but
