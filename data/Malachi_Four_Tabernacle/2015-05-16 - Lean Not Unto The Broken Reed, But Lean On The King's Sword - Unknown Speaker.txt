now it came to pass in the 14th year of king hezekiah that sinatra nature king of assyria came up against all the defense cities of judah and took them and the kingdom of assyria sent rap check from lakish to jerusalem unto the king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the unto them say ye now to hezekiah saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trust is say is thou but they are but vain words i have counseled a strength for war now on whom thus thou trust that thou rebelles and the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him one in our midst we pray that you're greatly annoying to be upon us tonight given to lord are here for one purpose lord that is to contend for this perfect faith perfect i was delivered to william brandon our day of god is let us take this sword in the name amen god blessed him the brazen serpent that moses had made for us to those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it amen has we need someone to raise up in this house of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him so this was a great king this is what the for he claimed to the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded and the lord was with him and he prospered whatsoever he went forth he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him he's very angry is when you started okay upon a broken reef oh upon a broken you see brother and sister anyone the very thing that he is trying to lead against amen i mean he is trying to lean i think i say upon this broken hallelujah you're leaning upon a broken reed what you are leaning on so when it's it's going to hurt him hallelujah it's i'm he didn't have no business there it is is he put peace we were here he located his children he doesn't want his bride okay he doesn't want his wife okay that's what's possible to lean is he cleaning upon anything else if you're leaning on a crutch you know what the word crutch but let it rather be healed are you hearing me tonight make straight paths for your feet at least that which is letting me turn out of the way follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord amen he'll bring some plans is they were is let it rather be healed different colors and stuff and god was orchestrating this scene right here hallelujah oh amen and then that that you're leaning on will why amen all those millions hallelujah hallelujah you don't want people to tell you what to do but you're going to join the arm all right you have to fall but amen he is faithful and he'll is then we'll be lamenting later on um amen but jesus said i am the way you are gives us a testimony amen praising he said well you know one time he said this is passed down to me by my father amen in the words it was an inherited sin an and it in case the lord he was amen amen but i'll tell you about in the kingdom of god in this walk of the bride in this tower ain't no plan b hallelujah it's playing the word follow the word god has done this to every one of you can't when god had led him to go pray for a sick person he was crossing through the field and he comes across the killer amen amen yeah he's sharing the lord i'll say when i say no glory he's on the lord's work amen he's going to pray for somebody amen amen he's doing the right things is that what's his first reaction what's the biggest divine he wanted there wasn't no trees is you see what i'm saying ah oh please is hey man with all of the other things we're not there when we have other things amen till that crutch was taken out of isaiah's life amen man so he could lean upon the great king all right hey man what isaiah was leaning off maybe your crotch amen but sometimes there's bits of crutches you understand what i'm saying tonight people make the he said pray to god first yes amen you search god first that's your tylenol that's your pain relievers for we lean amen watching some videos or something else hallelujah for our rest for peace or for our confidence i'm confident click on everything is okay if i could just have this didn't if he has a purpose for your life amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and until we learn hallelujah those crutches oh is like if you're walking with the crutch oh is why is god purposely the very word itself says it all yeah what is the purpose of the squeeze now man you don't think about nothing else amen but whether we're not supposed to be natural man we're supposed to be supernatural he you have to pick it up hey this is what the squeeze is coming upon the bride foreign is that what the scripture when god broke their power he he'll create food amen i mean where where to learn on this where to lean on this staff hey man man we're not to lean on this stuff hallelujah shall be added that's i'll let you take control of the world do what you want i love you use all the resources use your intelligence use your education use your science associates use all of that and hallelujah yes sir in the message that i don't understand he says it's it's a strange text texts for the day that we're living in valencia because the emphasis today is certainly laid upon education and upon they go to college to complete their education you have to at least have high school a high school understanding or a college education ignorance yes sir yes but what we are finding out is that we're not to lean upon it is that right not to your own understanding the world accumulated my word is hallelujah as somewhere to lean on in the shower that's what we are depending on in the shower jesus said it's believable my sheep know my voice a voice it's his words they're not subject the things that his that's all if you lean on your own understanding today when you're sick what is it available maybe sitting in a wheelchair with cancer heart trouble the doctor says you're gonna die somebody if you lean according oh and when god tells you my perfect weakness that's when he can do special we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender we've got to come this law you've got to surrender to him i know jose because we're always wanting to put our part in something that we know you know we want to do well we say how can you have faith almost an effect when you are preferring one another when we are expecting this guy he's a great person this is a great person i'll just lean upon him listen to that this is a great person that displeases god the abilities in just look around and find whether it's right or not i don't know hallelujah what a good thing to do hey man it will never be to every person that professes get ready to die we just want the revival they will they'll be on fire of yourself hallelujah see how little the bad thing why so he can increase him see how much you can humble yourself so that he can grow i can work his head that's what is possible it's about nothing i'll tell you we can't keep this gospel i can't keep the words that we have the ability instead of depending if we can't get so many that's just a carbon knock in it it reminds amen amen that sounds wrong how's his mercy gonna be better than once amen they said and he was a pastor yeah what is it pastor that's a song oops is that's right people want power there without characters the question that's why is is before we go the lantern letting god just work through us amen amen i mean but the problem is her problem is and just just do some lunch it's all over but if if he would have been selfish if he would have kept that little lunch to himself maybe just for one of his little buddies is whatever all your theology you give that to god verse 23 where's the link to this read here let's set the lord lean not while uh let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his mind let not the rich man glorious riches valencia amen amen let him that glory glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me i am the lord which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for these things i would delight saying the lord all them which are circumcised with with the uncircumcised you hear that no amen so he says let him that glorious first corinthians chapter one verse 26 we see your calling you see your calling brother how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are the foolish things of the world to confound the wise that's right and god have chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty no necessary the best things of the world things which are despised have thought chosen gay and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are he in christ jesus who of god is made of truth wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption jesus christ gloria amen amen yes the bible says but if we through the spirit of god we mortify the deeds of the body we shall live hallelujah we shall leave all the achievements of man everything that he can do everything that he he glories science to live education to a he can rise give um he says i trust in god across the street yes hallelujah you have come as far as you could broken with the energy of the flesh with the carnal mind with to be fulfilled in us in order to bring his word to pass minions are led by the spirit of god they are the sons hallelujah how many want to say tonight so we really leaning upon that sword that proceeds from my mouth the king's soul that's the third pool lord because i know you'll never fail
