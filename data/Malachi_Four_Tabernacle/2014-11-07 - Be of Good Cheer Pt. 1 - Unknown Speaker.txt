morning I had been meditating on on this scripture for the game after receiving the Holy Spirit the reason I came back the Lord led me to the scripture last week so he mentioned that I said that means something brought that scripture back to my memories and so when that came to me I went back to my old notebook uh and I preached November the 8th because uh but what caught my attention we were just meditating because that was a Sunday morning Saturday it was my first time which will be November the 3rd because uh my first time I went to Sunset Mount you know I asked if we had one day that I thought they said and we had a tremendous experience there and then when I came back brother Robert West Robert Webster from Sacramento which is not in Sacramento anymore are attacked us and he was a brother there from the same church by the Sullivan yeah and I guess brother Solomon this was 2007 it was one of those we said brother Solomon I guess was just barely coming in the message he was

take bitterness against other people yeah right man if you've had many experiences with dogs if you people who've been in their seats that's why the Bible says I the ones that were there um and when we look at the scripture amen when we look at the scripture in Acts 27. and we look at uh the great storms that Came Upon Paul then after that Fallen Upon This Island amen he he's throwing wood in the farm Hallelujah they make people warm Glory to keep the fire going by the way you do that in the spiritual okay but watch out for the Bible to throw some wood in the fire but you're okay but make some
