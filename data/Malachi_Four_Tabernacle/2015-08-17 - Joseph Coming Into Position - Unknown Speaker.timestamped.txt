[2:56] instructions
[2:58] preparation for the the time that was

[3:13] 10 because thou H has kept the word of
[3:16] my
[3:17] patience I will also keep thee from the

[5:12] 21
[5:13] amen we'll
[5:15] read from the 34th
[5:18] [Music]
[5:21] verse amen Jesus here
[5:25] speaking of the same
[5:27] hour of Temptation
[5:31] we read uh two quotes this
[5:36] morning telling us
[5:39] plainly though that was a
[5:42] message for the Philadelphia Church
[5:45] age it was not fulfilled
[5:48] then there's something that is
[5:52] imminent for the hour in which we are
[5:54] living
[5:56] in the Reason God laid it out there
[5:59] brother bam said because it's the
[6:01] overlapping of the two
[6:04] ages amen and this in this age God is to
[6:09] do a quick and short
[6:11] work so he laid that
[6:14] before amen and then he set an Open
[6:18] Door amen between the two
[6:21] ages explains very
[6:24] plainly that that hour of Temptation
[6:26] that we read in Revelations 3
[6:30] is to come in the last
[6:32] days upon every inhabit of the
[6:36] earth and that
[6:39] Temptation amen is to take people under
[6:42] the mark of the
[6:44] beast to lead them into Great
[6:48] Tribulation amen and here we we find
[6:52] Jesus speaking our Lord speaking of
[6:56] this verse 34 take heed to yourself
[7:00] least at any time your hearts be
[7:03] overcharged with suffing that's the
[7:06] cares of of of great overloading and
[7:10] burden amen and drunkenness and cares of
[7:13] this life and so that they come upon you
[7:28] unawares
[7:32] amen see this is
[7:35] exactly what we saw this morning do we
[7:39] read that this morning in a different
[7:41] way remember what the prophet said the
[7:44] sad thing
[7:46] is that many people are not
[7:49] aware they're not ready for as a snare
[7:52] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[7:55] the face of the whole
[7:58] Earth
[8:01] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[8:03] you may be accounted worthy to escape
[8:05] all these things that shall come to pass
[8:08] and to stand before the son of
[8:20] man let's bow our heavenly father we
[8:25] thank you Lord
[8:26] God for the reading of thy holy word
[8:30] we pray oh God that you would bless it
[8:33] to our
[8:35] hearts may you Quicken it oh God for
[8:39] this letter kth but the spirit giveth
[8:43] life oh father let us Behold The
[8:46] Glory clearly oh God for the perfect
[8:52] interpretation Has Come Oh God has
[8:54] showed us that we can see face to
[8:57] face we can be
[9:00] changed into the glory that we are
[9:04] beholding oh god father we
[9:07] pray Lord that that what we're pointing
[9:10] to Lord may it reflect in our
[9:15] lives make it part of our
[9:18] character part of who we are part of our
[9:22] life Lord something that settles down
[9:25] deep on the
[9:27] soul lord with word upon
[9:30] words is being
[9:33] added oh father that Satan cannot
[9:38] interpret these things and he
[9:42] cannot
[9:43] impersonate these things father so we
[9:46] pray God that your Holy Spirit would
[9:50] give to each one Lord and come upon us
[9:53] this
[9:54] evening the spirit of
[9:57] Revelation and of wisdom
[9:59] to illuminate our
[10:01] understanding the knowledge of Jesus
[10:04] Christ to show us our
[10:07] inheritance in the name of the Lord
[10:09] Jesus
[10:11] Christ we pray amen amen you may be
[10:16] seated
[10:18] amen blessed be the name of the
[10:28] Lord
[10:31] we would like to go
[10:35] back to Genesis
[10:41] 41 amen amen we'll read two two more
[10:47] scriptures Genesis
[10:54] 41 verse
[10:56] 14 then Pharaoh sent and called
[11:00] Joseph and they brought him hastily out
[11:02] of the dungeon and he shaved himself and
[11:06] changed his
[11:07] rment and came in unto
[11:13] [Music]
[11:19] Pharaoh so this is a change of
[11:22] Rond Hallelujah this is a change of
[11:26] ministry yes sir and PHA said unto
[11:30] Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there
[11:33] is none that can interpret it and I have
[11:36] heard say of thee that thou can't
[11:39] understand a dream to
[11:49] interpret Joseph answered Pharaoh saying
[11:51] it is not in me I shall give Pharaoh an
[11:54] answer of
[11:57] peace
[12:02] amen amen now so Pharaoh tells his
[12:06] dream from there on out and then we want
[12:10] to go down to the 25th
[12:13] verse and Joseph said unto Pharaoh the
[12:17] dream of pharaoh is one God have showed
[12:20] Pharaoh what he is about to
[12:27] do
[12:31] am verse
[12:32] 29 I'm making
[12:35] emphasis on what he is
[12:38] showing concerning the
[12:41] dream being interpreted by the
[12:44] vision it's just like
[12:46] Nebuchadnezzar he had the dream but the
[12:49] dream was of
[12:51] God Daniel received the
[12:53] vision to interpret the
[12:56] dream and tell what he dreamed
[13:00] right and give the
[13:01] interpretation so this is what Joseph is
[13:04] doing by divine
[13:07] revelation Amen in Vision how many know
[13:11] that we are to be brought into that
[13:13] realm in this
[13:16] hour how many know that brother bradam
[13:18] said in the message
[13:21] mzc the great Prince that the human
[13:25] beings live in three
[13:27] realms how many know he said that how
[13:30] many so the first one is the humanistic
[13:33] realm is that right then he said then
[13:36] next is is the the the the
[13:40] realm of Revelation and vision is that
[13:44] right then he said in the third is thus
[13:48] sayith the
[13:49] Lord yes sir so we see that God promised
[13:55] to bring us into that
[13:57] real is is that right are we to go from
[14:02] justification and
[14:04] sanctification then the baptism of the
[14:06] Holy
[14:07] Spirit but from there brother Bram said
[14:11] is where the Pentecostals
[14:13] fail is that right they thought that
[14:16] being born into the
[14:18] family settled it amen hallelujah but he
[14:22] said they they failed to
[14:26] recognize he said in the message
[14:28] desperation
[14:30] the one he preached after the
[14:32] token they failed to
[14:34] recognize that there is a placing of
[14:39] son Hallelujah God is wanting to bring
[14:43] his children his wife is
[14:46] elected Amen to this realm of thus
[14:50] sayith the Lord this realm of Revelation
[14:54] and
[14:55] vision because the secret is this the
[15:00] word is in the bride she has the mind of
[15:04] Christ amen and she knows what he wants
[15:08] done with the
[15:10] word and she has thus sayith the Lord or
[15:14] she keeps
[15:15] still that's what the prophet said
[15:18] spoken word is the Original
[15:20] Seed
[15:22] 1962 so if she has th sayth the
[15:25] Lord amen she is brought into that
[15:30] see is one thing to say we have th sayth
[15:34] the Lord but it's another thing to live
[15:36] in that
[15:38] realm a prophetic class of
[15:41] people amen that is
[15:45] living under that
[15:47] realm of out of the humanistic
[15:50] realm into the realm of Revelation and
[15:54] vision too many people amen are wanting
[15:59] to
[16:00] understand this message this word of God
[16:04] by a humanistic
[16:06] realm and they try to reason it but it
[16:10] must come by divine
[16:13] revelation and the
[16:15] Revelation gives you a vision of the
[16:18] word hallelujah we see that from his
[16:23] childhood
[16:24] days Joseph had a vision of he would sit
[16:29] on the throne and that his brothers
[16:32] would bow to him Hallelujah he saw
[16:37] himself as a
[16:39] sheath mature how do he know that there
[16:42] was one in our days that was the first
[16:45] one to reach
[16:47] maturity he was the first grain of wheat
[16:51] he was the sheath to reach
[16:54] maturity amen he was the first one in
[16:58] this spiritual
[17:00] Resurrection out of dark
[17:03] denominationalism to rise and be lifted
[17:07] up into that cloud 30 mil High 25 miles
[17:13] across he changed his rment he was
[17:17] placed here ye him full Authority and
[17:21] power brother Roy
[17:24] Robertson had the dream remember he said
[17:27] is there something about a cloud upon a
[17:31] mountain he said yes Matthew
[17:35] 17 remember my message hear ye him he
[17:40] said he has been given power to speak
[17:44] things into
[17:45] existence amen standing in the Gap
[17:49] message yes sir brother these things are
[17:53] realities this ain't playing church amen
[17:58] this is reality of the word of God and
[18:01] He is wanting to bring the church to lay
[18:05] aside the
[18:06] foundation of repentance of laying on of
[18:10] hands amen and let's go Forward Unto

[1:19:57] thing
[1:19:59] siru we're still black and black and
[1:20:02] white is
[1:20:04] white we still got an
[1:20:07] absolute we still have a TI post and
[1:20:10] that's the word of almighty
[1:20:12] God Amen and in the days after Jesus
[1:20:17] after the son of man had been
[1:20:20] revealed amen and he had discerned
[1:20:23] he had called your name is Simon son of
[1:20:26] Jonas he had revealed the
[1:20:29] Messiah after that
[1:20:31] Ministry come the book of Acts is that
[1:20:35] right in the book of Acts Amen in
[1:20:39] chapter
[1:20:40] 11 amen there was one that rose up and
[1:20:46] prophesied said there's coming a
[1:20:49] famine remember that agabus
[1:20:53] in the Bible Acts 11 listen what the
[1:20:57] prophet says in the lean Church age
[1:21:01] concerning this he
[1:21:04] says first this
[1:21:08] age will have only one Prophet
[1:21:13] messenger Revelations
[1:21:16] 10:7 when he singular shall begin to
[1:21:21] sound there has never been an
[1:21:24] age God gave his people two Major
[1:21:28] Prophets at this at one time he gave
[1:21:32] Enoch
[1:21:33] alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses
[1:21:38] alone and he alone had the word through
[1:21:41] others
[1:21:43] prophesy John the Baptist
[1:21:46] Alone look what he's saying then he says
[1:21:49] here in the last day there is to be
[1:21:53] one
[1:21:55] Prophet we're not waiting for another
[1:21:59] Prophet amen amen amen hallelujah the
[1:22:05] mystery is
[1:22:08] finished but the thing is it's got to be
[1:22:11] finished to
[1:22:13] you it's got to be revealed to
[1:22:15] you
[1:22:17] see the prophet said trying to do God a
[1:22:20] Ser without being his will
[1:22:23] not the years in
[1:22:24] preparation but when he shall begin to
[1:22:26] sound the
[1:22:27] trumpet in the Rapture message he says
[1:22:31] when I was in the healing
[1:22:33] campaign I knew all the time there had
[1:22:36] to come a
[1:22:38] message that's what he said but now look
[1:22:42] one major prophet he says now this last
[1:22:47] day there's one
[1:22:49] prophet and the infallible word say
[1:22:54] that he the prophet will reveal the
[1:22:57] Mysteries to the end time
[1:22:59] people and turn the hearts of the
[1:23:01] children back to the
[1:23:03] fathers
[1:23:05] those there are those who
[1:23:07] say that God's
[1:23:10] people are going to come
[1:23:14] together through a collective
[1:23:19] Revelation I challenge that statement
[1:23:25] I'm reading the
[1:23:26] quote hu it is a
[1:23:31] ball invalid
[1:23:34] assumption in the face of Revelations
[1:23:38] 107
[1:23:40] listen now I do not
[1:23:45] deny that the people will
[1:23:49] prophesy in this last age my Hallelujah
[1:23:54] is there going to be a people that
[1:23:56] prophesies in the last days well you got
[1:23:59] to check the
[1:24:02] prophecy did did Micaiah prophesy after
[1:24:08] Elijah amen did he check his vision with
[1:24:12] Elijah's
[1:24:16] prophecy amen and when he when he
[1:24:19] checked it with the prophet's message
[1:24:23] he knew it was
[1:24:25] right Amen brother there's a prophetic
[1:24:29] anointing that is loosed for a prophetic
[1:24:33] class of
[1:24:34] people is that what he
[1:24:37] said so but it's got to be according to
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:41] word because you can have a lot of say
[1:24:44] the Lord this and
[1:24:45] that and it's not the word sounds
[1:24:49] beautiful amen sounds great
[1:24:54] amen like Billy Paul told Brother BR
[1:24:57] remember amen uh Grand Grandma
[1:25:02] sharan right he said th he said the
[1:25:05] walls were
[1:25:07] sweating he said the the anointing was
[1:25:11] strong
[1:25:13] amen people were in the
[1:25:15] spirit the anointing was strong the
[1:25:18] walls were
[1:25:20] sweating and someone rose up said thus
[1:25:22] sayth the Lord she shall live to see the
[1:25:26] coming of the
[1:25:29] Lord you
[1:25:31] see and Billy had already
[1:25:34] heard amen his father
[1:25:36] say the Lord

[1:25:46] understand what
[1:25:48] happened you said she's going to die
[1:25:51] then there they said thus say the Lord
[1:25:53] she's going to live to the coming of the
[1:25:56] Lord said he didn't speak against
[1:26:00] that he didn't he says all I know Billy
[1:26:04] is everything he's ever told me has
[1:26:07] never
[1:26:09] failed that's all I
[1:26:11] know Billy said I
[1:26:17] understood amen see it's not according
[1:26:20] to the word
[1:26:23] amen amen there's nothing
[1:26:25] there now look he says I do not deny
[1:26:29] that the people will prophesy in this
[1:26:31] last
