========================================
and we like to open our Bibles tonight first Thessalonians verse 16 finishing the scriptures first Thessalonians verse amen amen Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you grench not the spirit not propes prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil very God of Peace sanctify you holy I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ fath is he that also will do God bless Hallelujah I believe we spoken on the scripture but just to start our line of inspiration tonight that we might All tune in to the channel of God and understand what the spirit is speaking and be able to hear his voice amen amen hallelujah you can only hear his voice we are tuned in to that Supernatural Channel you have seen already the the sequence that God has showing [Music] us and we we are going to continue in that line book of Acts but felt the the Holy Spirit today lead me on on something and you want to take enough time in this to Anchor it down into our hearts and souls and see results by the holy spirit in our lives and I believe it will help us all and I believe it's a call for every one of us a greater dedication and a greater Consecration and that's what I want to title this this inspirationall uh to understand this scripture that Paul is speaking We Know by [Music] historians and in the history of the book of Acts the first letter that Paul wrote was Thessalonians and this is a tremendous letter it's a tremendous book uh epist in which he brings a tremendous Revelations and We Know by the message of the hour that God has given to us that first Thessalonians chapter 4 speaks of our day amen if you would like to turn there as we want to lay this scripture out the scene of chapter five you read we know that first Thessalonians 4 uh it says verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the archangel with the Trump of God and the dead and crash shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord that's first Thessalonians we know that's this message simplified form it's the Lord himself that has descended Revelation 10 Mighty Angel Christ coming down from heaven with open book hand amen and he sent that book down to the seventh angel to open the seals and these seven Thunders these Mysteries begin to utter on the earth this Revelation is going to give a faith was going to give a Quicken power said will this be the thing that will anoint us that will change these vile bodies that will make us leap over walls amen amen he was he was asking sir is this the sign of the end could this be the time that God is going to bring this this Revelation Hallelujah was saying that in 62 DEC he saw the vision the seven angels coming he was asking could this be if the vision was scriptural he said then it must be in the scripture if the vision is of god it must be scriptural and that's the first time his very Ministry to [Music] revelation we know that Revelations is theeven SE this is the vision and when he receives this Revelation this great mystery begins to unfold well we know that that's for a purpose we know that that is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father we know that is to bring a loosing of the holy spirit because he brother said it had been bound the holy you can B it working in the People by Creeds and dogas denominational rivers and had been bound amen by all these nearly 2,000 years said what is to be let loose in the evening time by the evening time message brother said the evening time message at the opening and this was the loing the Holy Spirit amen so that it can work in us through us our hearts back to that original Faith so this is what we're seeing here the Lord himself has beened with the shout we waiting for this the Lord already amen amen said it's a shout to gather the bride amen and he said in the first seal that the seven Thunders is to gather the bride for rapturing it's the same thing mess open the word all this is synonymous so look this is what we're and chapter five is after that at the beginning of chapter five uh he Paul tells the Thessalonians the same thing that Jesus told the disciples in one amen that times and Seasons you have no need to know well that's the seven SE spoke on that before because Jesus spoke of that not only in one but in Matthew 24 amen amen amen the time the things only not [Music] even told us in the SE heed the seven SE was SEC open so he he he is in chapter four speaking of the coming of that seventh seal is the seven seal what is theeven SE the Lord himself is the Lord coming down coming of but then in chapter he begins to seal it up and and leave it in mystery and he speaks of the day when they will say peace and safety and then sudden destruction will come and he begins to talk about the children of the day and the Children of the Night those that are drunken the wine of her fornication sleep that's what the system of this Roman system has done to the whole world the Bible say they're all drunk they're all asleep they're all unconscious how does how are they drunken how are they asleep with all of the entertainment that has been put out there drunken with drunken with drunken with all kinds of social entertainment there sleep don't know it's all a great trap but the seven Thunders was going to aw the the Bible speaks a lot about people sleeping even from the book of Isaiah Jesus spoke of those who are asleep not asleep literally no human beings they live they eat they they work they do everything but in the spiritual realm amen amen hallelujah said take seven to wake Hallelujah while everybody's asleep there's somebody that is awake but I want to get to this here after he goes through all of that then he he sets this he begins to show us in the spirit amenu begins to show us Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing amen everything give thanks PR not the spirit despise not prophesy amen prove all things hold fast to that which is good see stain from all appearance of evil see sometimes brother Adam said it's not that we're doing evil but what we do has an appearance how many know that's the Bible how many know that's the message that's why brother Bram certain things in the message that people may want to ignore but they there maybe they're just don't it's not that sometimes we want to be religious is that sometimes we want to follow what the word says there's many things that socalled Christians or denominations do amen that have appearances ofil amen the word is calling Usain from all appearance of and then he says in verse 23 and the Very God of Peace amen how many know that this is the day when the God of Peace has made himself known amen didn't he say it is Shalom for the bride in this hour Shalom unto the Bride of Jesus Christ Romans 16 said the God of Peace will quickly put Satan under your feet amen that's speaking to us of this last day the God of Peace brother bam said what was that cloud that appeared and the picture they took brother bam said that we preach on this before he said what was that what was that great that was Shalom that was jvh that was the one that told Moses I am that I am over there he was in a burning bush here he was in a cloud the God of Peace he said what was that shalom shalom so the God of Peace says sanctify you hold the scripture there scripture the god the very God of Peace verse 23 sanctify you holy amen amen so that is what we're looking at tonight that word San means from from AEK word which means it means to be dedicated the very God of Peace Sanctified that word means to be dedicated to be set aside brother Saidi set aside for Hallelujah see the devil just likes to do that every every time I come up to preaches to restart the whole thing by itself so watch the very God of Peace sanctify you holy the word that is used there for sanctify is hag which means to hollow it means to be holy to render or acknowledge or to be vulnerable or H to separate from profane things to dedicate to God to consecrate to purify amen amen hallelujah to consecrate the very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so this is where we got our inspiration because let us let us turn want to turn to Colossians chapter 1 Hallelujah 15 19 Colossians verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church was the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things see the head of the church that in all things he might have the preeminence the father in him all amen now we got these scriptural [Music] bases to show us amen this inspiration tonight this is a a revelation of full surrenderance this is a revelation of full preeminence he is to have full preeminence in a in a bride in this hour the prophet taught us that if you want to really know more or hear more about this from the prophet listen to the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed you'll hear the prophet read the same scripture in Colossians you'll hear the prophet say God had preeminence in Jesus Christ and he is to have preeminence oversight leadership full control in his body the brother amen hallelujah hallelujah everything that was in God into Christ Christ said I do nothing except I see the father show me first amen amen he was fully surrendered to the of God would not go anywhere he would not do anything without God having preeminence amen amen see and this full preeminence that he wants to have in the bride in this hour remember we have spoke before on the burnt offering is that right how many remember that judges when Gideon was going to face the midianites amen amen after a prophet had came and gave his message the angel of God visited Gideon in the message have not I sent thee said's AE of the church and and if God be with us where be all his miracles brother bam said Gideon had been listening to the message of the Prophet amen hallelujah you have gone off the scene but the midianites the enemy was coming taking his Harvest taking everything they had amen amen amen M but before that Gideon could take and use the sword of the Lord because he's the one that screamed the sword of the Lord and the Hallelujah before you could say that there had to be a consecration had to be a burnt offering you had to tear down the altar that his father had for Idols amen and edify an altar for God and offer a burnt offering before he could handle the sword of the Lord amen we see that pattern I mentioned it the other day we see that pattern throughout the entire Bible from Genesis with Noah after came out of the Ark he gave a burn offering and then God showed him the token said in the token message and the Bible says in Genesis that rainbow was a token of God amen amen but before the token what is the token brother bam said the token is what made the tumor disappear to my wife what that third po power what's that the spoken word you understand but before the token Noah needed a burnt offering see a consecration that's what burn offering represents because it was to be given holy that's what the Bible said a burnt offering was holy given unto the Lord it wasn't just one part of it it was all given amen the the intros amen everything the body the meat the fat the strength amen the head the body everything was given fly given to the Lord that's why Paul is saying under the inspiration amen that the God of Peace May sanctify you holy amenu complete dedication amen a complete consecration is that right so the burnt offering is a sign to the bride this hour that there is need of complete death of self amen death to thoughts ideas Pride lust every halfway Christianity must be put on the altar of sacrifice to be burned by fire then comes the spirit of the Lord to be upon you if you read Judges chapter 6 until he did all of that with the burn offering until then the spirit of the Lord came upon Him amen hallelujah then he was able to go forth amen make the milites run is that right cause confusion in their Camp make them kill one another hallelujah hallelujah and run see giving them dreams about gide himself putting fear in your hearts why because he fully but before that brother said he was a scary he was hiding was running wasn't facing the challenge understand amen said full obedience entitles us to the Token brother said that before we can see the miracle before we can see the [Music] miracle we must be a miracle ourselves we must become a miracle of God then we can see the miracle brother Bram said that's the greatest Miracle there is is's a new birth amen amen in the message Paradox he spoke of many paradoxes stopping the sun opening the sea all these things he said but the greatest Paradox is the new birth amen amen so before we can see a miracle we must be a miracle ourselves we must become a miracle of God then we can see the miracle the token comes after of the burn offer the token is the power to fulfill the promises of the word amen it's the power for the Paradox it's in the token the token is the third PO is the power of the word is the power the Dynamics it's going to rise us out of here it's going to lift us up going to take us away catch us away amen amen hallelujah isn't that what we're looking for isn't that what we're all striving for amen see amen so as I've said we can go through many things Abraham on the mountain he offered he was going to offer I told him you you want to see spoken word power offer your son as a burn offer he did that amen amen he saw the creative power of God all right elah upon M carel had a burnt offering before the fire could fall from Heaven and burn the sacrifice and bring restore the rain back to his amen amen and he reped the altar see He restored to bring the hearts of the children back to the burn Jesus was the burnt offering offering killed on the on the north side of Jerusalem yes sir then the fire came down upon the 120 is that right so the same thing Solomon in dedicating the temple before the glory could fill the temple he offered burn offerings hundreds of Amen see that's the pattern of the Bible burn offering first then the supernatural burn offering first then the the power to fulfill the promises of God burd offering first then the token and the token is the power to fulfill the promises of God and the Hebrew word for burnt offering is Ola which means that which Ascend and smoke to God being holy burnt reduced to ashes as a sweet smelling sa amen it could either be a bulock a her sheep fouls amen all of those things were offered in Burn offer bur bear sacrifice amen all of those things so in this hour that we live in brother BR became a burn offering his life amen and he said it himself we want to read tonight a little bit the message why Christ speak July 63 the B says lay aside everything else contrary to it remember this this is the truth regardless of how Financial how fin ially it seems everything else sometimes move right on with it it's the Holy Spirit the same God that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead the same one that can speak things into existence same one that lived in the days of Moses is the same today his call in this last day he's a vind as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man there is a Sodom down there there's a Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts out here and the church is moving on by the same signs that he promised both places there they are it is as he said oh Lord give me courage is my prayer help me oh Lord God I have to quit here it's getting late he say why cry to me why are you crying to me when I have proved to be with you haven't I healed your sick he' say brother bam is showing us that the message that he is preaching why Christ speak although this is 63 it's already seen things being created into existence he's already seen the opening of the word he's already seen Mighty things he's not praying for the Holy Ghost he already has it this is what people don't understand there is times when you need a rededication you need consecration you need to do something in your life amen to continue to advance if not you're going to be stagnant you're going to become still amen stale like bread that gets stale amen gets hard good you you you must realize that these things are necessary to advance with God that's why people become religious that's why people become bitter that's why people don't have no fruits of God in their life they have come to a certain point with God they have come to the word they love God they want to serve God but they don't know where to start they don't know what to do you understand what I'm saying this is what God is calling us he's trying to show us that we can see and understand this that this is needed in all of our Lives we we're not called to this just to come up to a certain point point in the message and then just stay stagnant there is need of a dynamic power in our lives and brother bam said the Dynamics for this bride is going to be a refilling he didn't say a filling in order to have a refilling you have to have first aill then a refilling amen so Dynamics to the mechanics a refilling of the Holy Ghost he said well rise this bride in the hallelujah amen amen this is the hour this is the time for that there's no time to waste so oh I'll consecrate my my life and I I'll get deeper with God when are you going to do it when are we going to come to that point God is calling our attention amen hallelujah watch what the prophet says here he said God give me courage to take the sword of the word he put in my hand about 33 years ago hold it March forward to the third pool my prayer he says let us bow our heads Heavenly Father the hour is growing late but the word is getting precious see although the conditions are getting worse in the world surroundings and brother bam said that in itself makes it hard for you to pray said questions and answers he said another reason why it's hard for people to get into prayer because there's no Ral pris not Pentecostal Revival they have an they have a different idea what a Revival is Prophet laid it out and showed us what Revival is rival people get back to the word hallelujah amen line themselves up with the word now watch he said the word is getting precious and we see it Lord Time After Time never failing presence of Christ always meets with us how I thank you for your goodness have you separated us you have blessed us and how we thank you for I hold these handkerchiefs in my hand Lord It's people that has faith that believes this every devil every sickness depart from them people I charge every spirit in here that's foul and not of God every Spirit of sickness all diseases and affliction we're not laying in the shadow of a man which would be all right but we're in the shadow of the [Music] Gospel Vindicated go as the great Pillar of Fire moves back and forth through this building the same one that looked down through the Red Sea give up its course and Israel passed through but now as he looks it sprinkled with the blood of his own son when mercy and Grace that we be obedient may we today quit saying quit crying out May we realize that you have called us for this work this is the hour I speak it in the name of Jesus Christ let every sickness depart from this place every man and woman that calls on the name of Jesus Christ consecrate their life a new today I consecrate mine Lord upon the altar of prayer I lay myself down I shame my own self and turn my head towards the ground where you took me Lord God I'm ashamed of my weakness and my unbelief forgive it Lord give me courage give us all courage I feel like Moses we're all on our road out we don't want to leave one we want to take everyone they're yours I claim them for you bless these people today Lord grant it bless me with them Father thy name shall be praised th Glory shall be thine give us this eternal Faith Lord as we consecrate ourselves to thee me over this Bible over this stand I give you my life Lord I'm depending on every promise that you give I know they will be confirmed I know they are truth give me courage to speak these words give me courage Lord direct me and what I should do and say I give myself to you with this church in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen he says now together with our hands up congregation repeats this prayer amen let us do that Lord Jesus I now consecrate myself to thee a life of service a lifeice more purely more faith I cry that I might be more acceptable servant in my coming life than I have been in the life that's pass forgive my unbelief and restore to us the faith that was once delivered to I give myself to thee in the name of Jesus Christ now as we bow our heads while life's dark Ma I tra and grief around me spread be thou my God B Darkness turn today wash all my fears away nor let me ever Stam from the side as we bow our heads you feel like he said the morning message has done you good says amen give you courage amen if you would just raise your hands to God saying thank you God I got my both hands up because I just feel that it's help me give me courage some things I said I don't think I was going to say but it's already said it was a rebuke to me I found myself not in the way that I thought I did but I found myself guilty of crying out all the time instead of speaking God help me from this hour on that I'll be a more consecrated servant not only me I pray for I pray for you also that together as a body of Christ Christ called out from the world making ready for the promised land that God will give me courage to speak the way make the way clear that you won't miss the trail I tell you by the grace of God I'll follow the bloody Footprints of him who went before us amen amen we give this to thee father consecration in the name of Jesus Christ th son we thank the Lord for this walk a consecrated life give yourself over to sweetness humility walk in the spirit walk talk dress act like Christians humble and sweet don't let fail fail now the voice of God speaks through the word speaks through gifts as one gift comes another one expresses it that sure right with the word and right with the hour God is with us how we thank him for it with our heads bound he says a realization that Jesus said that Hearth my words believe on him that sent me have eternal life you shall not come up in the Judgment but has passed from Death un life knowing that we by the grace of God possess that within our bosom with a consecration to him this morning that our lives shall change from this day on will be more positive in our think we will try to live in such sweetness and humility believing that we ask God God will give it to each other and we will not speak evil against each other no shall pray for our enemies love them do good to them that do bad to us God is the judge right so after brother bam preached this amen and I believe that this is stimulating us to amen amen but after he said this in the morning why Christ speak speaking much about consecrating that evening he preached humble thyself and this is what he said as I brought that statement this morning the people was laying in the shadow of Peter they never even asked for prayer I have went into many homes watching this pray before I go and just go in there with the anointing don't even pray for the people walk out and they healing that's right I've seen it done so many times you've got to have you've got to have somewhere to place your faith you've got to believe it and I believe that the hour is approaching and now is says I realize that this is not a tape service might make a little one for themselves this is not a tape that goes on across the country this what I was speaking of this morning has brought us right up to a climax and that's the reason that I'm going to take next Sunday for healing service because since I have been home I told you about the visions and what's happened and everything and he brought it right up and why I have done all these things he says and this morning bringing it up now to the last pool now he says it's my time for consecration to God God's time to speak to me me I must just have a little change in my own life not as I think that I'm wicked but I want to feel a little more closer to people the people that I have tried to tell this gospel truth to you turn their back on walk away and laugh at not to me that seems like it's an insult I don't care but to the things that I've been saying is the truth trying to help them like shoving out a boat and say here it comes cross over get get out of the swelling stream you're going to die you're going to perish and they just laugh at you walk away well to me it feel like if you want to walk away there's nothing more that I can do about it see that I can do but I want to run down the bank now persuade them come back see I've got to have that feeling because I know there's somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and I'm going to fish he said until the last fish is I to so brother says now is my time amen for consecration hallelujah amen now it's my time for consecration to God this God's time to speak to me amen hallelujah let us turn in our Bibles to the book of Jo chapter 2 we'll speak just for few more minutes I just wanted to lay just this thought out I believe God has given us a call chapter 2 we know that this is or it speaks of this restoration [Music] speaking amenu this is this is the time that he is saying [Music] that these demonic Powers have taken away from the Church of the Living God and he is going to restore this he's going to bring a full restoration amen amen hallelujah he's going to bring the same Faith back in us I believe brothers and sisters that we have seen uh much of this already but we want to see more of itam said in perfect faith we have seen we want to see more of it amen amen and this is just a call for deeper consecration amen a deeper walk with the Lord amen that we might dedicate ourselves more to him and in J chapter 2 you want to read here verse 15 blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify call gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children those that up the brast let the bridegroom go forth his chamber and the bride ad of her CL let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar let them say spread thy people oh Lord give not thine Heritage to reproach that the Heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God then will the Lord be jealous for his land P his people yeah the Lord will answer and sayto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil you should be satisfied there with and I will no more make you a reproach among the Heath amen amen verse 23 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God we have given you former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat the vat shall overflow with wine and oil now restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the korm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you you shall eat in plenty be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed it shall come to pass afterward I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my amen so this is a call amen this is the trumpet sounding in Zion calling for a consecration Amen brother says as we stand to our feet the message presuming he says I tell you what let me say to the members of this church here I say it to any members of church you consecrate this church to God and all of its members see consecrated it to God every one of you with a holy life before God and watch what will take place when that church binds itself and starts praying those the prayers of those people begin to go up before God he will not turn it down that's right now I'm just one there will be many of you here praying and Divine Healing doesn't lay with any certain person it's sincere hearts that pray to God sincere people who receive it amen amen amen what God can do to consecrate ourselves amen as individuals as a church amen what man calls great God calls foolish message expectation what man calls foolish God calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human being there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen he says in testimony my Christian friends and sinner friends whatever you do if you me believe me to be sent from God you seek the kingdom of God just as quick as you can get in into it for it's the only safety we have today the world's at the End of the Age only in Christ you are saved I'm not saying that to scare you I'm saying it just as Sly as I know how to stand here this platform and say it but my heart's been stirred for a time I know that we're ready for something now come in and you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time now I don't know why I stopped in my speech to say that I could prove that I'd be willing to say that it's the spirit of God there that's speaking right now a warning to you that's right remember I'm saying that under the anointing of the spirit of God amuah the message of expectation said that's what I want you to do it's prayer that I depend on that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you receive what you ask for and God will make it amen love him tonight amen let us pray heavenly father in this hour God you work in mysterious ways father your wonders to perform father Lord we don't understand you many times your different ways Lord You're PE you're peculiar in the way that you give us your word father many times it comes differently may we acknowledge that father but one thing I am sure Lord that your spirit is in control of all these things may we may we be sensitive to that know and understand you're calling us in this hour Lord you have led us on this subject on this series showing us this time of restoration showing us that you said Lord I will restore all that the loc canm the caterpillar oh Lord God this is the the evening

the Paradox we seen oh God the token on display we seen the power of your word Lord we seen that Supreme faith master of all circumstance Supreme control oh when he would say Lord I take every Spirit

the in the meeting that when you would say that through your Prophet Lord even the animals would become Silent People Lord would get quiet oh in a reverence would come upon everything Supreme control
