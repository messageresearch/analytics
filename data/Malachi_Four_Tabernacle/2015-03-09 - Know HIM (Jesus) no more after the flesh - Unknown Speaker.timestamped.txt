[1:02:20] yeah though we have known christ after
[1:02:22] the flesh
[1:02:24] yet now henceforth know him no more
[1:02:42] that's why what is our subject today
[1:02:45] feeding on the unfailing body
[1:02:59] no more knowing him after the
[1:03:09] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:03:11] a new creature all things are passed
[1:03:13] away behold all things
[1:03:23] and all things are of god who have
[1:03:25] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:03:28] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:03:31] reconciliation
[1:03:41] with that god was in christ reconciling
[1:03:44] the world and
[1:03:45] unto himself and repeating their
[1:03:46] trespasses upon them and have committed
[1:03:48] to us the words of reconciliation
[1:03:52] reconciliant
[1:04:07] you believe in
[1:04:10] that the same
[1:05:33] yes because in him was to be fulfilled
[1:05:38] the same ministry
[1:05:40] of the son of man
[1:05:43] everything the same only one except the
[1:05:45] purple body
[1:05:50] doesn't make him jesus christ
[1:05:54] that's a ministry for me
[1:05:56] to reveal
[1:05:57] the word again
[1:06:02] we're
[1:06:30] and this message has done the same thing
[1:06:33] i've brought it to you many quotes
[1:06:35] hey man i mean but sometimes the level
[1:06:40] of what we're receiving
[1:06:43] it it's not as looking at it
[1:06:46] in the same pattern
[1:06:48] over here i have this and then this
[1:06:51] and over here
[1:06:53] this and then this it says
[1:06:54] we don't look at it like that
[1:06:56] we just look at it like another quote
[1:08:09] amen i mean maybe they're anointed with
[1:08:11] that same spirit
[1:08:13] speech
[1:08:33] oh
[1:09:04] did less and we do this and we do that
[1:09:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:16] all they have is
[1:09:31] wow
[1:09:49] it's all in in
[1:09:52] iran
[1:09:56] how many how many know the brother on
[1:09:58] the tape that you hear saying
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:25] foreign
[1:10:42] but i don't
[1:11:07] is
[1:11:24] that's a
[1:11:47] is
[1:12:04] i got a little piece of this that's the
[1:12:06] rest of that game
[1:12:34] yes
[1:12:49] all the people that were with brother
[1:12:50] brown
[1:12:54] what was yours
[1:12:56] that's good you see what i'm saying
[1:12:59] that's good
[1:13:00] i like to hear i mean
[1:13:02] i heard billy paul
[1:13:27] and then
[1:13:29] because of that
[1:13:44] because they only knew him after the
[1:13:46] flesh
[1:13:49] they didn't really know him by
[1:13:51] revelation
[1:13:54] what they
[1:13:56] talked about the way they saw the
[1:14:53] brother
[1:15:15] foreign
[1:16:04] revelation
[1:16:45] build it upon
[1:17:00] hallelujah
[1:17:40] we've got more of a revelation than you
[1:17:42] paulo
[1:18:48] oh
[1:19:06] now
[1:19:20] you can't
[1:19:29] oh
[1:19:59] yes
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:58] express himself in the pillar of fights
[1:21:00] because that's not right forever paul
[1:21:01] being the truth
[1:21:03] he receives a revelation
[1:21:05] by his experience
[1:21:11] he received a revelation
[1:21:25] your experience listening
[1:21:40] yesterday today
[1:22:15] he is
[1:22:36] that
[1:23:46] oh
[1:24:00] he'll make
[1:24:13] because he knows
[1:24:37] hallelujah
[1:24:39] that's what i said it might be strong
[1:24:40] for some questions
[1:24:56] there's many that know him only after
[1:24:59] the flesh
[1:25:04] i know i'm after this
[1:25:07] that's not
[1:25:24] i
[1:25:52] that
[1:26:07] is himself
[1:26:12] amen he says amen do you see it
[1:26:16] expressed by the word itself
[1:26:33] through jesus christ
[1:26:48] you can
[1:27:02] that means
[1:27:28] is
[1:27:44] has
[1:27:58] what
[1:28:39] hallelujah
[1:28:54] of
[1:29:07] oh
[1:29:22] if you can hear
[1:29:36] hallelujah
[1:29:50] and i am
[1:30:17] hallelujah
[1:30:59] for your
[1:31:42] he's already paid
[1:32:11] to eden is there a guess right there
[1:32:14] that's where
[1:32:15] the fullness
[1:32:17] of the word
[1:32:19] the fullness of the god
[1:32:22] is in that place
[1:32:35] is
[1:32:40] sometimes i feel like i'm saying things
[1:32:42] it's just
[1:32:43] just
[1:32:49] questions and answers
[1:32:51] questions 1964
[1:33:15] there's quite a difference i believe
[1:33:17] jesus christ was the son of man the son
[1:33:19] of god the son of man the same thing
[1:33:32] i am not the anointed son of man
[1:33:46] but i say that sometimes because i want
[1:33:48] you to give it
[1:34:44] unless
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:28] so the pillar of fire is what if it was
[1:35:30] king what is the pillar of fire
[1:35:34] an attribute
[1:35:35] of the fullness
[1:35:40] when
[1:37:17] the right hand means power
[1:37:46] through
[1:39:05] but now he's bottled and confined in the
[1:39:08] whole universal church of the living
[1:39:23] he is
[1:39:50] unless he knew it was the same logos
[1:40:34] himself now in the last day
[1:40:38] the lowest that was upon jesus
[1:40:40] has become from a back to the pillar of
[1:40:43] fire
[1:40:46] and has descended down on the earth
[1:41:02] you see the son of david
[1:41:07] he saw the son of man
[1:41:13] that's why
[1:41:15] we have to see
[1:41:26] what is the revelation in this hour
[1:41:32] right now i would have
[1:41:35] are we feeding on the son of man
[1:41:38] on the son of god
[1:41:43] i don't mean to be tricky
[1:41:45] but i'm just saying
[1:41:48] it's true
[1:41:50] we're feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:41:54] of man
[1:41:56] when john saw him said
[1:42:12] is
[1:43:04] this is something else
[1:43:06] this is
[1:43:36] hallelujah
[1:43:47] what i'm saying
[1:44:04] on
[1:44:17] upon jesus
[1:44:46] like an investigation
[1:44:51] that's why jesus
[1:44:53] knew exactly what he was saying
[1:45:00] he wasn't just
[1:45:28] in another mystical body today this is
[1:45:56] this is
[1:46:34] in jesus name
[1:46:53] it
[1:47:32] is
[1:47:43] yes
[1:48:01] is
[1:48:16] amen oh my are you doing what he says
[1:48:20] now
[1:48:22] this great pillar of fire is going to
[1:48:24] live without absolutely identified even
[1:48:27] scientific cameras
[1:48:44] i believe it's still there isn't it
[1:48:46] like that yes it's still there
[1:48:50] scientifically proven by the best we got
[1:48:52] george j lacy head of the fbi
[1:48:55] foreign
[1:49:12] jesus
[1:49:23] until it has come
[1:49:25] to be the hedge
[1:49:41] of man the son of god the son of david
[1:49:46] i am the rose of sharon the lily of the
[1:49:48] valley the morning star

[1:52:13] not the son of man
[1:52:14] himself but the seventh angel
[1:52:18] the seventh messenger
[1:52:20] is revealing to the public
[1:52:23] the son of man
