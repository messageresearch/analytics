TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how many knows that the bride in this hour has been called up to amen amenu said there's been three showdowns in the scripture or there's three showdowns in the Bible the message spoken where the Original Seed said the first was on Mount carel amen he said the second was on Mount Transfiguration he said and then the bride amen there will have there will be a showdown for the Rapture and Jesus Will Be The Showdown among the denominations said and the third Showdown is on Mount or the Rapture of the Bride so the bride has been called to Mount Zion she will be raptured from Zion how many know where physically or literally Zion is it is in the city of Jerusalem but it's a special mount that is close to the temple that is supposed to be there and I believe will be rebuilt on the temple Mountain amen so that's where M Zion is literally but Mount Zion spiritually is Heavenly places in Christ am amen hallelujah hallelujah and with him 144,000 now notice this is speaking of these elected seed Jews whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world because notice they have the revelation of the father's name amen they have received that Revelation brother said in the message 10 virgins and 144,000 that the mark in the forehead means you have received a revelation amen hallelujah now verse two and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a great Thunder amen and I heard the voice of Harpers harp with their hearts amen amen and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders no man could learn that song but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the Earth [Music] these are they which were not defiled with women amen they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb withs soever he goeth hallelujah amen these were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no gu Hallelujah for they are without fault Before the Throne of God amen heavenly father thank you Lord God reading of your word we ask that you bless it give us the context father remove Lord everything contrary to your word father if we have come here tonight we hear from you oh God let our hearts Lord reflect that here tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated am what a tremendous scripture we see here again going back to the seventh trumpet a little bit tonight because we have seen that brother bam says in the Feast of the trumpets paragraph 155 he says the continuity of the scripture is exactly the same under the seventh trumpet is to Israel the same as the seven seal was to the church so we see that the seventh trumpet to the Jews as we were seeing Sunday is the same as the seventh seal the revelations 10 to the Bride of Jesus Christ we see how that ties in perfectly with the word amen and we want to continue on this thought tonight just to strike another portion of it brother ROM goes on to say his well Feast of the trumpets paragraph 270 he says as soon as this church the bride uh and is is draw together she has taken up and that mystery of the seven seal the mystery going he says the Jews is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses now notice again he is comparing amen the seventh seal is what is the mystery that's going to take the bride amen that's the mystery of the Rapture amen hallelujah so that's another another portion showing us what the seven seal is about amen we know that there was silence but seven Thunders under of their voices on the earth amen amen so we see then hallelujah hallelujah that the seven seal will Rapture the the Gentile bride then he says then the Jews are called by the m of the seventh trumpet see so the bride receives a mystery of the seven seal and the Jews 144,000 receive the mystery of the seventh trumpet Hallelujah he says that that is two prophets Elijah you find that Revelations 11 amenu and then as we seen Sunday the seventh trumpet continues on even after they are killed and they're slaughtered amen after the three years and a half of mos Elijah's preaching so the seventh trumpet amen is in mystery form Amen in Revelations 11 by Elijah and Moses amen the mystery the seven trumpet it's two prophets then they fulfill the three years and a half hallelujah amen we we were speaking of this Sunday just picking it up back right there so notice once the three years and a half are over then God can pour out his complete wrath and Destroy them that destroy the Earth is that right that's where the seven trumpet continues amen it connects with the Vib and that's what we seen on Sunday but we want to get into the mystery part now in other words we're backing up to Moses and Elijah within the three years and a half and then at the same time that Revelation 14 now listen to this this is powerful right here amen amen you got to catch how it's being placed here Revelations 14 is 144,000 amen and they're on Mount Zion I'm going to read you a quote right now and brother bam says that joh that John saw him in Revelations 14 amen and he said here they had come to the temple amen amen which is already rebuilt and he said they come to worship Jesus hallelujah hallelujah so brother this has to be here and if you follow the reading of it if you follow the context of it Hallelujah and other statements that brother Ram made brother said Jesus will meet the 144,000 in the the the millennial Temple Hallelujah that's where he will meet them glory to God that's why it don't make sense Hallelujah the millennial Temple is some person how's Jesus going to meet 144,000 people inside somebody my goodness hello somebody amen am well you see the that that Millennial Temple will be rebuilt hallelujah amen amen now notice in the message G's instructions to Daniel paragraph 118 he said John couldn't understand but then he looked he looked back and he saw on M Glory see the scripture here shows us he saw 144,000 that had not been defiled with women Jews that had not been defiled with women and brother R says churches yes sure amen amen so they had not been defiled with with church church he said they hadn't joined to organization of Lutheran Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian but they had been Jews from the beginning amen the Orthodox amen and had their Temple and they worshiping on Zion hallelujah amen amen so notice brother Revelations 14 is showing you that where these 144,000 are worshiping they're singing a song that no one else can sing but them Hallelujah they had the father's name on their forehead that means they already received the Revelation that was given to them it's the same Revelation that the bride Rees that seals her for him is the mighty Angel it's the holy spirit that comes sealing Hallelujah and that is under the seventh seal to the bride of Christ to the Jews amen the seven trumpet and they are sealed according to Revelations 11 they are sealed according to Revelation 7 they are sealed [Applause] Hallelujah and when they're seal then they can then they can be killed they cannot be killed until they're not sealed amen it's when they're sealed within the 3 years and a half amen hallelujah the slaugh comes but there will be a resurrection hallelujah amen in other words Revelations 14 is showing you that they are resurrected Hallelujah and they're worshiping Jesus in the millennial [Applause] Temple hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory that's why like I said you got to see how the word's being placed oh in Elijah is a s trumpet in mystery form amen that's why they're getting sealed three years and a half are over then the Wrath comes they're killed but after that they're resurrected it's in the same chapter 11 Hallelujah hu this is where there's there on Mount Z brother Rapture spiritually where we at we're on see because God deals with them literally they get killed literally hallelujah amen amen am Oh Glory to God you understand now hold on maybe that was a big state to begin but I I want you to get the picture what we're reading here Revelation 14 amen understand now look now look how how perfect this is this is beautiful remember remember that the seventh trumpet in mystery form is a same as the mystery SE the right listen what he says in the message unite in time and sign Revelations 10s paragraph 100 uniting time and S reation I 10 said the seventh Angel's message now that's right now remember that's right at the seven seven trumpets listen and there's seven angels blowing seven trumpets that's what we're coming to next but remember there very specifically it said the Angels not the seventh angel's trumpet about Revelations but the seventh Angel's message because the beginning of the paragraph again he says Revelations 10 said the seventh Angels message remember that's right at the seven trumpets there's seven angels blowing seven trumpets that's what we're coming to next but remember there very specifically said the Angels see but not he said not the seventh Angels Trumpet but the seventh Angel's message see not the tret Angel but the message Angel the the angel only sounded the trumpet the seventh that seventh angel the trumpet angel was this that in the days of the V the in the days of the message of the seventh Church when his message is finished see that's the church age message see the message not the trumpet the mystery of God that's written in the word would be finished see what he's talking about so he's talking about the message being given in Revelations 10 and he's talking about that there's a seventh angel amen that sounds the trumpet and he's he's making a distinction between the trumpet angel and the message Angel he's making a distinction between Revelations 10:7 and Revelations 1115 amen amen amen amen revelation 10:7 is the message Angel and Revelations 11:15 is the trumpet angel what do he Revelations 11:15 say the seventh angel sounds his trumpet amen and there's voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ that's The Mystery of the seven trumpet to God hallelujah hallelujah in other words it's declaring amen the millennial Reign when the kingdoms of this world Daniel's Vision the kingdoms are smitten amen and then the fifth Kingdom amen the kingdom of our Lord and his Christ is EST on the earth Hallelujah that's the seventh trumpet that's the mystery of the S trumpet is that right how many know that when brother was caught in the cloud how many AG was up here six seven not six seven and the seventh angel that was preaching the message where was he he was on the earth is that right and he was caught up into the cloud of seven angels hlu I hope you understand what I'm saying [Music] he in other words who was this down here this was the angel with the message preaching amen he was Revelations 10:7 you understand but when he went up there he met seven angels Hallelujah and the seventh angel up there was the seventh trumpet amen and you know what brother said he said he's the one with the seven seal hallelujah hallelujah amen was there seven angels in the cloud was there seven angels in the cloud then who was this one that was on the Earth was he Revelations 107 you see what I'm saying and when he was caught up he met seven angels He didn't meet six amen amen hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory remember what the Seven Angels were we preached about it didn't we preach ministering Spirits s for the presence of God didn't we preach what these seven angels are when they come together here is the fullness of the pillar of fire hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's the angel of the Lord hallelujah amen you got to understand brother Revelation 107 is a messenger the man on the earth amen but he was caught up to meet seven angels in the and them seven angels is the same seven angels amen that trumpet hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] GL am to God when when did these seven trumpets begin to blow haven't we been studying this they began to blow Amen in the second world war to force Israel back right these angels began to blow the trumpets is that right but brother Paul had been in the sixth dimension for how many years amen amen see what I'm saying amen oh my and it wasn't it wasn't Paul going in his theop form to blow this trumpet sir remember when we preach on on on the ministering spirits and the angel of the Lord the mystery of Christ as the angel of the Lord I remember that amen how many know how many remembers brother explaining his experience going beyond the curtain of time yeah right M what did he say he says I looked down there I saw my body what did he go into what did he go into his theh is that right he went into his theop every everybody came and hugging him he says I touched my head and I had hair everybody look young amen amen it was the same William not a different when brother youry amen doesn't look different than you it's you in a in a Eternal youth State Hallelujah is that right in other words I ain't going to go my theop amen my theop is going to

and 20 21 right right in there but when he went and he saw the seven I'm trying to make a point when he when he went up and he saw the seven angels He said this one had pointed back amen amen Wings hallelujah amen he said the seventh one the one that be me to me the one with the seventh seal hallelujah hallelujah God you understand listen he said the seven angels the seven trumpets not the trumpet angel the message Angel see not the trumpet angel the message Angel Revelation hallelujah hallelujah the one with the seven seal so it shows that the same one that blows the seven trumpet it's a one that had the seven seal amen amen amen so that's why the seven trumpet going to the Jews is the same as the seven seal to the Gentiles because that angel Hallelujah come down amen and he gave that seven seal mystery to a prophet on the earth and that Prophet on the earth a man Hallelujah began to preach seven seal mystery you understand and what is that seventh angel that blows seven trumpets that blows that trumpet amen what is he going to do G to God he's going to send it down Elijah Hallelujah and Mes in Elijah are going to be preaching the mystery of the seven Hallelujah call

earth amen and the prophet on the earth took that mystery and preached that mystery Hallelujah and that called your name called my name they called the bride's name hallelujah hallelujah and that's angel will come according to Revelations 11 he gives his message to Moses Hallelujah Andes and is the seven trumpet in mystery for preaching the message for 144,000 hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you see it say Amen remember brother Ram said in the message of revelation of Jesus Christ he said this same Little Women little woman amen when I walked into the Tabernacle inport inport that we were in the life Tabernacle the Holy Spirit moved on that woman and said word for word what the what he said to me up on the hill then the spirit begin to move begin to give interpretation for telling things I Revelation I prophecy the things that would happen in the meeting the following night and not one time that it fell but before that a little woman stood up in the meeting a Baptist woman came over there and knew know not not knowing what she could do she was standing in the midst of a meeting where the Holy Spirit fell on her and she began to speak with tongues a back woman from the First Baptist Church at treport she didn't know what she had done before she could say anything the Holy Spirit gave the interpretation and said thus sayith the Lord within three months there will be the

I'm well pleased hear ye him when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid listen and Jesus came and touched them and said arise Be not Afraid re and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man said Jesus only and they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why didn't say this scribes that Elias must first come now how many know that the Jews were waiting amen amen for the coming of the Lord amen amen but they were waiting for him in the
