TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh hallelujah hallelujah in the true Easter seal 1965 brother said that mother eag that crosses the Earth crying and looking for his children he said it's only calling for the elected don't you understand that that very parable of brother of the little e Eagle egg in the chicken C is a parable of the predestinated seed we were supposed to be born upon Eagle Mountain we were supposed to be born where eagles are born in the but we by and we come down to a chicken under mother amen and we thought we were chicken we thought we were ordinary human beings like everyone else on the earth let me tell you the BR is a super race she has characteristics that no one else has sheut that no one else has hallelujah hallelujah Angel hallu Hallelujah hallu she has prophetic perception that no one else has she has toil of receiving Revelation because she come from the father and she's going back to theah amen amen hallelujah the thing about it is brother the elected bride of Christ is a special class not just ordinary people they say your regular serpent seed amen this ordinary tribulation S no these are these are souls that were in God in eternity they never had a beginning amen amen they byass the we were supposed to come in into our theop just like Jesus before coming to flesh but we didn't Jesus did amen he was the word before coming to flesh we are becoming the word you see the difference now listen he say it's not promised that Sinners has Angels that's strong brother is that I'm with the prophet 1964 questions and answers so just to Cle the nail the Sinners have Angels see see how that see how that makes it like kind to wake up a little bit Hallelujah then you then you recognize when when brother Ram said you heard from your the when when you heard from this message when you heard the mother cry brother Adam is telling you you heard that you're hearing from your representation you know why because that's the word and your theop is the word amen let me ask you something where did thees come from amen amen they come from the Eternal attribute of Christ they come from him because from the invisible when he Express the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen that word was the is that right that was the pillar of fire called it in questions and answers the fullness of the attributes of God and from that P of Fire from that theop of Christ come the rest of the the yes so if that was the word amen and brother is saying who is this mopy is a word form body amen the the theop is the word seejah now brother listen to what he says next but look he says it clearly it makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning you hear what he just said let me read it again you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning you you can't come in to a word body unless you were a thought that proves predestination of God what what destination is he talking about see you can't be the word unless you were a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the you have to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin then if you stand all the father has given me he's qu to Jesus all the father has given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the last days see you had to be first Hallelujah you had to be an Express thought you had to be an original of God and that's only the bride hallelujah hallelujah that's Redemption that's redeemable that's whose names were in the land's Book of Life the foundation of the world the Son of God for Jo Hall we were there we saw the Plan of Redemption we seen the whole thing unfold Hallelujah we recognize that that form of fire ofc would come and redeem us back to God so you can't be a word body unless you were a thought in and a word body is a theen then he says when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body into subjection to God hallelujah hallelujah then he then he says he that is born of God does not commit sin and then he says Romans 81 there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ amen walk not after the flesh walk after the spirit now brother let me ask you something who truly receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost read the message although there's some preachers in this message that teach that I don't know where they get it from read the message he tells you very clearly they cannot receive it amen amen is that true the only ones that can receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul is bride there's no yes amen that's the only ones brother and there's a reason why this is this is deep now this is going to confirm again what we were saying this morning there's a reason why only the bride receives the holy ghost in the soul Amen brother said the rest that doesn't have an attribute of God that was in God in the beginning if they don't have that brother said the Holy Ghost can fall on them every minute of their life and nothing happens in their they're under the baptism is falling on them the anointing is there but nothing's happening in here Hallelujah but you put a redeemable attribute that hallelujah hallelujah why because there's something on the inside Hallelujah that's connected with that Holy Ghost it was with it in the beginning down look the spirit The Immortal Life inside of you throws this body into subjection to the word brother we we don't realize how tremendous this is see what why why this is proving to you as a Believer who you are and if you're going in the Raptor why is there so much fear today brother I don't believe God brought me into this message to go to the tribulation yes sir no no if God would have wanted me to go to the he left me somewhere else but he brought me to this word for hallelujah amen didn't bring you this message Amen to throw me in the tribulation he brought me away he brought me way go back came Hallelujah this message is real this message is eternal Al when you hear from this message you hear from your on If you're receiving this message in your soul and something is quickening you it's telling you you have a theop in the six Dimension come on Brother come on maybe I imagine I imagine that I have a the same imagination this is brother amen imagination amen but fa the from God huah Hallelujah to be afraid of Great Tribulation supposed to be afraid oh uh the government all the persecution we have a promise when that what you see what he that's why cannot imp am brother tell me if the third pool is Angels then how come only the bride can enter into that if everybody else amen can be ministered by these angels is the third Four Angels that's what he said amen remember the vision said the first flight was the first pool little bitt birds he said that's when I was praying for the people second pool it was bigger brighter white he to the heart uhhuh he said the third flag was Angels what kind of angels questions and ansers on the seals when he was there said something's happening here there's voices there's Angel all around he says if you can catch yes amen and sister only the angel that can minister to a soul on Earth is because there's a connection yes to the bride of Christ no elseu now you have to understand that when I say it like that I'm not being Prejudice towards foolish virgin towards Jews none of that it's only proving word of God where the bride stands who she is by predestination amen it's not you know downplaying foolish virgin saying oh it's not that going to have they're going to receive eternal life at the second Resurrection they'll be outside of the city amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah you see people but they can not receive the quickening power of the spirit that comes to the soul to Quicken it that's right brother that's true cannot amen they cannot look at this the spirit of God Immortal Life inside of you throws his body in subjection to God and he goes to to to to you know him that is born of God cannot sin then uh Romans 81 no condemnation to then walk after the spirit not after the flesh then he says what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started then he says it was one subject to sin and M corruption but now it's has got the earnest the earnest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Soul being Quicken that's the ear but because it's got that it's already started he says amen where am I at because it's already started it was one subject to sin mind corruption but now it's got ear listen what he says the body this one it's turned Heavenly yes now that's the ear that you're going in theu if that is happen what is God telling you the fire baptism coming into your soul is quickening me for the rallu amen there's no you receive the Holy Ghost and then you'll make a mistake and because you were in that mistake have your way Lord thank you it's not so if you're in a mistake the Rapture won't come until you get it right take that hallelujah hallelujah it's not that you'll go into a mistake and then the rap come you'll be left behind no no no no he don't save you now to lose you tomorrow don't run business like that that already started in your soul the that you are going hall hallelujah it's already started hallelujah it's already been quickened how do I know it because this word has been open inside of my soul and the Holy Ghost it's revealing word upon word brother said devil can impersonate speaking in Tong he can imperson s he can imperson sh anding in the spirit but he cannot the word word by word he cannot believe the he cannot receive the word he's not part of the word Hall but afterday by the grace of almighty God with my failures with my mistakes somehow God makes a way that he brings Revelation into my soul H Hallelujah when that word comes into the soul brother it begins to hold to things that your mind even your mind tell you know because this because that because that something deep down ins says yes I believe that yes sir if you stay like that then later on the Revelation come yes and then all those doubts and all those no and all those fears when that Revelation comes because there was something here to begin with when that revation comes amen it says okay okay here I go amen then another doubt comes says no but this this and then another Revelation comes here you go taking place inside of you that's happening the Lord's speaking to you right now if that's happening Hallelujah that's not what you're supposed to beise Lord he's working on the ins Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh hallelujah hallelujah there's something in there brother that is pulsating in it's whole it's whole hunger all it own thirst it'sing for the word word that's what the holy GH yes the mind the flesh will go after other things but the soul wants pure re Lord re rations it starts to get into desperation to like David I cry like the oh myuj like the dear for the water BRS so my soul after the the Living God I want the Living Word these Creeds these dogas these manmade preacher interpretation Satisfy My Soul if a preacher that claims and believe this message come up some silly idea amen and he tries to make the message say something that it doesn't say here doesn't accept that's right that's here this here say that's right word come on Brother come on something on the inside that only wants the word only want only come on brother word brought in death and separated us it'll take every word to take us back every word that proth out of the come on brother amen come on hallelujah hallelujah believe that okay yes sir so that's the ear that we're going in the rap you see that's the earnest he's already he's already paid the price amen amen glory now look said I wanted to be sure amen have your way Lord have your way so not promis to have angs questions answers two he says here a sinner if you you're not only condemnation now not here no you'll Prosper you go on that's all through the mercies of God that's all through the mercies of God you will prosper and you will do what you do that's true but one of these days if you're a sinner and your soul slips out it'll go out yonder into judgment and be condemned then you'll be Cast Away you'll be in torment until the day that you are brought back to this Earth again see he's showing you again there's another quote brother said I believe Satan's e or one of those messages in 65 I've quoted that before here brother says great white Throne judgment is here on the earth amen am after the Millennium Mill after the battle but now look at this this he says cuz this is speaking of the second Resurrection amen he says you'll be brought back to this Earth again you will receive's talking about a sinner you will receive an immortal body a s but when does he receive a body when he goes to h when he comes to the judg after he's judged you see how it's proving this you will receive an immortal body inmortal body that cannot die now now you have to take this because he he's not saying all together that that Immortal bodies is going to live Eternal he's talking about a sinner that's going to go to hell but he is making emphasis that that person after he's judged is going to receive a body Amen to go this he says you will receive an immortal body an immortal body that cannot die and will be Cast Away into outer Darkness where there will be weeping wailing and nashing of teeth you'll be cast into hell where the worm Never Dies for the fire is never cring you'll be tormented through all the ages there is to come Jesus said that that's a black picture but that's what the Bible say if God so condemn sin that it cost such a price what will it be to those unjust Spirits could ever be made loose again we' have another thing like we had the last 6,000 years is that right there'll never be an opportunity again again when when you go to the Grave see your body goes to hell hell means separation death means separation your body dies separates you go from your loved ones here but that's not what we're talking about it's once appointed unto man to die and after that the Judgment yes now if you stand at the Judgment of God and you're going to be judged by an Angry God and God is going has already pronounced what he's going to do so you know what your judgment will be before you even get there is that right the ones that are going to be torment they already know what they judgment see and he says before they get there so the thing to do is to be saved and have this glorified being now look he says look we're not something dead we're alive and he says amen all right he says I'm going jump down here he says how quick that God knows every thought that we think of everything that we do he knows of so when the believer dies he goes into the presence of his maker his God When The Sinner dies he goes into his destination now I'm talking now of the elect but there's some of them that will come up in the second resurrection that will have to stand in the Judgment with the sinner to be judged with him I want to be sure to get that first that will take place the will be the coming of the Bride amen there will be people in the world you might differ a little with this but listen close just because you accepted Christ as your personal savior doesn't mean you're going in the r just because you accepted Christ as your personal savior does it mean you're going in the Rapture is that right Hallelujah that's for the elect that will go in the rap there will be a Remnant left here on Earth that will go to the persecution and the Great Tribulation the church will be caught up in the R so just because people accept Christ as their savior amen amen and they believe that they stay with that and they give their life for that does it mean that they're going in the r it has to be more than that Amen in this age brother to be bride and qualified amen it's Perfection amen amen hallelujah you just had to be justified and you were sealed as bride they're coming up in the resurrection as bride the on that truly receive justification for amen those that truly receive sanctification for their day they were sealed until the day of their redemption in the days of w they'll come up in the resurrection amen that's with Wesley they'll come up amen Pentecostals that receive the restoration of the gifts Street amen and they were sealed under the Pentecostal message they will come up in the resurrection Hallelujah huj as Bride for that age but brother you cannot go in as bride today just with justification just with gifts of the Spirit it's something moreall glory to God and the full seing of God in this hour it's that quickening power in the soul to bring you back to a full revelation of who you where you come from who you are amen you're angel coming to you ministering to you the word you're hearing from your the you know you're going in the rap there's no more doubts there's no more fears you know exactly who you are there's a difference Saints of other ages they still have doubts they didn't know maybe it's this maybe it's that maybe I can still maybe I can still father ghost amen maybe all I need to do is just speak in tongues you see that's good brother not now brother you can't have none of that in confusion like that you have to have St yes sir see now listen to this I want to hit something here oh glory huj amen am the word yes does these things prove to you then about the Angels amen and who they minister to who they are so if the angel your representation is to the elected only is because when you receive baptism of fire in this age according to the prophet of God in the message the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he says this oh Hallelujah this is deep and listen it I want to I want to get straight to a point here he's talking about the future home he's talking about he's talking about the little woman at the well she had it says the little woman had nothing to present she was filthy dirty as she could be but way down in her she got representation what has representation let me say one more thing that come to me right now how many read or heard the message St of per brother says listen close go back and search it out in that message brother says that one that man that perfect man that stat of a perfect man is the one going the that's what he said okay now what man is he talking about is he talking about a Mexican man Brown Man black man Asian man white man what man is he talking about word man he's not talking about a Mexican you're not talking about a black man no no that's not that's not the statue of perfect amen amen don't get offended because I said I'm mexan but he's not talking about Mexican no he's not no Mexicans ain't going in going I'm I'm saying it like that so you can realize who he's talking about amen white people ain't going in the RT ain't going in the RT who's that man that's going in the r the soul if you understood what I just said then you'll understand that the St of perect man not the flesh you understand and you quit looking at this C brother said don't never think that your body is weak yes yep only the we in the no C CER is Mexican black Asian that's C amen amen but the wheat but is the SW thing this a this ain't nothing but corruption oh yes this is perversion oh no brother but if this body is so holy then why is it the air sometimes wow that's good point amen amen hallelujah oh the air no one be close to you hallelujah oh my hallelujah amen that's right corruption and death is in your body what did the scripture say no you're not blood canot inherit the Kingdom am when Jesus rose from the dead he told Thomas touch me and see if I'm not Flesh and Bones yes not blood search the scure glorify no brother that flesh that that Thomas touched went through a w Hallelujah this Mortal shall put on immortality this corruption glorified that's why he told his wife we're not americ do come on hallah we're citizens of another kingdom Hallelujah this is just a temp body that that that we're in for for these these years that we've been on the earth it's temporal this is not who we are the real you inside Hallelujah come on brother keep going come on look what he says future home he said now you become a new person amen not just the old one patched up by joining the church by turning the new page no no no you become a brand new complete unit God takes the old man and burns him out completely with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself and what does he do what does he do when he when he when he baptized you with the Holy what does he do brother let me tell you something only those who see the back fire soul soul they beer because when you receive with fire your theh is there said and when you receive the Holy Ghost God injects into your soul a supernatural life the size of a fingernail size of a button where does that light come from your theop brother is Body Of Life word hallelujah it's part of the L of God it's part of the pillar of fire you believe that you get baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire that it comes from the pillar of fire else does it come from he said he comes but here on Earth when the moment comes for you to be quickened in the soul to Quicken that that's why I said this morning there's a veil between this eternal and that Eternal and that's the body but once that Veil is taken away brother this has to become subject to the word because now you have an influence in amen giving you the word ministering to you the word and unconscious we're being anointed by that brother was a man that lived in this knowledge he knew exactly that this Angel was always with Hallelujah he knew exactly how to operate amen he knew exactly what this was and he says he comes the spirit of God Christ comes and he gives what he said Hallelujah hallu orinary thing something was taking place in this man's something taking this man something was taking place in this man's Soul he was the first one of the super race amen someone brother that's not normal someone that's connected with two worlds hallelujah amen that's right someone that has a knowledge what the father wants him to do and the bride will have the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with word hallelujah super walking under the channel of inspiration being influenced by minist when they come to minister when they minister to the Saints they don't Minister theology that brother they Minister man's interpretation they don't say well I believe it's this I believe it's that they come with usly because that's the mind of Christ that knows Hallelujah they got to ask is this right is this okay oh brother it's pure come on brother I realized one day that there was another William BR a little spot of eternal life down in there the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working something inside was work he says one of these then one day as I walk on that voice talking said don't never Smoke Drink and the young fellows and all got older and there was something moving but yet all at once and I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles am amen hallelujah amuah Char are the parents of Flesh body William Liv but he come to the realization I'm not the son of Charles there's something calling like my little Eagle see what heing about I'm not a che there's something up y somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home he says I was Bor again hallelujah hallelujah without that in the there's no fire baptism then I was born again a little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow that old life was forgiven put in the see of forgetfulness God's forgetfulness never to be remembered against me no more Hallelujah now we stand Justified as we have never SE the of God hallelujah brother when that soul and that attribute was Quicken and it takes control brother gram said your name your name is transer Book of Life youred strong the first husband has to dieen for you to with Christ the first nature the old man has to die so that the new man is that right this didn't go like I thought but all right brother bam said in the message identified Christ of all ages we're still in the negative like taking a picture of something and you're snapping it God says he'll have dark hair he'll have blue eyes and so forth he'll be this he'll be this he'll be like this there's there's a lot of quotes brother says before the foundation of the world God knew my makeup how I was going to be my form my face everything he already knew you know that in thean church brother quotes Psalms 139 vers 15 and 16 where he is he is proving that out of our being physical was in God's thoughts at the beginning and this is where David said my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously rocked in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in th book were all my members Hallelujah when in in in which in countenance were fashion when as yet there was none of them hallelu there was not even one part of our human body on the earth and God already had picture in his mind but then there come a time amen amen when the L was expressed from that come for Len to me of the amen and that theing is the image of you imperfection brother went beyond the curtain of time none of those people's bodies were there with is that right did he see his daughter Shar rose rose was she a little baby like when she died she was a young girl that little baby body the dust was down in the Earth amen Amen brother we weren't supposed to come babies Adam didn't come a baby didn't come a baby they come full St amen that's the picture of God of you look what he says he says he know you have dark hair blue eyes and so forth the picture snapped the age of about 20 years old this says identified Christ of all the ages he says then death sets in and you start dying no matter no matter how much you eat how well you put food back into your body there's not scientist in the world that can explain it and then he goes on I want to go down here and he says but God has an appointment and man must die and face the judgment and you're going to keep the the I'm sorry the appointment friends while we're here tonight we want to remember those things that we've got to meet that appointment there might be many you'll stand up and get away from but that's one we're sure everyone to meet now in that appointment that God has made with man this body must because it is yet negative it's subject to death so brother B calls this body the negative amen so there has to be another body which is the positive amen amen he so he gets the eternal spirit he his attribute displayed in that body then like any picture it's in negative form what happened when a picture's in negative form of course brother talking about in his day right because now you got digital and and all this right he talking about negative pictures in his day right what do they have to do right they had to do what the negative that goes into a dark room negative goes into a dark room there it's developed it comes out to the perfect picture picture in eternity he took the picture of the real living image of his who you were going to be for all eternity you took a picture of that but the negative amen amen is put in a dark room this is thetive all of these 30 years 29 years 30 years amen it's been in a amen amen one of these days glory to God the full picture of the positive is going to come for amen amen and that one ain't like the one you see now Hallelujah that one Hallelujah Hallelujah that one amen can go through a wall Oh Glory that one can fall over a sword and it won't harm over a wall That's why brother said could it be that this is coming that this is going to be revealed could this be what time is it Serv will this be the time that he'll change these corrupt Hallelujah he says will says that a mighty marching Army that they'll leap over wall an army never been the Bible says they can fall on sword it won't harm them he says before them is a Garden of Eden behind is a desolate desert Hallelujah who can stand before this Army and the Bible says and the Lord utters his voice before his arm hallelujah hallelujah the trumpet Bloom from the lion roars from Hallelujah brother and S what is this in this amen your feet look at this brother Hallelujah
