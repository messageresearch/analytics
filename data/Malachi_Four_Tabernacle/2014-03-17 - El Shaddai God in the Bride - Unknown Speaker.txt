what he says but look at he said what was the holy ghost given before he says paragraph 74 say the holy ghost foreign first thessalonians no but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel and so we speak not as pleasing men but god which tries our hearts for neither at any time use we flattering words as you know nor cloak covetousness god is witness no our men sought with glory neither of you nor yet of others then we might have been burdened some as the apostles of christ we're gentle among you even as a nurse cherish the one that gives nurse amen okay amen so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted into you not the gospel of god only but also of our own souls because we were ye were dear unto us a even as a nurse and they hallelujah

word is because when you become part of the world anointed punctuate that's what i want to church of this hour then we become god's words as long as you're in christ then you are in the fullness of the bible as long as you are in christ this is questions and answers then you are in the flawless of the bible because he again won that position she's in christ fullness of the bible brother you
