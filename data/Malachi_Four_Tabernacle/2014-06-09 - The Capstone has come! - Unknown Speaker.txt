amen amen to look at the history when messages being fulfilled words you see okay like we were saying this morning brother they were predestinated of God we raised up in commissioned in that opportunity to do that work but I said it's over look at Ezra chapter six verse 50. because we're 6 15. exactly and this house was finished this is the rebuild yes which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king yes and the children of Israel the priests in the election versus kept the dedication of this house of God with joy of israelitas and after that the dedication of this house of God a hundred Bullocks 200 Grand foreign devices amen amen did they read anointed and it was finished he's going to read that in the scripture if you really want to get death amen right the last time to rule about the dementia was in chapter five of it because that's what we mentioned amen okay verse 27 verse 87. as a dedication of the wall of the place out of all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with Blackness so for Thanksgiving and with singing with symbols solid foods and results foreign and the songs for verse 43 Verse also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoice the God has made them Rejoice with great joy who was also in children Rejoice so that the joy of Jerusalem deserved even of far off is and the finishing of the wall and at that time where someone pointed over the chambers for the treasures for the alfreds for the first fruits the tides together into out of the fields of the Cities the portions of the law the preaching Levites for jewelry joints for the priests and for the Levites that waited foreign foreign and ask Ed although there were they were chief of the Sabers and songs of Praises Hallelujah Thanksgiving

God amen amen how many sitting on a hot seat tonight you know amen he told us of his experience of him being pushed to the corner and the strips amen but you see right at the coming of the Headstones that the the Cornerstone had already been believed yes the Cornerstone had been made right I was in the Cornerstone type yes December of 62. in 63 February I don't care what anybody says he was caught up into a cloud that's what he said amen a Ministry of the world why brother and sister animal when we see that Vindication amen amen God's word for you in this name is oh yeah foreign you have to be baptized that's right yes sir that's right but now that is what Luke's the only movement you understand yes brother the Holy Ghost spectacular they wonder about these words yes sir amen it's after the

Jordan zachariah's name is the Lord remembers Hallelujah foreign amen amen it's only those who are elected Jesus said I thank you Father father now inspiration they're very inspiration strikes then it is shown and business is more style so shall it be at the coming of the son I mean see right what is revealed is a secret made known a revelation is to reveal or to make known as secrets with inspiration fell upon Nehemiah he took that inspiration and he began to do something we begin to fulfill the prophecya that was that the angel came to death the war will be built in Troublesome times what the inspiration is we have to retain that Inspirations yes you understand and then there is not just to get into The Inspirations oh no amen amen brother and sister we should know already god what the inspiration is foreign so what is it foreign amen everyone has their pleasure but when the inspiration is being given to us we ought to realize this is part of the Fulfillment of the words we see the opposition taking place have you heard brother Gabriel's testimony he had told me that is amen you think that's a coincidence the lady said he was born and he asked law to give him a scripture the reason he told me that is because I was telling him brother and sister we are seeing our names foreign foreign foreign amen amen but right when we look at this he alive amen after the prophecy of Daniel again I was given years stop this work any opposition that comes against you okay will not go too far amen that's the reason why we must realize things foreign foreign but the thing is we've got to realize whether look at the words that's what's happening amen hallelujah these things aren't here brother and sisters and we're under the inspiration he's talking about you want to hear some of those prophecies and answers number one 1964. he says the other day I'm not mixed up I'm happy to hear it we're not mixed up he's talking about when we preach please I'll probably hear from him when I was talking about the seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal please to pass over to Pentacles is see that it should be because if I say the seventh month after that was brought in the streets of the trumpets which meant the seven churches if you listen to Future trumpets seven sabbaths and seven churches he says it's seven months see but now I didn't explain it on this brigade I said seven seven but then I carry that same spot when it's the seventh month after the Feast of Passover or or the three Supreme Court they come after the Feast of the Sheaf you remember the sheath turns into a loaf amen once it was a Sheaf and it all goes into one Loop he says oh it's a great teacher I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that is on your teeth and so say remember regardless and look in the Bible in seven months after that count off seven months what they said the message which represents full seven churches some Minister a woman might pick that up and then you'll have it thank you According to some there's nothing for ministers to do now brother oh my God Minister might pick that up and then you'll have it thank you amen amen now someday I'm going to leave here questions and answers on Hebrews 1957. Someday I'm gonna leave here and I'm wondering what will be my end yes is it just about I'm 48 years old I wonder if it is why didn't the world why did they realize that picture there is why didn't they catch that right quick why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies they can't do it now yes they can't do it now but one day when they are going to leave the world when I leave recognize will realize that after I'm gone that's what God wanted permitted to be done now remember amen yes but we got to get under inspiration Nehemiah got under the inspiration yes amen is and after my going away from this Earth many of you young children that is exactly the truth amen amen
