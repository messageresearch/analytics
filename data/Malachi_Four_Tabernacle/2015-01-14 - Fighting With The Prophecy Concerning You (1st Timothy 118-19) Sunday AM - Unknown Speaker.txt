========================================
on the other side and there was a valley between them you know is a little bit of Battleground where both forces of God and the Devils can meet in fact amen amen and right here in the shadow in the Old Testament here in the story of David he was the Bible speaks of the valley of decisions that's exactly where the battle is because that's he said is where decisions are made remember last Sunday we spoke about the pressure I believe it's the devil the enemy that presses down to make us be in that state of pressure to make the wrong decision is because when you're in that state you do things you wouldn't normally do because where and there without a champion out of the capital of philistine named Goliath the god of God whose height was six cubits in the spine is upon his head and he was almost voted now and waiting on the coat was 5000 shoes of Brass Bridge upon his legs and talking to friends between the shoulders the staff of the spirit was like a Weaver's being an experienced head weighed 600 seconds of iron and one pairing a shield went before it Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid I've noticed the scene here we read first Timothy amen how many understands why we read first Timothy okay verses 18 to 20. amen war of good Warfare amen amen find a good fight with by the prophecies that have been spoken except that upon you foreign foreign that is yeah he was led by the spirit amen amen and brother Adam says Jesse had a part of mind he put his eldest son it was the last week and he said surely this one will be here amen amen the crowd will look nice on him Hallelujah man but God told Samuel I don't look at the outward appearance God always testified he was a man a little bit after his own thoughts that's right he was anointed

rejecting you later hmm this is why we have to realize that if we are living in this time in this hour here was free plan I mean every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned because I don't understand everything was all pre-planned by God what infinite means there's nothing out of care foreign yes sir all right now we plan for many generations neither did you know him through very proud of his mother through the only one you become a person expressed in the image like your father you're knocking everybody where is your fellowship it's you have eternal life there's only one problem spiritual life yes you are nothing but the manifestations Tracy woman wherever you are look at this ass God knew you would be here yes because you have to be the water comes to Expressions not only

supposed to say that they say but brother Adams said help us that's different amen let's face it brother we all want to go sure when John saw his name in the book is he wrote he said come Lord Jesus Hallelujah amen oh that's good amen but the thing is we've got to meet the challenge he says he does it the same way every time about the same message he has to take Believers now listen close all right so listen up he says in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate to that age he's got to predestinate this thing to be there it's okay to meet the challenge foreign it

wait yes if you have faith you're gonna say in your in this word that's a powerful statement yes yes if you can believe it the question and take it for you that's a powerful statement amen amen

of God even if you're manifested power of God to me the challenge to me the challenge I am the truth and living God a message that is coming foreign that is coming foreign foreign computer keep this

forth fruits as your commission was let not this word depart from your mouth foreign but the members are weakness they love the things of the world better than they do these things you say oh look upon the church and find out don't try to deny it your action speaks more louder than your word does oh yeah we're members but where is the strength your won't meet the challenge of this house to take the church out of this thing foreign amen so brother and sister you have seen now and when we started yeah all these things that we've read what is that I've read about five six seven books already of

you're the one amen I'm the one you're sorry you gotta believe it you got a confession you are already a king and a priests amen amen foreign if it's Diamond it says I mean means the boundaries of the blood amen the boundaries facilities of the blood that are hungry Lord amen amen in this place the boundaries around it is where the battle was chosen to be fought does that means is within those boundaries not outside of the boundary foreign that's where you come to challenge but I thought that if the stamen in the face I mean the boundary of blood a limited but deep down in this Valley in the decision and a decision in your mind to see if you believe but let's look rest or you allow the enemy we're asking an illegal to put doubts there and say you have a son of God you have too much mistakes Hallelujah amen what it was as long as he stays same with the words but they had gotten outside of the world they couldn't meet the challenge brother remember when you're not in the boundaries of the blood you're afraid to face the devil yeah amen yeah you're afraid the devil just gonna tell you straight out you know because we're casting out Devils oh watch out and one brother how do you remember that time when you're not in the boundaries yes facing Hallelujah man another thing he said to see how much you can last in the background he said it's the thing is to get him as

and we've read that one a lot is the blood of Christ but another place is amen don't worry let's let's read here verse 12 verse now David was the son of that if Judah Hallelujah whose name was Jesse he had aches a man that went among them for an old man in the days of Saul is was the youngest everybody is the David winner returns from Saul to see his father's sheep at Bethlehem the handle is and

'' right yeah then send David to the Philistine now comes to be with the sword with the spirit and a shield when I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defiled it is Hallelujah he knew who he was yeah man he says he didn't go down there because amen that he was some kind of tough regarding Goliath yeah let me let me say this think of this yes what kind of free thank you for the face could David walk around with until he becomes before you think somebody can kill him just stand away no oh you think he's afraid that somebody can kill him and he ain't in that position thank you foreign amen you're confidential in the process I'm in you believe that okay David notice what he does he said okay immediately immediately when he faces a challenge this is a secret this is foreign Alberto Hallelujah I mean as you begin to counter attack the words ain't nobody facing the challenge he said how come you ain't out there and you want to put your armor on me that's what it means you should put it on you and go fight I don't want your arms amen and brother you see unless he didn't even have to smoke foreign because Hallelujah God videos

about his denominational brothers first 42 says he said that when the Goliath seen him and the Philistines seeing him what did he says he disdained him amen he despised Ministry so the fact the little that little David was coming up to challenges amen amen amen you know the devil does that says you understand forget it why did you do that so that you can lose confidence so that you can lose Faith but David knew he was anointed regardless of how little he was how many knows that David is a type of Christ that David's the top of brother how many knows that David listen okay okay yes to the local church that when Santa took the Horn of oil and he poured it on he did pour it it was wrong he took the whole home Hallelujah and see they look down on the little missions that's the message then he

California now you say brother but Simon didn't have seven horns he only had one that's exactly right because brother and sisters it all leaves it's pouring down on the Turks today uh foreign and
