every tree that is fled to the side even for food the tree of life also the midst of the garden the tree of knowledge of good and evil a river went out of eden to water the garden and from this it was therefore is then we find the way out of this part of the tree the knowledge then the curse comes to fall down from the surface from the man to the woman amen and when he comes to the man curses the serpent he curses the woman when it comes to the man do you have brown on right now yes 89 is is somebody is governing hallelujah mean doesn't want to preach okay but it's got to open don't want a

true so far now the word most definitely sets forth before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god it was a plan of redemption in order this happened had to become flesh like i said first before god before god before god can save satan had to come through in amen but now jesus but jesus christ we are born when and yields it's fruit every month and brother ram says 24 elders its walls will be jasper and sardis no need of a candle more sunlight of on either they yield their food once a month which is 12 months in a year they render 12 matters of fruit every year as it goes by in other words restored you've got to give praise and worship hallelujah because the tree has leaves is they have to give me because revelation 22 says amen it will produce manner of fruit fruit and the leaves of the tree or from the healing oh is to claim his see you are seal he's no more mediator he's keen oh that's great man if you understand then get it just just receive it don't reason it let's

don't know and that you as part of the treaty can give worship 12 manner of fruit and that you as part of the tree you can be leaves of healing if i look around and see why did you colonize yourself why did you take sides why wasn't you big enough to look up here and know that i love whosoever wills your water supply when you begin to argue they begin to stick at one another you know it would have a is sadness somewhere if we can create don't never misinterpret what the prophet said he never said that we're to stop rejoicing he never said where to stop entering into those things he said if the mate is not here wait until the mate comes but if you don't believe it i believe here foreign i already seen brother brad i'm in video in the audience you know this yeah sure don't look like some
