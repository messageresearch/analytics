TRANSCRIPT
========================================
come to the Judgment as brother BR would say it many times he could not come to the Judgment because he's already judged in Jesus Christ they took our judgment and Paul said in Romans 8 there is no condemnation to them that walk after the spirit and not after the flesh because they have been quickened by the power of God inside of their soul bringing their their mortal bodies a quickening power that one day will change it hallelujah hallelujah here we recognize the same life the same power has resurrected us from a dead condition from death and sin and corruption in our soul and has brought our soul un life quickening power has brought to life what God had put in you before the foundation of the world you already had eternal life you already had joy in you you already had the thought of God in you you already had the Gen in you you already had the soul that come from God and that Soul was an eternal thought that come out of God in the beginning and that show in there was in dead condition Hallelujah the soul that sin that Soul shall die amen but you were born in sin sh iniquity brother Adam said your soul is the nature to your spirit and your spirit controls your body so therefore from the soul there was a nature that was controlling your spirit and your spirit was controlling your body for your soul was in a dead condition but yet like the body of Christ it was in the Tomb the body was in a dead condition but that body was the spoken word of God from the mouth of the Angel it was a creation it was a seed it was the blood of God that had come into Mary and produced a son and just as that is the soul of the bride of Christ and in that Soul was in a dead condition but in the Third Day Life came into that soul and when life come into the body of Christ there was a resurrection and when life comes into the soul of the believer there is a resurrection hallelujah hallelujah that's why he said he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sh me Adam said in the Easter seal he that heareth my word he said what does that mean he that understandeth his position in this hour hu has passed from Death life why because he has been brought to his position he was he was in death and sin but he has been brought to life when you're brought to life you're brought to your position when you're brought to life you're brought to where you always were supposed to be Hallelujah you weren't saved on a certain day you was always saved Hallelujah you just recognizing what you were supposed to be for the foundation of the world Satan did not stop God's plan cannot stop God's program no matter what he does no matter what he says no matter what he tries to do you cannot stop God's program for God will always Prevail above the enemy Hallelujah and then Jesus says verily verily I say to you verse 25 the hour is coming and now is how many times did Jesus say that he said it in the chapter before this chapter 4 he told the woman at the well the hour is coming and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father the spirit and Truth why brother teaches us that God's provided place of worship why was he saying that because the pillar of fire that was in the temple in Jerusalem behind the veil the holy of holies the sh Glory was no longer there it had lift up and it had gone to another Temple huj amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah when to come into another Temple turn temp hallelujah amen Jesus said the hour is coming and now is you will worship the father in Jerusalem amen M or in this mountain to worship the father in spirit and in truth thank you amen is that right hallelujah hallelujah and what he says the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice The Voice Hallelujah of the son of God Hallelujah hallu of the Son of God and they that hear shall and then look at verse 28 he says Marvel not at this verse 28 for the hour is coming and then he doesn't say and now is he just says the hour is coming amen did you get that amen am verse 25 he said the hour is coming and now is verse says Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evilto the resurrection of damnation he's speaking something that is coming in the future now in the white Throne judgment after the Millennium after everything amen then in that judgment there will be some or all of those who weren part of the first resurrection will raise in the second Resurrection to come before the white throne and some will be condemned and some will be brought to life amen is that right amen oh brother but let's not look too far down the road because of this what Jesus was speaking has a compound meaning to the power that was to come when judgment was going to be executed by the son of man Hallelujah and that execut of judgment Hallelujah was going to come to bring resurrection and Life to some and and Resurrection to show and expose some to damnation but show what they're made out of but show what see they are hallelujah hallelujah he brings them to a realization that they're they're cross they're damned in their denomination hallelujah amen they can no more come out because they've been AED in the ear this is what he shows there is some shown by the word in this hour by the message amen when the son of man begin to execute judgment when he come down from heaven to investigate hallelujah hallelujah in the first phase am he used the shout to bring a spiritual Resurrection is that right brother bam said it is the rising of the Sun what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is hallelujah hallelujah the one that was over there is what he said the voice of the Son of God Amen they that hear shall live and only is his powerful Only The Dead that were in God the Old Testament Rose from Matthew 28 right but then he speaks of something else coming when the son of man executes judgment all judgment is committed to the son when he come with the white wig you understand hallelujah hallelujah then he says there will be some that will resurrect un life there'll be some that done evil and resurrect unto damnation amen amen why are we saying this oh myuj because there's a great thing in here in what Jesus is saying and then we noticed that he begins to say John bear witness of me my Works bear witness of me my father bear witness of me the scriptures they witness of me hallelujah hallelujah what he said when he was talking about John he was a burning and Shining Light and you were willing amen you were willing Glory how many people in the message amen are willing to rejoice in that light glory to God that God sent a forerunner that God sent a messenger is that right amen amen to forun the second coming of Christ amen hallelujah amen yes sir people don't they fail to recognize the second coming Hallelujah huj is in Bride form oh my glory to God I didn't make this up brother the very messenger himself is GL they're willing to return in the light amen of the message for a season what season the season when it's not yet the season amen of Jesus to come and fulfill the word you see while it was the season of The Prophecy of the prophet they rejoiced in the life because that was the season when the prophecy was going forth and they rejoiced in that light for That season but when the season changed we're speaking about the Bride season in this hour then when the season changed hallelujah hallelujah and brother Ram said the works of God are to be made manifest glory to God that's the problem with many today still looking at the caral still looking at the flesh still looking at these things and they're wanting a healing Revival like first pool like second pool brother bam said at the end of his ministry but he was preaching the word I was going to bring the quote out but I didn't have time tonight said he said what he's preaching the word he said how many can accept revelation of the word as it's going forward AMU and the message influence and the message influence he said this that he stopped and he said there should be 300 people here at the altar there's only been one or two that has responded he says okay and then he drops back into second pool and he begins to discern your sister over there your address is such and such and such your address is such and such and such and then you begin to hear begin to scream they begin to get happy they they begin to Rejoice then they begin to come to the Altar and you know what brother bam says that's where you're dece said that's where you're dece why because he was trying to get them to respond to the word in the but they they wouldn't respond to they were they were so accustomed to only respond to the sign it's the same thing in the message today Hallelujah that's good M brother B said that's where you're deceived that's a powerful statement because he was trying to get the people to respond to the third po the opening of the word you hear your name you don't have to see the sign you don't have to see the sign in the head you don't have to see the address is such and such the word call hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's what we need today say oh brother you see how you want to operate in the third pool and you don't operate in the first or the second that's what you're de what was trying to bring the people to that phase oh my if this is too deep for you man all right Hallelujah this is the Bride season people are not not wanting to rejoice in this season because they are still trying to look for the sign they still want healing campaigns and healing revivals brother bam said that's over on tap he said that's over he said that was only to get your attention to the word he said God will still continue to heal the sick Mark 16 will still continue on but the healing Revival is over my brother and now you see look at the Pentecostal Church oh they're they're trying to figure out how was it back in those years in those healing revivals we want to have that and that's what the Pentecostal church is striving for to have healing campaign let them have them brother let them have it's all right the bride will stay with the word and in the word there's healing and in the word amen God heals cancer in the word god raises the dead in the word God heals all our infir amen hallelujah hallelujah noce here he Jesus is TR say those that are in the grave I hear the voice of the Son of God and they that here shall live now he then he said in verse 36 have greater witness hallelujah amen search the scriptures they are they that testify me now let us look brother mam said every generation every get a chance of an of a Revival a chance at the word in the seventh seal he said when the seals open it was all together to bring and call out a group of people in the spoken words you Original Seed he says again he said a Revival is when the word is quickened when the spirit is poured out upon the people to call them out Hallelujah that is the chance that a generation gets to either receive or reject what God is giving in that generation Hallelujah and when it's being given it this is what brother bam called a predestinated season hallelujah hallelujah a predestinated season glory and the SM Church age he says this Amen in the Blue Book glory amen hallelujah but to go on these elect were not only Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season in their due season but these same elect are called by another name then he goes into the scriptures Romans 4 Romans 9 3ans 3 then he goes on to say this notice he identified the seed with Christ and he counted the Sheep children as children of the promise promise having to do with the election now get this church the choosing of God the election of God that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God they are the predestinated they are the forn of God and they were in the mind of God and in his thoughts then he says in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated and decreed season as each member come forth it began expression expressed and it took place in the body the body of Christ thus this Bri is the literal spoken word she and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called for she was predestinated in him and come from the same Source you know like Eve from Adam then he says which was eternal with him and now manifesting God in a many membered body where as on God was manifested in one member our Lord Jesus Christ Christ he said in Christ is a mystery God revealed first the anointed man now the anointed people Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus come GL as the son of man and when he was in flesh human flesh glory to God that was the son of man is that right but when he died amen was buried and rose again he went back into a form that brother Ram said he was the son of God for seven Church ages the Son of God what Jesus just showed us something in St John 5 what did he show us he said the hour is coming and and now is the time that I'm going to die and I'm going to rise again in that form and in that form of the Son of God I raise the dead Hallelujah do you understand say Amen what form was Jesus in when he rose the dead was he in the form of the son of man or was he in the form of the son of God Son of God he himself said it oh my but then he said the hour is coming amen and he didn't say and now is but the hour is coming when those are in the grave amen shall come forth some Amen to life and Resurrection glory and some to damnation what is that brother when he come in the form of the son of man in this hour through the ministry of the prophet of God he was revealed as son of man and that son of man revealing himself was not the seventh angel it was Elohim in a man ring God now notice that when he come brother he began to bring a word a message a shout and that voice of that message brought a resurrection in the spiritual and that spiritual Resurrection was done by the shout hallelujah hallelujah why because the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what is the shout for Amen to call out of bride out of denomination listen and it is the rising of the sun said what is this Resurrection in the evening time you have to pay attention to his words he's not playing games he's giving prophecy he said a resurrection in the evening time he said it is out of dark denominationalism into the world word age into the bride age that's what he said and that same message what did it do did it condemn any did it condemn many yes it condemn organization told him you you receive the mark of the beast Eternal d by receiving that thing that's Eternal damnation who was doing that the son executing judgment amen hallelujah hallelujah he come down to the Earth amen and through Veil he was executing judgment damnation but to the seat of God he was giving life hallelujah hallelujah glory to God like we said this morning that woman that was caught in the act of adultery glory to God was going to rest Stone amen but Jesus come the great judge of God hallelujah to whom arment is committed Hallelujah because he is a son of man you see and he was in that form son of man and he said neither do I condemn don't do it again oh brother let me say something that in 1963 glory to God the Angels were ready to Stone the Earth the Angels ready to Stone the Earth amen amen but the same one that appeared as glory to God held back the wrath of God Amen and bailed through a prophet amen he the prach like mes yes Lord amen said neither do I condemn thee you never did it in the fles Hallelujah you never did it in the first place it's not your fault I don't condemn you hallelujah hallelujah I will S no more don't do it again but the Angels were ready to St us judgment angels with files in their hands ready to pour them out hallelujah hallelujah but the judge said I don't condemn her was a son of man executing judgment and grace to the of Christ do you understand but listen the prophet says the TR the predestinated bride is to come and be expressed in a season in a certain special season are you with Hallelujah Jesus said you were willing for a season live in the light of John but now you're asking you're asking what this is hallelujah hallelujah what is the manifested word of the hour oh my look in the message trying to do God of service without being his will 1965 listen to what the prophet says real carefully we notice that God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season predestinated SE yes Martin Luther know nothing about the message of today Presbyterians Catholics couldn't know Luther's message John Wesley couldn't know Luther's message w we couldn't know Pentecostal message pcal can't know this message see listen he reveals it in his Seasons yeah in his season Hallelujah because it is a seed and it grows and it matures and it reveals himself the last part of that process is himself coming back out of we're we're going to hit this in a little bit what he said right there but watch what he says he says and then the heat of the sun it tenders it up brings the seed out of the ground there come the leaves the hot sun ripen it regulates the sun regulates the nature to meet his word he also regulates the church the predestinated the bride listen to meet the season that they are living in that they are living in am this there is a season that the bride is living in this I read the other quote he said in the mind of God the bride is to be expressed on the earth in a certain season and he knows when and when she is expressed on the earth in her season that is the word seed manifested hallelujah hallelujah he says now are you getting this it says to meet the season that they are living in nature itself tells us what's taking place today nations are breaking the Earth is sinking handwriting is on the wall we see the church and the state that is in we see the bride and the state that she is in hallelujah hallelujah and We Know by Nature that the church is getting ready to leave Hallelujah that the church is getting ready to leave what a glorious time it is a time that all prophets long to see this hallelujah thank you Lord oh my they all long to see a group of that will defy death that will defy death that will never taste the grave hallelujah hallelujah because Jesus Paid the price for my de for myb and for my so I don't have to die don't have to go to the grave and don't have to go to hell hallu he died for me he died for you so you don't have to die he went to the Grave so you won't go you say he didn't die for all the others yes but they went in the grave yes hallelujah hallelujah but full Redemption is for a living bride that's the and she is living in the season where she's getting ready Prophet word words he says now he Reveals His word only in his season only in his season Martin in his season Lu in his season see Jesus read the same Bible that the Pharisees read but they were trying to keep the corn in the early stage when it was time for ripening and they were still talking about ABC yeah AB season is good brother but that season is over it's rening time look they fa to see their hour the Pharisees fa to see their hour God reveals this word in the season to whom he chooses to reveal it why it's by election it's by predestination he chooses who he's going to reveal it to you in the decreed season in the pred destinated season for the expressed thoughts to manifest on Earth and become part of the body of Jesus Christ Oh Glory look what he says he chooses who he reveals it to I choose who he reveals it to because he chose that before the foundation of the world by his fore knowledge amen hidden from man he reveals them as he will and he is chosen the season that he chosen the person Hallelujah am it's individual are you with me now in first Thessalonians 416 said the Lord himself shall from heaven with a shout hallelujah amen hallelujah amen has he come down with the shout and the Rapture message he said that's already happen it's time amen that's what he said I ain't waiting for the shout any longer brother the shout already came but Prophet said it where is the attraction on the mountain he said three years ago Revelations 10 1 to was prophecy but now it's history the prophet said not me the prophet prop hallelujah hallelujah revelation 1 to S is now history oh my GL brother it's hard for people to come out of the Season amen of that light and comeing to another season why oh because it's brother so and so it's sister so and so that can't be the word that's the same thing they said about Jesus he's the son of the he's the son of Mary oh brother but I've been born again I've been born of the same word that Jesus was bornu oh my father looking at my first birth God is looking at the second hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my first word ain't the word yet oh not yet my second birth is the word made but one of these days my second my first birth will we change in a moment in a twin of an hallelujah oh brother this is why it's hard for people to turn the corner amen you cannot recognize what the season is that we're living in well season amen I just read the quotes amen amen hallelujah am Hallelujah so amen so the season that we're in what season is it it's the season hallelujah hallelujah of the Bride yes I hope people not offended because Jesus when the discip when some of his followers that still wanted to stay in that life they were asking what do we tell Jesus he says ask him if he's the one that was to come we wait for another one bring it on brother to the bride hallelujah amen is this the bra come on tell Isaiah 61 is being Isaiah 96 has been fulfilled that these scriptures that testify me have been fulfilled that's why John testified of but then afterward The Works testified of him and then after that the father testified and then for the end the scriptures look the season that we're in is the season for the bride to come to full maturity in her place in Christ and when the last member the bride which is that place in that position in thison the resurrection that's the word and easy you see because look what brother R says God's Got A Time for all things it's got a time we can plant a corn and we got a time to plow we have a time to harvest spring rains summer rainfall snow you can't just say I'll plant wheat today and tomorrow I'll Harvest God has times for Seasons he has seasons for his word he has times in the scripture where he said the presence of the Lord was present to heal the sick and Jesus was ministering to and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick you see what I mean we find out that God works everything seasonally amen when Moses what he failed to find was the time limit of God see now when God revealed himself in the burning bush he found that the very thing that was in the burning bush is the thing that he lacked I think that's a whole lot of with us today many times we try to do the program ourselves and we fail to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will of God and the time of God what God would would it do you to plant what good would it do you if you plant corn out today and it rocks see nothing would happen if it happened to sprout in the corn weather in the cold weather it would kill the germ it wouldn't work so we have to come in the season brother was talking about in this message believer's position in Christ he said there is a season when God has said in his word Romans 8 Ephesians 1 and many other scriptures he has already prophesied that there would come a season Hallelujah a season when there would be sons of God believers that would come to their position in Christ but it has to be in the season in the time which has been decreed by the word of God that's why when brother Ram preached spiritual food and do season he never quoted a scripture but I believe that scripture was pertaining to him Matthew 24 verse 44 and 45 where Jesus said blessed is the man that the Lord has called as a steward a good Steward to feed his servants meat in due season and brother B was preaching the message spiritual food due season and he was saying that is the message that is going forth now you understand hallelujah hallelujah and brother that is still the fruit of God that we are feeding on for he said an anointed on at the end time it's the body word of the son of man that's what we're feeding on then he says this food was not for the denomination he said the world knows nothing of it it's secret there not known this secret place you see the goodness and the mercies of God if you're sick there's healing there like Jesus told the woman the the sosian woman it's not it's not meat to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs Hallelujah that's not right because he had not been sent to the Gentiles and now today he visits the Gentiles in their time in their season Hallelujah you say what is what is it that the message doesn't go in those big places like the big Crusades like amongst the denominations it's not there food it's not to the church amen what they call Food it's the bride food did you hear what he said whose food is it whose food is it whose food is it it's food Glory it's for a spiritual food for the bride in a certain season that's why when brother Adam had the dream that he was bringing in great big watermelons great big things and cucumbers and radishes and and melons right he was bringing into the Tabernacle and God told him amen record these messages store food because there is a people that is coming in the future that this is going to be their food their food the brid food embarrass God left things in this message for our God left things in the word for you and me I left things in this message the bride recognize this is my season she would go to the message and she would find yes he said it's my season yes the prophet said but that was the prophecy and this is the Fulfillment of the prophecy the bride would be the final voice to the final age Glory final Voice final Voice final did he say final did he say final did he say final did he say final the final under her messenger she is the final voice because the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing the prophet the and the spirit the prophet the spirit the bride and the spirit say the same thing why because it's the same spirit in the prophet it's the same spirit in the bride and it's the same Spirit Hallelujah hallu in the in the final listen Hallelujah are you with me now I don't get carried away here don't don't don't go off like in your mind somewhere else stay in line with the thought look look what he says he says the Rapture is already in you yes it's already completed we are waiting for the Rapture yes which will come but everything will happen in its season so the Rapture comes in a certain season God I just read to you that when the Bri comes to her season her season is getting ready to leave her season is the season of The Rapture is that right what he says it will happen in season then this is the message uh Serv we would see Jesus and the message I have heard but now I see he says this inspiration is being poured out gather the bride the elect only the elect will see it you have hit this from the eyes and wise anded to baby that you would learn inspiration is striking it's time of the calling out of a bride what did he say spoken words original SE and the Seven seal the Revival for a generation is a calling out of a people when the seals were open it was to call the people out to give them a chance at the word at the Revival hallelujah hallelujah he said what is the inspiration striking it's calling out a bride and he says it's always been that way it's only poured out upon the elected seed now listen but remember the promised word of God through the mouth of Jesus the very God in the beginning that spoke creation into existence before the foundations of the world that said let there be and there was he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not but as many as did know him he gave him the power to become the sons of God the very Creator himself when he raised up Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus from the dead what did he say he said we read it brother quot it right here think this not strange for the hour is coming when all that is in the grave we'll hear the voice we'll hear the voice of the son of man see how that is so perfect scripture doesn't contradict the prophet neither does the prophet contradict the scripture read correctly verse 28 and verse 25 and then read this quote and see what the prophet is saying right see what the prophet is saying in verse 28 Jesus said Marvel not for the hour is coming that all that are in the graves shall hear his voice some will rise to Everlasting condemnation some to life and brother bradam says that's the voice voice of the son of man but in verse 25 Jesus said the hour is coming and now is when the dead he didn't say all that are in the grave the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they shall live you see the difference how many see the difference say Amen you see the difference verse 28 is the voice of the Son of Man voice 25 voice of the Son of God GL and the prophet ain't contradicting it because he's cling it exactly like verse 28 says think is not strange for the hour is coming when all that are in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man brother Adam said denominational gra hallelujah hallelujah when he preached he let us know there was grav of denomination he quoted Ezekiel 37 Hallelujah he said they come out of the graves and then he said why do you seek for the living among the dead he said denominational tombs Jesus is not in there he is calling people out of the grave but some come out of denomination only to be condemned you know why they can be condemned because they heard the truth they knew the truth and they rejected the truth that is eternal damnation and some come out of the Grave unto life and Resurrection GL that's the voice of the son of man the Lord himself come down in a shout through Mal through Revelation 10:7 to Luke 17:30 it was the voice of the son of man in its season because brother says right here they all here the voice of the son of man it has to happen in its season Hallelujah in its season I making this up it's right here in the word so the son of man calling forth bringing Resurrection out of dark denomination Len it was in a season and many in that season Hallelujah because he was a bright and Shining Light but when the season of the Bride has come to recognize what our our season is hallelujah hallelujah brother said after the ministry of the son of man comes the ministry the Son of God and the Son of God is the Holy Spirit in a many membered body Hallelujah that's the spirit of God not in one person but a many member God press the anointed man anointed people hallelujah hallelujah do you see yes what is your attraction on the mountain was talking about John the Baptist and what is he saying he said John the Baptist he was a young man he was preaching Isaiah 40 I'm the voice of one crash in the wilderness he told him I'm Malachi 3 Hallelujah preparing the way before the face Hallelujah huj don't you know these fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled Hallelujah and brother said in the message this day the scriptures fulfilled 196 in Jefferson he said Revelations 10 1 to7 this day this is fulfilled Hallelujah he was fulfilling the prophecy it was becoming history amen but there was another prophecy that he was giving of another season and he says see prophecy was being fulfilled but about that time when he was saying that the prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said now that was the attraction amen hallelujah brother it's the truth anyhow now that was the attraction it it it's changed verse paragraph 79 he's speaking of this when he said Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world he said now that was the attraction it has changed from the prophet to his Prophet Hallelujah 79 what is the attraction on the mountain it has changed from the prophet to his prophecy he says notice what come to pass here come an ordinary man a carpenter son walking out in the water just ordinary and the great prophet said Hallelujah it behooves us Hallelujah Jesus said it behooves us to fulfill our righteous who was the corpor body of Jesus Malachi 3 the prophet yes sir the prophet washed the body come on brother GL and who washes the mystical Mal The Prophet by the washing of the Water by word hallelujah hallelujah God if a if the prophet washed the bridegroom a prophet has to wash Mal wash the bridegroom wases theu oh say brother does brother B say that spoken hold on come on spoken words The Original Seed yeah he said the true prophet of God will proclaim the word in the last days denominations will hate him but he will be like he was when he come at the first coming of Christ you generation of viers but the predestinated will hear and make ready for the countdown the Royal seed of Abraham's Faith holding the word of God regardless for they were predestined the messenger of Malachi 4 will appear listen at God's appointed time in his season Hallelujah didn't John didn't Jesus say John you you rejoiced for a season in his light I know hell screeching because what the devil hates brother is the present living one he can't stand listen we are looking for him he says we believe he will come according to his word will be at the end time which it is now time for for to see it according correctly listen you be dedicated to the word as they have always been God will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did for Elijah for it is Elijah coming making ready for the Mount Zion Rapture who who's he preparing amen for a people that's going to go in the rapt all right then he says Jesus said in the last days it would be like lot's time preaching would be with the spirit and straight line of God's word because so much has been called the truth many will misunderstand this true Messenger and then he says I got wrote down here prophecy remember I told you I read the quote right here was going to change from the prophet he said it to the prophecy then he's over here he says Elijah will come prepare the people for the M Zion Rapture many will miss understand him he says I got wrote down here prophecy p r o p h e c y p r o f C he spells it and then he says because so much has been called by God's truth by fakers many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger many true mins will misunderstand that messenger wow at the end time prophecies
