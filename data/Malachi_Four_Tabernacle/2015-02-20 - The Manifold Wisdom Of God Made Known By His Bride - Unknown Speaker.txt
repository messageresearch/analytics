recommending him this Mighty angel that has come down from heaven amen and he is ordained to meet you here tonight is that what we have come for tonight all we have to do is surrender ourselves amen cast down every reasoning come with confidence he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is a and he is a a rewarder of them that diligently seek is that right so he is here we must approach him with faith we must approach him knowing that he is here amen and he has something a reward he has something for us amen there any sin they shall be forgiven there be sickness they shall be healed is that right amen if there be any weariness amen it shall be given strength Hallelujah if there be some that have no hope amen he is our hope if our faith is a little low amenallah he is our faith how many know that we don't have our own faith but we are to receive his faith Hallelujah that's the faith of Jesus Christ amen so we must look into the Unseen it it's tremendous that we can call him the Holy Spirit but yet it's not something that's uh you know some wind or something that's just floating around it's a person huj amen and that person is called the holy ghost that person Hallelujah is called the pillar of fire that person is the angel of God and when brother would refer himself to the holy spirit amen like I told you Sunday in the message that deep call unto the Deep he says Dear colored people that are Shing he is already ready to help and to believe to to help the people in need he says just a moment I see the holy H spirit standing in the corner Hallelujah can the Holy Spirit stand he's a spirit he's floating around right no he is standing he's a person he's an angel I see the holy spirit standing in the corner it's over a colored lady she's looking this way she has been praying she has a growth and that growth is in her throat she's got her head up will you accept your healing lady the lady sitting right behind you there she has a growth that's in her shoulders both of you stand on your feet right now the two l two colored ladies Jesus Christ gives you both go home and be made well for the glory of God have faith in God do not disbel but all things are possible so they not believe what a faith Bank what a faith bank is in the building it's getting real milky over the building you are certainly in the spirit of the Lord now now you see brother what that does the Holy Spirit the angel of God standing in the corner but after that is received after it begins to operate and the and the people see that it's there then their faith begins to draw that presence and that presence is no longer just standing in the corner it begins to get Misty it's milky hallelujah amen his presence is like a cloud like it was behind the curtain behind the veil it's the sh Hallelujah of Glory begin to fill the whole house amen and then it will shut upon you hallelujah hallelujah of fire Hallelujah so you see brother and sister first it was the faith bank and then it gets real milky glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah so that's the same God that is here tonight that's the same angel of God that we're recommending and and we know that in Exodus uh 23 that was the angel that was leading Moses right we got that straight right it was Christ right well Paul in Hebrews 11 speaking of Moses right what he says there is tremendous that we can apply to our lives and seeing how this same Angel is with us it was what the prophet it was with the prophet right it's with us tonight and Paul says uh and and you don't have to read it's okay but in verse 26 we know he's speaking of Moses since verse 23 but in verse 26 he says esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect un the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him as seeing him who is invisible Exodus 23 who's he following who's leading him the angel behold I sent my angel before thee to lead you right Exodus 23 is that right what did God say my name is in him hallelujah hallelujah hallu well Paul knowing who that was because he met the same Pillar of Fire and he said Lord who are th and he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute he met the same angel that that Moses Hallelujah and and Sten in Acts 13 or Act 7 he he he preaches of this Angel and he said it was an angel in the burning bush right well look at this here Paul calls him Christ right he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches am he followed Christ but verse 27 says as seeing him who is invisible you understand as seeing him who is invisible see the holy spirit is a spirit is God is that right but that invisible you can see by your eyes of understanding by your eyes of faith and even by your natural eyes am but your natural eyes can deceive you Satan put a counterfeit because Paul says angels of the devil demons appear as angels of light amen your eyes can deceive but your faith in the word eyes of understanding you can discern as Paul said even if an angel comes down from heaven and preaches something else contrary to what this gospel has been preached let him be a cur hallelujah hallelujah amen let alone if he comes from you know Washington or some other state amen Paul said if he come from Heaven amen but if there come one from somewhere else how much more amen but notice seeing him who is invisible to perceive Amen to to to understand John 33 Jesus told Nicodemus no one can see the kingdom of God if he's not born of the water of and to see is to understand but but Moses was seeing him who is invisible you cannot see something that's invisible amen if it's invisible it's not visible to the Natural Eye am but he was seeing him amen amen he amen rightall now now in Genesis 18 Abraham is sitting there what does the Bible say we've all read the scripture we've been talking about it lately a lot is that right it says and Abraham lifted up his eyes mhm Daniel 10 verse 5 and he was praying by the river right and he's praying and the Bible says and lifting up his eyes saw a man his eyes flames of fire right amen his face shining like the sun voice like the voice of a multitude every time you see in the scripture that they're lifting up their eyes they're seeing a vision they're seeing an appearance they're seeing a manifestation of godu you understand remember we preached not too long look up for your Redemption draws we spoke about Jesus telling us when you see these things lift up your eyes cuz your Redemption but we're not looking up to this blue sky you see what I'm saying not looking up to these clouds here you're looking up until your Redemption coming you're looking up that dimension of the word to that upper civilization that's what you're looking up to amen is that right second Corinthians 4 18 uh uh Paul said we look not to the things that are seen but we look unto the Unseen amen because the things are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are Eternal is that what Paul said amen so this is what we want to see tonight amen we we want to see this Mighty Angel we want to lift up our eyes and see him Hallelujah hallelu standing in the corn amen in our midst in his word is that right in this Revelation is that right so now turn with me to Ephesians 3 and I'm just happy excited of what God is doing amen and at the same time in responsibility that comes God giving Revelations like this because I believe his need the am and uh God doesn't just give a revelation to make the man big that's not what it's for it's to edify is to help is to build is to live fath Hallelujah and that's our that's our heart that's our purpose yes Ephesians 3 uh amen verse three how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a before and few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known under the sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should the fellow Hees and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel where was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me whom am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of now listen here 9 and 10 and to make all men see you hearing me to make all men see hallelujah amen see what now notice what what we began with seeing to the invisible right lifting up our eyes and these things now look to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church amen might be known by the church amen the manifold wisdom of God but I'mma try to I'mma close early today amen hallelujah but I I I that the reason I do this friends I hope you understand why why I do these things like this I want you to get it I want it to be so simple that even the the child can understand Hallelujah see what I'm saying CU I know that that I I can I can bring a lot of things out tonight that a lot of people would catch amen but some wouldn't see I'm saying so that's why we have to be patient and understand purpose why we we pause like this sometimes amen amen now look Ephesians 3 the manifold wisdom of God be made known by the two principalities princip powers in Heavenly places amen hallelujah how many know brothers and sisters that when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost God transforms your life BR out of the life of sin amen amen am you surrender yourself to God he begins to work in you amen am begins to take out the things that you used to have as habits you begin to get freed of spirits and ways of thinking Paul said be renew your mind by the word of God in our reasonable service so God begins to do a transforming work in US is that right when when we speak of that brother we can speak of that and say well that's you know that's that's that's the beginning but really when you are baptized by the Holy Ghost you enter into the body of Christ that is brother bam said that's part of the mystery how many hear me T part of the mystery that was hidden in God for the foundation of the world where do he say that the message Christ is a mystery of God revealed 1963 he said this hidden Mystery in the back part of God's mind when it's personally revealed to you that's the new listen brother ties your new birth amen with this mystery hidden before the foundation of the world you know why I believe he he he he connected it that way we're reading it tonight Ephesians 3 amen amen amen look what he says in the message the junction of time 1956 there's people in the world today that after 2,000 years of gospel preaching they don't know what it means to be born again of the spirit of God they don't don't know what omnipotence means that God in his great omnipotent power can transform a soul from a street sin to an Angelic position in God's kingdom what to an Angelic position in God's Kingdom as a son or daughter of God Angelic position he's not saying that you're you become an Angel that's not what he's saying and he's not saying that you're taking the place of an angel with wings that's your position that's not what he's saying but he is saying something that people don't understand what it means to be born of the spirit of God a soul transformed Hallelujah am by the Holy Ghost amen is lifted into an Angelic position in the kingdom of God hallelujah he says they don't understand now the Mage the future home 64 brother Adam is speaking amen of how that in the beginning amen Adam in his when he was in his position Adam in the Garden of Eden he was in his position according to Genesis 1 verse 26 and 27 he was controller he was ruler hallelujah amen of everything that move of the foul of the fishes of the cattle is that right dominion over all things control power over the Earth amen amen we can go through a lot of scriptures and show you that's exactly why God made man uh where are we going to rule eternity some other planet somewhere on this Earth myu Kings and Priests a king has government a king has Dominion is that right a king has a throne Hallelujah and the bride is Kings and Priests and we shall rule upon the Earth from Genesis to Revelation it shows you what man was made for now Adam in this position he he all things amen were perfect they were running in God's order and there was a plan that was going to unfold itself from the beginning and we know that right amen Adam had the title deed to the Earth is that right he had the title deed of redemption he had the book Hallelujah contain the names of which were going to come forth by the spoken wordl but he lost it he went back to God is that right amen Amen brother bam said now I'm in the same line brother bam said when when when a Son of God a daughter of God is born of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you're filled with the Holy Ghost he said that deed is given to you it's in your hand Hallelujah the same thing that Adam had in the beginning now the believer has why because this Mighty Angel come down from heaven with a little book open in his hand he sent it to the seventh angel is that right and that same one comes to the bride and says go get the book and eat itj hallu so now we're eating the book now you and I are receiving this Hallelujah this Authority this this this ruling this positioning and this is what it means when Paul speaks of the manifestation of the sons of God that Earth and nature is growing and crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God why because they were put into bondage when Adam fell but they will be liberated is that right when you and I become manifest hallu amen that's not just milu there this is a holy convocation by the Eternal one that came to redeem us and he come to redeem us hallelujah and take us and take us back letting us know that we are part of this how do you know you are a part listen because the word of the hour promise of the day what is it a restoration this message is a restoration back to the first day hallelujah amen back to the beginning he says he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers he's quoting Malachi but he doesn't take it to us being restored just only back to Pentecost back there 2,000 years ago no he's taking us farther back he says Malachi 4 to restore our hearts bringing a restoration back of the of the Pentecostal genuine not sensation and will manifest the evening light and the same son that showed in the morning is Promised for this day now remember Adam's position and then brother says the same message it's only atmospheres the sin that is upon the Earth will be destroyed New heavens and new earth is that right so when people hear that they say well God's going to just blow to pieces this Earth is going to make a new one no he's not no he's only going to take the sin he's going to burn it with fire is that right Hallelujah he's going to renovate he's going to restor amen hallelujah and in the new Heavens you might say well what is heaven if there's going to be new Heavens it's probably not this Sky it's going to be a different kind of Sky see but that's not what it's talking about the heav he says is an atmosphere we realize that Heavens definition of Heavens means atmospheres of above now brother Adam is speaking of new heavens and new earth now I'm going slow so you can catch it now brother say all this that exists right here right now is evil spirits in the heavens in the atmospheres above but when God comes to destroy this there going to be new heaven why Ain going to be no more evil spirit in the heaven in the atmosphere amen Ain going to be no more old Heavens contaminated with principalities and Powers the the power of the prince of the air Ephesians 6 we wrestle not did our brother pray earlier amen Ephesians 6 we wrestle not against flesh and blood is that right but against Power and principalities that are in the atmosphere above are contaminated with evil spirits brother says and then we have that condescends into the natural because that caus sickness it caused from the beginning when sin came in when Adam lost his position that he had he become subject to sin when he was one subject to the word amen once he was subject to the will and the plan of God but when he come out from under that he forfeited it amen he fell from that position and he become subject to time to sin to corruption amen you understand but this is taking us back to that position Hallelujah now listen says in all all this exists that's in the earth now these manmade system politics sin all kinds of evil spirits the world is contaminated all the heavens above is contaminated with evil spirits he says we're going to go deep all this that exists in the heavens and the atmospheres the Earth which is now it you see it holds the Earth right now holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose are you hearing it wasn't made to have demons in the atmospheres above ruling and controlling Hallelujah that's not what the Earth was made for it was made for the sons of God Amen in Angelic positions in atmospheres above Hallelujah ruling and controlling and raining but because of sin Satan took over you see and he become in The Prince and the power of the but that was Adam's position Hallelujah he took that position and his and his evil spirits begin to rule and control and what do they do from that realm what are they doing right now what they've been doing for all these years what do they do do they control governments influence do they influence the media do they influence religion all this is demonic power influencing politics governments Kings presidents you understand religion economics amen and then it begins to cond sin sickness corruption amen amen all this is because there's power influen you understand but brother this is what the war is about if you if you have never understood what we're fighting for this is what we're fighting for that's right do you understand now what the Christian fight really is for take what is the good fight amen why is he the Lord of hosts what's the war about amen amen that's what the war taking the Hallelujah the war is for power the war is for control hallelu guess what you can read the back of the book the end of the story and we win Hallelujah that's right right so we're not fighting not knowing what we're doing we got to fight knowing we have the victory Hallelujah is that right we are Kings we priests right now we are the sons of God right now we have authority right now we have the power to control amen under the direction of the Holy Spirit you see how rich this this is Rich oh yes now look brother says all this exists amen and what caused this sin he said Satan is still here that's the reason that all these things happen come on he is still here all his evil forces are still here that's why the Earth is now filthy there's scum ridiculous things War politics adultery all kinds of fil is because that Satan is the ruler of this Earth and this atmosphere take it back controlling the people controlling the world under his demonic influence amen but you and I my brother my sister were not under that influence we have been taken out of the kingdom of darkness amen into his marvelous life hallelujah we're under another another influence we're being influenced by Angelic beings we're being influenced by the Holy Ghost we're being directed we're being led and we're being told what to do we're receiving orders from headquarters hallelujah our headquarters is not on this Earth it's in Heavenly places on from the Throne of God he is still giving orders hallelujah hallelujah and those orders must be carried out exactly to the letter and there's no other force that can stop that from Hallelujah When God says it shall be th oh brother the devil shakes there's no way he can stop it there's no strong demon that is strong enough to stop that order he'll fight he'll try to fight but he can't stop he can't stop brother Adam says now listen amen he says both heavens and earth is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God but Jesus is there to intercede for and we have anate with Father H that God knows that if we're tempted and we fall and we lose our vision a little bit and we begin to get a little weak amen we all we need to do is confess our sins get back up continue F because what the devil wants is for you to feel condemned and not worthy of the blessings of God but I'm here to tell you that demon out hallelujah hallelujah you're a Son of God the Hallelujah hu in this message he says in that blood it still covers Us while the accusers keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this he said the blood speaks the blood speaks better things the blood of hallelujah amen when all that gossip when all that evil speaking said all that he did this and he did that they did this and they did that there's a voice speaking higher than that Hallelujah to God and we must come under that influence under that direction amen because that pertains to you pertains to me amen amen what is Jesus what is Jesus what is he tell the disciples don't Rejoice because the demons are subject unto because brother there's going to be many that are going to come to him and say Lord have not we cast out demons have not we done Mighty things in your name they say depart from me he workers over iniquity I never knew you so it's not just because of the demons are subject but because your name is written and how do you know that your name is written you'll hear itlu you'll hear your name being called Hallelujah hallu no one knows the new name sa he that receives a little White Rock with a new name it's given to you but only you know my name is in hallelujah hallelujah GL so don't Rejoice because the demons are subject but Rejoice there's a greater purpose your name is written in heaven and you have a position to take as a son of God and once you come into that position brother and sister just like we've been teaching but brother Ram would say I'm waiting for the presence of this Angel and he says now I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God Authority that's power bringing everything subject why because of the presence of that angel is your position that's your position that's why Capone is the presence of the angel of God when you come into there I'll meet you in there I'll meet with you in your position brother bradam listen to me come to his position he was he was doing the work of an evangelist even up to 1962 taking s with Jesus he says I'm not in the office of a prophet I'm not in the office of a prophet he says I'm doing the work of an evangelist but brother when he come into his office Prophet in3 the Angels come to pick him up and take him into the presence of the Angel and the angel said I'll meet you Hallelujah this will be your thirding said if you can understand this is theallu and then he said in the seven seal remember I quoted in Sunday in in the seven seal brother said Remember the vision the angel told me I'll meet you in there this will be your third and then brother says and came the sword fell to my hand and a voice not from behind not from above from inside this is third did the angel meet him who was that angel that was speaking to him that was telling him I'll meet you in there it was Christ angel in that CL I'll meet you in there not only that promise to the Propet but it's for you in your in your your I will meet with you and this will be your that's why it was hisdu is that what the the angel said and this will be your third pool he didn't say the he said your third that just come fresh right there why did he say yours because it was his position Hallelujah but you have yours too hallu hallelujah amen GL hallu is that right remember not too long ago uh perhaps I don't know how long that was but we we quoted out of Exodus is that right am what did God told Moses build the Tabernacle put three stages right and in the holy of holies build a mercy seat made out of wood cover it with gold put two cherub is that right remember we that and in the scripture in the Bible That's why that angel never spoke anything that wasn't in this B amen hallelujah even when he said I'll meet you in there the same exact words are in the Bible God told Moses when you once you make that inner place the holy of holies he told Moses I will meet you and this will be your voice Hallelujah of the sign because like Moses he had two signs sign in the hand hallelujah amen and then to deserve but then come the voice of the sign the voice amen you understand the two signs was first and second pool but the voice of the sign wasu now you understand it now understand Satan is fighting this even when we don't we not aware of but we have to be cons that this war is taking remember we've been preaching on Daniel right preaching about Abraham over there Genesis 18 right is that right okay now you've heard what we've said tonight brother says all the sin that's in the heavens above he is the prince of the power of the air he keeps off the blessings from God he Wars off so that the blessings of God come to you I'm reading the quote paragraph 114 the future home this is what he does he's fighting so that the blessing of God won't come to you Hallelujah now now I'm going say something and the way we're seeing this you're going to be able to understand he's not fighting just so that you won't feel a little something it's more than because many feel Sensations and the devil ain't fighting man what he's fighting something more right he's fighting something hallu Hallelujah because sometimes we might think well he's fighting so you know so I won't feel chills at my back no no no that's okay you can feel CH amen but there's something more than that amen there's something more deep to the soul and then the anointing you're not waiting for the anointing to come from somewhere now you're a carrier of that anointing and you know your position and when you need it comes out of here am that's the difference amen it comes out of the inside the thr we're going to need this we need it now but we're going to need it more as the days go forward this is preparation time we're going to need to know this power know how to use it know what it's for and brother bam said oh my M Look Away to Jesus he said the third pool will be be for the total lost amen it'll be for the bride and the church who's the third for for the bride and the church am amen amen now listen he says he's the princip of the power of the air he Wars off the blessings from God there he comes Thunderbolts of lightning strike the Earth everything from the heavens sheets of slicing rainon storm amen that was back in 64 you know what they call them now tsunamis tsunamis same thing who causes these tsunamis people blame it on God amen amen science says it's nature yes but who's controll who causes these storms who caused the storm when brother R was in Germany in that tent preaching the gospel remember that who caused the storm which God what were they doing saying father son holy we call this stor brother bam said in the message the name of Jesus he said demon travel through those mhm that's what they were using M and they were causing the storm then they sat in the congregation stood there said something is wrong here amen the angel of the Lord come these men are sitting here and there they are they have they are the ones causing this amen he said in the name of Jesus Christ iure the Spirit come out of this amen amen said t began blowing and this is that right then they challenged him is that right amen he said if you have power a man was lifting a table up into the air by demonic power said if you have authority and Power make this table to come down is that right amen it's a war war for power forp for soul amen and brother bam said it just reminds me of Elijah car saying cry because brother bam said he says I wanted to I wanted to show something he said in the name of the Holy Roman Catholic Church I call that table to come down he said the table stood there he said in the name of father son Holy Ghost Call that table to come down he said nothing happened and he said now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let the table come down he said that table fell down it almost broke the legs off hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if demons TR through those names through the name travels the Holy Spirit there's power in the name when you say come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ spirit and life is coming forward is that right that's why the demons told the sons of right Jesus we know amen Paul we know who who he is but who are you and they were using the name of Jesus but they had no Authority no power now I'mma close tonight amen you see how we can get into the word and we can just keep on going now listen he is the prin power of the air amen now when Jesus was out on on the boat that night when it was being pitched around like a bottle sto on the sea is that right remember great storm disciples begin to get scared and they woke Jesus up Hallelujah brother ad preached wake Jesus wake Jesus but brother we got to wake him up inside of him amen he's got to be worked up amen amen but inside of you yes siru he says what was causing this stor that almost drowned him it was 10,000 Devils that swore they would drown him they were the ones that caused the storm but when Jesus got up out of his sleep what's going on Jesus about said you men of little faith Haven I taught you there's power in the word I you to curse the tree to say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart where is

but greater is he that is in me he that is in is me he that is in my trial is he that is in me amen he that is in the score so he spoke the thir and in this day brother these things are still taking place in The Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah hallu I told you of a testimony this Sunday is that right of a sister here in our congregation just experienced this last week glory to God Amen I believe not too long ago a resurrection took place as well do you believe that amen glory to God what is this brother it's the manifestation of what the holy spirit is teaching us is being made known by teaching but it's also being manifested in Human vessels Hallelujah the word hallelujah hallelujah being fulf amen believe that so Satan is fighting this now listen to what brother ROM say glory to God in the message is there anything too hard for the Lord 1960 says Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent on a real hot day it must have been real hot notice the weather you ever notice when it's real hot are you relaxed how beautiful the weather no you're not like that especially mewe real hot right look at this real hot weather he says perhaps a lot of complaints coming by the the grass was well gone the cattle was be coming very very th the water supply was about gone they found the water holes and they were digging and digging till the water was seeping through the rocks and they had not enough water supply for them you know sometimes when things are going wrong We Know by Nature that it's darkest before day and sometimes when when we see disastrous things happening especially to Believers we must bear in our mind that it's Satan trying to block the blessings that's on its Road talking about who was coming to him who going to come to him Hallelujah moving before you ever heard brother my first time hearing brother bam say on the message the Bible don't say that but he was by Revelation by Vision seen this Satan moving before the visitation hallelujah it's Satan trying to block the blessing that's on its Road he says that was the very much in this case Satan listen to Abraham AB Satan was trying to tempt them to feel that they had done wrong and was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give Abraham and Sarah what was Satan doing tempting them so that they could feel oh I F in this temptation I don't want to go to church I go hide in the corn that's his plan that's his plan don't listen to get it right because he is trying to block this visitation of the mighty Angel and that's why brother have you seen that before these Revelations begin to come how things begin to move that right brother a lot of you know what I'm talking about just before these things begin to open up about the angel of the Lord wasn't things a little tense wasn't things a little you know what I mean that's that's Satan it's not your brother not your Hallelujah amen well actually brother says 90% The Devil 10% him your brother so a lot of times the brothers have a little percentage that's what the prophet said and that 10% we have to Humble ourselves we have to say I was wrong amen but the 90% is the devil amen let's him out to God says before that visitation there was a lot of complaints lot of complaints I'm reading the cross he said try Satan was trying to block the blessing was on this road and this was very much in this case Satan was trying to Temp them to make them feel that they had done wrong he was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give Abraham and Sarah we have been taught in the scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love God no matter how bad it seems remember it must be working for your good and I'm so glad of that Satan been after me all day so I just believe that there's a blessing in stored here in this city hallelujah thank you Lord thank you somewhere and why in this city because in this city there is a prince there's a a power that is governing amen and then under that he has others ruling certain areas have you ever noticed when you go into certain places there's a certain spirit that moves in that area is that right amen amen there's a spirit of suicide always in a certain place people jumping off Coronado Bridge why the spirit is there and then the people that live there is that right there's some spirits come to anoint them and put those stocks in their amen amen yes people can confess it amen not to put anybody on the spot but those things come I don't want to live anymore I don't want to then you find out where is that anointing brother said when I go to a certain place he says when I flew into Phoenix Pho said I've been picking up a spirit here in this city said that spirit is of said that's the spirit that moves here and I know it personally when the Holy Spirit is supposed to be influencing the church other Spirits influence him amen amen oh my and those especially ministers little little young brother don't even GRE him amen amen amen whether there Spirits in different areas remember the demons that were in Legion he was going to cast them back to hell right but what did they say no no no no no leave us in the P they want to stay in the same area but the pigs had more sense than human beings they'd rather be dead than to be possessed by so they threw themselves in the water am they had more sense humans humans are demon possessed and they still want to keep living P but when but when the pigs killed themselves what happened next read the story of the Bible and then brother Bram the prophetic eye tells us he says those demons come out of them and they went into the people City very next part of that scripture the people of the herdsmen of of of the herdsmen not pastors herdsmen amen of the pigs they came out right and they said we don't want you here the people of the City come out and said get your disciples Jesus we don't want you here leave who was that the demon in the man in the pigs and from the pigs they went into the people of that City they stay in areas yes sir certain Spirits in certain areas but that's why brother said Satan has been after me all day so I believe that there's going to be a blessing in store for this city am when he and he Tri to block what he's trying to do is trying to get you to disbelieve if you that's the worst thing stand your feet that's the worst thing that you can do see is to disbelieve God but as soon as you get a little scared maybe I haven't done this listen maybe I haven't done this maybe I haven't done that he says right then Satan has got your blessing conquered Satan has got your blessing conquer that's why it's so important to not be in that condition when someone is in that condition brother it's horrible there's no Victory there's no there's no right it's just one trial and if you notice those type of people they go from one trial to another trial another Tri Tri and they never come out of the trial why because they're under that influence s we got to cut off for that amen if there's a curse the Holy Ghost C the curse amen there's a curse that is keeping the blessing of Goden get down to your knees Lord what is it I Surrender I confess my sin Lord I want to understand I I want to know my position and that's the only way I know that I can have real faith is to know my position in Christ that's faith is that right the believer's position in Christ now brother and sister when when you say I haven't done this I haven't done that right then Satan has got your blessing you come and then when when we preach against being in that condition people get mad and say oh you're just trying to show them Victory not defeat he says you can't get it the blessing as long as Satan makes you think that if we would listen such things as Temptations like that and would pay attention to them then it would be that we would miss the blessing and that shows you when Satan is trying to block you from something that's right keep on going regardless then he says Satan was trying to block Abraham and Sarah because he knew there was an Angelic visitation coming and and then when everything Rises out out of order then we know something's wrong I believe if we would have listen to Satan we might miss seeing it like Sarah did miss the you know why I read the quote some Services ago he said Sarah had a wrong attitude and brother M said if you come to church with the wrong attitude won't get nothing Sarah was in bad new now Abraham has me strangers that's right Abraham coming this is our visitation it good right Sarah was in a bad attitude and she missed and and brother brother when when Elohim says something o you see what I'm saying when I have a child he doesn't know I'm 19 years old you see it's the same thing huj I believe that same Angel is here he speaking he's saying but if you're not in the right Channel and you're and you're feeling condemned I haven't done this and I haven't done that and I'm this and I'm frustrated you're going to miss it going to miss it he's fighting the blessings every time we come to service he's fighting the blessing but what did Jacob do he fought for the blessing wrestled with the angel Hallelujah he said I will not let you go until you bless me Hallelujah and he took a hold of him he grabbed him he wrestled with him hallelujah oh brother that same Angel is here tonight you can clb a you can wrestle for life tonight Hallelujah God do you see it do you see it Hallelujah musicians come brother and sister I believe that same Angel is here tonight and brother says Sarah being in that condition see she was kind of a little fussy that morning she might have said Abraham you know our supplies are getting low and our herdsmen all their pasture is dead dried up I think you have made the wrong decision when you chose to come up here look at Mrs lot and their family they are living in plenty wowow that's what Sarah was saying that morning wow look at's wife at oh she just got a new cars she dresses nice God is blessing and there the angel is right in their camp in human flesh and she's looking somewhere else sister that angel is here tonight if you can believe hallelujah hallelujah you can believe yeah if you can say Lord I come to you Lord I Surrender myself and I know Lord that all these trials and all these things that I go through fighting the blessing so I won't receive Lord let me not look to Sodom to the cardal church the church down in prospering that's okay but that's not where we're placing our eyes amen
