[10:21] Christ amen and amen amen you may be
[10:26] seated amen hallelujah
[10:33] brother Bram
[10:38] said the message why little
[10:42] Bethlehem amen I'll give you my title in
[10:45] a
[10:47] second but he said here in the message
[10:49] why little
[10:51] Bethlehem how is that
[10:54] David he was once a little
[10:57] boy how God dealt with
[11:00] him God led him and many different
[11:04] things he saw God
[11:07] delivered he saw God do many
[11:11] things he he says how that
[11:14] David he could
[11:16] remember when he sang
[11:20] Praises in his childhood
[11:22] days when he heard the sheep
[11:26] and and he he was remembering back
[11:30] there he would carry the shepherd
[11:34] staff and give me back my herd of sheep
[11:37] let me
[11:40] alone and back there to worship
[11:43] you and sometimes we
[11:47] think we think that we think that God
[11:51] has been
[11:53] left back there in those
[11:57] days but we find and we
[12:00] realize that we are in the heat of the
[12:05] battle and something has got to be
[12:08] done we were once
[12:11] boys like they
[12:13] was but we're growing up men
[12:16] now now it's not time to do the things
[12:21] that we did as back
[12:24] then the fight is
[12:27] on and I remember when the saw dust
[12:31] Trails boiled upon the
[12:35] floor the people screamed and
[12:38] shouted and you couldn't even get around
[12:40] the
[12:41] place nowhere amen amen and you and
[12:46] nowhere here for the people because but
[12:48] it's not that way
[12:51] today see the battle is
[12:54] on the battle has come the battle is
[12:58] Raging
[13:00] oh it's not William brandham William the
[13:02] little boy preacher
[13:05] anymore you've got to produce
[13:08] something yes sir there's got to be
[13:11] something
[13:12] different the time is on the battle is
[13:17] on the heat is on and the
[13:21] powers to be
[13:23] delivered the people Everyone that is
[13:26] found written in the book
[13:30] now the time has
[13:32] come amen amen in the time of the heat
[13:35] of the
[13:36] battle amen is when something has got to
[13:40] produce
[13:41] itself brother Bram said I can read many
[13:45] more
[13:46] quotes amen amen where brother Bram
[13:50] continues to say the same
[13:53] thing and it's now that we have to
[13:57] realize that what what we are facing in
[14:00] this
[14:01] hour what the challenge that has
[14:04] come the
[14:06] enemy amen is coming with full
[14:09] force he's coming with an
[14:11] attack amen and the time has come amen
[14:15] for the
[14:17] manifestation of the sons of God to show
[14:20] forth what God has been laying in his in
[14:24] his church all these
[14:26] years whatever he has planted
[14:30] what he has been giving us what he has
[14:33] taught us what he has revealed to us
[14:37] what he has shown Us in his
[14:39] word what he has spoke to us amen by the
[14:44] different
[14:45] Ministry what we have heard from the
[14:47] message all these things that have been
[14:51] planted into our
[14:53] hearts by
[14:55] Revelation now the time has come that
[14:58] these things must give a a
[15:02] product it must
[15:04] manifest it's the time to
[15:08] produce what has been given to us in
[15:10] this
[15:12] hour amen that's exactly what the
[15:14] prophet of
[15:16] God is saying here in that
[15:18] quote comparing it with
[15:21] David and then showing his own
[15:24] life amen how God dealt with
[15:27] him in the early
[15:30] years and how there was a great
[15:32] wonderful
[15:33] time but then there come a time of the
[15:37] heat of a
[15:38] battle amen amen and when we don't
[15:41] realize
[15:42] brothers that God has prepared us for
[15:45] this time we won't
[15:48] realize what's already in
[15:51] you for this
[15:55] battle in other words God has already
[15:58] prepared you
[16:00] Amen to face the challenge of this
[16:04] hour but the Bible says amen that many
[16:09] think and we've preached on this
[16:12] before the Bible says it in many places
[16:14] in
[16:16] ecclesiastics it says it in Isaiah it
[16:19] says it even in the New
[16:20] Testament that say not that the times of
[16:24] old were better than
[16:27] these amen for brother bam taught us as
[16:31] well that this day is where we have to
[16:35] open our
[16:36] eyes to see what God is doing in this
[16:40] hour you see the the one that is wanting
[16:44] an easy way or easy
[16:48] Road amen he is not
[16:51] looking Amen to Bear the reproach of
[16:55] Christ during the time when
[16:59] things are
[17:01] harder amen than there's ever
[17:04] been because brother bam
[17:07] said in during that time when those
[17:11] things were taking
[17:12] place like we said the other
[17:15] day uh they asked him the question amen
[17:19] how why is it harder to
[17:21] pray in this day than it was years
[17:25] ago and he said it's because the spirit
[17:29] of God is leaving the
[17:32] Earth amen and he said the
[17:36] Revival that was once
[17:39] on is no longer there amen that's what
[17:43] the prophet said he also said in the
[17:46] resume of the church
[17:48] ages when the prophet is speaking about
[17:51] the false
[17:52] teachers that was going to come in the
[17:55] last
[17:56] days brother bam said this
[17:59] now this like I said many times we think
[18:03] that one thing contradicts the
[18:05] other but it doesn't brother bam said in
[18:10] that message exposition of church ages
[18:14] he said that men would
[18:15] come after the
[18:18] message after the
[18:20] messenger and they would rise up and
[18:23] they would tell the people that
[18:26] Revival is here when the prophet has
[18:29] already
[18:30] said Revival is
[18:33] over I heard brother Bram say that
[18:36] brother said they are wolves and sheep's
[18:40] clothing amen amen the thing is we've
[18:43] got to understand and
[18:45] realize what season we're
[18:48] in there's different
[18:51] seasons and if we don't understand that
[18:54] we don't understand God's nature we
[18:57] don't understand God's plan
[19:00] when you look at nature and the
[19:02] natural amen you understand that there's
[19:05] Seasons there's a time of
[19:07] abundance there's a time of
[19:10] cold there's a time where there's a lot
[19:12] of
[19:13] abundance and there's times when there's
[19:16] not is that right there's time when the
[19:19] climate is
[19:20] nice and there's times when it's not
[19:22] that
[19:23] nice but the thing is that we've got to
[19:27] adapt to whatever the conditions
[19:30] are and know that during that
[19:33] time God still has
[19:36] control of all things amen amen you
[19:40] don't want to expect summer and
[19:43] winter if you if winter comes you know
[19:46] it's
[19:47] winter amen you know it's that season
[19:50] you know it's that time you know it's
[19:53] that that time has come
[19:55] around amen amen and the thing is we
[19:58] don't realize
[20:00] that amen we fail to
[20:03] understand what God wants to
[20:06] do hallelujah amen amen what God wants
[20:11] to do what he wants to give
[20:14] us what he wants to teach
[20:16] us what he wants to show
[20:20] us because we're too
[20:22] busy wanting something
[20:25] else you see and we we cannot be
[20:30] selfish in the kingdom of God it's not
[20:33] what you want it's what God
[20:37] wants amen hallelujah but a selfish
[20:42] person will say I like this this is how
[20:44] I like
[20:46] it and this is how I want it and this is
[20:50] how I like it and this is how I want it
[20:52] to be and if it isn't this way then
[20:56] something is wrong you got to understand
[20:59] brother and sister that the spirit of
[21:02] God will lead you through rough
[21:08] valleys the spirit of God brother says
[21:12] will take you into rough
[21:16] valleys amen The Same Spirit that leads
[21:21] you to
[21:22] victories the same spirit of God that
[21:25] leads you to a great Mountain
[21:30] experience amen it's the same God that
[21:34] is holding your
[21:35] hand when you go down into the valley
[21:39] it's not a different God it's the same
[21:41] God
[21:43] hallelujah amen amen and we've got to
[21:47] understand that a true Son of God a true
[21:51] daughter of God Abraham's Royal
[21:54] seed will stand for the
[21:57] word no matter what they feel no matter
[22:01] what they see no matter what they hear
[22:04] no matter what they taste hallelujah
[22:07] hallelujah it doesn't
[22:09] matter amen these five
[22:13] senses amen have to come in subjection
[22:16] to the word of
[22:18] God glory to God amen amen so when we
[22:24] look at the scriptures that we have read
[22:27] tonight
[22:29] we kind of
[22:30] see the pattern of it
[22:33] amen how many can see
[22:36] itlu we read in Isaiah
[22:41] 54
[22:43] that
[22:46] God this is a beautiful
[22:49] scripture because he is
[22:54] promising that there that we will be far
[22:59] from
[23:00] oppression you will not
[23:02] fear amen amen then he
[23:06] says amen that though the
[23:10] enemy uh comes and gathers itself
[23:13] against you verse
[23:16] 15 amen they will not they're they're
[23:20] doing it not by by the Lord and
[23:24] whosoever Shall Gather together against
[23:26] thee shall fall for thy sake
[23:31] behold I have created the Smith now
[23:34] listen what God is saying
[23:35] here listen verse look at this verse 16
[23:39] here I have created the
[23:43] Smith amen amen that bloweth the Coes in
[23:48] the
[23:49] fire in other words God created man in
[23:54] his own
[23:56] image and when he made the
[23:59] Smith amen he is
[24:02] showing an
[24:04] attribute of himself is that right what
[24:08] did Brother bam say Amen what does a
[24:11] Smith do when it's when he puts whatever
[24:16] metal that he is
[24:19] forming he he puts it in the fire and he
[24:22] takes it out and then he beats it
[24:25] hallelujah amen sometimes he takes us
[24:28] out of the fire and we think
[24:31] Hallelujah the Lord is saving
[24:34] me amen but no he's taking you out of
[24:38] the fire to beat you
[24:41] some and then to put you back in the
[24:46] fire amen is that right yes sir you said
[24:52] oh God help me I'm in the fire he takes
[24:56] you out of the fire beat
[24:59] yourself what did he beat you with with
[25:02] the hammer of his
[25:03] word and other words he want you
[25:07] understand this is the reason
[25:11] why my word says this my word says this
[25:17] I'm molding you into my image amen amen
[25:22] and then he says you understand now okay
[25:26] here you go back in the
[25:30] fire you understand we've got to
[25:33] understand those things why
[25:37] because when we don't understand
[25:40] oppression
[25:41] comes depression
[25:44] comes amen
[25:46] feelings that are not of God brother bam
[25:49] said those Spirits are of the
[25:52] devil depression is of the devil it's
[25:54] not of
[25:56] God amen amen
[25:58] amen the thing
[26:01] is that when we don't
[26:03] understand
[26:05] then we will through the whole
[26:09] process it still won't
[26:12] work amen now listen what he says cre
[26:16] the Smith and then he says and that
[26:18] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[26:21] work and I have
[26:23] created the the the the wter to destroy
[26:34] see Hallelujah no
[26:37] weapon that is formed against thee
[26:40] Hallelujah shall
[26:45] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[26:47] against thee in judge me Thou shalt
[26:48] condemn this is the heritage of the
[26:50] Servants of the Lord and the
[26:51] righteousness of Me sayth
[26:57] Lord
[27:01] now in Romans
[27:03] 8
[27:05] Paul says in verse
[27:08] 28 all
[27:12] things works together for
[27:16] good for
[27:20] who to
[27:23] them who are
[27:26] called Accord
[27:28] according to his
[27:32] purpose amen
[27:34] amen and then he shows
[27:37] you that the purpose of
[27:41] God is this for whom he didn't for know
[27:45] he
[27:48] predestinated to be what
[27:52] formed Hallelujah
[27:54] conform to the
[27:57] image
[27:58] of his
[28:00] son you understand that he might be the
[28:03] first born of many
[28:06] Brethren then those who he
[28:09] predestinated he called so if you're
[28:13] called according to his purpose you're
[28:17] predestinated because those he called he
[28:21] predestinated you understand Hallelujah
[28:24] then he
[28:25] says and Those whom he called
[28:29] he called them why cuz they were
[28:33] predestinated and the ones that he
[28:35] called because they were
[28:38] predestinated he
[28:41] justified amen you never did it in the
[28:43] first
[28:45] place and then them who he does that too
[28:50] by the blood of the Lamb take your book
[28:54] take your name amen out of The Book of
[28:57] Life
[28:59] and castes the
[29:01] Book of your deeds in the sea of
[29:05] forgetfulness hallelujah amen glory them
[29:09] he also
[29:12] glorified see Hallelujah and he says
[29:15] what shall we then say to these
[29:21] things Amen to what things to what he
[29:24] just
[29:25] said amen amen y if God be for
[29:30] us who could be against
[29:33] us you understand in other words if God
[29:36] is in control of Our
[29:38] Lives what are you afraid of Hallelujah
[29:42] he's the one that's leading you he's the
[29:44] one that called you he's the one that
[29:47] predestinated you he's the one that
[29:49] justified you glory to God it doesn't
[29:53] matter what anybody else says things or
[29:57] done

[37:16] story brother Bram says here there's a
[37:21] perfect
[37:22] way and there's a permissive

[37:31] that has
[37:32] been and in my rooms and so
[37:35] forth he is able to tell me just what he
[37:39] wants me and what he wants me to
[37:42] do where he wants me but I feel that as
[37:47] long as I got it all hooked
[37:51] up I feel like
[37:54] then he won't put his hands on it
[37:59] as long as I'm doing
[38:02] it that's the way it is anything as long
[38:06] as you're doing going to do
[38:10] it if somebody talks about
[38:15] you you talk back about
[38:19] them God can't fight your
[38:24] battle oh my hm

[1:29:53] else stand still brother bam says I want
[1:29:57] to read a portion of
[1:29:59] scripture to give a word or
[1:30:02] two second
[1:30:04] chronicles 20 verse
[1:30:08] 17 that's what we read and he says I
[1:30:12] want to use this for a
[1:30:13] text stand still and see the salvation
[1:30:17] of the
[1:30:18] lord we are so
[1:30:22] acquainted these
[1:30:24] scriptures in this day that we're
[1:30:27] living we see listen to this
[1:30:31] church is there such a hustle and a
[1:30:35] bustle of the people how people are just
[1:30:38] going from place to
[1:30:41] place and they're
[1:30:44] driving amen not knowing where they're
[1:30:47] going caring
[1:30:50] less and ramming into each other
[1:30:54] and
[1:30:55] Wrecking it seems to be a neurotic
[1:30:59] age it's time I
[1:31:02] think that we
[1:31:05] all Stood
[1:31:06] Still just for a little while and take
[1:31:11] inventory of where we are
[1:31:14] going now in this particular
[1:31:18] scripture that we just
[1:31:20] read it was where a great Christ had
[1:31:26] come see what he says in the scripture
[1:31:30] that we have just read it was where a
[1:31:33] great
[1:31:35] crisis had come the people were all
[1:31:40] nervous
[1:31:42] upset because there was a great invading
[1:31:46] Army the
[1:31:48] moabites were coming against
[1:31:51] Judah and it was a strous
[1:31:58] time and the people were all
[1:32:02] frustrated they didn't know which way to
[1:32:05] go
[1:32:07] Jehoshaphat the righteous man of God he
[1:32:11] tried to do
[1:32:12] everything he knew how to serve the
[1:32:15] Lord and the people were all tore
[1:32:19] up because there was a great invading
[1:32:22] Army so many times that we all get to a
[1:32:27] place where we can stand still and
[1:32:31] nervous just as we start to do something
[1:32:35] good then we see trouble
[1:32:38] coming but that is the devil trying to
[1:32:43] accept the program of
[1:32:46] God and we find it in our individual
[1:32:51] lives we find it in our
[1:32:55] church and we find it in the
[1:32:59] nation amen
[1:33:01] amen did you hear
[1:33:04] that stand to your feet
[1:33:10] tonight Hallelujah glor
[1:33:15] beautiful
[1:33:19] amen you find it
[1:33:21] everywhere we can know that when we are
[1:33:23] getting ready to do
[1:33:26] right wrong is always
[1:33:30] present but the way to overcome
[1:33:33] that is to think in your
[1:33:35] heart which way God will have you to
[1:33:40] go which is the best way then stay with
[1:33:45] that and stay
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:50] there so in that great hour of
[1:33:55] frustration the Lord
[1:33:57] spoke and he spoke through a little
[1:34:01] Prophet standing near who said stand
[1:34:06] still and see the salvation of
[1:34:09] God you'll not have to fight this
[1:34:13] battle but as long as they were together
[1:34:17] and
[1:34:20] praying God was going to fight the
[1:34:26] battle and I think the same
[1:34:29] thing applies
[1:34:32] tonight in this great
[1:34:35] hour where the church
[1:34:38] people are
[1:34:41] doing fing with each
[1:34:44] other breaking us up we battle from this
[1:34:48] side to the
[1:34:50] other it's time to stand still
[1:34:54] it's God's battle it's not ours to begin
[1:34:59] with God wants us to stand
[1:35:02] still when God gets ready to do
[1:35:07] anything
[1:35:09] usually most all the time he commands
[1:35:14] his
[1:35:15] people to stand
[1:35:19] still hallelujah hallelujah amen when he
[1:35:23] was going to open the Red
[1:35:25] Sea and the enemy was coming he told him
[1:35:30] amen told
[1:35:32] Moses
[1:35:33] speak amen and people
[1:35:37] CES to do die there was graves in
[1:35:43] Egypt there was
[1:35:45] Graves we could have had a formal
[1:35:50] funeral
[1:35:52] better
[1:35:56] amen hallelujah he said stand
[1:36:01] still and see the
[1:36:04] salvation of the Lord amen amen when the
[1:36:09] enemy was gaining
[1:36:11] ground in the in the promised land and
[1:36:15] Joshua needed more
[1:36:18] time he said
[1:36:20] Son stand
[1:36:22] still hallelujah hallelujah and see the
[1:36:26] salvation of the Lord Amen brother says
[1:36:32] every time that God gets ready to do
[1:36:37] anything a
[1:36:39] paradox He commands his
[1:36:42] people to stand
[1:36:44] still and see the salvation of the
[1:36:47] Lord how many know that every time the
[1:36:52] prophet used
[1:36:54] the third
[1:36:55] pool he told him to
[1:36:58] stand glory to God
[1:37:02] stand
[1:37:04] stand
[1:37:06] stand
[1:37:08] amen hallelujah hallelujah he was
[1:37:11] praying in the
[1:37:13] tree he told him to stand he was praying
[1:37:17] in the
[1:37:18] wilderness amen and the storm is getting
[1:37:21] ready to come down
[1:37:24] he told him to stand he was in the
[1:37:27] boat fishing with banks and L
[1:37:30] Woods wood he told him to stand up he
[1:37:34] was praying in his home and he told him
[1:37:37] to stand up amen amen every time he used
[1:37:42] the third pole he was preaching the
[1:37:45] Seven
[1:37:46] Seals and seven Thunders were uttering
[1:37:49] their
[1:37:50] voices he was
[1:37:52] standing the
[1:37:54] platform behind the pulpit every time he
[1:37:58] use the third P he will
[1:38:02] standing amen stand
[1:38:05] still and see the
[1:38:08] salvation of the
[1:38:10] Lord am God is going to perform a
[1:38:14] paradox amen you got to stand
[1:38:17] still amen amen if God is going to
[1:38:20] perform something in the message I have
[1:38:23] heard but now I
[1:38:25] see brother bam says it's in the hour of
[1:38:30] Crisis same thing he said in the other
[1:38:33] message this scene right here in second
[1:38:36] chronicles it was an hour of
[1:38:39] Crisis amen amen in the times of Moses
[1:38:44] when he come to the Red Sea it was in
[1:38:46] the time of
[1:38:48] Crisis that we find inspiration struck
[1:38:52] them
[1:38:54] amen amen and God hadn't even spoke to
[1:38:57] him
[1:39:00] yet
[1:39:02] hallu glory to God God what the prophet
[1:39:07] is God hadn't even spoke to him
[1:39:12] yet he hadn't gave him
[1:39:14] instructions he hadn't told him nothing
[1:39:18] but
[1:39:19] inspiration struck him in the hour of
[1:39:22] Christ
[1:39:24] and he said stand still and see the
[1:39:28] salvation of
[1:39:30] God oh my hallelujah amen amen glory to
[1:39:36] God coming to the Red
[1:39:38] Sea
[1:39:40] Joshua he also
[1:39:42] says in the hour of
[1:39:45] Crisis Hallelujah in the message I have
[1:39:47] heard but now I
[1:39:49] see Joshua was in the hour of crisis
[1:39:54] when the armies were routed the sun was
[1:39:56] going
[1:39:58] down josu was a prophet he knew that the
[1:40:02] armies he knew that if the
[1:40:05] armies never had a chance to
[1:40:08] unite would lose more men and in the
[1:40:11] hour of Crisis there was only one thing
[1:40:16] he had to keep them
[1:40:17] running but there wasn't enough lot to
[1:40:20] do it so Joshua stood and raised his
[1:40:25] and he said Son stand still and moon
[1:40:29] hang over Ed
[1:40:31] of till I get through with this battle
[1:40:35] and the sun Stood
[1:40:37] Still
[1:40:39] inspiration struck him before that God
[1:40:43] spoke to
[1:40:44] him amen hallelujah said the reason they
[1:40:49] do that is because they knew their
[1:40:52] Commission brother bam said didn't have
[1:40:56] to pray he didn't say Lord can I do this
[1:41:01] he was in the line of duty amen he was
[1:41:05] in the line of duty he had been raised
[1:41:08] up for that
[1:41:10] purpose he was in the will of God he was
[1:41:13] in the Battle of the
[1:41:15] Lord amen amen he could
[1:41:18] command in the line of duty to the
[1:41:22] inspiration stru
[1:41:24] and he said Son stand still it's in the
[1:41:28] hour of
[1:41:29] Crisis amen that
[1:41:32] Jehosaphat was crying to God and was
[1:41:36] saying Lord God Amen what will you do he
[1:41:40] got the attention of God and this little
[1:41:44] Prophet as we just read in the message
[1:41:47] came out and said amen
[1:41:52] Jael he he came out and he said amen
[1:41:56] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:42:00] Lord go out
