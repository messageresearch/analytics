[0:00] from the book of
[0:02] Acts chapter
[0:06] 13 we read from
[0:13] verse
[0:15] amen verse
[0:19] 40
[0:28] reading
[0:37] 49 verse 52 I'm
[0:41] sorrys chapter
[0:44] 13 all have it
[0:47] tonight verse
[0:50] 40 says beware
[0:53] therefore Le that that come upon you
[0:56] which is spoken in the prophets
[1:06] and wonder perish my work of work in
[1:10] your days of work ye shall no wise
[1:25] [Music]
[1:28] believe this is
[1:33] Paul
[1:35] preaching in
[1:38] Antioch to the
[1:41] Jews is letting them
[1:44] know that the
[1:47] work of the holy
[1:49] spirit is in
[1:52] continuation and the son of
[1:55] man into the
[1:58] body and that
[2:01] work that was done
[2:06] Amen in the Lord Jesus
[2:09] Christ he was the one that David spoke
[2:13] of he was the one that Moses spoke
[2:16] of he was the one that Isaiah spoke of
[2:20] all of these
[2:21] prophecies spoke of him yet the Jews are
[2:26] blind yet they cannot see it
[2:30] and in the book of
[2:32] Acts we find that there was
[2:35] many of the
[2:37] Jews that followed the
[2:40] church they were following the
[2:43] church uh they were added to the
[2:47] church Bible even says a few chapters
[2:51] down that there were some of the
[2:56] Pharisees that had believed
[2:58] also in the
[3:00] gospel but uh they were still
[3:04] Pharisees and later on they show their
[3:09] colors but we're what we're looking at
[3:12] tonight as we open the
[3:15] scripture we're seeing
[3:17] Paul bringing the
[3:20] word to the
[3:22] Jews this was one of the
[3:24] last
[3:26] uh
[3:28] messages
[3:30] that Paul is giving directly to the
[3:35] Jews amen and of course we read where he
[3:39] is
[3:41] quoting the book of habac chapter
[3:46] one amen where it is
[3:51] prophesied what he quoted there amen
[3:55] amen I work a work in your
[3:58] days
[4:00] a work which ye in no wise will
[4:03] believe though a man declared
[4:08] un verse
[4:10] 42 and when the Jews were gone out of
[4:13] the synagogue the Gentiles besought that
[4:16] these
[4:17] words might be preached to them the next
[4:28] s
[4:30] so there was some Gentiles there that
[4:32] heard
[4:34] this and while the more these Jews
[4:39] heard you see many Jews had
[4:43] believed brother mam said the body of
[4:47] Christ is
[4:48] composed of Jews and
[4:51] Gentiles so that early
[4:54] church that had Peter and James and
[4:57] John they were Jews
[5:00] amen they reive the Holy Spirit they
[5:03] believed the sign of the
[5:05] Messiah they followed the word they were
[5:08] in the
[5:10] continuity of the work of
[5:14] God of
[5:16] course that in that group there was a
[5:20] lot of unbelief as
[5:22] well in that Exodus out of law into the
[5:28] dispensation of
[5:31] Grace amen there was a lot of
[5:34] unbelief just like in the first Exodus
[5:37] with
[5:38] Moses so not all that was following
[5:42] them not everybody that was with the
[5:45] church just been called out were fully
[5:51] Believers
[5:53] Amen on the day of
[5:55] Pentecost
[5:57] 120 that was all SE
[6:01] amen but as it continued
[6:04] on there was many that were
[6:07] added like we have pointed out some were
[6:10] added to the
[6:11] church some were added to the
[6:14] Lord there's a difference that's why
[6:17] brother Bon
[6:19] preached against just being a church
[6:23] member amen you're added to the church
[6:25] that's
[6:26] fine we we should have a church should
[6:30] have but we must
[6:33] belong to One Church to one body amen
[6:38] and that's the body of Jesus
[6:40] Christ so we read here verse 43
[6:45] now and now when the congregation was
[6:48] broken
[6:50] up
[6:52] amen many of the Jews and religious
[6:56] prelit followed Paul and Barnabas
[7:00] who speaking to them persuade them to
[7:03] continue in the grace of
[7:21] God the next Sabbath day came almost the
[7:24] whole city together
[7:28] toar
[7:32] but when the Jews saw the
[7:35] multitudes were filled
[7:37] with and spake against those things
[7:40] which were spoken by Paul
[7:43] contradicted and
[7:55] Blas then Paul and
[7:58] Barnabas wax
[8:00] bold and said it was necessary that the
[8:05] word of God should have first been
[8:08] spoken to you but seeing he put it from
[8:13] you judge yourselves
[8:16] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[8:21] to the
[8:22] Gentiles so for so for for so ha the
[8:27] Lord commanded us saying
[8:29] I have sent thee to be the light of the
[8:32] Gentiles that thou should us be for
[8:36] salvation
[8:58] of
[9:08] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[9:11] were glad and glorified the word of the
[9:13] Lord as many as were ordained to eternal
[9:18] life
[9:28] believe
[9:30] amen how many believe in
[9:33] predestination the Bible speaks of it
[9:35] amen and this early
[9:38] church these early
[9:43] Believers were ordained to eternal
[9:46] life and the word of the Lord was
[9:48] published throughout all the
[9:53] region but the Jews stirred up The
[9:57] Devout and honorable woman
[10:00] and the chief men of the city and raised
[10:03] persecution against PA Barnabas and
[10:05] expelled him out of their
[10:18] host but they shook off the dust with
[10:20] their feet against them that that's what
[10:23] Jesus told him to do and came
[10:27] unto ion
[10:35] the disciples were filled with joy
[10:41] yes amen the Lord the bless to the of
[10:53] [Music]
[10:55] word
[10:58] so
[11:03] reason I have chosen this part in the
[11:06] book of
[11:08] Acts being that we've been on
[11:11] this this
[11:14] teaching looking at
[11:16] this and seeing
[11:19] how we are
[11:24] exactly uh as the church was
[11:27] then after the ministry of the son of
[11:31] man then as we ended uh
[11:36] Sunday if you
[11:38] remember just to kind of pick it up back
[11:40] where we
[11:42] left we
[11:45] established through the the
[11:48] word and we want to pick it up
[11:51] there where the the church
[11:55] today right today us the Believers
[12:00] we are in the exact
[12:03] place
[12:05] scripturally amen as the church was in
[12:09] the book of
[12:10] Acts that's what Malachi 4 AM was going
[12:14] to
[12:15] do that is the
[12:18] product that is the
[12:21] result of brother br's
[12:24] Ministry
[12:26] amen and when we look at it
[12:30] a lot of
[12:31] times we have already
[12:33] said uh when
[12:36] we when we
[12:39] unconsciously
[12:42] interpret what brother
[12:43] bam
[12:46] meant when you said Christ in the true
[12:50] church is the continuation of the book
[12:52] of
[12:53] act we unconsciously interpret that as
[12:57] signs wonders and just a good
[13:03] time and that's what we think the book
[13:05] of Acts is
[13:07] about or that's what we think brother R
[13:10] meant when he said the book of
[13:13] Acts but if we take the book of
[13:17] Acts in its entire
[13:19] context as I believe the Holy Spirit has
[13:22] helped us
[13:24] already to see that this is the body
[13:28] that is speaking
[13:30] is not focused on one
[13:32] church not focused on one
[13:36] Ministry this writer
[13:39] Luke showing the
[13:42] diversity of the different members in
[13:44] the
[13:45] body different gifts in the
[13:47] body and different operations of the
[13:50] Holy
[13:52] Spirit through that one
[13:55] body under the one head which is Christ
[13:59] Amen brother bam said that's true
[14:04] Oneness amen that's God the Holy
[14:08] Spirit In You operating his
[14:12] word amen that's why Jesus pray let them
[14:16] be one
[14:17] father as you and I are
[14:21] one said that's the only way we can be
[14:25] one amen is that in first
[14:29] I become one with the
[14:31] Lord you become one with the Lord we are
[14:35] part of the his body then we find our
[14:39] place in the
[14:40] body and the body is not
[14:43] separated the body is all jointed
[14:46] together it's all connected it's all
[14:49] working for the same
[14:51] purpose it's all working under the Same
[14:54] Spirit the same
[14:57] intelligence the same head is
[15:00] controlling the whole
[15:01] body amen that's that's the
[15:05] reality of the book of Acts now you got
[15:08] to keep in mind
[15:10] something that when we're looking at the
[15:12] whole book of
[15:14] Acts
[15:15] this it expands more than 30
[15:20] years from acts one to acts
[15:24] 28 amen acts
[15:27] 27 um
[15:29] this is an expansion of
[15:32] time in
[15:33] which is showing us the history of the
[15:37] church amen and within the book of
[15:42] Acts Luke is picking up only some of the
[15:48] things of the history of the
[15:52] church in other words he speaks of the
[15:55] Corinthian Church in the book of
[15:57] Acts
[16:00] but he does not he doesn't he doesn't
[16:03] write about how they did not have the
[16:05] gifts in
[16:09] order amen does it speak of how Paul
[16:13] went and had to set them in order by the
[16:18] word we read that in the letter that
[16:21] Paul wrote to the
[16:24] Corinthians in other words Luke is just
[16:27] outlining the whole
[16:33] history amen of the
[16:35] church we know that there's a book of
[16:40] James right he wrote his
[16:43] epistle well in the book of Acts we see
[16:46] that James is
[16:50] martyred he's
[16:53] beheaded amen the book of we read that
[16:58] what tell you that tells you that the
[17:00] epist of James over
[17:03] here amen was
[17:06] written within the book of
[17:08] Acts you understand what I'm saying all
[17:12] of the Epistles of
[17:15] Paul amen his his first
[17:19] letter amen was to the
[17:23] Thessalonians amen the first book Paul
[17:26] ever wrote
[17:29] the first letter he ever
[17:31] wrote was it
[17:33] Romans although Romans is put as the
[17:37] first one of
[17:39] his
[17:41] after but the first one he wrote was
[17:45] T according to history and according to
[17:48] the
[17:49] time according to the book
[17:52] of well when we
[17:54] see amen what he wrote in Thessalonians
[17:59] we see the great mystery amen we see our
[18:03] day spoke of
[18:06] am he wrote to all of these what I'm
[18:10] trying to say
[18:11] is is we're not just reading the or
[18:15] we're not just looking at the book of
[18:19] Acts as some little thing that happened
[18:23] here and then all the rest of the
[18:26] Epistles was in some other time
[18:30] no no all the
[18:32] Epistles were
[18:34] written except a
[18:37] few like uh first
[18:42] John
[18:44] Revelations those were written
[18:48] out but the majority of the Epistles in
[18:51] the new
[18:53] test were written
[18:57] in the
[19:04] understand what I'm
[19:06] saying hallelujah
[19:08] so this is how we're looking at
[19:13] the we're looking at the book of
[19:16] Acts as the entirety of the New
[19:20] Testament
[19:23] Church in other words within the book of
[19:27] Acts Paul was the
[19:30] messenger amen he was the messenger to
[19:34] the
[19:35] AG he was the
[19:38] prophet he was the one that had the
[19:41] message
[19:44] Hallelujah but there was other
[19:47] Ministries that were also
[19:51] ministering the book of
[19:53] act this is the history of the
[19:56] church outlining
[19:58] many things to us showing
[20:01] us showing us that in this
[20:06] continuation the book of Acts or
[20:09] this uh this new book of
[20:13] Acts another book of
[20:16] Acts the same
[20:18] Works will be
[20:21] done
[20:23] so again picking it
[20:27] up
[20:29] where we have
[20:32] shown
[20:35] remember we quoted it verbatim but I'm
[20:38] going to read some quotes
[20:43] tonight um of
[20:47] how
[20:49] Jesus left the
[20:52] scene Ministry of the son of
[20:54] man in Corporal
[20:57] form
[21:00] back returned in the form of the pillar
[21:02] of
[21:05] fire
[21:07] amen and during this time of the book of
[21:12] Acts he is in working in and through the
[21:22] members to achieve
[21:25] something to do something
[21:29] that is how we've seen
[21:32] already that people were able to
[21:40] notice they had been with
[21:43] Jesus they seen the same things that
[21:46] Jesus
[21:47] did reflecting through his
[21:51] body the same
[21:53] character of Jesus in Steven as he died
[21:58] amen you see the same
[22:00] life of
[22:02] Jesus in Philip being
[22:07] translated by the spirit in other
[22:10] words uh
[22:13] Dimensions
[22:14] walls distance wasn't a
[22:18] factor amen can be translated in the
[22:23] spirit just to get to a
[22:25] un to make them understand the word
[22:29] am amen because God is his own
[22:33] interpreter but brother bam said that
[22:36] unit needed a
[22:39] guide the message of guide says he
[22:43] needed a
[22:44] guide to lead him to understand what
[22:48] Isaiah 53 is speaking
[22:51] of amen and the God is the holy
[22:55] spirit but he was giving his word
[22:59] word and his
[23:01] direction through his body he also tells
[23:05] us in spoken words The Original
[23:07] Seed you've already quoted this before
[23:11] amen that the
[23:13] seed comes through the
[23:16] body my
[23:18] SE comes through my body do come through
[23:22] my head to my body say so the seat of
[23:26] Christ spoken word is the Original
[23:31] Seed he said it comes through his
[23:37] body he says although they were directed
[23:40] by
[23:41] Angels an angel LED
[23:44] Peter to cornelius's house is that right
[23:49] he said but the seed came through
[23:52] Peter word receive the Holy
[23:56] Ghost angel LED
[23:58] Philip Amen to the UN but the seed came
[24:02] to the
[24:03] body amen hallelujah so this is I
[24:10] believe a tremendous
[24:14] thing so the reason I chose this reading
[24:17] tonight within the book of
[24:20] Acts is because here we are
[24:23] seeing although the Holy Spirit was
[24:26] blasphemed
[24:28] the day of
[24:30] Pentecost God was
[24:33] still fulfilling the words of
[24:36] Jesus go to the lost sheep of
[24:40] Israel you shall be my
[24:43] Witnesses after you receive power from
[24:46] on
[24:47] high not go to the
[24:50] Gentiles
[24:51] before dealing with
[24:56] the you shall be my
[24:59] Witnesses beginning at
[25:02] Jerusalem into Judea and into
[25:06] Samaria and into all the parts of the
[25:10] world so being that that was the words
[25:13] of the Lord Jesus
[25:16] Christ the Holy Spirit directed The
[25:20] Body directed Peter directed the the the
[25:24] the ministry of that
[25:26] day and the church to
[25:31] stay some for some season for a
[25:35] time
[25:37] within the Jews or to the
[25:41] Jews am amen but the time
[25:45] came we read it
[25:47] here where
[25:49] God turned a
[25:52] corner where
[25:54] God listen to me God turn his
[25:58] back to the
[26:01] Jews tells
[26:03] us now look how important this
[26:06] is to
[26:08] identify the work of God in your day
[26:13] amen because to me when I look at this I
[26:19] see the same thing
[26:21] today of how people
[26:24] think how people look at things
[26:28] can you
[26:29] imagine can you imagine these
[26:33] Jews amen they hearing Paul you're
[26:37] hearing
[26:39] Barnabas and Paul is trying to let them
[26:42] know what the work of God is he's
[26:46] identifying it by the
[26:48] scripture he's letting them know by the
[26:51] holy
[26:52] spirit
[26:54] amen and
[26:56] yet amen amen am
[26:59] amen they put it from
[27:05] them
[27:06] amen
[27:08] they don't take
[27:13] he they don't accept the way he's
[27:16] preaching the
[27:18] word amen they have their own
[27:23] ideas what the word is they can't accept
[27:26] it
[27:30] but what I see is
[27:34] this I see
[27:37] jealousy I see
[27:39] Envy in in the
[27:42] Jews I see them despising the
[27:46] word I see them
[27:50] hearing this sermon from
[27:53] Paul and contradicting
[27:56] it
[27:58] a contradictive
[28:02] spirit amen I see the they're
[28:09] blaspheming against what Paul is
[28:13] speaking contradicting what Paul is
[28:17] speaking amen and
[28:20] then the Holy
[28:22] Spirit has to do something now you got
[28:26] to understand
[28:27] that God can
[28:29] only move his
[28:33] work
[28:35] by his in instrumentality of
[28:41] man brother B has taught us that Satan
[28:46] is
[28:47] powerless can't do
[28:49] nothing unless he has
[28:53] somebody that he can
[28:55] work is that right what is going to bind
[28:59] Satan in the
[29:01] Millennium a
[29:03] chain is somebody gonna tie him
[29:07] down said
[29:10] circumstances
[29:12] well
[29:15] Revelations tell us it's a
[29:18] chain that's a symbol
[29:20] right it's a it's a symbol and in this
[29:24] day those symbols have been revealed
[29:29] so we know what that chain
[29:32] mean
[29:35] circumstance well what are the
[29:38] circumstances no the Russians won't be
[29:40] in the
[29:43] Millennium no the Sinners won't be in
[29:45] the
[29:47] Millennium no there won't be nobody in
[29:49] the
[29:51] Millennium that that Satan can work
[29:55] through only
[29:58] bride and 144,000
[30:01] Jews will be in the
[30:03] Millennium
[30:06] with that shows us
[30:10] something that that that
[30:13] indicates that Satan
[30:16] needs
[30:17] somebody to
[30:19] work brother said God
[30:24] does amen God needs his
[30:28] body Amen to continue his
[30:33] work now why am I pointing this
[30:36] out because this is God we're talking
[30:40] about this is the holy spirit we're
[30:42] talking
[30:44] about and God in his heart is
[30:49] choosing to leave the
[30:52] Jews and turn to the
[30:55] genti according to his his
[30:58] desire according to his
[31:01] word he's going to
[31:04] start seven Church
[31:06] ages is g to deal with
[31:10] Gentiles Hallelujah he's gonna
[31:14] stop dealing with
[31:17] Jews he's gonna stop giving his
[31:22] word hear me
[31:25] directly from God
[31:27] a living word to
[31:33] thews
[31:38] right but we notice how
[31:43] it's we notice how
[31:47] God
[31:49] his to
[31:50] the listen how important this is what
[31:54] I'm
[31:56] saying do you think those
[32:00] Jews
[32:02] knew that when Paul and Barnabas turned
[32:04] their
[32:06] back that that was God turning his back
[32:10] on they probably
[32:15] laugh they
[32:17] are do they think they
[32:20] are yeah
[32:23] right be like to the
[32:26] Gentiles
[32:27] you're turning your back on
[32:30] us what I'm saying little did they
[32:42] know wasn't Paul turning his back wasn't
[32:46] Paul and Barnabas turning their
[32:48] back
[32:55] God you see
[32:57] amen why why am I saying that why are we
[33:01] starting there because the same thing is
[33:07] happening yes the world rejected the
[33:09] sign of the
[33:11] Messiah 50
[33:14] years 60 years
[33:17] ago just like they
[33:20] rejected in their
[33:22] days brother Ram said when they when
[33:26] those Jews
[33:28] scream amen for
[33:32] Barnabas no for barabus I'm
[33:35] sorry it
[33:38] was right and they said him what shall
[33:42] we do with Jesus
[33:44] of son of man
[33:51] right let the blood of
[33:53] him be upon
[33:55] us
[34:01] they rejected the son of
[34:06] man religious
[34:11] Jews
[34:13] listen even though they
[34:16] had still wasn't when he turned his back
[34:24] on then the day of Pentecost came
[34:29] he divided his Spirit amongst his
[34:33] people right they acted like drunk
[34:37] people amen they staggered in the
[34:41] spirit brother bam said
[34:44] Peter rose up out of the
[34:48] gutter amen and
[34:52] preached
[34:55] hallelujah amen
[34:57] and
[34:58] people made fun of
[35:01] him people are
[35:03] drunk full of new
[35:06] wine what they've been doing up
[35:10] there what they've been drinking up on
[35:12] there what they have something up
[35:16] there you're getting Lo
[35:18] down
[35:22] am what's going
[35:24] on right Peter said these men are not
[35:28] drunk like
[35:30] you this is the
[35:38] scripture but that even though that
[35:42] was part brother
[35:46] said the angel of
[35:48] Mercy was still
[35:55] seing
[35:57] according amen amen to the Bible the
[36:02] angel of
[36:04] Mercy was still giving salvation to Jews
[36:08] at that
[36:09] time after they had
[36:12] rejected the son of man after they had
[36:15] crucified
[36:16] him after they had made fun of the Holy
[36:20] Ghost you
[36:22] see God is
[36:24] patient God is merciful
[36:28] but there comes a time where he finally
[36:32] says
[36:37] that's and this my brothers and
[36:40] [Music]
[36:43] sisters
[36:45] finally
[36:51] his get what I'm
[36:54] saying
[36:55] said
[36:57] Paul little did they know when Paul
[37:02] said you rejecting the
[37:05] word this word that I'm preaching is
[37:07] nothing to
[37:10] you turn to
[37:15] the this is God's
[37:17] M this is God's
[37:20] Prophet amen amen amen amen when he
[37:25] turned that was God in
[37:29] heaven turning his
[37:33] back
[37:38] message right amen what's going to
[37:41] happen in this last
[37:44] day is God gonna turn his
[37:47] back
[37:50] again he's going to turn his
[37:54] back against the Gentiles
[37:58] he's going to turn his back just like he
[38:00] did
[38:01] here in the book of
[38:11] Acts
[38:18] amen
[38:25] say
[38:28] he that is
[38:31] Holy am amen
[38:34] amen
[38:36] is
[38:43] be that shows us
[38:46] something you understand what we're
[38:48] looking
[38:51] at that God working through his
[38:54] body in the book of act
[39:01] and people rejecting that
[39:13] [Music]
[39:21] word what what do these brothers think
[39:23] they
[39:25] are
[39:31] Israel and the
[39:38] church
[39:42] said notice how perfect that Jesus re
[39:45] rejected of the Jews sent back the Holy
[39:53] Spirit and they laughed at them and made
[39:56] F of
[39:57] them said they're drunk on new
[40:00] wine and Jesus said you can blaspheme
[40:08] me if you speak one word against the
[40:11] Holy
[40:18] Ghost and those Jews come up and
[40:22] said those men are full of new wine
[40:25] haa
[40:29] it's very
[40:31] important brother man taught us a
[40:34] message in
[40:38] 1961 to
[40:41] respect
[40:45] respect in the in the in the series of
[40:48] Revelation chapter
[40:51] 4
[40:54] 2 I believe it was part three I'm not
[40:58] sure brother refers back to
[41:04] Mount where the glory of God would come
[41:07] down on the mountain and shake the
[41:09] mountain
[41:10] amen remember that Exodus
[41:16] 19 and brother benam reads the part in
[41:19] the
[41:21] scripture where the Lord commanded Moses
[41:24] to tell the people
[41:28] they could not touch the
[41:31] mountain not even
[41:36] gaze brother Ram
[41:38] says there's a lot of people today that
[41:42] when that
[41:43] Glory that was on the mountain comes
[41:46] into his people they like to
[41:51] gaze that people in the
[41:54] spirit like to gagee that
[41:58] people brother said you shouldn't do
[42:03] that and the message
[42:06] respects brother Bram
[42:08] said you should have
[42:19] respect if you don't understand it if
[42:22] you don't know what that
[42:25] is
[42:26] that doesn't
[42:37] justify this these people not
[42:43] only
[42:46] rejected or didn't believe
[42:49] in they
[42:55] contradicted
[42:57] but the tremendous thing
[43:00] here is that where finally God turned
[43:03] his back on
[43:06] them as we said after they rejected the
[43:09] son of man after they made fun of the
[43:12] Holy Ghost on the day of
[43:18] Pentecost when God turn his back on
[43:25] you that means that you're at the
[43:29] mercy of the
[43:33] devil you're
[43:36] left Amen to the powers of
[43:40] Satan that's what they were
[43:43] left the
[43:45] Jews were
[43:47] left to the powers of
[43:51] Rome which Satan has always controlled
[43:57] always been an enemy of the
[44:00] [Music]
[44:03] church when God turned his back on
[44:07] them Paul and
[44:09] Barnabas hallelujah
[44:19] hallelujah
[44:21] because amen it was necessary that the
[44:25] word of God
[44:26] should first have been spoken to you
[44:35] amen was
[44:38] necessary but seeing that you put it
[44:40] from
[44:41] me Jud yourselves
[44:44] unworthy everlasting
[44:47] life L we we turn to
[44:52] [Music]
[44:54] thees
[45:04] why because we want
[45:06] to verse
[45:08] 47 for so have the Lord commanded
[45:18] yes saying I
[45:24] have
[45:27] in other words I knew
[45:30] exactly by the leadership of the Holy
[45:33] Spirit now it's time to stop
[45:36] here
[45:38] go turn our
[45:40] back
[45:46] is amen hallelujah but if you keep
[45:50] reading the
[45:54] story
[45:56] oh they kept following
[46:01] Paul they followed
[46:06] him they sred up the people
[46:09] there am
[46:14] am followed him a lot of
[46:17] places they didn't care he said he
[46:21] didn't want have nothing to do with them
[46:22] no
[46:24] more their job was to give them a hard
[46:32] time that just created more miraculous
[46:37] things
[46:42] Amen brother bam says
[46:44] here the holy the Holy Spirit was poured
[46:49] out and they rejected it when the Jews
[46:53] rejected
[46:54] it the Gentiles
[46:59] Reed is that what we
[47:02] read we read right there and when the
[47:05] Gentiles heard this they were glad and
[47:08] glorified the word of the
[47:16] Lord
[47:18] amen mother the
[47:21] discipl with joy amen hallelujah
[47:27] now watch what brother mam
[47:29] says he says they made fun of
[47:34] him and not no more than 30
[47:39] years or
[47:41] better
[47:48] Theus
[47:50] Titus besieged the
[47:53] walls and they ate one another's
[47:56] children and they massacred them and
[47:59] burnt the temple according to God's
[48:04] word and it's never been raised until
[48:08] the days of the Gentiles be
[48:12] Di and there I'm fixing to visit
[48:15] Jerusalem in the next few
[48:18] weeks their old
[48:21] ruins and the Weeping walls
[48:24] there they have been scattered all over
[48:27] the
[48:28] world Amen God told them they would do
[48:33] it and they would come down and did it
[48:39] see because the curse of rejecting the
[48:43] Holy
[48:46] Ghost now watch this next
[48:50] book they asked brother Bram the
[48:53] question what position will the church
[48:56] be
[48:57] in when the
[48:59] gospel returns to the
[49:02] Jews now you understand right God is
[49:05] going to turn his
[49:07] back to the Gentiles and he's going to
[49:10] go back to the Jews and they asked
[49:12] brother
[49:13] Bram what
[49:15] position will the church be in when that
[49:20] happen he said now this person was
[49:24] referring he told me our brother that he
[49:28] was referring to her
[49:30] said the Gentiles will TR the walls of
[49:35] Jerusalem till the Gentile dispensation
[49:38] would be
[49:40] finished now that's in Luke
[49:44] 2124 listen
[49:47] closely beautiful
[49:50] question
[49:52] wonderful reads the scripture and when
[49:55] ye shall see Jerusalem Compass about
[49:58] with armies and know that the Desolation
[50:01] thereof is
[50:07] n now let's catch this close
[50:11] now the Desolation is
[50:15] nigh when you see
[50:18] Jerusalem comp passed around with
[50:21] armies that's been a lot of confusion
[50:24] right there with you people
[50:27] but approaching it from a historical
[50:30] standpoint with the Bible now the Seven
[50:34] Day Adventist
[50:36] Brethren they believe that Jerusalem
[50:39] will again be compassed to B with
[50:43] armies that could be true but scripture
[50:46] has count many many
[50:50] times amen amen
[50:54] now
[50:56] he says now as
[50:58] Jerusalem to pass about with
[51:01] armies but
[51:04] literally
[51:06] historically that was during
[51:11] a96 I'm Prophet questions andw number
[51:16] one literally
[51:19] historically that was during
[51:24] a96
[51:25] when Titus had besieged
[51:28] Jerusalem but now watch this
[51:31] closely you can see you can see the
[51:34] difference
[51:36] Jerusalem will be compassed about with
[51:39] armies again at the end
[51:43] time I
[51:44] [Music]
[51:46] believe well I believe this here was
[51:52] comparing with when Titus besed
[51:57] when the Desolation bear
[52:00] out speaking was when
[52:03] Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy
[52:06] place he said when you see the
[52:08] Abomination that make
[52:11] desolation standing in the Holy Place
[52:15] see Abomination is
[52:19] unan when you see the Abomination that
[52:22] make desolation standing in the Holy
[52:24] place
[52:28] scripturally
[52:30] fulfilled when
[52:33] [Music]
[52:36] tius Titus didn't bese
[52:39] Jerusalem after the day of
[52:42] Pentecost no he did
[52:47] that 30 some years
[52:51] later remember Sunday we quoted to you
[52:54] to show show you where the book of Acts
[52:58] is
[53:00] positioned after the
[53:04] gospels where the son of man revealed
[53:07] himself and
[53:09] before Titus coming to besiege
[53:13] Jerusalem that's where the book of Acts
[53:17] is and if we are in another book of Acts
[53:21] today we are after the revealing of the
[53:24] son of man
[53:26] and
[53:27] before this besieging of Rome is going
[53:31] to come not just upon
[53:35] Jerusalem but the whole
[53:37] world because the
[53:40] target is the bride of Christ to be
[53:44] persecuted and this squeeze brother
[53:48] brand is going to come upon the
[53:51] bride we're the ones that is directed to
[53:56] but we won't be in the
[53:58] tribulation we won't go through the
[54:01] tribulation we won't go through the
[54:04] persecution but we will feel the squeeze
[54:11] amen so here we
[54:15] are
[54:17] am
[54:19] speaking
[54:22] today Bri around the world
[54:27] positionally according to the Bible and
[54:29] the
[54:30] message this is where we're at this is
[54:33] another book of
[54:35] Acts whether we believe it or
[54:38] not whether we understand it or
[54:41] not whether we have our own ideas or
[54:44] about it or
[54:46] not this is where we're
[54:49] at well are we in another book of
[54:52] Acts I think we should see more you know
[54:56] tongues and more this
[55:00] yes but that's not all the book of
[55:04] Acts amen
[55:07] amen understand what I'm
[55:10] say in other words many times it's hard
[55:13] for
[55:15] people or for all of us to see
[55:19] ourselves as the church as the bride
[55:24] that is living
[55:29] the when actually that's exactly what's
[55:36] taking in other words the book of
[55:39] Acts is not going to start when the
[55:43] squeeze
[55:46] starts that would have to be the end of
[55:53] the what I'm saying
[55:55] amen the book of Acts as I said is about
[56:01] well Jesus ascended in
[56:05] 33 that's when the Holy Ghost came
[56:08] down
[56:11] amen and Titus didn't come I just P
[56:16] it until
[56:23] 9697 place you said
[56:28] it shows you how many years was in
[56:31] between
[56:33] understand
[56:36] now in the uniting time in
[56:39] sign brother
[56:44] says that
[56:46] Jesus pointed the
[56:50] church to show
[56:53] them when
[56:55] this
[56:58] sign was going to be upon
[57:01] Jerusalem what to
[57:03] do when that when they would see that
[57:06] sign and brother bam called
[57:09] it national
[57:12] side Jesus
[57:14] pointed to a national
[57:17] sign he was the
[57:19] sign amen and then he spoke that there
[57:23] would be signs in the heaven
[57:28] amen he also said these signs shall
[57:32] follow them
[57:33] that he spoke to many
[57:36] signs but he spoke
[57:39] also of a national
[57:42] sign that was going to come in the
[57:44] future well this
[57:47] ministry that repeated again in this
[57:49] last
[57:50] day of the son of man also pointed us to
[57:55] the same
[57:56] sign he showed us the sign being
[58:01] revealed again of the son of man to the
[58:05] Gentiles he showed
[58:07] us these signs would follow the
[58:10] church amen in my name they shall cast
[58:14] that
[58:15] devil amen they shall take up
[58:18] certain Paul in the book of act they
[58:21] shall not harm
[58:23] them amen amen he he showed us these
[58:27] signs but he also showed us it's coming
[58:31] a national
[58:34] signu now brother bam says here they
[58:38] wanted to know when the end of the
[58:42] world what would be the
[58:45] sign at the end he pointed into to many
[58:48] places through the
[58:50] scripture about National
[58:52] signs about Heavenly signs in the
[58:56] heavens Earthly sign he gave them sign
[59:00] sign and
[59:02] signs just constantly a sign he told
[59:06] them in one place about a national
[59:09] sign he said when you
[59:12] see Nations begin to gather around
[59:18] Jerusalem we know that there's a time of
[59:21] trouble at
[59:22] hand you see Jerusalem compassed about
[59:24] with
[59:26] army before that they could do
[59:29] this the world had to
[59:33] unite that's what the prophet is saying
[59:37] before
[59:38] Titus the great Roman
[59:41] general could unite his armies
[59:44] together the world had to
[59:48] unite after these Jews had
[59:52] rejected their god-given sign
[59:56] of the end time
[59:58] to that that's the time that
[1:00:01] Titus United his
[1:00:04] armies amen together to come and take
[1:00:08] the
[1:00:09] city first here had to be a uniting of
[1:00:13] God's
[1:00:15] people
[1:00:16] so against the word of God before that
[1:00:21] the nation could unite
[1:00:23] itself
[1:00:25] against God's people the unity the
[1:00:30] unting I believe that we're living in a
[1:00:33] great uniting
[1:00:36] time I'm taking these red lights
[1:00:41] down amen and Flash signals and
[1:00:46] everything of the woman and how they do
[1:00:48] men and how they
[1:00:51] do and churches and how they do showing
[1:00:55] to this little group with all my heart
[1:00:59] that I believe we are lining in the line
[1:01:03] of God's
[1:01:06] word in this great prophetic
[1:01:09] hour just before the coming of the Lord
[1:01:13] Jesus uniting together and getting ready
[1:01:18] see before Titus United the
[1:01:22] Nations and his army
[1:01:26] Israel United themselves together and
[1:01:30] banded
[1:01:32] themselves they would not
[1:01:35] believe in Jesus to be the
[1:01:38] Messiah now you see you see this it's
[1:01:42] the same thing happening
[1:01:45] again the religious
[1:01:48] world in the Gentile
[1:01:52] World amen amen
[1:01:57] uned the
[1:01:59] military on the other
[1:02:02] hand under a
[1:02:09] power but before the military
[1:02:12] force can come to carry out the
[1:02:16] orders to slaughter all
[1:02:19] those who will not
[1:02:21] unite to this religious system
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:30] amen has
[1:02:35] take Hallelujah in other words what I'm
[1:02:38] trying to show
[1:02:40] you is that if this book of
[1:02:43] Acts is the
[1:02:46] alpha nowhere in the book of
[1:02:49] act do we see that Titus comes in to
[1:02:53] kill
[1:02:58] and if we're in another book of
[1:03:00] Acts we won't see that in this
[1:03:05] one we do see trials and
[1:03:09] tribulation we do see some
[1:03:13] persecution we do see some tightening
[1:03:16] up
[1:03:20] amen we see
[1:03:23] famine
[1:03:28] side you see many
[1:03:31] things but we don't
[1:03:33] see that they go through this
[1:03:39] part they
[1:03:49] were the Nations begin to unite
[1:03:52] themselves
[1:03:53] together
[1:03:55] and Titus brought this great Army of
[1:03:56] Romans and
[1:04:00] Greeks but it wasn't just Roman
[1:04:04] army because Jesus
[1:04:08] said that
[1:04:17] Nation didn't just say Rome was going to
[1:04:22] come amen
[1:04:26] but
[1:04:32] that but the thing
[1:04:35] is that that's in the
[1:04:38] sh this is in
[1:04:41] reality it was reality back
[1:04:44] then and they had another shadow that
[1:04:46] they looked
[1:04:53] at
[1:04:57] look there wasn't one of them
[1:05:09] Christians when Titus United these
[1:05:12] armies Greeks Romans
[1:05:16] whatever they be
[1:05:19] America you
[1:05:21] know uh the French the British
[1:05:28] Nat amen amen
[1:05:33] yes have they
[1:05:36] United just like Titus United the armies
[1:05:39] over
[1:05:40] there are the armies United
[1:05:44] today
[1:05:49] what
[1:05:51] so the word is perfect
[1:06:01] am
[1:06:02] Hallelujah but there wasn't one of them
[1:06:08] Christian in
[1:06:09] there for they saw the
[1:06:12] sign and
[1:06:17] move
[1:06:22] yes God does
[1:06:30] the Lord
