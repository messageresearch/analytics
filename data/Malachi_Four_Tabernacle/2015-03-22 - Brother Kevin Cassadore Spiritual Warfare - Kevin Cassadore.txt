TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but i like to go to church with people who like to have church some people just come to go to church others come to have church i'm glad you come to have church tonight as long as the lord's here that's all it takes and i appreciate this kind of an atmosphere because it's this kind of an atmosphere when the supernatural can be done signs and wonders can follow the believers god's when you're in the spirit just a little part of my testimony i grew up in church but that didn't mean i was saved but it wasn't until i was 13 years old that i personally gave my heart to the lord and it was in a little house meeting where there was a preacher from phoenix who had come to have church and there was not an open door for him to come so he went to a house and they had service there and i sat there as a young boy and i don't remember what he preached i just remember being in the living room and i was sitting on the couch by the back door and right next to me the owners of the house and then it would start saying amen so i sat next to this bird which was worshipped and i thought how the bible says preach the gospel to every creature sometimes i wish i had that bird in my church i felt the presence of the lord begin to deal with and i knew god was worth dealing with my heart and he said that's what you need that night i surrendered to the lord and i got saved by god's grace about a year after that i was in church one night at the home church and i had been serving the lord now for about a year a little bit a little longer and that night there was a i had an aunt who was sick in the hospital she had uh she was in an intensive care unit and i began to pray for my aunt and then as i was praying for her i felt the the voice of the lord so you need to pray for yourself immediately i began to repent i said lord for everything i've ever done my faults back speaking in tongues i never know what was happening i had never spoken before and i don't know how long i was there it might have been an hour maybe two hours and i staggered out to my grandma's house my grandma lives right behind the church so when i walked out the parking lot everybody was gone so i must have been there a while because you know how people hang out in the parking lot so i staggered into my grandma's house and my old apache grandma was sitting there at the table and she saw me staggering so she just raised her hands like this and she started praising the lord for filling one of her grandsons with the holy ghost well as soon as she started that here come the spirit of god all over again that was my first time experiencing the holy ghost and i knew god had changed my life from that point on my desires were no longer the same about a year later i was about 15 now a brother had called me to the front of the church and he had prayed over me and he asked me a question he said has anybody ever told you you had a calling in your life to preach the gospel and i said i never heard that before he said i see the lord has a calling for you and stay with this word of the hour about a year later now i'm 16 years old one of my mom's cousins she was he was a uh a pentecostal minister mr pentecostal and he had heard about testimony so he had asked me to come preach for him he said i want i want to give you one night to the young people and he said come and preach for me which was near phoenix arizona arizona and i preached this night and it was an outside meeting of course and the sides of the tent were up and so i got my bible and i had all my notes and i was so nervous i wrote down every word i was going to say every single word hello my name is god bless you i said lord thank you for confirming your words at that moment god taught me a very important lesson he taught me i have nothing to do with it my words have failed but he'll never fail as long as i and bring souls to christ amen praise the lord so that's when i preached my first sermon and uh it wasn't too much longer after that i was 17. that was just a month away from turning 18. when the pastor before me had resigned the church and went to do his own thing until god brings one up raises so that's kind of how my fire got lit and i certainly appreciate it the warm invitation i'm glad to be among the part of the bride of jesus christ and to bring our licks of fire together i certainly believe and i certainly thank the lord uh bringing us here safely to san diego it was about a seven hour drive but we're happy to be here so now as we look to the word of god we're reading about warfare and i want to preach to you tonight by the help of the lord about spiritual warfare how many knows we're in a we're in a battle how many knows that brother brown said we're not on a we're that the enemy no matter how hopeless through jesus christ praise god we got to be prepared just like the children of israel they were prepared joshua let's read it again that the priests took the ark stood in what moses and now the time has come that the spirit is coming to us can you take that word and manifest it because that word needs to be brought to pass this world be fulfilled what moses had said how dark is by he always vindicates his word he always speaks his wife where the word is if the word is here will come hallelujah there was john and here come jesus he said john right i just got to believe god will take care of the interpreter because the bible says no scripture of the word of any private interpretation god is his own interpreter and god will bring you to pass when that word is brought to pass in your life which is the interpretation of the scripture amen i mean so i'm not going to try to figure anything out i'm just going to believe it that's all i got to do is just believe it i like there's the simple it says it came to pass when the people were acclaimed passover that the ark of the lord passed over in the priests in the presence of the children of israel the ark and the priests in the presence of the people half the tribe of manasseh all passed over and the bible says they were armed but they knew over the plains of jericho to claim their promises so to go and take what god has promised to give them in verse 12 it said that they went according to moses had spoke to them it reminds the one who made the covenant 40 000 they were prepared they were ready they're prepared for battle prepared for war and when you go to chapter five i love this scripture here because it tells us that fear had came upon their enemy the supernatural began to be done among the people the god of israel and so people begin to talk and say hey have you heard there's a little church down there in a little storefront and they're just a little humble people there but man something's going on over there people in the streets are feeling it they're walking they're buying liquor i mean they call the presence of god they're getting saved on the streets they're sick of being healed or being delivered possessed are being set free that's exactly what happened praise god there's one thing that i love and that's to make the enemy nervous amen just think about it how many times has it made you nervous how many times has he stayed kept you up all night with pains but in to go in and to serve him an eviction notice diablo you squatted here long enough i have rights as a son in a diary jesus christ oh lord i wish you'd give me the victory now becky the the enemy had heard what was going on and they became they got afraid the spirit wasn't in them anymore and their heart melted they said hey haven't you heard you know either those people down there you know that group down there that one we didn't really know about it we laughed to make fun of these years there's something going on with those guys i believe is the gates and we then you'll leave out of here no matter what devil is ready i'm ready to face them all because greater is he that is in you you know brother ben says the message is victory day 1963 he says but you know all along there's been all kinds of battles fought there's also been god's believing just as on the natural side in the natural world so is it uh in the word with the scriptures we've had many great battles against our enemy and god has had great men out there standing and we fight it every day this great battle spiritual battle prophet says we fight it every day every christian fights a battle every day are you christian probably god you bowed to the world shall we give up to the thought that we've got and what if we see the focus how god takes it from genesis to revelation thus save the lord each time and we find there's without a positive confession there is no victory so no matter how bad you feel you can't go by feelings what is the word of your testimony that's why the bible says the power even jesus you gotta receive we get stuck looking at the trials or the circumstances all around us how bad it looks how people are against me no i don't feel very good if we focus on that who the prophet says he believed what the word said he was okay he'd look to the world found his place in the scriptures and said this day this word has completely and i the no baptism in the name of jesus jesus he said uh we gotta focus right back to the word and nobody can say it's not there so we are in a warfare and god's heroes but look how he includes a little church he said you little church remember back here you are a part of that unit you are a part of the kingdom of god even if you're just a small part it's enough you're still a part of it even if you're just a little toe you're still a part of the body god's body is the most powerful body of a shadow just a little shadow when god looks at us so your little church you are a part of that unit he says here that you are an outpost back here so brother sister we got to stay true to our post of duty right amen because when you come to church and you serve god you're not doing it for the pastor you're doing it for jesus christ when you are faithful you're an outpost back here or the baptist he is the chief captain of and you turn around and do something better orders you gotta stay with the word i know people take some of these promises and they try to uh uh manufacture something they try to bring it on themselves but that's not is here becky once again brother said the same message we've had many great battles spiritual battles many great v-days which is victory days against an evil spirit maybe it was in your body maybe it was in your children in your home in your neighborhood you came up against the spirit or in opposition of the enemy by god god has brought when she and the whole blood of men upon the earth all the sin in the he cleans amen i mean you believe that okay now watch here becky as a prophet of god says that we've had many battles great victories as well when we think about the battle that is raging and those two and then in another that's how god fortifies you is by the spirit of god to keep you on the straight and now they're constantly pulled out by these two forces and whatever side you yield rather than the demon possession that is influencing us word of god david says he teaches my hands to war teaches my fingers to fight because god he doesn't just throw us in the world say here figure out yourself he knows your limits so brother bram says he said if god leads you in the battle he's got his confidence in you let me tell you god has confidence in this right he has confidence in this little bride no matter what god leads you up against let's go just a little bit further now notice bro but today people have substituted something else where there's one church or you got to submit an application for membership don't get me wrong according to them they welcome visitors but you can only visit for so many times then you got to submit an application then it's got to go before the board be reviewed i choose to accept you you've got to sign a contract i'm not making the old birth cement which is what births you into the kingdom of god and they've turned to institutions of men but look what the prophet says he says he chose not to stay with the word so the devil gave her his word and that's how the first bride fell yes and you gotta you gotta be careful that you stay with god's word and you gotta believe his word to roll up behind the opponent that's the truth and they can jump shout out to cartwheels down the aisle and make it seem like it's true but when you test it with the word it amen amen so we got to understand i like how one preacher said the people's reaction to the preaching doesn't always mean conversion come on now amen amen even politicians know that i personally know politicians who are very charismatic and they can talk in such a way people want to listen adolf hitler adolf hitler a very charismatic speaker was such amen so now getting back to this brother says they have substituted something else and uh the best way god could ever protect his army fortify his army and they got away if he can get you separated from your source of strength and isolate you alone you're an easier target this is why people start getting called on the lord what's the first thing they do they stop well get him out alone isolate him from the past from the church so he can have easy access to the facility so we have to understand that we can't take the devil's substitutions we can't take the things of the world at the beginning he gave us the very best is the best and only to get holy ghost experience that he can get you out alone become an easy target so we got to stay fast in the word of god and be in the holy spirit and among the brothers of sisters of christ hallelujah now and we're living in the day and more he was and he brought the whole nominal world he got on his uh he let's see amelia after his ministry got on as he was writing to the ministry then come the ministry of the lord jesus he said and and god will reign in i want to be ready for the coming of the lord amen the lord is at hand the great climax is at hand amen victory day there is a people ready to fight they're not going is but there's still some in the lab there's still somebody somewhere i don't believe god's word who will not compromise that will stay true and fight to the end of the weapons of our warfare like the bible says some spiritual every they'll take god got one of the greatest anointings that any man has ever known we are the products messages is amen in oh god gives us what we need we're living in a great time we're living in a great time of deception a great time of evil but it's also a great time because they can feel the atmosphere they know something's happening they know we're living in the last seconds even the catholics that's why when the pope came to new york he addressed the cardinals he made a statement he only knew what god is that's god's blue presence it's of the world if you only knew what the power of pentecost really was oh brother sister wasn't that what elijah's message was about turn the heart of the children to the pentecostal prophet and restore the faith where are you identification final climax no matter what the by the grace of god of a by the grace of god there is oh thank amen amen why cry okay why cry why holler that's about it okay when all god says you ought to do something speak more powerful but even if you have just a little portion of god that's all the power you need hey man brother we we ought to be miles up the road than we are i'm kind of living below my privileges below even to the end of the world we have to do but for the true word of the living god holding on to shall see the you will see the glory of god if you need divine the only thing that people moses without hope when they were in the wilderness there was no water but they spoke to the rock gave forth a god and they all drank and they live lord that's all you got to do today brother you've got greatest lie the thirsty praise the lord as musicians play something softly under the lord tonight it's just let's just humble ourselves before the lord for a minute before we go tonight amen let's just talk to the lord amen i want to pray tonight and i want you to pray in your own way cry out to the lord our heavenly father lord we just want to thank you for your precious word we want to thank you for reminding us of all the time like glory of god has come upon you rise and shine lord i pray that you help us father i pray that you would search every heart tonight maybe little things that we've left undone the holy blood of jesus christ you know the enemy is going to come but help us to withstand help us to stand fast have our feet firmly planted on the unmovable rocks of our salvation no matter what i against all is faith that will establish them as a firm foundation fundamental or to be a lighthouse in this
