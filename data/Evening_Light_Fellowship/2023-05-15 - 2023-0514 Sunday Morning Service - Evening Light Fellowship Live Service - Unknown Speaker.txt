God bless you richly you wouldn't be here if you didn't have a mother so thank God for mothers amen uh my wife kissed me this morning on the cheek as I got out of the car and she said may the Lord bless your service today I said thank you sweetheart she started walking away she stopped one more thing stay focused [Laughter] bless your heart stay focused I'll try to Matthew 15 and verse 4. for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curses father or mother let him die the death wow his word is true amen Proverbs chapter 12. and verse 4. a virtuous woman is a crowned to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is rottenness in his bones a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband Proverbs 31 and starting at verse 10 and will read 10 and 12 then we'll drop down to verse 25. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies I want to ask you who is qualified to find a virtuous woman not just a woman a virtuous who can do it who's got the discernment who's got that guala a Godly qualification to find her who it'll take a prophet of God who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life verse 25 strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he prayseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellast them all the bride is the one who excels the virtue of all others favors deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God praise the Lord this morning good to have each and every one of you guests visitors each and every one I would like to title my sermon this morning The Virtuous bride will be the crowning Glory of Christ The Virtuous bride will be the crowning Glory of Christ and I want to take a subject this morning she will be the jewels in his crown virtuous women are found all throughout the scriptures and I want you to understand that they all had virtue before cleansing God doesn't look at the outside he looks at the inside God saw virtue before he saw conversion God wasn't looking at the outside shell of the woman at the at the will he was looking at the seed Gene that laid inside of her understand that she had hardwired into into her DNA a very virtue that can only be attributed to a sea Gene of God and Boaz had recognized the virtue of Ruth's character as she worked in his field she has shown more kindness and virtue in her latter years than she did in the beginning in Ruth chapter 3 verses 9 through 11 it's written and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth the handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art nearer Kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter and then in the beginning inasmuch as thou has followed not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city of my people doth know thou art a virtuous woman it says here that you showed more kindness I looked at this word kindness in Hebrew it actually means kindness towards God it means doing God good deeds you showed more kindness you showed more Good Deeds at the latter end than you did at the beginning that's why she has become a mature bride she's matured through seven Church ages and what she did in her immaturity in the early ages she will not do in the end he tells her not to fear don't be afraid for I will perform all that thou requires fear not little bride it is the Father's good pleasure to give unto you the kingdom and Boaz said these words he said not only do I recognize it but all of my people in the city he didn't say all of the people in the city he said all of my people it takes one to no one you understand that and so all of my people within the city recognize thou art a virtuous woman when boys took Ruth and redeemed her he saw in her virtue before cleansing Christ saw virtue in you before your conversion because the Bible says that God commandeth his love towards us that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us she laid herself down where Boaz laid a type of death and she laid down a type of laying down her life at the feet of Christ a type of the Bride who gives her life unto him where he dies she dies where he rises she Rises she marked the spot Naomi told her Mark the Spot where he lays down all of you should Mark that spot where Christ was crucified and therefore we must be crucified with him when he sees her he tells her stay here until the rising of the sun Ruth then rested in the promise of her Kinsmen Redeemer and we are resting in the work of our Kinsmen Redeemer also Ruth became heir to everything that Boaz owned and the bride becomes join Heirs of Christ a woman can only have inheritance through the Union with her husband it is that Union that makes her heir to his kingdom it is your union to Jesus Christ that makes you join heirs with Jesus and by your spiritual union to your husband you become one with him and the two become one flesh listen to this by that Union his virtue Becomes Her virtue his righteousness Becomes Her righteousness his Holiness Becomes Her holiness and his perfection Becomes Her perfection for she is his glory in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ you're standing completely you never sinned it the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the Accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing washed the old book of your divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence out of the very mind of God You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with appear unadulterated bright word that he has washed her by the water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was a virtuous woman is a jewel in a man's crown brother Branham says in my life story to see a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown she should be honored she's one of the best things that God could give a man a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she is a good wife but if she isn't isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown but an honorary one or no good one is water in his blood and that's right it's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest and children if you've got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you and keeping your clothes clean send your kids to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother when you break the backbone of motherhood you break the backbone of a Nation today this perverted work uh woke generation has desecrated the office of a mother let me say that when I speak of a woman or a character in her virtue I'm actually speaking of the church because a woman in scripture is always refers to as the church Ephesians 5 32 this is a great mystery I speak concerning Christ and the church the first example of a woman to become a mother in the Bible was he in Genesis 3 and 20 Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living now listen to this for a moment she is called the mother of all living but Adam is not called the father of all living brother Brennan picks us up in the Ephesian Church age he says scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is there for the United ones eyes to see it's there for a purpose Genesis 3 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living but no scripture says that Adam is the father of all living see the fact is that through Eve was the mother of all living but Adam was not the father of all living all of humanity that you see crawling all over this Earth today is a product of a fallen woman the role of a mother today has been so diminished and put down that for a woman to say that she's a stay-at-home mom she's looked upon as a second-class citizen Godly Parents who care about what is being taught to their children in our schools today are labeled domestic terrorists call it whatever you want but I and every Godly mother and father are interested in what is being taught to your children and we've let all of these perverted politicians and government officials and teachers and lbgq2 WXYZ because they keep adding to it let me tell you it's nothing but a perversion [Music] God help us and Godly mother is perhaps one of the most important jobs that is within all of Christianity a Godly mother if more mothers did their job correctly be a whole lot easier on us pastors easier for the teachers in the classroom come on teachers Say Amen yeah easier for the policemen on the streets but in order to really see and appreciate a true mother you have to see the law of contrast you don't really appreciate a good one until you've seen a bad one on one side you have the virtuous virgin bride of Jesus Christ on the other side you have Jezebel a religious woman called the Great and mother of harlots in the Book of Revelation the Bible is filled of examples of good Mothers as well as those of bad mothers just because you're able to conceive a child does not make you a mother or for a man to produce seed and Pregnant a woman does not give him the honor of being a father you have may have birthed the child but are you a mother you have me you may have gotten a girl pregnant but we'll be you be a father to that child the majority of the young people in America today and around the world come from a lopsided Parenthood a one parent isn't it amazing that some people today here in America do not want to be called mother they want to be called parent number two or a birthing person well that's about right they're just a birthing person they're not a mother they just birthed oh my watch this brother Branham said in the invasion of the United States by listen this was one of his Mother's Day sermons 1954 invasion of the United States your mother if you want to do something for her you do it uh 365 days a year go to her house offer prayer and live for God that's the real Spirit of motherhood and the real Spirit of Mother's Day Mother's Day is 365 days a year come on Church Say Amen it's not just today that we give her a rose it's not today that we praise her she should be praised every day if you have a Godly mother you should kiss her cheek you should thank her and you when you see you go out the door you realize that everything that was ever placed within you the foundation of your teaching started with Mama the first one to hold you the first one to tell you right and wrong was mama and the teaching on Moses again one of brother brennam's Mother's Day sermons he says now there's nothing any sweeter on Earth that we know of than a real genuine mother God bless her Gallant Soul a real real mother but we got so many substitutes today that's called mother that's not a mother they're just women who have children they're just my he said they're they're they're they're not mothers they call them today birthing parent they're not a month they didn't they don't even have the class to be called a mother an old-fashioned mother is one who cares for her family and don't lay out on these lounges and dances all night long smoke and drinking and come in she don't deserve that sacred name of mother she's just a woman that's all that's raising a child but not a mother because a mother has got a different meaning to it somebody say Amen I'm blessing you Godly mothers this morning Now understand that the devil fights Godly mothers and the Battlefront that all of you mothers will face will be with your children so you better take and put into their little virgin Minds when they are little and Young you start telling them of the love of God you start telling them about a god whom they should serve and not the God of this age and not the god of fashion and the God of all of uh that's in the world because we know there is a God of this world but Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if it were of this world I would send angels to fight the Battlefront rages within message mothers hearts even today the life of Abraham had to come through Sarah she was the channel for the Nations to come through her God gave the promise to Abraham but that promise was to be manifest in Sarah God sent the word to brother Branham but the word is to be manifested in the bride if you can destroy motherhood you have destroyed a nation you have broken the backbone of a Nation the brother Branham said in 1954 Imagine This the backbone of Any Nation is Womanhood when it comes to morals and you break down motherhood you broke down your nation a young man tried to find a wife that's even a virgin that's moral he'd have to go around some little old Holy Ghost Church almost to find one and that's exactly right where a man just keep her uh in and things like that got a little decency about her God give us Godly Parents that'll watch over our children and instill into their little minds and Mama I say it starts with you mother teach your children those things of God I want to share with you at this moment some of the words of Jesus that I believe are being fulfilled in this day Matthew 10 verses 34 through 38 think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword and I am calm to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of their own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he taketh not of his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me we're in an age when children are becoming disobedient to their parents young people today have little or no respect for their elders and they rebel against any kind of Correction and godly instruction proverbs 30 verse 11 says there is a generation that curses their father and does not bless their mother boy if we're in that generation it's now Leviticus 19 Verse 3 says you shall fear every man his mother and his father but I'll tell you what how many of you had a mother that listen she didn't mince her words she didn't play around with you there is something about a mother that'll correct her children and When Mama's voice changes that little child knows and just doesn't call his name but calls his whole name Ronald Allen Peterson I knew rate 10. I would stop in my tracks whatever I'm doing because mom my my mother never even liked us to have that look like you better wipe that smile off your face son I'm I'm fixing a cloud up and storm all over you yeah how many of you had a Godly mother that when she pointed her finger and told you sit down you sat down you didn't sit there and argue one man said you're my Offspring and if you don't obey you can spring off a man should fear his mother Exodus 21 verse 15 he that smiteth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death we're in a time when this prophecy is being fulfilled children becoming so disobedient to parents children that's the age of rebellion this is a time when the children have you noticed more and more children are killing their parents so they can have uh the money for Mom and Dad from Mom and Dad they didn't earn it a bunch of spoiled rotten little brats I tell you what you mothers and fathers better teach your children the right moral issues the value of a dollar give you think that you love your children you just give them everything that they want that's not what God does I think you ought to do the way that God does God doesn't give you everything that you want he gets you what you need not what you want oh God I want a Lamborghini God I want to parse you I want a Mercedes-Benz and but you better be happy if he gives you a Volkswagen come on now proud and heady and high-minded give it to me and I want it now they'll never appreciate anything unless they've worked for it amen we're in the age of this prophecy being fulfilled all of our mothers and fathers are and will be tested in this area and guess who's going to test you that cute little baby that you just birthed you give it time and if you don't start correcting I was with some young people the other day and quite honestly you know what I think I need to do Growing Kids God's way again because we got a whole new crop of kids coming up and those kids are getting away with anything they want oh God help us because you don't start correcting that kid now then wait until he's a teenager and you tell him no God help us Genesis 28 verses 6 through 9. and when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob you remember he was a blessing given to Jacob and he sent him away to pandem arum to take him away from fence and that as he blessed him to give him a charge saying Thou shalt not take away from the daughters of Canaan this is a direct word from the father and Jacob obeyed his father and mother and has gone to pandem arum and Esau look at this here's Esau his own brother seeing that the daughters of Canaan please not Isaac his father then when then went to Esau unto Ishmael and took unto him wise which had was made last the daughter of ishmael's Abraham's son the sister and they bought to be his wife and do you did you know that the Bible says that Hagar had chosen Ishmael a wife from the land of Egypt takes one to no one hear Hagar a bonds woman goes and finds a bride for Ishmael the Bible says it in Genesis 21 verse 21 and he went and he went in the wilderness of Parham and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt his mother picked his bride Abraham had his servant Ella eser to swear unto him to not take a wife to my son out of the land of Canaan Genesis 24 and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife under my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go into my country and to my kindred state of people that are within the message under no circumstance should a Believer go outside to look for a husband or a wife listen that's good for you and you listen to that you mothers and fathers you teach your children you get your daughter some interested in some nice looking boy out there and she comes up and say what do you think under no circumstance same way with the boy or the girl my daughter will remember she says Dad there was a young boy yeah he's he's kind of interested in me I said who is he she told me I said ain't no way no circumstance dads watch over your families bear carry a big stick yep yeah carry a club bazooka whatever you need man run them off I saw a t-shirt the other day said yeah I'm getting old and you young man don't forget you come around my daughter I don't mind doing something to you because I got many days left anyway that watch over their children huh go to Mike Kindred my people no matter how much you say you believe this message it's who you choose that is a reflection of what's inside you brother Branham not because we were talking about who can find a virtuous woman who has the ability who knows what to look for in a Godly Man or in a Godly woman so brother Brandon in a sermon and you all you young people you need to listen to choosing a bride the kind of a woman that man would choose reflects his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to it shows surely what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he marries I don't care what he says I don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world what sayeth if he would marry a a a a chorus girl or what if he'd marry a sex queen or just some pretty modern ricketta it reflects it shows what he has in his mind by whatever she is that's what the way she'll raise those children so it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that just shows what he's thinking of the future a true Christian will not look for such beauty queens and chorus girls and sex Queens he'll look for Christian character Now understand this a man is going to choose a woman to reflect what is in him why then did God choose a virtuous woman before the foundation of the world while ye she was yet in his mind he was forming her she was already part of his attributes but he couldn't have fellowship with her until she became manifested In the Flesh and the bride today she will be his glory she will be his virtue she will be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh she will be the glory of God is not the woman the glory of the man Adam was made in the image of God and at first Adam that God had made was the spirit man and he hovered Over the Garden and there was no man to till the soil he was the spirit man he was made like God and guess what God was alone in the beginning God was alone with his attributes he wanted to have fellowship with like kind but there was none so God began in the womb of his mind he began to have these attributes these thoughts and it wasn't until he spoke the spoken word is what creates whenever God said let there be light there was light when God said let the Earth come forth come forth and so God spoke listen to this the prophet of God said this little bride God spoke your name before you there was Stardust before you ever came to this earth God spoke your name what was he doing creating a bride he was creating a bride out of his own spoken word that's why she is word of his word lying upon life here a little there a little Adam dwells alone with no other humans of his own kind no one to share with to share Eden so God created him a helpmate she was the hidden expression of Adam's desire what was in Adam's heart became manifest In the Flesh of Eve and when she came to Adam he called her whoa man what a beauty you catch that he called her Whoa man I'm just going to add living a little bit but it's no doubt he said I ain't never seen anything that is so attractive as what she is she is born of my bone she is me in that woman form amen because with listen to this you talk about the importance of a woman the importance of a woman the species dies if there is no other portion to reproduce that which is in the man the species dies unless there be somebody to reproduce it Hallelujah do you understand God had to have a bride or the god species dies God could not reproduce himself he had to have the portion of him that he created that he might have Fellowship without the bride there would be no further lineage of God he is not complete without her and she is not complete without him the two shall become one flesh in this perverted movement listen to me now let me bring some Modern events down in this perverted movement today where they say there's neither male nor female they they cannot differentiate they cannot even say it the smartest most intellectual even people of Medicine we will not Define what is a woman what is a man I tell you they've lost their minds now watch what they're producing seedless children unable to reproduce they are mentally mutilating their mind first do you know on the door of every bathroom universally around the world shows the sticks figure of a woman and she's got a dress on I don't care what country you go to there it is universal sign woman Dress Man pants yeah it's too simple now watch this transgender thinking defiles and mutilates the minds first and creates them a genderless people if you have no gender identity you do not have the basic ingredient of Who You Are where you belong or what is your purpose remember now it's a mental mutilation starting in the mind first because how did Satan get to Eve first he seduced her with words in her mind he mutilated her thought her womb was defiled instead of taking God's word by believing only God's word he came and used to reasoning isn't this woke generation using the channel of reasoning Eve said because God said what happened Eve the serpent he beguiled me do you know what the word beguiled mean it means to seduce with words the serpent he beguiled me and I did eat you either the wrong thing you eat of the tree of knowledge that's why the biggest desecrated place in the world today is a university it's a tree of knowledge and you just go around a university today and you will see every kind of immoral not knowing who they are what gender they are it's because somebody started telling them when they were little brother Branham even went so far as to say you mothers don't you put those little Beetle haircuts on your boys keep their bangs out of their face and the hair off the back of their neck he said you'll make them little perverts boys do boys things girls do girl things don't give a doll to a boy give him a truck don't give a truck to a girl give her a doll then she's going to take care of that doll it's funny watch uh you ever seen a a a little girl tell her baby her little dolly dolly you better be listen to me huh I saw YouTube of a mother trying to feed her her little baby and and like this so she tries to feed the little uh dolly that is sitting next to her and of course the the little dolly doesn't do anything the mother takes his spoon quack it's that dolly Parton I said you're gonna eat takes his phone now comes over here you learn obedience by the things you suffer open up yeah mental seduction first he first took her mentally then he took her physically brother Ram said thy Tyrant Church age she is a dominating female now listen to me sisters brother Brenham says that a dominating female spirit is the seed of the Roman Catholic Church amen a dominating female you sisters be very careful because that's the age who is the god of America the woman you see now who all are being put into positions women and we've got a Mindless president who doesn't know where he's at if he didn't have a teller prompter in front of him he wouldn't even know what to say but God keep him alive because the second one behind him is a cackling idiot I'm sorry oh America is becoming a laughing star a dominating female she is a mystery Babylon the great she is Jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to God doesn't that a true female who can find a virtuous woman he said a true female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word but his no thought be his no leadership but his but what about the church she has cast out the word destroyed the Bibles were the essays of The Godly and she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over Kings and princes and Nations controls armies and insists that she is the True Body of Christ and that her Popes are the Vickers of Christ she is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn becomes the seducers of others she is the Bride of Satan and has produced his bastard child religion Adam was not deceived he knew what he was doing Christ knew exactly what his mission was when he came to Earth for this cause came I into the world that I might lay down my life for my sheep God could not kill Eve without killing Adam because God's seed laid inside a fallen Eve so these perverted teachers and woke mentors in control of our governments and our schools have taken and prescribed medications to children to change their sex hormone their bodies then become surgically mutilated to become seedless individuals a genderless generation is a seedless generation it is a sterile generation unable to reproduce itself now the prophet of God said watch during the time of the second world war pre-tribulation Spirits God upon three men Hitler mussolinian Eichmann and what did they do they wanted to genocide they wanted to sterilize they wanted to kill every Jew why because they were God's people with a promise you see Satan's after God's people and that's why he's trying to take the minds of our youth o God help our mothers to watch over the minds of their little children of what they see what they hear and what they feed their little Spirits upon Hitler Eichmann and Mussolini pre-tribulation spirits trying to genocide God's people it's happening it's called education it's called woke generation it's making them change their gender and when they do they mutilate their bodies you understand I'm talking adult language now they're mutilating them so that they could never have children with a seedless generation brother random said in choosing of a bride there might be one girl that's real pretty and the other one well her stature looks better than this one and you might have a sacrifice one over the other but if she's not a stature of a lady or a woman I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not pretty evening if a Christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like it's what she is which makes her then again it reflects his own Godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future and his family raised by a woman for the future plans that's why brother bran preaches choosing of a bride and then future home what he's doing is he's preparing a bride that he can have his own specie kind she's pregnated with his life do you understand that the bride of Christ will be the crowning glory of God himself she will be his glory she will be the jewels in this crown in the days of Sodom and Gamora so will it be in the coming of the son of man we have arised my my brother and sister brother REM says in the flashing red light of the sign of his coming I'm going over just some of my notes for the sake of time and you don't have it on the overhead here so you're going to have to go and find the archive sermon where they can show it to you and you can read these quotes 1963 the flashing red lights of the sign of his coming he said one of the most miserable things is to see a man or woman who has never accepted Christ I just live to be an old mossback church member meaner than Satan himself and see them out there with a crab it old something well I'll tell you I don't believe in that God never that's that's the horriblest crown that Satan can Crown a life with Satan can crown that life with a grouchy old woman about 60 or 70 years old with fat hanging down under her arms wrinkles all over her face and her hair bobbed up in four or five different colors and strutting herself down in a little pair of shorts if that ain't the crowning of Satan I never seen it some old crowded man fat hanging down under our wrinkles hair bobbed up four or five different colors sounds like somebody I saw at Costco the other day if that ain't the crowning of Satan you see the false bride is the crowning of Satan's Glory there is nothing more comforting as the comfort you get from your mother even God Likens his love to Jerusalem as that of the Comfort love of a mother Isaiah 63 13 says that's one whom his mother comforteth so will I comfort you listen do you remember when you got hurt as a kid you never went running for Dad dad didn't show you any sympathy no no when you wanted somebody to comfort you you wanted somebody to take care of you and somebody to kind of relate and yo you you got hurt you got a boo-boo oh come here let Mama kiss your little boo-boo my daddy never acted like that what's wrong with you son too far from your heart to kill you get back out there I never ran to Daddy I run to Mama and Mama run up on her lapo come here to go home I remember my twin brother and I were out playing he falls down gets hurt you ever seen a kid that falls down and gets hurt he runs off I'm going home and he runs home the whole way not even crying not even crying he gets to the front door what's wrong what's wrong my little baby I thought you hypocrite you ran all the way home you weren't even crying you waited wow but he is comforted by his mother s know how to comfort do you know that is a it is a proven factoring during war in the time of War when a man is mortally wounded and most of the men going to war are young men between 18 and 22. and when they get mortally wounded who do they ask for mama where are you the comfort that comes from a mama oh God give us mothers who can Comfort their children amen the entire the entire Book of Proverbs speaks about Godly mothers talks about their virtue if it were not for the wise counsel of Rebecca Jacob would have never gotten the birthright if Joshua bid the mother of Moses would have never told Moses he was a proper child the moment she had the vision first she taught Moses you are a Hebrew you are not the son of Pharaoh's daughter and he had instilled in his little mind and it didn't come up until he became a man and all of a sudden he saw two fighting he stood in the gap oh God if there had never been a Joshua the mother of Moses there had never been a Moses to deliver Israel if zobora would have not circumcised her son huh the God would have slain Moses if Rahab had not received the messengers into her home her whole family would not have been saved if it had not been for Esther to go before the king as the hazarus as a mediator the Jews would have been condemned to death if Mary had have not embraced the prophecy there would have been no birth of Jesus if there is no Bride for Jesus Christ there would be no finishing of the mystery of God there would be no final voice to the final age God bless our Godly mothers now as I began to study the message and everything that I do when I study the message I see through the prophets Ministry modern events made clear by prophecy because he now as a prophet Watchmen what of the night how goes it ye who stand upon the wall and he sees the Watchman sees way off in the future he can see what's coming before it comes the very first sermon that the prophet mentions Mother's Day 19 and 54. he preaches the invasion of the USA the last time he mentions Mother's Day in a sermon 1963 he preaches the world is falling apart a season of the future he sees something in his embryonic form before it comes to maturity 1954 this is the invasion of the USA brother Ram said what is it it's the devil the invasion's on I ain't saying nothing about this individual or that individual I'm saying it's unclean spirits that are possessing the people driving them into it the inphasium the United States the overthrow of the church the church is overthrowed by the devil it's invaded it's invaded our Nations it's invaded the United States imagine him preaching this 1954. but the invasion of the United States the devil has took her over don't be afraid to rush you Russia ain't got nothing to do we're doing it to ourselves our own rottenness right Among Us motherhood has been broken mothers don't stay at home no more with their children like they used to they got to have a job in closing no musicians if you come if you were raised by a Godly mother she instilled unto you much of your character and your attitudes in life sisters listen carefully chances are the way your mother served your father is the way you will serve your husband when a woman forgets or neglects her position as a mother and to help me she's out of the will of God she is not a doormat she is not a Slave she is not to be locked into the kitchen or chained to the bedroom her position is at home serving her husband and raising a family and teaching those little children the ways of God our newspapers today are filled with stories of men and women who have had children whom they never wanted they never cherish they never nurtured the child was often abused unloved and withdrawn into a world of personal isolation understanding what love is excuse me misunderstanding what true love is because this woman that birthed him never made him feel special never kissed his wounds Never singing to sleep never told him how special he was a job that is so important God places into the hands of a mother she sets the building blocks of character in a person's life if you want to find greatness don't look at the throne look at the Cradle and who rocks it they say whoever Rocks the Cradle rules the world my God how important is a real Godly mother to the church who can find a virtuous woman where is she her her price is far above rubies brother random says in the sermon ashamed surely there's something in this word from Genesis to revelation that some character in there that you dealt with would be on the same basis that would be my question he said father somebody in this Bible I know there's somebody just like me that has a special purpose God I want you to show me here's what he said I closed my eyes just let the Bible fall open my finger on the scripture Genesis 24 7. Ella easer Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac chills wrong all over me sure that's right with the rest of my message pulling out her Pride just a perfect message back to the word get that bride that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is to call out a bride that's what this message is all about is finding I've heard you as a woman you mothers if your Godly mothers and have Godly character you teach your children because you are the backbone of this church you are the backbone of this nation no wonder this nation is going down so quickly because the role of true motherhood is gone it's desecrated to even care what your children read and learn in school you are labeled a domestic terrorist a domestic terrorist there will be nobody that fights for their children like a mother huh yeah just walk in the woods sometimes find a couple little cuddly looking little bear cubs come out there and they're kind of playing and Oh Come here little cubby come here let me play with you let me take you home I'd like to take you home and all of a sudden [Music] somebody sent me a clip of a little bear cub that is being chased by a mountain lion this is this got one of the highest Awards of of cinematography in the world and this lion is chasing a little bear cub and the little bear Cubbies he's just running away and he's running as fast he can he goes across a river and he goes up climbs a tree and he climbs out onto the limb or excuse me out onto a tree trying to get away from this lion and he's on the the end of this tree and the lion like this and it's it's swiping you can see the blood it's hitting this little bear cup and a little bear cub all of a sudden it just falls into the river part of the the log or the limb of the tree it falls down into the river and the lion follows it down knowing that that bear cubs got to come to get out of the water and when it does the little bear cup now is backed up to where hey I've got to fight and so he's he's trying to make himself as big and as ferocious as he can and he's trying to give out that Roar the lion is swiping him and the line is ready to give and all of a sudden the lion the mountain lion gives up and runs away and a little bear cub yeah then it shows the mama bear behind him going ah but that little guy thought it was me man
