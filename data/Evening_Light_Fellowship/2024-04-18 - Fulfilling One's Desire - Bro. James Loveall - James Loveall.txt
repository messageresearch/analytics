him but don't know him personally that's right Hallelujah and when you have an intellectual understanding of who God is it doesn't do anything for you it can't do anything for [Music] you you know I came into a a shop this week and a man sat at his desk and I can see it written all over his face he had just read a text and he was troubled and I said everything all right he says I don't know yet but he kind of brushed it off and we talked a little bit and I Left Something Something Told me go back and pray for that man I went back in there and I began to talk to him and I said sir I'm I'm a Christian and I I want to pray with you would you mind if I pray with you and he kind of stood up and he threw his shoulders back and he says I'm all right I don't need that he says and I also have you to know I have 11 10 11 years of schooling and I felt sorry for that man yes amen I did I felt sorry for him because I said if that's your desire I'll leave it at that you have a blessed day I went out the door but I felt sorry and had a burden for that man because you could have a intellectual knowledge of who God is and it won't do anything anything for you but I know a God that is so personal and he's so real that you can call him onto the scene yeah and he said If my people will call on my name sir will I not hear them yes sir amen do you believe that amen let's go before him in prayer father we humble ourselves this evening once again in your presence Lord [Music] father I'm asking that you would come by our way and that you would Minister to hearts that you would speak to lives yes Lord my greatest desire is to know you more and to love you more because in knowing you I can serve you yes Lord so father we're just asking that you would come by our way and you would break the bread of life to us that you would open our eyes of understanding father would you fulfill your word for you said in your word where two or three are gathered in my name that's a promise and we are standing upon the basis of your word yes Lord come and have your way tonight father I'm asking that you would walk the aisles that you would speak to every heart come by our way we commit It For Your Glory in Jesus name amen amen and amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to James too and we want to thank brother Ron for the opportunity and we want to certainly remember him for traveling mercies and as well for uh brother Steven and sister Ashlin are going up to Idaho this weekend to minister for uh the youth banquet up there and um for brother Paul halit so we want to remember them in prayer as well we want to welcome brother Boy Scout and his family and um we want to welcome a special guest to me and I I don't want to you know but one of my high school teachers is here tonight and uh I certainly want to make him welcome and he's been a mentor and somebody that I have a lot of respect for you know those teachers that inspire you and yes they instill things in you in the high school years of your life and he was my high school basketball coach and uh you know we may have but it heads a little bit but it's a respect that I have for him and an appreciation for him and you know even something that is instilled in me is he he would tell me or he' tell the team whenever we were practicing he would say give me 100% plus 10% yep he says but only you know if you're given that extra 10% a lot of people know when you're given 100% you can see it and you're straining but you know deep down if you got a little bit more to give and that now it just doesn't apply but I still apply it today listen I give 110% amen and we should do the very same thing as Christians and message Believers and serving God living for God we should give 110% every day of Our Lives yes amen yes sir so we make you welcome Mr deal James 2 in verse 14 it says what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him and if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone right yeah a man may say thou H has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show you thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well thou believest that there was a prophet sent for this day thou doest well thou believest and knowest that thou Hast to come to church that doest well but guess what the devil believes the same thing he knows the same thing but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead let's skip down to 26 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so we understand here that you can't have one without the other that they go hand in hand and you as a Christian they must go hand in hand it shows the very desires the very the conduct of a Christian is expressed here that your faith is expressed by your works or your Works expressed by your faith there and let's go to John 6 St John 6:38 and I was listening today and the prophet said you know faith is what godone sees but works is what your neighbor sees it's pretty simple yeah St John 6 38 verse 40 or 38 to 40 for I came from Heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me we see will here is an expression expressing a desire or consent or a willingness so Jesus is saying I have not come down to chase after or to go after my own desires and my own will but I've come down to fulfill those of who has sent me and this is the Father's will which he hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing yes but should raise it up in the last days and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may he may have everlasting life and I will raise him up in the last days what a promise that is amen what a promise that is and even in verse 38 for I have come down from heaven not to fulfill my own will right you know you and I are fulfilling that same scripture yes right yes that we have come down from heaven we have come from God and we're going back to God but are you fulfilling the desires of your father you can be seated this evening and so we want to look and kind of launch off of a a similar uh lines of the the expression from the heart as we spoke last time and as a man thinketh in his heart now we know that many s uh you know the science has tried to disprove science has tried to disprove thank you science has tried to disprove this of a man thinking in the heart and as we looked at it the last time that a man you know a science would say that a man thinks with his his mind and how can a man think with his heart but Jesus said in the word that as a man is he thinketh in his heart so is he and we looked at this and we understand as we spoke last time that God placed down in the heart of every man a soul a little portion that he placed there to give a man a soul and that's what makes Humanity so different than all the rest of his uh creation whether it be animal life or uh uh plant life and everything else and all the orbits that he created he created a human and he put a soul that they could have their own desires yes they can have their own choices yes make decisions of their own right and whatever a man the very heartbeat of a human lays within that Soul whatever he thinketh in his heart he becomes and whatever those thoughts are they lay dormant there and they are unexpressed but once you begin to speak those thoughts when those things be be you put them to a word they are now becoming expressed the very desires the very heartbeats of that heart of that human being and in that soul of the human race it don't matter the color the where we come from every one of us has that part of us in that in our hearts right and God operates there because he gives us certain desires certain wants and so tonight if I can talk on fulfilling one's desire and for a subject would be I will show thee my faith by my works now Jesus said if you if you don't believe me believe the works that I do amen for my Works testify of who I am yes amen listen many people might not understand the message they might not have a an understanding of what is happening in the prophet that was sent for this day and all these different things but yet you see that if they don't believe that believe the works that follow it yes amen sure Ephesians 2 and verse 1 and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin wherein times past you walked according of the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others fulfilling our desires fulfilling our wants our desires of the mind and of the flesh but God who is rich in mercy God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us you Lord even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace by grace are you saved amen I'm so thankful for the grace and the mercy of almighty God Wonder now remember that you're in a battle and you're constantly going through this Warfare and if we're not careful you got me always H there it is always happens to me but if we're not careful Mark 4 19 says and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of the other things entering in choke out the word and it becometh unfruitful and so you see the cares of this world and this deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in and I love how he leaves it open-ended that the lust of other things the lust of other things why because we're all different we're all made up a different we all have different desires and lust of this and lust of that maybe lust of sports or the desire of sports or the desires of wanting do this or careers or whatever it may be the lust of other things he leaves it open-ended so us as humans we can't put say you know many times that's what we try to do is we try to push the boundaries we try to push the boundaries as if we put something on it then you can say well he didn't mention that or he didn't say this but the lust of other things includes us all and I say Lord help us don't let those other things encumber us because we want to be fruitful Christians we want to produce fruit some 30-fold some 60-fold some 100-fold but as long as you're producing fruit is what matters that's right because you see the cares of this life it says it doesn't choke it and kill it so the tree is still alive but it takes away the fruit but let me ask you what good is a fruit tree to a farm armor if it doesn't produce any fruit think about it yeah amen what good is it what good are you as a Christian if you're not willing to produce fruit for Christ right help us to be Christians that always bear fruit that people can come and glean on I don't want to be a Christian that is going overcoming and then undergoing and overcoming and undergoing and as the Bible says that the the husband men would have to come and dung around the tree one more time and then he goes through a cycle in life and then he comes through something else and then you got to dig around it again and then you got to dig it around it again let us be fruitful Christians yes our works testify of our desires I want to take the contrast or let's say the negative side of you know some of our desires as humans or as Humanity because the Bible says the cares of this world is we've read the worldly desires choke out the word which is most important in our lives it's fulfilling our own desires fulfilling our own wants and there was one in the very beginning that began to express his very own desires and his own wants yeah in Isaiah 14 and 12 he says how Thou Art fallen from Heaven listen how Thou Art fallen from Heaven there's a difference between coming from heaven and falling from Heaven yeah did you catch it there's a difference from falling and coming from Heaven Jesus said I have come from Heaven to fulfill my father's will and that's exactly what we have come this evening to do is to fulfill our father's will that's good brother how th are fallen from Heaven one is being sent to fulfill and one is coming down because of loss of position yes loss of power yes sure oh Lucifer son of the morning how art there cut down from to the ground which thou weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into the heavens I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and I will Ascend above the highest of the clouds I will be like the most high you see where his desires laid it's an i i i i mentality in a me me me mentality if you look at society today it's all about themselves people make everything about themselves it's a selfish desire I will do this and I will put my career above my family and I I will put my this over that and you put preeminence over the things of the world and things that don't matter so much but you see why when things Begin to Fall Apart families begin a man that works too hard and he spends all his hours in the office and I'm going to do this for myself and I'm going to I want to move up the corporate chain and I want to do this and let he leaves his family behind he leaves his kids he neglects his kids then we wonder what happens what is happening to this generation marriage has become so selfish right that give me my own desires that's what it's for and we're not there to fulfill the desires of our spouse to give them what they have need of and something came anybody know what a prenup is blows my mind why get married in the first place right it's like why and now people don't even take that step to get married why because then we got to go through the process of divorce why is divorce so rampant amongst our society there's no commitment there's no nothing true and they want to sign a prenup just so they don't have to then we let's just just in case it don't work out the sad part is is sometimes Christians want to do the same thing just in case it don't work out I say Lord help check our motives check our desires because you see the neglection toward kids and people want to blame the kids but the parents are the ones that are working too much and leaving them behind sending them to daycare having somebody else raise them and you say well brother James I don't send my kids to daycare I send them to daycare grandparents it's a good substitute it's a good substitute but that's not the home is supposed to be right because if the mom wants to work too much and wants to be in the career and I understand we got to do what we have to and we're living in a society where we make decisions and we make choices and I understand times get hard and sometimes they say well you have to have dual income and you got to do this but yet check your motives and your desires check the reasons behind it because if you're not fulfilling your desires as a mom being the Fifth Gospel to the kids something's wrong though the grandparents is good though it might be somebody in the church you see from a very young age you don't have to teach a kid to be selfish it's my toy this is mine you got to teach them to share when they get a younger sibling then they want more attention right but you see the desires of a kid you know we just went on this short little camping trip and we took a group photo and noan wants to see himself in the photo I see me I see me so you got to zoom in you think it's funny but you guys do the same thing every photo you guys take in a group setting who's the first person you zoom in on make sure you look good your hair's done right oh we got to retake it my eyes are closed you only care about yourself in the photo we're just being truthful it's just our flesh it's the desires of this flesh it's Humanity that's true you know from the youngest to the oldest we all have different desires you can ask the young kids what do you want to do what do you want to be oh what do you what do you want to do today if you ask no only wants to play ball every day after work if you ask somebody else it might be something else and there's nothing wrong with those desires it just depends on the stage of life that we're in in the variety of groups of the group that we have here they can differ from east to west Amen brother brandham says in a thinking man's filter he says when you come into this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lives within your own Spirit the desires of sin and the love of sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance that's right but down inside you somewhere here you come and there was something in there that began to draw and you know it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read him in his word but when you use God's filter when you use God's filter which is a thinking man's filter because all other filters will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter a thinking man's filter there is nothing left but the Holy Ghost amen now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when that soul of yours will line up to with the word of God in every respect it shows you've drawn your life through the thinking man's filter God's filter what is the filter it's the word of God it's the word of God and if you take your desires through the word of God listen as we sung the song God is unchangeable Unstoppable but his word doesn't change he don't compromise for nobody amen true true brother that's [Music] right his filter never changes his word never changes no matter where we're at if we're a son or a daughter of God we might go through hard times even Jesus in the garden he came to a spot that he desired something else he came to a place that he said if it let this cup pass from me but if it be your will see he was bringing his life back into the filter of almighty God he was thinking bringing that filter back in line you see the prophet of this day he did the same exact thing he came to a place that he was fed up with the people yeah he was fed up he was tired he said I would go up into I wish to go up into the mountain I desired to go up into the mountain to be a hunter and be a Trapper and when the word of the Lord came unto me maybe I'll tell take that word and I'll go and speak unto the people and then I'll go back right but what happened yeah he had to bring his life back in line with that filter back in line with the word of God and God told him you lose your family over it your wife will leave you your kids they won't have nothing to do with you why because it doesn't line up with God's filter absolutely now I want to read this story here if we can turn to acts 8 because this is a man that had a desire and God knows exactly where you're at and what you're going through acts 8:26 and the angel of the Lord spake unto philli saying arise and go toward the south in the Scofield bible says toward the South means at noon time and unto the way that thou goest down from Jerusalem un Gaza which is Desert now I love that the Bible says here that he lets it lets us know that it's a desert place because God works in desert places yes he works in areas that we don't think is possible he he works in a place that who wants to go out into the middle of the desert at noon time and God will meet them there I'm going to send my servant there a least unexpected place because a desert represents a place where things aren't going right maybe you're dried up on God a place where you might have a question a desire in verse 27 and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia unic of great Authority Under Candace Queen of the Ethiopians who had charge over all her treasures and had come to Jerusalem for to worship and was res returning and sitting in his Chariot reading isaas the prophet so as we look into this story we see that he was coming from Jerusalem he had already worshiped brother the brandom would say that he was hanging around the llds and the DDS and all the denominations of the world and he went into to to to study and to worship and do his rituals of the day and he would go into the city but then he was coming back and he was reading a message book for his day yeah he was reading a message book for his day and he began to read the prophet yeah that's good amen yes sir you know if we bring it down to our day yeah it would be you driving down 101 in your Frontier driving our car you know I think we get distracted too many times you ever have an alone time with God in a car oh yeah where he comes down and he meets you I had some special times why because you're I'm always driving but yet we get caught up and you know and they're they're not necessarily even bad things but you can get so easily distracted by listening to the radio and listening to this music or listening to a podcast everybody wants to share their opinion right so you listen to a podcast and you can listen to Dave Ramsey and listen to everybody else's problems but what good does it profit honestly what good does it profit when it's just as easy to put on the profit of the day amen and maybe you never know God may send somebody your way they begin to show you things and reveal things to you then the spirit saith unto Phillip go near and join thyself to his Chariot and Phil Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understand thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept a man guide me that's it and he desired and Phillip and he desired Phillip that he would come up and sit with him now God gave me when I came across this story it might seem so small but let me tell you something your desire is what God gives God an opportunity to come on the scene right yes your desire gives God an opportunity to come down and meet you where you're at yes sir if you have a desire for more of him there's more of him to have that's right that's good a simple desire gives God an opportunity to operate and to come on the scene because we see here that the place of the scripture which he read he was led as a sheep to the slaughter like a lamb dumb before his Shear so opened not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the unic answered Phillip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this himself or some other man and Philip opened his mouth and began with that same scripture and preached unto him Jesus Hallelujah Jesus he didn't preach the Creeds he didn't show them all the seals he didn't break open everything he preached unto him Jesus yes all you have to do is share what Jesus has done for you share what God's done for you in your life yes that's what will make a difference sure does many times we stumble too many because we got try to get them to a certain point we try to tell them everything we know and your name's written in the book and this book and that book and they're like what book am I in right because we see it but it takes Revelation and understanding to catch those things but just preach unto him Jesus amen and as they went there where they came a certain water and the unic said see here is water what doth hinder for me to be baptized you see as he began to expound unto him and he began to preach unto him Jesus he said there is a certain water now water in the desert makes you wonder if it was just a btle or what kind of water was it cuz there was just no name in the middle of a desert God provided for this unic exactly what he had need of and let me tell you in your desert Place God can provide the very thing that you have need of yes sir amen it can be an impossible situation but yet God could provide the very desires of your heart you see God provided the very thing that this man desired and God had an appointment with this man God had an appointment amen he said I'm going to send my servant Phillip to meet thee at this time and let me say something God always meets and makes his appointments yes amen no matter where you're at in life and how busy life is let me tell you something if you have an appointment with God God will meet you there that's right am you know I begin to think that God in his infancy he began to have these desires that he wanted to fulfill and God is so great that he began to come down and he you can never never put God into a box you can't put God into one object you can't say this is what God is because God is so great that whenever he came down and he created the heavens and the Earth so you see him in the heavens and you see him on Earth and you see him amongst the people there's no one attribute that defines who God is right there's not one attribute that you can say that's what God is because God is so different and yet God comes down and he might be watering the rock to some he might be Mana from Heaven to another he might walk on water to show the Miracles he might speak to the storm and the storm obeys him right but yet you see how God he's his desire is to express himself in so many different ways and he's here to fulfill the very desires of our hearts and if your desire is to have more of God there's more of God for you to receive for the Bible says with all thy getting get understanding get Revelation and there was a desire I came across this story of Elisha we all know it in 2 Kings 2 Elijah and Elisha and Elijah told Elisha to T here and they came to Bethel and he said I want you just to T here I'm going to go further right and he came to a place and he said no I want you to T here I'm going to go on but Elisha said I must go with you I must go on with you and they came to the place of Jericho and he said I want you to stay here I must go on but he says no I'm going to go with you why because there was the desire of Elisha there was something in Elisha that desired to have a double portion of what Elijah had yes sir amen that's right yep and as I begin to look into this story if Elisha would have listened to his prophet and carried and stopped when he told him he would have missed the double portion for him he would have missed the very the the portion that God had for him that double portion that he was going to pour out his spirit and give him a double portion he would have missed it if he would have listened to the prophet in stad amen and sometimes in our lives we must go on we must press on sometimes we don't understand why do I desire to do this or why do I hunger to do this or some you know ones have a burden to go onto the mission field or something in there is a burning but yet you must heed to that desire you must heed to that very warning that God has given you heed to that desire amen so we see that there was more that Elisha had to receive but he would have missed it if he didn't stay with the prophet God's provided place of worship he says we find that his successor was Elisha which is a type there of Christ in the church Elisha Elijah had done four Miracles and Elisha had done eight he had a double portion like was poured down upon the church so do you see the pattern yes that everything that God was he poured down into Christ and everything Christ was he poured down into the church amen amen prise the Lord and we know that this elishah anointing would H Elijah anointing would happen five times yes we know this Elijah Elisha John the Baptist then the prophet to the Gentiles than the Jews so we know that we've had an Elijah anointing in this hour amen we've had an anointing but yet there's also an Elisha anointing of a double portion being poured out because everything that God was he poured himself in yes let's read in Second Kings 2 Kings 2:8 and he says and Elijah took his man and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided thither hither and thither and so that they went to they went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they had gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let Ador a portion of thy Spirit be upon me yeah that's it and he said thou H has asked a hard thing that ass a hard thing you know it's okay for you to ask hard things because we have a God that a answers hard questions amen had answers for all these desires that we have that we have but he says you have asked a hard thing but nevertheless nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be unto thee but if not it shall not be so and we know the story that it goes on that a chariot would come down in a whirlwind and Elisha I'm sure he struggled that in this Whirlwind his wind is being blown around he's trying to watch because he knows that his double portion lays within watching Elisha Ascend into heaven and so I'm sure as he struggled and he he was blocking the dust and he's trying to make sure that he catches it and Elijah goes up and his mantle comes down and it falls upon the Earth and Elisha goes and he Rin His Garment what was he doing he was taking off the old garment and he was taking on a robe the prophet of God said he would begin he he would go over to the mantle and he would pick up his mantle and he'd pick it up and he put it on and he said it fit just right 42 short and it fit just right what was he doing he was putting on the Garment he was putting on the double portion that was given unto him it was a sign unto him because he said if I Ascend you will see a you'll have a double portion yeah right but now we see that as that was taken on and he put on that garment what was it now he came to the River Jordan and as people looked across the river Jordan they would see this man and I'm sure it was far enough that they couldn't tell is that Elisha is that Elijah why is there only one of them right yeah but they're dressed like Elijah he's dressed he's got the robe of Elijah it must be Elijah but then whenever he smoked that he bound it up he bound up the mantle and he smoked the the River Jordan and it parted and he came through and the sons of the Prophet said does not the spirit of Elijah lay upon Elisha right right that same spirit that laid upon Elijah is now upon Elisha and it's no different today are you catching it it's no different today the same spirit that was Upon Our Prophet is now within the the Bride of her himself yes everything that God was he's pouring himself [Applause] down that's good there's no need to see what the prophet did what he did was great and it's wonderful and we can look and that's proof and that's works of what he's done yet how much more and how much greater are we Desiring more of God Are we hungering more of God do we want a double portion for our day amen Amen brother brandham says in the rising of the sun he says now then that fellow picked up that robe a type of the church again see he picked up that robe now he had done it twice the Miracles which is a type of Christ in the church Elijah had done four and he done eight see he was the he had he was double the power cuz he had ask for it sometimes all you got to do is ask Church all you got to do is ask amen why don't we have the things the very desires of our hearts cuz we're not asking we're too afraid Satan comes by and says well he can't do that or he can't fulfill that or your situation is too far gone let me tell you nothing is impossible for God no matter the situation no matter where we're at nothing is impossible for God and we understand that it's not some man's anointing that we're Desiring after it's not about a man right it's not to be like a man but it's the spirit of the man the god that dwells within that man the spirit be upon you I ask for a double portion of that the bride is dressing herself in the word and receiving the power making herself ready amen making herself ready what is it God just like in Luke 17:30 what is it God revealing himself to his people God coming down making himself known the bride is dressing herself putting on the robe the Garment the Elijah of today is not is Jesus Christ himself sure it's God's Great desire to make himself known and if you keep reading in this chapter that Elijah had such an anointing and such a quickening power in his life that he would live to be 80 90 years old or whatever it may be and he died and they put him into a tomb yeah the Bible says that there was some and there was thieves coming and so they threw a dead man's body in there to hide him and the man resurrected yep there was still such an anointing even when he was dead and gone that his bones carried a power that could Raise A Man from the dead what a power what anointing am that is that's Amen to bring a man back to life and that same quickening power is still alive today amen amen Ephesians 2 and one and you hath he Quicken who were dead in sin yes amen but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin hath quickened us together with Christ and hath raised us up together and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that is in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves but it is a gift of God not of Works lest a man should boast that's right not of works not of things that you could do you can't earn your way into into the kingdom of God am you can't you can't believe and be so self-righteous and come to church well I come to church and I serve God and I live this way and I do my due diligence and I and and I have a Bible study every morning and I and I do all these things th do as well but yet your Works identify the very faith that you have amen for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works yes which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them it's not of works alone lest any man should boast it's nothing within ourselves but it's only by the grace of almighty God Amen Saints it's only by the grace of God where go I even as the unic asked Philip how would I know unless the man show me right and expound and reveal unto me these things listen we're a privileged people we're a privileged people to know what you know to serve a God that you do to have a relationship with him am yes sir yes sir what a privileged people we are am we can never exhaust God's goodness toward us we can never exhaust or ask him too much and I think many times we live beneath our privileges amen because we're not asking enough we're not Desiring enough we're not hungering enough our Prophet said if the prophet of this day had to say he he had to be more sincere how much more should we be more sincere in our daily Walk With Jesus Christ that's true brother absolutely you see because sometimes our makeup whatever we're raised up in that's what we desire for we desire those things if you're constantly let me say this not all you know I grew up playing sports and it was something we were around and something we enjoyed and we just always did it but see that might not be a desire for some other kid that's unathletic and all these things right but yet it was something that we enjoyed and we had fun doing and it was a a desire that we had but yet it wasn't something that defined who we were right you understand the balance because if we take the preeminence away from those things or from church and in our Christian walk and things we got to be careful as parents that we don't instill a love for something that it goes way over way over and then there becomes an imbalance because once it gets out of balance bance to Bring It Back in Balance is a hard thing if I tried to take a bat away from my son right now it'd be a hard thing so that's the way we discipline him because he's hard-headed like me and he could take a spanking so we take away his Bat and he don't like that he learns real fast but you see we can never exhaust the blessings toward us or the the goodness of God toward us brother Brandon would use an example that he would say you know it would be un how did he put it something to do with a little fishing that if the fish said I better not drink too much and he's swimming in the ocean it don't even make sense you see sometimes in our mind we get so caught up and if this little fish said oh I I better not drink I better not eat too much but yet he lives in the ocean how vast and how great that ocean is it's no different for you and I in closing who desires are we fulfilling tonight have we been so caught up in the desires of the world so caught up with the cares of life that our spiritual life begins to sink down a little bit you know in studying this God just was dealing with me you know sermon like this it just puts us back in focus it puts us in remembrance of those things to make sure listen you know we can hear the services and and we've heard them over our special meetings and your name is written in the book and and I believe that and I love that and there's something to it and it does something for me but what these services do is it checks to make sure that that my life is lining up with that name that's written to making sure that we're on track [Music] amen because many of us and I don't want to say us in general but I'm just saying as a whole what can happen is is we get so worked up in our faith and our if you believe faith and I believe God and predestination and Hallelujah which is all true but you better show me your Works your life better line up with the word amen your life better go through the filter of the word amen that's good I will show thee my faith by my Works musicians come you know and I'll never forget as good as services and special meetings there was something that brother Eugene said he says if you want if you want a a different result make a greater sacrifice yeah make a greater sacrifice sacrifices are hard that means you have to give up something amen you have to put time into something yes amen because it would be too easy sometimes I was talking with brother Matt and he said you know I wanted to read my Bible every day and I read it and it didn't fulfill anything like your life didn't change like it didn't do anything it didn't fulfill that desire I thought I would become Invincible I thought it might change doing something but it didn't do anything but yet it's a priority it's something we must do yeah if we want a different result make a greater [Music] sacrifice that puts the ball in our [Music] court it puts the ball in our court because many times we try to work our way into heaven we try to do this or that or maybe if you show up to church on this time and you do all these different things and show up to every youth meeting and be at church every service which is all good but it's works that we're Desiring works that we can put something to but a greater sacrifice is what we need let's
