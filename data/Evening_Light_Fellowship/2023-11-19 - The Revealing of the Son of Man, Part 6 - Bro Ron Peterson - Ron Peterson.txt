every one of you to to all of you and all of our visitors and brother Robert has done such a good job I want to go right into it but I want to sing a song have faith in God just just have faith brother Bram said if you get the people to believe amen so believing is Faith that's right belief is sin see if you don't believe in God if you don't have faith how can you approach him how can you come before him faith is the foundation it is the stone upon which the Church of the Living God is founded upon let's sing this song and worship him oh have [Music] God [Music] oh PR in [Music] God faith in God for the answer have [Applause] one more time now have faith in God lift your hand and sing have faith in God [Music] oh in God faith in God for the [Music] [Applause] answer in God Amen God bless you all this morning let's go directly to the word thank you musicians each and everyone it's good to be in the house house of the Lord amen amen this is the first time that we I have been behind the pulpit with this new sound system they took down all of the speakers that were here originally uh and they have now put these towers up and so all of those speakers are gone and all of that which you are hearing is coming right out of those speakers systems um it is amazing the technology of what they can do today in fact these things are so Hightech that Jude Murray told me if you took a chair a certain spot that somebody was sitting in and you digitize that they get no sound they would sit there with no sound can you imagine they can they can take the sound and digitize it and they can eliminate somebody sitting in a seat and they the person next to him would hear the Amplified voice and that one would stay there in silence that's amazing but that's just goes to show you there can be people sitting in church and some are hearing that's right and the others are sitting right there in silence but to him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church amen now to just um give a couple words here before we get into this you understand that when you read your Bible that sometimes chapters that you just turn the page and you get years of the journey whether it be Abraham whether it be Moses whether it be the life of Ezekiel or Daniel you see sometimes we we we tend to to think that those things were happening immediately and one after another but really it was a journey it was a progressive unfolding and so you look at the prophet's Ministry and what you do is sometimes you you stand back and you look at the progressive unfolding from 47 unto 65 on the taped uh archives that we have and yet the unfolding started long before that amen started at his birth God watching over him Supernatural signs he hears a voice Don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body you know the continual unfolding a woman says uh do you know there's a light following you do you know I know the day of your birth oh quit it just all of this stuff and he was seeing visions he was having all kinds of things his own Pastor told him it's of the devil so he goes out and he's praying oh God I don't want this if it's wrong I don't want it and there an angel appears and said you've had a peculiar birth and your ministry is going to be so different and as Moses was given two signs you'll be giving two signs and brother Brenham now he begins his journey in a Ministry he's inherited all kinds of false teaching the Pentecostal Church which was the most recent move of God had already now denominated and they had split up into all kinds of different groups in fact brother Brenham said it took the Catholic Church 2,000 years to get where they're at today he said the Pentecostals give it another 50 years and they'll even be worse amen and so we see this continual unfolding the ministry was getting greater and yet sometimes when you see when he enters into the third pole the congregation got smaller amen but the word got far greater amen amen Luke 17: 28-30 I love to hear those pages turning amen amen thank you Lord even as brother Mike Patterson taught me as a young Carpenter one day I showed up didn't have my tools he Mike showed up on the job and I said hey Mitch throw me your Hammer hey Tom throw me your tape measure he said what you don't have your tools I forgot them he says well why don't you go home and get them and forget about the rest of the day because you should not come to to work without your tools amen and you shouldn't come to church without your sword that's right amen amen I realize some of you got it digitized you might have it on a phone or whatever but I love to hear the pages turning amen read your Bible and pray amen Luke 17 vers 28 through 30 likewise also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom and rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I I believe that we are living and fulfilling the prophecy of Luke 17 and3 amen this is the day of the revealing of the son of man now uh I would like you to turn with me to two other scriptures As We Lay a foundation now for the rest of our sermon here in which we want to use as a platform so in Matthew 8 and then we'll go to Matthew 9 then we'll go to Mark 10 so in Matthew chap 8 verses 5-10 and then we'll just skip down to verse 13 Matthew 8 verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion in beseeching him so he's a gentile he's a Roman he's a Roman Centurion and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the py grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the T the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed amen now you have to have faith so that faith will speak back if you say do you see he's activating see now watch this for I am a man of authority having soldiers under me and I say unto this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel what amazing he's got disciples around him he's got followers and here is a man that says I'm not worthy for you to come under my house and I'm a man of authority so he knows how that Authority works and he recognizes that Jesus had Authority in fact the Bible says at one time he raised his hand and he said uh all Heaven and Earth and all power is now given unto me brother Brenham said if you make Jesus Christ different than God he says then there was God the Father in heaven with no power but when you have a revelation when you understand that God was changing his Mass God in Mora God above us the Old Testament he said then coming down God With Us Emmanuel and then changing his mask again God in morpa God in usj in the way of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit but he is one God now verse 13 so we can wrap this up in this portion of scripture and Jesus said unto the S Centurion go thy way as thou Hast believed so be it unto thee and his servant was healed in the self same hour now Jesus Drew attention to him and he said I've not seen such Faith No not in Israel right so the Centurion was actually activating something and God had to actually say I've Not s seen such faith now as he had told the Lord you speak the word and whatever you say it'll happen now he's activating the word he's anointing the word he's saying Lord if you'll speak to me if you understand the principle that's you don't come to church and sit there without asking you don't come to church without knocking if you have need of something you ask you seek you not because you're activating your faith and then God we'll move on the scene amen and now he tells him go thy way I don't need to lay hands on you he says go thy way as thou has believed how many of you say I believe there are times in your life when you are going to activate yes your faith amen come on Amen now let me just say this and I know I'm getting ahead of myself but I feel to say this brother Bram said the five indications of the third pull every time that it was manifested he said there was a need but I want you to know they were not in church not in a prayer line there was a need and I want all of you to understand it's going to be the same thing with you there will be a need and that need is what causes God to come on the scene because you activate your faith and I could tell every one of you if we took and gave you time to give testimony after testimony there would be times that you spoke the word you did something your kids were doing this you spoke against that guess what the kids were set free there was something inside of you that was already speaking prise the Lord the power of the spoken word turn with me to Matthew chapter 9 verses 27-30 and when Jesus departed then two Blind Men followed him crying saying thou son of David have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the Blind Men came to him and Jesus saith unto them believe ye that I am able to do this they're asking for mercy they haven't even made it known but he knows their heart amen they said unto him yay Lord he's saying do you really believe they're activating now when they said yes we believe understand that you two in the same capacity when there's something that you need from God you need to say yes Lord I believe you can do it there is power with the spoken word then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you now remember these two are Jews and the reason we know they Jews is thou son of David their approach to him is son of David Jews brother Bram said it's a Jewish custom yeah multitudes of quotes for them to have hands laid on them so do you believe that if I do this yay Lord we believe he touches them and the Bible says and they said to him yay Lord then he touched their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open and Jesus straightly charged them saying see that you know that no man know it you know there are times when there are great Miracles done and you will find throughout your scripture in Jesus says don't tell anybody what just happened because you can tell them they won't believe it anyway that's right so according to your faith be it unto you mark chap 10 so let's go now to another portion of scripture Mark 10: 46 a very familiar portion of scripture in fact brother Brenham preaches about blind bmus multitudes of times and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples a great number of people blind bmus the son of tus Sat by the Highway side begging and when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace and he cried the more a great deal the son of David have mercy on me see some people will tell you hey shut up he's not going to listen to you on but when there's something inside of you and you have a need hey the more people it doesn't matter who it is that tries to silence you speak up let God know and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him What wilt that I should do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole than amen and immediately he received his sight and follow Jesus in the way what do you want me to do to you Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said go thy way thy faith thy faith has made thee whole and immediately received his sight I'd like to title my sermon this morning continuing on with the thought of the revealing of the son of man this is part six and I want to take uh this direction this morning to be it unto you according to your faith now I could show you multitudes and multitudes of quotes where the prophet of God said oh you just touched him he was using my voice but it's not me it's him amen he said I've got nothing I'm just all I'm doing is allowing him to use my voice and he says really you touched him amen and I want you to understand faith is what is quickened that you touch him now sometimes there are touch points brother Brenham said at times that some people because of the way they're taught he says as an example you out there in radioland reach out right now if you have faith touch that radio you see sometimes they feel they have to do something and so brother brandham had inherited all kinds of teachings and now he's been given a a Ministry now watch out God has watched over his gift he tried smoking he tried drinking and guess what supernaturally God interceded why because he's got a prophetic Ministry now he doesn't understand he's a young boy he doesn't understand these things so uh this ministry of his is unfolding the angel said you're going to pray for kings and monarchs I'm giving you two signs a sign in the hand and discernment brother Brenham uses the terminology the first and second pull he says now I will be with you and and he says you'll have a sign in the hand he said people will come up there my hand will change a color he said now it's got nothing to do with me he said it's just a gift that I have and he told people look at my hand now it's normal but watch when I put it upon your hand he says it changes he said is that true and and he would perhaps talk them to them for a moment and he says but you see my hand is still got a wrong color to it he said your faith hasn't Rose enough yet and he would talk to him and all of a sudden he said now look at my hand thus sayith the lord it's gone see what I'm saying they what what they were doing is they were activating their faith it took something for them to see something tangible but while he was doing that there were people in the congregation they're saying oh my because brother Brenham said why you out there he's the same yesterday today and forever you don't need to come up here you don't need some man to lay hands on you if you'll believe he is here now why there's a faith Bank all through this building if you'll just believe and have faith in God hallelujah so in Psalms 107: 19 and 20 then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses you ever been there and he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions what did he send his word amen his word is God's will so he sends the word Now understand that God uses his word in multitudes of ways he can send a minister he can send a friend he can have somebody sing a song yeah sometimes it takes a mountain sometimes it takes a flood sometimes it takes all these distresses you go through cuz God needed to get your attention are you understanding me amen and so it was even in the prophet's Ministry there he was one time he went to a Pentecostal meeting came back and told hope oh my I have found some people and you know here he was Missionary Baptist you all know the story I'm not going to take the time his mother-in-law said don't you dare take my daughter to that trash how many know that so for the next year and a half or so he pulls away from it he listens to Mama I want all of you to understand the Bible says sometimes they of your own house household can become your worst enemy it says if you're going to follow Jesus there might come a time when father is against son and mother against daughter you understand that right so if you're going to follow him you've got to have the mindset even if others tell me not to go if God's calling me I'll go amen Comes the Flood you all know the story his wife is getting very sick she's actually crossed over in death he comes up to her oh Hope Oh Hope come back to me her eyes open why'd you call me back bill now here's a mother that's got two children yes and she didn't say how are my children are you taking care of them and why did you call me back bill it's just like you preached about why it's so wonderful and he says honey um you know he's talking to her a little bit and she says come here bill I want to tell you something he says I didn't come sit down I knelt down she said I know where the problem is we listen to Mama and she said on her deathbed Bill promise me you will take my children and you will raise them up amen my do you understand and so now hope passes and brother brandham you know he he he's having a hard time missing hope and then he comes and guess what they call him on the radio William brandom come to the hospital your baby's dying oh my I want you to understand now he's in a a real complex because and he said Lord I might understand you taking my wife but not my little Sharon Rose no oh God not my little Sharon Rose yeah he says I prayed he said a black sheet come down right there in front of him he said I knew God rejected me can you imagine he says there's something spoke to me see I thought I thought you said he's a good God how many of you have ever been in a time in a situation dist stressful might be family might be a death in them family might be you lose your job you might be something it just turns you upside down turns you around and you really don't know what's going on and God is trying to get your attention and he's asking God oh God not don't take my baby he's rejected he said well if that's how he's going to be all this that I've done for him and he said he he was just about ready to say well if that's how he's and he said all of a sudden how many of you have ever had that anchor hold you're about ready to say if that's the way he or if that's the way the message people or if that's the way that the message preachers or if that's the way that somebody who claims to be the bridey chrry treats me well I tell you what but something holds how many of you H have been disappointed discouraged perhaps by somebody in the message I will say this I've had multitudes of times oh yes multitudes but I've never had the message discourage me I've never had Jesus Christ he's never betrayed me he's never told others what I've told him in secret he's never shared hallu come on now somebody give him praise this morning because there is a friend who sticks with thee closer than a brother that's the truth he sent his word and it healed the people delivered them you see when the word has been sent to you listen to this because you're going to catch it bits and pieces of this throughout this sermon when the word has been revealed to you it has healing virtue in it amen it has Deliverance virtue in it Faith looks to the promise not to the problem Faith activated is greater than a prayer line come on amen Faith reaches out and touches him amen faith in God's word is greater than the laying on of hands because Jesus said I've not seen such great faith no not in all of Israel he's making a point if you understand God's Authority on and you understand how the God works you don't need him to go and lay hands all you need to do is say Lord I believe your word and your word says you're a Healer therefore I receive that healing virtue because by your stripes I am healed and you're now activating the word of God and God says I see Faith amen now my wife reminds me even as she sends me a text message before I preach don't go off and tell stories or you know and stay focused so I'm going to but I'm going to tell a story and it just happens to be one I've told you here before but the rest of you haven't heard it so for their sake I'll tell them brother Mike was preaching up in Flagstaff and boy it was a great sermon I believe that it really doesn't matter who it is that's preaching I believe that if you have faith in God God is obligated to to have that Minister speak something to you why it's not the man it's the gift and I tell you I was sick oh I tell you what nowadays people when they're sick they stay home it used to be in the Bible when they were sick they brought them to church they brought them through the roof when they couldn't get in they oh somebody said amen you know don't look at me like I'm crazy it used to be that when you were sick you still came now I understanding let's be politically correct if you got covid-19 stay home but you know what I mean brother Mike was preaching and oh I was sick and quite honestly I don't remember a whole lot of what he was saying I was just sitting there sweating I was ready to vomit I I I was a couple times if you've ever had that flu like symptom and I tell you what vomiting I hate to vomit and I do anything I breathe I do all this stuff because I hate to do that and I was just about ready to run I'm telling Sandy get out of the way get out of the way I'm going to run you know and I don't you know want to and I can't wait until brother Mike is done with a sermon and like many of you but what I was saying is he if he will say is there anybody here sick today oh my see what I was doing is activating my faith and I was sick I was so sick I my I I I tell you and he said if anybody is sick here he says and you feel to come down and be prayed for he says well now's your time well I'm ready to like this and as soon as I now watch here's the testimony as soon as I stood up I was healed amen hallelujah it immediately left me I didn't have to go forward yeah all I did was say because my my my Faith was reaching out if he'll just say stand up come forward whatever and as soon as I stood up because I knew the daddy was there on the scene hallu have you ever been in a situation and if Dad is there or when Daddy walks through the door everything's okay now Dad's here he can handle it I felt like he's here all of a sudden I just completely I knew it I quit sweating I uh the the nausea left me I just was immediately healed God you know Jesus said many times rise and be healed the rising the rising was causing the healing because you were activating your faith on God's word he sent his word and it healed them amen hallelujah amen now remember brother Brenham said there was one scripture that he says I stayed away from as a young man because I never understood it I'm going to read this scripture Mark 11: 20- 23 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember saith unto him Master behold the frig tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answering saith unto him have faith in God wow for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the see thou shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen now there's power with the spoken word that's right in fact they begin to catch this with brother Brenham and they said brother Brenham this third pull is it got anything to do with speaking the word absolutely speak to the the storm speak to the huh squirrel speak speak speak there's power in the spoken word so brother Brenham said I can never preach on that because I didn't fully understand it now let me show you here how he explains this in 1958 in a sermon Escape hither and come quickly notice Cain's people Cain's people were smart science IST people can's people was religious had big churches educated Scholars they went to working in science they brought out metal they built houses they were great Builders and great things look at it today look on the other side how religious they are but the people that went into the ark was the people who were humble Farmers on the other side the great intellectual conception when the true of God has the revelation of Jesus Christ not written word not by written word but by spiritually revealed truth because you can have the word and if it's not spiritually revealed to you it remains a closed book that's right amen oh blessed be his name God reveals himself to an individual and he quickly becomes deity on the inside of him he's a son or daughter of God speak to this mountain don't doubt it'll move you get it see so here was brother Brenham early part of his ministry in fact what's the first sermon that we have recorded every time you research the message what's the first sermon that brother we have on archive tapes faith is the substance can you imagine of 1100 plus tapes the first one you think it's coincidence he said faith is a substance amen and so now he begins to to preach on that so I want to just go on to bring this out because when the Apostle Paul was saying I want to by God's grace and if he'll help us I want to go beyond the doctrine of laying on of hands and of Faith towards God and these things he said if God permits now imagine there was somebody there there was probably all kinds of preachers that were freaking out saying what he don't believe in those things anymore let's go beyond the doctrines of Christ oh my goodness he's trying to get them to a higher understanding have faith in God did you know that God had to Blind him to open his eyes that's right sometimes God's got to do something drastic to you yes Amen to get your attention God blinds his eyes here's this high-tempered hooknose Jew going along putting people in prison holding the coats of those that stone stepen and he's he's persecuting and he's and guess what God Appears to him and blinds his eyes he falls off and into the dust he goes sometimes God's got to grind you into the dust oh God oh God why are you doing that yeah it's our purpose I have appeared unto thee for a purpose blinded him and there he's got to be L around oh God and now he's very Hey listen when something like that very drastic happens to you you start catching up on your prayer life how many of you know that when immediately something happens oh my oh God oh God Let's Make a Deal huh yeah if you'll deliver me oh God I'll be better I I promise you see so now watch this brother Brenham in the healing of gyrus daughter see well she Stoops down and got away from that fellow moved over here here stood the general board so there she had trouble again so she slips on down where the fisherman was and here she comes crawling up between her feet moving up like that look up and see where who's that and she touched His Garment and said that's just all I need so she went on about there and she said oh I'm so thankful I'm Healed for she felt in her body something done uh something way down in here said that's enough that's all you need oh little woman crawl the same way tonight through every uh old long robed demon of doubt that stands around and tells you the days of Miracles is passed you got to come up to the platform you got to have hands laid on you crawl right but between there until you touch His Garment and when you touch him something will happen down here that says I don't need to get to the platform don't need nothing now watch what happens then watch what he'll do Jesus turned around and looked around and said who touched me when you reach out by faith and touch him demons move devils are cast out Deliverance is brought yes he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen those vindications of the third poll were sovereignly given they weren't in church they weren't in a prayer line it was under circumstances of a daily life amen is that right I want you to understand that a lot of times people are thinking for great big things to happen in the church yeah but listen God comes and speaks to you in all your circumstances Lord sometimes it'll come to you even by a mother's intuition that's right mothers you've got children they're all different ages and different personalities and temperament this one sister they had a this was out in the the backside of the peaks of FL staff and Johnny Dalton he had his wife there Kathy and they were out playing and the kids were playing hide and go seek and they had taken an old refrigerator you remember the kind of refrigerators you got the lock on the front there and you pull it and it opens up well the refrigerator quit working so they took it and just like you do when you're out there and you got a piece of land and you don't have time to take it to the dump you just put it on your your property and the whole property looks like a dump so the kids are playing they're hiding behind this and that and one of the little boys he reached and and opened that refrigerator this is a good place to hide and he took it and he pulled the door shut now imagine now there was no Panic Button there was no way to release from the inside and and Kathy here's her testimony she said I was was just washing dishes or doing something and something said something's wrong and she immediately as a mother will do she thought my children kids what all are you doing we're playing hide and seek and she's where and she's looking for all of the children and and different ones are coming out from here and there but she can't find one and she says oh where is he oh please come out where are you and finally she comes over to the refrigerator opens the door and the little boy had turned blue and he was lost his oxygen he was unconscious and he fell out of the refrigerator can you imagine there are times that you will be given intuitions you'll be given knowledge you'll be given that spirit of discernment yes you will know there will be times in your life that God sovereignly imagine had she not felt this she would have just well you kids just go inad and play and they'd have never found him until he was gone but he just started breathing again oh my let me tell you that'll cause a Revival when you say oh my what what could have been how many of you know that you have diverted emergencies you have diverted a catastrophe because you saw some little child going up a ladder reaching over one to touch something that was electrical and I trust that those kids are learn first time obedience too I said don't touch that watch this huh come on you learn first time obedience that's what God does God is a first time obedient God I said the day that you eat thereof oh no I really didn't mean that threatening repeating parent you're a liar amen you kids watch this you parents you tell your kid you get out of bed one more time I'm going whip you five minutes later they get out of bed well I'll tell you well Mommy Mommy I need a drink we'll get a drink and stuff but if you get out of bed one one more time next time you know hey uh whatever the excuse and you let him get away with it you're a liar amen and the kid's got you figured out cuz if all of a sudden you say hey what did I tell you come over here quack quack quack quack yeah that's what I said I said get out of bed one more time so God didn't say oh Adam and Eve I'm sorry oh you poor little things he said did you eat of the tree that I told you not to eat of cast out of Eden the day you eat is the day you die you understand that I don't know why I threw that in there but some of you parents need a little bit of teaching Growing Kids God's way amen your little kiddos are getting away with all kinds of stuff and back talking you and you think it's cute when they're little you let them be become a teenager huh you can't tell me what to do my mother I tell you what my mother and she wasn't a Christian not raised up like we are my mother would look at me and she'd say wipe that look off of your face or I'll wipe it off for you she says you got a bad attitude well I'm an attitude of Jester huh any of you got a huh I tell you what when our children went to church and Sandy I tell you what she wasn't always when the kids fuss and everything and and give them a treat to go outside they got you figured out mama okay give them this they throw the toy like this finally they take him out so you go into the the Pamper room or whatever and you go over there and next thing you know the kids are running around and playing you're rewarding them Sandy took our kids out a few times and they found out they didn't want to go out and then they started fussing around and we used to lay him down in church you remember that brother Mike we'd lay the kids down okay hey if the kids got to go to sleep that we lay them on the on the floor and those kids would go to playing and they want a truck and sandd look at him and she'd do this do you know what that means my kids knew come on sometimes my brother and sister we let our children get awake because you think well I don't want to be too hard on them there may come a time when your little child is going out there and brother Ram says you see little Johnny heading for the street and there's cars and trucks running up and down and and he says now if you're a real loving mother oh Johnny don't go towards the street oh my cute little baby whom the world revolves around stop no I guarantee hey Johnny Johnny I said stop right now huh or they use your full name Ronald Allan Peterson I knew here's stood up it's even standing on top of my head right now woo I knew I was in trouble but you might save your child's life that's right by teaching them when I say come come you understand okay that that that that that that's just a little teaching lesson there uh it's free it's okay take it if you think you're you're okay and your kids are fine I I I pray you're teaching them and raising them correctly amen now watch this every one of those five indications of the third pool it was the need that brought the situation to a climax it was sovereignly given it wasn't something out there in fact he says Oh my he says here I am fishing and he says something is telling me there's going to be a resurrection now this is hours before he's just feeling well maybe Joe he's he he had a little kid 2-year-old boy and the little kidney he he suffocated it it died okay he said maybe a little kitten maybe this in that well that that brother catches that fish pulls the innards out of it throws it out there he said we cut two or 300 of those things we cut them up and used them for bait the day before why would God be interested in a little tiny Blu Gill you shot your last wad he sitting there and all of a sudden presence of God said speak to that little fish a fish he says oh my a fish he said I got 50 lunatic children right now in hospitals that need to be prayed for and he says and God told me speak that little Fish Little Fish in the name of Jes Jesus Christ I give you your life back all of a sudden down he goes hey I guarantee it if you'd have been in the boat and you'd have been there you wouldn't have thought no big deal well the fish wasn't really dead it just kind of some kind of you know how fish you throw them in a in a boat and they sit there and flop around and throw them back in the water they might revive all a sudden they go down so what I'm saying God sovereignly doing something that is so far beyond what our human thinking would be why would God waste his energy on a little fish because his eyes is on a sparrow tell me he doesn't watch over [Applause] you now watch he's telling these stories to had he right he's telling a story about speaking of squirrel in fact the most detailed version of the squirrels you will find on the sermon speak to the mountain speak to this mountain he gives a very very detailed in fact you know he speak squirrels into existence two times one are gray squirrels one are red squirrels one in Indiana the other in Kentucky but what's amazing after he gives all these details he says so he says Lord is this what you've been trying to get my attention on this is the change in my Ministry why this is the first time it's used on human beings he's talking about wow had he right got so inspired watch this and and brother and sister may I admonish all of you right now that there will be times when God is moving the preacher is preaching there's something you can be reading your Bible you could be listening to a sermon but there will be something that will Quicken to you and something will move inside of you and you will say that's nothing but the truth amen oh it was so pleasing to God as soon as she said it brother Bill that's nothing but the truth whipping through there he said now he said you tell Hattie right that whatever she speaks said you want your sister to be healed he said you want I I forget $10,000 put right on the table you don't think God has got a a printer in heaven that he couldn't do that for you huh he could speak it I'll tell you what he might tell you to go fishing sometime cuz if fish your catch going to have a gold coin so you can pay your taxes Hallelujah God can do anything but anyway what I'm saying as soon as she said what is it that you want hadie I want my two sons and that all of a sudden the spirit of God Came Upon them and they come in and get right that didn't say they're going to be bride because I want to ask you where are they today where's all their testimonies are they preachers do they have churches what I'm saying saints of God is he said I give you your two boys Now understand the sovereignty of God okay understand that God he can do anything now they made those things right because mama said that's nothing but the truth and some of you parents have such a hard time with kids because I'll tell you what and you that have the little toddlers right now you're fixing to be humbled cuz your kids are going to grow up and if you were a hard nut to [Applause] crack apple don't fall far from the tree so just remember that when you go to dealing with your kids because kids will humble you they will they will mine have humbled me but you know you know what they're still mine that's right and I got one right now that's not coming to church and he knows better he was here he was with us there's not a day I don't think of him in my last physical sitting down with him I said son there'll never be a day but what dad comes to the door and said when's he coming home that's what the prodigal father did he looked out and all of a sudden there so you know what I'm I'm you don't think I go through this you don't think that it hasn't humbled me you don't think that I wore the shame but I say this so you parents are understand how do I deal with it I am not looking at the problem I am looking at the promise he is coming there'll come a time and I can promise you there'll come a time when you will see him come and get right with God and make things right why cuz I've already spoken and I believe it why he's a Son of God praise God and some of you parents let me say this some of you parents because you you've got testimon extreme testimonies I went through this I did this I went over here I did that and everything so then you have a a whole C of quail in your family you got all these little kids and they're growing up well guess what they hear your testimony than you I ain't done anything wrong what do I need to get saved from it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance you know what some of them are they're just working on their testimony now if they're Gods God hey papa God Papa God's going to get a hold of when he does he did Billy Paul put him on his on his deathbed he said oh my tried to get a hold of daddy daddy ain't nowhere to be found he said he said Son you remember the angel that you saw in that room yeah same one that came to me while I was out hunting said go to Billy he's dying he come into the room Oh Daddy it's going to be over now now you can pray for me he said no I ain't going to pray for you said you did the S and you do the praying you turn around walked out sometimes it's what you have got to make right with God now I tell you I have and Sandy I'm sorry I've kind of taken a few and told a few of these stories I know you'll tell me again don't do that and everything see um Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so let's go on here I want to uh so he's talking about a change of ministry he preaches sermons on it change of ministry present stage of my Ministry because the word is unfolding to him and it says the angel said as long as you hold on to the first B what is the first first pull healing signed in the hand what is the second pull discernment right so he says as long as you hold on to the first the second can't come you hold on to the second the third can't come and guess what bill you got to be a whole lot more sincere he said that third pole the revealing of the word the son of man the Seven Seals opening he is those seals do you understand when you when you catch this ministry of the Prophet it's totally unfolding and you've got to unfold with it and if you think brother brenon because he says oh my would have made a horrible mistake I went and looked over my notes in all the sermons prior to the opening of the first seal the mighty conqueror who is this white horse rider we all know who it is it's Jesus Christ then he opens the first seal oh my as 100 miles from the truth so the word comes he sent the word and corrects the prophet do you understand he says oh it it bears that we must wait before God trying not going by carnal knowledge not by carnal understanding not by hislop's to Babylons or any of that he says I waited before God and he said oh my the first seal who is it it's the Antichrist amen wow yeah now I've had some tell me well it's both you tell your kids that and they think you're nuts it can't be both so the prophet when he preached something that wasn't exactly right God is obligated to come and preach excuse me teach his Prophet a lesson so he comes lip to ear yeah no that's the Antichrist that's that nickan spirit now watch this you talk about power in your voice pergan Church age brother brenman is quoting Romans 8 verse 9 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that's exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same what's he say as deity speaking Every Mountain has got to go Satan cannot stand before that man I want you to understand listen my brother my sister it is not you just all of a sudden getting inspired and you know what you know that new car I've been wanting Lamborghini I speak it in the name of Jesus that's not God's will so the Bible says sometimes when you pray you pray you miss H you know what you might have wanted a Lamborghini and he gave you a Volkswagen you understand so it's praying according to God's will not according to your desire that's right amen the same as deity speaking understand Hallelujah you got to have faith in God it is faith that operates the gift in your life to make manifestations no speak no action no manifestation very good he spoke to the word and the word spoke back to him because faith became activated and it was be it unto thee according to thy faith now watch this here's in the sermon conferences 1961 brother Brenham I've tried to get the Holy Ghost I sought God I've sought God I I can't get the Holy Ghost let's have a conf conference then and find out what's wrong holy spirit's a revealer of the secrets of the heart Bible said so let's find out what's wrong let's see what's the reason you didn't receive the Holy Ghost find out what's wrong let's have a conference Moses had a conference and waited until he got orders I'm against a lot of this super D super duper Divine Healing they have in the land today this 1961 yeah this super duper Divine Healing they have in land today you might not like me after this remark but I'm going to say it anyhow they got so much super duper stuff oh Divine Healing everybody only thing you have to do is hallelujah is have hands laid on you oh glory to God that's not so repent and get right with God that's what we need more repentance amen do you see where he's putting the emphasis not this super duper he says you know what I've done remember William brandham you went out here and taught Pentecostal preachers you tried to teach them Supernatural things but they're Pentecostal babies right well I show you how to fish watch this first second pull and everything huh sh you're getting your line all tangled up in times like this quit trying to tell everybody quit trying to teach it he said now this time that third P sh don't tell nobody this a secret this time when you cast that word out there let it run real deep and you guys that know how to fish he said you don't want that little fish you bump it next thing you know you let Let It Go deeper Let It Go deeper Peter have you caught any fish no cast The Net one more time we fished all night but at Thy word watch this at Thy word so now he obeys the word he cast and guess what he got a whole shipload worth of fish understand that God is trying to get us to rise our faith higher than all of the stuff we've been taught do you understand oh my that's what you don't hardly hear preachers telling people to repent anymore huh in the day when the son of man is being revealed here we are living in that day in Matthew 9 verse 27 and when Jesus departed then two Blind Men come crying saying thou son of David have mercy believe that I'm able to do this we read the scripture I wanted to read it again yay Lord then he touched their eyes and according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open Jesus straightly charged him saying that no man know it it's your faith in God that causes the miracle why I I looked up I typed in throughout the message you find out according to thy faith 75 different quotes he says you didn't touch me be it unto you according to your faith you didn't touch me why God just used my voice don't you understand the gift that the prophet of God had of the first and second pull got the attention of the people but he said now watch it's Faith out there for everyone that comes up here he said there's 50 out there that's catching it amen he said it's my Ministry I'm to pray for the sick that's what I do I'm getting the attention of the people but watch when he goes into uh end time evangelism guess what it it ain't to the denominations no more look at it he's not he doesn't go out there to him anymore in fact he says you know what all these years of my going out here in Durban South Africa and all of the big meetings where thousands upon thousands of people come he says it's never been God's perfect will he said I've worked in the permissive will of God how many of you have studied this you know he says you know what I've done I've mixed evangelism with a prophetic gift said what Good's it done I tell this guy his name where he's from his address I'm not making fun of that I'm just saying brother Bram said what good has it done I tell all these guy I tell one guy all these things and the next guy God doesn't show me and one guy thinks I'm a God the next guy thinks I'm a devil he said what Good's it done as far as I'm concerned he said I got a complex I lost the feeling for the people how many of you know that he said well I'm going up in the mountains up there in Canada I always wanted to be a Trapper grow my hair long he said and when God wants to give me thus sayith the Lord I come stomping out and tell him thus sayith the Lord go back up in the mountain he said yeah you do your wife will leave you and you'll become a bomb you remember even the vision and different thing remember those two guys eating there right next to him and one guy lets out a big old belch brother R said there's a he tells Billy Paul there's a real man since wind is belching make you a man it's just this guy he was just a big rough tough guy the next thing you know it looked like he and Fletcher Bry God was showing him he said oh my is this is this what it's going to happen to me yeah your wife will leave you you think this is what you want and he said I've got to go sermon standing in a gap i' I he says I got to go and get alone with God that I get that feeling back because you know what pretty soon even pastors go through it you go through it well if that's the way the people are going to be if that's the way my brother if that's the way that sister or whatever I'm staying out of church ain't hurting nobody but you huh what if your Mansion is next to theirs in heaven what are you going to do have a bigger wall let me tell you we need to get along here first so that we can get along over there now now watch this in Divine Healing 1954 four he says they give out hundreds of cards or more and the only legitimate way you could do it when you got an audience like this maybe tonight 3,000 people or more uh then you you got to everybody maybe 2,000 wants to be prayed for who's going to be first well now especially my type of ministry watch this my type of ministry there's just going to be so many of them get to come but it's not by my me laying hands on the person it's you accepting the presence of Jesus Christ am that's what does the healing amen and many times you'll be watching in the meetings there's more gets healed out in the audience without a prayer card what's he doing he's saying hey God called me to pray for the sick that's part of my Ministry but I want to take the bride to a higher level watch this many times you're watching the me there's more gets healed out in the audience without prayer cards than there are those who come to the platform with prayer cards it's just where because you got to have faith to work on you got one person here maybe with faith where you got maybe two or 300 sitting out there with faith yeah see and it's been in the meetings I got letters from letters from De Moine the stomach trouble left all kinds of diseases left the people after we were gone just a Vindication of the presence of the resurrected Lord Jesus didn't happen right then right they were out there and guess what they were healed he sent his word and it healed the people he said that's how my Ministry is a couple people come up here have faith in God why now you out here sis yeah you right now God's yeah you said you and and the one next to you and the one behind you and everything like that why faith is all over the building what was he doing you see he was bringing you back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers getting you back to a higher level it's not the prayer line it's not the laying on of hands it's according to your faith amen are you following me nothing wrong with those things but the Apostle Paul was not putting it down he said go higher and we'll go there to a place of perfection if God will permit it it's a revealing of the son of man as Moses was given two signs you'll be given two signs here in the sermon speak to this mountain in San Jose I want to show you so now anytime that an emergency c um arises like that and he had an emergency he said I'm sorry I'm late to the pulpit anyway I'll pass that up we try to talk to them in order to build a faith around them just watch the greatest part of the testimonies that come to me in my meetings is from people who are healed right out in the meeting there's not many that get to me here at the platform for me to pray for are you guys seeing that look at my Ministry he said those that don't get to me up here at the platform look at those out there and here's where all the testimonies come I love to pray for people that's my Ministry but there's not too many that I get to personally it's the Holy Spirit their faith that rises in them out there then they get healed are you following it he's showing us very plainly after Services my office can tell you hundreds of letters pour in from places where we've been uh of people blind maybe sitting in a meeting went home just thinking about it a week later receive their sight or walking out on the street and something happened and uh crippled set in a wheelchair all once get up and start running see sometimes God cannot answer spontaneously yeah how many knows that remember Daniel I prayed and I believe it was 21 days or something like that before the angel could get to him but he finally gets around see just leave it alone and so many testimonies we could tell of hundreds and hundreds of things that happened that way am see we do not what we call major on Divine Healing because Divine Healing is a minor amen and you cannot major on a minor you know that so the great thing that we're after for any Revival is to bring lost souls to Christ first brother Warren when you go to the Philippines yes we want people to be healed but you know what when people come to Christ because we're trying to get the last one so we can get out of here amen we're not going to get out of here until the last one's healed comes in until the last one comes in so repent get things right with God look at this he says so the great thing that we're here for any Revival is bring lost souls to Christ revive the church back into a spiritual condition to where it should be close communion with God bring Fellowship among the churches third and fourth pray for the sick that's what I right he puts it way back down the line hey even Fellowship among churches you don't hardly see that much anymore right used to have a convention and you know what people close their church and everybody come over and stuff no now no day no way they just don't do it my brother my sister our maturity should be that I can fellowship with anybody and even if you don't see it the way that I see it I'm not going to count you out because what if the last minute God opens their eyes how long does it take for they have to get right with God Split Second Split Second twinkling of an eye let's go so hey you know what I don't look to others I Look to Christ Amen brother renam said let's go to a higher come up hither John was told by the Spirit come up hither John because I want to show you things to come to pass understand the ministry amen look I'm just going to go on here amen it's according to your faith you give me a couple minutes here stop here for a moment when God speaks he appears and when God appeared to Abraham it caused him to manifest his revelation every time God appeared to Abraham he pulls another word attribute out of him in Genesis 12 God speaks to him to move out of his country and his own family he moves by faith to seek a city whose Builder and maker is God so now he starts moving what's he doing he's walking by faith is that right God Appears to him and he builds an altar and an altar is a place where you make a sacrifice brother Bram said an altar is a type of church so Abraham now Builds an altar and he goes to church why God's appearing to him it was the appearing that caused him to do it it'll cause you and every believer let me tell you you don't belong staying home by yourself you belong in a church somewhere having fellowship with the saints of God Amen the word appear in Hebrew this is good is raw r a a raw it means to see to discern to experience or to catch the vision so when you when God Appears to you wow I discern I catch the vision I see some my eyes come open what do you think that the third pull is it's an eye openening experience but don't forget there's two in the Bible that opens eyes right God and the devil because didn't Satan say in the garden don't you want to be like God don't you want your eyes open sin is an eye opening experience so a false Revelation is just as stimulating as a true one false wine cheap wine will make you just as drunk as good wine right so understand we need God God give me true Revelation okay amen so appearing is when God comes to you he makes you understand something and it manifested in your life if you say that God has been revealing himself to you and you remain the same it's no revealing it's knowledge and knowledge doesn't change you right because there are some in the Bible that says and they're ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth that's why our kids unless they're converted unless they're born again they cannot understand the kingdom of God period you must be born again every time God Appears to his children he's doing he's pulling another word attribute out of you Abraham God Appears to him pulls an attribute next thing he goes to church next thing he's having communion with God see remember Genesis 18 God Appears to him in the plains of memmory he has foot washing and communion and he pays ties what is it God's appearing to him so now he's giving back to God do you understand when we come to church you know what you come here for God to appear to you for God to speak to you for God to give you a revelation for you to come a little bit higher and go oh wow God you were talking to me this morning oh my you gave me a direct word what was he doing he's bringing a manifestation of his virtue out of you musics come multitudes of God appearing down through the scriptures multitudes God Appears here God Appears there and when he does he's causing them to have a manifestation in their lives appears in a pillar of fire of whirlwinds burning bush small still voice and he says there's many appearing how many of you know that in the sermon convinced and then concerned give you a couple more quotes and I'll I'll let you go there's a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming 1962 there's two different words means two different things the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord now the appearing of the Lord is now somebody say now that's what's happening right now the appearing of the Lord the appearing of the son of man what's he doing he's revealing himself when he appearing when he's appearing in his people his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the Rapture wow for the coming of the Lord to catch away is bride see the appearing in the coming right he's appearing now to get you ready so that he can come and catch you away hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord for the appearing Time After Time God Appears makes himself known to you and when he does what he's doing he's bringing another attribute of himself out of [Music] you how many of you believe we're coming to Perfection I've got some quotes on it but here I I'll save it for another time Jesus said be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect he said we're not talking about a Perfection here in this physical flesh why is because this body that you have is a byproduct of sin and God will not allow your body this physical body could to come into His divine presence so in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall all be changed he said God's not going to allow this Mortal sinful byproduct of sin to come into His presence so we're going to drop this and then we have another body not made with him and he says and we'll catch that the off anybody amen huh amen wow you talk about an exciting time to be living amen we've seen his appearing he's still appearing yes he's still revealing he's still coming to you he's still speaking to you he's still drawing his attributes out of you you're becoming more like him and if you're not something's wrong is that right because if Revelation is coming to you greater and you are not manifesting that Revelation it's knowledge and knowledge puffeth up just makes you proud and arrogant you have a religious spirit if somebody don't see it like you do well then you cut off Fellowship brother Bram said one guy said he's coming on a white horse and another said he's coming on a white cloud he said what difference does it make he said as long as we agree he coming amen God help us to have that mature Faith huh have faith in God understand that the greatest thing that all of you can have is faith faith will move mountains faith will speak those things that are not as though they are this is not the power of positive thinking no this is actually things Abraham called those things which were not as though they were God can't change it until you speak it you got power with [Music] God tell your children say you know what I got enough religion for all of us and said you may not feel like you're coming right now but you will if you have to learn a hard lesson you will because Papa God knows how to get your attention you can run but you can't hide amen that's why my brother and sister even my Ministry I see is changing I'm not trying to convince everybody or even tell people hey you know what if they no longer believe that brother braham's a [Music] prophet I can't change their mind I just feel bad that for some reason they didn't catch the revealing of the son of man I can't turn away from it amen I'm consumed by it I am I am so glad of what God has done he's opened my eyes Lord and now I see wow it wasn't brother Brenham no it was a son of man revealing to me the son of man brother Ram said can't you get it Square now don't look to me I'm nothing I'm just your brother he said it's him he's the one revealing these things he's the one that's revealing these Mysteries and these secrets to you amen God bless you let's stand together this morning [Music] it's already done hallelujah it's already done prise the Lord the battle is over and the Victory is one it's already done I'm already [Music] healed heal Hallelujah I'm you praise the Lord the battle is over and the Victory is done [Music] heavenly [Music] father I would ask Lord Jesus even in my own [Music] Ministry help me to look for that last elect seed brother Bram said said there may be that last one and he said takes a long time for them to recognize who they are maybe that one is here this [Music] morning and I say this and may I have every head bow and every eye [Music] closed and there's been somebody here that you've been [Music] struggling maybe you're a young person you don't understand Mom and Dad you don't understand this rules and regulations and to you it's all law he said I'm struggling and I don't understand and you'd like me to just pray for you raise up your hand right now that's it God bless you God bless you yeah uh-huh you've been struggling that's good it's good for you to struggle you need need to struggle Reverend Mr Lily not going to be easy he said it's going to be hard you're going to struggle but if you need him and you want Christ more in your life right now then you just say father I claim it right now and you forgive me for my doubts and you forgive me I don't understand but God if I don't know you how can I love love you forgive me for just being carnal but I don't know to be anything else come come and let him speak to your heart just be honest with him I think everyone in here could raise our hand and say we need to be better we need to be more consecrated we need need to be more sincere I'm going to raise both of my hands this morning and say oh [Music] God I need more of you I can't do it without you but with you I can do all things which it's Christ that strengthens me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so father God I bring these that have raised their hands they've admitted I'm having a heart time I'm struggling that's good you need to struggle you need to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it wasn't until Jacob wrestled he struggled with the angel then his life was changed amen father God I pray these that have raised their hand that you would reveal yourself to them Father they're being honest with you they don't understand how can they serve you if they don't know you how can they love you until you reveal yourself to them Father I bring each one of these and I bring this whole congregation Yes Lord From The Elder to the youngest I bring every one of them including myself and say father continue to work with us forgive us of carnalities forgive it of us of our humanness and like Abraham who struggled and walked for years and years in the promised son finally come and you ask him to kill it oh God and he struggled but he overcome when he said I believe your word amen that if I destroy my son you'll raise him up because I and the lad will return amen he already spoke it he already he said it but he had to go through the battle it's already hallelujah it's already done Praise of the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is already his word hallelujah and if you believe it have fa God praise the Lord the is over and the Victory is one [Music] done yes it's already done Hal hallelujah it's it's already done we sing praise the Lord the battle is over and the Victory already you see that power what you're doing you're confessing his word cuz he reveals it to you brother Brenham says Time After Time thousands of times why he can't heal you he's already healed you Hallelujah he said he paid the price of Calvary the blood was shed you're already healed amen he said you you just have to have faith and let it be quickened amen and then you can say because now he said God is helpless to bring to you that healing until you put it on the confession of your lips and you confess it and then he says watch the Holy Spirit enforce that in your life amen I'm already he Hallelujah I'm already praise the Lord and the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done it's already done brother Robert Hallelujah It's Already Done praise the Lord and the landle is over the victory is won it's already
