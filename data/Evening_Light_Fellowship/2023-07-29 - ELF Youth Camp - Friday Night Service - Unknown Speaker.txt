know we want to keep a testimony before the camp here and we want to be known as uh uh a people that in a camp that pick up after themselves uh now some of you have done an excellent job even last night as we were cleaning up in the back here there was some of you that were going under the tables and picking up three or four water bottles and and different things let's let's not leave it up to just the same three or four people but take a little bit of responsibility take a little bit of pride in yourself and say well uh instead of just walking past an empty water bottle that you know has been there for a little while hey instead of leaving it for somebody else take two seconds pick it up empty it out if there's water in it throw it in the trash easy right will you guys do that you know why I want you to do it because it saves me doing it many hands make light work okay so let's do our due diligence let's pick up trash after ourselves um also we have noticed there's uh a lot of things that we see laying around purses handbags cell phones there was uh uh somebody had lost her cell phone I had it all day and I was like how does somebody not know that they lost their cell phone so it just goes to show that they were doing what they were asked and they were not looking on their phone and all these different things so if you have lost something the lost and found is in this room right here we've set up a table and um if we see something laying around or whether it's a little purse a handbag a cell phone uh cash whatever it may be we're gonna pick it up and we're gonna put it in this room right here uh okay Saturday schedule if we could have Saturday schedule por favor mucho gracias hermano thank you Saturday's schedule our optional devotion that everybody goes to is going to be in the cafeteria at 7 00 A.M and let me just say this um let me give you as many youth that have showed up to a devotional in a very very long time and so how about you give yourselves a big old Round of Applause [Applause] sure it's very encouraging to see you guys there and even this morning 6 30 we were over here and reading our Bible and I thought well we'll see how many people show up there was 30 people showed up for a little time of uh prayer and just individual reading our Bibles and I was just so blessed to see that and even some of the sisters they got together and they had their own little devotional and so you see when the word Goes Forth the word challenges our hearts and so we can see now that you're responding to the challenge and so as the word Goes Forth even this evening and it challenges your heart Meet The Challenge and put it into action amen God bless you that really encouraged us uh breakfast 8 A.M to 8 40 will have devotions with your counselors that'll be 9 to 10 a.m each of you know who your counselor is is in your dorm you'll have they have a little thought that they've put together sharing a little something from their hearts and it has always been a real blessing especially for the young people and the more that you guys put into that devotion the better the devotion is going to be uh all girls paintball briefing 10 to 10

you know today was a time to play we had fun we had activities you bonded you had you made friendships with the people within your group but that was earlier this is now that was already in the in the present time and the same effort that you guys put into history a few hours ago we want you to put the same effort into the service this evening so as you hear the word go forth don't be scared to say
