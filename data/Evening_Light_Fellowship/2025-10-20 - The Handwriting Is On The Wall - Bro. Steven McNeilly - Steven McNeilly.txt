But Lord, as we look at ourselves through your eyes, Lord God, there's a totally different life, Lord God, help us all to see ourselves, Lord God, the way you see us, Father. Oh Lord, what a difference, Lord. May you give us that revelation, Lord God, to see ourselves, Lord, as you see us, Lord. To see one another as you see us, Father. Lord, there's many prayer requests this morning. Lord God, we know that you're mindful of them all. Lord God, you knew what they would be before the foundation of the world. Lord God, you knew that each one of us would be here this morning before the foundation of the world. So Lord, we just know that all things are in your hands, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you said for us to ask &gt;&gt; that it be given to us. &gt;&gt; And you told us to ask abundantly &gt;&gt; that our joy might be full, Lord God. So we lift these up, Lord God, before our sisters and brothers, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Father, you have your ways, Lord God. You designed it to be the way that it is, Lord God. for us to be that mouthpiece, Lord God, when you would have us to be, Lord, even as you would move upon us or call upon us, Lord God. It's fallen my lot this morning, Lord, to speak for these, to lift these up before you in prayer, to bring them before you, Lord. So do we, Lord, humbly, Lord God. Lord, knowing that we can do nothing within ourselves, Lord God. And that's why we look unto you, Lord God, for all our needs. Father, may you touch each one of these, Lord, in a gentle and kind way that only you can, Lord God. May you heal our healing needed, Lord God, both spiritually and naturally. Father, thank you for being with Brother Ron and Sister Sandy, Brother Mario, his wife. Lord, I'm sure, Lord God, you use them to touch lives. Father, &gt;&gt; may you bring them home safely, Father. &gt;&gt; May you bless us in this service this morning, Lord. May you anoint the speaker, Lord God. And may you anoint our ears to hear and our hearts to receive, Lord God. Let us not come in vain, Lord, but leave here better Christians than when we came. for thy glory and honor.

Father God, &gt;&gt; you art holy, Lord. Father, our holiness, our righteousness is as filthy rags, but Lord, we're not depending upon our own righteousness this morning, but we're depending upon thy righteousness and thy holiness. And so, Father, we just ask this morning that you would come by and speak to our hearts, Lord. Teach us from your word, Father. May we recognize the day and the hour in which we're living in. And may we see Lord that there's the handwriting, Father, is on the wall this morning. And may we have a spiritual understanding, Lord, to be able to read the handwriting and to understand it, Father, that we might know how to prepare our lives. Lord, we love you. We thank you. We commit all things into thy hands for thy kingdom's glory. Let everything be said and done in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you this morning. We welcome you to the house of the Lord and it's always an honor and a privilege to be here and uh to speak the word of God. If you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Daniel. Thank you musicians so much. Then we'll read uh chapter 5 and we'll start at verse five. We'll kind of skip down through this chapter here. And uh certainly enjoyed the word on Wednesday night from brother James and uh you know it's pretty pretty interesting whenever God has a channel &gt;&gt; and um you know brother Johnny Green he he he looked back to me after service and he said my that was part two of Sunday &gt;&gt; and um some have asked and and they asked well you know did did brother Stephen and brother James share notes together and um and here's the gospel truth. truth. We didn't, but we did because we have the same anointing and the same inspiration. And so last Monday before he preached, um, he told me, "Yeah, I was 5 minutes into your sermon and I turned it off because you were walking all over my notes." And, um, so we have to recognize when something like that happened that it's not just happen stance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That it's God. The Holy Spirit is trying to get something across to the people cuz God will take two men not talking to each other. Uh we're actually in we were in different parts of the country from one another but come a service after the other with the same thought with the same avenue. What is that? That's not a man. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. So now we have to be spiritually minded and ask ourselves what is God trying to get across to us through these last two services. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So I'll let you answer that question yourselves. Amen. Daniel 5 verse 5 and it says uh Belshazar the king. No this is verse one. Um, Belshazar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, that the king and his princes, his wives, and his concubines might drink therein. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his princes and his wives and his concubines drank in them. They drank wine and they praised the gods of gold, the god and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. So here they were taking vessels that were taken from the house of God that were sanctified and and set aside for God's service. And yet they were using these very vessels and making mockery out of them. They were they were drinking from these vessels and they were praising the god of gold, the god of silver, of iron, so on and so forth. And verse 5 says, "In the same hour came forth the finger of a man's hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote." Then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smoked one against the other. Let's turn down to verse 22. We'll read 22 through 31. And it says, "And thou," this is Daniel speaking to the king, "and thou, his son, O Belshazar, has not humbled thine heart, though thou kneest all this, but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven, and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives, thy concubines have drunk wine in them, and thou has praised the gods of silver, of gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear not, nor know and the God in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified. Then was the part of the hand sent from him and this right writing was written and this is the writing that was written man teel uh of farson. This is the interpretation of the thing. Man, God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Tea, thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Perez, thy kingdom is divided and given to the Mes and Persians. Then commanded Belshazar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. In that night was Belshazar, the king of the Chaldans slain, and Darius the Median, took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old. Amen. You may take your seat this morning. We'll trust that the Lord will add the blessing to the reading of his word. I would like to title my sermon this morning, The Handwriting is on the wall. The book of Daniel, it begins with Jehoak Jehookim who was the king of Judah uh in Jerusalem. And at this time of his kingship, we understand that uh Jerusalem was besieged and it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. And you know the Bible it the Bible is a book of prophecy. And we know that before this ever took place to in Jerusalem and to the king of Judah, Jehakim, it was already prophesied by the by the prophet Jeremiah of what was going to take place. For Jeremiah 25:es 8-12 says, "Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts." And we understand that whenever a prophet comes along and he says, "Thus sayaeth the Lord," we know that this is God speaking. And it has to come to pass. There is no denying it. Uh perhaps we would we would look at the the the the prophecy and we would say, "My uh this prophecy isn't coming to pass according to how we felt it should or according to the timing that we think it should." But nonetheless, when God speaks, it has to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because ye have not obeyed my words. Verse verse 9. Now behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, sayeth the Lord, and Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, a perpetual desolations. Moreover, I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon 70 years. Notice how how onpoint prophecy is. Not only does he does he use the name of the king that's going to come and take over, but he also gives a timeline of how long they're going to be in captivity for. And it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, sayeth the Lord, for their iniquity in the land of the Chaldanss and and will make it perpetual desolations. So understand that when God speaks through his prophets, it'll never fail. When God gives thus sayaeth the Lord, such and such is going to happen. And and this is going to happen. When a prophet speaks it under the inspiration of God, we know that it is God himself who was speaking through a mouthpiece because the Bible says that uh that God shall do nothing &gt;&gt; unless he first reveals his secrets onto his prophets. And so we are very wellversed and taught with prophets and we know what to look for. And that's why we can look at this this this prophet messenger that we follow by the name of William Brham and we can say this man is as surely is a prophet of God because each time that he said thus sayeth the Lord it came to pass. Therefore the Bible says if a man speaks in my name and it comes to pass hear that man &gt;&gt; because that man is my mouthpiece that man is my voice and that man has a message for you. So we understand that every time that brother Brandham was was under the inspiration of God and people would come before him and and and he would speak to them and he would and he would tell them tell them their life. He would tell them what is what's been wrong in their life that was causing a sickness or whatever it might have been. Every time he spoke and he said thus sayeth the Lord, it was never wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so, Brother Brandham would people would begin to say when he was getting to the end of his ministry, they would say, "Well, yeah, he he has a a prophetic gift. He has a gift to to to speak and to discern the hearts of the people, but in his doctrine, he's off." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say, "How does this make any sense at all? It is either all of God or none of it is of God. If it's not wrong with thus sayeth the Lord and the discernments and the prophesyings, his doctrine is not wrong either because it comes from the same spirit. It comes from the same God. Whether it's prophecy of speaking or whether it's prophesying by the word of the Lord, it's all from the same God. Therefore, one isn't right and one isn't wrong. It is all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can have trust in what he said because the vindication was never wrong. &gt;&gt; Thousands of times it happened. People would come before him and he would speak to them in the name of the Lord and it was never ever wrong. Therefore, if that was never wrong, don't let anybody try to deceive you and say that his doctrine is wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, California hasn't sank yet." It was thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; This hasn't happened over here yet, but yet it was thus saith the Lord. Therefore, we just need to be patient in our waiting. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see that Daniel and Hannah, Mishael, and Azeriah, if you don't know that, that's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. A lot of us, you know, we we we understand the the the the the uh the pagan names that were given to these brothers, but that wasn't their original names. Their original name was Hannah. Hannah, and Michel, and Azeriah, and of course, Daniel. We understand that they were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar at this time of of of the besieging of Jerusalem. And they were taken and they were taken to Babylon where they would serve Nebuchadnezzar. And these young men, though they were taken by Nebuchadnezzar, though they were taken from their homeland, and and yet they were young men, yet they had a a true revelation of who Jehovah was. They had a true revelation of what God was, of what his laws were, of what his ways were, and and a revelation of of how they were to to live their lives, and how they were to live their lives and serve God. It wasn't depending upon a geographical location. So, in other words, it didn't matter if they were in uh Jerusalem or if they were in Babylon or wherever they were uh where wherever they were in life of location, it didn't matter because they had a a true revelation of number one, who they were, &gt;&gt; number two, who God was and what his laws were. Right? &gt;&gt; Because it says in Daniel 1:8, "But Daniel proposed in his heart, purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore, he requested of the prince of the Unix, that he might not defile himself." And when Daniel was speaking, we we we understand that Daniel was the leader of of his other three brothers that were taken captive because now he he approaches the unic and he says, "Hey, we have an obligation to God. I have a revelation that there's certain meat and certain things that I'm not to partake of or to put in my body. There are certain things as as a young Jew that I'm not supposed to defile my body with. And this portion of meat and this wine and and how you're expecting me to to to live my life is not according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it didn't matter who it was at work or who it was at school or if the teachers were trying to teach them the ways of Leodysia. Let me say trying to teach them the ways of Babylon. It didn't matter where they were or if mom or dad was with them or if they were standing alone. They had a true revelation. And when we have a true revelation of who we are, when we have a true revelation of the word of God in this day, a true revelation of how we're to live our lives, it doesn't matter where God takes us. It doesn't matter our geographical location. It doesn't matter if we're at church. It doesn't matter if we're at school, if we're at work, what part of the country we are in, we'll still live the same kind of life. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steven, why is that?" Because it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation doesn't come and go with the weather. &gt;&gt; Revelation, you don't just live our lives by revelation when everything is going good and when the sun is out. No, we live our lives the same way every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't change with the group that we're around. &gt;&gt; It doesn't change with geographical location. It doesn't change when mom and dad or the pastor or preacher isn't around. No. But it's the same &gt;&gt; thing every day. The same life lived out no matter where we are or what is set before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; The problem with message believers is that we're so good at disguising ourselves and becoming chameleons. &gt;&gt; When we're when we're with the people of the world, we we learn how to fit in. And when we come to church, we we understand how to fit in. We know what to say and when to say it. We know the right kind of clothing to wear uh that's pleasing that everybody else could look at us and say, "Well, that person is doing good." But yet, I wonder how it is when we're by ourselves. I wonder the reflection of our lives of of how we treat one another and everybody else, whatever it might be, or how we how we how we project our life, the life of Christ out. I wonder with some of us, does it change according to our environment? &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Stephen, that's just for the young people." Nonsense. It is amazing what people, the uh older people will do, middle-aged people will do in order to be accepted at work, &gt;&gt; in order to get the pay raise, in order to get more money. Well, I got to provide for my family. Therefore, if I was to talk about God to to these people, I wouldn't get a pay raise. I would be an outcast. I would be this or I would be that. And therefore, we use it as an excuse to not express the love of God that's in our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is really I wasn't going to share this, but I'm going to So, we went I went with brother Amos for a a a business lunch meeting with these with these gentlemen and and they're pretty pretty wellto-d do pretty wellto-d do guys, let me say that. And so we're we're sitting at the table and uh and you know this is a business meeting. What do you talk about at a business meeting? Business. That's what it's all about. So we're sitting there and you know, brother Amos, he's just talking and all of a sudden he starts talking about the Lord and okay, well this is good and everything. So we sit down and we get get our food and stuff and I'm just kind of sitting there. there's a guy who's sitting next to me and and and brother Amos is with these other two brothers, the other two gentlemen over here and stuff. And so this guy's talking to me and um you know it was kind of hard to reel him in a little bit. Um but that's okay because I realized that afterwards that I was supposed to be there to sit next to him because he would have been interrupting this other conversation that was going on on the other side of the table. And so I'm listening and I got included a little bit in in the conversation and stuff, but you know, when my food's before me, I'm not much of a talker. Like, let's eat. I'm I'm ready to eat. And and I look and I look at brother Amos' thing and his his knife and fork is still in the napkin. And I'm thinking, this guy, he's not going to eat his food. And the more that I'm listening to the conversation, the more that he's testifying and he's talking about the grace of God and he's talking about God over here at a business meeting and he's talking about God over there and then all of a sudden the three of them have their phones out and he This is just amazing. He has them with their phones out on a Bible app reading scripture &gt;&gt; at a restaurant. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; At a business meeting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I'm thinking, "This is amazing." So I take my phone out and I'm not on my Bible app, but I'm videoing everything that's going on here because my food is done. I really enjoyed it. And so I'm just videoing these guys and I'm thinking, "This is absolutely amazing." &gt;&gt; Absolutely amazing. And I thought, here we are at a business meeting and you're supposed to be talking business in order to win more business. But here he is talking about the Lord and not caring about the business. &gt;&gt; Now, why is that? It's because he told me afterwards, you know, how can God do something for you and you not share it with other people? &gt;&gt; He didn't get so caught up with uh uh what are they going to think about me and what of this and what of that? No, there was just a love in his heart to share the gospel with these two gentlemen who ended up they were uh I think they were from Iraq and but they were Iraqi Christians. And so they started sharing stuff back and all of a sudden this this this business meeting it turned into a gospel meeting and I thought well praise the Lord. How many of us would do the same thing? How many of us when when we go to work and we have meetings and and wherever it is that life takes us on a day-to-day basis, how many of us are actually willing to step out and and share about the faith that God has placed in our hearts? Cuz the Bible says this, don't hide your light under a bushel. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it shine. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you let it shine? You let it shine by declaring the gospel of Jesus Christ. So, let me encourage you. Don't be shy and don't be scared. Don't be scared of the consequences. Cuz if you don't get a pay raise because of your love for Jesus Christ, well, so be it. &gt;&gt; If you don't get a job because of your love for Jesus Christ, so be it. &gt;&gt; You don't want that pay raise and you don't want that job anyways. &gt;&gt; Pretty amazing. We ought to have that same purpose that Daniel had in his life. Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself &gt;&gt; with the king's meat or with his wine. He told the unic, "Give me 10 days. 10 days and we'll see who's greater." the food that's anointed by God through sanctification and prayer or the food of the kings from the king's very table itself. And we all know the outcome of the story. But it came because Daniel had purposed within his heart and he had a true revelation within his heart that he was different than everybody else. That he was called to be a sanctified vessel unto God. that he was called to be set aside and ready for service for God's service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should take a leaf from Daniel's book &gt;&gt; and understand the hour that we're living in and to understand how easy it is in this this this present evil world that we're living in where Satan is the the ruler of principalities. He's the ruler of powers. He's the ruler of this of this of this earth as we know it. We have to understand that if we don't purpose within our hearts &gt;&gt; to say I am not going to be defiled by Leodysia. I am not going to be defiled by the spirits of this end time. If you don't purpose it in your own heart, you will be defiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your spirit will be defiled. Your heart will be become hardened towards God. Your spirit will be hardened towards God's word, towards God's people, to our families, to our friends, to our children and loved ones. Why? Because we lose the purpose within our hearts. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a it's like a an act of duty that we all have to perform. starting here to the very back of the church. We've got to wake up in the morning and purpose in our heart and say, "I'm not going to defile myself by unclean things. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to defile myself by by Instagram and YouTube and and all these different things." No, but I'm going to cleanse myself and I'm going to purpose to stay clean in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you don't purpose it, &gt;&gt; if you don't make that active decision &gt;&gt; and say, "This is what I'm going to do today and this is what I'm not going to let happen today." Satan Satan will take your mind and it'll become the devil's playground. &gt;&gt; Satan will take your spirit. Just watch. If you don't if you don't have the shield of faith up, if you don't have the helmet of salvation upon your head, all you got to do is go to the wrong restaurant one time and all you got to do is listen to the music and then go from there to the mall and go from there to someone somewhere else and and go from there and see all of these unclean spirits that surround us on a daily basis. Praise brother. &gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden what happens to our spirits? &gt;&gt; What happens to our heart? It becomes defiled &gt;&gt; and it becomes hardened and it and it happens and we don't even realize it. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said uh the invasion of the United States, it's not a physical invasion, but the invasion is already on. understand that Satan is the one who is invading and and and and he is taking away our joy, taking away our peace, taking away the joy of the Lord within our hearts, and we don't even recognize that it's Satan that's doing it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we've lost a purpose within our hearts to say no. We've lost a purpose within our hearts to to say, you know what? I'm going to stay clean today. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay pure. I'm going to keep my thoughts right, &gt;&gt; going to keep my heart right. I'm going to meditate upon the word of God. I'm going to sing sing the songs of Zion. I'm going to sing uh uh uh psalms and and so on and so forth. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take captive my very thoughts &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Why? How do you do it? You purpose within your heart. &gt;&gt; You make a decision. But so much of the time, you know, we're like, we're like a we're like a a log that that gets blown over into the water and it's just drifting down the water. Well, I'm a believer and praise the Lord and and God is good and I've had an experience with God and and life is good and life is fantastic and we just drift through life. &gt;&gt; We become a piece of driftwood. You know what happens to a piece of driftwood? It gets stuck. All of a sudden, there's a corner and the corner becomes tight and all of a sudden this this piece of driftwood, it gets it gets stucked and it gets jammed. Why? Why do we get stuck and jammed in our lives? We get stuck and we get jammed because we lose our purpose. We we fail to purpose in our hearts to continue with the Lord. And we might not be exactly living in sin, but we're just drifting. &gt;&gt; We're just drifting. We're just going with the flow. We're just waiting for the coming of the Lord. And in our in our waiting, we become drifters. And in our drifting, we get stuck. What happens to a piece of driftwood that gets stuck and it stays in the water for long enough? &gt;&gt; It begins to rot. True. &gt;&gt; What happens to you and I when we become drifters. Amen. And we get stuck in life. This piece of wood that was once that was once a tree. Amen. It was once a tree that was planted by the rivers of water. A tree that used to bring forth fruit. A tree that used to bring forth life. All of a sudden it's cut down. It starts drifting and it becomes rotten. &gt;&gt; Where did it start? It started when we failed to purpose. Oh, let me get the thought across to you. &gt;&gt; It started when we failed to purpose in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To stay in the word of God to live our lives according to his word and not just drift down the sea of Leodysa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Drifters. I don't want to be a drifter. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to drift through Leodysia. No. But I want to produce. I want to grow. I want to be planted by the water. I don't want to be overtaken. I want to be planted by the water. And I want to bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the only way for a piece of driftwood to get out of the water is for someone to take it out. &gt;&gt; Let's start preaching. How do we get a piece of driftwood out of the water? How we go to it? Let me say my that piece of driftwood that don't belong there. It would look better in my house. People pay big money for driftwood. Stuff like that. It's wild. But it takes somebody that understands, hey, that doesn't belong in there. There's a cause and effect because of this piece of wood that's within this water. And somebody's got to take it care enough. Take it, pull it out that the water might run freely and that that piece of wood doesn't begin to rot. How many people do you know who are stuck because of them and drifting in their lives? They're stuck in their in their spiritual life. They're stuck in their natural life. They're stuck with their walk with their walk with God. And you can see it written all over them. I wonder how many times do we just look at it and pass by? &gt;&gt; Do we just look at it and say, "Well, there's a piece of driftwood. There's another person struggling. We'll just we'll just let them drift on. We'll just we'll just keep them stuck because I don't want to get involved in anybody else's business." &gt;&gt; You know what's amazing? People will watch people will pull out their phones and they'll watch something terrible happen to somebody on the street. They'll they'll if they see a man abuse physically abusing a woman or physically abusing a little one of their children or whatever it may be or there's a fight on the street or who knows, put up your own story in your mind. Instead of people helping, instead of somebody reaching out and saying, "Hey guy, you probably shouldn't be hitting that woman, knock it off. Split up the fight." Instead, instead of getting involved and and and and taking care of it and helping somebody, people would rather pull out their phones and take a video. Have you ever been on an accident on the road and you think, "Oh my," or you've gotten a flat tire or something's happened and you think, "There'll be somebody for sure out of the six, seven million people here that's in the valley that's going to pull over and help me in this situation. Instead, they want to pull out their phones. Look at that person. They just got in a car wreck. Look it. Look it." They would rather take a video of somebody in need instead of helping the person in need. Why? Because the mentality is, well, it's none of my business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't getting involved in that. That that's that's their life. That's their deal. I'm talking spiritually also. &gt;&gt; I'm talking within the church. I'm talking within our families. That's none of my business. I'm just going to let that lie. and they can figure it all out themselves when really all they need is someone to put away their phone to stop videoing what's going bad and take action and help. My, it's amazing. You know, brother uh Matthew Aaron, his his coworker, uh his coworker just died there last week. And and if you need someone to pray for, we ought to pray for for this for that gentleman's wife. Here she is. She's eight months pregnant. And from my understanding, this this this this man, he he he was at a bar or whatever it was and bumped into a girl and you know, I'm sorry, didn't mean for that to happen. Excuse me. The night went on, he left wherever establishment it was. And three men followed him out and one of them sucker punched him in the back of the head. And when they hit him on the back of the head and his head hit the ground, his forehead, he was brain dead instantly. Saints of God, we don't know when our last moment of time is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen in our lives. And here's this guy and and and just from a worldly uh point of thinking, I suppose, because I've been there. I've been in those situations. I've been the one that got sucker punched and I've been the one that has sucker punched others. But and I and I and I put myself in this situation and I think how many how many people did that person have they have they punched before? &gt;&gt; You know, no doubt he took two friends with him. Big big tough guy. But no doubt has happened more than one time. And all of a sudden, it took one silly mistake, one silly punch, one silly uh uh moment of overreacting of something real real dumb. Let me just put it that way. And all of a sudden, that person becomes a murderer. Let me ask you something. Is it worth the overreaction? It's not worth it. Now he has he has ruined the life of that woman and and their unborn child that'll be born in the next three or four weeks. He's ruined his own life. They've ruined they killed somebody. What's the point? Let me ask you something. If you were to know what tomorrow holds, if you were to know your last your last your last minute and hour upon this earth, would you worry and stress so much about the little things in life? &gt;&gt; If you knew your moment was right now, if you knew your moment was in one hour's time, would you be worrying about the little the little petty issues within the church? Would you be worrying about the little petty issues within your own life and with your own family and and so on and so forth that No, you wouldn't. Chances are, here's what you would do. You would go and you would make the petty issues right. &gt;&gt; So, we ought to be living our lives. Amen. according to if this is the last minute that I'm on planet Earth. &gt;&gt; What would you do if this was your last minute? Who would you call to make things right? What would you do after the service this morning? &gt;&gt; Go do it. &gt;&gt; Because you know it's worth doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? But the longer we leave things, it fers and and and it becomes an issue and and and and and if you leave an infection unattended, it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we are our lives become infected because of the life that we're living. Our lives become infected because of the life that we're living in and the way we're treating our bodies. &gt;&gt; Our spiritual life becomes infected. And if we don't change something, &gt;&gt; if we don't change something within our lives, if we don't change something within our diet, it only gets worse. The infection gets worse. So it is spiritually. If we leave infections in our spiritual life unattended and we don't do something about it, it just fers and it gets worse. God help us to do what we know we need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I say this morning and I I'm talking to myself this morning even also because I'm going to make a call after service as well. &gt;&gt; It's so amazing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You begin to preach and and and you go down a little rabbit trail and all of a sudden there's there's n there's there's a name in my heart that I'm preaching to myself. &gt;&gt; That's how I know it's not the man, but it's God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know I know someone that I need to reach out to that I haven't spoken to in quite a long time. I got no hatred. I got no animosity, but I need to do it. You know, sometimes a simple I'm sorry, even when you know, and this is pride speaking, perhaps you know you're not even in the wrong. But it takes and you think, well, why should I apologize and make something right if I'm not the one in the wrong? You know what that's called? It's called pride. And pride is something that all of us need to swallow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ah, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so we realize that Nebuchadnezzar has this dream and and Daniel is the only one in the kingdom that's able to interpret this dream to him. And we realize that this was not just a dream, but this this dream that Nebuchadnezzar had. It was a prophecy. It was a it was it was a prophecy of a of a dispensation. It was a prophecy of a gentile dispensation. So, it wasn't just a dream that troubled him, but a dream interpreted. Brother Brandham said is prophecy. So here was Nebuchadnezzar and he has this dream and Daniel comes along and he and he and he and he gives the interpretation of this dream and we realized that that that this was a this was the beginning to the ending of the gentile dispensation. So, brother Brandham would take this take this portion of scripture and he would say right at this very time of Nebuchadnezzar and and and Daniel and this dream that he had of of the head of gold that went down to the legs of iron and and feet of iron and clay that that that this head of gold who was Nebuchadnezzar was the beginning of the gentile dispensation. So if you want to know the beginning of it, here it is. Because from the head of gold where it began to the to the to the legs and the feet of iron and clay to where it gets struck by the rock that was that was sheun out of the mountain but with no hands from the beginning to the ending. It was a dream of the of the gentile dispensation. And so we understand that even though it was the beginning to the ending of this dispensation, it is not where the dispensation of the bride began. It's where the Gentiles began of when God first left Israel and now he's he's beginning to do things through the Gentiles. And it's so amazing to me that when you look at this dream and and you look at the the head of gold and the and and and and the breastplate of of of silver and so on and so forth, it's amazing to me that that we could read that that very same passage of scripture and we would say, well, we could get a vision of it in our mind but have absolutely no understanding of what it means. That's why we need a a prophetic message. And I am so glad for that prophetic message in this day that that a prophet could look with prophetic insight and say, "Here's the beginning and here's the ending and here's the the the journey from the beginning to the ending." &gt;&gt; Me and you just look at it, we say, "My, that's quite a dream." Even though we would have the Holy Ghost, it still takes the inspiration of a prophet's message. &gt;&gt; What's interesting is this, the gentile dispensation, it begins at the top and it works its way to the bottom. Starts with the head of gold. It ends with the with the with the 10 toes. Eastern and Western countries. &gt;&gt; It it and the total destruction of it is when there's this this this this rock or this stone or whatever you want to call it that's that that wasn't made by hands. You see, this rock is Christ. It wasn't made by hands. It wasn't it wasn't made by human intellects, but it was it was tuned out and it was carved specifically by God himself. And the ending of this gentile dispensation is when that rock returns, that stone returns and it smites the image &gt;&gt; and it smites that image so hard that it breaks it into powder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But whenever God begins to talk begins to deal with the dispensation of the bride, he starts from the bottom and he works his way up. Why is it that this image that this image gets crushed? Its foundation is not good enough. Because the feet is a mixture of iron of clay and iron and clay does not mix together. Therefore, the foundation of it is weak. &gt;&gt; But when God begins with the dispensation of the bride, what does he begin to do? He starts at the bottom &gt;&gt; because the foundation is the most important part of the structure. &gt;&gt; If the foundation is wrong, the structure will be wrong. And uh the apostle Paul said, I I I'm a great master builder. I've laid a foundation. Watch there on how you build upon this foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in questions and answers. Brother Brandham um 19th chapter and the 18th verse yet have I kept 7,000 of Israel 7,000 in Israel all haven't bowed to Ba and every or bowed to Baal which was not which has not kissed him mouth who has not kissed him explain this for me the 700 it was 7,000 see kissing Baal how many here was formerly Catholic see you kiss images and remember in the time of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar when the gentile kingdom was issued in. See, when the gentile kingdom issued in, it come in by worship of a man. Nebuchadnezzar made a statue of a man. If you've got a spiritual mind, now listen to this revelation. That spirit that that that man that he had made a revelation of, he made an image of by his revelation was Daniel, a religious man being worshiped. See, because he named him Belchesar, which was the name of his god, and to and he made an image of that god, which was the image of Daniel. And Daniel refused to bow to his own image. See, and here it is again. Now, watch. The gentile kingdom was issued in in the days of Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar, a gentile king, putting his church and state together by taking an image of a holy man and forcing worship to it. The gentile kingdom ends in the feet with the handwriting on the wall by a political power that's united church and state together to force kissing images again you see the same thing image of a holy man. Now you might say, "Well, brother Stephen, are we is that talking about brother Brandham and is that talking about his ministry? How that people will worship the uh worship the man rather than the lamb?" You can you could put it there, but that's not what brother Brham is talking about because he says it was by a forcing &gt;&gt; by a forcing of kissing the image by a forcing of of of of taking of coming under this this uh worldwide religion. a forcing of bowing. I want to tell you something. I am not forced to believe this message. &gt;&gt; Nobody forces me. Nobody ties my hand behind my back. Nobody makes me come to church. Nobody makes me listen to the message. No, I'm not forced to do anything. But I am compelled by God. &gt;&gt; I am compelled by God through the love of God. That's why I follow this message. &gt;&gt; Nobody forces me. Nobody makes me do it. Nobody makes me live my life this way. No, I do it because I am surrounded and I am compelled by the very love of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't misinterpret my love for the Lord and my love for this message as worship for the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was the forcing. It was a uniting of church and of state. Nebuchadnezzar, he brought the church and the state together and he united it. And he was so caught up with the gift in and Daniel's life is this is the man and his God we're going to worship. And if you don't bow down to the statue of him, you're going to end up in the lion's den or you're going to end up in a in a burning furnace. You need to bow the knee. So, brother Brandham takes this story now of it's a let me say it like this a prefigure of what was to happen to the gentile church. &gt;&gt; He takes it now as a prefigure and he says as it began, it's going to end. &gt;&gt; It began with the forcing of the worship of a man and it's going to end with the forcing of the worship of the man with the handwriting on the wall. You see how important it is for you and I to be able to look at the handwriting on the wall and to be able to interpret what it means. &gt;&gt; It was a prefigure that what would be done at the council of Nia 325 AD when Constantine now would take the church in the state. &gt;&gt; What church age is that? &gt;&gt; Third church age. the marrying of church and state. He now brings it together. He marries them together. And by doing so, what did he do? This this this Roman kingdom, &gt;&gt; this pagan Roman kingdom of of it wasn't Babylon, but it was Rome that had a that that this beast was was wounded onto death. &gt;&gt; Rome had fallen. Rome had conquered all of the world. She was the legs of iron. But all of a sudden now this wound which which was wounded onto death by its fall now was re revived by Constantine by maraging of the church &gt;&gt; and of the state and this beast this spirit that went around and and killed and destroyed and took over took over the entire world almost. Yes sir. The spirit that was in that beast was now revived and it was no longer pagan Rome. But now it was called papel Rome. So no longer was it paganism as as you would call it. It was paganism disguised in Christianity. &gt;&gt; If I could put it like this. Satan changed his mask. That's right. &gt;&gt; We talk about God changing his mask and God and Morpha and God and Morpha over here and over there and now it's God and Morphe and us. But understand Satan does the same thing. So now Satan changes his mask in this third church age because in the first three church ages, remember he was a white horse rider. first church age. He he he went out and and he rode and he was conquering and uh sent out to conquer and no arrows. &gt;&gt; Want to do much with no arrows? &gt;&gt; What good is a bow with no arrows? It seems so seems so simple. It seems so innocent. But yet now that spirit would begin to uh get worse and worse and he would and he would begin to change his mask as time goes on. And as time goes on, sin it multiplies and it gets worse and it gets worse. So then all of a sudden he he this this spirit on this white horse rider, he ends up he's he's crowned with a triple crown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden he he's kingly. &gt;&gt; He's something that can be worshiped. &gt;&gt; And when he gets to that stage where he has where he has church and state in his hands, he can take over the whole world. He changes his form once again. &gt;&gt; He changes his horse. It's the It's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; The same spirit in Babylon was the same spirit with the Mes and Persians. The same spirit with the Grecians. The same spirit in Rome. Now it's in the church. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan is always wanting to intermingle with the seed of God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he did it in the garden. &gt;&gt; He mingled his seed in with the children of God. And then when God be to birth his church, now Satan, he couldn't let that happen. So what does he do now? He begins to mingle himself in with the church until we get to a point of Matthew 24:24 that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible. Why? Because it would be so close to the truth. Surely thou shalt not. &gt;&gt; So close to the truth, but yet be a complete lie. So, Satan begins to change his form. He changes his mask. But yet, it's the same Satan with the same power. And once he once he has in his hand church and state, now he says, "Now you're going to bow to me. And if you don't bow to me, I will make you bow." &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, Christianity takes a whole other form. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me ask you, if you were to look at the church of Ephesus, of the church of Pentecost, and then look at the the the the first church, the Catholic church where it was united and it was brought together under Constantine. If you were to look at the fruits of the two churches, which one is more like God? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; There's one. There's one that is long-suffering and one that loves, one that knows how to bring the right kind of offering, but then there's one all they want to do is to seek, destroy, and to kill. Who does that remind you of in the Garden of Eden? &gt;&gt; So all you have to do is look at the fruits of what the spirit is producing. &gt;&gt; Then you can understand what kind of spirit it is. Exposition of the seven church ages, Pergamian church age. Brother Brandham says, "People look at Rome. They look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation. And she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors. Papal false Christian Rome. She is even called the eternal city. How blasphemous. now controlled by religion even more aly than when pagan imperial Rome controlled by the pure force pure iron of force. Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and backed the union by force. The spirit that motivated pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome. So, the same spirit that was in pagan Rome is the same spirit, same uh pagan uh idolatrous spirit that's in paple Rome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How do you know? All you got to do is look at the fruits of what it produced. &gt;&gt; This is astounding. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. And it's not just a history. understand that. You know, I used to read my church aids book and and my seven seal book and I would think, well, this is pretty amazing and and I would think to myself, this is nothing but church history. You know, you know that God, and brother Brandham says this in the seventh seal, he says that God, whenever God was revealing, and I'm paraphrasing it because some of you are going to He didn't say it just like that. Brother Steven sent, paraphrasing it. Okay, I think it's paragraph 328, something in around here. I've been reading it. But brother Brandham says this. He says that God didn't give him that he didn't understand the reason of the blast and all those things that were happening. He said he was scared that he was going to die. And the day of and the day before that the seal was to be opened, that the seal was to be loosed and revealed, he didn't know what it was. He said, "God didn't give it all to me at once. He gave it to me as I had need of it." &gt;&gt; Understand? God does the same thing with you and I. We might not understand everything and we might not be able to explain everything of the message and all the doctrines and so on and so forth, but I'll say this, God will give it to you as you have need of it. &gt;&gt; So back here I'm thinking it's just it's a history of the church and this is a nice book, but as as as I had need of the revelation. Now God begins to deal with my heart and say, "This is a lot more than church history, but this is reading between the lines and recognizing the spirits that are driving the church." &gt;&gt; Because when you recognize the spirit by the fruit that it produces, when you recognize a nickelan spirit, you can say that person's nickel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Cuz he's trying to divide and conquer the leoty. They're trying to come between me and my family, my friends, whatever it may be. &gt;&gt; So when you read with a spiritual understanding, &gt;&gt; the whole thing lights up &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden our discernment awakens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told the church, the the the youth the other the other week, like we need to stop walking around with our head in the sand and use some discernment. use some discernment of the things that we see of spirits and and and and and and all the different things that affect us in our lives and and just and stop just using things as an excuse, but to have some spiritual understanding, to have some spiritual discernment and recognize these things and be able to say, "Ha, I know not to go down that way." &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because I recognize and I can discern where it's going to lead me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we are to use spiritual discernment and to and with choices and decisions that we are to make, our lives would be a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we just &gt;&gt; we're drifting, aren't we? Continuing on, you can see that this is so because now know that the fourth empire never went out of existence. He's talking about Rome. It just changed in its outer texture. Once the Nyine Council had swung the power of political Rome to the church, it seemed that there were no limits to which the first Christian church would go. The name Christian which originally brought uh brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors. &gt;&gt; That's correct. At one point they Saul he came after those who called themselves Christians and he persecuted them. But now all of a sudden the name Christian they became the persecutors. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this that bride cannot persecute bride. &gt;&gt; So therefore if we see someone out here they say they're a message believer and they're just persecuting everybody that's within the bride. We can look at the spirit and we can look at the fruits of the life and we can say not of the original Christian church. &gt;&gt; Spiritual discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can discern the fruit on the tree and then we can understand if we should partake of that tree or not. Amen. That's true, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It is. But if you can't discern the fruit, whether it's good or bad of the tree, you're going to partake of it. And once you partake of it, now that that fruit now becomes a part of what you are and you become a part of the fruit and then what happens, saints of God, let me tell you what happens. Our spirits get defiled. Father, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The name Christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors. It was in this age that Augustine of Hippo set forth the precept that the church ought and must use force to ne if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and if and that it was in harmony with the word of God to kill the heretics and apostates. So now when I look at this and I and I read this, I think to myself, the original Catholic Church, they if they had to, they would use fear in order to get a conversion. &gt;&gt; So now I think about it within my own mind and use some kind of discernment. And now I think to myself, wow, that's no way for a father to raise his children. If a father treats his children this way, he's treating his children according to the Roman Catholic Church. And the spirit behind that church is the spirit that was in pagan Rome. So therefore, if we're raising families according to fear, we're raising them according to paganism. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the pastor or the preacher is preaching a message due to fear, what what is the spirit that is driving behind that minister and behind that message? It is not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Spiritual discernment. Follow along with me. Um in his controversy with uh don donatists he wrote it is needed better that man should be led to worship God by teaching man that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but it does not follow that because the former course produces better I think I skipped something should be led no I didn't therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected for many have found advantage as we have proved and our daily proving by actual experience and being first compelled by fear or pain so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching so that they might follow out and act what they have already learned in word. Whilst those are better who are guided a right by love, those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear. They're even saying it themselves &gt;&gt; that being directed by love. And remember last Sunday, brother Bradom says that chastisement is not for punishment, but it's to bring out a better end. &gt;&gt; So it all depends on the spirit that's driving it. &gt;&gt; Because if it's by fear, we realize that it's actually a spirit, a pagan spirit. But if it's by if it's by love because we want to bring an expected end for the person because we love them and we want to guide them in the right way. There it's the spirit of God. Therefore it all depends on the spirit that's driving the person &gt;&gt; and a lot of times the person will not know nor understand nor discern the because we are blinded to ourselves. But it takes it takes the discernment of the people to watch and to understand the heart and the spirit that's driving the person. Does that make sense? So therefore, what that means is that is that us as the ley, we're not just supposed to sit around and just and just just be like a garbage can and open the lid and everything that goes in is is okay. We're supposed to use discernment. &gt;&gt; And you know what, saints of God, let me say this. That's why I go to this church. That's why I call brother Ron my pastor because I can see the spirit that has led the man throughout all these years. &gt;&gt; And it's a and I believe it to be the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; But we got to use spiritual discernment. He says here, "It's more numerous who are corrected by fear. For who can possibly love us more than Christ who laid down his life for the sheep?" Yet after calling Peter and the a and the other apostles by words alone, when he came to summon Paul, he not only constrained him by his voice, but even dashed him to the earth with his power, and that he might forcibly bring one who was raging amidst the darkness infidelity to desire the light of the heart. He first struck him of physical blindness to the eyes. Why therefore should not the church use force on compelling her lost sons to return? The Lord himself said, "Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in." Wherefore, if the power which the church has received by divine appointment in its due season through the religious character and faith of kings, be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges, that is in heresies and and schisms, are compelled to come in, let then let them not find fault with being compelled. It was at this moment of time around this time that this horse rider now changes from the white horse now to the red horse from the third church age to the fourth church age. But as he is changing his mask all of a sudden now God changes his mask. The Bible says that I'll raise up a standard as the enemy comes in like a flood. I will raise up a standard against that enemy. So now he changes from a lion to a burden, an a a beast of burden, which is an ox. Now we go through 1,200 years or whatever it is of dark ages. We have a a video here that I would like to play. If we could play that, brethren, please. And this is this is really interesting to me. This is just here last Wednesday. Look what these guys are doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look. &gt;&gt; Before you meet the Pope, you've got to bow and kiss his ring. These guys are so excited to meet the Pope. And you'll see they have a gift for him here in the background. A white horse &gt;&gt; and his name is Proton. He's got that wild stare, doesn't he? Sure does. &gt;&gt; I think God is trying to show us something here. &gt;&gt; This is an Arabian horse that was gifted to the Pope because he loves horses. Watch how happy he is here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; I thought this was a real interesting video. And you know the name Proton. Does anybody know what it means in the Greek? It means the first. So now here is this pope being gifted a white horse and his name is Proton which means the first. And so we understand by spiritual revelation and we've been alluding to it a little bit this morning of how that first horse rider he rode on a white horse. And so now here is this pope and he's been given this white horse and his name is the first and and it's a a resemblance if you ask me of of the first white horse rider that begin to ride. Now what we've been speaking about is that that the rider never changes. the white horse rider, the the red horse rider, the black horse rider, and the pale horse rider. It is all the same rider that is riding the horses. He just changes his horse. Now, and this is just pure speculation, and I'm just throwing this out there for you and I to think about these things, to think about the handwriting, which is on the wall because that's my sermon title. um and to understand the day and hour in which we're living in. Could it be that we have just as Christ we say he is alpha and he is omega, he has the omega bride now that is that is coming coming together with Christ once again. The alpha and omega now joining to be one. Are we at so close to the end time when this pale horse rider begins to ride that this is the last pope that we have now the first and the last now uniting together? Then we we know that when that pale horse rider begins to ride his name is death. He's the only horse that has a name and hell follows him. But I'm so thankful to God that when that pale horse rider begins to ride and and his name is death and hell follows him that the bride is already gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when he steps forth to claim those who he has redeemed already, the day the day of of of mercy and grace is done with, judgment is striking the earth and the bride who is a representation of the blood is taken up. So therefore, when that happens, Satan himself is incarnate in a man. He begins his ride on a pale horse and death and hell follow him. &gt;&gt; I wonder. It's pure speculation. &gt;&gt; Pure speculation, but it's worth a thought. &gt;&gt; What if? Brother Brandon would say, "What if?" He would say, "Sers, is this the time?" He would say, "These these souls that are in prison now, is this the time? &gt;&gt; Is this where we are? Has time ended?" He was speculating. He was asking the question, "Therefore, I believe that I have grounds to do the same thing to you." To think this handwriting is on the wall all around us. And what is the handwriting telling us? How close to the coming of the Lord are we? Man, I got a lot left. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this. Brother Brandham said he was supposed to meet the pope. You remember? &gt;&gt; But what is the thing that he would not do? &gt;&gt; He wouldn't bow and he wouldn't kiss his ring. He said, "I bow to one. That's Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; You see all these men up here bowing the knee, kissing his ring, and they're so happy about it. The Bible says that people will be deceived to believe a lie and to be damned by it. &gt;&gt; Thank God that he hasn't given us an eye to be deceived by a lie, but he's given us an eye and a heart to receive the truth. &gt;&gt; The Gentile dispensation began with the forcing of the worship of a holy man and it ends the same way. forcing of a holy man of kissing images and bowing before holy images. Wow. 2 Thessalonians 2 1-4 says, "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together uh unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition, who opposes and exaltth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he as God siteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. In Satan's Eden 1965, that deceitfulness of the church today, the son of predition, the devil, the son of predition, the devil, then people worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God. What do these men think they're doing? &gt;&gt; They think they're worshiping God because here's this holy man, the vicor of Christ. Here he is in the state of Christ. A holy man, this this Catholic church that has lasted for all of these years. &gt;&gt; Surely it must be right. Nonsense. He says they think they're worshiping God, but they're worshiping Satan. They're worshiping him through a creed, a man-made denominations and creeds has brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known of. No matter how much of the word promised for this day is preached and vindicated, they still won't believe it. &gt;&gt; They still won't believe it. Why is that? Why why won't they believe it? Because some people just can't believe it. Okay, let me keep let me try to stay focused here. Oh yeah. Okay. Um Daniel 5:es 3-6. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines drank in them. They drank verse four wine and praised the gods of gold, of silver, brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. And in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled them so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smoked one against the other. Understand these vessels that we're talking about here, they were taken from the house of the Lord, from the temple of the Lord um that was dedicated by Solomon. And when Solomon dedicated this temple, and we all know the story that the glory of God filled the temple, but the glory of God did not fill the temple until the priests brought these vessels, these cups of of gold and stuff. When the priests brought these vessels of gold and silver and so forth into the temple, it was the it was the last it was the last thing to take his position within the temple before God filled the temple with his presence. And so, what are you and I? You and I are vessels of the Lord. We are vessels that are made onto honor. So now these vessels, they were made onto honor were now put in the wrong hands and they were used for the wrong thing. And so we know that by predestination that we were always vessels of gold. We were always vessels of honor because that's how God made us. But when we were born through our parents through through an act of sin and conception, understand that these vessels of gold that you and I are was placed into the wrong hands of Satan. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now whenever these whenever these vessels they they took these vessels and they and they begin to drink from them. I read a commentary and it said that whenever a whenever a a a kingdom was was um defeated that the the the conquerors would take the vessels of the gold and the certain things out of the temple of their gods and they would take it into their own temples. And what they would do is they it would be a a a a prideful show of act of of that they were the conquerors and that this God was conquered. Now we can and and that that's also in the scripture of where remember the Philistines took the ark of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where did they put the ark of the Lord? They put it in with Deeon their God. &gt;&gt; And what happened to Deeon their God? Came in one day. was laying face over and there was an arm cracked off and you all know the story and all of a sudden they realized who's God was real &gt;&gt; whose God was really God and it was at this time whenever they began to show mockery towards God and drinking from the the sanctified vessels that were ordained of God for a purpose to serve within the temple. God had had enough. God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; He'll not be knock mocked by us and he'll not be mocked by Satan. &gt;&gt; So all of a sudden he says, "I've had enough of this." And the fingers now the handwriting now begins to draw upon the walls. understand in your life a vessel of honor unto God. A vessel that has been prepared for God for the service of God in this hour in which we're living in when God had enough of the mockery of you being in the wrong hands of Satan. All of a sudden, he sent your way the supernatural in order to bring you out of the wrong kind of hands and to to use you for his glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of a sudden the supernatural was upon the people or was around the people and they didn't understand it. What means this this I see a hand and I see this writing in an unknown tongue. I I don't understand. There was handwriting on the wall and there was nobody there that understood the handwriting or no one there that was able to interpret the handwriting that was upon the wall. But there was one man there by the name of Daniel who was able to interpret the handwriting and was able to show to the king the future events in his life. Little did he know it would be that night that his life would be taken. Now brother Brandham says uh just once more Lord he's talking about Sam Samson an outstanding servant of God. Now he stands there humiliated blind weakened a disgraced. It's a picture of a demoralized sunken generation. It's a picture of a nation that's lost its hold with God. It's a picture of a church that's lost its hold on God's word because that's what Samuel what Samson represented here. Humiliated, broken. It kind of reminds us of this United States of America that we're living in right now, doesn't it? Humiliated, broken. He was in a terrible condition as he sat there or stood there rather. He so could you imagine him standing this great man that one time he could what he could do and here he is standing here in that condition humiliated as I said broken a symbol that I want to declare tonight this symbol represents the very hour that we're now living the condition of the church now broken out of the word of the Lord humiliated out of its place and the question is coming today the handwriting is on the wall and who can read it they know nothing about it &gt;&gt; amen They under they saw the handwriting on the wall. It was the supernatural God that was beginning to reveal himself supernaturally, but there was no one there that understood what it said because they didn't understand uh spiritual things. They were all they were so caught up with partying. They were so caught up with the drinking and the women and the concubines and and and having a a big day and a big life to where when the supernatural was presented to them. When the when the handwriting was was upon the wall and it was presented to them, they were so caught up with worldly affairs that they didn't understand supernatural or spiritual things. And brother Brandon would would take that now and he would type it to the day in which he was living in. and he would actually type it to the days of of Elvis Presley because Elvis Presley all of a sudden came to fame in 1957, whatever it was, and and he began to sing these songs and America began to go wild with rock and roll and and partying and creating records and so on and so forth to where they forgot their god-given rights. They they forgot who they were and they now were beginning to be used as vessels of dishonor. And brother Brandham uses this very statement. He says, he says, Belshazar was all shook up &gt;&gt; because his joints and his legs and his knees were loosed &gt;&gt; and he began his knees began to quake. &gt;&gt; He was all shook up. &gt;&gt; This is astounding. Have any of you ever saw Elvis Presley and how he dances? and how he would swing his hips and how he would move his knees. If you haven't, that's good. You don't need to go look it up. But brother Brandham is is typing now. Remember remember the handwriting is on the wall as the Gentile dispensation started. It's going out not just with the worship of a man, but now he's tying together where Elvis Presley being all shook up and he's he's he's paralleling that to Belshazar. &gt;&gt; And so we try to tell ourselves it doesn't matter what kind of music we're listening to. I beg to differ. &gt;&gt; See, it's a Christian song sang by Elvis Presley. What kind of spirit is behind it? &gt;&gt; Sometimes, saints of God, we need to be careful of what we're listening to. &gt;&gt; And the spirit that's behind the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because then all of a sudden, you know, you know what church becomes? Church, it becomes uh contemporary worship. We don't want contemporary worship. We want worship. &gt;&gt; We don't want rock and roll Christian music. No, we want we want hymns and and and stuff that's pleasing to God and things that have been wrote written by people that have had a testimony. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Music is a I don't know much about music. I'm not a musician and I'm not a singer. Neither am I a song leader. But I am spiritual enough to understand that certain songs shouldn't be played in our cars, shouldn't be played in our homes, and we shouldn't sing them in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we do or not. Just saying. Okay. &gt;&gt; That's something for you all to think about. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me keep going. I know I'm going long. I'm sorry. The wise man didn't astrologers astrologers couldn't explain it. the handwriting that was on the wall. The women that was present, they had no idea of what it meant. You see, the the the wise things of God are understood by wise men of God. And spiritual things are given to spiritual people who will understand the spiritual and the supernatural. Okay? Brother Brandham's life, just stay with me for a little bit. Brother Brandham's life was a a supernatural life. And this this life, you know what it was? Brother Brandham's life was God's handwriting all over the walls of Leodysia because the supernatural is to do two things. Number one is to catch the attention of the people and number two is to show us that impending judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; It's the whole way through the scripture that God always sends the supernatural to save one and to condemn the other. And so now when we begin to see this this supernatural life of of of brother Brandham, this seventh church age messenger, what is it showing us? It is showing us that that God is on the scene and it is showing us that the handwriting is on the wall and that impending judgment is near. That's what the handwriting is saying to Leodysia. But who can read it &gt;&gt; and who can understand it? We've had 1,200 sermons of God's handwriting &gt;&gt; all over the walls of Leodysia giving a warning before judgment. And it all comes down to this very point that we are at the ending of this gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; What are all these things showing? What what does it mean? What is the handwriting on the wall? What are these 1,200 sermons? What do they mean? It means that that that this world has been found in the balances has been weighed and found wanting. &gt;&gt; It's been weighed in the balance of God's word and it's been found too light. It's been found too heavy. It's not a perfect balance. &gt;&gt; So therefore, he sends the supernatural in order to get our attention that God is going to do something. And when he sends the supernatural, it is a sign of impending judgment. Their handwriting is all over the wall. We could spend we could spend the rest of the day talking about the scriptures that have been fulfilled in this day of Revelations 10:7, Malachi 4:56 in the book of Zechariah. Behold, it'll be light at the evening time. And we could go on and on and on and we could go through the scriptures and we could go through the types and the shadows of of the bride and the bridegroom and this and that and and you begin to realize how much scripture is being has been fulfilled in this day in which we are living in. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; It's handwriting. It's on the wall. But not everybody can interpret the handwriting. only a select few who have been taught by a prophetic message to realize that this handwriting means we have been been weighed in the balances &gt;&gt; and this world is found wanting &gt;&gt; handwriting on the wall and so have you got an example of what God did uh he's talking about Daniel talking to Belshazar before him there um and you so have you got an example example of what God did to those who didn't walk upright before him. These are not mysterious things. This is not a hard message. It's the truth. You've got an example. You know what he did back yonder to the women who danced before the idols. You know what he did to the men who went after strange women. You know what he did to the drunken s and the homosexuals and the perverts of Sodom. It's it's no strange thing. You know these things. You should have known it. That's your example by your grandfather. But now this is the meaning of the writing. God has numbered your kingdom. You are weighed in the balance and found wanting. Oh, if there was ever a time that Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Luther, Pentecostals, they are weighed in the balance, God's balance, and found wanting. They've called the spirit of the living God an unholy thing. And they've done despite to the works of grace, they have followed big churches and organizations. You assemblies of God, you church of God, all you witness, trinitarians, Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, you know you've gone back to Babylon. &gt;&gt; You had the example of that. And this random tabernacle knows that you've been warned of those things years ago, but now you're weighed in the balances and found wanting, &gt;&gt; fussing, &gt;&gt; fighting, holding grudges &gt;&gt; and stewing. &gt;&gt; And you think God could work in a place like that? &gt;&gt; There you are. I love how brother Brandham brings it into the Brandham Tabernacle &gt;&gt; because he's not just pointing fingers out here that everybody else has found has been weighed and found wanting, but now he brings it personally to the Brandham Tabernacle. And so then I take it to myself and I say, "Okay, can I take this to me? And how is my weight in and in in God's balance? Am I balanced or have I been found wanting?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fussing, stewing, &gt;&gt; fighting, &gt;&gt; envy, He says, he says, "You think God could work in a place like that? Never. There you are." &gt;&gt; What a powerful thought. &gt;&gt; As a musician's come, we'll bring this to a close. I wonder if God was to weigh you and I this morning in his bal in his in his balances. I wonder how we would be found. Brother Brandham talks about Pearl Harbor and there's about 11 quotes in Pearl Harbor and uh he talks about Pearl Harbor and what had happened and how that it was such a catastrophe and such a such a a bad thing that had happened and and and how that he says they were caught off guard. And he then goes on to say that he had read an article and and we all understand the story of Pearl Harbor, but he had read an article and and he found out that the people of Pearl Harbor were not necessarily found uh they were found wanting. &gt;&gt; They knew of the impending judgment. &gt;&gt; They knew that the Japs were going to attack. They knew that uh they had word that the Japanese fleet was forming in the in the sea there and and they were getting troops together and that they were they were forming a formation and there was planes coming and they were they were getting their stuff all together because they've been planning this attack on Pearl Harbor. And brother Brandham says he he says follow along with me. And he talks about it and he says you know they knew of the impending disaster that was coming. They knew of an attack that was being planned but yet they failed to plan to defend themselves. He says because they were all so caught up with the boogie woogie music. They were so caught up with the dancing and the partying. in and he goes on and he dramatizes it and he says, "Did you hear of the rumor that the Japanese are planning to attack us and they were at a bar and there was a girl that sat up on the bar and she said, "Oh, don't you know that we've come here for a good time, not to talk about war." And all of a sudden, their their minds were sidetracked. from the generals down to the floor sweepers. All they had in their mind was a great big party was worldly things and worldly affairs and concubines and dancing and so on and so forth. And they would say, "Well, it's just a rumor. It's just a rumor. It's not going to happen. Let's have a good time because we're here for a good time, not for a long time." And we know that because they they failed to prepare themselves for the oncoming judgment. Though the handwriting was on the wall, though they were able to interpret the handwriting, but yet they classed it as a rumor, they were able to read it and say, "The Japanese are forming. They've got their fleets out there. They've got bombers. They've got so forth and so on. They're preparing to attack us." But yet instead of getting ready, though they heard the message, &gt;&gt; though they understood the message, yet they got sidetracked and they failed to purpose in their heart to do what they were sent to do. And we all know the story and how it ends and how the rumors were true. The rumors were true. The Japanese were forming. They were getting their planes. They were getting uh the things that they needed to attack Pearl Harbor. And it ended up being a true story. And when you go to Pearl Harbor and and you go and you see the ship that is sunken there and and you think to yourself, my my my my could have been prevented if only they would have been at their right place in their right position doing what they were what they were what they were trained to do. What about you and I, my brother, my sister? We've heard the coming of the Lord draws nigh. We've seen the handwriting on the wall. We've seen the supernatural. We've recognized the supernatural. But just because many years have passed, that doesn't mean that the Lord has put off his coming. &gt;&gt; Cuz understand this, the rumor is true. &gt;&gt; The handwriting is on the wall. It's all around the walls of Leodysia. But I just wondered this morning, are we like those at Pearl Harbor? And though we've heard these things for many years and and we've been preparing for many years, I wonder are we just getting a little bit lax in our preparation for the coming of the Lord? Such a sombering thought &gt;&gt; and it's something that only you can answer and it's something that only I can answer for myself also. I know this I can do much better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here this morning that you would say, you know what, I can do much better, brother Stephen. And you would like to stand with me and you would like to say, yeah, I've heard it. I see the handwriting on the wall. I understand it. I'm able to interpret it, but I know that I can do better, Lord. I know that I can do better in my servantthood. I know that I can prepare just a little bit more, Lord. And so, Father, as we pray together, how about you lift your hands and you pray to God. And as I'm praying, I want you to pray. And I want you to pray from your heart as I pray from my heart. Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we present ourselves before you, Lord. And Father God, I want to I want to say that I'm sorry, Lord, because I know that I'm capable of so much more, Father. I know, Lord, that I'm capable of of getting of getting ready and preparations, Lord, because we've seen the handwriting on the wall, Father. We know that the rumors are true. Father, we know that you're coming, Lord, as a thief in the night. And so, Father, I'm asking you this morning that you would give us the grace, the grit, the determination, Lord, the discipline to do what we need to do, Father, to do what we know we should be doing, Lord. Father God, not not pointing at the at the driftwood that's in the water, but helping get that driftwood out of the water, Father. And Lord, if we are that piece of driftwood, I pray that's just drifting down La Leo to see it. Lord, I ask that you would come by and that you would pick us up, Lord, and bring us out of this this water that has us that has us stalled on the river banks, Father God. Father God, I I commit this sermon to you. And though it was perhaps a little a little cut up, Lord, and but Lord, I I I felt like you I know you placed it on my heart. I know the time and the place where I was and what I was doing when you placed it on my heart, Lord. Therefore, I know that this sermon was for somebody. Lord, help us to prepare and to get ready, Lord. For we've seen the handwriting on the wall. We've seen Revelations 10 1-7. We know the book has been opened, Lord, and we believe it with all our hearts. Now, Father, may we be watching and waiting for thy soon coming, for we know it comes as a thief in the night. Give us strength, we pray. Help us, Lord. Help us to follow through with those things that you're dealing with in our hearts, even at this very moment. Father God, I love you and commit this this people into your hands, Lord. Use everyone for thy kingdom's glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask these favors. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
