Huh? Listen, once you've seen the truth, &gt;&gt; then everything else &gt;&gt; is on the background. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Brother Steven McNeely is going to be ministering tonight, but we have a visitor here among us. Some of you uh may not have met him before, but our brother George Smith. Brother George, come on up here, my friend. Uh he just was down in Tucson and had his 80th birthday. He's looking pretty good. Yeah, look at him, Manny. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be here. And um I didn't come to speak. I would have tried to wear a tie if I was, but um yeah, I was out in Arizona here these last few days. And you know, this year August has five Sundays, so I've had five birthday cakes this year. I came all the way from North Carolina out here to see you all. &gt;&gt; But you know, these songs that we sing are real. &gt;&gt; We're not just going through the motions. &gt;&gt; If you're going through the motions, you might want to go to the other church cuz it's going to get tough here. &gt;&gt; Uh, a long time ago in 1964, Brother Brandham said, "If things go on the way they are now," I don't know what he was focused on, but something. He said in 50 years it'll be total insanity. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; 2014 closed the circle. So we've been 11 years in total insanity. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And you better be sure you know what you believe. &gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of stuff going around. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon brought us back to the open book. &gt;&gt; We preach from his absolute &gt;&gt; and God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the Bible, Paul had a lot of problems in his time. All this was just starting out. But God inspired him, gave him the true revelation, and that was the benchmark for all the church ages. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody read the church age book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We have a few more if you don't have one. But he said, "If I come back next week or Silas or Ron Peterson or George Smith or William Brandon and says anything different what I've already given you, it's going to the hot place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just watch out &gt;&gt; because there's a lot of foolishness going around in the name of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Not just here in America, but everywhere. That's true. &gt;&gt; But I will come back soon because it's been five years since I was here. &gt;&gt; A lot of you don't know who I am. But uh I promise to come back and um uh be with brother Ron and we'll bring something substantial. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a pleasure to have brother George here. He was saying, "Brother Ron, um, one of the older sermons that Brother Brennan preached on, uh, the great harlot, uh, it was a condensed sermon and one of the ones that was put on the vinyl records in which, uh, brother George gave me a stack of those years ago. And over the years now, I've given them out to ministers from around the world, and I think I might have one or two at home left over." But long story short, he he said, "I listened to it and it was so good that he's just recently uh translated it and printed it into Spanish." So he said before he leaves uh this evening, he'll give us a few copies so our Spanish-sp speakaking people uh believers here uh make sure that you get a a fresh copy of that. I'm sure you will enjoy it. Amen. Let's uh just continue on another song or two. Uh God bless you, Brother Austin. Amen. Let's all stand as we change the order of service. Sing your great name. Oh, the lost are saved and find their way at the sound [Music] of your great name. and all condemn feel no shame at the sound of your great name. In every fear, it has no place. At the sound of your great name, the enmy. Oh, he has to leave [Music] at the sound of your great name, Jesus. For worthy is the lamb that was slain. He's the son of God and man. You are highly lifted up and all the world will praise your great name. [Music] And all the we'll find their strength. Do you believe that tonight at the sound of your rain? Amen. Who's hungry? hungry soul and you will receive grace at the sound of your great name. In the father they will find their rest. Oh at the for your great name. Oh the sick are healed [Music] and the dead are raised at the sound. for your great name Jesus. Oh, worthy is the lamb that was slain for us. You're the son of God and you are high. Lift it up and all the world will praise your great name. [Music] Oh, he's redeemer. Oh my healer, Lord Almighty. My savior. Oh defender, you are my king, redeemer, my healer, Lord, all my savior, defender. You are my king. [Music] Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was slain. Slain for us. You're the son of God and man. You are high and lifted up and all the world will praise your great name. [Music] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to thee this evening &gt;&gt; with thanksgiving and worship in our hearts, &gt;&gt; Father, because of the wonderful things that you've done for us and the wonderful things that you're going to do for us. Lord, we say worthy is the lamb &gt;&gt; that was slain before the foundations of the world to take away hallelujah the sins my sins Lord the sins of your chosen people father we thank you this evening we commit this service into your hands Lord we ask that you would remember each and every need that's been presented here Lord from this pulpit and the unspoken requests that's upon the hearts Lord We give it all to thee for thou alone art able to meet all of our needs. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we commit all things to thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Isn't the Lord good? &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. God bless you. God bless you, brother Austin. Such a wonderful atmosphere and we certainly appreciate uh the gift making way for itself with our brother Austin. Huh. We greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. It's good to be gathered together. If you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Colossians, chapter 3, and we'll read verses 12- 15. Hallelujah. Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 says, "Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercy." So now he's he's not talking to the world. He's not he he's not talking to uh if you want to say foolish virgin or anything like that. No, he's talking to the elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So now the elect when you hear your name, you ought to listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. because he's going to tell you something right now. &gt;&gt; He's going to tell you, "Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another. &gt;&gt; If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye." &gt;&gt; Amen. And above all these things, put on charity, which is the bound of perfectness, the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you're called in one body, and be ye thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated this evening. I would like to title my sermon this evening an attitude of gratitude. &gt;&gt; An attitude of gratitude. So we see in our opening scripture that the Bible that God has certain expectations for us um that he expects us in or how to live our lives and how to conduct ourselves and so on and so forth. And um we see here that that the things that we that we just read as a as a carnal man um we are unable to do those things as a as a as a man in in humanity and raised in in in this in this end time that we're living in. We realize that forgiving one another and having a quarrel against this person and and and longsuffering and kindness and meekness, it's it it's kind of uh the opposite to how we are as human beings. But God puts it in his word because he's not just talking to humanity, but he's talking to the elect of God. And so if he's talking to the elect of God, we understand that it would take a a supernatural life, a supernatural experience from a supernatural God in order to produce this life that the Bible expects us to produce. &gt;&gt; Without a born again experience with God, without a change of heart and a change of mind, without a change of direction in our lives, uh uh guess what? um it it's going to be impossible for us to fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; So, we can say, "Well, I've been raised in church and I go to church and and and so on and so forth, but without a real change of heart and trying to be in a message church and trying to live the letter of the law, you're not going to be happy." &gt;&gt; Trying to live the letter of the law without a a love experience with Jesus Christ, guess what? You're never going to be happy in church. You're never going to be happy at home. Why? Because it's law. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to live our lives according to the law. One person reads the same scripture, he sees law. Another one reads the same scripture, they see love. &gt;&gt; And so it all depends what's in the heart of the person is what they're going to see. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says we don't see with our natural eyes, but we see from our heart. We understand from our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so if our heart is in the wrong kind of condition, &gt;&gt; if our heart is not softened by the presence of God and our heart has been become hardened because of this this this age that we're living in, guess what? That's all we're going to see through our carnal eyes. &gt;&gt; If our hearts are hardened, our spirit is going to be hardened. If our spirit is hardened, our mind is going to be hardened. If our mind is hardened, our eyes are going to be hardened. And all we're going to see is the negativity in this world. I don't want to see the negativity. I want to see the positivity. &gt;&gt; We can look at the world and we can say this world is is is is a fulfillment of the book of Timothy where it says that people will be heady and high-minded and and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. And we could look at it and see it and we can dwell upon those things. But we could also look at the scripture and say this day the bride is coming into her full position and with her position she is given authority with the word of God. So we can look at the negativity in the world but we could also look at what we are fulfilling in this day and in in this hour as the elected of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody's got to fulfill this. But somebody's got to fulfill this. &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about a rapture. Somebody's got to fulfill the prophecy of a changing of body, of not seeing, of death. And &gt;&gt; and caught up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why it's so important for us to be caught up right now, &gt;&gt; to be caught up in the message, to be caught up with a a relationship with Jesus Christ. Now is not the time for us to get lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Now is not the time for us to be wandering about in the wilderness, but now is the time for us to to be standing upon a a a sure foundation, a solid rock. Hey. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we see that people are uh getting away from this solid rock. &gt;&gt; You ever you ever uh you ever walk through through um uh a nice a nice a nice area of grass? We don't really have it here. In Ireland, we do. Some of you probably grass. What is grass in Ireland? You know, it rains every day. It's beautiful. It's green. It's fantastic. Except when brother Jonathan goes there. It hardly rained at all. So if y'all want to go when it doesn't rain, go with brother Jonathan to Ireland. But you ever walk through a a a a patch of grass and and and it looks lovely and it looks nice and then all of a sudden it and all of a sudden your feet is soaking wet and you're realizing, hey, grass isn't always greener on the other side here. Everybody, it seems like people are starting to to to get away from the solid rock and a solid foundation because it's almost too simple. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's almost, if I may say it like this, too boring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; It's it's it's boring. And so people are beginning to look around and they're saying, "Well, well, going to church is it's it's it's kind of boring. And so we need a great moving of the spirit and and we need to do this and we need to do that and we need to go over here. We don't need to do anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just need to stay founded on the solid rock &gt;&gt; because when we go looking at other things and and and and start seeking after other things is when we begin to step off the solid rock foundation of Jesus Christ. And when we do, that's when we get in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's when we get our feet wet. That's when we get bogged down in sin and the marry clay of life. Why? Because we're making choices that's taking us off the firm foundation. &gt;&gt; I want my feet firm. &gt;&gt; I want to be on a rock &gt;&gt; and I want to stand still and know that he is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; we're living in a time where the scripture is being fulfilled and and we and we recognize what a what an hour that we are living in as the bride of Jesus Christ of what God has actually done in this end time through these last 50, 60 years or or more. when brother Brandon was on the scene and and and and and all of a sudden, man, Christianity came to life, didn't it? &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, people begin to realize uh I was told from a from a an older brother one time and he said, you know, um he was told this, so this goes way back. He was told, he said, you know, we we didn't even know or believe that God answered prayer still until William Brandham came on the scene. &gt;&gt; And so what was so great about Brother Brandham was his simplicity in faith. And that's what I'm I'm I'm going to get into with an attitude of gratitude is that we're we're going to find out that um having thankfulness and having a heart of gratitude and not only uh uh thinking it in your heart and in your mind, but actually being thankful and saying it and telling people you're thankful and telling God you're thankful in the good times and the bad times actually affects our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the Bible talks about being unthankful, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; An unthankful person is a miserable person. &gt;&gt; You could give them whatever they wanted. If they're unthankful and ungrateful, hey, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we're living in a time where it takes a supernatural experience to live out the supernatural life of God himself. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls it, he says it is a supernatural word birth. We are birthed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; We are not birthed by the word of a man. &gt;&gt; We are not birthed by some special sermon that that was preached and perhaps the sermon was helpful to your life. But really what it is in your life and my life, it is the word of God that brings the change. It is the word of God that brings the difference. &gt;&gt; First Peter 1 23 it says, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever." &gt;&gt; It is through this new birth. And I'm sorry I didn't give the brothers the scriptures, but uh that's that's my fault. It is through this new birth by the word of God that we as the bride of Jesus Christ, as the elect of Jesus Christ, will be without spot or without wrinkle. That there be a bride who is making herself ready. How is she doing it? By the word of God. She's not doing it by legalism. She's not doing it by the law of the letter. But she's doing it by the the spirit. The revelation that the spirit is giving to her, that's what she's making herself ready by through the word of God. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And so as God gives us light, we walk in the light. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, God has we're all at different stages of our journey and some have a greater light than others. But as long as you're walking in the light as what God has given to you, if you continue in the light, God will continue to reveal himself because God is light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And by the light of the hour and the word of God that has been revealed to us today, it has brought a life upon the believer that has never been uh uh since the church ages ever began. Because now it is a greater light. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In Pentecost they were never completely as brother say born again. &gt;&gt; The bornag again experience is a process &gt;&gt; and it is a process that was kept for this end time &gt;&gt; for you and for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the light in this hour is greater than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; So now as we're walking in the light, guess what? Where where um what does the Bible say? Where much is given, much is required. &gt;&gt; Where much light is given. &gt;&gt; Much light is required to shine back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this bride of Jesus Christ, she's making herself ready and she is a people that is walking in humility in the light for this day and it makes us become the word being made flesh amongst many peoples. Hallelujah. You know what's amazing? Whenever we talk about the word being made flesh, uh I believe that we have we have gotten to mis misconceptions of what it actually means for a person to be the word made flesh. The elected the word for this day being made flesh. Would it be as simple as kindness and as longsuffering and as gentleness and the different things that we read? Would would that be too simple for you this evening to say that that is a part of the word being made flesh in the believer's life? A lot of times we get so caught up with the miraculous and we love the miraculous and we want to see the miraculous because we believe in the miraculous. But I believe we leave off the the the simple ways of life when we're always looking for something great when God is revealing himself in simplicity amongst the people. And so much of the time because we're not uh it doesn't happen how we expect it to happen, we miss it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so so much of the time, maybe I can speak for myself, but you're all humans, so I can speak for you, too. Okay? So much of the time we we look to ourselves and and we look at the negativity in our own lives and we say, "Well, if I was a son of God, I would that yeah, I wouldn't have said that or I wouldn't have done that." And if and if and if and we bombard our own minds with if I was. instead of having an attitude of gratitude and saying, "Father, thank you for who I am as a son or a daughter of God." &gt;&gt; And so, so much of the time we get caught up looking at our our own carnality. &gt;&gt; But understand, you didn't choose you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you didn't choose you. God chose you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so it's very interesting when you begin to think about God's choosing over man's choosing. &gt;&gt; So if we if it was up to us, we wouldn't choose any of us &gt;&gt; to be sons or daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're so good at seeing our own hindered parts and each other's hindered parts. &gt;&gt; We're very, very good at that. It's hard for us sometimes to see the good in our own life, what God is doing. And so we get so caught up with with the tangle and the and the and the fight and the pressure of our natural man and our spiritual man. &gt;&gt; It all depends on which one you're looking at more. &gt;&gt; And so when you think about the choosing of God, I was thinking about King David. And here King David was and and God had told Samuel, he said, "Go to the house of Jesse. He there's a there's a a man there after he's a man after my own heart. I want you to go anoint him forth oil with oil. He's going to be my future king. He's the one that I'm choosing. The people chose Saul. &gt;&gt; But God had a choosing and it was David. So Samuel, well, praise the Lord. Let's go. And he goes and he goes to the house of Jesse. And sure enough, the oldest one steps up and and and and perhaps he's the biggest and the strongest. He's the firstborn boy, you know, and here he is. And uh, no, it's not him. Well, where's the next one? Come on. And oh, it's not him. And they had go on down the line and and God speaks to Samuel. And he says, God, he says, I don't look on the outward appearance of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I look upon the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, what's what what really is interesting to me is this. &gt;&gt; Jesse didn't tell Samuel, I have another boy in the field. That's right. &gt;&gt; Samuel's all. &gt;&gt; You got anyone else? &gt;&gt; Like, is there Do you have any more sons? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz I I've come to anoint your son. He He He's going to be the future king. And do you have any other? He says, "Well, yeah. I got a kid out in the field here hurting the sheep, taking care of my sheep. Go bring him here." It's it's it's amazing to me that he never thought of David. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God thought of David. &gt;&gt; And so that's the wrestle that you and I have of have a we got sons of Jesse and we got all this uh within our within our lives as carnal men and we're looking to the outward man. We're looking to the flesh man of his mistakes and all these different things instead of looking to the inward man, the seed of David. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He's out here. There's no way. Can you imagine his brothers? &gt;&gt; David, little They're going to anoint him. There ain't no way. Sure enough, he comes and he anoints him with oil. And can you imagine, you know, and and every time David presented himself when he came to fight Goliath or whatever, and he was taking the the bread and the wine and and and stuff and and and he says, "I'll go fight this guy. They laughed at him. &gt;&gt; You're a naughty boy. &gt;&gt; You just come to see the battle. &gt;&gt; You're naughty. You're You're silly. &gt;&gt; But God had chosen David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The army didn't choose David. &gt;&gt; Saul didn't choose David. His daddy didn't choose David. Nobody chose David. Why? Because when God chooses, you normally it's against how we see and how our choosing would be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You could look at uh uh Saul of Tarsus here. Judas hung himself and they were like, "Well, we need we need another we need another disciple." &gt;&gt; So, they all get together. Well, we're spiritual men and we can make the right choice. And and they cast lots. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, I believe it was Matias, wasn't it? and he comes along and they and they vote him in and and and and and everything and yeah, we are spiritual men. We are the men of the hour. And brother Brandham says he didn't do anything. &gt;&gt; Not a thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he was the wrong choice. &gt;&gt; But the right choice was a brother Brandham says a hook-nosed hightempered Jew. Y &gt;&gt; you're going to take a hooknosed hightempered Jew who's persecuting the church and you're going to use him to be the first church age messenger. &gt;&gt; You got to be kidding me. But God's choosing goes far beyond our choosing. &gt;&gt; God chose his seventh day messenger uh uh without education. He came from a family of of drunkards and bootleggers and fighters and killers. But yet when everybody looked at the family, they crossed the street when they saw him. But when God saw him &gt;&gt; before the foundations of the world, he says, "That's him. &gt;&gt; He's the one. He's my messenger. I don't care what other people see. It's going to blind them. And I'm going to open the eyes to the elected." I say, "Father, blind our eyes to our choosing and open our spiritual eyes." Hallelujah. to who we really are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; Because when we realize, &gt;&gt; who we are, &gt;&gt; not according to this earthly tabernacle, but according to our spiritual tabernacle, we realize who we are in the mind of God since the foundations of the world, it'll change our attitudes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you got to know your identity &gt;&gt; and you can only find your identity in Christ. &gt;&gt; Even though Eve was a part of Adam and and and but she never knew it and she was taken out of Adam and and and and God separated them and and and and everything and here she was. She had no idea who she was. &gt;&gt; But who did she come to? the male. She came to Adam. She came to the word &gt;&gt; and he said, "Your name, you're gonna you're woman. Why are you woman?" Because you came out of the man. &gt;&gt; Where did the woman go for her identity? She went to the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's where we receive our identity &gt;&gt; is in the word of God. So don't get off the solid rock and try to find it anywhere else, but find it in the word. &gt;&gt; Thank God &gt;&gt; for predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his election &gt;&gt; towards his elected bride. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Stephen, well that kind of doesn't sound fair." and and you might be right, but the Bible says this, "My sheep, &gt;&gt; they hear my voice and another they will not follow." &gt;&gt; So, we see that there's a a sheep there is a people that will receive his voice, but there's a people that will receive other voices that aren't part of his voice. I said, "Lord, just let me hear your voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Philippians 4 verse 6, be careful for nothing. In other words, don't worry. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; let your requests be made known unto God. &gt;&gt; In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. That's good advice. &gt;&gt; So, whatever it is that you're praying to God for, whatever it is that you're coming to God and and you have a request, let your request be made known with a thankful heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:15, "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body, and be ye thankful." &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 4:E 2. &gt;&gt; Continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Do you think the word of God is trying to get something over? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; To the elected of God. &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell us, hey, be ye thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a thankful heart. Have an attitude of gratitude before God. and and and I'm going to get into it a little bit. Having an attitude of gratitude, it doesn't depend on what's going right and what's going wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it says, "Be ye thankful. &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful in the good times. Be ye thankful in the bad times. Be ye thankful in the middle of the road. At all times, be ye thankful." Amen. &gt;&gt; Throughout the scripture, it's very evident to us that God loves a thankful heart. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the circumstances that surround us, &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't tell us, well, as as as long as things are going right and as long as this is good and as long as that's good in the family and money and job and and and as long as everybody's healthy and praise the Lord, then I'll be super thankful. As long as I get a boyfriend, then I'll be thankful. As long as I get a girlfriend, then I'll be thankful. No, &gt;&gt; we're not to wait until the good happens in our life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we are to be thankful at all stages of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being thankful is directly correlated with our attitudes. And our attitude is directly correlated with our faith towards the promises of God. And and our faith will determine whether the promises of God come to pass in our lives. So our being thankful is correlated with with with our attitude and our attitude is correlated with our faith and our faith. It all depends on our faith for the promises of God to come to pass in our lives. &gt;&gt; Where does it start with? It starts with being thankful. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Without money or without price, 1959, paragraph 105 for the brothers." Sure, they were thankful. They were grateful. And any man or woman that's born of the spirit of God and receives the Holy Ghost will always be thankful. No matter whatever happens, you'll be grateful. So a person that has received the Holy Ghost, brother Brandham says they will always be thankful no matter what happens. &gt;&gt; No matter what has happened in your past, &gt;&gt; no matter what has happened in your family, &gt;&gt; but a Holy Ghostfilled person will always be thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham associates thankfulness and healing of the body together many many times. The brass serpent 1953 paragraph 171. You want to get over the female trouble and the arthritis and and and things like that. Just go on off the platform thanking God for it. &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do. &gt;&gt; Be thankful. He's done it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't pray a long prayer over him. &gt;&gt; He didn't anoint him with oil. No. He said, "All you have to do &gt;&gt; is be thankful. &gt;&gt; Walk off the platform and thank God for what he has already done." &gt;&gt; You see, that's where Brother Brandon was wanting us to get to. He says, "The work is already finished. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Healing is already ours. Salvation is for our families. We just have to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Thankful before it happens. &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and thank God. &gt;&gt; He's not saying thank God for already healing you in this body, but thank God for the work that he's already done that he's already healed you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did that make any sense? It may not have happened in the natural body, &gt;&gt; but he's saying be thankful for what God has already done. &gt;&gt; And when we're thankful for what he has already done, God loves a thankful worshipper. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does &gt;&gt; because it is correlated with our attitude. And brother Brandham said this, the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So it's not necessarily mental. &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily well I got to think positive &gt;&gt; and and I got to and I got to think it in my mind. Take the mental out of it. &gt;&gt; The right attitude &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God &gt;&gt; will bring it to pass in our lives. We see the word mental and we think psychology and and we think that psychology. But brother Brandham's not talking or preaching psychology. He's preaching the right attitude because our attitude is correlated with our thankfulness. And when we're thankful and our attitude is good, it'll bring the promises of God to pass in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let's read another one. Whatever he says to do, do it. 1953. Oh father, as this poor little old hand lays over here in mine, know that maybe it's stroked back the tears of many crying baby's eyes and rock the cradle. Maybe in a younger day the little baby would get hurt and come. Mother, you'd kiss away the tears and rock them away and it'd be all right. But God, I'll take your hand to wipe the tear tonight to rock away the things. But thou can do it. Lord, I pray that you'll grant it. May she be healed tonight. Now I lay hands upon her in the name in Jesus' name for her healing. God bless you, sister. Go happy and rejoicing. Be thankful to God and you'll get well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's plain. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So what brother Brandham is and it and this just runs right along in the scriptures and it runs along brother Brandham's ministry. You can you you can there's there's hundreds of quotes where he would take people he said well just go on and be thankful. He said be thankful to God and you'll get well. I wonder is there sickness amongst us because we are unthankful. how easy it is for us as as mortal beings to get hardened and for our spirit to get hardened and we become unthankful without even realizing it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I remember uh I painted brother Ezra's dad's house and uh and um who was up there? What's his name? Uh brother Bill Bezy Painting. Used to be Basy Painting. He used to own it. Uh, and so I was talking to him anyway and I said, "Man, what what's your secret? What was your secret?" You know, he sold the business and then he started again and he this guy was just a business starting machine, you know? He's just good at making money. And um I tell me your secret. I want to know your secret. He goes, "You want me to tell you what I did, brother Steve?" "Yeah, tell me. What Google thing did you use? What marketing did you use? You know, I I want to know." He says, "For every job that I did, I was thankful." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Wow." &gt;&gt; He said, "When I would go to a customer's house and I would walk up to the door, I say, "Father, thank you so much for this opportunity to serve this person." And here I am thinking, "Ah, it's something great, something fantastic, something that you have to spend a bunch of money to do. &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful." He says, "I was thankful and God blessed my business." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; And I kind of realized back then, I guess by not being thankful, you're being unthankful. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. &gt;&gt; Right. And so by not sharing to the Lord, sharing to your mom, sharing to your dad, sharing to your spouse, whoever it may be, that that that's friends and family and loved ones and people that you're connected with by not showing them that you're thankful for them in your life, you're actually showing that you're unthankful &gt;&gt; because you're not showing that you're thankful. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; To have an attitude of gratitude towards one another. towards our spouses, our husbands and our wives and our children and and whatever it is. Be thankful for the people that God has placed in your lives &gt;&gt; because not showing the thankfulness and the gratefulness and and and and and those things we are actually being unthankful. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And a person who is unthankful is unhappy. Person who is unthankful is they turn into a brat I guess would be a good way to put it. There's a scripture where it says unthankful and it talks about murderers and all these different things and at the end it says unthankful. &gt;&gt; Wow. I wonder how many of us would put our name in that part of the scripture that we're fulfilling of murderers and this and that and the other, but yet we're there at the very end being unthankful. &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thought, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because by not showing our gratitude to one another, we are actually being unthankful &gt;&gt; towards one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Who wants to help somebody that's unthankful? Once, twice, three times. Have someone else to help you. Haven't said thank you one time. There's been no gratitude. &gt;&gt; There's been no I appreciate you. Thank you for what you've done for me. I really appreciate it. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, if you just be thankful to your parents, they'd do a whole lot more for you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amazing. We were camping up in up in Flag over the weekend there and um and Brother Luke Neil, come over to me. They were playing um capture the flag at dark time and the kids just loved it. This is just so much fun. And he goes, "Man, brother Stephen, you know what? three out of your four kids came over to me and they told me, "Thank you so much." I said, "They did? Who was the one who didn't?" He was bragging on my three kids and I was wondering who didn't, you know, and and and I was and he said, you know, I really appreciated that &gt;&gt; little little kids came up to me. Thank you for playing with us and for doing that with us. &gt;&gt; Made him feel good. It would make him to where if we go next year again, he'll want to do it even better. Why? Because he realizes, hey, these kids are thankful. They enjoy what we're putting on for him. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you told your pastor, "Thank you. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you sent him a text and just saying, "Thank you, brother Ron. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you." When was the last time you did that? &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, your phone is going to be overloaded tomorrow. And you know what? He's going to respond back. Thumbs up. If you know, you know. The Queen of Sheba 1960 for your baby. Many suffer from the same disease. Do you believe its little heart will get well and it'll be all right? Do you believe, Father God, the baby's too little to have faith? May it be well in the name of Jesus, in Jesus Christ's name. Look at that prayer. So simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't doubt the baby will live. Go home and be thankful to God. Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was trying to show to the people that no matter what lays before them, if they would just be thankful to God and what he has already done at Calvary, that things would begin to change. He told us time and time again that the work has already been finished and that if Jesus was here in a body uh like like me with a suit on right now, he could do nothing more for us because he's already done it all at Calvary. &gt;&gt; So that's why he says he's already done it. The work is already finished. You don't have to worry about it. Just be and move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if nothing changes, just be thankful and move on. And if nothing changes, just be thankful and move on. And at some point in life, God will bring the change. Why? Because God loves a thankful worshipper. Because our thankfulness is correlated to our attitude, which is correlated with our faith. And without faith, it is impossible to please our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. True breath. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 6:15. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. Before we can have faith to receive healing from God, we must first of all get rid of all the uncertainty concerning the will of God in this subject. Excuse me. for us as believers to say if it be the Lord's will, this will happen. And if it'll be the Lord's will, when it's written within his word already that it is his will. If you say, "Well, if it be the Lord's will for this to happen, well, it'll happen." It pl it plants a little seed of doubt in our minds because then we think, well, maybe it's not the will of God. Maybe in order for this to happen of the healing of my body or whatever it may be, and the longer that it goes by, we begin to think in our minds, well, perhaps it's not for me and perhaps it's not the will of God. And it plants a little seed within our heart without us even realizing it. Because a lot of times we don't want to get so boastful and so proud I guess it would it would seem like to say father thank you for what you've already done. But we say well if it be the Lord's will I want to tell you in order there's too many scriptures and promises within the word of God that belongs to us for the healing of our bodies. and and and I feel I feel led to go down this direction of the healing of our bodies more than anything else for whatever reason. And so because we get so doubtful and we say, "Well, maybe it's not. Maybe it's not for me." But yet the word of God says this, it is for you. &gt;&gt; Healing is the children's bread. &gt;&gt; And we are children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. by God's election and by his fornowledge. &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says if you ask your father for h a bread, will he give you a stone? &gt;&gt; No. A loving father would never do that. &gt;&gt; And our heavenly father will never do that to us either. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me just refresh what brother Brandham said. Just go on and be thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what happens is when doubt is in the presence and it it it with within our spirit without us even really realizing it, it brings our attitude down &gt;&gt; and it takes away our thankfulness because it's opposite. Doubt uh and unbelief is opposite to the things of God. And so when doubt is present in our lives, it's hard for us to see the positive because the negative is taking over. &gt;&gt; When we see the scriptures, there's a few things that we must do. We must take the word of God and we must hide it within our hearts. And we must be as what the Lord told Joshua and meditate on these things night and day to keep our eyes fixed upon the promise that God has given us through his word. And when we saturate ourselves with the promises that's written within this word, we no longer are affected by temporal things. &gt;&gt; So it goes back to knowing who you are and where you come from. And it's and it goes back to the word of God. And it comes back to saturating our spirit and our mind with the promises of God for this hour. Because when we do that, it kicks out doubt &gt;&gt; and it kicks out fear and it kicks out the unknown because as believers, we have this understanding that all things will work together for the good to those who love God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so when we saturate ourselves with the word and with the message of the hour and with certain quotes and certain scriptures uh uh you know based around what it is that you're going through when you saturate yourselves with the with those things the things of the world it kind of takes a back step. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we don't we don't have it on our forefront anymore because the Bible is in our frontal &gt;&gt; uh vision now. &gt;&gt; But if we just accept the lie that Satan wants to tell us and if we just accept everything that's going on in life, before we know it, our faith is low &gt;&gt; because it's what we're feeding on. As the musicians come, we'll bring this to a close. Let me give you a a few scriptures this evening that it may be deposited into your hearts of the will of God concerning healing in your lives. You know, self-help stuff helps a little bit. But it doesn't deliver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It helps, but it can only take us so far. &gt;&gt; We can listen to podcasts and these nah, we need to listen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I was in Canada with brother Eugene, we went and we visited this brother who has MS and his body just absolutely deteriorating and and he was having a very hard time, difficult time and and so we were there and and we were encouraging him and you know uh brother Eugene is is a lot of fun to be around and um so as we were as we were leaving you know Um, we had a very nice special time and this brother opened up his heart and shared with me his testimony and shared with me how uh he had a child die and and and so on and so forth. And uh came into the message about five years ago and you see his family just a beautiful little family. And we had gotten done praying with him and he sat back down because he was getting tired. And he made a comment. He said, "You know, you know, brother, I I just try to encourage myself every day &gt;&gt; because he's getting to a place where he can't walk and he can't take care of himself." And he's a he's a young man. He's in his late 40s, early 50s, can't take care of himself, can't clean himself. And so he say, he said, "Brother, I just, you know, some days I just sit and I listen to self-help things and it encourages me." I said, "Brother, do you ever listen to Brother Brandham's messages outside of church?" He says, "No, I don't." I said, "Do you have the table app on your phone?" He says, "What's the table app?" &gt;&gt; Brother Eugene looks at me. I said, "Bro, Eugene, you take over." So, we got his phone. We downloaded the app on his phone the table. We showed him how to search quotes. We showed him how to listen to sermons. And it was just it was just amazing that, you know, he, Brother Eugene, told me, "Well, Brother Steve, it's amazing you caught that." I said, "I I I don't know." He goes, "I can't believe that he was he was there, been in my church all these years, and I just took it for granted." Yeah, &gt;&gt; that he knew the table lap. I just took it for granted that he was listening to sermons and and stuff, but now I realize he's not. And so, Brother Eugene told him, he said, "You need to start back in the late 50s at the apex of brother Brandham's second pull ministry of the healing of the body and so forth, and you need to you need to surround yourself." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not with self-help stuff, &gt;&gt; but by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because by doing this, it's going to ignite your faith. &gt;&gt; Self-help will only take you so far. But when faith arises, &gt;&gt; faith arises with with with muscles in its chest, with muscles on its arms. When faith arises, Satan trembles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us are are are getting off of the solid rock. How how many of us are are are you know what? I'm I'm just kind of bored. It's kind of boring. I need I need something better. I I need something I need something fantastic. I need some kind of feeling. I I need something cuz it's boring. Church becomes boring when your spiritual life is dead. It's not because the church is boring because there's other people that are growing and enjoying it and having a good time. But if you find church is boring, it's because there's something wrong spiritually within you. But you don't got to stay that way. &gt;&gt; You can go to your car and pray. On your way home, you can pray with your family. On your way home, you can tell your wife and kids you're thankful for them. And before you go to bed at night, lead each other in prayer and be thankful for one another. And I guarantee you, you'll see a change. &gt;&gt; A change will come. &gt;&gt; It'll break the ice. &gt;&gt; It'll take away the stony heart by simply being thankful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Markapter 9:23 Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Where does believing starts? It starts with being thankful. Isaiah 53:5, "But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities. Chastisement of our peace was upon him. With his stripes we are healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 2 24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live onto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; Acts 10:38. I got a few more scriptures. how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil. For God was with him. &gt;&gt; Is healing the children's bread? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Matthew 8 16 and 17. When the evening was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils. And he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Matthew 10 verse 7 and 8. And as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give. Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same yesterday &gt;&gt; and today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being thankful &gt;&gt; is a grateful language to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; As an act of worship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to you want to worship God a little bit. You want to you want to get out of your comfort zone and and really worship him, start by being thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Start by being grateful. No matter where we are in this stage of life or what's going on in our families cuz guess what? We all have something going on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, we might as well be happy. Not happy that it's happening, &gt;&gt; but thankful to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, thank you, &gt;&gt; thank you for what you've already done. &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you're doing in my life. Thank you what you're doing in my family's life. Thank you for what you're going to do in our lives. Thank you for what you're doing in our church. Thank you for my wife. Thank you for my kids. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Being thankful to God in a time where you should be unthankful is an act of worship. &gt;&gt; That is a sweet smelling savor &gt;&gt; in the nostrils of God. &gt;&gt; Your altitude with God will be determined upon your attitude of gratitude. In other words, the relationship that we have with God, our altitude, the how high that we that we come up hither into his presence is determined upon how thankful we are. &gt;&gt; It's dependent upon our attitude of gratitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] So let me ask you this evening, how has your attitude of gratitude been this past week, this past month, whatever it may be? How has your attitude been towards life, towards your spouse, towards family, towards kids, towards work, but most importantly towards God? &gt;&gt; Have you been letting the things of the world affect your walk with God? Have you let Leodysia creep into your spirit of of of lukewarmness and hardness and and and just coming to church and it becoming a a a a a tradition, it becoming a thing that we just do because we're Christians and that's what we do. We we go to church on a Sunday and we go to church on a Wednesday night, but yet we sit in church thinking about life and everything that's wrong and we become unthankful in our spirit. And then all of a sudden when God is trying to speak to us, we miss it. &gt;&gt; Because our attitude isn't right. &gt;&gt; Father, let my attitude &gt;&gt; be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've all been there. &gt;&gt; We've all had it happen to us and it's going to happen to us again. But I hope that this sermon can play back in your mind and say, &gt;&gt; "Father, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; For I know that your word says this. &gt;&gt; All things." Somebody say, "All things." &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; All things &gt;&gt; will work together for the good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To those who love God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And are called &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; So now we can look at it and say, "Well, I'm not enjoying this &gt;&gt; and my heart is hurting and this and that and the other. All of those things are true, but Father, &gt;&gt; thank you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I know you're doing something that I cannot see. &gt;&gt; You're doing something that I don't understand perhaps for further down the road. So I place my trust in thee, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I place my life in your hands. &gt;&gt; I place my life. Where else could I go, Lord? Where could we go? &gt;&gt; For thou alone hast the words of eternal life. Here I am, Lord. I place my all upon thy altar of sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sing I love you Lord. &gt;&gt; I love you Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord for your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been heling your hand. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my hands while the goodness of God. Hallelujah. All my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. And every breath that I am able I will see for you. Yes, Lord, I love yours. [Music] You have led me to the fire in your shine. You are most like you as a father. upon you as a friend. I am in the goodness of God. Oh yeah. All my life you have been. &gt;&gt; Oh my life. And all my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I ever [Music] see of the goodness of God. [Music] Your goodness is running after. Running after me. Your goodness is running after. Running after me. Lay down. I surrender now. Give you everything. [Music] Goodness is running out. running after me. [Music] &gt;&gt; All my life you have. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful my life you have been so so good. Thank him for being good. &gt;&gt; And breath I am &gt;&gt; I will sing the goodness of God. [Music] very good word tonight [Music] before I go to bed tonight. I want to thank him and I want to start right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank him &gt;&gt; for salvation. &gt;&gt; I thank him for healing. I thank him for God's people for I thank him for his choosing. &gt;&gt; You see, there were key phrases of what he and it and clicked. It wasn't you. You didn't choose yourself. God chose you. &gt;&gt; Be thankful. &gt;&gt; God lookketh not on the outward man. That's what man carnality looks at. But God looks at seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. because every seed will bring forth of its own kind. Church is boring to those who are unthankful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that we have a church. &gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of places right now they have nowhere to gather. &gt;&gt; Or they gather like over in Vonawatu. some of the outer islands, they had a little place where they were gathering and other people came and they beat them all up because they were gathering just in a a little shack. &gt;&gt; So they started gathering under a tree. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you know what? When persecution arise on the church, you get better. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not looking for self-help and podcasts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You want to get more from God, get more into the word, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And get thankful for all things. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Because thank him in the good times and thank him in the bad times. Not with the outward praising of man, but from the meek and gentle nature of the heart, being thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, it hit home when you thought about, you ever do something for somebody that's unthankful? Do it again and again. Finally. &gt;&gt; You kidding me? And then he said a key to some of you young kids. You want more from your parents? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, Dad, thank you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Thanks for the $10. Yeah, I asked for 50, but I got 10. Thank you. Thank you. You're the best dad. Okay, son. Here's 50, man. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; It works by being thankful. And I want to say thank you to every one of you. &gt;&gt; Because that's why this church is here. &gt;&gt; It's because of you. &gt;&gt; This isn't &gt;&gt; This isn't man. This is God. He's given us a place. &gt;&gt; He's given us ministry. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Stephen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Listen, I I like some of those deeper things, dimensions and this and that, graphs and charts and all this and ooh and awe, but this is what you'll take home and you will think about &gt;&gt; and you will pray about and you when situations arise tomorrow, you'll say, "Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take the negative. I'm going to take the positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I am so appreciative to God for all of his goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For all things will work together for the good. Brother Andy Bernard told me one time time he said, "You know what, brother?" He said, "All things will work together for the good." But didn't say everything would be good. &gt;&gt; That's right. But God will use the bad to produce good. &gt;&gt; So if there's something bad happening right now, just say, "Okay, there's going to be goodness come out of that." &gt;&gt; Because the trying of my faith is more precious to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Than pure gold. You want more of gold? Be thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And start praising him for the things before they happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And heavenly father, I thank you &gt;&gt; for come unto the house of God tonight &gt;&gt; and by the word being preached in simplicity. Father, &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord for you have spoken to my heart. Let me be more thankful &gt;&gt; to my family, to my children, &gt;&gt; to my wife, to those within the church, to the musicians, the song leaders, &gt;&gt; to those that are streaming the service right now, to th the cameramen, to the audio department, the ones that adjust the volume. Thank you, Father, &gt;&gt; for it's not made of one important person or but it's a body that works together for the good. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for everyone, for every part. Thank you, &gt;&gt; seen and unseen. I thank you for every mother and father, every child, everyone that calleth this their home church. I thank you for each and everyone. Father, I pray that you will bless us abundantly as we come back to church on Sunday. Remember the needs among our body. Remember Sister Sharon Johnson having lost her mother. Oh, sometimes these things happen, Father, and unexpectedly and somebody's taken out of our life and there's a void. But father, you can be a comforter. You can come and in the good times and in the bad. Give us a peace that passes all understanding. And Father, I pray that each one, Father, even that is here tonight will be part of that bridal company that'll enter in and will say unto each one. Enter now, my good and faithful servant. Enter into the joys of the Lord. And as your prophet said, then he will take and wipe away every tear. And over there there'll be no more sorrow. There'll be no heartache. There'll be no grieving spirits. It'll be entering into the joys of the Lord. And it has not even entered into the mind of man what you have prepared for your people. I thank you for this word tonight and I praise you. I give you thanks in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Amen. If we could, you get me the key. And brother Austin, if you know that. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us now and now. Let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. Because of what the Lord has done for us. [Music] Brother Martin Malumba, would you come dismissed now in a word of prayer? Amen. [Music] I'm happy that I was in church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hearing the word once again puts another part to the great puzzle of God. Amen. God bless you, Brother Martin. If you would dismiss in a word of prayer. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? Precious father, surely Lord, we ought to be grateful Lord for every single day, &gt;&gt; every single step along the way this journey that you have granted unto us. It can sometimes be tough and narrow and blurry, Father. a Lord looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; We are so grateful Lord that we are overcomers before the journey have ever started. Lord is so grateful Lord the understanding Lord that the pattern that you have given unto us is not to lean onto our own understanding but to look Lord Father God away unto you. Bless father, brother Steven, every single sons and daughters of God in whatever condition that we may be because all work together for the good &gt;&gt; to them that love you. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And that are called according to their purpose. And therefore we say thank you father. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; for giving us Lord this blessed assurance knowing that Lord that we shall be there. We shall make it. Therefore we say thank you father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you for every single thing that you've uh &gt;&gt; Yes Lord &gt;&gt; brought us through Father. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; through thick and thin. You said Lord that uh our test is uh more precious Lord than precious gold. We can have all the inheritance of the world. All this shall pass away. But Lord are these experiences that we shall one day sit around the throne and talk about these things. Therefore we are so grateful father. &gt;&gt; Go with us Lord as we're looking forward unto Lord the next service. Lord, &gt;&gt; give us traveling in mercies as we're looking away unto you. We ask with thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you. Thank you. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Turn around and say thank you to somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Shake their hand and just say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you. You are dismissed. Go in the name of the Lord. Be thankful and grateful unto God for all he has done. God bless you.
