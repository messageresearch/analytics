look upon the beauty of his face amen and we see the one who has saved us by his grace amen beautiful that's what we're longing for that's why we're here tonight let's pray father Lord we have gathered this evening in this place that that we might learn of you Lord many needs within the body father I ask that you would touch and meet each and every one Lord according to your word and purpose we ask your blessing upon this service tonight that you would be with brother Ron Lord as he's in the hospital father we're asking that Lord you would give him a Special Touch for your word declares Lord that by your stripes we are healed and so we're claiming tonight healing for our pastor your word also declares if two or more people would agree in any one thing that it would be accomplished and so we're agreeing tonight Lord we are uniting our faith together and we're asking father Lord touch him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet this pneumonia and these different things that's attacking his body we come against it now in in the name of Jesus Christ Lord not by any power or anything within ourselves but because your word declares it Lord and we're trusting in your word we love you tonight we thank you for your mercy and goodness bless your people we pray in a special way in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen amen praise the Lord God is good is he not amen certainly is thank you musicians God bless you didn't they do a wonderful job tonight amen yeah praise the Lord a few announcements here before we get started um did everybody see the the Rocks where the Rocks used to be here in the front of the church the rocks are no longer there and it's dirt and there's a big caution tape that's around the dirt you know what the caution tape means it means do not enter and when we pulled up the this evening uh I saw me and my wife we both looked at each other at the same time uhoh boys so uh you know families with young kids and everything I don't think we have to worry about the elderly playing in the dirt but uh you know families with young kids let's do our best uh first time obedience stay out of the dirt am and uh I believe what's happening is they're putting artificial turf in there and they're going to put a nice fence around it and um that's going to be a place for the kids to play on Sundays and stuff it's going to be very nice um also on Friday we have the memorial service for brother Gustavo Aila it's here at the church at 9:00 a.m. um so if you're available to come I'm sure the family would greatly appreciate that and of course uh let's continue to pray for brother Ron brother Ron as you all know has been admitted back into the hospital again and uh you know I'm sure the doctors and nurses there are doing their best to take care of brother Ron but he needs a a special touch and um and he has requested that that that he has no visitors um I don't even personally know what what hospital he's in um but let's just give brother Ron a little bit of space and a little bit of time to to get his health back together again and and before we know it he'll be here amongst us but uh if you would like to pray with us huh will will you make a h a promise that before you go to bed tonight you'll raise your hand and you'll say I'll pray for my pastor amen yeah because guess what your pastor has prayed for all of you and so now it's our turn now it's our turn to intercede for brother Ron amen amen godess bless you turn with me in your Bible to the Book of John chapter 1 I just have a simple thought here this evening and I trust it'll be a blessing to you John chap 1 and we'll read verses 1-5 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God Amen the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen uh verse 14 of the same chapter in the same book and it says and the Word was made flesh dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen you may be seated this evening I would like to take for a titled this evening the word and we read in our Bibles there that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and this same word we know was made flesh and it dwelt amongst us and it's kind of interesting whenever you begin to think of the word uh it's the most simplistic uh but yet a subject that is so deep and vast how do you begin to explain it right and so I trust that with God's help that he'll be able to help us this evening because God is known in Simplicity amen now when we talk about the word uh what does it really mean for us as Believers when we talk about the word or when we refer to the word is the word different than God is the word different than Jesus Christ and what does it mean to us as Believers when we talk about the word because we're always talking about the word and the ministry will get up and we'll talk about the word and we'll talk about the Bible and and really to us as individuals it is important for us to know what the word is it's important for us to know what the word was sent to accomplish and when we realize what the word is and who the word is it will give us a different Outlook upon the word because when we realize that the word our Bible as we know it it is not just a book uh like a novel or like a newspaper but it is something that is extremely Supernatural and so because it is a supernatural book it doesn't always just necessarily deal with our natural man but it deals with us as supernatural beings and so that's why it's important for us to realize our place within the word amen amen so uh like I said it's a very simple yet it's a complex subject to speak upon and because this word that we believe is a word that is eternal it is a word that was its author is a uh an infinite being and so how can we uh people who are finite in our thinking and carnal in our ways how can we begin to understand such a book of um uh that has been written by an infinite Eternal being how can a creature that has been born in time such as you and I how can we understand uh Eternal book and an eternal author there's only one way to understand this book there's only one way to understand its author and that's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so I'm praying this evening that that we as individuals and as a body that we take it into our into our hearts and into our lives and say father I want revelation I want revelation of your word that goes beyond my carnal understanding that goes beyond my carnal reasoning and the knowledge that I might be able to attain by just reading this book but father give me the Revelation to where I can read between the lines to where I can see the picture that lays within the picture because with our understanding as a man or as a woman or a boy or a girl we can get a a grasp of this book upon the top of it right we can we can get we can skim a stone you ever skim a stone at the water at the lake or wh youever you are and you skim and it goes yeah I got five skips and I got 10 skips and you know the secret to Stone skipping is get a smooth Rock get the rock that's the smoothest and that has the the the flattest bottom to it but we don't want to be just rock skimmers with the word of God but we want to go deep into the word of God and there's only one way to go deep into the word of God God that's by Supernatural Revelation that's given by God [Applause] himself I know one thing for sure in my own life and and I know that you can agree with me because you're here tonight because we all have the same desire and that's we're wanting a closer walk with God we're wanting to make the Rapture why else would we uh set aside our cares of life on a Wednesday night to come to church when it's difficult come to church on a Wednesday night it's difficult when you live on the other side of town and you have to make a sacrifice to come but the reason why you do it is because you're longing for more of God it's not just a ritual it's not just something you're doing otherwise when life got too hard you wouldn't come so I command you all this evening that you're here and that you're wanting to hear from God and I know that if there's more of God that were desire iring there's more of God that he wants to pour out in our lives and so I'm asking father Meet The Desires in the longings of our hearts and make yourself known Hallelujah now when brother Brenham talks about God it's very interesting he he says that even before God was God he dwelt alone in his thoughts here he was the self-existing one brother brandham says it's Elohim and here he was before there was Stardust before there was any kind of creation here was God by himself in a vast of nothingness but there he dwelt alone with his thoughts and brother brandom he he uses this this this analogy and I love it so much cuz I can picture in my mind when he's describing it he says here God was alone and he's Des Desiring fellowship and so all of a sudden there's a little Halo of light that appears brother brandham said that that is the logos of God Amen and so when we begin to think of the logos of God we look it up within within Strong's Concordance and it's the the concept are the very thought of God himself it is not a different entity it is not a different person it is not a different Spirit but it it is an attribute of God himself that came out of God now it's it's so wonderful when you begin to watch the condensating of God yes I don't want to jump ahead of myself but it's a beautiful thing because there's a reason why God begins to condensate understand from what he was in this vast of nothingness alone with his thoughts to where he wanted to get to because he has a journey in his mind he has this great drama in his mind that he's wanting to unfold and you're all saying amen because you know you're part of it you know you're part of the journey you know you're part of the Great drama of God hallelujah and so we see that this great logos of God it was God himself and God had a purpose within his heart he wanted to make himself snn in the sermon the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 brother brandham said let's just picture that as being a a white Halo coming out of that space that was the Son of God the logos so what was this little Halo that that came out of this vast of nothingness it was the son of God it was the logos it was the very uh concept and thoughts of God that was now beginning to materialize itself Hallelujah and there it was in space moving around like a little child playing before the door of its parent and he draw in his mind what should be and I can hear him look around and say there was nothing anywhere just a vast of space the father covered all the space and then this and then this God became bized down to the lugos I can hear him say let there be light and an an Adam bursted Yonder and the sun came into existence deity she began to whirl millions of years rolled by and after a while a p a piece flew off of it there was a star now watch this this is the beginning of the creation of God here can you picture it in your mind yes amen here's the sun he saying let there be light there might have been millions of years that passed and all of a sudden here it is brother brandham said that God believed in his own word if God believed in his own word in order to bring get to pass there's only one thing for you and I to do as Sons and Daughters of God and that's to believe the word and if we believe the word by simple faith God will bring it to pass in our lives he says and he stood out there and watched it and it and and it went all down and he stopped it over here after a while it it fell a few million years off went another one he let it fall near a certain place and he stopped it what's he doing he's got in his mind now that somebody there will be on earth I wonder who that somebody would be there will be mankind on Earth God is from above he's writing the Zodiac in the sky zodiac starts with the Virgin the first coming of Christ ends up with Leo the Lion the second coming and he's writing his first Bible there's three of them and we all know what the three bibles are the first Bible is the Zodiac in the heaven the second Bible was the pyramids that Enoch built and the third Bible that we have is this one that we can read right here why because God is perfected in threes so he created the sun he created the stars and the moon and and God had a purpose for all those things in the natural because he knew that there would be people that would be dwelling here on planet Earth and so he made the son for a purpose purpose he made the moon for a purpose he made the stars and everything for a purpose that it would all run together so that this planet Earth would be livable come on so when the people of the earth when they look at the Moon what do they see they go wow look at that thing I wonder if we could land a man on the moon someday they look at the Moon and they say wow that thing is is so amazing just look at it look how it how it how it how it keeps the tide and the water from only going so far upon Earth and look how the the Moon is given for signs and for seasons and all these things and it absolutely captivates the mind of scientists and Mankind but when the believer looks at the moon the believer looks at the Moon just a little bit differently when we look at the Moon we sure we can look at it in it's natural but we look at it spiritually and we say wow look at that thing it's a reflection of the sun when the sun isn't here just as the Bride is a reflection of the Son of God when he's been absent here on Earth and so though God gave it for a a multi-purpose he's hiding himself in plain view he's given the moon for people to look at but he's given it to the bride because he's telling his story he's unfolding his drama of this journey Hallelujah thank you Lord so what is the moon spiritually it is God writing his story writing his story but he's hiding it in plain view he's hiding it to the world and he's revealing it to babes such as we' learn look at the stars it's the exact same thing people make millions of dollars uh astronomers and things and they and they look at the stars and they look at at the galaxies and they can take their phone out and they can and they can put their phone up against the stars and they can say oh wow wow there's Orion's Belt wow there's this one and there's that one and they can put all these constellations together and it's such a a wonderful thing for mankind to look at but when the believer looks at the stars they look up and they say wow I see myself up there I see my representation up there in the sky why because he told Abraham that you're seed look at the stars look at them look at all of them that's what your seed is going to be so when the believer looks at the stars they're not just looking at it naturally but they're looking at the plan of God Amen from the Virgin to Leo the Lion and we say wow look at the plan of God that he has written within the skies how amazing is this what is it it is God hiding himself in plain view but he's revealing himself to babes such as would learn thank you Lord we could look at nature and people look at trees and they look at the grass they look at pretty flowers and all these different things and they wonder and they say my nature is such a wonderful thing yeah isn't it amazing how the seasons change in this tree uh all of a sudden it can it can be in full bloom and then at a certain season it looks like it's dead there's no life in it I don't know about you but sometimes I feel like within my own life that the four seasons of nature my my life presents it in a single 24-hour day oh I can be on fire for God and I can be a big old Burly tree Full of Life full of fruit and then all of a sudden I could be as dry as a as a barnyard floor I could be I I I could be losing my leaves I could be losing my fruit and all of a sudden it could look like I'd be dead in the water and then all of a sudden a few hours later wow I'm starting to feel good again praise the Lord amen four seasons of life in one day it's like I'm living back in Ireland again people they look at this stuff and they say wow that's amazing but as the bride when we look at nature we see death we see burial and we see resurrection and we say wow God I'm looking at your nature what is it that I'm looking at yeah I can see the the natural things that's going on but I see The Plan of Redemption when I look at a tree and when I look at the grass and when I look at the seasons it's not just the natural things I'm looking at but it's the supernatural things it's the plan of God his his plan is written all around us it's hidden in plain sight it's hidden from those who aren't supposed to see it but it's revealed to those who are ordained to catch the mysteries of God am thank you Lord understand sometimes in your life that God will be hidden in plain view according to your flesh man your C taste feel smelling here you'll be looking for God I don't see him you'll be feeling for God I don't feel his presence I don't feel them around me I I don't feel like my prayers are being answered I I don't feel good I I don't feel I don't see I don't touch I can't taste I what is it God is still there because his word has declared it I'll never leave you I won't ever forsake you but I'm going to be with you don't worry about it don't worry what loud isia has to throw your way don't worry about what kind of sickness comes against you or comes against your pastor I'm in control God is in control tonight and he said he be with us God is hidden Amen in plain sight so instead of looking for God as as people will look at the stars and the moon and all these different things we need to step out by faith amen and say father this is what your word has declared and because your word has declared it I believe it and therefore by faith I'm reaching out and I'm going to say I believe your word more than I believe myself I believe your word word more than what I believe what I can see taste feel smell or hear why because the word will never let you down because the word is God thank you Lord and He swore by himself because he could swear by no one greater if he was to swear by you and I guess what we would let each other he would let us down it would just be a complete mess but because we're depending upon God who never sleeps nor does he Slumber because we're depending upon God who believed in his own word to bring it to pass guess what amen everything will be all right praise God tell yourself it's going to be okay tell your neighbor it's going to be all right tell your neighbor that God is in control you say brother Steven when will he fulfill the promise I don't know it doesn't matter when he's going to fulfill it just hold on to it [Applause] [Music] you say brother Steven that's easier said than done it is for the carnal man but by faith Abraham what did Abraham say his faith didn't grow weaker as he got older his faith didn't grow weaker as he got weaker in body but his faith grew stronger amen it seems like the church is weak but we're not weak because God is perfected in our weakness so don't look at the circumstances look to God God will bring his word to pass God will take care of things God will take care of the situations in our families and our loved ones and sicknesses and our children God will take care of it you just got to give it to him I hit a little bit of inspiration over in vanatu a lot of them they were they were uh they're struggling with their kids it felt like they were losing their kids and I remembered of the story of Hannah how that before God would bless Hannah with a child Hannah had to say father if you give me a child I'll give the child to you first she had to say Lord I give this child to you if you will give me a child God is wanting us to give our children to give our families over into the hands of God and God will take care of the rest of it us help us it's like brother Bram you remember when his wife got sick or not his wife his mama was sick onto death and here he is he's up there and he's preaching and he makes a a a statement and and he says you know how do you think I can stand up here and preach like nothing like nothing is wrong because in his own mind and in his heart nothing was wrong because he knew who hands his mom was in amen hallelujah trust God trust God for your needs trust God for your circumstances he wants us to live our lives by faith Hallelujah faith is not believing that God might come on faith is not hoping and sympathizing and saying well he might if it is his will but faith speaks with a boldness amen and faith says that God will amen it doesn't matter of the timing timing has nothing to do with it but Faith speaks with a boldness and says God will and I believe it hallelujah amen hallelujah amen the world sees one thing yeah as it looks at this planet Earth and the galaxies and all these different things the world sees one thing but the bride sees another though we're both looking at the same thing he take your Bible for instance there's 900 plus denominations and they all preach from the same word and why is it that we are so different in our lives and how we conduct ourselves why can they read the same Bible that we can read but yet our our sisters dress in modest apparel why is it that they can read the same Bible that we can read and as men we say no I don't go to those places I don't say those things I don't do those things I don't act that way even though we're reading the same Bible it's because we're seeing something different we're not looking at it like it's a newspaper or some kind of Novel but we're looking at it and reading Between the Lines by prophetic Insight amen and because we have a prophetic Insight it gives us the vision of God hallelujah hallelujah that's what makes us different is because we have a prophetic Insight that we're looking between the lines and we say that's not what pleases God this is what pleases God oh thank God for a prophetic Insight thank God for prophetic glasses is that we can look upon the word in in Ultra HD and we can go wow and we can look at the things in nature and we can go wow I'm not seeing what other carnal people are seeing but I'm seeing something completely different you Lord thank you Lord am thank you Lord hallelujah and brother bram's own Ministry speaking of the third pool we realize that the third pool was done openly am it wasn't done in secret that's right it was recorded it was put on tape it was done before brethen it was preached before people it was preached before denominations they saw the same Cloud that we see they've saw the same picture in Life magazine that we look at but when we look at the picture we see something complet completely different God hiding himself in plain view but revealing himself to those who are supposed to see it we're looking at the same thing we're looking at the same picture but we're seeing something completely different with our hearts oh what a God we serve how happy should that make us tonight to realize who we are and to realize that God has opened the eyes of your understanding and he said no take it you're you're looking at it William brandom like everybody else is looking at it turn it turn the thing turn it stop looking at it with carnal interpretations but look at it through my insight oh my it ain't just some Cloud it ain't some airplane or rocket that flew up there and made this this thing happened no it's the the white wig yeah oh he's a judge and what is he doing he is coming to judge This World by his word turn it wow I'm looking at the same picture I'm seeing what they're seeing others are walking away and they're and they're saying this and that about it when I see it I see the perfect outline of his face amen I see the perfect outline of his wig I see the the seventh angel with his SW his wings swept back I see it I see the picture within the picture why do I see it because we're ordained to see it thank you Lord what a God we serve am amen third pole of his ministry it was hidden in plain sight yes right right right it was a secret pool at a it's a pool that he that he that he wasn't supposed to say anything about made a mess of the first two pools ah William brandom all you've done is make a bunch of carnal impersonations this one don't teach them don't try to teach Pentecostal babies spiritual things because they can't handle it because they're babies they just want to play with the gifts they just want to play around out here with feeli good stuff but when it comes time to get in line with the word they don't want it they can't handle it but when the word comes and it strikes your heart and he's telling us to get back in step we say yes sir amen why because we have representation we have representation from God [Applause] Almighty and standing back amen amen it hurts it's kind of hard to live but I say amen amen it's kind of hard to do so sometimes but I say Amen anyways people look at the this part of his ministry they say he got off but we're looking at the same Ministry we listen to the same sermons we read the same books and we say he didn't get off he got on Amen word what was he doing riding the trail Hallelujah John 14: 19 yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me Hallelujah because I live ye shall live also the world is not going to see me anymore I'm going to be hidden in plain sight they're not going to see me but you're going to see me and so the works that I did you're going to do also why because you see me you see the word being fulfilled how do we see him today not just in each other we see him by the revealed word that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen Matthew 1310 through1 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven amen but to them it is not given they heard the same messages they heard the same sermons they heard the same words but to them it was in Parables why because they didn't have a teacher Hallelujah they didn't have a teacher to teach them what the truth of the parable was the Holy Spirit is the what the revealer of Truth he the spirit of Truth and so when we've been sealed of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost what happens the spirit of Truth Now reveals unto us The Parables given to one not given to another one the same Parable the same sermons the same Bible as God hidden in plain sight hallelujah thank you Lord the deity of Jesus Christ 1949 like someone was speaking the other day he said God what was he when he was back young millions and millions of years ago just like this space here and then he gathered up into the lugos and then he came from the lugos down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth it's not separate people it's not separate entities it's not separate spirits but it's God that's condescending himself down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth then going right back into God again don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down through space from eternity rolling together coming down into the logos from the logos there into man then returning back again for one purpose Hallelujah to redeem that man that had fallen praise the Lord now when I read that quote I begin to think when did he begin to condescend amen did he begin to come down whenever Jesus died upon the cross for our sins did he begin to come down whenever Adam fell in the Garden of Eden no he began to condescend Before Time Ever began he began to cond descend before there was ever Stardust before there was any creation before there was any Angels before there was any sin because he had one purpose in his mind that he wanted to redeem those that would need redeemed who were in his mind since before the foundations of the [Applause] world so God had you in his thought thank you Lord long before you ever sinned God had you in his thoughts long before you ever made a mistake God had you in his thoughts long before there was ever sin Stardust or anything to do with creation that makes you a very special person in the mind of God hallelujah that he would condescend because in his mind he had a plan he had he had this drama that certain people would begin to unfold and be a part of oh Hallelujah that makes you very special makes you very unique hallelujah amen and it should make you realize that this flesh man that you deal with this guy that's full of sin this guy that's full of iniquity let me tell you something that don't mean nothing cuz the price has already been paid oh thank you Lord Lord long before you ever fail long before you ever needed a savior it was already provided Hallelujah and so long before that you ever going to make a Rapture God has already made the way for it to happen we don't have to push up or push out jump up or make anything happen no we just got to live our lives and let God take care of the rest amen hallelujah when we see God he was just changing his mask amen he was making himself known he was making his attributes and his characteristics known through the logos and then through Jesus Christ and then when he went from Jesus Christ he ascended back up on high right amen back to where he was in the beginning that's right he says I came from God I'm going back to godall but I'm not going to leave you comfortless cuz I'm going to be with you and so here was Paul Paul was walking down the Damascus Road and he meets this light this Halo something very Supernatural was happening in his life he was out there with his own carnality his own reasoning his own knowledge his own teaching from Gia persecuting the church but when he sees this light it brings him to his knees and he says Lord tell me who you are I want to know your name who are you he said I am Jesus who you're persecuting Jesus had already been dead buried and resurrected but when he was persecuting his bride when he was persecuting his body he was persecuting him what was he doing he was revolving going back to what he was to the glory that he had with the father in the beginning not a different person not a different entity Hallelujah not a different Spirit but it's God it's God who who dwelt in vest of nothing it was God in the lugos it was God in Jesus Christ and it's God and you and I it's the same God it's not a different spirit it's not a different person but it's God himself wow and the bright says wow that's amazing how can God dwell in me I don't know but he does [Applause] it [Applause] Hallelujah if you were in his mind then and he cared enough to condescend understand you're still in his mind now and he still cares amen thank youus hallelujah hallelujah God cares for your every need God cares about all of your situations in life just put your trust in him so what is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us the word is God so when I read my Bible what am I reading God when I read the word what is it that I'm reading I'm reading about his attributes amen I'm reading about his characteristics I'm reading about what he likes and I'm reading about what he doesn't like it's not just some book that was pieced together but it's the anointed Eternal infinite word of God that he put on paper for us to read that we might understand him excuse me amen so how do you understand God by revelation of God himself how do I understand his characteristics I just flip the pages and I say father give me that spiritual Revelation that I need to get me through this life's journey but not only that Lord I have a desire that I might understand stand you you know what he's saying read the word amen because when you're reading the word you're reading God is that too simple it's a fact amen it is so how do we become closer with God in our lives read the word amen be a part of God take the little book John and don't just take it and look at it come on but take it and eat it because what you eat becomes a part of you let this word become a part of you John don't let it get dust in your house don't have to dust it off every couple of weeks before you read it no take it John eat it John become it John and walk it amen hallelujah as the musicians come we'll bring this to a close my brother and my sister we need to stop reading our Bibles like it's some kind of newspaper musicians where where's our musicians yeah come come come praise the Lord you weren't ready to come were you they want more to much of the time guilty of it myself we read the word because we have to we read the word because it's our duty as a Christian oh well suppose I should read my Bible today reading our Bibles with this kind of attitude doesn't get us anywhere with God that's right nope right it's just reading that's right we're just getting a an understanding and a lot of the times depending where you're reading in your Bible you won't understand it wow all I see is oh he numbered this one and numbered that one okay yeah yeah and this one and to this tribe there was this amount and to that tribe there was that okay yeah yeah okay very good I'll turn somewhere else I'm not quite catching anything here let me turn to somewhere else within the scripture oh H Ezekiel my there's a wheel within the wheel what does that mean I don't understand I I'm reading it and and I'm not understanding it it's because of our attitude sometime and how we approach God instead of reading it because we have to read it we should say father I'm going to read your word and I'm going to hold it to my heart amen because th word oh God have I hid in my heart because my heart is such a sacred place it's not something that I want to share with just any body and because it's so sacred Lord I want you to be a part of my heart and so now Lord I'm taking your word and before I read it I realize that this is you and you're trying to show me something you're trying to show me a shadow you're trying to show me a type you're trying to show me something in my life you're before all I see is numbers all I see is tribes and numbers but when God begins to deal with us amen by Revelation don't be surprised when God shows you something different about that tribe when God reveals to you what the wheel inside the wheel is when God begins to show you that hey these things that you didn't understand before I'm going to reveal it to you why because your attitude is different am because your approach is different when we approach God and we say father yes let me read between the lines let me see the picture that's within the picture father and watch God deal with your heart yes praise the Lord watch God begin to open the understanding of your heart and as you flick through the pages things change things begin to open up why because your approach is different to God because when we are approaching his word to read it we are approaching God himself amen just the same as when we when we pray there's an approach to God about certain things amen but there's a special approach toward his word the word that's good it's not just a word right it's not just a sword come on it's not the sword of a king but it's the sword of the king this is not just a word a word this is not just a compilation of compilation of books that have been putting together to make one big book but this is the word hallelujah of the one true God who makes himself known through the word amen yes Hallelujah let me just drive it home and clinch the nail as brother Ron says when you read the word approach him correctly yes very good approach him in the right way approach reading your word like you're approaching the very throne room and presence of God itself because that's what it is yeah anybody can flip through it anybody can read it but God is hidden in plain sight you can read the word and it'll be hidden from you but understand he's hiding between the verses he's hiding between the stories he's hiding between the Shadows why is he hiding because it's not given to everybody to understand it oh Hallelujah but he's waiting for you to approach him in the right way that he might say here you [Music] go here I am here I am within the word here I am within the story here I am within the type and when he begins to reveal himself of who he is he doesn't stop there amen oh beautiful but he continues to reveal him because what good is it if he reveals himself but he doesn't Reveal Your Part within the word amen so when he begins to reveal himself now he opens your understanding to my goodness I'm Rebecca I'm the bride that's me I almost can't can't believe it tell your flesh man to shut up because it's your spiritual man it's the seed that God has imparted within you that's what's crying out and that's what's realizing who I really am and why I'm here and where I'm going amen God bless you let's stand this evening together hallelujah thank you Lord we could have the words [Music] please light in the darkness my God that is who you are way maker Miracle Worker
