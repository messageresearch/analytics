in God's Great creation they have taken the time to set aside to honor God on the resurrection and when you honor God God will honor you you cannot do something for God but what God will do something for you amen even brother Johnny and Linda Green are up in Seaside Oregon he didn't send me a photo it's probably too pretty so he uh but there they said brother Ron we are under expectation of the word uh I have a baby dedication this morning and uh let's sing that song bring them in bring them in if brother uh Andrew and sister Anissa Kennedy would like to make their way up if they would come

everything now let me just do you pronounce that Alden and Rafe amen God bless you come a little closer here wow how heavy is he he's okay he's okay yeah he's awake he's awake he is okay you wanna say hello to everybody yeah you check out the pastor here huh yeah yeah okay God bless you brother Andrew sister Anessa you fell in love and a little while later God gives to you a love gift are you going to talk to me yeah he is and with that we know that God gives you great responsibility that means to raise your children up in the admonition and nurture of God teach them God's ways don't tell them live the ways before that they see it in your life and may he be blessed all the days of his life and we pray that he will be part of that Bridal company that he will go yeah he's smiling he's excited what I'm saying right now this kid yeah you're sharp aren't you buddy yeah you yeah you like that we're gonna dedicate this little son back to God it's found in Luke chapter 18. verse 15 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them and Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein so they brought little children that he would bless him Come a Little Closer they have named him Alden Rafe and I didn't have it printed out here so I have to I'm sorry just take a moment here it is the English name Alden means an old friend it means wise protector that's a good combination and we choose it not only because it's a strong family name in Andrews lineage but we pray that he's a real friend to all like Jesus was and stands up for the truth and those around him Rafe has several meanings from different languages God has healed in Hebrew a wise wolf an Old Norse and kind and compassionate in Arabic so we're going to pray right now over Alden Rafe and we're going to ask God to let him be a wise protector and an old friend to those that He makes friends with and may God give him the wisdom and the discernment of who he brings close to him that he calls friends let's pray heavenly father as I lay my hands upon Alden Rafe now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bring him to you father to be dedicated back to you for a life of service would you watch over him and keep him all the days of his life father I pray that as his mother and father teach him thy ways o God that he will sit and listen and he will learn and God you will reveal yourself to him as you did to Abel I pray heavenly father that you would give him a life of health and happiness I pray that he will be a blessing to his mother and father that he will be an obedient son father I pray now a blessing upon Alden Rafe I bless you in the name of Jesus Christ and back to God from whence your life was given may God bless you all the days of your life I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen look at it yeah that kind of mesmerizing right there okay catch the there we go all right thank you God bless you so much God bless you Andrew amen and we also brother Israel and sister Mariah I'd like to pray over them if they'll come here at this time they've just recently got gotten engaged we showed the photo of that a while back and sometimes I'm privy to some of these things and other times I'm the last in the church to know but I wasn't with them brother Israel was so gracious to come to me he told me some of the plans and what he was wanting to do and everything and we've watched the two of you grow up in this church we've seen you become both very very faithful and we know that at times in our lives and as young people you struggle and you try to find an identity but when God comes to you and gives you revelation you realize who you are you take your position and once you take your position and you know who you are and then she finds her position and then the two of you coming together then what God does is he gives you an umbrella of authority that goes over both of you because your identity is in this word we don't take it out of the world we don't take it out of anything from Hollywood we take it out of his holy word and we're proud of both of you and we know that even as Joseph was his spouse to marry and and they were going to Bethlehem and everything and he had a dream and she found he found out she was already with child so he went to put her away and the angel said fear not Joseph to take Mary thy wife they were espoused it is the promise of God that marries you in God's eyes though he had never touched her he'd never lived with her as husband and wife at that time and so right now we know that the promise of God has is what god holds you accountable to and and stuff but it isn't until after the ceremony that you go and you live as husband and why so live clean live before God let these young people and let everyone around see okay this this Holiness that the two of you have that when you come together and and you kiss for the first time that it be in the right way in the right direction because God will truly bless you if you'll do what he says to for you to do we love the two of you we're proud of you and we're going to ask God's blessings upon the two of you Heavenly Father as I bring before you now and before this company of people and a family I bring these two before you father that they have saw fit Lord that they would choose one another and I pray that you will bless this Union o God this promise that has been made one to another and I pray that you will keep them till that day when they are married before the people that their lives would be a testimony father to all around them I thank you Father for giving us faithful couples faithful in you Lord because we know you are the one that hold us together and so father I bless them both in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and would you watch over them and keep them I pray in Jesus name amen amen do we have a a date yet of what we're looking at not end of October sometime okay look at your couple venues yeah yeah okay we'll wait it's still a mystery but it will be revealed all right God bless you amen praise the Lord we also have a family here that Amos has invited Humberto and Maggie and their kids where are you would you stand up so that we can greet you yeah yeah she's got a baby in her arms yeah God bless you it's a blessing to have you here God bless you richly amen thank you you may be seated God bless you amen um you know I've been seeking the mind of the Lord I do with every sermon every sermon is conceived in inspiration and birthed in labor I labor and I wait before God on many things to give because I'm not here to just tickle your ear I'm not here to just say nice words I want to say something that has an effect amen and I don't want to be religious I want to be a Christian and I want to live a life that is an example of my Lord and the reason I am here this morning is I fell in love with Jesus Christ and guess what I'm more in love with him today than I was when he first revealed himself to me and that's a reason why I'm here amen and I've I just had a thought uh that had come to me and I prayed about it and I and I labored and and as I always do but I want to preach to you about losing our simplicity let us stand together if you would as we take our Bibles together I want you to turn with me to Second Corinthians 11. thank you musicians God bless you second Corinthians chapter 11 verses one through four and sister Teresa van art brother Ronnie God bless you it's good to have you here this morning may God bless your hearts and give you the desire of your heart amen we miss you when you're not here you give our love and greetings to brother Johan amen second Corinthians 11. verses one through four what to God you could bear with me a little while in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy this is unusual that God would be jealous and that there would be such thing as a Godly jealousy every true wife wants her husband to be jealous over her yeah she likes that Paul said I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for of he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which he have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him may God bless the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in his presence I wish to take from verse 3 I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted in the Simplicity that is in Christ those words spoke volumes to me and I wish to title my sermon this morning losing our simplicity now before I go on I received a correction in my back room because the Brethren came to me because I actually spelled it l-o-o-s-i-n-g loosing our Simplicity and my granddaughter Kailyn her great wisdom and ability with the English language and he said does he mean losing or losing I even asked my wife this morning and both of us she said no I think it's two o's and I say I think so too then I felt it and I said no I think it's 10 anyway it doesn't matter it is losing 1-0 losing our Simplicity and I want to take for a thought and I am going to launch off for a next couple Services about Simplicity and what God does in Simplicity because we know that God is revealed in simplicity remember of all of the greatest sermons that the prophet preached and he's preaching a set of sermons called the revelation of the Seven Seals and he says but before I go and preach the revelation of the seals I feel very much led to tell you that God is revealed in simplicity so he lays the foundation for them to understand that the great Revelation that is about to come forth will be revealed in simplicity in second Corinthians 1 It also says for our rejoicing in this the testimony of our conscience that in Simplicity and godly sincerity not with the fleshly wisdom with the grace of God I want all of you to to know that God is not understood by education you can't prove God by science in fact some of the greatest minds and philosophers and different ones and scientists have said we have looked into this great Cosmos and we've looked into the infinite and we've looked into the finite and whether we look out in the great Cosmos and we we look with telescopes and we can see millions of light years and we can take a microscope and we can now look into the finite and we can look at atoms and nuclei and we can look at DNA and we can see all of this and so from the finite to the infinite every one of them see we can tell you with an assurance that God's fingerprints are from the infinite to the finite this just didn't happen with a bang but so what if it was a bang I don't care because all we know is God said let there be light and bang there was light and God began to create and everything that God created he created by speaking the word and the Bible says that the serpent was more subtle than all of the beasts that word subtle you look at it in the subtlety that it had and the Bible says that the serpent was more subtle than all of the beasts the serpent was a title of an animal he was a beast he was an upright being that was as close to mankind that you could get now when I was in high school I studied anthropology I took classes about the ancestry of mankind where did we come from and you know all the theories about the theory of evolution and how that we came from a chimpanzee you've all seen the graph of the of the little chimpanzee in millions of years later and finally he comes upright as a man and they call him homo sapien and they say that he came from a beast well I want you to understand that God's word says and God's word is a law it is an absolute that law has never changed and he says that every seed will bring forth of its own kind and so forth therefore when God had a seed in the beginning there's no way that that seed if it is a pumpkin it cannot bring forth a watermelon if it is a wheat seed it cannot bring forth corn do you understand there's a law and so man who was made in His image and he was a seed and where do you plant seed but in a garden and so here was this the prophet of God said it was The Missing Link and he said here was uh uh he was a serpent that's his title do not think of a writhing animal a reptile do you not think that God knows the difference between a reptile and a beast it says and he was a beast but it says it wasn't until after the fall and because and he says okay serpent because thou has done this curse it shall you be and upon thy belly thou shall crawl and thus shall be your being and our brother James Whedon had made a uh him being a great artist he took that that manly Beast that uh a missing link and he showed the the morphing of it down into a serpent and upon his belly and the prophet of God said he changed that Missing Link so much that he said it's totally hid they're trying all of the anthropologists they're trying to find where is this missing link between man and animal and brother Branham said he was a beast and he was more subtle than all the peace and the spirit of the enemy Lucifer himself could get into that Beast let me give you a Biblical teaching the demonic spirits can get into animals do you understand even when the spirits and the days of Jesus were cast out and they were cast out into pigs even the pig had enough common sense to go and kill itself rather than live with a demonic Spirit of Oppression but the spirit of God will only enter into his own kind the devil has always tried to attack that which God will produce his seed through so he attacks the church the woman I want you all to understand that a man by a lot of biologically is a giver of seed but a woman biologically now today through education and educational nonsense they say there's other kinds of genders there's only two education tries to teach you otherwise but there's only male and female and when God instituted in the beginning a marriage it was Adam and Eve it was not Adam and Steve and I want you to understand that the devil whenever you come in and break God's pattern of how life should come it brings forth death so if you were to take two males and say well we marry them and they're married do you realize their marriage is seedless it cannot therefore there'll never be another generation after that you take two females and allow them to be married and and if that's what they want but do you realize it's death do you see anything to pervert God's word to change God's word of what he wanted from the very beginning is to bring forth death and that's what Satan did to Eve he used the channel of reasoning and he just talked to her a little bit that's the problem with people today is they eat from the Tree of knowledge and by their reasoning and well it's this way and it's that way and all of these great educated excuse me idiots how that they began they cannot you know we have women's rights the metoo movement women we have our rights just give it a six or eight months later and what is the woman can't define it the Bible says and they have lost their minds they have no gender identity I'll tell you my brother my sister there's only one way to find out where you come from that's to go back to your creator because he has the blueprint he knew how to put you together if you don't know read the instructions here it is and man was made in the image of God devil always attacks the woman knowing that the woman will receive seed and we know that a woman receives a seed of a man and when that seed that is given excuse me let's take the germ of life that comes from the mail when it connects to the seed that is in the female and it takes life whatever kind of life it was that that woman embraced that pregnated that seed she will multiply it and at the time of conception at the time when the sperm of the male enters into the Egg of the female there's a biological chemistry that takes place that the egg shuts off all other life it now begins to take and shield the life that has pregnated that seed and line upon line and sell upon cell it begins to reproduce itself it has no it it does not allow any other life in Hallelujah once God has conceived you once you have truly been born again and Jesus said my words are spirit and they are life and he that heareth my words and believeth on him shall have eternal life and his past from Death unto life but once you hear The Germ of life in God's words and it comes through the hearing of the ear which is the womb to the mind and comes Beyond now you can stop you can have a spermicide by the Mind by saying I don't believe it and no matter how good that life is it'll it'll it'll stop it it'll abort the life but if it can ever if there's no unbelief you understand the the devil's spermicide is unbelief and doubt but God rich in Mercy gives to every electric and ability to receive his life his seed my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not fall off he didn't say my sheep hear my religion it didn't say my sheep hear my Pope it says my sheep hear my voice God has got a voice and let me say this because the prophet of God tells you every one of you since your conception and I'm going to take it before I'm going to take it before conception you were already if I could say this we're conceived you were a being before you were conceived in the natural womb and because you were seed and because you were in God's mind and you were already there in the womb of his mind and therefore when he began to speak and he began to create that's why every one of you have been a spoken word created being now let me say that everybody on terra firma is not seed they are seed of some kind but they are not God's seed let me tell you a mystery about God's seed a mystery about God's seed is God has been watching over that seed since the before the foundation of the world God knows his he knows his own children and so God watches over that seed so it doesn't matter where that seed comes in the the chronology of time God is going to deal with each one of you individually this is not a collective Revelation this is that if you are a sea Gene of God you can go a very long time until you come across the idea of who you really are people go to church trying to find out who they are but unless there is a revealing word that is being being preached not seeing holy prayers not lighting candles that will never tell you who you are but when you come across a minister who is God ordained God God equipped God sent and he begins to preach God's word what happens there's something because God's word is being ministered and as it's being ministered something inside of you said I never heard that before but I say something in here Beyond here something in here says amen I was a long-haired dope smoking hippie if you would have judged the book by the outward cover you would have never wasted time don't ever judge a book by its cover but one day people told me about Jesus Christ to me Jesus Christ was a cuss word when my parents got angry guess what they didn't say oh Buddha they didn't say oh Confucius oh Muhammad because the devil wants to defame the name of God my parents were not religious didn't go to church I'd always wondered why other families would go to church never not one time not Christmas not Easter oh yeah we had a Christmas tree we had Easter eggs we did everything what the world did but it was just some religious thing and but one day I met Jesus Christ that's a young boy Mitch Buckingham you guys know Mitch Buckingham from up in Flagstaff I saw him we were up there Friday had a youth meeting up there and went to service after service Mitch grabbed my arm I said Mitch it was you it was you I said you told me about Jesus thank God somebody told me about Jesus didn't tell me about church he told me he said I'm a Christian well Mitch we're all Christians we're born in America America is a Christian Nation not no more he brought me to a Bible study you all know the story well anyway during that bible study it wound up at one of those times I gave my life to God I came out from that Bible study I remember that that Minister and you know what I enjoyed by that minister he loved God he was a denominational man but he loved God and you could see it in his sincerity Hollis Allen was his name and my he loved God and there's something about genuine Christians you can tell that they are not just living the way they live because they have to I don't live this life because I have to I'm happy to live this kind of like why because I'm in love there's something about people when they're in love I came out from that Bible study having given my life to Jesus Christ they led me in a little simple sinner's prayer do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior to forgive you of all your sins and I just he said repeat after me and I did and I'll tell you what I came out of there and I I was so excited I wasn't changed I wasn't uh but there was you know what you know what was changed my heart was she I came out of there and I was so excited we were walking down the street and the power lines were above us and we got to sing in and shout and just my brother and I and Mitch and I says I feel like it'd reach up and touch the top of those power lines I'm so excited because you know the Simplicity listen do you never lose the Simplicity of what it takes to be a Christian it's not hard it's not complicated quit trying to make it complicated you've got to do this you gotta do that you're gonna see stars you're gonna have some kind no some of you it'll be just a deep feeling inside of you it'll be a pull you can't explain it some of you might scream some of you might shout and the rest of you might just sit here and go oh God thank you for the revelation of your word we all act different we all have different mannerisms we all act differently so don't expect everybody to act just exactly the way you do otherwise you're going to have it unexpected fulfillment like well man you got so excited I didn't get excited yet I I did what you did yeah here's a miracle here's the miracle you reacted didn't you yes I did then then rejoice because the Bible says he that would receive him has eternal life and any man that comes unto me I will in no wise cast out is that right we try to wash everybody up make them a cookie cutter and they got to have this and everything's they're active listen let me tell you here's the real honest truth I still ain't got all my act together God has been washing me and cleaning me up and changing me and giving me perfect love and he's helping me and you know what I'm still I am I am a work in progress I know this brother Billy you know what I love him I love him with a fervancy and the reason that I do what I do is because I'm in love not because some law not because of fire insurance I don't go to church so I can have Heaven as my home no I fell in love with him I just fell in love with him sometimes we lose our simplicity of the Simplicity that's in Christ oh do you know what it's like to know God's love do you know what it's like to have him to love you listen the greatest Force there is in the world today is love brother Graham said when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace takes over do you know the time when God revealed to you his love and how overwhelming it was to you to feel and to know that God loves me he loves me I didn't know you loved me Lord I didn't know the story of calvary I didn't know that you went to the to the cross for my sins I didn't know that in Romans 3 23 that all have sinned and he's fallen short of the glory of God I didn't know that but all I knew was that I needed God and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ wages is something you earn if you go to hell you earned your way if you go to heaven it's by grace are you safe it's not works of righteousness we lose our Simplicity that's in Christ it's not about you it's about him that's why Paul said I have espoused you to one husband and I Fearless by any means by theologians by false preachers by seducers by false prophets who come in here and preach to you another Jesus and preach to you another gospel Paul did not espouse you to the messenger he did not espouse you to a church or to the prophet but he engaged you to Christ himself God hides himself in simplicity he hides himself into intellectual from the wise and the prudent Jesus said I thank thee Father in Heaven because thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent and revealed them to babes now I've told you this before but we have some visitors here so let me say this the word babes is a compound word in Greek and he revealed it unto babes such as would learn babes napiers Napier and EOS a child that came by way of spoken word a spoken word child because the spoken word is the original seed I'm going slow let this drop in the spoken word is the Original Seed so you hid it from Weiss and prudent and revealed it to spoken word children that's why my brother my sister you can have the books and the tapes of the prophet excuse me you can have the tapes the books of the Prophet that's great that's wonderful you all should have that but unless God reveals to you what this message is all about let me tell you what it's about it's about Jesus Christ revealed in simplicity he's not three gods he's one God and he's revealed in three offices Father Son and Holy Spirit but these three are one I'm a father and I'm a son and I'm a human being those are titles of offices that I hold but that's not my name what is the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost there's only one name given among men whereby we must be saved let's let's talk about simplicity there's only one name there's only one mediator between God and man who is it it's Jesus Christ nobody what is the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost there's only one name given among men what is it Lord Jesus Christ I remember over there in Vietnam and I had a bunch of ministers all denominational ministers and we were preaching the message of the hour and I came across this doctrinal teaching thy said no one in your Bible was ever baptized in the name father son only ghost oh oh one denominational Minister stood up now he's speaking his Vietnamese I said hey this is my meeting hold your peace I said we'll talk about this later I said if you can find I said he says no no no wait a minute wait a minute I I know I find I find I find I said no you won't find it but I said so I'm not going to waste time I said you go home tonight you find me tomorrow when we have our ministers meeting find me where it was written anyone baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay he comes back the next day now now watch this sometimes the one who is the most argumentative who is the one who is the most persecuting who is like Saul even unto death because they're just religious do you see so the next morning he comes and it's so funny because we start to meeting hey hey hey me say something like this he said you right you're right no one it is and then and the guy who was the worst the hardest the most strange against us yes I will show you that's wrong what you're teaching is not right and now he said no I know it's true what is the name of father son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus Christ yes everyone in Bible baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I said okay good you got it and sit down because once God reveals to you that guess what you've got another Revelation coming again after that guess what these Revelations that are coming to you they're going to keep coming and guess what God is so great he is so infinite he is so omnipotent that guess what that throughout eternity in God's Great IMAX in heaven and you and your pillowy lazy boy chair we'll sit back and watch in God's Great Cosmos and he will begin to unfold himself and we will just sit there in our mouths will be open and our whole eyes will be wide and we'll be going wow oh that's how he did it that's simple my brother my sister the Simplicity of the Gospel the whole central theme of this Bible is that God is revealed in simplicity and that Simplicity must not be made complex it must not be preached into intellectual isms and all kinds of theological this and that no you know what saints of God when I go into other countries and I preach the gospel and and perhaps they have never known anything about the message of the hour and they have no concept do you think I tried to go up there and teach them all of the deep doctrinal things no you know what I do I start with my testimony I start about how that God got a hold of my life and changed my life and everything listen people can argue with you all day on Doctrine but they can't your testimony so tell them how your candle got lit let your light shine because you know what your testimony is the illumination that God gave to you and they may not like you they may not like your Doctrine they may not like the way you look you might be a threat to them you might bring to them some kind of guilt condemnation you don't even have to say it who do you think you are you think you're more holy than I am no I didn't say that but what happens is the spirit of God who's in me convicts their heart and they feel bad amen God is hidden in simple things I'm only impeached too I told you that this is going to evolve in the sermon Divine love let me show you a few quotes sermon Divine love God does things in such simple ways I think many times how people lose the very meaning is because God does things so simple men are looking for some great some great thing to take place when God dwells in simplicity and the next quote brother REM says God hiding himself in simplicity it is strange to think that God does such things as that God will hide himself in something so simple that'll cause the wise to miss it a million miles and then turn right back around in that some simple thing in the Simplicity is his way of working and revealing himself out again I thought he made it a text that it might study uh this before we get into the great teaching of the Seven Seals so it's important listen to this here he is I made this study before we get into the seals many times we miss him by the way he reveals himself now man has their own ideas on what God ought to be and what God is going to do and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing paragraph 28 same sermon when God is just about to do something to deliver his people God sends a message to the people and it's so simple as we'll catch in the breaking of these seals that was my purpose of bringing this first that we find out that the breaking of those seals is so simple the smart miss it a million miles so which one of you want to say well I I'm I'm a genius I'm a I'm a brain I'm an intellectual you'll miss it a million miles Lord let me let me be ignorant if you please enough to say teach me teach me thy ways o God otherwise I'll miss it a million miles do you know the prophet of God also said and this is a very good quote he said those who are susceptible to demon Spirits are highly intellectual that's why some of you will never be bothered by that I don't mean to be a put down you ought to rejoice if you're just a simple person you're going to say thank God that'll never bother me man the rest of you are highly intellectual and think a lot and everything some of you I would hate to be your brain because you think about this well what about this and how is this and why they do that and what if we do and when we get there and what is it going to be like shut up it'll never be the way you think it will be when you get there so why waste the energy we'll cross that bridge when we come to it most of the time you never come to the bridge ah the economy do I invest in gold how about silver how about Bitcoin man I'll tell you what on YouTube it's been saying all this kind of stuff if you Hey listen if you follow all of this stuff on YouTube You're Gonna Go Crazy you're gonna you're gonna try to become some hermit up on top of a hill somewhere learning how to eat cactus and be a Survivor listen I'm not I'm not here to survive I'm here to overcome I'm not surviving louder you see you I'm overcoming it guess what I ain't gonna be here I don't huh no don't don't sit there well I need to hoard up for hey it's all going to fall apart praise God all I know this I know this Elijah didn't have to figure it out when God told him to go by the book The Brook and delay and he would send Ravens to feed him huh I wonder if Elijah was so intellectual he said well what kind of Raven is it going to be hey uh where does he get the food is his beak cleaned how often is it going to bring it right I never seen that Raven before how do I know who he is I mean you know what all he did was allow God huh because he says I have commanded Ravens I don't care what happens God will command something somebody he told you he told Elijah I have commanded a widow woman no glory I've commanded a widow woman to sustain thee and guess what she's dying her and her son are dying a little bit of oil a little Cruise of oil and a little barrel of meal and Elijah had the audacity make me a cake first who Do You Think You Are can't you see them to look at us I'm gonna take this sticks and mix up this oil and we're gonna eat and die imagine their bodies were emaciated she was speaking the truth we're gonna die he said make me mine first you know what sometimes God will ask you make me mine first some of you it's hard for you to pay tithes you say well you know I get so many bills you give God your tithing first and watch him provide on the rest of that he says in one fact it's a one of the few times he says prove me here's another thing when people start having an issue in Doctrine and problems in church and they're having unbelief come in their life the first thing they use to quit is tithing that's a fact losing our simplicity Paul said I Fearless by any means that the same serpent the beguiled Eve will come in here and he will seduce your minds you know how he does it works God uses words and Satan use his words sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me are you kidding me huh I don't know why my mother taught me that because that's a lie I don't like sticks and stones and yeah they can break your bones but words really affect me and some of you are really affected by words if somebody makes fun of you huh you look like a grandma and you're only 18. it affects you if you're a follower if you're worried about what everybody thinks don't be a Christian because you know what being a Christian is not going to be popular huh in fact it's going to become more and more unpopular to the point it will cause a persecution the Bible says and they that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and we're seeing it coming on and on and on huh you can start a Satanist Club in school you can you can talk and have a club for Satan you can sing songs to Satan and you know you have your right but your children cannot quote scripture they can't take a Bible to school they can't testify about Christ oh we got it so upside down you can never have Christ Living in your life unless you're first accepted his word into your heart you will never backslide away from God until you believe a lie of the enemy you will never take off into false Doctrine until some Slicker talks you into it seducing spirits brother Brahm said I will identify what seducing Spirits are in the end time and he said they're seducing clergy that's what he said that's why in Psalms 119 wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed therein too Thy word and with all and with the whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not Wander from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee where did he hide the word his heart did you realize the most prized possession that you have the most absolutely most precious thing that you have is your heart you ever had somebody talk to you and they all of a sudden start getting all choked up and teared up and they said hey I'm talking from my heart right now and all of a sudden the eyes get teared up The Voice gets a little shaken I'm talking from my heart do you see the greatest gift that you could give God is your heart you see it's not coming to him and cleaning up the outside and getting all of your act together that's what pharisynical religion does Pharisee religion washes the outside of the cup and does nothing to the inside but true Christianity is simple Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life nobody has to tell you it happens he tells you when I had my long hair and I came to one of the tape services I'll tell you what happened I I walked by my mirror that's what I did I walked by my mirror now my mother and father my father especially is a cowboy he hated long hair on me you pervert he hated long hair they forced me to cut my hair all the way through High School so I told him I said I'll tell you what I get out okay while I'm here I'll do what you want me to do uh yeah okay but when I get out of school I'm going to grow my hair long now I'm going to do what I want you ain't gonna tell me what to do so I did grew my hair long you know my father said don't you come around my house with that long perverted hair so the first Christmas come by and I'd only had the hair had only grown out several months I thought they had long hair and it was just oh yes it was a beetle haircut he called up he said are are you coming home for Christmas I got long hair yeah well come home and see us anyway all right so if you don't love me with long hair you don't love me let me say this to all of you none of us should ever be so self-righteous that we want to make people do what we want them to do without God cleaning them up from the inside I walked by a mirror that day and I don't know what it was brother Mike I walked by a mirror and guess what I looked at my reflection I had long hair the Bible says it does not nature itself teach you that it's a shame for a man to have long hair yeah but Jesus said longer right you've heard that Jesus said longer how long is long how short is short well I got convicted I'm not going to cut my hair if God can't love me with long hair I'm telling my heavenly father the same thing I told my Earthly pot if you can't let me with long hair then you can't love me okay I'll be ashamed of my long hair but I'm not gonna cut it God knows just what to do he even fixed it enough to where he said you won't even have any hair to grow anymore I'm jealous of some of you guys you got all that long hair on top of your I mean you know this nice full head of here watch this you see the hair going I don't know why I'm saying this but what happened what happened nobody told me to cut my hair these were just a bunch of hippies just a bunch of common kids that got converted the Simplicity in Christ nobody told me but the Holy Spirit convicted me so I went and I cut my hair and I really thought I chopped it all off and I had done God a service so I walk in I happened to be late I'm very seldom ever late to anything but I walk in late the tape's already planned I walk in and everything and I I walk around I want to shake hands with everybody nobody says anything I hated it it bothered me I thought hey I went over and turned off the tape yeah David I had the audition turn off the tape hey isn't anybody gonna thank me for cutting my hair one brother said no we expected it and I'll shut up and turn the tape back on I want to ask you whose disciple was I then was I Christ because no man told me you see the Simplicity the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm afraid this lady means we lose our simplicity of God revealing himself through his word and the only Divine revealer of God's word is the Holy Spirit The Gospel is real simple I'll tell you what we should be a church that never looks down our noses at anyone else that is out there before they have a right to hear the gospel the same as you sometimes I think we get self-righteous the Bible says in Romans 8 verses 5 and 9. for they that are after The Flesh do them do mine the things of the flesh and they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death do you see that carnally minded his death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace but Conley the carnal mind is enmity with God in other words it's opposing forces huh have any of you ever played with really strong magnets huh and you get them together and if they're polarized in the right direction guess what they do man they snapped together real quick and you have to pull them apart and you play with them and back together and you all this kind of stuff you play with magnets but what if you turn it the opposite direction what happens huh they're polarized do you see that somebody with a carnal mind is polarized to the things of God I need to stop at carnally minded brother Brown said you want to win a sinner taking fishing taking fishing what's fishing got to do with the gospel well because when you're out there let your presence saints of God I I would love to have every one of you to be winners of of others to Christ because you live a life that they like the way you live and that they look at you and they see oh man this guy he's happy about what he he likes huh he enjoys it he enjoys going to church you don't have to force him to go to church you don't have to force him to be early you don't have to force him hey get in there and put on the right clothes get in there oh little sis let me tell you take that short dress off well I'll tell you that when I it wasn't because they're in love I'll tell you what saints of God the reason that I am what I am as I fell in love you want to know the real simple truth that's the reason I live the way that I do and I don't try to make others see it or do it the way that I do I wait and let God show them but I preach to you truth and I think saints of God you know what we miss great opportunities to tell somebody else about Jesus Christ and your neighbor who's been friends to you and friendly to you all the time hi how you doing Hey Ron you doing okay I'll never forget I had neighbors across the street they it was a Mexican family uh they didn't speak any English the father spoke no English and uh you know I tried to go say hello to him a couple times and hey no complaining no no habla English okay okay yeah me llamo Ronaldo mi esposa Sandra yeah yeah that's about as far as I could go no Tingo Dinero that's about all I knew so I saw watch this one day they had a whole pile maybe three tons of gravel that was dumped in the front yard and they had one wheelbarrow he had three of his young daughters his license uh played three chicas and the girls were out there and he was here he is 80 some odd years old old man gray haired and he's and the girls one by one they would take you know half a wheelbarrow and they would take it back there and everything and I'm watching and I thought ah yeah well let him do it and and I thought you know what I went got my wheelbarrow put my gloves on got my own shovel I walked across the street with my wheelbarrow put my wheelbarrow down didn't say nothing they all look at me like I watched I took my wheelbarrow I took it in the back I dumped it and I worked and I sweated and I labored and I waited until the last wheelbarrow was done what kind of a testimony did you leave they all came out the whole family including grandma came out there muchas gracias yeah sometimes it ain't what you say it's what you do it don't have to be that was that spiritual was that oh no but it was life affecting ah God why are we losing our simplicity that's in Christ why are we losing the very Simplicity of man I love going to church and I love being there and I love everybody and I've learned to shut my mouth and say only good things and quit uh huh quit talking about this one and then if there's anybody that you have to talk to about somebody else talk to Jesus brother Brandon preached a simple gospel I want to ask you I'm going to close I'm going to close here I got a couple minutes I'm only on page four that's okay I think saints of God we've tried to make this message it's simple man it is simple there is never a sermon but what I put on with brother Brenham and the whole central theme of the sermon is Jesus Christ the Apostle Paul I'm gonna I'm gonna go to this and then I'm going to close you Brethren find the quote in First Corinthians chapter two I'm going to pass up some of this stuff here while I while they find the quote First Corinthians 2 verses one through eight let me just tell you something this age is a complex age is it not huh now look I am not a mechanic and I'm not really mechanically minded but I bought a 1956 Chevrolet three-quarter ton pickup and I used to raise up the hood and you saw the battery and the engine and the radiator and that's it when I worked on that I could raise up the hood I could actually sit in the engine compartment area and work on the engine it was simple wasn't complex I bought a car the other day I raised the hood I could agree I want to change the oil can't I didn't does it have points I don't know is there a carburetor I don't know I couldn't find it to tell you anyway it's too complex so you have to take it in you buy a new car guess what you can't work on it you have to take it in why how about a cell phone I think it's complex just about the time I'm I got my flip phone to where I could get it to work properly and I knew what guess what then my kid's dad come on so I got another one it's so smart IT outsmarts me it's complex computers complex everything's complex huh even my coffee machine you got to be kidding me I I thought okay I you know I love Starbucks coffee a latte heavy cream I love it yeah come on Sandy get me one so she man we got this one press here you turn it on okay press this here got to go six seconds then one down one one thousand two one thousand two okay press okay okay uh preheating [Music] put in beans put in water or now select 20 minutes later I'm still in the process [Music] what I thought would be simple became complex now I'm going to show you First Corinthians chapter two and I want to say this in closing and again I haven't even really gone to the area of that I want to and maybe I'll close with a quote directly from Brother Branham but in First Corinthians chapter two if you want to turn in your Bibles you may foreign do you have it yeah and I brethren when I came to you came not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God but I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified wow wow wait Paul he who was caught up into the heavens he who had the greatest abundance of Revelation in his hour a man it was hard to be understood said I and determined to know only one thing I'm going to condense my whole message into one thing I know Jesus Christ wow he says I am a Pharisee of Pharisees circumcised at the Eighth Day of the tribe of Benjamin concerning the law I was blameless I am a Hebrew of Hebrews And yet when he came to Christ he said all of my former learning is done that I might know Christ have we lost our Simplicity of what this message is all about all right do you know it's easy to become a Christian it's easy you just have to give your life to Jesus Christ don't make it complex it's not hard to serve Jesus Christ musicians if you come no it's easy to be a Christian it's hard to be a sinner huh it is it's hard to be a sinner the Bible says that we have a transgressor is hard oh huh it's hard but he says to anyone that wants can come unto me if you come unto me I will in no wise cast you out wow I thought that I've got to cut my hair I've got to quit doing all of my bad stuff and I gotta be righteous enough that when I come to church he'll accept me where'd you get that he's at the well one day and there's an ill-famed woman isn't it amazing how many times he was caught around ill-famed women [Music] give me a drink it's not customary [Music] you know what kind of woman I am I have to come here at a certain time of day because I can't come with the virgins do you think that his discernment wasn't working that morning [Music] do you think that oh I made a mistake excuse me you're right woman if you knew who it was that'd ask you to give you a drink you would ask him [Music] and he would give you water that you cannot come here to get who are you you don't even have a vessel to put down how are you going to get this water if you would ask of me to give you of this water I'll give you water that you do not [Music] oh but the key word that she said was give me of this water you see how simple that was you see the Simplicity brother Gabriel if you're going to do something for God give me just just give it to me do you really want it yeah give me this water and he began to give her a well springing up with inside of her was she completely changed was she was her dress immediately all of a sudden now it was long or her hair no but he loved her I want you to understand let God love his people he will change him I told her brother yesterday I said I I bought a t-shirt to take to South Africa no to Zimbabwe it said Simon Peters fishing um Fishing Company Simon Peters Fishing Company I catch him he cleans them [Music] here I am I'm Simon Peter and I'm going fishing [Music] and you know what I do when I fish I fish for men because Jesus said come I'll make you Fishers of Men [Music] you will never catch somebody into what you want them to see until God opens their eyes and they see it and if they don't see what something that they admire or they look to they don't want it father would you allow every one of our lives to be a living example of you that we enjoy being a Christian I love it Even If Heaven is not real even if I never get a mansion even if I never walk on streets of gold [Music] I love you father and this is good enough have a relationship between you and I know you in the power of your Resurrection in the simplicity in the Simplicity that was found in Christ because when I came into Christ I found out it was the identified Christ of all the ages I found out that really that's who it's been it's been Christ it was Christ and David it was Christ in Jeremiah it was Christ and all of these what was it Christ the spirit of God when the spirit of God moves you do not need to beg people to come come to the altar sometimes I think what we do is we beg we plead we we ask come and there's a time for that there is a time for that I'm going to show you a quote that I'm going to launch off into something to help you understand maybe the direction even the prophet was trying to get us to understand something wait just a moment let me find the quote [Music] thank you in fact my wife and I were in [Music] and we were listening to a tape I find this I sent it to Brother Andy I normally don't mess up my notes like this I'm I'm overlooking it testimony on the seat thank you to your brothers find that there yeah oh my goodness oh yes Lord thank you thank you brother Andy a testimony on the scene 1962. that's the reason I've been trying to keep the message just as simple as possible wow you're keeping the messages as possible because what I'm trying to do maybe some of you might be wondering why I'm not calling prayer lines each night here's my purpose I'm doing this I want to build faith in the people in a resurrected Jesus so that you don't have to wait till some special gift passes through the neighborhood just you just believe him Wherever You Are [Music] because he's God [Music] it don't take an evangelist's hands that's all right they Place their faith the simplicity I found that that quote no wife and I I said Sandy stop I gotta go back I gotta take the tape back what was it he said he said I'm trying to keep this message so simple and why I'm not having these Fair lines and different things I want you to catch I want you to see a resurrected Jesus wow he said it's for a purpose oh God that's just giving you a little bit of a direction of what I'm going to go into in the next little bit because I'm going to go into you want a preview you want a little appetizer where I'm going what happened on the day of Pentecost [Music] the pull of what's happening again today they fail to see what God's really doing they look at the signs they look at at emotions they look at tongues and they look at all of this kind of stuff and they miss that [Music] let's Stand Together Hallelujah don't you love him this morning I tell you what if you love him why don't you give him some praise right now thank you
