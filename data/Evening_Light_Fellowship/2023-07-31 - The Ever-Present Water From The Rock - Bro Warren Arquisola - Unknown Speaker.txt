will be next week in Nogales brother Alfredo Bermudez invited me to their anniversary meetings and uh Lord willing September first week of September I will be in the Philippines I'll be back on the 25th if you remember I mentioned you one last time here that uh I will go to Pakistan and I was talking to this brother uh yam Safar and he was a good brother I did not really know that he was suffering of cancer but he never mentioned his pain he never mentioned this his uh suffering but God took him and his son uh asked me if I can pray for the family and uh they said the evangelists from their Church took over the church so I told them Lord willing I will go visit them amen the title of this message is the ever-present water from The Rock and uh the context is unyielding presence of the Lord let's read John chapter 7 30 37 the Bible said in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink amen may the Lord bless his word amen you can be seated amen the ever-present water from The Rock Jehovah is always available in times of need that's what the the song of uh the sister today that is always present amen the source of strength that never runs dry the water flowing from The Rock in the desert to quench The Thirst of the Israelites mine sometimes you hear from the advertisement that the Sprite will quench your thirst but the reality God will quench your thirst especially if you live here in the desert amen oh you long for water every day if you feel a headache you need to drink water amen unyielding presence it's an offering support comfort and companionship regardless of challenges difficulties that may arise an enduring dedication to standing by someone's side through thick or thin a powerful expression of care love and devotion that creates a sense of security and Trust in relationship between individuals and that is our Lord Jesus Christ he said I will never leave you nor forsake you until the end of the world that's his promise and I am comforted with that promise the unyielding presence of the Lord Jesus Christ you know general Douglas MacArthur there's only five uh the Army uh Generals in this world since uh in America since America uh became America there's only five star generals five five star generals and that is general Douglas MacArthur uh Omar Bradley and the former president brother uh who is that uh Eisenhower so five of them and and the uh code of uh General Douglas MacArthur here said there is no security on this Earth there is only one opportunity you know sometimes people can afford to hire a security but they suffered of a heart attack you know I remember the this family moved from California to Nebraska because they were scared of earthquake in California and they were all died because of tornado it's hard there's no security in this world but there's only one opportunity and that opportunity is to have him once you have him brothers and sisters you you're standing on the Rock of Ages amen to have him you have a comforter you have a guardian angels with you amen I always uh pray with you brother [Music] um uh Steve brother Steve is our veteran here and one day they were driving in a Iraq and the uh the the the Humvee run over uh IED and uh some of them died and brother uh Steve was wounded and you know brother Steve he always go to the hospital to check and uh we um how do you call that brother we the surgery all you have surgery all the time but you don't ask for prayer requests for you brother because you know why you know who you are you know you you suffer pain but God will take care of you amen you pray for Brother Steve pray for the brothers and sisters here that suffering you know you can see uh on the side there's a prayer Quest over there remember them in your prayers I always pray for you I've don't have uh things to give but I always remember you in our prayers amen if you need prayers you can check the my phone number is in the in the our church direct directory here um give me a call I can pray for you amen praise the Lord you know the children of Israel when they came out from Egypt God promised them that he would provide everything they had need of till they got into the Promised Land God provided their needs until they got into the Promised Land the pillar of fire was with them you know when they were in the wilderness it's so cold during the night the pillar of fire makes them warm if it's too hot during the day the pillar of cloud was following them if they were hungry God provided them manna if they were thirsty God provided them water from The Rock if they were sick God provided them a brussen serpent everything that they need was with them and this is the same thing here in this world you may not feel it sometimes you may not see it sometimes but God is with you look what God had done in your lives in our lives amen Hallelujah in Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 4. the Bible said thy remnant or Raymond walks not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell those 40 years what kind of sandals was the uh they were using it it was God's provision amen what kind of clothes brother Amos Exodus chapter 14 14. the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace don't do anything I will fight for you wherever I go wherever you go I will be with you you stand by me I will stand by you that's his promise Exodus 20 23 25 and ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of death if anyone thirsts this morning come and drink that's his uh uh that's his invitation to us Exodus 17 6 behold I will stand before thee upon the rock of in Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel my everything was there are they comfortable no they were rebellious they murmured they complained in uh the message God has provided way the prophet said notice again in this great tremendous time they run out of bread what they're going to do if God told them they was going to be Promised Land or going to the promised land it's up to God to take care of them till they get there and the Very Jehovah Jireh was right with them and then when they run out of bread Jehovah Jireh provided a way of bread all the way through the wilderness man arraigned Out of Heaven they run out of water what's the use of worrying Jehovah Jireh Lords provided sacrifice was right with them and he smote The Rock and they speak to it from then on and water come abundantly what are all their cattle thousands of gallons per second pouring out of the Rock in in a dry desert and unreasonable isn't it but God provided you don't reason how he does it how he does to do it he just does it because he said so or he would you don't need to argue with God you don't need to reason with God just believe that's our you know the song of the Prophet only believe all things are possible if the people will believe you even cancer no one can touch you and I believe that because we are believers amen why worry just just just believe and follow the Rock but did the Israelites followed it's sad because in Jeremiah chapter 2 12 13 the Bible said be astonished or ye Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate said the Lord for your people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters is that sad and you them out of cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water what is cisterns it's a it's an artificial well you know when I was in the Philippines we were poor we we don't really know what this faucet means but we we we always dig a hole and then once we dig a hole you know the there's this the water will come up or come out and then we we get water from there and we cook rice we you know make a soup from that well but the next day you need to take all the waters from there because the Tad Falls the frogs the snakes the germs will contaminate the water now you need to clean that again and again and again but God he said don't do anything I will provide you clean water the people brothers and sisters have so many inventions and they dug water I will and they keep drinking from that dirty well and that's what Jeremiah said you committed two evils my but here is what happened in the time of Samuel you know when when the when the children of Israel there was a judges for 400 years but then the people the children of Israel was not satisfied because they saw a neighboring countries as kings so they decided to come to Samuel and ask for a king but God said give them what they need they did not rejected you they rejected me Brothers don't be influenced by other mega churches their their worship they spend more time than in singing than preaching you know the popular music right now is they call that the hail song they just sing and sing and sing but they took a lot of money from the people and they don't care about if the singers is a transgender don't look don't don't watch in YouTube there the way they sing you will be disappointed because some of them has tattoos women has colored hairs that's why I thank God for musicians here that the Holy Spirit are guiding them the the the the singers and the musicians are praying before to come here in the altar so that the Holy Spirit Will flow from here to the congregation I thankful for that that we God put us into a right direction we were there before we were we were and learn to do the things of the world to the things of God but now thank God for the message of the hour amen oh the the Samuel reason with the congregation he said you know that the king will take your your young woman women the king will will take a portion of your land the king will will uh take some of you uh and make him uh his servants but they don't really care they should give us a king we want a king amen but the Lord said oh he said they rejected they did not rejected you somehow they rejected me and from this I hope and I pray that we will learn because they came out from Egypt we came out from the Catholic Revelation chapter 17. in Amos chapter 5 25 the Bible said you know these are the the children of Israel and God was talking to Amos telling to uh to the children of Israel did you offer me sacrifices and offering in the wilderness for 40 years nada oh House of Israel you also carried Chico your king and she on your idols the star of your gods which you name for yourselves but because of the rebellion of the people look at them they they were they were not thankful instead they brought gods and goddesses if they need healing God provided them some of them are lifting weights maybe we're there and this Daddy I need protein a god reigned quail my tremendous hours God was with them but instead they did not worship God they worshiped their own Gods and because of the rebellion in Numbers chapter 32 11 said surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I swear into Abraham unto Isaac another Jacob because they have not holy followed me those people from 20 and up died in the wilderness [Music] Brothers look at our message right now we are the Next Generation we are the new generations that we will enter into the Promised Land oh Brothers if I think about this you know when I accepted the message 1996 I was I was uh I I see I see my pastor was bringing bringing seven Church ages Seven Seals and the the spoken words bring it here piled up and he will read the the message put it there read the message put it there we don't we don't have this before but then most of the preaching are brother Branham uh did this brother Branham did that brother Branham but this is not the about the prophet anymore God the prophet is introducing Jesus Christ to us and now our focus is not in the prophet anymore but the message of the prophet this is the message of today that we will cross Jordan amen you know the pro the uh brother um who is that uh brother Joshua was telling me about about Israel he was there three weeks ago and he said the Jericho and the the River Jordan he said I saw the the piled up of walls of Jericho and that was the memorial that God broke the heavy stronghold of the enemy oh I believe this message brother amen my 20 and up perish in the wilderness but here look at the children of Israel the Rebellion they they were look at the the way they asked Moses all the time bring us back to the Wilderness or bring us back to Egypt they forgot that they see all the time the scars on their back the marks of the sleigh built in their hands and feet but if there's something trials bring us back we don't want to die here in the wilderness but they forgot the scars they forgot the the the the Weeping of the Egyptian soldiers to them work work work want to go back it's like heaven to me praise God I don't want to go back amen the message take the road and gather the people 1950. maybe some of those poor Israelites they left garlic and onion onions to eat Angels food and was complaining about it they had left the Muddy Waters of Egypt to drink from the Fountain of Life unbelievable but it's true paradox we're complaining about it they had left the boasting Physicians of Egypt to be with the great position and was complaining about it they left a bunch of people that believes the days of Miracles were passed to be with a bunch of people believe that all things were possible and still complaining about it isn't that just like the church today come out of Egypt come out of the world out here in this glorious Church of the Living God the firstborn and because we we little try we have little trials God asked us to believe and to hold on we still complain about it now notice another thing they had done they let the people back there that had no signs to live under the pillar of fire and cloud and was complaining about it no wonder their water supply was cut off that's what the matter with the church today there's too much grumbling about things complainings be satisfied and keep moving on passing on and when the water supply got caught up God asked them to go to speak to the Rock and it would bring forth its water my my can you see that complain complain complain that's why you cannot see Miracles here I I seen miracles in in other countries than here in America because if we need healing oh I have a insurance card I need to see the doctor if I am hungry I will open my Samsung touch screen and take yogurt plenty of food the the faith is not moving because we're countable of everything here but go to the country that day doesn't have food brother they pray hard before they eat me and brother Jerry went to the Philippines and we went there inside the the that was the Rebellion uh former uh Rebel we we don't like to go to the big city we like to go to the mountains and here there was a Believers over there and this woman she has problem her husband was sick and we went inside the brother uh me and brother Jerry went inside the house and we see the sun there was no roof and there is oh There are 16 typhoons every year in in the Philippines or more there they got a a very heavy typhoon super typhoon last week over there so this woman brother Jerry was crying he said I live in a big house in America we will do something about it and I was like waiting for Brother Jerry when we got here we asked the the pastor how much to build the house and the Pastor said six hundred dollars I called brother Jerry brother Jerry give me 300 I will spend 300. because I cannot see a Believer is the same faith fighting every day the same with you hand in hand with you they're gonna go to the Rapture if you will not go we will go together but it's sad because they live in a different countries Brothers they showed us after months they showed us a photo it was a brand new house me and brother Jerry Built six hundred dollars that's what the brother brother Ron was saying there's so many unknown missionaries that you don't even know them but they work hard to bless the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but here's Joshua the new generation one nine I commanded thee be strong and good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whatsoever or where where's you ever the ghost wherever thy goest if I will go to heaven God is in there if I go to the pits of Hell God is in there wherever thy goeth I will be with you remember I was thinking about this that when the when they were in the in the prom or in the wilderness The Rock was following them if they need Healing The Rock provided them if they need Manna God provided them if they need uh something that that uh they needed they God is our provider of their needs he's the Jehovah jira but then when Joshua crossed the Jordan River the Rocks stopped following them and then this rock where is am I fighting alone brother no because the rock became man and then here's Joshua in the midst of these trials and troubles he was Facing the Giants does according to the prophet the wall and Jericho can can raise uh how do you call that the Chariots on the top of the wall Chariot can raise how big is that brother but then in the midst of that pressure The Rock became man he said I am the captain of The Lord of hosts I will not leave you nor forsake you I will fight for you the sword was open ready to fight the battles and they destroyed the wall of Jericho see the houses even the the prophets had on the wall there was houses but there is no bigger things in the sight of God it's all the same just believe it and it will settle said amen my that's the drug that was following them and then here's the message in Corinthian chapter uh First Corinthians chapter 10 1. to four it said moreover brethren I would not that she should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pastored the sea and where all baptizing to Moses in the clouds and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the spiritual rock or spirit will drink but they drunk of that spiritual Rock and that rock followed them and that rock was Christ that rock was Christ Jesus and here in the midst of the of the Pharisees Jesus was standing there uh uh with them and then Jesus said uh and the the prophet said here in the Hebrew chapter 4 he said Moses the one that told you that he longed to see my day and he saw it in portion he said now you mean to tell us that you're greater than Moses that you see Moses and Moses has been dead 800 years said now we know that you got a devil in other words Loco crazy we know that you're crazy he said before Abraham I am The Great I Am that was in the burning bush I am the fire that was in the burning bush I am the angel that went before them he said I come from God and I go back to God and he came from God made flesh and dwelt Among Us went back to the same Pillar of Fire here he is tonight after a thousand years the same yesterday today and forever he is the same God today brothers and sisters if you believe he's the rock that follows you he's the stronghold of our faith Brothers Oh in German in John chapter 14. he said as the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless or abandoned I am with you I will come to you in a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me because I live he shall live oh ye shall live also and that day is this day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you what a comfort rock that was with them is here today brothers and sisters if you believe anything are possible hallelujah oh Brothers if I think about him it's it's the God that was following them became a man and now in the at in the last days the God that was in heaven came down and where is the Throne of God is in US that's why the message when brother Branham was was a uh uh he was a I think he was a uh uh he works in the forest preserve before and then when he was walking he saw a spring of water and then the spring of water was attracted his attention and he drink from there and when he drink from there he said I will go back the next month because it was sweet and and it's better taste than any meal any water from Costco so now he went there again and he attracted his attention because the water was sparkling and he was said why you're so jolly he asked the water it's not crazy sometimes you I act crazy but I I lost my mind when I accepted Christ 27 years ago so I'm okay I'm okay we're not Pentecostals we were Catholics when when I accepted Christ all I do is just sign up the cross and recite the the Novena but here it's a different story my I lost my mind when I accepted the message so here's the prophet was drinking and he said can you tell me Spring of water now tell me tell me um maybe because the deer drinks from you the water can say can say he said he will say no because the deer drinks for me I'm not happy I'm always happy oh um how about maybe the birds comes and drinks from you you can say nope not not because the the birds come and drink maybe because I come here and drinks from you he will say no my my my my the water is kept bubbling bubbling bubbling all the time even you don't come here and drinks from me so why are you so happy the water will say not because of you uh drinking from me it's it's something inside of me there's something pressure inside of me that comes out that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't care the trials are so heavy there's a water a Fountain of Living Water that comes out for me there's some a pressure inside of me that in the midst of Trials and testing I will praise him because he is worthy to praise [Applause] brother Chris remind went to to um in Montana about this big volcano and he said I asked him if the Old Faithful is still there he said yeah still there brother and I asked him about the pressure that comes out so one time we and my family went to to the great Old Faithful and brother you see the Fountain of water the pressure inside every 40 minutes you count it and because of the pressure Brothers it comes out every 40 minutes it's so high because of the pressure and it's the same to the Believers the pressure of God in us will bring forth praises to Him oh I don't need somebody to tell me to praise him I don't need the pastor to tell me to lift up your hands it's automatic because the pressure of God is in me Hallelujah I will quench my thirst the prophet here in the message he said here we are end timer red light down flushing coming of the Lord is at hand yes sir listen the end little message should meet and time condition there's they got off the message ought to bring back always enter message meets end time conditions see that I was thinking why we are here in this polluted age but is there's a pressure of the world in you yes but I still praise him yes heavy pressure you see all the time but I used to it because if the storms comes the eagle fly high higher than storm because your wings are created to spread and fly high oh I believe every time I go to work I listen to the podcast from our church the evening Light Fellowship podcast it's a music and every time it attracts my attention the song that the brother I think David Cleveland and all of you are very good singers but it touched my heart when I heard this song and the the the the the song said you know I asked for for healing and I got free of pain I asked for rain or a sunlight and I have rain but in the midst of it I still trust you I still trust you some people will go back because they it seems like they did not get what they expect they didn't get what they asked but in the midst of that I may not get it I may not see healing in me but I still trust him I still trust him in this old world and weary land him amen all of you are warriors here no doubt about it I salute you all amen I salute brother of all my you know when Paul and Silas when they were beaten they were they were they were in pain inside of prison you know what they did because of the pressure inside of them instead of complaining instead of crying why why why they lift up their hands and sing oh brothers and sisters it's not finish it The Same Spirit that was full and Silas is still here that in the midst of Trials and testing oh God I will trust him I heard the testimonial brother from from Venezuela this brother just went for a meeting and you know what happened the police stopped there the the the the checkpoint there was a checkpoint and then this the checkpoint uh was the the police came up and they looked for uh drugs and they found a drug in this backpack and the driver pointed that back backpack was owned by a brother and the brother said no it's not my backpack I will go to the meetings I'm a Christian but you know it's Venezuela they don't care about you so they put him to jail for five years it seems it's so hard huh but in the midst of that prison in inside the prison he shared the word of God and he started the church inside and after five years he got out and he said I want to go back to my people wherever we go I still trust you in the midst of Trials and tests you know it come out the pressure from Silas and Paul and the the pressure was so strong that it opened the prison house cause of faith I was thinking about this man he was he he just accepted Christ and it's always bubbling in his heart all the time and then the daughter said Daddy I will have a visitor tonight maybe I will I will hide the Bible and I will give him a geography book so and then the dad went went into the attic and he read the geography book once you become a Christian everything you see are Christ you go to the mountain you see Christ you go somewhere you see Christ because you are Christians your life is in Christ and then he was reading and he found out that they they cannot find the Deep of the sea it's so deep and when he put that to his sin he said so if that if the the the scientists cannot find the Deep of the sea how much more if God will put my sin in the sea of God's forgetfulness and then after that he got excited and he was running he was jumping he was screaming because of the message that he read that the sin that he had was in the sea of God's forgetfulness brother it started screaming and it started the noise was so hard and the people was so embarrassed and the daughter was so embarrassed she came up and said Daddy I didn't give you a Bible he said but what my daughter I I found that scientists cannot find the Deep of the sea I still trust you Hallelujah that's when you become a Christian everything that you Sees God hallelujah my I'm sweating I was I was reading you know when I accepted Christ I like to read the quotes poem from different you know writers but it attracted my attention to this one this one he didn't even put his name it's a known and this poem he said when he had a dream one time and on that dream God was with them and he was walking with God on the seaside but then when he had a big trials and test in this life it seems that God left him it was so sad for him and he all of the sudden he cried out to God and to ask and ask him Lord when I was a happy Christian you always with me but now in the midst of my troubles and trials where are you I saw one set of footprints only but then God replied to him and said my son if you see once at the footprints it's not you anymore because in the midst of your trials in the midst of your testing in your dark hours I will tear you I will tear you and the set of good friends that you're saying right now is not yours anymore it's my footprints it's my footprints try him God is good as the song today oh he's God will taste and see that the Lord is good as it is that he trust in God that is like a tree planted in the water oh Brothers there's as I said always there's a typhoon all the time in the Philippines foreign but I can see the tree that's still standing the Akasha I don't know how how many of you knows Akasha tree Brothers the the the the the the root of the tree brother can hold on move even into the hardest and biggest typhoon of the root how much more to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ if God say I am the Vine I am rooted you are the branches don't worry about me I am the source of everything I am the source you bear the fruit and then brothers and sisters you see from the Believers why you're so happy why why you are the happiest people of the in the world the prophet said because divine the source of the fruit the source of the substance the fibers inside your comfort that's why we have joy we have peace we have long suffering because we are rude God is rooted God can hold on in the midst of troubles and trials in the means of typhoon hurricane I still praise the Lord amen oh David one time when he was in the midst of his trials the people rejected him he was crying in the on the mountain it was sad because he was a rejected King but then in the midst of this deep depression he remembered when he was a young young man that he was sitting on the water Brooks and they started singing that's the deer panted for the water so my soul longing after you you alone Are My Strength what else brother Robert my source and I will stress and you know I may not know the the whole song but here's David he said I love for that water I long for that water when I was a young man when I was a pastor of the Sheep I I'm sitting in my trials and my test after I fought with the with the lion and the bear I can go to that water books and drink water from there and you know what these three men Warriors is cut things I forgot the three names but one of them are binaya he killed brother 300 soldiers and then here when they heard that message of David it was a longing for David but for them it was a command because the master is looking for water Brothers the monsters longing for Waters oh brother they went to the stronghold of the enemy and draw water from there they jeopardize their lives the master was longing for water and when they brought that David you know what he did instead of drinking that water because of the longing from deep within he poured out to God because he said I cannot believe that my words was a command for my soldiers you know what happened he worshiped God because he was rejected but there are people there are believers that no matter what they followed him because he was the source of life he was the source of everything David is Christ in our day now Jesus Christ when he came in John chapter 4. he was longing for water and he was the source of Life brother but why he was the one asking for water he was asking a water to the prostitute woman give me a drink give me a drink we don't fellowship with you you're racist but he said no who's talking right now to you you will ask me for a drink it's vice versa Brothers sisters you asked many times to God what did you give him as the Bible as the Bible said while ago instead of offering God Alfred sacrifices to their gods to Jehovah God Fellowship what is fellowship it's too pillow in a ship you need to give and take give and take you ask God many times how about it God will ask you give me your praises today you don't even it's so hard for you to raise up your hands to me you know you come to church I I understand you've been working for like
