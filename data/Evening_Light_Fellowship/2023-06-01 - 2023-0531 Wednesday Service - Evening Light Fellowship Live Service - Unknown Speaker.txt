of Jesus Christ I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord I miss one service and I don't know how people can go and miss two three services and be gone for a I don't I don't honestly I feel uh that I just miss one service in fact I think one of my grandkids or something said even Sandy was not there Sandy she's she's always there she I think she's the most faithful person in the church you know

for your prayers I appreciate it each and every one of you Lord willing I will be speaking this Sunday for us here at the church we also have an engagement uh that has happened uh brother Israel and sister Mariah would you guys go ahead and stand up Rory there you are stand up and I think yeah we get some photos here huh surprise but it is nice when it finally happens and and you you know you pull the trigger and decide yeah that's it and everything and and then also this past Sunday I was supposed to pray over Elias and and Ari so brother Elias sister Ari would you guys come on up here at this time what I'd like to do and I think it it behooves us as a Church of the Living God that when these couples get married excuse me when they get engaged um brother Branham says it is the promise that marries you in the eyes of God and everything and yet what it does is the two of you realize that God still holds you responsible and you treat her as a lady and as your sister and everything and your lives live clean and everything till the time that you come to the Altar and then they say you may kiss your bride and everything so anyway we love you guys we're excited for you I think this love bug has been flying around evening Life Fellowship for quite some time I think it's still flying around I get rumors that different things are happening and and uh so you have to be careful but I would like all of you to Bow your heads with me now as I lay my hands upon them put your hands together right here with mine our heavenly father Lord God I'm looking at one of my grandsons brother Elias page Father I remember when he was born I remember the joy and the happiness that we had when when he came into this uh Earthly realm father and I've watched him grow up Lord to the stature of a fine young Christian man Lord and I thank you for that and father I thank you for sister Ari Clark how that you have watched over her father and now they've seen fit that they've fallen in love one with another they promised themselves uh to each other and father we thank you for that we ask a blessing upon their lives Lord and I pray that that you will be with them Father and bless them in a very special way that that time when they come together and the marriage is completed father I pray that they will just be there and it will be such a blessing upon them knowing that if we start out right it ends right father I thank you I pray a special blessing on these two brother Elias and sister Ari I bless you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen and I want to say thank you to our brother Stephen McNeely who went ahead uh I kind of called him last minute because there on this past Sunday and I said brother Stephen you're just gonna have to take the service he said brother Ron I got it and Sandy and I were at home we streamed the service and I think he just did a tremendous job amen amen let's all stand together let's change the order of the service now amen I love being in church I love being around God's people I love to hear God's word I believe God's going to do something for somebody tonight I believe that answers are going to be given uh prayers will be answered I believe that miracles happen and I believe we ought to be expecting more and more of the supernatural to be in our midst why because where his people are there he is in their midst and he's the same yesterday today and forever let's sing that song Amazing Grace how sweet to sound that saved a wretched like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was once blind but now I see amen Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saves [Music] me [Music] I once was lost but now [Music] I see [Music] to us praise to fear and praise foreign [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise

of what you have done in this end time Lord you have turned our hearts back to the Faith of Our Pentecostal fathers and Lord not only in word but in power and in demonstration and so Lord as Believers we are expecting signs to follow us Lord because that is who we are and so Lord we ask this evening that you would come by very sweetly and that you would speak to our hearts that you would change our lives Lord that something would be said that would encourage us father whatever the need is that's Upon Our Lives we're asking in the name of Jesus that you would meet that need according to your spoken word Lord we give this service and our lives into your hands for thy Kingdom's glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord isn't God good sure he is God bless you musicians thank you so much if you have your Bibles turn with me to the second book of Samuel chapter 13. and we'll read verses one through four and I'll have you seated and then I can read the rest second Samuel chapter 13. we just welcome you all to the house of the Lord and we trust that you've come just to hear a little something a little bit of encouragement a little something to help you along life's journey because that's what the word of God does it's a help and it's a guide and he helps us and he guides us through life and so uh uh second Samuel chapter 13 verse 1 says and it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her and amnon was so vexed that he felt sick for his sister Tamar what a what a place to be in for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her notice this next little bit here it says but amnam had a friend whose name was Jonah dab and the son of shimia David's brother and Jonah DAV was a very subtle man you may be seated and he said unto him verse 4 just follow along with me why art thou being the King's son lean from day to day well thou not tell me and amnam said unto him I love Tamar my brother absalom's sister now notice the counsel that he receives from Jonah dab Jonah dab being his cousin he doesn't receive the counsel of well you know that's not right and you know you can't have your sister she's your sister you know what the word says you know this you know that but instead rather listen to the counsel that jonadab gives on to him and Jonah dab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to thee say unto him I pray they let my sister Tamar kamban give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her hand so Adam laid down and made himself sick it wasn't very hard for amnam to make himself sick because he was already sick with this vexation within his spirit that he loved a girl he should not have so amnam laid down and made himself sick and when the King was come to see him amnam said unto the king uh I pray thee let Tamar come and verse 7 it says and David sent home to Tamar saying go now to thy Brother amnam's house and dress him meat so Tamar went to her brother amnam's house and he was laid down and she took flower and needed it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnam said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him and admin said unto Timar bring the meat into the chamber that I may eat of thine hand and Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to add them her brother and when she had brought them onto him to eat he took hold of her and said onto onto her come lie with me my sister and she answered him name my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in Israel do not doubt this Folly and I wither shall I cause my shame to go and as for thee Thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel now therefore I pray thee speak unto thee King for he will not withhold me from thee how be it he would not hearken onto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her and I'm amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred were with he hated her was greater than the love or with he had loved her and amnam said unto her arise be gone see that's what Satan wants to do with each and every one of us whenever he gets what he wants whenever he has his way with us in our lives there's no love there get up and get out of here then he called his servant that ministered onto him and said put now this woman out from me and Bolt the door after her and she had a garment of divers colors upon her for with such robes for the King's Daughters that were virgins apparel then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her and Tamar pradash is on her head and rent her garments of diverse colors that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying and Absalom her brother said unto her hath amnam thy brother Ben with thee behold thou but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so Tamar remained desolate in the in her brother absalom's house but when the king did when the when King David heard of all these things he was very Ross and Absalom spake on to his brother Amna neither good nor bad for Absalom hated abnam because he had forced his sister Tamar what a portion of scripture a very sobering thought and many lessons that we as uh children of God can learn from this passage of scripture and I would like to title my sermon tonight amnon had a friend it was found there in verse two or three whatever it was amnon had a friend now we find that amnon was the first son of David and being that he was the firstborn no doubt he was very loved by David himself and David would realize and amnon himself as he would grow that the inheritance of David would now pass on to amnon because he was the firstborn son and The Inheritance would belong unto him and when amlam was born to David David was not yet King over Israel but we know that there would come a time that David would be king over Israel and therefore because he was King his firstborn son then would be the next in line to take over the kingdom in Deuteronomy chapter 21 verses 15 through 17. it says if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have borne him children both the Beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he has that he may not make the son of the Beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn so what the scripture is trying to tell us is whether one's hated or one's love that has nothing to do with it the inheritance is going to go to the firstborn son but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his so we find out that the firstborn son within a family it was given on to them it was their right because they were the firstborn son within the family that a double portion of the inheritance should be given onto that son whether the wife was loved whether the wife was hated whether the son was loved or this son was hated it did not matter because according to the law unto the word of God it was his right to receive the inheritance now we find out that as Sons and Daughters of God now I'm gonna just preach a little bit of happiness here because I can sense the tension you guys are wondering where is he going with this portion of scriptures we are going directly to the heart Hallelujah very interesting when I tried to look up what brother Branham said about Tamar and about amnam he never once mentions their name and I thought my goodness I need a little bit of something a little bit of prophetic Insight here to help me along the way this evening but uh but that's okay so we find out that as first born Sons and Daughters of God that there is an inheritance that is promised to us as first born children now brother Branham would say that God has no grandchildren God has no second born or third born children he only has firstborn children Sons and Daughters of God and because we are firstborn now we can take the word of God and we can say because I am a firstborn son or daughter of God that everything that is written within this word is mine of my inheritance it belongs to me it is mine my name is written all over it therefore I can claim any promise that's written in this word according to me whatever the need is whatever the situation is I can reach out by faith because I realize who I am and when you realize who you are and you realize the inheritance that God has given on to you all things become possible now you might say well I'm a I'm a I'm a girl or I'm a woman does that mean because I'm not a son that I'm not a firstborn the Bible says that there's neither male nor female but we are all in Christ and if you want to break it down even further God has given to us an inheritance as a woman through our Union to Christ therefore everything that's his is mine it leads nobody out it's not just for the man it's not just for the boys but it's for the man the women the boys and the girls it's for whoever has a strong hand of faith that can reach out and take the word of God and claim these promises now notice in that scripture when it's talking about the inheritance it talks about a double portion and I thought this was very interesting uh listen to what brother Branham talks about the double portion here in the way of a true prophet of God 1962. brother Branham says and then he give us all things now we have the earnest of our inheritance now listen close and I ain't preaching on that subject but it just feels good to me right now see that we have the inheritance of that for one day we walked in sin and after being baptized in his name and raised with him in Resurrection we've been brought out of sin never no more to want to go back again and we can all say Amen to that if you've truly been delivered from sin and the bondage that sin brings you can truly say I never want to go back to that life that I once lived he says we're raised from sin but the evidence that we have we're potentially in the resurrection from from all deaths see if we could raise up from sin by faith in him and there is sin who would want to go back to the garbage cans of sin again see we've passed from Death To Life see that's the earnest amen that's the earnest of the complete Resurrection all death physically and spiritually we don't overcome spiritual death because we passed from Death on to life and as Elijah went down to Jordan one day instructed with Elisha and it parted back and he crossed over he come back with the double portion and when we strike Jordan with Christ we got one portion but when we return we're coming with two portions we got eternal life Resurrection from sin now and righteousness with the Holy Ghost and then on the return with Christ we come back with both physical resurrection and we already got spiritual Resurrection we have a double portion of it always a type of Christ in the church Elisha and Elijah and so we can see that Elijah and the church are Elisha and the church it's it's it's a type and we don't have to look very far to see if there's been a double portion that's been poured out on this day all you got to see is the Miracles and the lives and the different things that have been changed and the ministry of the messenger of this hour we can say that we are uh fruits of the ministry of Malachi 4. we are fruits of the ministry of Revelations 10 7 and we can see that there has already been a double portion poured out on the bride of Christ but there will be another double portion because we have a part of it now but when we come back with him on the earth like brother Branham said there's another portion both physically and spiritually now something to notice about amnam it's very interesting when you kind of look at his life and it kind of parallels almost a message believer we find out that amnam was of the Seed of Abraham and Not only was he of the seat of Abraham but amnam was also of a royal seed now put your spiritual thinking caps on because when I talk about amnam throughout the service I want you to put your own name there as a Believer as a believer of the royal Seed of Abraham so when I talk about Adam and I talk about his struggles I'm talking about a believer in this day so we find out that because of the family that amnam was raised in or because of the family that amnam was born in immediately it brought a pressure on his life because he was the son of a king and because he was the son of a king it would automatically mean that amnam would have to live his life in a certain way there was a certain pressure on amnam that he would have to perform on a daily basis there was a certain pressure on amnam that before the people he would have to seem like he was living a perfect life because of amnam was struggling it was a sign that the kingdom that the king of Israel was also struggling if Anthem was having a hard time it would be a reflection upon his father David and so we find out that because he was of royalty and everybody looked at the family of David as royalty we find out that there was this I'll just continue to say pressure there was this burden that was placed upon his life it wasn't something that he desired on his own but it was a pressure that was put on his family and those that were around him it was a pressure that was put on him by the people of Israel that expected him to be perfect a man who was born in sin shaped in iniquity a man who perhaps only had his father around the house once in a while a man that perhaps his mother was the main one that was raising him because his dad was out busy doing other things and here this man was expected to be perfect in all his ways here this man was expected to be of of of of absolutely no fault or no failure because if he had a fault or a failure it was a reflection of his uh his royal family what about you as a believer what about you amnam I'll be the evening Light Fellowship do you feel the pressure of being a message believer do you feel the pressure of being raised in a message family with a standard that has to follow a family do you feel the pressure of having to live far above expectations of how old you are isn't it amazing how that whenever uh uh uh little kids as soon as they they turned to an age of where they can where they can talk and walk around and everything that we expect them to be absolutely perfect we expect them not to answer back we expect this out of them we expect that out of them why because we're message believers we're not no denominational Believers there's nothing that just goes within our household we have a standard that we have to hold and you're going to toe the line and it all it's all a part of being a message believer because God does hold us to a higher standard and God does hold us and put a burden upon us because of the family that we are born in and he does expect us to toe the line but it's a pressure and it's a burden sometimes that a lot of people can't handle let me say this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives there is absolutely no way for us to toe the line of God's word but it takes an experience with God that when we have an experience with God you don't have to try to do nothing because the life that lays within us now begins to show forth of what it is brother Branham says a sheep doesn't try to Bear wool he doesn't have to manufacture wool he just Bears it that's the difference that's the difference in an experience with God you don't have to try to do anything it just happens so it's very interesting as we as we look at the life of amnam we find that in his life that those things on the outside seem to be going well he was the son of a king and he had everything that he could have ever dreamed of but yet within the heart of amnam there was sin yet within the heart of Anthem there was something that wasn't quite right there was something within him that that that he was actually hiding from the people it was something that he wasn't making known to everybody because he realized that the sin this thought this desire this vexation that I have within me is not normal I shouldn't have it it shouldn't be there because we read in the first couple of verses that he found it hard to do anything to her he knew within himself this thought that I have this desire that I'm hiding from my family this desire that I'm hiding from my friends this desire that I'm hiding from all of Israel I know it shouldn't be there otherwise he would have committed to sin a long time ago but yet he was holding it deep within and it so vexed his spirit that he became sick when you try to hide sin in your life you're going to become sick it was something that he hid very well just like a message believer we can come to church we know how to dress we know how to act we know to come to church 30 minutes early we know the pair ties we know the right things to say and when to say them but I wonder is there any amnames within the assembly this evening that there's a vexation within your spirit there's a vexation within your heart because there's a secret sin laying within there that nobody else knows about and you hide it deep within because you're ashamed to share it with anybody because there's there's an image there was an image that Adam had to keep there was a there was a certain way that he had to look before the people and he could never let it down and if he ever happened to share it with somebody and perhaps it would get out it would absolutely ruin his whole life it would ruin his own image it would ruin everything about him nobody would ever look at him the same again so it is with believers we're ashamed what other people are going to think we're ashamed to share our faults we're ashamed to share our failures because we have this facade that because I'm a message believer I have to be perfect that because I'm a message believer I have to have this image before the people that nothing ever gets me down I never get in any trouble I never have any sin in my life I never have any trials or tribulations everything is perfect what a lie what a lie because we all have faults and we all have failures and we all have things that we struggle with in our lives but because we're so worried about our image because we're so worried about what other people are going to think we hide it deep within and we hide it so well that no one else can notice it until it's too late you might be able to hide what's laying within your heart now but give it time give it time because that life that is within there is going to make manifest at some time in our lives but we try to hide it because I'm ashamed I'm ashamed of my sin I'm ashamed of my feelings I'm ashamed of what's going on in my own private life and how in the world could I share it with anybody else how can I ask for help it's a vexation within my spirit it's a vexation within my heart and I'm sick mistake number one people think the message Believers have to be perfect I've got a lot of nonsense we ain't perfect fault number two is that we tried to hide it for too long and when you hide it for long enough all of a sudden we implode from within and nobody notices it on the outside until it's too late well why didn't you tell me I could have helped you because there's an image that we have to keep saints of God throw down whatever image you think you have whatever facade you think follows you or or whoever you think you are you gotta drop it because if you don't drop it and ask for help it's going to be too late but the moment that we swallow our pride the moment that we put our pride to the side and we say you know what I'm having a hard time things aren't going right in my own personal life and I need a touch from God the moment that you begin to ask for help you know what it does it holds you accountable to that person so now that person because you're the one that reached out that person now can reach out to you and say is everything okay that situation that you told me about are you taking care of it or are you still living and the way that you told me you were living in but if you don't say anything you don't hold yourself accountable to anybody and that is a dangerous place to be in the devil wants to get you so low and so sinking and sin that he makes you doubt the experience that you had with God well I didn't have no experience with God I guess it wasn't real and how can I be living this secret life and how can I be having these desires Within Myself have I had an experience with God that's where the devil wants to get you too and he wants to keep you there because he wants to keep you in a defeated State he wants to keep you in a state where you feel like you'll never overcome the situation but the good thing is is that once you begin to realize on how to overcome a situation when more situations come because they will come you'll learn how to overcome the next one and you'll learn how to deal with the next one that's the importance of staying in fellowship with God because once you get out of fellowship with God you're defeated but when we stay in fellowship with God and we focus upon his word it just means that when the trials of Life come we have our focus on the right thing Hallelujah they told my mom there uh last week or whatever it was they they narrowed this thing down these symptoms that she's been having and everything to um what's that word psoriasis cirrhosis I can never remember the word cirrhosis of the liver so there was three there was three doctors that told her you have cancer and there's cancer in your blood and we don't know where it is and so now six months later they're doing more tests and they can't find any cancer so rather than my mom being excited they told her well sixty percent of your liver is not working and 40 percent of your liver is working so rather than taking well I don't have cancer and 40 percent of my liver is working will praise God it's almost half of it it all depends on how you look at the situation so I have to remind my Mom hey God has brought you this far I believe he's going to take you even further why can I speak like that because I'm in fellowship with God and I see the promises that's written within his word therefore I can encourage those around me of those same promises so those things may have appeared on the outward very well for around them yet within his life and his own personal life he had a vexation that he couldn't handle first two it says of Samuel 13 and amnam was so vexed he just wasn't vexed he was so vexed within himself he felt sick for his sister for she was a virgin and amnam thought it hard for him to do anything to her and them knew that his desire was not right he knew that whatever thoughts that was going through his mind he he knew that it wasn't aligning with the word of God he knew within himself that that kind of thought and that kind of desire it it shouldn't have been amongst the royalty family of God it shouldn't have been there and so he fought it and he said the Bible said that it was hard for him to do anything to her why was it so hard for him because he knew it was wrong how many of you have ever been in that place where you absolutely know what's wrong I know I know I know it but I can't contain myself I just can't handle it I I can't overcome it therefore I have to give in God help us he was so vexed within himself because he was covering it up he was so vexed within himself because he was hiding it and he was imploding from within understand you can't hide anything from God it's very interesting when you look up the name of amnam and his the meaning of his name it means faithful and I thought how interesting is this how can his name mean faithful but yet he has a secret sin in his life it doesn't really make sense but the more I thought about it the more I realized that his outward adoring adorning was faithful he was faithful to his family he was faithful to the crown he was faithful to God and the outward appearance but he wasn't being faithful within himself he was a people pleaser that's the matter with some of you you care too much about what people think because you want to please because you want everybody else to think that you're doing right and there's nothing wrong in your life amnam don't hide it because it's going to become a vexation in your spirit and make you sick told you we were going to speak to the heart message Believers are so good at hiding things these days because we're so worried about what everybody else thinks so worried about our image or so worried about this and we're so worried about that when really we're not worried about what's going on within and how to fix it we can only get so far on the adorning of the outward appearance we can only get so far with being faithful to the exterior things but at a certain time and at a certain season the inward man is going to catch up and before we know it everybody will know the secret that is laying within our hearts that we've been covering up for so long why not just take care of it why not just take it for what it is and ask for help why not just say this is where I'm having a really great issue I need help because if I don't get help I'm going to sink mayday mayday mayday we're sinking the ship is sinking if you never cry Mayday no one's ever going to come to your help but if you cry out for help there's no better place to ask for help than a church there's no better people to ask for help than the Bride of Jesus Christ there's nobody else better to ask for help than your pastor there's nobody better to ask for help help me I'm drowning and I am fixed we'll notice the further that you read about his life that he was so vexed and he didn't deal with it that it didn't only affect his life but it affected Tamar it affected Absalom it affected David it affected those of his Gatekeepers who could who kept the secret it affects everybody all because they wouldn't deal with the issue my brother my sister humble yourselves before God humble yourselves and he'll lift you up humble yourselves and ask for help let me speak to your hearts you say well I'm not there today brother Stephen perhaps someday you will be there will be a time when you're going to need help don't be scared to ask for it James chapter 1 verses 13 through 15. let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust is conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death the Bible it says that when a man is uh it says when every man is tempted he is drawn away what is he drawn away from when he is tempted he is drawn away from the word of God he is drawn away from his relationship with Jesus Christ he's drawn away from reading and praying and spending a a personal time with God himself why is he drawn away from these things because he's drawn away of his own lusts it's very interesting when you look at the word lust we find out that the word lust it means a desire a craving or a longing especially for what is forbidden so what is it that's within us that is lusting and Desiring and craving for these forbidden things it's your carnal man it's your carnal nature so first of all we have this lust this craving this desire and understand people think about they think about a man lusting towards a woman but the word lust is not only uh implicated towards for a man to a woman but it's towards anything that is forbidden Eve's lust was full it wasn't for some forbidden fruit but it was it was for uh for her own reasoning that she might know good from Evil and she might be as a God that was her desire that was her longing and when the devil gave her that that uh that that forbidden fruit if you say the craving he he absolutely satisfied her for what she was craving and had brought sin into her life understand whatever this flesh man this guy here whatever he craves on a daily basis Satan's gonna give it to you if you just open up your spirit if you just open up your mind in your heart and you say oh I just really wish that I could have this Satan will give you the Cravings of your carnal man what does he do he entices us we're drawn away by our own cravings and our own desires but because of that now we are enticed so what does the word entice mean the word enticed means to catch by bait to Allure are to beguile so what Satan does now he uses your longings your desires the things that this carnal man is craving after and he uses it as a bait and he puts it out there for every one of us to take that when we take the bait guess what we're captured why because we've been drawn away our Focus has been taken off the word of God and we've been drawn away in our Focus now is towards worldly things ever wonder why you can't overcome because you're focusing on the wrong things so we're drawn away from the word we're drawn away from the street and narrow Way by a desire or a craving that we have within our carnal man for those things which are forbidden for the Christian to partake of for the Christian he said well what's forbidden to me as a Christian read your Bible you don't have to wait for the preacher to tell you read the word let the Holy Ghost speak to our hearts and say my this craving in this desire I have is not according to a son or a daughter of God God help me so what happens when we're enticed and we're we take the bait per se when we take the bait and we eat of that which is forbidden it brings forth sin and When sin is in our life it brings forth death not only will it bring forth a spiritual death in our lives right now but it'll bring forth death because if we go against if we bring uh what is it have we bring if if we ruin the testimony of Jesus Christ as Believers this is paraphrasing it brother Branham said that God will take us off the scene why because we're bringing a reproach to the word and to the name of Christ so not only does it bring forth a spiritual death right here right now but it'll bring forth a physical death why because we're drawn away from the word by our own lust and enticed it's exactly what happened to amnon the thought was in his mind for Lord knows how long it was in his heart but he knew enough not to partake he knew enough not to chase after it he knew enough to know that it was wrong but I'm them had a friend Adam had a friend I wonder how many people if you were to ask them well when did you start smoking well I had a friend in school when did you start doing pot well I had a friend at school when did you start going off the deep end well I had a friend and you could call that friend by name choose your friends wisely I don't care how old you are I don't care how young you are but friends are an important factor in our lives show me your friends and husband said and I'll show you your future but on them had one of these friends I kind of feel sorry for him a little bit because he was so miserable within his Spirit he was probably miserable in church but he was miserable in the world he was miserable everywhere he went because of the sin that was in his life and the one time that he opens up to somebody the one time that he opens up to a family member his cousin Jonah dab guess what happens expecting the right kind of counsel he tells them everything that his flesh man wanted to hear I ain't no friend that ain't nobody that you want to have that you want to share things with somebody that's going to give you the wrong kind of counsel but that's the kind of friends that he associated with hey I got a plan and this is good and you're going to like it he's going to pretend to be sick and you're going to do these things and your dad yeah he's going to believe you and he and he's going to think you're sick and he has absolutely no idea when she comes in this is what you're going to do what up a dirty dog huh that's an Irish expression I don't know if you say that here Dirty Dog huh here he was he's supposed to be this guy's friend here he is he's supposed to be family with this guy but he tells him everything that is flesh man wants to hear brother James loveball has said it time and time again from the pulpit brother Ron don't tell me what I want to hear tell me what I need to hear that's what a true friend does and that's what a true friend expects out of their friends tell me the truth tell me where I'm going wrong tell me when I'm going to make the wrong choice so I don't go down that road don't just tickle my ears and tell me what I want to hear God give us more friends like that give us more people with an attitude like that that when they come for counsel brother Ron has said it he goes a lot of times people will come for counsel already with their minds made up I've had it myself I've had somebody come and unless you tell them exactly what they want to hear they say well your counsel is not good give a counsel to somebody one time did not like it um told him straight straight into the point wasn't rude straight as a friend should friendship really wasn't the same after that for a while which is fine I felt okay it was on him his problem was I didn't tell him what he wanted to hear two years later he came and he told me you remember when you told me such and such in the car yes sir I do I hated every word of it but it was the truth took him two years to get over it but he got over it so it happens people only want to receive counsel when it's what they want to hear but if we would come with an open mind if we would come with a sincere heart and if we would come with not our already our minds made up now God can use the gift God can anoint the gift and give you the counsel that you need to receive but you've got to be open and willing to receive the counsel otherwise it'll do you no good you know the word of God the Eternal Word of God can do you absolutely no good unless you let it zero because it'll just be words it'll just be something that goes in one ear and out the other but when you let the word of God have an effect in your life and you say Lord that's done Lord that hurt but it is your word and I accept it guess what will happen the word of God will have an effect on your daily life but you've got to let it got to let God have his way God's not going to take his way in your life but you've got to let him have his way because he's a gentleman God don't take anything from us but he expects us to give it to him and when we give our hearts to him that's when he can really move on our lives Hallelujah but you've got to let it you've got to let the gift have its way in your life you've got to let the word have its way in your life because if you don't let it if you don't listen to the council if you come with a closed mind already it can do nothing for you what a lesson we can learn from this that if we'll approach the right way and if we approach the gift in the right way I believe that God will be obligated to give you the answer that you need not the answer that you want amen so amnam he had this friend huh and you know it's kind of interesting it's a friend that each and every one of you have and it's a friend that you know very well and his name his spiritual name is called amnam amen how can we learn from these things she's your friends wisely and choose who you counsel with wisely the person first be proved that they're a a good listener and they know to keep their mouths shut then Reach Out Hallelujah Amos chapter 3 verse 3 can two walk together except they be agreed First Corinthians 15 and 33 be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners each of us have two friends in our lives we have a friend spiritual on them and he lives a lot closer with you than what you think it's not a friend of the flesh at least I hope you don't have a friend of the flesh let down them but you have a friend of your flesh who's called amnam and on a daily basis he's telling you the wrong things to say he's telling you the wrong places to go he's given you the wrong thoughts within your mind and he is agreeing with absolutely everything that your flesh man desires that is contrary to the word of God and that is your flesh carnal man he is the one that speaks to your mind he is the one that gives you these desires these Earthly desires and Pleasures that you think you really really really want he is the friend that you need to be careful of he is the friend that'll get you into trouble but he'll never get you out of trouble we'll read that about Jonah dapp I'll just say it it's kind of interesting with Jonah Dell so the whole thing happens and two years later Absalom says nothing to his brother he has a hatred for him I hate him so much that I won't say anything good to him and I won't say anything bad to him but I will get my vengeance and so we realized that two years later Absalom goes to David his father and he says let us all get together I want to get everybody together and and this and that and he says well and and Absalom absolutely presses his father because his father David says well what if something happens and All My Sons be slain oh nothing's gonna happen dad just just let us all go we know the story that Absalom had his servants whenever amnam's heart was married with wine thought he was in a good place thought he'd gotten away with it there was no real correction from David he thought he was in a place where hey everything's good I got my way with Tamar she's living in absalom's house I'd never see her nobody ever sees her it's it's not even there it didn't even happen but Absalom didn't forget Absalom had him slew had him murdered so because of the the the Council of jonadab to amnam he caught he absolutely ruined Tamar's life she was alone in her brother's house probably until the day she died because of the shame of what happened she could no longer longer wear her her her cloak of being a virgin with pride but it was rent because he had taken something from her that she should have give to somebody does that make sense it's so sacred that it should never be taken but it should be freely given by love from a girl but it was taken from her and it was something that she could never get back there was something that she was marred with for the rest of her life why because of the choice of a man and because of the counsel of another man turned Absalom into a murderer amnam was a rapist it can go on and on why because of the bad counsel of a friend but I am them had a friend and we realized that whenever word had come back to David David thought oh my all my children are dead and honey begins to cry and who was right there beside David his nephew let's just read it because it's very very interesting uh verses 32-33 and Jonah dabbed the sum of uh shimmy uh David's brother answered and said let not my Lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's Sons for amnam only as dead it's kind of how I read it it's only amnam it's only it's not all your sons that's only him but wait a second I thought you were his friend that's only Adam don't worry King listen what he says for Adam only is dead for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister taymore he didn't sell I was the one that told him to do it he puts all the blame on Absalom are on on amnam he didn't say it was my counsel that made him do this it was it was it was kind of my fault and I'm so sorry I'm the one that caused all this he says since he did that to Tamar guess what he deserved this from that day forth it's okay what a friend it could care less verse 33 now therefore let not my Lord the king Take the thing to his heart to think that all the king's sons are dead for amnam only as dead he could care less this is the guy that you deal with on a daily basis this is the guy that says he's your friend but yet he could care less he could care less about your spiritual life with God he could care less about your spiritual temperature and how you're doing at church and how you're doing in your family life and how you're he could care less all he cares about is one thing and that's partaking of those things which are forbidden but you also have another friend you have a friend who sticks closer than a brother you have a friend who said I will never leave Thee the normal I ever forsake thee but I'll always be with thee it isn't just some some figure or some man but it's God himself the creator of heavens and earth he is the one that promised it and he is the one that is fulfilling his word in our lives as the musicians come so all of you realize including myself and I'm very aware of it did I have two friends in my life two spiritual people and one is trying to get me to do good and the other one is trying to get me to do evil these are friends that perhaps you don't have any choice well you do with the Lord I suppose well really you don't because you're predestined to it but you still have to make a choice you have these two friends in your lives and they're a completely opposite one to another but there's one thing that we can do as believers now we can make a choice of who we're listening to the choice is yours and that's the battle that's the war that rages within our members that whenever I want to do good evil is with me and and whenever I want to do this and that I don't want to the things that I don't want to do those are the things that I do and I'm just a reservable miserable Wretched Man and but I'm just so vexed at myself but understand you have a choice of who you're going to listen to now let me ask the question who are you listening to what friend are you listening to the most because the friend that you listen to the most on a daily basis is going to be your better friend the friend that you stay in contact with on a daily basis he's going to be the one that you're closer to the one that you have fellowship with day and night the one that you call up on the phone and you talk to them for a while the one that you talk to hey guess what he's going to be your closest friend so who do you spend the most time with who have you been yielding your members to the most is it Jonah down is it this guy that that wants to put everything before your face that's for forbidden who knows the Cravings he knows the things that makes you tick who knows the things that you enjoy in your life that's going to take you away from God are you more friendly with the one who wants to be your friend in the good times and in the bad times the one who wants to be your friend whether you're living good or you're living bad the one who wants to be your friend that whether you've got a lot of money or you're broke because he's not after your material things but he's after you because of your character and he loves you because of who you are quite a sobering thought because we realize that our friends are the ones that influence us the most whether good or whether bad [Music] and so your life and my life right at this very moment as a Telltale sign of who our best friend is because it's influencing our lives in one way or another and perhaps you're saying this evening my goodness thanks I got this issue in my life like this and I'm not and hey guess what you don't gotta listen to Jordan you don't gotta listen to everything that he tries to put in your mind but rather you can keep your focus on God and when Jonah dab is here and he's talking and he's talking he's never gonna shut up until you focus on the other person then this is just noise so saints of God God help us to take a real inventory in our lives [Music] starting from the pulpit the whole way to the back of the church maybe look at ourselves and say yeah it's true it's true I'm not perfect and it's true I have faults in my life and it's true that I have a Jonah dab but it's also true that I got this other one in my life who wants nothing but what's best for me [Music] it's kind of a no-brainer so how about this evening you choose the way of the Lord you choose the way with the Lord's despised few no matter what your image says or no matter what any about that other stuff choose this day who you're going to serve and not just serve with a half-hearted heart but serve holy and serve fully with a
