I greet you all this morning in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Today is going to be a little bit of a different service. And so I want all of you to kind of bear with me. Um and and so we have a few other things that we'll do here prior to us going directly to the word. And um so uh the last couple weeks now we've had a wedding each week and uh so I wanted to show you a couple pictures because some of you let's show um brother Noah and sister Clarissa. Yeah. Uh they were married last week and they have moved to Holland and sent me the note that they have arrived safely and in their new home and and so they're we pray that they'll live happily ever after. Amen. Amen. Then the next is uh we had one yesterday. Brother Alexis and sister Grace got got married and uh so uh we had the wedding here yesterday and it was quite nice. And uh we were getting ready I wanted to say and give them the Bible and and say goodbye to them and we went out to the parking lot and as I was out in the parking lot um they had not left and he had a I think a Corvette or something that they were going to drive away in and uh he started that thing up I jumped. My goodness. That because it was so what in the world. Anyway, uh after you have weddings, if there is a union that takes place and it is fruitful, it brings forth children. See, God expects you to bring forth fruit &gt;&gt; if you've had a union with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does expect fruit. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh we have uh this morning here a baby dedication. Actually, we have two dedications this morning. So I'm going to read from Matthew chapter 19 and then we'll sing the song and and uh we'll have brother Andrew Kennedy and Sister Anessa to come. It says here in Matthew chapter 19:13-15. Then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, "Suffer, little children, forbid them not to come unto me, for such is the kingdom of heaven." And he laid his hands on them and departed then. Amen. Let's sing that song. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. Amen. Amen. Come on up here, brother Andrew and Sister Anessa. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yeah. Look at this. Oh my brother Andrew, God has given you and sister Anessa another love gift because of a fruitful union. And in the days of Christ, they wanted to bring the little children See how important it is not only that you name your child properly, but you bring and you dedicate them because you know what? We need help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need help in raising our children, especially in this age. And so the very best thing you can do is to bring them and dedicate them to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so that's what we'll be doing here. And they have named their little son Cyrus. Revan. Is that how you say it? Revan. Cyrus. Revan. And Cyrus means heir to the throne. Wow. This is good. And it even gets better. And they said that biblically Cyrus as you know was uh called Cyrus the Great divinely appointed as a ruler who allowed the Jewish exiles to return home. So this Cyrus is on a journey going to return home also. Amen. And revan means to celebrate or to rejoice in in Hebrew, but in French it means to return or to come back. In Irish it means kingly. So may all of these meanings reflect the son's little character. &gt;&gt; May he be heir to the throne. And may he celebrate and rejoice in his return. &gt;&gt; All right, turning the other way. There we go. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Oh, he's all dressed up with a bow tie here. Everything. His little shoes on. He looks quite healthy. He's heavy. He's how many pound? 12 pounds already. Oh my. Praise the Lord. Just come over a little closer if you would. Right here. I would like all of you to bow your heads now if you would. Heavenly Father, I hold in my arms this little love gift that you have given to brother Andrew and sister Anessa. You have placed this little son into their family. And therefore, there's a great responsibility now for this family to raise this child in the nurture and admonition of God. I pray, oh heavenly father, that you will allow Cyrus to become heir to the throne and may he rejoice forever because he's returning back to where he come from. &gt;&gt; I pray heavenly father that you will bless him all the days of his life, oh God, because you said that you have watched over us from our birth until the time we go home. So I pray that you will watch over his uh his feet where they go, his eyes what they see, and his ears what they hear. May he be part of that bridal company at the end time, Lord, that will be ready at your coming. Father, I bless Cyrus, Reverend now back to you for a life of service. Bless this family now with this son in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. He's a cutie. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you. Yeah. God bless you, too. Yeah. Yeah. I got a blessing from there. Amen. And brother Martin Malumba and Sister Grace have got a little son they want to bring now. So if they would come at this time, let's sing that song once again. Yes. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. Amen. God bless you, brother Martin. Sister Grace, God bless you richly. So God has given you a little son. &gt;&gt; Look at that smile. And they have named him Daniel Kabika Malumba. And they've given me the definitions of all three names. Daniel means God is my judge or a judge of God. Kabua means one who forgives or one who is forgiven. Not only who forgives but one who is forgiven because it's upon condition if you forgive others. Amen. And malumba means he who gathers for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Wow. This boy has already come into this world judged of God &gt;&gt; to be forgiven &gt;&gt; so he could gather together for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Wow. That that that's powerful. I don't know about you, but that that is powerful. I appreciate it. So we are so thankful that God gives to us love gifts and then he requires us as parents that we raise our children in the admonition and nurture of God. Teach him his ways. Show them. Show him how much that you love him. because you must lead by example. We don't want to say we love God and then live differently. But we want to show our life and how much that we love God and that we're happy in doing it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Happy are you if you keep my commandments." So, we're happy for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, may I have little uh Daniel Kabika? Yeah. Okay. Let's turn him the other way here. There we go. Oh, yeah. Look at all of that hair. Huh? Oh, yeah. There we go. He's Oh, yeah. Can you all see him? He's just relaxed. He's in the arms of a shepherd like his father. Yeah. Let us all bow our heads if you would please. Our kind heavenly father, as we have gathered here this morning and also to have the time of dedication of this little love gift that you have given to brother Martin and sister Grace and father, the fruit of their union has brought forth a son. They've asked him that he would be a judge for God, that he would be judged of God. And a judge always brings a verdict. And the verdict is that he is forgiven. And therefore, because he's forgiven, there is fellowship. Because the fellowship was broken in the garden, but now it's being restored back again. &gt;&gt; We're going back to Eden. Father, I pray for little Daniel Kiba Malumba. I now dedicate you back to God. The life that came from God is now going back to God. And so therefore, Father, we place him into thy hands and ask that you will take this little son and let him be father a great judge for God between right and wrong. I pray that you will bless him all the days of his life, health and happiness. May he be a son that will bring honor to his father and mother. I thank you and I praise you. I ask this for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Help me here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. God bless you, brother. Sister Grace. God bless you richly. Amen. Thank you. Amen. I'm looking for Sister Julie Aila. Is she here? Sister Julie. Are you here this morning? Sister Julie Aila, as you know, has moved back here to to Phoenix. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You haven't seen her this morning. She's getting prepared. Her son Josh, as you know, has had jaw surgery, ear surgery, and everything to help. He's had some hearing problems and different things. And some complications have arisen from the surgery. And I thought if she was here this morning that we would have her to bring little Josh forward because tomorrow she drives back to Colorado. the operation has created a little bit of an infection and the infection she went to the emergency room to have the doctors here look at it and they said we recommend you go back to the doctors who did the surgery that sort of thing so they kind of know the situation and let them deal with it so um let's just bow our heads now as we pray for so that's okay we'll wait until these brethren get seated here God bless them. Let's pray for a moment. Heavenly Father, it is upon my heart to pray for little Josh. Lord, you know the operations, you know the situation and the enemy has come and tried to bring some infection to create a a problem. Father, I'm asking as she goes back to the doctors who did the operation tomorrow and she's going there so that they can deal with that. I pray that you will first off touch Joshua, Lord. I pray that when he goes there, they might not even find an infection. Father, because you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're a God that meets every need. I pray that you will bless little Joshua, Sister Julie, as she drives back to be with them. I pray in Jesus Christ's name, claiming a victory for your glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, yes. Also, yeah. Brother Steve, &gt;&gt; would you come up here, please? You all know Brother Steve is a veteran. He was in military service. He knows what it's like to be in battle. And he's still a soldier. Come up here, Brother Steve. &gt;&gt; Amen. H &gt;&gt; hard to get up, isn't it? &gt;&gt; If I don't fall. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Steve, come on over here and share with us. You're you're going to be leaving to go where? Now here. Uh yeah, I'm going to be going back to uh Thailand. I'm supposed to be leaving uh next weekend and uh I work uh in the Esan Providence and uh I'll be going to about six six seven different villages and uh I have uh some very close friends that are in Serpentin which is on the Cambodian and Thai border there. and uh I'd like to get down there and see him. So, uh I got to see what the situation is. I never worry when I go over there because God's always with me, you know, in the good times, in the bad times, you know. I'm not going to say every time I go there, you know, I got victories. a lot of times they come back, you know, and you don't have victories, but you keep praying. &gt;&gt; And uh I know God someday I've been praying. I've been going to Thailand for about well this year will be 48 years. And uh I'm praying that uh brother Ron went with his wife and I I know God's going to get this message in there, you know, and uh they I support and help the ones with the light that they're in, you know, and we are very fortunate. You can't imagine what we know, but they take the little lights they have because a lot of times when they accept Christ, they're thrown out because Buddhism is very strong in Thailand. Very strong. And it starts when they're young all the way up to the schools. So, yep. I just keep moving on, thanking the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Steve, what do you do in going over there? Do you have a job function that you actually &gt;&gt; Well, I I do quite a few things. Uh I work with different people. Uh I try to help some of the churches and witness over there. And then also because I'm a teacher, English teacher. I do go in try to go in the schools and I teach English. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And work and uh that's what I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're also a witness for him &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; Ambassador of Christ. Yes. All the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to pray over you right now. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; our brother Steve, Father, you know his testimony. You know he is a witness for you. &gt;&gt; We're asking you to watch over him. Be with him. Father, let him be a light in a dark and dying world. Let him be a witness of Christ of this hour. I pray that you will bless him his his time over there with the people and I pray that he would be a great witness to those into these remote villages places where many times people do not go but he goes. Father be with him and watch over him and keep him I pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Steve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll see you the end of February. &gt;&gt; See you the end of February. Amen. Malachi, help him down. Amen. Amen. Now, today is going to be a little bit different. Um, today is going to be my quote Christmas message, but I'm not much into Christmas because Christmas, according to history, is a pagan holiday. &gt;&gt; How many know that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preaches a sermon, Christianity versus Idolatry. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh, so what I'm going to be speaking on today may be in a different direction. Uh, but I want you all to listen because I believe that God's got a word for you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh, so I'd like you all to stand. Let's sing. Only believe. Only believe. Yes. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. All God bless you. You can be seated for just a moment. We have here brother Isaiah Brooks. Brother Isaiah, you came to be a part of this wedding yesterday. The bridegroom is going to be going to your church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we want you to come up here and bless the Had I known you as coming. I'd be sitting down over here. &gt;&gt; But God saw fit for you to come. Would you come up here? You've been a blessing &gt;&gt; to many of the people around the world. He's quite a singer. He asked, he said, "Brother Ron, do you mind if I bring my tambourine?" He said, "No, play it. Let you know." And uh I remember over in um we were in Israel together. We made a tour of Israel and I believe we were in the city of Cesaria and there they had an amphitheater, an old Roman amphitheater and we had just all gathered and we were up in the amphitheater and were walking around. This is a historical place and there's a stage up there and uh we were just kind of taking in and taking photos and we're looking in at this historical place and then uh brother Isaiah came out onto the stage and this is a natural amphitheater and it echoes why he has a voice that doesn't even need an amplification system. &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden you you hear and in this corner, a mighty champion, and he begins to sing.

Brother Creed and Sister Abigail, their family. &gt;&gt; Where is Creed? Did he step out a minute? Ah, I tell you that's okay. I'm glad he slipped in. He slipped out for a moment. But we love Brother Creed. I remember back when we had a prayer meeting at our church on Maryland Wednesday night. Do you remember that? You wrote it down. a little overhead projector and says, "Is there anyone here that has a prayer request?" Yes, Abigail. Yes, brother. Oh, yes, Amy. Well, I've got a friend of mine and I'd like you to pray for him. His name is Creed. I said, "What?" Yeah, his name is Creed. After we came to know him, I said, "He's the only Creed I'm going to allow in the church." Anyway, we're so pleased to have you, Sister Abby. &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew chapter 24. I'm a little shook up this morning. He's been dealing with me since last night. And this morning it just started coming like a fire hydrant. &gt;&gt; Actually, I I had to tell him, "Slow down. I can't go that fast." Matthew chapter 24 verse 43. Actually, I'll back up to 42 for to get a more complete text. Watch therefore, for you know not what hour your Lord does come. But know this, that the goodman of the house, if he'd have known what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and he would have not suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler of his own household, to give them meat in due season. Blessed is he. Blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. Turn with me if you would to the book of St. Luke chapter 2. Luke chapter 2 verses 1-5. So, I wish for just a moment this morning. I'm not going to keep you very long. I I told Brother Robert I only got, you know, page and a half of notes. He said, "Well, that's an hour and a half right there. Luke chapter 2 verse 1-15. And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. This taxing was first made when Sirenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary, his espouseed wife, being great with child. And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. And there was and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward all men. And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us go now even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." May God bless the reading of his word, and you all may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord. Now, I'm titling this because I'm not finished with this little thought that I had, but I'm going to go in another direction. So, just kind of bear with me this morning, but I titled this uniting time and sign part two. And I would like to title my sermon or take the subject of this title and I would like to declare God's gift to himself. &gt;&gt; You see, 2,000 years ago, God gave a gift to the world. 2,000 years later, &gt;&gt; God gave a gift to himself. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to be spiritual and I want you to follow along. Now, &gt;&gt; so this will not be a normal Christmas message because we know as Christians that this really is a pagan holiday. And for some of you that have not been here and seen the the teachings that we've brought out through the message and the word of God and everything and that we know that Christ was not born on December 25th. It's that goes all the way back to ancient Babylon. And so we see that the devil is trying to bring back another Babylonian worship by taking away from the birth of Christ. One thing I enjoy about Christmas is at least at least it makes the world stand up and pay attention for a moment. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That there was a child born. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this one had such an effect he split time in half. &gt;&gt; BC and AD. &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a pretty profound character that would come in that every time you sign a check, every time you put a date on something, you are talking about from the time of his birth. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; What an effect &gt;&gt; this Christ child had. Now friends, I'd like to take a few moments this morning to parallel the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to his second coming. Because we know that just as the world missed him because of misconstrued ideas in theology, they missed him. They were looking for a king and God sent him a baby. &gt;&gt; See, God interprets his word how he wants to. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how we figure it out, how the theologians figure it out or the religious people, God brings his word to pass. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says God is his own interpreter. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will always bypass man's interpretations of how Christ would come and fulfill the prophecy. So I want to launch off now into another portion of scripture found in Hebrews chap 10. Hebrews 10:es 1-9. So now watch this because things are types and shadows. Brother Brennham said, "I'm a typologist." &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch what happened back then and you will see what will happen now &gt;&gt; because history repeats itself. As it was, so shall it be." &gt;&gt; All right. Hebrews 10:es 1-9. For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. For then would they have not ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared for me. &gt;&gt; Notice this. He's not interested in sacrifice and offering, &gt;&gt; but he's going now to a body &gt;&gt; in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. Thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God. Above when he said, "Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin, thou wouldest not. Neither had his pleasure therein, which is offered by the way, excuse me, by the law. Then said he, "Lo, I come to do the will of God. He taketh away the first that he may establish the second." So, I kind of feel compelled to preach this this morning. I want to put you in remembrance of those things that came to pass in the first advent or the first coming of Christ. Just as it was in the first Christmas, if we call it that, the coming of Christ, the word was being made flesh in a Christ child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So this event must take place again today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a mystery." talking about a husband and wife and a marriage and the two became one flesh. &gt;&gt; There is uniting taking place. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that the word has got to be here &gt;&gt; in some kind of form for you to be united with it. &gt;&gt; And as I told you before, he's not taking a forgiven woman. And he's taking a woman that is justified, meaning she never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this union is a sign and it also is a declaration of the time. &gt;&gt; For God will bring his word to pass in its season. &gt;&gt; Understand, we've got to know the season in the hour in which we're born. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sends a prophet because a prophet becomes the mouthpiece of God and he takes you back to the scripture. It's written &gt;&gt; and he begins to take modern events and MAKES THEM CLEAR BY THE PROPHECY OF THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we see that the same thing that took place back then is taking place again today but in a mystery form. Now the brother Brennham said the greatest thing that God could give a man outside of salvation is what? &gt;&gt; A wife. Think of this. So God gave himself, &gt;&gt; a wife, &gt;&gt; she will be bone of his bone, &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh, &gt;&gt; she will be him. And the voice that was in the star messenger. You see my brother, my sister, understand the voice did not stop &gt;&gt; when Malachi 4 went off to sing. &gt;&gt; That's right. In fact, I tell you, Revelations 10:7, when he shall begin to sound, &gt;&gt; I say there's still a sounding. &gt;&gt; It's not just on a tape, &gt;&gt; but it's in a corporal body &gt;&gt; because that anointed word has taken on flesh. &gt;&gt; Are are you following with me? So, how shall these things come to pass seeing that I know not a man? This is exactly what regardless of how much supernatural and vindications and signs and wonders and angels and and shepherds coming and all this stuff, Mary was saying unto herself, well, how can this come to pass? Seeing I know not a man. I want you to understand that this message is not the message of William Brennham. &gt;&gt; He was only the voice. &gt;&gt; He was only the vocal cord. Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; But there was a voice behind the veil. We saw the veil. &gt;&gt; But there was a voice behind it. &gt;&gt; There was a picture within the picture. &gt;&gt; So how shall these things come to pass, seeing I know not a man? Because Mary was saying, "Okay, what does all of this mean? How are you going to bring this to pass? Because I've not known a man yet." &gt;&gt; This angel said, "Not many days hence." And the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you, and you shall conceive, and you shall bring forth a child, and you shall name him Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you Are you following this thought now? &gt;&gt; Angel, &gt;&gt; chosen vessel. &gt;&gt; She's trying to comprehend &gt;&gt; just like all of us are trying to comprehend. What is this message all about? What is it to do? It's to not just tell you how to go to church. &gt;&gt; Brother Random says, "I'm here to tell you how that you might be the powerhouse of the living God." &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what house were you building? &gt;&gt; What temple is he coming to? That's right. &gt;&gt; Just as there was a virgin woman chosen of God to receive that anointed word that the angel messenger had spoken. So again, there's been a word that has come through a star messenger. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a reason we come together this morning that we might worship him because they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wise men still seek him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, the word will become quick and made alive by the work of the Holy Spirit to BRING FORTH A CHRIST child in this hour because he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and you shall conceive. So this overshadowing that is taking place has within it the power to conceive &gt;&gt; to as many as would receive him. To them gave he the power &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God to conceive &gt;&gt; because in non seed they can hear the same word and it brings no conception. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said nonseed cannot be quickened. &gt;&gt; Oh, they feel anointings. &gt;&gt; He said, "But there's nothing to quicken the seed inside because there's no seed there to be quickened." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the difference between us and them &gt;&gt; because you have got a predestinated seed inside OF YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT SITTING THERE AND KEEPING CHRIST 2,000 YEARS AGO. THE DEVIL IS NOT AFRAID OF A GOD OF HISTORY. &gt;&gt; You can keep him in a manger. You can sing Noel. You can sing oh Bethlehem and all of the songs and you can have a Christmas pageant. And you can have shepherds and sheep and camels and wise men AND YOU CAN COME. BUT THAT'S JUST A GOD OF HISTORY. &gt;&gt; I want to BRING A GOD OUT OF HISTORY TO A GOD WHO'S CONTEMPORARY, WHO'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This conception is the overshadowing by the Holy Spirit himself. It is without the instrumentation of man. &gt;&gt; Mary said, "How will this be, seeing I've not known a man?" &gt;&gt; Because this conception &gt;&gt; because that which is born of the flesh, &gt;&gt; it's flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that which is born of the spirit is spirit. &gt;&gt; It will not be the intellectual interpretation of some theologian. It will not come through carnal understanding, but it is actually an act of the Holy Ghost which will bring forth an immaculate conception. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham actually said the new birth is actually he says of greater understanding &gt;&gt; than of natural birth. There's something that happens when there is a uniting taking place. Now we're talking now be spiritual and understand when a husband and wife have been united together and in the act of love she may be carrying the o but he carries the germ of life &gt;&gt; and the female without the life from the male &gt;&gt; cannot conceive. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, every one of you women from the time that you have come to the place physically and of age you start becoming a woman. And it shows in a cycle of life. And every month if you do not have the seed fertilized, it goes through a cycle. And if that seed is not germatized, it is passed out of the body. But now when she has this germ of life come from the man, now remember every seed was must bring forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the carrier of life is in the mail. &gt;&gt; She has the oam. &gt;&gt; She's the incubator. &gt;&gt; AND WHATEVER SEED SHE TAKES INTO HER MIND, INTO THE WOMB. &gt;&gt; If it conceives, IT'LL BRING FORTH EITHER OF GOOD OR OF BAD. &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ALLOW INTO YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS THE WOMB TO YOUR SPIRIT. YOU FEED IT ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, YOU BECOME THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU FEED IT ON THE WORD, YOU BECOME THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Guard your mind. &gt;&gt; It will be a greater conception. It'll be without human desire. WITHOUT ANY KIND OF HUMAN intervention whatsoever, without man trying to bring the word to pass through carnal understanding. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your help. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years ago, it was the first coming of Christ. Here we are again in a setting of prophetic history. Back then it was the coming of the prophetic spoken word birthed by a virgin. And many of them missed him fulfilling the prophecy by listening to false interpretation of religious ministries. &gt;&gt; It was a revealing of the son of man ministry veiled in human flesh of Jesus Christ. They missed it because of the veil. Because it came contrary to their understanding. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your help. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lean not to your own understanding." &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what house will you build in? What kind of dwelling place will the prophetic word make himself known in? Satan's not afraid, as I said, of some historical god. A god of 2,000 years ago. You can sing all the songs. You can get religious. You can say all of those things and do all of those things and make the the pageantry of the birth of Christ. And churches are more filled on two holidays here in America more than any other. Christmas and Easter. And both of them are pagan. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with this picture? &gt;&gt; But every Sunday we celebrate &gt;&gt; the resurrection in Christ. &gt;&gt; Because God has given us a new day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan's not afraid of a historical God. He just wants you to live in the glare of yesterday. Not in the light of what God is doing today. &gt;&gt; See, I as a minister don't want to just point you back to what God has done. &gt;&gt; Nor do I want to tell you about what God will do. Because so much of the time you can see what God has done and you understand MAYBE WHAT GOD WILL DO, BUT YOU'RE MISSING WHAT GOD IS DOING. &gt;&gt; FOR JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. WHY DID GOD SEND A PROPHET? &gt;&gt; What is this MESSAGE ALL ABOUT? HAS it had an effect upon you? Just as Herod, understand this now, as Herod who is just a figurehead of the ruling governmental powers of that day, Herod made a declaration, kill every manchild from two years of age, trying to stop the manifestation of this Christ child. Not only did the government seek to kill the effect, but there was also the religious ones, the Pharisees and Sadducees that rose up. Do you see the civil and ecclesiastical powers? Do you understand what's happening in America today? Revelation chapter 13, rising up like a buffalo. Huh? And he says, "But she will end by speaking like a dragon." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, no matter how much we try to put ones in office for authority to bring America back, she's done. She's history. She's over. &gt;&gt; So, we're not looking for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not looking We're Hey, listen. We're not &gt;&gt; MAGA. make America great again. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, THIS KINGDOM IS GOING DOWN. &gt;&gt; SHE REJECTED CHRIST, THE WORD. THEREFORE, she's being REJECTED &gt;&gt; AND SHE WILL suffer &gt;&gt; and she's going TO BE JUDGED. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER JUDGMENT GOING ON right now. IT'S CALLED THE BRIDE OF CHRIST AND IT'S THE ONLY JUDGMENT SHE'S GOING TO RE RECEIVE. AND THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW BECAUSE JUDGMENT BEGINS at the house of God. &gt;&gt; We don't come here to see how good we are. We come here to see where &gt;&gt; what we do wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord help me &gt;&gt; this morning to bring a thought to the people. &gt;&gt; So there there was also a governmental system and a religious system Pharisees and Sadducees type of the clergy that they found fault with he who had the message of the hour. Every time that CHRIST WOULD SPEAK, THEY SAW IT. Find fault with what he was teaching. Oh, it's no different today than what it was then. &gt;&gt; No wonder there. Well, he said this wrong, said that wrong. Uh h how many I want to ask you a question. When Jesus fed 5,000, how do you know it was 5,000 exactly? Were any of you there? Did they take a headcount? that they count and say, "Let me see. Okay, one, two, three, four. Hey, you you disciples, go out there and count, everybody. Bring it back together. Let's put it on our computer and find out. Yeah, exactly 5,000." &gt;&gt; Listen, it doesn't matter the number. So many people try to find problems within this message with something so weak as a number. &gt;&gt; Who cares? But you see, they found fault with Christ in that day. &gt;&gt; And they're going to find fault with the Christ of this hour. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what is Christ? Christ is an anointing. &gt;&gt; That's why when some of the disciples came to their brothers and said, "Hey, come. We have found the Christ of this hour." &gt;&gt; Whoa. Where'd he come from? &gt;&gt; Well, he comes from Bethlehem. Can any good thing come out of Bethlehem? They find fault &gt;&gt; with wherever they can. &gt;&gt; They want to show you, hey, don't listen to this man. So they brought an indictment against Christ in that hour and they crucified him. So I want you to understand that there's been an indictment reached in this hour and there's been a prophet who said I indict this second generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. this generation for the second crucifixion of Christ the word. &gt;&gt; They're doing it everywhere. &gt;&gt; Trying to take away from the anointed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the devil wants to do. &gt;&gt; Okay? He wants to throw in his doubts and all of his misinterpretations and try to get you all confused. And then really, what is truth? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what truth is. It's his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not just his word, &gt;&gt; but it's the revelation of that word. &gt;&gt; Revelation to you is more powerful than you can ever really realize. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation when it comes and strikes that seed, it brings forth a life out of that seed and brings it into A MANIFESTATION. YOU TELL ME that you believe this message of the hour. LET ME SEE THE MANIFESTATION &gt;&gt; OF THAT PROPHET'S MESSAGE WHICH IS the word for this hour. Let me see it in your life. &gt;&gt; Because a tree is known by its fruit. &gt;&gt; Show me the fruits of the message in your life. Brother Brenham says in the indictment, there it is. The sign of the time, WHAT DID THEY CLASS HIM? A fanatic, a crazy man. Yeah. They found fault with the man who was the word. He was the word. St. John the first chapter proves it. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. He was the living word of God because he was expressing God through himself. &gt;&gt; He was so completely surrendered to the word of God till he and the word was the same. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the church ought to be today. &gt;&gt; So he's typing what Christ was then is what the church ought to be today. That's exactly what the church ought to be today. And the word of God is the same. How can you be a part of the word when you deny practically all of it? &gt;&gt; And the reason it's done is because the people, that's the reason I think God spoke to me about calling his people Ricky's and Rkettas. How many know brother Brandon was rebuked of the angel said because he kept saying Rickys and Retas, &gt;&gt; right? Now, I thank God that God corrected him because I was one of them. &gt;&gt; You can't judge a book by its cover. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've got seed out there that look like a Ricky, but he's not a Ricky. &gt;&gt; They look like rakettas, but they're not raketas. &gt;&gt; Just wait until the word has an effect and the revelation they'll come out of that. And because of these selfish denominations has got those people living out there in the way they're living. They've crucified the truth and people call it a blasphemy and made it blasphemy rather. They call it a fanaticism and so forth and not knowing that they're blaspheming the very god that they go to church to serve. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I indict the bunch of clergy today. I indict this generation in the name of Jesus Christ under the anointing of God's word. You are c crucifying him again. My as the word was crucified 2,000 years ago. The religious system had crucified the effects of the word so it could not come into their flesh. In God's, if I could say this, in God's first Christmas, he wrapped his gift in a paper that didn't look too nice to wrap such a great gift. Wrapped it in swaddling cloth. And he there was no room in the end. There was no royal bed for him to come to. They laid him in a manger. Why would they lay him in a manger? Because that's where lambs are born. &gt;&gt; So here they God sent him a prophetic word and he gave him a baby. You see, God can fulfill his word so contrary to our understanding. That's why, my brother, my sister, until we fully catch a grasp of this revelation, &gt;&gt; all you'll do is make out of brother Brandham's message creeds and dogmas and laws. &gt;&gt; We don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; We want the life of God &gt;&gt; inside us. It was a uniting time in sign in that day. And I say and declare unto all of you and listen to me carefully. There's another uniting time and sign going forth right now. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. 2,000 years ago, it was the bridegroom coming of Christ. Now, in this day, it's the bride coming of Christ &gt;&gt; because God's got to bring &gt;&gt; Omega back to Alpha. &gt;&gt; See, uniting it back together. What's he doing? He's giving himself &gt;&gt; a bride. &gt;&gt; What is she? bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. &gt;&gt; So now it's a mystery in another form. Did you know you're a mystery? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You are the mystery &gt;&gt; that is being unfolded in this very hour to know who you are, where you come from, and where you belong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So watch this. In is in the sermon it is the rising of the sun. Now the sermon title speaks volumes. &gt;&gt; There was a rising of another son. Don't think of just the physical son but a rising of another son. &gt;&gt; As Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth. Although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept. In the bride coming of Christ, coming out of the church, there'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. &gt;&gt; Notice in the bride coming of Christ, &gt;&gt; waving of the sheath. What is the sheath? The first one to come to mature. The first one that proved it was a wheat. that proved it WAS A SHEATH. HALLELUJAH. I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This waved over the people. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND MALACHI 4 WAS THE first one in Laosa that came to a manifestation of a son of God. &gt;&gt; He was the wave sheep &gt;&gt; and it was waved over the congregation. I've been around the world seven times. What was God doing? weaving the sheep &gt;&gt; to show the rest of the field what it will become. &gt;&gt; The first time there will come forth the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the full maturity of the word has turned back again in full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders. as he did back then. &gt;&gt; Now, in closing, musicians, if you want to come, here's something very astounding I found in the message in the seven church age book. Brother Brandon preaches this, but now he's standing in the midst of the church, and he stands there revealing who he is in this last age. He calls himself the author of the creation of God. This is another creation. This has to do with the church. &gt;&gt; This is a special designation of himself. &gt;&gt; Wow. Look at this. Let this sink in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a special designation OF HIMSELF. HE IS THE CREATOR OF that church. &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created &gt;&gt; his own bride. &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created &gt;&gt; his own bride. &gt;&gt; How'd he do it? He spoke the word. &gt;&gt; And she will be like this. And she will be like that. &gt;&gt; She will have this virtue. She will be like of this character. &gt;&gt; She will be dressed like this. This is how she'll act. This is how she'll talk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? This message has had a profound effect. If this message has not had a profound effect upon you, listen to me. I doubt your seed. &gt;&gt; Say it like it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you are elect seed, what will it do? IT'LL HAVE AN EFFECT. &gt;&gt; WHY? COME UP HIGHER. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. BE SEPARATE, SAITH GOD. &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. &gt;&gt; As the spirit of God, he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells which his body was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body. It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to human oam supplied by Mary. That would have been a sinful man mankind producing a baby that would have not produced the last Adam of him. It was said, "Lo, a body hast thou prepared? Hast thou father prepared for me? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Not Mary &gt;&gt; provided that body. &gt;&gt; Mary was a human incubator. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And she carried the holy child and brought him forth. It's it was a God man. &gt;&gt; He was the son of God. &gt;&gt; He was the new creation. Man and God met and joined. He was the first one of the new race. He is the head of this new race. Colossians 1 verse 18 says, "And he is the head of the body, the church, &gt;&gt; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that all things might have the preeminence." 2 Corinthians 5:1 17, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, &gt;&gt; he is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away. Behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There you can see through that. Though man was of the old order of creation, now in the union with Christ, YOU ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're talking about uniting time and sight. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY THIS UNION WITH CHRIST, he has become the new creation of God. Ephesians 2 and10 says, "For we are his workmanship, created in union with Christ Jesus unto good works." &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4 and 24, "That you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This new creation &gt;&gt; is not the old creation made over &gt;&gt; or could not be called a new creation. That's exactly what it says. It's a new creation. &gt;&gt; It's another creation distinct from the old one. No longer is he dealing with the ways of the flesh. &gt;&gt; That was how he dealt with Israel. How he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue through the body, the God godly Isaac line. But now out of every kindred, tribe, and nation, he has purposed a new creation. He was the first of that creation. &gt;&gt; He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself. &gt;&gt; Do you see this new creation? &gt;&gt; He's creating a bride. &gt;&gt; She's made up of many members &gt;&gt; and yet she's one body. &gt;&gt; And God the creator creating himself a part of the creation. This is the true revelation of God. This was his purpose. This purpose took form through election. That is why he could look down to the last stage when all would be over and see himself stood in the midst of the church as author of the new creation of God. His sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree. He elected the members of this new creation. He predestinated them the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; By his omnipotent, his omniscience and omnipotence, he brought it to pass. How else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass. Ephesians 2:11, "In whom also have we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined." Understand this. A woman in scripture has her inheritance through her husband because when she's joined to her husband, she's joint hes with his inheritance. &gt;&gt; So understand a woman herself. That's why Every man should have a wife. But yet we know there are some born within the body who are Unix. I'm not going to go into that. But for every atom, there is an E. I remember my mother telling me one time, she says, "No matter how ugly the man is or how unattractive, there'll be some woman they'll find him." Come on, man. You have seen some and thought, "What in the world did you huh? What did you see in him?" Now I want YOU TO UNDERSTAND GOD does not look at THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE &gt;&gt; BUT GOD LOOKS at &gt;&gt; the inward man. &gt;&gt; God wasn't looking at you on how beautiful you are, &gt;&gt; how manly or how FEMININE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; GOD LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE SEES HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HE LOOKS AT THE CHARACTER, NOT THE BEAUTY. BECAUSE beauty is vain &gt;&gt; and it passes away and how quickly it passes. &gt;&gt; Take a bride 18, 20 years of age. Give her several children, a few sunrises and sunsets. I was one time in in brother Dennis Oldm's house. His mother invited us over for dinner. Her husband had died many years before. And Dennis said, "My mom wants to cook you a meal. Would you come over?" I said, "Okay." So she greeted me. Oh, it was such a nice greeting. She said, "Brother Ron, just make yourself at home. Just look around. Go ahead." And there was all these photos and there was a picture of a beautiful bride on the mantle. My very feminine, very beautiful woman. I said, "Sister Oldm," in my ignorance, I said, "Sister Oldm, who is this? I don't recognize her." Here she was cooking. Here she brother Ron, that's me. I thought, oh my, how quickly, sisters, your beauty will fade. No matter how beautiful you are, no matter what kind of lotion you put on your skin, no matter what kind of covering you put upon your body, it's dying. Your beauty will fade. But there is a beauty that lies within the elect &gt;&gt; that is not, you know what that beauty is? It's the character &gt;&gt; of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the beauty. Take not your outward appearance like the women do in the world of the braiding of hair and wearing of clothes and trying to make herself look beautiful. &gt;&gt; But let it be the hidden man of Christ within each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; So he now is creating for himself a bride. How did he do it? He sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; And that prophet began to speak. &gt;&gt; He began to tell us &gt;&gt; sermons like choosing a bride. &gt;&gt; He said, "This is what this bride will be like. She'll have character. &gt;&gt; Her beauty will not come from Hollywood, but from the holy word." Amen. &gt;&gt; He began to tell us how God would be, what he was looking for, what kind of character, &gt;&gt; what kind of virtue she would have until what you realize that God was looking at a mirror of himself. She'll look like she'll look like me &gt;&gt; in feminine form. That's why brother Brennham said, "Watch." As the word was in Mary, he says, "So will the bride of this last day. She will bear an image of the husband, &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister. God 2,000 years ago gave a gift to the world. Wasn't very pretty. the rapper. There was no beauty in him that we should desire him. The clothing he wore did not differentiate him from anyone else. In fact, when they went to make him a king and it wasn't time. He walked out among them and they couldn't find him. God is revealed in simplicity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look what God is doing in this day. &gt;&gt; Has he not chosen the things of this world that the the world looks at and said they're nothing? &gt;&gt; But has not God chosen the foolish things? &gt;&gt; That's why I say to all of you and you young people, you listen to me. God has called you. &gt;&gt; He's chosen you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You are the foolish THINGS OF THIS WORLD. DON'T BE foolish and follow the things of this world &gt;&gt; because he who seeks to save his life shall lose it. &gt;&gt; But he who seeks to lose his life for my sake shall find it. &gt;&gt; God is creating his own bride. &gt;&gt; How'd he do it? Spoken word. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about. It's creating a bride. &gt;&gt; That's why she understands the things that God wants her to do. Why? It's revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If I can get this bride to stand still long enough, I'll dress her in the word." &gt;&gt; Why? Because Ela eer. Okay? He went out to find a bride for Isaac. Ezer did not court the bride. &gt;&gt; He didn't try to cause her to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Neither did this messenger &gt;&gt; want you to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; He said, "No." He said, "Yes, I want the people to love me that I can bring them to you." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what was so attractive about this message. It had no Hollywood flare. There was no beauty in it. &gt;&gt; In fact, when I heard about holiness, I said to there is no holiness in in the world of religion today. You see, hey, look churches, go live any kind of life you want and dress any way you want to dress. Doesn't matter how you live. Doesn't matter what you put on. And I ask you, if that doesn't matter, why does God put it in his word? &gt;&gt; God bless you. I appreciate all of you this morning. And like I said, it was going to be a different service. And the thought that came to me, and I I had never read that quote before. If I did, it didn't come to me that God was creating a bride for himself. Are you not his workmanship? &gt;&gt; And yet he's not done with you yet. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say he's still working on me? &gt;&gt; I am his workmanship and when I get out of line and everything and the the clay, has not the potter power over the clay to make it a vessel of honor or dishonor? How many times has God had to rework your life a little bit? &gt;&gt; Get out of sorts, and all of a sudden &gt;&gt; the potter takes his hand, &gt;&gt; breaks down the the figure that it's making. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's not the way. That's that's not the form, the shape that I want it." &gt;&gt; And then God, he's got to add water to the clay to make it soft. Some of you get so hardened by the things of this world till when God wants to deal with you. The clay is so hard it can't be molded. That's why you've got to pray. Seek the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Let your spirit become soft before God and say, "Lord, work me. &gt;&gt; Take me and remold me. Make me the image the way you would want me to be." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together this morning. &gt;&gt; Thy word according to thy proises. I can stand secure upon my heart. the truth that sets me free according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Let's sing the song of Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom to me according to thy word, according to thy proises. I am sore not the truth that sets me free according to thy word to Jes. Let me be a vessel &gt;&gt; that I might bring forth the reflection of the word that I've received. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We say that we believe all this and we believe all the word. &gt;&gt; Then Lord, let there be a reflection. Why? Because the bride will be a reflection of him. &gt;&gt; She'll be a reflection of his word. She will be his virtue, his character. Because the same mind that was in Christ. Paul said, "Let this mind that was in Christ be in you." &gt;&gt; That you might become the mystery &gt;&gt; in this age revealed in its season. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why Malachi 4 when he came, Revelation 7, when he began to sound, &gt;&gt; the sounding of his message revealed the mystery of who you are. &gt;&gt; You began to see a reflection of yourself in the word &gt;&gt; and said, "That's me. &gt;&gt; I saw something about it, a reflection." How many of you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Here it is. Christmas time. Brought forth a different kind of a Christmas message. I'm not here to take you back and to rejoice about some historical god who was born thousands of years ago. Are they coming here to be prayed for? &gt;&gt; Come on up here. God bless you.
