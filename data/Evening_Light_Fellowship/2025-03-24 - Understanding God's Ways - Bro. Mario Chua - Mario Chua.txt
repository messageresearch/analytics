lives thank you for the word that you've been opening into our hearts Lord God thank you for letting us know who we are Lord so that we can live the life that you want us to live Lord God and once again we are so honored so blessed Lord to be in your presence Lord and asking once again that you come in your very special way minister to us the Word of Life Lord that we can live worthy of the Gospel May bless each and every one of us Lord sanctify our hearts and our mind this morning as we humble ourselves in your presence Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen amen I will say praise the Lord this morning amen so it's really an honor and privilege to serve each and every one of you amen and we'll go directly to the word of God I have this uh just a very simple thought this morning and I trust that the Lord will bless us this morning so thank you mician thank you brother Robert for setting at at me this morning just simple thought that uh my wife always asking me who is the preacher this morning and I always told her that it's the holy ghost that will be preaching amen because if I will be preaching people will run and go so praise the lord it's an honor to be in his presence so I want uh invite each and everyone to turn with me in the Book of Romans chter 8: 28 the very very simple and very familiar scripture we always uh quote this scripture but we always know that the word of God was written by inspiration that's right and it is the Breath of God that inspired the writer to write this so it's always alive there is always something in it even though how simple it is there is always something inside it am amen I think this is Brother Daniel La son God bless you brother amen Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen and may the Lord have the blessings upon the withing this word you may now be eting amen so I will uh title this a little thought the understanding of God's way and we know that according to Isaiah 58 that uh his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts so even just a little understanding of his way will sees our pain and our troubles and maybe disappointment Our Lives because this scripture that we know that all things works together for good to them that love the Lord amen thank you Lord yes it will be meaningful if we have a personal relationship with God we can appreciate this scripture if we have this personal walk with God because as the prophet said that I will just take my time and just to relax amen cuz the prophet said God don't have any grandchildren that's right only Sons and Daughters of Goden so everybody needs to be born again yes amen so we need to experience a personal relationship ship with God in order to appreciate the scripture that all things not only the good things because we are always enjoying the good things the blessings that comes our way we always appreciate God we praise him for the good things that come our ways amen so the good things and all things is also included the bad things that's right our disappointment our embarrassment our discouragement our failures and the scripture said that all things bad or good works together amen and the emphasis is if you love God so you need to be in love with God and you can appreciate how that the all things works together for good to them that love the Lord and to them who are called oh Hallelujah so if you're not called of God in these last days the things that comes your way you will always question God you will be discouraged you will run away from God but if you love God Amen you appreciate and understand that everything that comes our ways good or bad amen is for our own good especially the next verse when he said for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of God everything that comes away bad or good it is for the purpose to conform us into the image of his son praise the Lord that he might be the first born among many Brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called yes and whom and and whom he called them he also praise God Justified or glorified amen so so this is more about trials but when it comes to our position in Christ we are already sealed yes sir so when we wake up about what we preached uh the last time about the events of the doors and we know that we have already at it was in the days of solom so shall it be at the coming of the son of manen and we are witnessing in these last days that the son of man is revealing himself again and it was in the days of Noah solom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man and we know that Noah was sumon to come up or come into the ark which is power in our age Revelation 4:1 that says come up hereen and will show you things to come amen so when Noah entered into the ark it was God who shut the door no one shut it but it was God Amen but the prophet said but I want you to pay attention even though the door was shut even though our posession position is already secured we are Sons and Daughters of God and the prophet said you need to watch because the testing time is still in inside the ark that's right although our position already secured we realize that we are Sons and Daughters of God predestinated before the foundation of the word we walk according to the Revelation that was given to us but the testing is still inside the ark as we said a while ago that the testing is not to prove Noah Faith but to test his faith in other words to reveal his faith in other words to express or to express his faith because remember we inside the ark God said that I will destroy the Earth and when he shut the door God shut the door Noah is expecting that God is going to fulfill his word amen amen but the first day it didn't rain come on second day and then train that's right there must be a commotion inside the ark all those animal the pool or something like that the noise did Noah can bear the the the pressure inside outside of the animals the lion when he Roar maybe the elephant when he cry all those animals remember the pressure and Noah is waiting for the Fulfillment of God's promise to judge the word but it didn't happen but he continue on as we the quot last time that Noah continue on as the prophet said our testing is still going on Amen but remember we are already heard The Voice Hallelujah we are now in the process of the changing of our body and Noah is in the process going going into another world because he heard the shout and we know that the shout the voice and the Trump is now in progress amen so it was not a trial to prove his faith because he already proved his faith because for 120 years he waited and he entered that is proving his faith but then inside he wait for seven days that is to display his faith he never wobble amen and remember how can he wobble how can he be discouraged that it was God who shut the door glory in other words we are sealed until the day of our Redemption so whatever happens in our life the testing time is not to prove our faith but to display our faith in these last days as the prophet said that we are being called from this Satan Eden that's right to prove to Satan that there will be a bride that will not bow down to his deception in this last day there will be a bride that will stand and will display the word made flesh in these last days amen it was not to prove but to display his fa just like Abraham in chapter 22 when God told him Abraham I want you to sacrifice your son so it was not to prove his faith because he already proved his faith for 25 years he waited for the promise to come to pass he waited 25 years and God fulfilled it but now after a few years later God appeared again and said I want you to sacrifice your son and I want you to sacrifice your son in the mountain that I'm going to show you and if you read your scripture early in the morning he rise up and go ye don't waste any time right amen amen so when God called you or touch you this morning don't waste any time response to the word of God don't wait for tomorrow because maybe tomorrow it'll be too late right he responds immediately and go and bring to Young L with him to young people yes amen maybe Abraham is so unconscious but he knows within his heart amen so he brought his son and his two young people and God gave him three days three days to think it over you know Isaac was his testimony amen that he become a father of many nation and he he already proved the faith he loved Isaac so much and even God told him sacrifice your only son remember that he has two son amen amen but the son of the promise is only Isaac so God is so specific sacrifice your son God gave him three days to think it over that's why God is so gracious he don't easily judge God is longsuffering he gave him three days to think it over to change his mind but after three days instead of changing his mind he said okay you two young people wait here I and my lad will go upstairs and worship God and we'll come back to you hallelujah amen so instead instead of changing his mind he was determined because he knows that he received Isaac from the dead so if God if ever that God or Isa or Abraham will bring sacrifice God will raise up but he tried it he goes out there yes and he bring the altar sacrifice and Isaac said father there is the altar the sacrif where is the sacrifice and Abraham said the Lord himself will offer a sacrifice that's right and when he is about to offer a sacrifice an angel of the Lord appear Abraham I know you displayed your faith amen amen there is already a ram as the prophet said that Ram was not birth it was the spoken word that's right and who spoke the ram into existence Abraham did amen amen so that's why the spoken word now is to dis be displayed in this last days because Faith Hallelujah is already in each and every one of us God is going to display what he put in our heart he need to display it physically so when Abraham said the Lord himself shall offer a sacrifice who is the mouthpie of the Lord Abraham did because he said the Lord himself shall offer sacrifice and the ram appear amen amen so that's why in these last days we need to see God's ways while we are in a stage of our testing time this is not to prove our faith but to display the faith that God put in our heart amen amen so we will we know that we have a lot of example when it comes to the Old Testament Saints because all of the Testament Saints are their are shadows to the new things so maybe each and every one of us is a favorite uh character in The Bible but one thing that stand out in my heart while I read this scripture is the life story of Joseph as the prophet said that uh even brother brandham maybe one of his favorite character was Joseph because he named his son up that Joseph because the life story of Joseph if we can preach it it will take maybe months and months and months but I don't have the gift to preach about shers mine is just come and go God will pick something and put it or deliver it and that's it amen then the next day I will just wait for a call and get it and deliver it amen thank you Lord that's why I don't become a pastor because I don't have any patience that's why we appreciate that we have a pastor amen who was patience and caring always uh looking at the every details I always appreciate better one because he seems to know everybody in the church by name me I always forgot the name that's why I just forgive me I say hello brother hello sister I cannot mention name because I always forget names amen maybe that's the the the the greatest uh weaknesses that I have forgetting names I always hello brother what is your name and he said George few seconds what is your name so just forgive me for that but thank God that we have an address brothers and sisters I think that will be enough don't be offended when we call just you brothers and you forget the name but I think the sweetest thing that people can remember is their names so just when you approach me just introduce your name right away so that I can not forget amen so Joseph as the prophet said Joseph we can find perfection in Joseph so Abraham is by election and we know that Abraham was elected by God chosen by God praise God it is God's Sovereign will that he elected Abraham Abraham is nothing we know all the stories about Abraham and we can rely upon or can relate to our calling with God we are nothing we are we are not somebody but by God grace he called us out of millions of people on this Earth he called us many reject the message of the hour but we receive the message without any hesitation without any question we just believe it and we ourselves don't know why we believe believe it and that is by election amen and Isaac is justification because Isaac was the manifestations of the promise of God I we can say that Jacob is just Grace you know it's all Grace because Jacob as a deceiver a Cher but he found Grace in the eye of God thank you Lord so as the prophet said but in Joseph we can find perfection so the life story of Joseph we can see it all around from Genesis to the Revelation because Joseph is always a type of Christ and the life story of Joseph in Genesis is also patterned in The Seven jsh Feast of Leviticus chapter 23 so the uh Feast of Leviticus is the past over the unleaving bread the first fruit the Pentecost the trumpets the atonement and the Tabernacles so we also know that the life of Joseph is written throughout the Book of Revelation in symbol form because everything in Genesis in seed form will be multiplied in Revelation just like in Genesis you have Joseph revealing himself to his 11 Brethren so in the Book of Revelation we can see that it was God or Christ who revealed himself to the 144,000 in multiplied form in Genesis you have one woman EO is deceived in Revelation the whole world is deceived is the same thing but in multiplied form so in Genesis you have human flesh revealing the secret of the hearts that woman is Zara but in these last days and many membered body in the last days so Joseph represented Perfection as the prophet said that election in Abraham justification in Isaac Grace in Jacob but then perfection in Joseph so the mystery of the Life of Christ was revealed in the life of Joseph so then what was written of the life of Joseph in Genesis in story form must also be found written in the Book of Revelation in Syle form amen so that why God Is So Grace because what happened then will happen now what he's doing then is still doing today because he's the same yesterday today and forever if we can see the pattern we can see or appreciate God Amen that God is in working so the Feast of the Passover which is the first of the Jewish feast is represented by Joseph in prison where one man lives and the other man dies this was Christ on the cross where one Thief was saved and one the other was lost and then the Feast of the unle bread was where Christ's body was broken for us those two Feast the Passover the and living bread represent Christ's death then Joseph came out of prison and went to to the right hand of pero representing the resurrection of Christ which is the Feast of the first fruit taking place after Christ came out of the earth then the Feast of the first fruit is the Feast of Pentecost representing the seven Church ages amen the Gentile church and then after Joseph brother were gathered together because of the crisis and depressions that drove them out of their Homeland because the feast that followed the Peace of the Pentecost is the Feast of the trumpets the calling out of the Israelites amen and the Feast of the trumpets to gather the Jew back together for the Feast of atonement which is Joseph revealing himself to his brother which is these days Jesus making himself known to the 144 Jew by the true prophets of Revelation 11 of Moses and Elijah what message we receive in this last day will be preached to them again by this two prophets of Revelation 11 46 days 1,26 day which is three and a half years there remaining three and a half years after the seven or the seven of Daniel was cut off 3 and 1/2 years Jesus Christ fulfilled and three and 1/2 years will be fulfilled by this two prophet of Revelation 11 amen and notice that Joseph revealing himself to them not by them noticing his physical appearance but he reveal himself to them by his word I am Joseph it will be the spoken word again and Joseph brother were gathered together during a time of economic depression in this day it was the Second World wall that run them back to their Homeland a time of economic depression which is under the second woo and the sixth trumpet just bear with me we will be going there amen I'm just showing you the example of Joseph's life expressed naturally in all the Bible amen amen then the message that God in this hour has unlocked these things to us so we can see that we can get Joseph life story from the beginning of his life up to the end it speaks we have so many nuggets and lesson that we can get from Joseph life story and we can preach on and on and on and on but what attracts me is this if you can turn with me in in Genesis chapter Genesis 45 verse 5-7 after Joseph Journeys he come to realizations of what happened to his life that we can say that all things works together for good to them that love the Lord to those who are called according to his purpose and Joseph after his troubles and trials in his life he come to a realization that now he is meeting with his Brethren verse 45 verse 5 now therefore be not grieved so he's speaking about his brother not angry with yourself that he sold me he for God did send me before you to preserve life God sent me to preserve life amen for this two years had the Ping been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a prosperity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance amen amen in verse 7 again and God sent me before you he must have this personal experience with God that he realized that what happened to his life it was all about God's doing amen right and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so posterity is your descendant your future Offspring God sent me before you to preserve your posterity to preserve your descendant Amen to preserve your Offspring right in other words there would have been no Jewish Nation as we know it if God had sent Joseph to Egypt so God was not only saving the lives of the son of Jacob but if we notice he was also was saving all the millions of descendant of the 12 tribes of Israel that would come from this 12 patriarch because he said God sent me to preserve your posterity Hallelujah so if we read the story of Joseph it was not really God who throwed him in the ditch it was his brother but he said that it was God who said me but if we read in the chapter 33 it was his brother who hated him who was jealous with him that throw him in the ditch but what Joseph come to realize as the story goes is that it wasn't actually his brother yes it was God and this is what we must come to realize and that Understanding God's way we need to to realize that God is on the moveen all this was done by God for the purpose of saving life God is the author of life and the savior of life amen so we notice two things that are going on on here on this chapter 45 there was a worldwide famine that is to last for years ahead where in millions will go hungry and lose their businesses houses and lands and yet during this time we see an elected people being preserved without the need of money during the Ping time God knows what he's doing that's right he is preserving the lives of those elected people and we are now in the same situation praise the Lord so let's go back to or turn back in Genesis 42 verse 1-4 now when Jacob the father saw that there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his son why do you look one upon another and he said behold I heard that there's corn in Egypt get you down dether and buy for us from then that we may leave and not die Jacob heard because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word the Lord amen Jacob heard that there was blessings going on there was a God Who provided for all his people amen you need to go don't wait you need to go if you think that God is calling you if you think that God is blessing you God is knocking your heart go don't wait because it is a blessing if you feel that God is something Knocking at Your Heart amen as the script no one can come to me except the father draws him and all the father draws him I will no wayse cast them out if God is knocking you it's yours a blessing amen amen amen good notice that this setting that this was about buying food during a time of economic depression because the whole world was planted into depression because of famine so that their lives depended on this but but we see as the story goes along we find that they did actually need their money because God had prepared for this event in Joseph was the one who would became their provider for the Bride of this end time because Joseph which is type of Christ is on the scene again in this age because soon there will come an economic Squeeze In Our Generation look at what is happening in our days Trump will impose tari from the goods from Canada from Mexico from China and all and in retaliation they do the same so what will happen in our County that's why the issues now is about the egg the egg is too expensive now today during Co time it was toilet paper Brown out of toilet paper economic depression econom be squeezing but God provide everything amen amen thank you Lord he said Joseph ahead to be Hallelujah their provider during that time as Joseph's 10 Breen went down to buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph brother Jacob sent not his brother for he said Les perion Mischief before him and when we know that Benjamin was the younger brother of Joseph which is type of the 144,000 Jew so in Genesis 45 again and Joseph said unto his Breen come near me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt how do you think you feel when you commit something about that brother and he told you in your very face you sold me right he didn't called them because as a Christian we can know to we know how to handle ourselves but he told them with love amen come near me I pray you and he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold in Egypt if ye did sold him what an embarrassing moment during that time maybe you will feel you will hide and go home and never mind but not Joseph he really understood it was the spirit of God in Joseph in verse 5 now therefore be not gri he knows what they feel he know what he feels about them that's why he didn't wait for them to answer back because to let them know that they sold him is too much to handle right so that's why he was the one who pacified the feeling and now therefore be not gri nor angry with yourself that he sold me hither for God did sent me before you to preserve life Hallelujah and for this two years that P been in the land and yet there are 5 years in which there shall neither be nearing nor Harvest and God sent s me before you to preserve life to a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance all things works together for good to them that love the Lord thank you Lord Joseph could not be sitting on the throne without them throwing him in the ditch God works in a mysterious way and his ways and his thought is above our ways that's right so we need to understand understand his ways so that's why we can enjoy what is happening or coming our ways because this is not proving time this is manifestation time whatever comes our way is not to put us down but to reveal the faith that God put in our heart to be displayed thank you Lord that's why Joseph don't be grieve that you sold me but God did sent me hallelujah what a Revelations so Joseph's brother hating and throwing him in a pit and selling him as a slave and sending him Egypt to be sold and actually a part of the plan of God's Great Deliverance for them so if God deals like that for that family and he is the same yesterday today and forever then we know that is how is dealing with with us even with everything seems wrong and mess up with our lives also but we must also come to realize like Joseph that is not all wrong of life at all but it is God incontrollable Amen and we can find this in every Almost Family happening Brothers against Brothers as we a Christian we try our best to live a Christian Life we try our best to do good to others but sometimes you wonder why that even though you leave a good example you do a right thing you do a right decision somebody's not really happy about that and they try to put you down and try to uh uh uh make stories to put your character down and sometimes we wonder why yes remember that Spirit Never Dies that's right our flesh will die by the spirit that motivate will not die what motivate his brother to throw Joseph it was by jealousy right remember that in your life you try to do good you try your very best to be good but somebody's always putting you down even in your social media they're trying to put you down and sometimes it hurts you so much but remember if it happened then it's still happening now amen that's right because Spirit Never Dies if there are spirit that do hatred that throw jealousy there is always a spirit that says God sent me to preserve life Hallelujah so if you are that Joseph just live the life and enjoy that whatever happens in your surrounding in your life that you know that you're are serving Christ right you're serving your people right just stay in line amen they are jealous ascept because what Joseph have they don't have that's right that's why they try to kill him that's the only reason why people are go against you when you do something good and people go against you don't be upset just remember what you have they cannot have what you have is Christ in you so that's why they got jealous sometimes true so in order to avoid this huraches avoid your social media avoid posting your life in social media and wait for somebody to likes how many likes I have how many oh this this this is my friend but he don't put likes I will erase him delete him you cannot you have good intentions maybe to share but not everybody is [Music] Happy 99% people will get jealous because they cannot help it as long as we are in the place the nature of the place is jealousy backbiters high-headed minded lovers of pressures more Pride so in order to help even the fellow Christian in even in order to help them just avoid posting how you Poe how you smile wherever you just post the word of God repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's right and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost in everything give thanks I think that's the best thing that you can post in your social media the word of God that's right Hallelujah but not everybody can post that but you are now encouraged to post those words amen amen amen are you happy or not amen amen so we'll continue on verse eight so now it was not you that sent me hi but God and he had made me a father to pharaoh and the Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt so we can if we follow the life story of Joseph when he gets to the end of story of the life of Joseph from the prison house to the right hand of pharoh he begins to look back on the event of his life and realize that all the bad happening of his life were not bad things at all that's right in fact they were all working together for his good and they were all designed by God for the purpose of saving lives praise the Lord whatever we've been through now we need to look back and not be discouraged but thanking God that all those years that I've been through until now I'm serving God it was his grace amen it was not your strength it was not your ability it was not something that you do that you continue serving God when you look back it was God's promise I will be with you even in you until the end of the world Amen thank you Lord just like job when he suffered so much in his trial and testing it can stop him from worshiping God because his trial and testing has nothing to do with God that he serving that's right so in the midst of his trial and his testing he's still serving God the Lord give it and the Lord take it away and blessed be the name of the Lord that's right hallelujah amen and if we could only realize and understand that ourselves all the things that happen to us that we think are so bad but actually the purpose of God to bring about the saving of life for us and offering Offspring also because God can't act or deal any different with your life than he did with Joseph because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah so the life of Joseph portray The Life of Christ amen hallelujah so we as the sons of God are also portraying The Life of Christ in our different way in the message identification of all Christ in all ages identification of Christ in all ages Christ is the anointed word in all the ages amen Joseph a perfect example that was Christ in Joseph it was the word of God that motivated and inspired Joseph why you notice he was love of his father despised of his brothers because he was a seir they hated him without a cause the Same Spirit they hated Joseph they hated Moses so Doan and K arise and they asked question about Moses is he the only prophet in the land right right when Jesus come they hated him without a cause that's right where did this man come he didn't come from our denomination they hated brother bham even though he performed a lot of Miracles and in the Crusade likewise in our day the same thing amen they hate us because Christ in US is the one that they hate it's not our personal that they hate they have nothing to hate about us we are all different but it was Christ in us hallelujah that motivate them to hate us amen the man could help what he was he was an another brother hated him and a very good type of all ages because Spirit Never Dies amen always when a sear comes on the scene the rest of them hate him for the same cause as they did Joseph help it he could interpret their dreams never was he wrong he for told things never was he wrong and his brother hated him without a cause it did happen to our Lord Jesus Christ it also happened to brother Branham right so if happen to them it will happen to us too and notice his life portray Christ to us exactly even sold almost for 30 pieces of silver taken up out of the ditch and set at the right hand of per the ruler of the world at that day and every time he left the place they sounded trumpet and said every KN bow because Joseph is coming a perfect type of Christ in the billenium and when the the trumpet sound he come forth and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to him and notice in prison he was a prophet so if you born gifts and callings are without repentance amen you don't cultivate it you don't learn it you are born with a certain gift in your life amen gifts and callings are without repentance whatever happened to Joseph he will be put in prison thr into the dits but he remains to be a prophet that's when he was sold and put into prison on account of P Park's wife then we find that in the The Butcher and the baker they both had dreamed and he the dream and one was lost and one was saved so did Jesus on the cross exactly one was lost and was was saved and when he was in prison t to the Cross just a perfect example amen and Joseph was the son of Prosperity whatever no matter where he went it always prosper and when the time would come Hallelujah the prosperity to be with Christ will come soon amen amen because our Joseph is Christ who has made himself known to us by the revealed word of the hour so notice the parallel of what applies to the elected Jew also applies to the elected gentle bright because how he deal with the Jew is how also he deals with the Gentile bride bride in parel what was happening in noi was also happening in Ruth in paral what the seven seal is to the bride the seven trumpet is to the Jew yes in both cases it is Christ revealing himself to his elect amen he deal with Israel as a nation he deal with the Gentile as an individual but is all the same and when we study the life of Joseph we know that everything happens to him in experience is for the purpose of saving lives that's why God called us with a purpose and we need to find a purpose in our lives amen and so that is revealing the nature of God how he deals with us in the experience of Our Lives knowing and understanding God's way so when it seems like everything goes the opposite to how you think it should go then you can be certain that God is in your life because that is the way it has always been in the scripture concerning the elect of God God never changed that's right so whatever happen in your life look back in the scripture and it will give you consolations and comfort because how God delivered them is also how God will Deliver Us amen nothing changed that's why we have confidence to believe in his word because he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah so let's look at some of the event in Joseph's life in uh verse 37 this is the the the starting chapter of Joseph's life you know there are how many uh chapter about Joseph I think it's uh chapter 37 to chapter 50 but here in chapter 37 is starting and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was Stranger In the Land of Canaan and these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old so that's why sometimes the word of God is so specific in names in numbers because chapter or number 17 speaks about a prophet remember that our scripture is being fulfilled is Luke 173 Revelation 10 and 7 which is 17 and remember when brother Braham baptized the 17th person in High River then The Voice come as J bapst forrun first coming your ministry or your message will forrun the same second coming of Christ number 17 is the number of prophet 17 Jo was feeding the pla with his Brethren and lad was with the sons of baa with the son of Sila his father's wife and Joseph and brought unto his father their evil report now Joseph or Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his Brethren saw that their father Lov him more than all his Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him everything that Joseph is doing they give meaning unto it they bring malice unto what Joseph is doing amen remember that Joseph was his son is his old age so if you are the youngest among your siblings there's there is always a favoritism your dad always loved the youngest and some of the sibling had the reason to be jealous because whatever the youngest asked automatically the dad will give the father give but when some of the brothers ask okay forget it maybe next time we will give something to the youngest because he was young and God gave him and Jacob gave him a coat of many colors and when a father gave a son a many colors it speaks of prestige speaks of Loy royalty I we know the significant of the seven colors it speaks about the stature of a perfect man it speaks about the revelation of seven Church ages it speaks about the Seven Seals speaks about the seven bals seven trumpets so the inspiration was in Joseph so all these denominations brothers and sisters can get jealous because they don't have the revelation of seven search ages they don't have revelation of the seven seal they don't have the revelation of vials of the trumpet and all the feast they don't know nothing about it so that's why they got jealous and jealous and jealous and DED to put it down all that proper is all that Prophet is false prophet remember when you say false prophet you need to check yourself amen because the scripture will not say false prophet beware of false prophet if there is no genuine that's right they always capitalize when you share about the prophet they always capitalize in Matthew chapter 24 beware of false prophet how about the true Prophet amen so instead of saying you need to find the real Prophet because Matthew 24 say beware of false prophet we need to find the real prophet in the land sir so denominations will quote just scriptures pertaining to themselves and put a period in it and make denomination out of it that's why in the time of reformers when God showed Luther the justification he put a period in it I didn't want it it dies and God raised another and wly saw the second stage of Grace and he said and put a period in it Pentecostal put a per in it right but praise God hallelujah all those give but now we are receiving The Giver of the gift in our day Hallelujah and there is no more period it is all Kama because God is the SP inspiring himself in continuity God is revealing himself his thought and the prophet said are are the thought of God Eternal right if you can believe that God Eternal then you will see many things God is unlimited that's infinite and his in and his power never change but he keep on unfolding and unfolding and unfolding Hallelujah that's why his brother so hated him true that's why when you share the seven Church ages people are hat well did you get that why did you put the lest brother Bram well it's not for them it's only for the bride because how much effort you do to share if they are not part of the program of God they will just reject it because Elijah was sent yes to you a special class of people that's right and you recognize the calling without any hesitation that's why when I receive the message of the the first time I read about the the serpent seed I don't have any question I just Embrace and and praise God about that amen a lot of issues will go against all that's first prophet you cannot find an Apple you cannot find I don't need to argue because I cannot explain it but I believe it that's right God don't require us to to to to to explain it but he requires if you can only believe and if you can only believe and you can only believe if you part of the program of God because if you have no part in the economy of God you you will always reject the word of God Amen so that's why this brother saw that their father loved him more than all his Breen they hated and could not speak peaceably unto him have you met some of that I maybe in your classroom in your work that how much you think is right they always put a malice in it even just a simple word and that is so toxic in your workplace or maybe in school or whatever that every time in your heart is so so you become Jolly you just want to be what who you are but they give malice on it they put you down they sing they talk about you to somebody else this thing is just too small compared to our head compared to our body but it do a damage a lot of damage when you say something and somebody cuts it then they will add something to it then when somebody another heard they put something in it then somebody heard and they put something in it that's why New Birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ it is not a second-handed revelation you need to have your personal experience with God and don't rely to anybody who Shar to you his understanding or interpretation of the scripture we need to pray and kneel and ask God personally for the revelation of Jesus Christ because his church is founded or founded upon the revelation of the rock of Jesus Christ so we notice that even though there were bad family forces at work against Joseph it was God actually in all of this because his background hated his b was necessary remember it was NE necessary God is using it in order for all the others event that follow so that God could bring about all the events of his life for the purpose of saving them and their offspring if this family situation had been this way then the rest of the story even could never have taken place that's right and that's the Paradox of how God do it it's a family of prayer amen not only as our individual family our church family or any group of family you can always find that kind of spirit but remember all things works together for good thank you Lord to them that love the Lord amen the trial is not for them but it's for you you just need to recognize it just like Joseph God said me before you to preserve life that's a profound statement yes it takes a real revelation of the grace of God in our lives that's right because in these last days this is the most chaotic age that we are living in it was prophesied that these Generations are all heavym minded lovers of pressures truce Breakers in continent despises those who are stand for truth that's right disres respectful that's right to parents to their Pastor to their church right learning and ever learning and never come to the knowledge of truth right so this is the spirit that we are facing now but praise God we have the promise one of these days in a twinkling in a moment we'll be going out Hallelujah uh verse 39 verse 11 and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of them of the house therein within so this is now the stage where in Joseph what in Pip's house so this is the greatest Temptations of Joseph he was alone with P part's wife and it came to pass about this time so we need our young people to really be careful with all women running after you amen because our young people are all goodlook well dressed very neat and it's no wonder people will girls or women will try to run after them so that is the greatest weaknesses we need to be careful of our popularity of women and money and it came to pass after this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by His Garment what if our wife is having good time oh Joseph is alone it is my time I need to tempt Joseph and when she came that she saw that he had left His Garment in hand and was fled forth so you need to do just like Joseph did when women run up to you you need to run faster get out when they approaching you get out especially if they're not the message beli and even Mage believer cuz I heard that oh you don't need to to marry unbeliever you need to marry a Believer that's good but not Believers are real believers they just become Believers because they receive the spoken word and they they are identified to be a believer but the prophet said there are three kinds of Believers make believer and unbeliever or make believer and the real Believers and the real Believers don't run after men or men running after women they prayed they ask God for guidance amen because if you marry that is your The Binding is from time to Eternity right you need to pray you don't run because oh there are so handsome men oh the beautiful sister no you need to pray amen amen amen just like elaser find my son a wife elaser and he prayed after he prayed then it appears the wife likewise the same nothing changed don't run for anybody because he's is beautiful he is macho is a six no no no no no sixpack because we don't display sixpack forgive me because if you see in the all the people are really busy having sixpack they're showing their bodies the nakedness they are just fulfilling the spirit within the loud they are wet and miserable and they are naked and they don't know it physically and spiritually they are naked right so they need to be clothed by the revealed word of the hour and she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he had brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us and he came in unto me to lie with me and quied with a loud voice and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and quied and he left his garment with me and fled and got him and she laid up His Garment by her until his Lord come home so beware because whatever they say if they if the government or whatsoever The Same Spirit they will always take sight with the lies amen they don't take sight with the truth so that's why we need to be careful in our studies amen amen so we need as I I said ago we need to pray with the young people men you need to pray for a wife and or sisters we need you need to pray for don't worry about numbers or about your age age really doesn't matter it was by God's grace amen so don't worry just serve the Lord because God will just amen if you don't pray and just just i i i i i i i metet a brother that he don't really maybe he don't pray much but he married a so-called believer after a month they got divorced so sometimes you wonder why so I'm following following the advice of Propet and under no circumstance never marry an unbeliever but what I'm saying is I don't give this a lway that give you permission to marry an unbeliever but what I'm saying is you need to pray and wait upon the Lord don't rush into something don't give this braate if you don't maybe it's only here in America when young people get married so young in the Philippines you cannot find or seldom find any young people get married mostly they are adult age main they above 30s or something amen so let's go back let us not dwell into it I am not a pastor anyway notice how it was a woman that caused Joseph to fall from a position of power and Dominion all the way down to the prison house this parallel what Eve did to the human race when Adam fell from position of prosperity and power and Dominion under God to a prison House of this Fallen World look at all these events in Joseph life it all looks like a lot of bad luck thrown into the Deeds going to P the are being accused going to the prison house it seems like there is no good luck right it's all bad luck but there was no bad luck about this at all this was 100% the Providence of God for the purpose of saving lives what we often consider our battles and defeat in life are actually God's Providence of God to bring about a a great victory at the end am amen so everything all works together for good that love the Lord amen so last scriptures that would be saying Victory Day it seems like the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the the Christian life seems like hold so many disappointment think about it if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like whome many disappointments so you need to make sure that you live a Christian Life Amen in all you do in all your things make sure that you live a Christian life amen although you cannot perfect or Good Conduct but you need to leave a Christian believing the word of God right because whatever happens in our life we can still praise God but if you are not Christ centered or not living rightfully with God it seems like hold so many disappointments can you say Amen to that amen as we grow in the grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we can encounter disappointment in our life and sometime we question our life questions our status with God but it's a good thing you need to seek or check ourselves within the word of God why this happen why this happen you need to check but those disappointment listen to this are God's Divine will happening for us hallelujah now it don't seems like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he let us hit the river to see what we'll do amen hallelujah everything that comes our way is not by accident amen but it's God's way of doing things he let us hit the river to see what we'll do God let disappointment happens to show Victory oh if you could only see that You' only see that these things that seems to be buring buing you and upsetting you they are trials they are things to stand still you cannot get away from that you cannot get away from your sisting you cannot get away from your trials because we are tested to prove and to display the faith that God put in our heart amen there are things to stand still Focus your glasses on the word of God Amen just like when brother bam said when Noah is entering the ark and God shut the door there will be a distinct time he said focus on the absolute which is the word of God and speak the word not only you focus the word you believe it you need to speak it that's right don't just murmur murm murm Lord believe this believe you need to speak the word just like some of Brothers here just like sister Sandy I am Sandy Peterson in the name of Jesus Christ caner get out amen and canel Obey that's right you need to speak the word focus on the glass focus on the promise of God and speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to do it speak the word and walk forward we get to a time we say God I don't know what to do I'm up against it speak the word Lord I believe and just start walking forward and God that's the opening of the sea so just keep on walking whatever Tri you are in or disappointed coming just do focus on the word speak the word amen and God will open the sea so let us stand we need to keep on walking Keep On Walking as God reveal his ways we just need to keep walking focus on the Promises of God and say Lord I can't do anything I have done my best but I can't do anything anymore but I don't surrender I look forward to your promise I believe you Lord and move forward amen remember that Enoch walk with God and he was found not remember that walk is to agree with the word of God Amen remember when you go to a doctor for checkup maybe regular checkup the doctor will always ask you do you exercise what exercise do you have if you say no he will always advise just walk even for 30 minutes it will help you balance your blood sugar lower your cholesterol you lower your blood PR pressure and all that you do in life just walk even for 30 minutes a day remember that Enoch walk with God Amen and remember 30 minutes is the half hour silence in Revelation chapter 7 amen when you walk you are communicating with God you're just not walking and and and and thinking about your problem when you walk walk with the promises of God in your life Enoch is Walking with God he is promising God the doctor say walk even 30 minutes remember the 30 half hour of silence is the revealing of the word the coming down of God and revealing his word and we need to walk in harmony with
