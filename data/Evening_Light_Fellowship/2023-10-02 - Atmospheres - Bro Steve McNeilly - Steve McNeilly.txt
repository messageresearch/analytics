your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren so here's a reminder for the Brethren finally I've said all these things I've I've written this book but but here finally let me put you in remembrance of something whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do somebody say do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen you may take your seats this morning I would like to title my sermon this morning and speak to you on the subject of atmospheres and now we know that the atmosphere that surrounds the Earth it it holds the very air that we breathe that protects us from outer space it holds moisture the clouds the gases and tiny particles in short the atmosphere is the protective bubble in which we live so we could very clearly say that the atmosphere around the earth is extremely important to us as human beings and so it is for us as Believers the atmosphere that we carry around about us in our lives is just as important as the atmosphere is that surrounds the Earth and so without this atmosphere that surrounds the Earth we realize that this planet would not be livable if there was no atmosphere there would be no air to breathe if there was no atmosphere the gases wouldn't be held in their place if there was no atmosphere this Earth this planet Earth that we live in would not be livable and so we see that when we look at that we realize that the natural is a type of the spiritual and it's quite amazing to me that whenever you begin to look into space and you begin to look at the stars and you begin to look at the great Milky Way and all the galaxies and you see look at a flower and you wonder how it grows in the grass and how it grows and all these different things and you see the handiwork of God throughout everything that we look at and it's it's almost quite a phenomenon like there's things in space this works because of this and this goes hand in hand with this and when you really think about it as people as scientists and as human beings we really haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the handiwork of God and the things that surround us and go on in life it just absolutely blows our mind whenever we see these things and to think that the god that spoke these things into existence when we read our Bibles we read and it says and God created the heavens and the Earth and he spoke this and he spoke that but the detail that is within those verses of what actually happened is would probably blow our minds of how God created this Earth and so the same God that spoke these things into her existence the same God that that that made the earth and the galaxies and the grass and the moon and and for the tide to only come in so far and for the sun to shine and all these different things the same God that created these things is the same God who said he would be with us he's the same God he said he would be in us until the end of days the same God that created these things as the same God that says behold all I'm a friend that sticks closer than a brother her he said I will never leave you nor will I forsake you though the tides will command though the winds will blow though you'll have trials and temptations the very God the creator of the whole universe is not only with us but he is in US what a peace that should bring to us as Believers knowing that the God who created these things is with us so what is there to fear what is or to worry about well brother Stephen you don't understand my circumstance I might not but I understand the Creator God that the one who created these things is able to fix our situations my what a God we serve brother Branham said that what makes God so great is that he could make himself so little um so we realize that as God created this atmosphere around this planet Earth to make it livable and it's so important for us as Believers we can take it into our own lives and we can say this Earth let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so the atmosphere that we have surrounding Our Lives as individuals as Sons and Daughters of God is just as important that it's a good atmosphere as it is the atmosphere that surrounds the Earth amen Divine love 1957 brother Branham said now you've got to create an atmosphere he's not saying your mom and dad have to create the atmosphere he's not saying somebody else has to create the atmosphere for you but you yourself as a son or a daughter of God has got to create this atmosphere he says and your faith will do it they were all in the upper room with one Accord when suddenly there came from Heaven as a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything anything it takes an atmosphere and not just any kind of atmosphere because we'll find out that just as much as there's a good atmosphere that we love and we love being around there's also a bad atmosphere that we don't like being around so it's important for us now as Believers because brother Branham said we are little creators and what's up to us now he says you've got to create the atmosphere so the question is how do we create the atmosphere how do we create the right kind of atmosphere Hallelujah brother Branham gives us these answers I'm sure many of you have been to uh a live event before whether it was whether it was a sporting event or whether it was a concert or wherever it may be what is it that makes it so much better when you go to an event live in person it's the atmosphere what is it that makes uh what is the difference that of going to church on on a Wednesday or a Sunday and streaming it online at home it's the atmosphere the people who are watching it on their laptop or their phone or whatever it may be they'll say yeah uh that was a good service and yeah the song was okay and yeah uh it was just okay but the same people that are watching and listening to the same thing only live they're watching they're listening to the same words to the same sermon to the same song special but because they're live in person they'll say wow this service was amazing it was so good what is it that makes it so much better it's the atmosphere what is it that makes a game so much better when you go and watch the game it's the atmosphere of the people what is it that makes a concert so much better when it's live and in person it's the atmosphere understand the building is not the atmosphere whether it's an arena whether it's a concert a hall or a church the atmosphere is not created by the arena or the building but the atmosphere is created by the people so you can say I want to go to church uh uh to get into the atmosphere no as Believers we need to bring the atmosphere to the building it's the atmosphere that makes it better there's nothing better than being there live and in person so there's when you think of a sporting event and and I'm sure all of you have either been to a basketball game or volleyball or or football or whatever it may be you know the atmosphere there's a there's a greater preparation that goes into going to a sporting event than just showing up and going to the event I remember one time talking on atmospheres uh in Ireland um I was like 13 or 14 years of age and at this time the Belfast Giants they just they they built a new ice rink and uh and they got a new ice hockey team and everything I'd never been to an ice hockey game before but one thing I note about ice hockey is these guys they they get away with fighting a lot and so just as it's a man thing I guess like you just enjoy that kind of a thing and so your anticipation what you're expecting is I'm going to go to this is talking game and these guys are going to get after it it's going to be so much fun they're going to hit each other up against the side and it's just it it really gets the the Beast nature of the man riled up absolutely especially as a 14 year old and so I remember being in the arena and it was my first game that I'd ever been to and there was these two guys that were sitting next to us and and it was just so funny because you knew that I was a beginner and these guys were seasoned veteran fans they had their shirts on they had the names in the back not only did they know the name of the people on their team but they knew the names of the people on the other team so we had pretty good seats and these guys man they were just shouting you know it was all clean fun but they were just shouting stuff at the other team trying to get them all riled up and I just remember like there was no fight or anything like that but I remember that what made this um this this this this this game so much fun for me was these two other guys because they were so much fun to be around they knew their stuff the things that they were saying was pretty funny and on and on and they were the ones that made the atmosphere of my experience so much better understand the atmosphere is created by the individuals not the arena I'm gonna really clinch that nail this morning because you are the creator of the atmosphere that's set and brother Branham said that when an atmosphere anything can happen he said the right kind of atmosphere will bring the miraculous on the scene so don't be dependent upon the song leader don't be dependent upon the church building sure we believe this this the sanctuary has been Sanctified and and God is here but don't depend upon that don't depend upon the church building depend upon yourself there's nothing better than being there in person why because the atmosphere is what changes things there's nothing like being in church there's nothing like singing and worshiping with the Believers in person and in church you remember covid remember when it was just a preacher and we all had to sit at home and stream do you remember singing on your couch you remember worshiping the Lord on your couch I thought my goodness I know I Make a Joyful Noise but I didn't think it was that bad for service oh it's nice I'm singing and I realize who am I and it goes from a sing to a talk to a whisper why because the atmosphere is not the same but when you get in amongst the Believers why is it that we can worship God in a different way than we do at home it's because we all bring a certain atmosphere with us and we're not scared to shout we're not scared to hauler we're not scared to sing at the loudness of our voices why because we're putting our voice together with everybody else's voice and what is it doing it is creating an atmosphere of worship where God is pleased with it [Laughter] I'm sorry for those that sit in front of me but I like to make I like to make a Joyful Noise have you ever heard somebody sing that they make a Joyful Noise but God has placed a song in their hearts and it's touched your heart more than somebody that could sing like an angel you've got to help us you say well uh I'm not a singer that's why I've never sang a song special before it's time for you to sing a song special let me just speak from my heart a second has any of you downloaded the podcast elf podcast raise your hands do you ever notice that it's the same probably 10 people that sing well what's going on with the rest of us why is the rest of us not up here making a Joyful Noise well I'm not a singer we didn't ask you if you were a singer or not how do you know that your Joyful Noise wouldn't be a blessing to other people within the service how do you know that your Joyful Noise wouldn't be a blessing to somebody listening to that podcast Hallelujah well I don't have a song in my heart I hear that a lot I hear it from from the ones that enjoy singing have a gift well I want to wait brother I want to wait until God really put something on my heart you know how long I would be waiting to preach huh somebody oh I'm just waiting brother Ron I can't this month Wednesday night no I don't have anything what do you think we have to do as a Ministry we've got to Humble ourselves we've got to get on our knees we've got to sensitize ourselves we've got to say father give me something for the people give me something that might help them in their lives what about you that sing father I have a gift of song I have a gift of ministry put a song on my heart that the people might be blessed because the gift is not for the person that has it it's for the people so stop holding yourself back and stop worrying what other people will think about it who cares what anybody thinks about it just do it for the Lord amen there's a saying amongst the young people and they like to say that was hype oh we went there this past week it was hype or I'm going to go over there in the next couple of weeks guess what it's going to be hype and what does hype mean I guess it's gonna it means it's going to be cool it was awesome it was great it was fantastic it was so hype oh I can't wait was hype what makes it so hype when you're going to say I can't wait to go to that event it's going to be hype what are you doing in that specific time that you're saying that you're hyping up the event so the atmosphere of the event doesn't just happen at the time of the event but it happens the week leading up to the event it happens that two weeks leading up to the event it happens when you buy your tickets for the event you ever seen somebody at an event that's unhappy doesn't happen why is that because they pay for their tickets I wonder if we had to pay to come to church if you have to pay to get the seat that you like within the assembly guy guess what everybody that's there would want to be there because they don't want to waste their money Hallelujah you should give an offering an extra offering and say I'm paying for this church service today um this isn't a call for money I'm just going with it but if you were to pay for it you would enter into the service a little more if you were to pay for it there would be a different atmosphere leading up to the service a lot of people what do they do oh I'm going to the ball game I can't wait Sports Radio what are we doing when we listen to sports radio you're hyping yourself up for the event oh this guy over here and this quarterback and he's got this and he's got that and this one's got this and and this team against this team and and the last time they met and all the time you're listening to it what are you doing you're you're hyping yourself up you're getting energized about it you're you're looking up stats about uh players you're looking up this about the team you're looking up that about the team you're looking up of where your seat is going to be in the arena and you're thinking wow this is going to be so much fun I can't wait to get to the game this week I wonder now and I'm gonna go back and forth because some of you are catching that I'm going to use the natural and spiritual type and some of you aren't and so what about church what would happen if we would or take the the three or four days before the service and go my goodness church is going to be so hype I'm listening to sermons I'm reading my Bible I'm praying it's going to be so much fun it's going to be so good be the atmosphere is going to be electric and God is going to move in the scene you say well why do you believe that because I believe where two or more are gathered in his name that God is going to be in the midst I'm not just going to go to church for the sake of going to church but I'm going to meet God and when I meet God my life is not going to be the same gonna be so good it's going to be such an awesome service not because of the person that's preaching but because you're going with the intent to meet God almighty makes all the difference so everyone so they're listening to listening to talk radio and listening to this and these two teams and what's it doing it's it's getting yourself built up for this event that's laying ahead Hallelujah now what happens you're getting all built up and you're so excited and you're thinking my goodness I can't wait I sure hope we win when you go to church you don't have to hope that you're going to win because we have already won he has already overcame and so those who go to church guess what we are winners we are not people who hope but we are a people of faith we don't have to hope that God is going to move in our lives but by faith we say father I'm coming with the right attitude I'm coming with the right motive I know you're going to meet me we find out that whenever you're going to an event you don't leave five minutes before the event starts nah you're up early you're making sure everything's ready everything's prepared your shirt with your favorite ball player's name in the back of it is iron to a crisp you got your lunch made up you got your Waters you get all these things you're checking the traffic you're saying because I don't want to get there late I don't want to just get there on time in case I miss something but I want to get there early and I want to make sure that I get my seat and I want to make sure this and I want to make sure that there's the preparation that goes into it because you're excited what about church we'd only just want to get here on time no I want to get here early I want to make the right preparations to make sure that I'm not late to church that I do get my seat that my heart that I do have time to pray and seek God and get my spirit and my heart settled if we're doing it in the natural why aren't we doing it in the spiritual oh God help us it's because we're putting a priority on other things instead of the things of God but if we were to put a priority on the things of God oh let me tell you there would be an atmosphere where Miracles would happen there would be an atmosphere where people would be delivered where people would be set free an atmosphere where these these Devils that have tormented you all week long they wouldn't stand a chance what's another thing that you do leading up to a game he talked to people about it oh I can't wait it's gonna be so much fun did you get your thing booked you're going as well nice nice oh what about this what about that and you're talking and you're fellowshipping one with another about the game why because you're excited about it you're excited about the event you're excited about the concert but yet when it comes time for church oh my there's not a word said sometimes I don't want to use the word hyping it up but there's no hype up for church there's no encouraging each other for church there's no talking about the word with each other in Fellowship about church but yet we come and we expect God to move a lot of times we call them with the wrong atmosphere around us and we're expecting God to do things in our lives now I am so glad that God does not always just depend upon us and about what we have to do to get into the right conditions He's So Graceful gracious and graceful and all those different things that by the washing of the water of the word sure he cleanses us sure he washes us and he does those things for us that we do not deserve but if we were to put a little bit of effort into it Hallelujah so when we're getting ready to go throughout the week what are we doing we are creating an atmosphere an atmosphere of excitement a night atmosphere of electricity that you're wanting your team to win so bad that it's all we want to talk about it's all we want to do and all it's going to be so exciting that when you get to the arena it seems like the atmosphere is just out of this world understand when the arena is empty there's no atmosphere there it's dead there's nothing there there's no noise there's no excitement there's no there's no pumping up there's no hyping it up there's none of these things if you went to the same Arena the next day it wouldn't have the same effect as it did while everybody was there why because you've got thousands upon thousands of people that are doing the exact same thing that you are doing throughout the week getting ready for the game and what does it do when they all get together with that atmosphere it changes things it changes the atmosphere and then you go wow what an event wow that was amazing how good was that why because of the atmosphere further Ezra just came up and sat up front why he's changing the atmosphere I wonder why we said nobody sits on the front rows and we all want to sit in the back because we got a wrong kind of atmosphere but if we would get in the right kind of atmosphere and come to church with an expectation things would change if we would put the same kind of effort into going to church as we do and other things that we do God would have a special move amongst us so just think you've got all these people as individuals are doing their part for their team and they're all coming together in one Accord they're in one place and they are in one Accord and they're hoping for the same thing the disciples at the day of Pentecost they were in one place in one Accord under an expectation and under a promise of God that he would tarry ye in Jerusalem until you are endued with power they had a promised word for their day and so they were waiting upon that power they didn't know what it was going to do they didn't know what it was going to bring forth he just said Terry ye and when it comes you'll know when it comes we don't have to make believe stuff oh I felt a little something I wonder was that was that God oh I heard this I wonder was that God when God speaks to our hearts when God touches your life there's no I wondering about it you know that from that time God spoke to my heart and something changed so if we would all as individuals now come together doing our part throughout the week and we're doing this and we're praying and we're sensitizing ourselves when we come into the church as individuals with an atmosphere of God I may bring it all together as a collective body can you imagine one Accord not bickering and fighting and all that stuff with each other no one Accord remember the building or the arena is not the place with the atmosphere but the arena or the building is waiting for you to bring the atmosphere to the place Hallelujah that's why it's so important for us as Sons and Daughters of God to go to church expecting not going to church and just sit there and say well ah I wonder how it will be today I wonder who's going to preach today because brother Ron's not met I wonder I wonder no you'll go to church with an expectation because you've been building it throughout the entire week and you're not just waiting to sit down and say well God go ahead and bless me because I need blessed God can bless us throughout the entire week the atmosphere is what changes things in our lives 1956 the supernatural brother Branham says and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of God Among the people it's the atmosphere of it's not the atmosphere of the building it's not the atmosphere of the church but the atmosphere of the people is what brings them miraculous designs and the Wonders it's the atmosphere that brings the Deliverance Hallelujah now mix the atmosphere with the word go ahead and mix the word with faith go ahead and mix your faith with a little bit of Godly atmosphere there ain't no devil can stand in our way so the right kind of atmosphere among the people will change things in our lives and it will bring the miraculous it's just like a game you ever been to a game and your team's losing and it seems like uh they can't get off the back foot they're always on the back foot the ball's a hot potato they can't catch anything to save their lives and and here it is it's a really really tight game but all of a sudden the people get involved all of a sudden there's there's a Mexican wave starts all of a sudden they begin to sing the national anthem of the team I don't know any American national anthems whatever I just know rugby the World Cup is going on right now Ireland are doing really good might be the first time that they ever win a World Cup and so what happens when they're on the back foot the people all linked together Soldier disorder together standing strong my see these guys and make the hairs in the back of your neck stand up what do you think it does for the people the players all of a sudden they're on the back foot but their team begins to get around them there's a Mexican wave they begin to sing they begin to sing the national anthem and all of a sudden the tides turn why are the tides turning it's called home field advantage because it does something to the players they're thinking my all these people are here they're standing shoulder to shoulder they're standing with me they're joining in with song how can we stay in this position that we're in let's play a little bit harder all of a sudden they drop into gear and they're no longer on the back foot but the tides change so it is with church sometimes you might think we're on the back foot but hey we need to get together once in a while you need to tell your pastor that you love them and that you appreciate them you need to get together and sing the songs of Zion what does it do it brings a courage a courage bold a courage bold to fight the good fight of faith a courage bold to stand strong to stand upon your convictions to stand upon the word of God whether anybody believes you or not why because the people got involved Hallelujah an amen does a preacher the world of good yeah I felt good brother Paul thank you I'll say it over here and amen to the preacher does them the world of good hmm that felt good it doesn't matter how they feel in their body at that point they might be tired of morale and all these different things but when the people join together it kicks them in to another gear and some of us sitting here this morning you might be in the uh goal line defense whatever it might be you might be in the last minutes of your game you might be feeling tired wore out battle worn but guess what there's people here that love you and God is here to encourage you this morning that's the reason that I love going to church it's a time where we can just come and shut off the things of louder you see it because guess what this is what I say to myself when I leave the church building this morning the same issues that you got the same troubles guess what work is still going to be there that text message that you got before service about work it's still going to be there it's only a two-hour stretch it's not going to change anything worrying about it in the church service so I love to come to church because it's a time just to shut off from now do you see it it's a time to shut off from the trials and the troubles and all those different things and just say father this is my time with you Hallelujah leave it at the door because when you leave I'm sure it'll be waiting for you at the door again they kind of make us want to sit a little while longer after service wouldn't it if we were to say oh my my troubles are I'm not really thinking about them too much right now but when I leave they're still going to be there I'm going to sit and I'm going to worship for a little while longer I'm going to sit and I'm just going to pray for a little while after service why because I don't want to go back to that just yet I want to stay in his presence amen the supernatural 1956 brother Brown says and it's the atmosphere that brings in miraculous and wonders and powers of God Among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place their reasoning notice this and wandering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and they don't know where they do stand half of them not even Spirit scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be right so he says when they're stewing when they're wandering when they're reasoning and thinking and all tore up I wonder how many of us this morning came to church reasoning Upon Our Hearts I wonder how many of us came to church having a stew within our family before service they don't know what stewing means arguing fighting bickering not homemade stew that you eat we're stewing we're arguing ah but yet come to church and want the right atmosphere brother brownham said it won't create the right atmosphere he says all tore up you can't expect it no you can't it won't be right listen this is phenomenal it's got to be in one Accord one place and settle down with one motive one thing then you're going to see something happen when they were in one place in one Accord the word of God was fulfilled in the book of Acts it don't only work that but if you'd look at it in the scientific World say you're all a whole bunch of salesmen and you're going to sell Chevrolets or Pontiacs or some kind of a car and the one in his heart really thinks the dude Bakers is that a car huh it is I might show them my age right now are better and so forth like that I bet you that's when cars before they even had seat belts huh crank this thing up here get us all in here and saying the Buick is best and the other one some other car get us together like that you could never have the right kind of a meeting taking in the devil's work go over and say we're we're going to a dance one man stand up saying well he don't know about whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over she and she and the music playing near to God near my God to thee huh what an atmosphere for a dance well that's not any different than what a lot of atmospheres you go into church for service of God just to contrary right what's he saying you go to a dance and you're expecting the dance music and all these different things and they begin playing near my God to thee it doesn't belong that kind of music doesn't belong at the dances and he says you go into some church services and he says it's quite the contrary where you're expecting a song like near my God to thee and all of a sudden it's a rock concert it's dance music it's it's wooky Boogie music whatever it may be he says quite the contrary it shouldn't be there it's the wrong kind of atmosphere I feel like we're depending upon the wrong kind of music that brings that kind of atmosphere into our churches when it doesn't belong there Hallelujah he says well let's well that's not any different than a bunch of church service for a service of God just the contrary right the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dance is to put on your old music that makes dances and everybody get thinking what a good time they're going to have dancing and so forth and they'll be having a big whooping time first of all they think about it what are they doing they're they're preparing themselves for the dance and when the dance finally comes they have a whoop upping time why because they've prepared themselves for it read between the lines put the right kind of a music on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there and going to meet everything that they have need of something will go to taking place atmosphere but that's the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get people in that atmosphere notice not an atmosphere of whoop upping and and having a boogie woogie time but an atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing the atmosphere of believing comes with the atmosphere of worship and the atmosphere of worship comes with the right attitude it comes with the right preparation it comes with the right music being played Hallelujah and it comes with the right life being lived by the people amen atmospheres he said and that's the reason paragraph 23 sometimes the Divine Life that's been called and set aside has become a fanatic or crazy or Mystic or something to the eyes of the general public is because you're considered I'd say an erotic or an insane person is because that you have changed your dwelling place and got into a different atmosphere and let me just say this as it as it comes to me you know loudi Asia has its own atmospheres but we as Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not no longer we should not be no longer in the atmosphere of laodiacia we should not be no longer in the atmosphere of the man anointing but the bride has come up a little bit higher the anointing has taken us out of ladies and the chaos of ladies here and to the anointing or the atmosphere or the inspiration of the eagle brother Branham says that eagle is a special bird he said he can fly way higher into the atmospheres than any other bird that there is why because he's especially built bird who is bestly designed for higher atmospheres and higher altitudes so is the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] were built for Higher Ground we're built for higher atmospheres we're built for uh uh a higher revelation of the word that's why you catch it not because you've heard it multiple times before but you catch it in your heart because you've been designed to catch it and hold it in your heart amen he says you've changed your dwelling place and got into a different atmosphere notice what it's going to do to you when that happens when you change your Dwelling Place into a different atmosphere people are going to say you're a neurotic people are going to say you're crazy people gonna say you're far out people are going to say this you're a Holy Roller whatever it might be why because you've changed your atmosphere he says in your one motive your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere my once you get into the the higher calling of Christ and once we get into that higher atmosphere where all things are possible our desire and our motives is to always get back to that spot you have experiences with God huh God moves on your heart supernaturally it's a special time between you and God and after that time you always our desires as Believers is to go back I want it to happen again I want it to happen again I want it to happen again and as long as our lives are right I believe that it will happen again he said any person that ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else you can't satisfy the thirst for God with worldly things it's never going to happen so you might as well just stop it you might as well just stop searching for it on the internet you might as well just stop searching for it maybe if I listen to this preacher or if I listen to that preacher or or if I go over here maybe that'll be no that's not it Hallelujah nothing else will ever satisfy and that's why I believe that we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost that men and women in their work and wherever they should be should continually desire and they will if they've ever once come into that atmosphere I want to ask you what is it that keeps you coming back to church what is it that keeps you coming back to God because you're searching for that atmosphere you're searching for that special something you might walk away for a little while you might make wrong choices and wrong decisions but what is it that brings you always back to the house of God let me tell you it's not your family if it was your family you would just come and go and come and go when the family asks you to come and go but when you come to the house of God what is it that brings a person back and that they stay in the house in the presence of God is because that atmosphere that you are craving and it's that atmosphere that you're wanting God to speak to your heart Hallelujah I remember when I first got converted and give my heart to the Lord and everything and and uh you know you think it's hard being a sinner oh once you become a Christian now you get all sorts of troubles got all sorts of tempting you got all sorts of people pulling you all over the place here and there and everywhere and you're thinking my goodness but there's something that's within us there was something that that was within me that that that that I wanted more understand if there's a craving for more of God there's more of God for you it's a deep that's calling to the Deep and I can say this it wasn't it wasn't Rocco that kept me going back to church though I loved him and though I worked with them every day and and he was one of my best friends but it wasn't because of him that kept me going back it was because of God and I knew it was real and I knew that I wanted more Vincent it's not because of brother Amos that you keep coming to church otherwise when he's not here you wouldn't be here Zach same thing it's not because of brother Amos that you're maybe it started that way but there's something that's drawing you it's a deep that's calling to the Deep you might under might not understand what it is but it's God it's God dealing with your heart it's God bringing you to the church it's God that's that's pulling you and wanting you and drawing something out of you that's making you want to serve him it's not a man how about that God the creator of all the universe draws us and he pulls us out of the muck in the Mary clay because he wants Fellowship one-on-one personally with us as Believers my goodness what a God we serve what a wonderful God he is all because he wants Fellowship this isn't the work of a man God young people you think you're here well just because my family's here and I go to church it's wrong God's drawing you God's working on your life God's working on your hearts Hallelujah think well if you have the attitude I go just because Mom and Dad go wrong attitude but you can't stand the presence of God and something not happened that little hen a little egg brother Brown talks about him the little eagle a little and that thing cracks what happened said put that thing under a different atmosphere is it it it it it births it right and he says that little that little chicken egg or whatever it is he goes put it under a puppy what'll happen it'll be birthed because it's under the right atmosphere some of you think you just come to church because of whatever and it's not because of God yeah you're still in your shell man but just watch you get under the right atmosphere you'll be birthed it'll be hard any birth is messy you gotta pick your own way out of it say well why does nobody it's hard why won't nobody pray for me yeah because God's working on you some of us are have a harder shell than others and you've got to pick for a little while longer but when you're in the right atmosphere you're going to pick your own way out of your shell and when you do you know it's going to be real Hallelujah atmospheres change things I think it's important for us has families heads of the homes to realize that we are atmosphere Setters in our homes there's a quote it's probably for next service but there's a quote where brother Brown's talking about uh forget who it was but their son didn't turn out right he said yeah I think it was Jezebel their family was cursed he said how can you expect a family that's cursed for their kids to come out right he said they're under the wrong atmosphere wonder how many of us have the wrong atmosphere in our homes and we bring our kids to Sunday school we bring our kids to youth meetings bring our kids to church we expect to minister and the youth leaders to take care of her kids how can you expect that to happen when the atmosphere at home is wrong but if we were to take it upon ourselves and say you know what maybe this is because of me maybe I've set the wrong atmosphere in my home maybe I've set the wrong priorities in my home and maybe this is because of me as the head of my house I've made wrong decisions and this is my fault first step is good recognize that it's your fault no as a man what do we do we fix things so now we fix it we're creators made in the image of God so maybe the atmosphere is wrong but from this point forth we can change it and when we change the atmospheres guess what there's a change I'm coming amen so we realize that there's a right kind of atmosphere and there's also a wrong kind of atmosphere that as Believers we can carry with us the wrong kind of atmosphere is that of fussing fussing and reasoning and envying one another wandering and stewing and all these different things that we can get so easily caught up with as believers understand that we fight against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness against against all these different unseen forces that's coming against us as Believers and they want to use our family against us they want to turn us against one another and I want to say Lord help us to realize the issues and to take care of it and if that means for one of us to truly humble ourselves and say we're sorry for something that you don't even think you were wrong in that's what we got to do takes Holy Ghost Revelation to do that because you're no longer thinking about ourselves but we're thinking of the outcome of what it's going to produce Hallelujah that's beautiful amen amen 1963 is your life worthy of the gospel and did you know you are a little Creator yourself you know that certainly you've seen people that just love that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind there you like to be around them they create atmosphere listen to this by the life that they live the way they walk and their conversation so how do they create an atmosphere around them that makes other people want to be around them it's because of the life they live it's because of of the way they talk and their conversation it creates the right kind of attitude right kind of atmosphere then you've seen those that every time you shun them all time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody not anybody in elf I would assume say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere you ever had that person or multiple people in your life and all they want to do is is find the bad and everything all they want to do is talk about this person all they want to do is talk about and you see them coming and you think oh my goodness here they come what is it going to be today same thing as last week oh my same thing as the week before and they create this atmosphere around them that though they're nice people though they're Believers within the assembly though you love them because they're your brother and sister in the Lord there's just something that you wanna arm's length what is it that makes us feel that way about certain people it's the atmosphere that they have created around them and how have they created this Atmosphere by the things that they're thinking on how to criticize and the bad and everything and this that and the other the things that they do the actions the things that they're talking about these things all mixed together it has created an atmosphere around this individual and guess what where none of us can point fingers because at certain times in our lives guess what we are that individual if the musicians would come we'll bring this to a close brother Branham said that the right kind of atmosphere will bring the miraculous on the scene so the question is this for us as Believers how do we get ourselves into the right kind of atmosphere it starts with our opening scripture Philippians 4 verse 8. finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure these things are a sermon within themselves the whatsoevers is a sermon within itself and how to create the right kind of atmosphere around us as believers whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise these are the things to think on but yet and louder you see her we get caught up with the complete opposite we get caught up with whatsoever things are bad we get caught up in wandering into other people's business and and how their life is going we get caught up with this that and the other we get caught up with listening to the wrong kind of voices and the wrong kind of music and the wrong kind of this and we get so caught up with these things that without even realizing it we're creating an atmosphere around us that people don't want to be around so it all starts with the mind it starts with the greatest battle that's been ever fought the things that we're thinking on it's so easy for us to get caught up with the carnality of our Humanity that we forget to look at the positive we forget to look at the virtue we forget to look at the things that are lovely we forget to look at the things of a good report something of a virtue we pass over it to look at the ugly the things that are true we pass it over and we look at the opposite it starts with our mind and it goes from our mind to our mouth because he is the high priest of our confession and so now what starts in our mind it goes into our mouth and what comes out of our mouth those are the things Jesus said that defiles a man when it comes out of the mouth now it's it's already in our hearts because as a man thinketh in his heart so he is and so when a man is thinking about all these uh impurities and and and and the things that are opposite to what we have just read guess what happens now our heart becomes contaminated though we're still a believer though we're still seed this is spiritual warfare and it comes from our hearts and it goes out our mouths and when we say something typically we believe it or we wouldn't say it and it goes from our mouth now to our lives and now all of a sudden our lives and the atmosphere around us is so contaminated and it's so filthy and it's so caught up with the things of this world it's so caught up with the things it brings a bad atmosphere that guess what all of a sudden now we're way out left field when we should be playing tightly together like a softball team there they got that group there and they got that the core group there that's in the middle they're like well why is this guy way out left field he's supposed to be playing shortstop what's he doing there he's way out there he's out of position he's not called to be out there he should be here how did he get out there how did she get out there how did I get out there Lord how am I so far out in my life how have I got this bad attitude how have I got this Aura and atmosphere around me that that nobody wants to be around [Music] because I've been giving myself to the wrong things I've been given my thoughts to the wrong things I've been giving my eyes to the wrong things been given my ears to the wrong things and before we know it now it's just snowballed and wow here I am here I am here you are here you are here you are what are you going to do about it [Music] yeah you're caught out left field you shouldn't be out there you're out of place okay here we are here I am I'm playing out of position I've been feasting on the wrong things I've

went forth this morning now it's up to you now it's up to you as an individual now it's up to you as a husband as a wife as a son or as a daughter yeah caught in the wrong position from plan where you shouldn't be playing what are you gonna do about it what are you gonna do about it boys You're Gonna Stay playing in the wrong position if you play in the wrong position you'll never be come to your full potential never but when you find yourself in the wrong spot in the wrong position at the wrong place at the wrong time and on and on and on you have a choice to make we have choices of us Believers and we can say I can either stay here in my misery I can either put my I can put my hands in my head and I can go oh my I feel sorry for myself and just stay here or I can do something about it ball is in your court this morning if you've been caught out left field if you've been caught out where you shouldn't be in your walk with Christ has absolutely nothing to do with the seed that lays within you just made wrong choices if you find yourself in that position this morning it's a very good time to do something about let's pray Heavenly Father Lord not expecting the service to end this way but yet here we are we're calling Lord to attention and perhaps father some have found themselves Lord playing it in a position where they shouldn't be playing doing things that they shouldn't be doing thinking things that they shouldn't be thinking speaking things they shouldn't be spanking think speaking and acting hell we shouldn't be acting as believers but father God you always give warning before judgment and I believe you're warning us this morning that now the ball is in our core now it's up to us father to do something about it Lord God I pray that by the Holy Spirit you would Quicken hearts and that you would change lives Lord that you would change directions in which people are walking in and let it be for thy Kingdom's Glory father as every head is bowed this morning and every eye is closed perhaps you've found yourself in a position that you know you shouldn't be in you're not walking accordingly to the things that Paul said those things that you see and you've heard in me these things I want you to do them if you found yourself in that position this morning how about you raise your hand God sees those hands God knows your heart God sees where you're at he knows [Music] I want to say God bless you and as God is moving upon your heart and as we sing this morning I want you to make things right between you and God you say father yeah I've been caught out here I'm not doing what I should be doing please forgive me from this time forth get back into your position something that's very personal between you and God it's not between you and a man it's not something you have to confess to a high priest but he is the high priest of our confession he is our mediator he's the only one that you have to bring these things to father now you saw the hands and you saw the heart and the life behind it I ask Lord you would intervene now father from this time forth that we would be in our rightful positions in Christ we love you in Jesus Christ
