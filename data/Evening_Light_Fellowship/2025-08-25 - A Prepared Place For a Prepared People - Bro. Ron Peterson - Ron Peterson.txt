[Music] And every need you need, he's already [Music] every promise you can claim. This is what you got to do. Just ask it in his name. everything you need. He's already providing. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that this morning we have several needs that we'd like to mention this morning. First, a praise report. Brother Russell Wallace sent me a text this morning. Asked me to read an update from his doctor's visit. This is Friday. He says, "I went to the doctor this morning for a pathology report. I have a perfect report. The doctor uh had taken out a bunch of the closest lymph nodes and had them biopsied once again looking for anything that might have spread. Nothing zero zil total deliverance from the Lord. And I'm thanking the Lord for that. We rejoice with brother Russell this morning. We rejoice with him and his guiding the surgeon's hand and touching him and removing all the cancer that was in his prostate. So we thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have several need. We have three needs written down this morning. Uh we ask brother Pierre Verquest if he will come and take our needs to the Lord today. He has a testimony from unanswered prayer that he would like to testify this morning. My mother-in-law, Barb, sister Barbara Yarro, she's here today and she has a request today. It says, "Please pray for my youngest son, Joseph. He has some medical issues and he doesn't want to have any more tests. However, the di diagnosis that he has conditioned is requiring a PET scan. It's a PET scan. At this time, Joseph says he doesn't want to get one. Please pray for Joseph that he'll change his mind and he can get this diagnosis. Thank you much, Sister Barbara Yro. So, let's remember our son Joseph this morning. We want to remember the saints that are traveling. There's quite a few saints that are traveling. Sister Ramona Aldco says, "Please remember my son-in-law, Dwayne." Dwayne will be having surgery on Wednesday to remove a new cancer growth. I'm asking God to be with Dwayne and to guide the doctor's hands. Also, prayer for Vanessa, his wife, and their kids for God to help them through this trial. And also Dwayne's mother, her name is Pat. This has been very hard on all of them. So, let's remember them this morning. Do you have a need today that you'd like to present to him one more time as brother Pierre comes? He's already provided. Lift your need and sing. He's already proided. [Music] He's already proided. Every name you need, he's already proided. Every promise you can claim, every proise you can claim, just ask it in his name. Everything you need, he's already provided. God bless you saints. I had uh a little testimony to my wife and my sister went to Mexico about uh about 3 weeks now. Um a couple things happened there and then and I just wanted to give God the glory. Just wanted to start with the quick scripture here. Matthew 10:32. So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I will acknowledge before my father who is in heaven. So I believe, you know, we shouldn't hold these testimonies to ourselves. And um hopefully it's edifying for you. And um so just to make it brief, there's a lot of details, so I'll make it short, but uh so about a week, 3 weeks last Wednesday, uh her uncle was really sick. Uh they didn't give him much time. Doctors pretty much gave up on him. uh a lot of complications, a lot of water in his body and his uh heart had enlarged so they didn't give him much time. So, she left that weekend um after the prayer request and um uh when she got there um it was uh I think it was Saturday uh no Sunday sorry Sunday night she got there and um he was already feeling a lot better almost 50% better um just because of your prayers and uh so he's she's been testifying to his uh to her um aunt and and her uncle about the message and so little by little they've been accepting it and um so I believe there's a work being done there. So just keep praying for them. Um that's one testimony. The second one is the one that really is a miracle. Um so before she left, you know, we always check the car, check the water, the fluids, and everything, and she just got uh we put new tires on her vehicle just to get there cuz you know, Mexico, you got to make sure you know your tires are good. So um there's a lot of debris, a lot of potholes, and a lot of stuff. even though they re revamped the streets and the highways are they're better now but so about 7 hours from Ngalas into you know south Mexico there so that's how far her that little town is so um while she got there you know they so it was about that Monday they were they got there um and then Thursday all till Thursday there was a an issue with the higher. And the way it started was that they had gone to another little town where some of her family members were there and she visit them and on the way back coming to the town where her uncle's at uh there was uh they they hit a pothole and uh and noticed that tire pressure had gone down a couple pounds and so that was just an indication that hey, you know, maybe something happened to the tire. Um, and it was only the one tire. And as they got there, they went um they told my brother-in-law, he's he lives there as well. And uh they went to the tire shop and found a nail on that tire. Um, and what the miracle is that when the tire man took the tire, it was already missing one lug nut and there was only four left. And when he went to go get the tire just to put the tool on it, the four lug nuts fell to the ground. So, it's a miracle that tire stayed on all that time. Um, uh, so he got in there, he he took the nail out. And the other miracle thing is that the the the nail was not punctured all the way into the tire. It was just it could folded upon itself and the head of the nail just slightly punctured the tire just enough so it could drop a couple pounds. And and how mindful Lord is to to tell you, "Hey, look at this tire because you're going to have to tie it down." you know, uh, and the tires, they just lightly patched it as good. They put it back on and and, uh, went checked all the other lug nuts. Um, but that's just a miracle that that tire did not fall off. You know, loaded vehicle, winding roads, potholes, you know, speed bumps. Um, so I just want to give God the glory. Uh, and and for anyone, you know, just he's mindful of us, you know, and and sometimes we wonder if he's with us and and he is. And especially if you bring him first in prayer and we pray diligently before she left um that God would take care of the car and take care of the tires and take care. It's very important saints. Um bring it bring it to him and he will he will guide you. His angels will be there to keep that tire in place. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So we just want to give God the glory and thank you for your prayers. She she wanted to tell you guys, sister Naomi that thank you for the prayers for her uncle. And actually yesterday he got a she got a call that he's actually standing up now. So So, well, he was bed he was bedritten. So, so just keep keep them in prayer and we thank you for your prayers. God bless you. Oh, we're going to pray. So, let's pray for this. Uh, yeah. God be glory. Okay, let's pray. Lord, heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for allowing us to come this morning, Lord, and gather together, Lord. We're just so thankful of the things you're doing in our lives, Lord, and and how you show yourself present to us. And even though sometimes we we don't feel you, Lord, and sometimes we wonder, Lord, but you come and and you do something like this, Lord, and you just say, "I'm with you to the end of the world. I'm there. I'm protecting you guys. I'm protecting you." And so, we're just so we're so thankful, Lord. And we don't have words to say how how how we love you, Lord, and that you're doing these things. And we pray, Lord, that you would be with each and every one of these needs that are here. Brother Russell, Lord, and how you've uh cleared him up, too, Lord, to glorify you, Lord, and how how we bring you bring these needs to you, Lord. And you're just granting them, Lord. We just thank you for that, Lord. And you're mindful of your saints, Lord. We just ask for the ones that are traveling, Lord. Be with them, Lord. And as we know, it's very important that we we pray, Lord, for these things and uh bring it to you, Lord, and you're mindful and and you will deliver, Lord. So, we just want to say thank you for this uh this word that's going to come forth. We just pray you'd walk these aisles and touch the hearts, Lord, and glorify and help us, Lord, and uh just be with the with the musicians, the song leader, and all the offices in the church, Lord.

I think it's in here. Here it is. They have named their new little one Lucy Rose. Lucy means light. Rose of course comes from the rose of Sharon. Then he wrote uh the scripture Psalms 127:es 3 and 4 says, "Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of the youth. But you needed to put in there, blessed is the man who has his quiver full. &gt;&gt; We didn't put it in. &gt;&gt; You did. So there might be more coming. Eh, your quiver, huh? &gt;&gt; Never say never. &gt;&gt; He said never say never. Yeah, we've we've said that before. Anyway, isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Gives us these little love gifts. And so, here we have Lucy Rose. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You guys want to see her? Is that yours, sis? Huh? Yeah. All right, let's pray. Bow your heads with me. Kind heavenly father, as I hold in my arms Lucy Rose, her name means light, for her father is the father of light. She is a child of light and rose meaning from the rose of Sharon. Father I thank you for Lucy Rose for her life. We know that she was planned before the foundation of the world and here she is now manifested in a physical form. You knew the day and the hour in which she would be born. You knew the trials she would go through. You knew the things that she would do and the things she would experience. So I'm asking, Father, you that are the director of our life and the author and finisher of our faith. I pray now that you will receive Lucy Rose McNeely back unto you for a life of service. as we dedicate her to you that you might father receive glory and honor in all that she does and say and may she know you &gt;&gt; in the power of your resurrection. &gt;&gt; I pray now, Father, as I bless Lucy Rose, I pray that you will be with her. Touch her little body, Father. Keep her healthy and happy, strong. father. May she be a blessing to her family, to her sisters and brothers, and may they watch over her as their little baby sister. Father, I thank you and I praise you. I bless now Lucy Rose McNeely for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I always get nervous in that transition right there. Whoa. Bless you. Let me Let me shake all everybody's hands here. I bless you. Bless you. Bless you. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love the McNeely family. All of the families God's given us here at the church. Amen. I had one other announcement I wanted to say and also to um brother Neil M. It's been two years and five months since he has been unable to attend to the church and be the guy to unlock and come and do everything that he had done so fa faithfully for years. He is now back at his post of duty and he's doing that. Stand up, brother Neil. God bless you. Love you, buddy. Did you get your new set of prosthetic legs? You did. They're there. Okay, that's good deal. Uh he said they're supposed to be better than the first ones that he got and stuff. But I wanted to say also to a as a request from the pastor to all of you parents and the little children, there's been several times in uh our children, you know, they just they they're they're so lively and everything and they love to just kind of get out and run around and chase one another, but they do that among the the elders and have almost knocked over brother Neil a time or two. And uh uh so I want you to be extremely aware now young people, little ones, listen to brother Ron. Uh do your running on the grass. Not among the elders. I would not want of our older sisters. It's happened to several of our uh older sisters here too and older brothers. said, uh, as you get older, you get a little more unsure of yourself and and you know, you make sure that you watch every step. I do that now. You know, I I was getting off of the ferry and you go down the steps in the little ramp and I'm watching every step because I don't want to miss that one step. So anyway, just a note to all of you, would you please be very mindful of our elders and the different ones, all of us, okay? That uh we'll watch our children and we'll make sure that they can play on the grass and um all of that. So I appreciate it and uh Amen. Now, the Lord's been dealing with me. was up in Canada and uh Alaska and in prayer and meditation one morning. It it's just come very very strong in my heart of what I'll be preaching this morning. And u I'm not finished with the warfare of the end time at Laiusa. I will launch off into that in the next service or two. But uh the Lord was dealing on my heart and I in fellowship with the brethren up there in Canada. We were just fellowshipping. I said God dealt with me and I said uh uh I want to I says when I get back home I said I want to preach on this and when I told him that uh I felt his presence. &gt;&gt; He just came sweetly by. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love his presence? Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love it that when you make mention of him and you just feel that sweet presence? &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together this morning if you would. &gt;&gt; He's all I need. &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; is all I need. Yes, he's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is all I need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I need. Heavenly Father, now as we come to this portion of the service and we open up your holy scriptures, we would ask Father for a divine anointing, an inspiration that would come from on high. And I would ask Lord Jesus that you would show us another great portion of the great plan of redemption. And Father, I thank you that thou has prepared a place and a people to go to a place for you're a Jehovah Gyra God. You're the one that provides all our needs. &gt;&gt; So we rest in that. We have assurance this morning that you have prepared a place for a people and we thank you for that. Father, I pray now that you will bless your word. Speak to our hearts as only you can. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around, shake somebody's hand, and say, "God bless you." Yes. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you musicians each and everyone. Song specials were great. The Baya family. Amen. Brother Jean Pierre comes all the way here. Jean Pierre, God bless you. 60 years old. His family up here and and uh singing. I appreciate that. Amen. And u also we have two Johnny Greens here. We have one Johnny Green back there and we have one Johnny Green up here. and he's on the front row and his daughter is here uh with him. And God bless you, Johnny, you and your daughters. Good to have you here with us. Amen. How many of you are excited for uh the ministry of the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because that's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Because what you've done out there and all week and the money you've made and all that, that's okay. That's good. But what you do in here has eternal ramifications. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mal Malachi 3. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And verse one. And then we'll go to Isaiah chapter 40. Then we'll go to John chapter 14. Amen. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Malachi 3 and verse one. Behold, I will send my messenger, &gt;&gt; and he shall prepare the way before me, &gt;&gt; and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, &gt;&gt; even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Turn with me back to the book of Isaiah. Isaiah chapter 40 verses 3-5. &gt;&gt; We know there are types and shadows all through the scriptures. And we see that God always uses messengers. &gt;&gt; He sends angels. &gt;&gt; He sends messengers. It's extremely important &gt;&gt; to recognize your day and its message. &gt;&gt; Good to see what God has done. &gt;&gt; Good to see what God will do. &gt;&gt; But what is most important is see what God is doing. A current God &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 40:es 3 through 5. The voice of him that crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all the flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. the voice of him that crith in the wilderness. When they asked John when he came, they said, "Are you he?" &gt;&gt; "Are you the one?" He said, "No." &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Then tell us who you are that we might give an account to those who sent us." He said, "I'm the voice &gt;&gt; of one crying in the wilderness." &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; what he did, he identified his ministry with scripture. &gt;&gt; He placed himself. &gt;&gt; Who are you? Tell us. &gt;&gt; Are you the one? No. &gt;&gt; But I am a voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the voice. &gt;&gt; St. John 14:es 1-4. St. John 14 verses 1-4. &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled. &gt;&gt; You believe in God, believe also in me. &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again &gt;&gt; and receive you unto myself that where I am. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Wherever that be, Lord, I want to be there. that where I am, there ye may be also, &gt;&gt; and whether I go ye know, and the way ye know. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in the presence of God. Amen. I would like to title my sermon this morning, a prepared place for a prepared people. &gt;&gt; Preparation's important. &gt;&gt; Everything in life talks about preparation. You need to be prepared because if you do not prepare and you are unprepared, you will have many failures, many mistakes, many problematic areas because you weren't prepared. And so I'm speaking on a prepared place for a prepared people. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to take this subject this morning. The bride is making herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The messenger has come. He has spoken. He's given us thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it's not just hearing what he said, &gt;&gt; but it's being obedient to what has been spoken. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Become not a forgetful hearer." That you go straight way and well, I I forgot. Uh well, tell me again. &gt;&gt; God, help us to be obedient &gt;&gt; hearers that we hear something. And I've always said this, it's not just the words, but I want the understanding. &gt;&gt; I want to hear the voice behind the voice. &gt;&gt; I want to hear the voice behind the veil. And let me just take this now and say that this prepared place I I want to speak about that and I cherish the thought that he says I have a place prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How comforting that should be to every Christian. &gt;&gt; Okay. who because you're on a journey down here. And let me tell you, don't ever set your set your tent pigs too deep here cuz you know what? &gt;&gt; We're in the feast of tabernacles and it's a temporary &gt;&gt; temporary dwelling place. Thank God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that our kingdom is not of this world. We sink in another kingdom. &gt;&gt; One that's not ruled by &gt;&gt; these kind of laws and governments and things and all of that. But we have another kingdom that is so far greater than this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I not only want to talk about a prepared place, but how about a people prepared &gt;&gt; for that place &gt;&gt; because I want to make it personal &gt;&gt; I want to bring it down home. &gt;&gt; So there were several things that Jesus said there in St. John 14. and I measure his words. He said, "The words that I speak to you, they are spirit &gt;&gt; and they are life." &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But though there were thousands of people that heard Jesus speak, there were only few that understood what he was talking about. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, with all of your getting, with all of your listening, and with all of your reading, and all of your listening to tapes, whatever you do, get some understanding of what you're listening to. &gt;&gt; Several points. One is in my father's house. Now the word house the prophet of God said is kind of translated in a incorrect way that when we think of a house in my father's house are many mansions. So his house must be a lot of square footage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's pretty big. This big old house. He's got mansions inside the house. But it's actually it means in my father's domain &gt;&gt; in my father's kingdom. And my father's place where he lives &gt;&gt; are places I've prepared. &gt;&gt; It's custom. &gt;&gt; Eye has not seen &gt;&gt; nor ear heard what God has prepared &gt;&gt; for his people. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I'll tell you, it'll be beyond your wildest imagination. It'll be beyond sublime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be beyond perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I just I guess it just warms my heart when I think &gt;&gt; that my God thinks so much of me. &gt;&gt; I have prepared a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My thank God for that place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, and he says, I've prepared a place for you. Now, it puts us now into the equation. He is not only the architect, but he's also the general contractor. Yes. &gt;&gt; His laborers that are working for him are subcontractors. &gt;&gt; And they all better build according to his plan. Because even Paul said, "Let every man take heed how he builds on this foundation." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says another point, I will come again and receive you. Talks about his second coming. He said, well, I've come and I've come and I've paid the price for redemption. He says redemption has two parts. Coming out &gt;&gt; and going into. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may I declare unto all of you this morning, and I trust it's happening to you as it's happening to me. And that is we're entering into &gt;&gt; another stage of the ministry. Not we're talking we're not talking about just five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a ministry. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the body &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. And each one of you members in particular, and you say, "Well, I'm nobody big. I'm just a small part." But I'll tell you, did not Jesus say that even the smaller parts &gt;&gt; are of great significance? When you look at a watch and you see the hands in the face and the numbers and all that, you don't see the integral part of something moving behind the scene. &gt;&gt; You don't see the people praying for the ministry. if you don't see the ones that are there, that are uh cleaning the church, that are doing the audio, that are doing all of the stuff, that are working and praying. And &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, some of you may never preach a sermon behind a pulpit, but may God use you to be a living epistle, to be a sermon preached to your neighbors, to your friends, and to your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fourth part is where I am. Where &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; there you will be with me also. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; there's something about just being with dad. &gt;&gt; When I was a kid, if you're with dad, I never asked, "Do you got enough money? All right. &gt;&gt; Is there gas in the car? &gt;&gt; What if we have a flat? &gt;&gt; Are you going to get lost? Do you know where you're going? &gt;&gt; I just sat back. I'm a dad. &gt;&gt; I'm along for the ride. &gt;&gt; I'm just enjoying it. Why? &gt;&gt; Cuz my father took care &gt;&gt; of all of the needs. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, I want all of you to sit back and relax. Your father knows &gt;&gt; what you have need of &gt;&gt; and he will provide. &gt;&gt; When you come against a wall, he'll make a way. &gt;&gt; When he comes against the Red Sea, he will open it up. When storms come, he will calm the storm. Let me tell you, he is Jehovah, God, &gt;&gt; and he will provide all of your needs, not your wants, &gt;&gt; not maybe your desires. &gt;&gt; Come on. You may want a Mercedes and God gives you a Volkswagen. &gt;&gt; Just be happy. Guess what? &gt;&gt; Or the Lamborghini or the Ferrari. And guess what? Those guys, they spend all that money and they race off of the line like so many people do in the traffic. They speed it. You catch up to them in the next two minutes. &gt;&gt; He's wasted all that time, that gas, and your car is much cheaper. We get there. Maybe not in as much style, but we get there. &gt;&gt; Understand that you may not have the biggest and the best and the fastest, but you will get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The father's house in Greek it means in his domain in his tabernacle his place of abode his residence. &gt;&gt; It also means in my father's kingdom mansion means a place of relationship not just a location &gt;&gt; means a state of position. or a condition or another dimension. &gt;&gt; Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; May all of us here this morning at some time during the ministry of this sermon, may you be jettisoned into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. to where all of a sudden you be quickened so much by the word of God that you leave your chair not physically but spiritually. Wow, &gt;&gt; that was good. And &gt;&gt; let me tell you that good that you feel &gt;&gt; when you are quickened like that is one day going to become so good and goodter &gt;&gt; and the goodest &gt;&gt; until you was not &gt;&gt; until you are taken and caught away &gt;&gt; caught up. &gt;&gt; I tell you since 1971 I've been caught up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This world is not your final destination. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The grave is not our final resting place. This is only a shadow of something far greater. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that Jesus said, "Be ye perfect as your father in heaven is perfect." Now, I don't know about you, but that makes me nervous. Because there's been times that I've thought, "How can I be perfect? &gt;&gt; How can I say and do and act?" Because just about the time you think, "Okay, I'm going to be perfect." You get out of bed and you stub your toe or the meal's not cooked the way it you like it, whatever, and all of a sudden you lose it, right? &gt;&gt; You know what they used to do when you went hunting with brother Brennham? They had a camp cook. And the rule was that the first one to complain of the cooking became the cook. A lot of you'd be doing your own cooking. Yeah. One time the brother he he got the biscuits were quite hard. And the brother he he said, "Man, this biscuit is as hard as a hockey puck." And as as soon as he said it, he realized they can't rule and he said, "But that's just how I like it. God cannot send you somewhere that you cannot go." &gt;&gt; God will not ask of you to do something that you cannot do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would be unfair for a god to tell you to be perfect &gt;&gt; and he couldn't make a way of perfection for you. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about this physical perfection because this body, no matter how much you put of the Holy Ghost on it, is still got its imperfections. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, I'll take off this imperfection and put on God's perfection. I'll put on a theophony body that's been speaking to me, that's been calling to me. &gt;&gt; Come up hither. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's that part of you. &gt;&gt; Understand that part of you that never felt &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Been calling to you. What is it? It is that eternal part of you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "If you're an eternal being, you always were eternal." &gt;&gt; You came down to this earth. You didn't know anything about it. Had spiritual amnesia. But when you heard the word, &gt;&gt; when you heard the word, we're not talking about somebody quoting scripture. &gt;&gt; We're talking about God opening your understanding that you might catch what the word is saying. The &gt;&gt; logos &gt;&gt; is the thought of God in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; created the heaven and the earth. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said what that God was was the logos. &gt;&gt; Logos means the thought. So, brother Brennham said, "I want to go beyond the beginning." &gt;&gt; Because he says in your Bible, it says, "In the beginning, God." Now, watch this, Johnny. You know what this prophet said? Come take a journey with me. &gt;&gt; Come journey with me beyond the curtain of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me take you back into the very eternal mind of God. &gt;&gt; Where before he was God, he was dwelling alone &gt;&gt; with his thoughts. But he would not want to live the rest of his life or his eternal being, his essence without fellowship. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He created angels. They worshiped, &gt;&gt; but that's not the fellowship he was looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted somebody &gt;&gt; like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says in the beginning God created the logos. So brother Brennham takes you back. He said if you ever was a part of God you always have to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, all of a sudden, it takes away all of this stuff of what you do and uh how you react and all of this stuff and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. And it takes away all of your good works &gt;&gt; and realize that it's by faith are we saved through grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that faith that I have is a gift of God. It's not something that I attain to. God gave me faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank you, God. &gt;&gt; The reason I believe in him, the reason I believe his word is because he gave me the faith to believe it. &gt;&gt; Watch this. In non seed. &gt;&gt; There is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus speaking of his second coming he says I go away to prepare a place. So there is a people he said I send my messenger to prepare the way. So the messenger is actually God's provided way &gt;&gt; so that you can get to the place Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is a seer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a prophet now in every age is a messenger. Behold, I send my messenger to go before me &gt;&gt; to prepare a place. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And to show you the way. &gt;&gt; Listen. Thank God for this message. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the messenger. We do appreciate the messenger that God sent, but we don't worship the messenger. &gt;&gt; But we worship him who sent the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day it will be when we see our prophet and we hug his neck and everything. But listen, there's one even greater that I want to see than him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? That's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God's a way maker. &gt;&gt; Now understand that only and I I'm going to clarify something here and listen carefully. Measure these words &gt;&gt; that only the Holy Ghostfilled bride will fully understand what this prophet messenger is saying. &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin are quickened or awakened to the fact that there's a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Five wise, &gt;&gt; five foolish. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it came about the midnight hour a shout. &gt;&gt; And that shout was an exclamation. &gt;&gt; It was declaring something. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him. &gt;&gt; So this message is a message of preparation. &gt;&gt; Get ready. &gt;&gt; He's coming. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to all of you. Get ready. He's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of them, both wise and foolish, were aroused, were awakened. Don't rejoice in the fact, well, God sent a prophet. Praise God. Message. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But that just starts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We got to get into the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not mentally acknowledging God sent a prophet, &gt;&gt; but what did that prophet say? &gt;&gt; Let's get into that message. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is more important to you than you realize. &gt;&gt; So therefore, when you ask God, God, give me revelation. &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly. &gt;&gt; God, give me revelation that will blow my mind, that will quicken me. Pardon that old that old expression, but &gt;&gt; let me get so inspired &gt;&gt; that I think it not robbery &gt;&gt; to be equal &gt;&gt; with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a position. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's a placing. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said in the feast of trumpets 64 and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet, &gt;&gt; same everything. Exactly the same seal and that seventh seal is our seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? That's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to what? call the people, &gt;&gt; the bride out of the Pentecostal and worldly tradition. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To the genuine atonement, the word. &gt;&gt; Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh among us. See, science proved it by pictures. The church knows it. The world around, we firmly know it. He's never told us one thing. In thus sayaith the Lord, but what's been the truth? He did. Did he not say down there on the river as John the Baptist was sent? So will this message. &gt;&gt; Brother R said, I looked up and it was 12:00. &gt;&gt; Midnight hour is here friends &gt;&gt; upon us. See how perfect the scripture is. Now I want all of you to understand that you have been quickened by the shout of this end time. &gt;&gt; That's the message &gt;&gt; that was spoken by Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; The messenger recognizing your day and its message. So the shout caused an awakening, a quickening. You've been caught up. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And you'll be caught up together with them." &gt;&gt; That word caught up actually is the Greek word harpado means to intercept, &gt;&gt; to take it by force. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing more exciting in a game than when the the other team is they're making their way play after play towards the goal line and all of a sudden they're throwing a pass and one of the guys intercepts it. &gt;&gt; They wasn't expecting it. He grabs that pass and all of a sudden touchdown. &gt;&gt; I want you all of you to understand the enemy. I listened to spoken word as the original seed last night and again this morning and he says now Satan is deceiving all of the people in this age denominationals put them all under the same blanket. He said the world is religious. &gt;&gt; Huh? He don't Hey, listen. He don't care if you're religious. He'll let you be religious. &gt;&gt; You can have Christ in a manger. He is no longer in a manger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring Christ out of history. Bring him down into a tabernacle thou has prepared for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said it's a relationship. &gt;&gt; We are part of a woke generation. We're seeing it all around us. Woke this and woke that. That's just the imitation of something that's in the real. &gt;&gt; Because when this message &gt;&gt; Yeah. comes to your understanding and you begin to become enlightened. &gt;&gt; It actually to you is your position. &gt;&gt; It's causing you to be caught up to to actually become intercepted. &gt;&gt; He catches you by force. Let me tell you, since I came across this message, or may I say it came to me. &gt;&gt; I didn't find it. It found me. &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; I didn't go find Christ. I wasn't looking for him. &gt;&gt; He came looking for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God was looking for you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He told Paul, the Apostle Paul, one time, he says, "Go into this city and preach. &gt;&gt; For I have much seed in this city." &gt;&gt; How do you know if there's seed or not? &gt;&gt; Just preach his word. &gt;&gt; He said, "If there elected," Brother Ram said, I go and wherever I minister, he said, now to denominations, I have to be real careful because I I use a word that might offend somebody. I talk about predestinated. So he says, "So I don't use predestinated. I use for ordained, &gt;&gt; but he said if they're elected, I say just enough that they catch it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I got it." &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Just like, you know, we got a little softball team and these guys, they play together and everything. And we got an outfield. Listen, they just hit it out there. And these young guys, they run, they run like a gazelle and they love to make these spectacular catches and they slide. Got it. I said, they just somebody hit it out there and somebody's going to catch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I'm doing, I'm doing three flies up first pull. Got it. &gt;&gt; But you're just each one of you when the word goes forth. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand God's got a word for you this morning. You, every one of you, I don't care how old you are. I don't care how seasoned you are. I don't care how immature for you. God has got a word for you this morning. And you say, "I got it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll catch it &gt;&gt; if you'll be aware of it. &gt;&gt; Now, understand this. It was not the voice of William Brham that got you. &gt;&gt; Though God used his vocal cords, &gt;&gt; though God used him as the vessel, &gt;&gt; but the vessel, the trumpet, &gt;&gt; except it gives a certain sound. That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; So, thank God that God took the vessel and the trumpet in this hour and he blew it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But you have to have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Why is it you don't understand my words?" He says, "You don't understand my speech." &gt;&gt; Do you understand, &gt;&gt; brother Warren? This message is coded. &gt;&gt; It's encrypted. &gt;&gt; And I don't understand all of this stuff. And I could get guys like Warren and stuff that knows all this encryptions and secret things and and and firewalls and all this kind of stuff. But let me tell you, this message is encrypted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is. And though you listen to a tape, and though you hear that prophet speaking, there's got to come a time when all of a sudden the door opens and the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit comes down, makes you aware, and then you go, "Aha!" &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well heard Jesus speaking &gt;&gt; and he was talking to her, "Go get your husband. and I don't have one. Yeah, you've said well you've had five and a husband you got with now is not yours. &gt;&gt; Why seven is the number of completion &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She says watch this John 4 I just show you in the scripture John 4 verse 19 through 26. And a woman saith unto him, "Sir," now remember, he's been talking to her. I had a dialogue, &gt;&gt; going back and forth. She's got religious understanding, &gt;&gt; but he keeps going. She keeps going to church. She's at the well. God does things at wells. &gt;&gt; Women are found at wells. &gt;&gt; And here was the woman at the well. Answer, I perceive thou art a prophet. Wow. All of a sudden, the enlightenment Jesus saying she's getting it. &gt;&gt; Our fathers worshiped in this mountain. And we and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. So, it looks a little bit hard for her to understand. Jesus saith unto her, woman, believe me. The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem. Worship the father. You worship ye know not what. &gt;&gt; We know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews. &gt;&gt; But the hour cometh and now is. Somebody say now is. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Now is. &gt;&gt; The hour cometh and now is. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the true worshippers shall worship the father &gt;&gt; in spirit &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; in truth. Why? Because the truth will set you free. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people worshiping in spirit. &gt;&gt; They're anointed by the spirit but have no truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For the father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And a woman saith in him, I know, now watch, she's getting more religious now. I know that the Messiah cometh, &gt;&gt; which is called Christ. &gt;&gt; When he has come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her &gt;&gt; I that speak unto thee &gt;&gt; am he. &gt;&gt; I'm the one. &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, and the life. And no man comes to the father but by me. &gt;&gt; You're saying when the Messiah comes, he'll show you all things. woman. &gt;&gt; Tada. &gt;&gt; I see Jesus in him only. &gt;&gt; I don't see three gods. &gt;&gt; I see God as one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Both the wise and the foolish virgin were awakened by the shout. The time had come for final preparation because it's lamp trimming time. &gt;&gt; But the foolish failed to make a preparation before the shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oil a type of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; With all of your getting, get the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Ghost since you came to the message? That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, I was baptized. &gt;&gt; By the messenger, &gt;&gt; I see the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say a little bit more. Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Like the little mama teaching it. Yeah. Good. Good. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. One more. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this final preparation, it's lamp trimming time. &gt;&gt; It's a time to find out because now listen why it's evening time. It's about midnight. Most people are sleeping. &gt;&gt; And there was a shout about the midnight hour &gt;&gt; because there's no light. Sun's gone down. Come on. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not fault them &gt;&gt; that they their light was not shining. He said, "Now trim your lamp." &gt;&gt; But at the very time, the shout that awoke them, they realized at that time, I need to go out and meet you. &gt;&gt; And they lit their lamp. And if any of you that have ever used oil lamps, probably some of you have never done it. But you take a lamp that has the bowl, it has the wick, it has the globe, it has the adjuster that this and you light it. If there's never been oil on the wick, you light the wick and it lights for just a second and very suddenly goes out. So you understand that unless you have the oil, you're not going to burn for him. &gt;&gt; Your light cannot shine. &gt;&gt; So at the very hour when he says, "Get ready." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him. And he went and trimmed their lamps. And that's when the foolish virgin realized, "I haven't got it." &gt;&gt; Now listen, I want to say this as a pastor. I'm not saying it's over. &gt;&gt; But we're close. &gt;&gt; I'm saying if you don't have the Holy Spirit, you make sure you get it. Why? It's a promise. &gt;&gt; And God keeps his promises. And he said, "I'll give you the promise of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; It's a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a gift has got to be received. If I say, "Carver, man, I got a gift for you, buddy. I got a gift." Man, you're going to love it. I'll tell you what, I have worked so hard. I'm going to give you a gift. And no matter how much I talk about it, it ain't yours until you &gt;&gt; receive it. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, and he breathed on him, receive he &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. They didn't get it right then. &gt;&gt; He's just saying, when it comes, &gt;&gt; receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to receive the Holy Spirit for it is a &gt;&gt; it is a gift of God. It is a promise and God does not give a gift and then take it back. &gt;&gt; So if you haven't received it, I ask you why have you not? Well, I was baptized unto John, but John said my baptism &gt;&gt; is unto repentance. But the one I'm preaching about, &gt;&gt; the one who I am a messenger to prepare, I tell you there's one greater than me coming after me. And his baptism is far greater. &gt;&gt; For he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And fire. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Fire." &gt;&gt; Fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Fire. the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; fire. There's no better cleansing &gt;&gt; for anything in this world. If you go to the hospital and they use their alcohol and all that stuff, that's good. You go to the dentist and they clean your teeth, man. I pray that they use the enclave to clean those tools before they put it in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be terrible? &gt;&gt; Yuck. I can't even think. No greater &gt;&gt; cleansing &gt;&gt; than fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, boy. &gt;&gt; The lamp is only used in evening time when the sun's gone down. So now trim your lamps. And so they trim their lamps and they go out to meet him. Now the son of man, you say, "Well, they They didn't expect him at midnight. &gt;&gt; Because the son of man cometh when you least expect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, had I known, I'd have been ready. But man, it's not fair. You come when I'm sleeping. Brother Brandham said in the sermon, the rapture, and understand that the rapture is not a single event. &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord is not just the catching away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rapture is not just being translated. &gt;&gt; There's a transformation taking place right now. &gt;&gt; You're being changed from one glory to another glory. And little by little, that's how that they took the promised land was little &gt;&gt; by little. They couldn't take it all at once. Why? &gt;&gt; Didn't have the the means. &gt;&gt; And yet God said, "Go. I've given you the land, &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to fight for it." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, in the sermon, the rapture, now watch this. The first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven. There's a shout. So, can we say he we've seen his descending? &gt;&gt; Huh? You recognize the shout? Can you then Hey, he's descending. &gt;&gt; So, the rapture is already happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you understand that it's happening? Hey, &gt;&gt; he's coming. &gt;&gt; He's descending. &gt;&gt; We've heard the shout. What is it? It's a message &gt;&gt; to get the people together. That's why you're here this morning. &gt;&gt; Not because it's my ministry. &gt;&gt; Not because it's a good location, &gt;&gt; not because this is a convenient church, &gt;&gt; but because God sent a message, &gt;&gt; to get the people together. A message come forth. First lamp turning time. Rise and trim your lamps. What watch was that? The seventh. Not the sixth. The seven behold the bridegroom cometh, rise and trim your lamps. And they did. Some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamp. It's lamp trimming time. Malachi 4 time. &gt;&gt; It's Luke 17. &gt;&gt; It's all the prophecy that can be perfectly set in order for this day. And in the scripture, we're seeing it living right there. &gt;&gt; Never before in the history of mankind has been man more desirous of more oil. the most precious commodity &gt;&gt; oil. He that controls the oil controls &gt;&gt; the economy &gt;&gt; because everything that we touch and everything around us and all of our facets of life have to do with petroleum products. &gt;&gt; The clothes you wear, the car you drive, the food that you eat. Not it's a petroleum product. I caught that. No, but you use fuel to light the fire &gt;&gt; to keep it going. You see, to to heat it up &gt;&gt; or you might nuke it. I've This is just me. I've always wondered how in the world you put this thing in there, press it, A few minutes later, this thing's steaming hot. &gt;&gt; Is it good for you? I don't know. I know this. I don't want my food nuclear. I want mine warmed up. I want fire to touch that thing. Okay. Anyway, now all of you going to get rid of your every pass. Who said, "Oh, no." Yeah. Okay, Steve. All right. You get a free pass on that one. Every facet of your way of life has to do with oil. That's why it's such a important commodity &gt;&gt; because it affects the way you walk, the manner of speech and the way you live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand that this oil of the Holy Spirit will affect every facet of your life. The way you walk, the way you talk, &gt;&gt; your manner of speech, &gt;&gt; your position &gt;&gt; has to do with oil. Jerusalem is now the hot spot of the world. &gt;&gt; It is a hot potato. Oh my. Jerusalem. Why Jerusalem? Not why not Mecca? Why not New York City? &gt;&gt; Huh? Why not these other places around the world? There's only one place and a world is consumed with Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Because Jerusalem is not just a location. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a bride. &gt;&gt; It's a people. It is not only a prepared place but a prepared people &gt;&gt; because those that are in the bride are going to live in the new &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. We are marching over to Jerusalem. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; And the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; That's the reason it's such a hot spot, a hot potato. And the Bible says, "And be beware of how you handle Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; because we're seeing an anti-semitic spirit come up in the world today. And we're seeing this come up against them because they're Jews. &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing that those who support Jerusalem are being attacked. &gt;&gt; Why do you think 911 happened? &gt;&gt; Why the Twin Towers, the World Trade Center? Why? Because of Wall Street Jews. &gt;&gt; Control the economy. &gt;&gt; You want to shake somebody up, hit their pocketbook. &gt;&gt; So they attacked the United States &gt;&gt; because we were supporting Israel. &gt;&gt; Because whosoever blesses Israel shall be blessed. We're seeing it more and more in your newspapers &gt;&gt; in almost every day enough anti-semitism coming up the college campuses. Why college campuses? Because they're of the tree of knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; And these young kids without a baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; their influence, &gt;&gt; through their carnal reason, &gt;&gt; through the knowledge of man. God is not known by knowledge. &gt;&gt; God is known by revelation. &gt;&gt; So you go to these places of higher education of the tree of knowledge. Let me tell you, you young people, you go to get a career, if you don't are not balanced with the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; that place of higher education will eat you up and spit you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've seen some of the finest young people I know go off and go to school, go to college, next thing you know, &gt;&gt; they leave the message, leave Christ, and they're off &gt;&gt; because the God of this evil age hath blinded &gt;&gt; their minds, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine on them &gt;&gt; places of higher education. So now all these colleges and people that are supposed to be so smart &gt;&gt; professors &gt;&gt; and teachers of our children &gt;&gt; when most of them don't even know if they're a man or a woman. &gt;&gt; The messenger is sent to prepare the way. The word way in Hebrew means a course of life or a manner of action or a manner of life. I go to prepare the way, a manner of life. So the messenger is not to just preach about a message, but he's to prepare a way, a manner of life, an action to get you into action. And let me say this that John the Baptist said, "I am the voice crying in the wilderness to prepare the way." And everyone that his ministry touched as they received the messenger, it affected their manner &gt;&gt; of life, what they live, their manner of speech. This message if it has not changed your life &gt;&gt; or it's not in the process of changing you. &gt;&gt; Either you're not seed &gt;&gt; or you haven't grown up enough to quit your childish ways. Because when I was a child, &gt;&gt; I thought, I spoke, &gt;&gt; I understood as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so to prepare a way means to change the manner of life. If this message or this messenger has not changed your life, I doubt your seed. &gt;&gt; Chew on that for a while. &gt;&gt; Because though you've been raised in a message, church doesn't make you seed. &gt;&gt; Though you've been raised with &gt;&gt; seed parents, &gt;&gt; Isaac and Rebecca brought forth also in Esau. &gt;&gt; So as much as we say all of our children are seed, &gt;&gt; it will be their reaction &gt;&gt; to that messenger's message &gt;&gt; that proves whether or not they are seed. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's It's true. I I Look, I'm not here to baby you. I'm not here to &gt;&gt; I'm not here to talk you into it, &gt;&gt; to persuade you. No. Listen, if you're if you're Lex Seed, you'll see it. &gt;&gt; Huh? I don't have to sit here and scream and yell it at you. If you're in Lexi and you're going to jump, you're going to shout because there's a lot of times I'm not jumping and I'm not shouting, &gt;&gt; but I'm still seed. &gt;&gt; I like to jump and shout. &gt;&gt; But man, give me something to jump and shout about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now in school in botany or biology, any of you that were in school, you understand there is a process whereby things that have the ability to take light and process it into life. That process is called &gt;&gt; photosynthesis. How do you spell it? &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. How you spell photoynthesis? In other words, these plants catch the sunlight. They come &gt;&gt; all of a sudden the light &gt;&gt; grow. &gt;&gt; I'm following the sun. &gt;&gt; You sisters put a plant in the window. &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun. You see the plant &gt;&gt; this way. What? Do you turn the pot? No. The plant. The plant tracks the sun. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm tracking the sun. &gt;&gt; Because God's constant. He keeps moving. And wherever he moves, I'm attracted to it. What is this attraction? I tell you, it's called photosynthesis. I'm taking the light. Hallelujah. And I'm catching it. And I'm turning it into light. And I'm growing and I'm pushing out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's changing me from glory to glory &gt;&gt; until one day I'll be totally changed in a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only those ordained to eternal life will catch it. They're the only ones that have the ability. &gt;&gt; A rock feels the same sunlight. &gt;&gt; No life change. A brick feels the same sunlight. &gt;&gt; No change. &gt;&gt; A piece of steel &gt;&gt; gets warm by the same sunlight. Like people go to church. Oh, I feel this warm fuzzy feel. &gt;&gt; But there's no change. That's why people can go &gt;&gt; be under the anointing of God. &gt;&gt; They feel the effect. &gt;&gt; But look at the congregation. There's no change. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The thing about this message, look at the lives of the people &gt;&gt; who were off in denomination under the darkness of religion and they see the light in the end time and their eyes come open and their lives are changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell them what to do. &gt;&gt; They catch it. Just preach the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Acts 13 verse 46. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken to you, but seeing you put it away, you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life. Lo, we turn to the Gentiles." So hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. &gt;&gt; And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Why are you believing? What do you believe? Because you were ordained to eternal life. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. &gt;&gt; I just know it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I read a little thing that had these children, the teachers asking questions for the students, and some of the kids come up with some profound answers. And one of the questions was, "How did you circle the answer and make the right decision?" And the little kid just said, "I just know." &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how how did you make this decision? &gt;&gt; I just know. &gt;&gt; Nobody talked me into it. I just know &gt;&gt; I love it says and I know this that when he comes we &gt;&gt; shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we shall know even as I am known. Amen. &gt;&gt; You talk about &gt;&gt; an upgrade &gt;&gt; in your understanding. &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond &gt;&gt; anything. And just about the time that I think I'm fully re revelated and I'm pretty well catching it, God opens another door. &gt;&gt; And I realize that the more I know, the less I know. &gt;&gt; How do I know that? I just know. And he said, "God is so great, it will take an eternity &gt;&gt; to reveal himself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just starts here. &gt;&gt; And he that begun a good work in you will finish it. &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; He has only sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Grandparents spoil their children. their grandchildren. Grandchildren, not their their children. They worked on them, man. Huh? Yeah. My grandkids get away with stuff that my kids said, "You never would have let me get." Well, that's cuz I've learned a little bit now. I'm a better father now as a grandfather than I was when I was a father. You're going to do Yeah. And usually when we get all excited and we get angry and we want to correct our kids, a lot of times we don't have the right attitude, do we? &gt;&gt; Huh? The Bible says, "Be be careful, &gt;&gt; oh father, how that thou correct thy son &gt;&gt; because the way you correct him, God will correct you." How much of the time? Like that one preacher, I don't say this to be a joke or sacrilegious. That pastor one time got so vexed with his people. You hardheaded people. I tell you what, I'm sick and tired of the hypocrisy. I'm tired of the people. And he just got he says, "God, I want you to smite every one of them." &gt;&gt; And just soon as he said it, his heart began to fail. He grabbed his chest. They said, "Oh God, save every one of them." &gt;&gt; How dare we look our nose &gt;&gt; down our nose at others? I'm glad I'm not like that guy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I'm glad somebody didn't judge the book by its cover when they saw me. &gt;&gt; Long-haired hippie. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In fact, Brother Brennham. &gt;&gt; Huh? These Rickies, these Rickettas, &gt;&gt; I tell you this Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. Till God said, "Hey, stop it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some of those Rickys are mine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One of them. &gt;&gt; Ricky, are you here? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I was one of them. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wasn't my name. It was my nature. &gt;&gt; But not my seed. Because we were even as others &gt;&gt; who were by nature &gt;&gt; children of disobedience. And I thank God he didn't say we were by seed children. No. Because if you're children of seed, &gt;&gt; you will be children &gt;&gt; of obedience. &gt;&gt; Not that you don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; If God doesn't correct you, &gt;&gt; he doesn't love you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because as many as I love, &gt;&gt; I rebuke and I &gt;&gt; give them all of the that they want. &gt;&gt; I make them spoiled rotten brats. &gt;&gt; Every prayer they pray for and everything, oh God, give me this. Oh God, give me that. And if God did that and gave you everything you ask for, well, I ask for it in Jesus name. But Jesus also said, "But when you ask, ask in faith, believing, &gt;&gt; Lord, why don't you give me a Mercedes? &gt;&gt; You don't need a Mercedes. &gt;&gt; You're carnal. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with it. If you can drive a Mercedes, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My son's got one. &gt;&gt; I like to drive it. I like when he drives me around in it. What I'm saying, hey, it's it's not remember men in the scripture that were great men were also vastly wealthy. &gt;&gt; It wasn't their wealth that made them great. &gt;&gt; Do you know some of you will never have things of great value in this because you know what? You can't handle it. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's why you're going to stay a popper the rest of your life &gt;&gt; because God can't give you &gt;&gt; something of great value because you know what? You will put too much emphasis on it. &gt;&gt; And you use an excuse. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I I I have to build a bigger barn. &gt;&gt; I have married a wife. A lot of people get married and you know what? They use their wife as an excuse why they're not in church. Okay. &gt;&gt; Um, I've got a cow. I've got I bought a piece of land. I've got to go prove it. &gt;&gt; All this. What's your excuse? &gt;&gt; God help us &gt;&gt; to be one of those faithful. Huh? &gt;&gt; Not using every excuse &gt;&gt; why not to go to church. I want to find every excuse why to go. Okay, I'm gonna pass a few things up here. &gt;&gt; Wait a second. Just as it was in the first Exodus. Musicians, if you come, I'm going to I'm closing. I'm not done yet, but I'm closing. Okay. Just letting you guys relax here for a second. Just as it was in the first Exodus, there was a messenger. His name was Moses. Moses was God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Without the prophet, you had no message. You had no Exodus. And so as it was in the first Exodus where there was a messenger which was God's provided ways to take a people to a prepared place. So he was God's provided way to take a prepared people to a prepared place. Eve was a prepared vessel for Adam. that Adam might reproduce himself. Okay, you understand? Rebecca prepared herself to meet Isaac. Ruth prepared herself to meet Boaz. &gt;&gt; Esther prepared herself. She put on the garments that the messenger told her, "Hey, I know what the king likes. Here's the here's the clothes." Esther, Esther, she comes into her position. She was called, &gt;&gt; listen, &gt;&gt; she was called to go into this position. So are you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were called to this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election sure. &gt;&gt; Esther. Well, if he didn't send you a summon to bring you there, you might die. If I perish, &gt;&gt; I perish. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I shall go before the King. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no question in my mind, but when she walked in, &gt;&gt; there was a hush, maybe a half hour of silence, &gt;&gt; she's ushering in. Who is this? It's Queen Esther. What is it, my queen? What is it that you desire up to half of my kingdom? Esther was called to go before the king. &gt;&gt; Why? That was her position. &gt;&gt; You have been called to a city, New Jerusalem. That's the place. &gt;&gt; He's called you his wife. That's your position. &gt;&gt; But you're going to sit with him on his throne and you will be queen. You understand? That's her pleasing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. My brother, my sister, the more that I lay myself before the Lord and I meditate and I read and I listen, the more it's quickened to me. And &gt;&gt; something's happening. &gt;&gt; If I could say this, my ministry is changing. What is it? Because it's more him. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a great mystery. It's no longer I that live, but Christ that liveth in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it's all about. It's about him. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, okay. So, a prepared place for a prepared people. Now, I want to launch off into my next sermon and just tell you because there's a table prepared in the face of mine enemies. &gt;&gt; Even on your cell phone, of all the millions of apps, there's one called &gt;&gt; the table. &gt;&gt; And there God has prepared a feast &gt;&gt; in the presence of mine enemy &gt;&gt; and Lord the Bible says that thou shalt not eat of the table of devils and the table of God. &gt;&gt; But he has bid us to come to his feast. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then, who is a wise and faithful servant who shall give the people spiritual meat in due season? It's not just tickling your ears and preaching some kind of sermon. Oh, I got some good quotes. I'm going to save them. I'll share them with you the next time that we get together. Actually, you know, you never actually finish your sermon. &gt;&gt; No, it just keeps unfolding. &gt;&gt; Keeps just getting better and better. And you see this and then you just put him in remembrance. That's all we do. We just I just let you go home, let you relax a little bit, and then uh have you come back, then we just continue on and everything because it it's a continuing story, is it not? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love him this morning more than I've ever loved him. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; Oh, do I have false failures? Yes, I do. It happens every day. &gt;&gt; But I thank God I have a mediator. &gt;&gt; I think I have I I thank God that I have a sacrifice that I can go to. &gt;&gt; Because a body thou has prepared for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you are. He's called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to live inside of you. &gt;&gt; I want to totally consume you." When Lucas Rubi years ago and I pro I talked about the rapture as a revelation, you remember the song he sang? &gt;&gt; I'm rapture positive. I said because you know AIDS which is autoimmune deficiency and when you get AIDS and you have symptoms and it's carried it's a disease of the blood and when you get infected there's a time when you're just you know I I'm infected I I've got AIDS but when I get fullblown own AIDS, then the body is consumed. &gt;&gt; Brother Lucas says, "Brother Ron, I'm rapture positive. &gt;&gt; I got the symptoms.
