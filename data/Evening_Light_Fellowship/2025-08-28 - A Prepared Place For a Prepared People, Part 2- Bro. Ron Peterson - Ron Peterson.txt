And when he drew near, my heart filled with fear. I heard someone dear calling me to his side. And I ran under his wings. &gt;&gt; And there he covered me. And now I can see. &gt;&gt; The enemy still looks for me. But what they cannot see is I'm under my Lord's wings. &gt;&gt; I'm under his wings. &gt;&gt; Thunder rolled, dark clouds hung low. I was out in a storm. I was shivering in the coldness there. No safe retreat from home. Then there blew strong winds. Would this be my end? Then I heard my friend. He was calling me to his side. And then I ran under his wings. Oh, and there he covered me &gt;&gt; and I can see for the enemy &gt;&gt; still looks for me. &gt;&gt; But what he cannot see is that I'm under my Lord's wings. Oh, I'm under his wings. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nighttime came, the shadows fell. I could not find my way. Oh, the tears of night took hold and I yearned for break of day. And then he saw my plight. And in the night he shined his light and called me to his side. And I ran under his wings. And there he covered me. And now I can't sing. Oh, the storm still rages. When the rock of ages, I'm resting. Oh, under my Lord's wings. Oh yes, I'm under his wings. &gt;&gt; You see the storm still rages, but I'm in the rock of ages. I'm resting.

God bless you all this evening. Let's just remain standing. Let's go directly to the word. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Uh Justin and Katie, thank you for that song. Amen. Under his wings. Huh? That's the best &gt;&gt; atomic uh bomb shelter you could ever be under. Under. And it's made of feathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Think about that. It's not concrete and steel. It's feathers. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm covered by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. I am just happy to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; And brother Scott, God bless you, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You could have been upside down, flipped, thrown out of the car, &gt;&gt; paraplegic, &gt;&gt; but you're here tonight. &gt;&gt; Praising God. &gt;&gt; Cars can get repaired, all that stuff. Huh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank God for traveling mercies. &gt;&gt; Thank God. We should never take it for granted that we just get in the car and go down and stuff, you know, just one little &gt;&gt; slip of something. Huh? &gt;&gt; Being inattentive. Get on your phone, whatever. God, watch over each and every one of us. Huh? Next month, uh, Brother Chris Take is going to be coming and visiting us. He'll be speaking on a Wednesday night. Brother Eugene Braun will be taking our banquet service and then a Sunday morning. So, we'll look forward to that. And, uh, Brother Mario texted me today. I said, "Are you going to be staying until October when we go over to Philippines for a ministers meeting and then on to Thailand?" He said, "No, I'll be back next week." And I said, 'Well, we'll look forward to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so, also too, I just want to um Brother Kelly McMillan who had the throat surgery and and all of that, and it was major, major, major. And um you know, they did the uh swallow test here couple months a or a month and a half ago or so, and he couldn't swallow. And so they did another test on Tuesday it was. And he said, "Brother Ron, uh, I could swallow a teaspoon." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Wow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, listen. Little &gt;&gt; by little. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything in the right direction. He said, "Well, it's been three or three plus months or so of unable to even swallow." So what we take for granted others now doctor's doctor &gt;&gt; they do their thing they cut they sew they splice they put things back together but God's the healer right &gt;&gt; so I'm asking God and you all just remember brother Kelly McMillan in your prayers and say God be merciful to him allow the the muscles and everything to come back and to you know the everything that it'll work and function right and and may the Lord bless him and he be completely come back to a place of restoration. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just remain standing in Malachi chapter 3 and verse one. Malachi 3. Then we're going to go to Isaiah 40. Then we'll go to John 14. But what I'll do is I'll have you to just stand uh for this first reading and then we'll have you to sit down after that after we pray. Malachi chapter 3 and verse one. Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom he hath whom ye delight in. Behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. Amen. Heavenly Father, we have read your word. We ask for a blessing upon it. Open our eyes of understanding. Father, give us that spiritual illumination that only comes from you, Father. And we are totally dependent upon you. We are not looking to uh carnal interpretations, man's understanding, though that be good. We can study scripture. We can study the meaning of words. We can uh recite the Bible by memory. But unless you make it real to us by way of revelation, it only becomes knowledge. But father, you said that that knowledge would be okay. But there had to come a time when the knowledge there had to be an illumination strike it to make it real and alive. May each one here tonight, Father, be a part of that living word manifesting the life of Christ in this hour. We thank you. We praise you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right, you can be seated. But let's go to another portion of scripture. Isaiah 40. Amen. I've got these these half glasses. Half glasses. If somebody calls me Chuck Schumer, I'm going to throw these things away. I will hit them with a hammer. So, nobody say that. &gt;&gt; Oh, David. I knew you'd probably say something like that. The guy on the front row, the largest guy in the tallest guy anyway. But God bless you. Now, I won't hit it with a hammer, but you know. All right. Isaiah chapter 40 verses 3-5. Now the voice of him that crith in the wilderness. Prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every valley shall be exalted, every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all the flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Amen. Notice he's one who is crying in the wilderness. Now, the Bible says that he's going to he's going to fill up valleys. He's going to make mountains low. He's going to prepare a way, a highway. I want to ask you, when did you see that done in the ministry of John? &gt;&gt; Sometimes what these are is they are symbols of something that God is doing. He's not making crooked paths straight. We don't know of anywhere. He's not a highway uh construction man. He's going out here and he's making highways. We don't see them doing that. And yet God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass because God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; So one thing that we don't want to do is we want to say, well, uh I don't think John fulfilled that because nowhere in history do we see of one road that he made, one valley filled up, and one mountain made low. And yet God fulfilled it in the ministry of John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's in simple form. All right. John chapter 14 if you would. One more scripture. John chapter 14 verses 1-4. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God. Believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; Wow, what comforting words. &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. &gt;&gt; I say yay and amen and amen and so be it, Lord. And come quickly. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And whether I go, you know, in the way you know. God, bless your word. Tonight, we're going to continue on with this thought. I didn't get to finish it actually this past Sunday. And so, I thought, well, hey, you know what I'll do is I'll take I got some good quotes. I got some really nice things. When you begin to look at this message and you don't look at it from the standpoint of carnal understanding, but you look at it through spiritual revelation and realize that all of you are associated with a messenger in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you understand because angels are messengers, &gt;&gt; messengers are angels. The you have heavenly angels, you have earthly angels. I'm an angel right now behind the pulpit. I'm in a messenger. I'm bringing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bringing you a message. And sometimes God will answer your prayer, give you what you have need of because you prayed, sent the prayer up to heaven. There was a connection made. God sent a word down even while the minister is ministering and you got your answer. And yet &gt;&gt; the minister himself may be oblivious to how it works. &gt;&gt; That's right. And yet God ministers to all no matter the age. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you glad &gt;&gt; that this isn't uh you know the uh where you're divided up into uh advanced learning and the mediocre and the slow people over here. Uh you guys, you know, why don't you hang out in the forier because you're not getting it. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? Thank God that he puts us all together. But he does expect you to do your homework. Now, &gt;&gt; I've been known throughout the world that that I tell everybody, you do your homework. &gt;&gt; Don't you leave it up to the minister to just sit here and study the message or the Bible for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is up to you to look into it. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to get into it. It's up to you to to look at it so that when the minister is ministering and you've heard the prophet say it. You've seen the Bible say it, you'll say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Why? I know that to be true because let every man's word be a lie, but mine be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I'm titling it again, a prepared place for a prepared people. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is part two. And again the subject is the bride has made or is making herself ready. &gt;&gt; Now if you fail this test, you cannot blame it on anyone but yourself. &gt;&gt; If you miss it, &gt;&gt; you blew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were foolish. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to put all of you into bride material. &gt;&gt; I can't make you bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. But what I do remember now there are five wise and five foolish and all of them made bride material. &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? &gt;&gt; So we don't want to glory the fact that hey we heard the shout we heard a message we've received the messenger. Praise God we're in the message. I want to know is the message in you? Yes. &gt;&gt; Has this messenger had an effect on you that your life has changed? If your life is not changing, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's changing you from the glory of this terrestrial to the glory of something celestial. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are we are gaining understanding as we serve the Lord in this last hour. Now um I would like to say that this prepared place now understand that for both the bride or let's put all bride material there is a place even foolish virgin have a place &gt;&gt; are they lost &gt;&gt; do they not have eternal life &gt;&gt; no they have eternal life &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; okay but if they are foolish and they miss the rapture because that's God's final purging. &gt;&gt; You talk about God's final separation. &gt;&gt; Two in a bed, one taken, two in a field, one taken. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's God doing it. God's doing the separation. So, the bride receives her judgment. Now, she hears the word. She brings it to herself. It's self-evaluation. You see it, you hear it, you say, "I need to do better." and you make things right. &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin, my Lord de delays his coming. I dillydally. I put uh not so much emphasis on the word and what we need to do and therefore my career and church is not so important and I don't really read my Bible like I should and everything, but I love God and and you know, so I'm in the message. I want to make sure I I I want to provoke all of you &gt;&gt; unto good works. Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. I want to provoke you. And that means poking you once in a while, making you a little uncomfortable, &gt;&gt; okay? That you know, listen, we're not all going. &gt;&gt; There is a rapture that's coming and it's coming soon. &gt;&gt; He sends a messenger before he comes to prepare the way. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about. It's not about long skirts. It's not about long hair and no makeup and and and boys don't swim with the girls. You don't kiss before marriage and on and on. We've made it rules and regulations, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because that's carnal without understanding. And if I could get you to that place where you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you wake up in the morning and what's on your mind are things of the Lord. Now listen, let's let's face it. We all have carnal things that we've got to do. You've got to go to work. You've got to, you know, drive your car. You got to face family. You got to pay the bills. All of those things. But Jesus said that we've got to place our priorities on something that's even higher. &gt;&gt; He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." And all these things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, all these things are not to have that priority over even going to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, understand that there is a prepared place. It's not just a location. It's not just a location, but a condition. &gt;&gt; I've prepared a place that you can get to the place. Have you ever uh been fed up? You've ever had somebody press your button and hey, you put me in this place. It's you. Well, hey, what it is, you're just telling everybody, well, hey, you know, I'm not there. I'm not ready for it. I'm not in that place. Well, pray, read your Bible, sensitize yourself to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you are desensitized to the things of God, there can be all kinds of supernatural things happening around you. You could be riding a mule and a mule try to talk to you and you'll talk back to the mule. &gt;&gt; You'll miss it. &gt;&gt; That's right. The meal will tell you, "Ha, haven't I been your faithful mule? Haven't I been the car to take you to work all the time and everything and you're &gt;&gt; You see, saints of God, we can desensitize ourselves to the supernatural. God may send a messenger. God may send somebody your way. God may have a sermon preached just for you, and you're so carnal, you miss it. &gt;&gt; You sit there with your folded arms. You sit there uh uh desensitized to the things of God because you know what? You weren't praying and reaping. &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because whatsoever you sow to, you're going to reap from. That's why you cannot pray enough and read your Bible enough and get alone with God. Now remember one of the secrets of the third pole is I'll meet you in there. &gt;&gt; Well, where is there? &gt;&gt; The prophet asked the angel, why there? Why that little room? Is it not written in the scripture that if you will seek him in private, he'll &gt;&gt; he'll bless you openly? &gt;&gt; Get in your prayer closet. the last couple days, you know, uh listen, I've had a hard time sleeping and yes, you know, back problems and different things, but I've sat up. I got up and I sat and I didn't I didn't get on my cell phone. I didn't get on an iPad. I didn't do anything. I just sat there in the dark meditating and praying to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what a blessing it is to just think on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a prepared place, not just a location, because now a prepared place for a prepared people. If you're prepared, where is that place that we're going to? We're going to the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And that's for bride only. It's going to be a sign right over the door, bride only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin will not have their home in the new Jerusalem. They'll be saved, but they'll be outside the city. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's only for the Holy Ghost fil those that got oil. Okay. So, it's also about a relationship because the relationship is changed from servants unto friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; From woman unto wife, from church unto bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And a place means a position. &gt;&gt; So once you find your position and you have authority, guess what? Your name is as good on the check as his. &gt;&gt; In fact, you're sitting on the same throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're co-equal with him. And I know that's that that's a little bit odd. And sometimes I think, you know, whoa, I got to be careful with that because I don't want to try to take his place and push him off the throne. No, &gt;&gt; we are subject to him in all things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, adoption is positioning and pleasing. &gt;&gt; Now, understand, there are many that are going to be saved, but few sealed. &gt;&gt; You understand the difference? &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord. Then if you give your heart to Jesus Christ and you've been baptized and everything, guess what? If you believe unto him, receive his words, you have eternal life, shall not come into condemnation, right? And so we understand that they'll they're going to be saved. They praise the Lord. Salvation. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I receive the blood. That doesn't mean you're sealed. &gt;&gt; Because have you received the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; since you believe? &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't know there was a Holy Ghost. Well, I'm telling you, without the oil, you're not going in rapture. Without the oil, you'll not be in the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; So, how important is it? &gt;&gt; It is of extreme importance. &gt;&gt; Now, teaching is good. Teaching is real good. You can have teachers come in and oo you and awe you with graphs and and quotes and different things and oh, I never saw it that way. But I'll tell you what we need. We need preaching with the inspiration to get you, let's say, provoked into doing better than what you did today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Here, I don't want to be that preacher that says, "Can you say amen?" Yeah, I can, but I get caught in my own. All right. Now uh in Malachi 4 which we all claim to be a part of of this prophetic word in this end time. Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. What will be great and what will be dreadful? To miss it is dreadful &gt;&gt; because to miss the great day of the Lord means you're going to have a dreadful day. You're going to miss it. You're going into tribulation, weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth, right? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, comma, &gt;&gt; very important. And the heart of the children to the fathers. There's two parts of the prophecy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Heart of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers. So there's two parts of this. And John fulfilled the first part of the prophecy that says the heart of the fathers to the children. It's identified in scripture. I'm going to show you. You all are message believers. You're all Bible believers. And we have to go back to the Bible to substantiate these teachings because a prophet, a real prophet of God, doesn't come and add to the word. &gt;&gt; He reveals what's already there. Wow. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He he tells you because he'll say, "Well, the Bible says in Matthew 28:19 to go into all the world and preach the gospel and them that believe, let him be baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." And yet, no one in the Bible was ever baptized, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, either the disciples missed exactly what Jesus told him to do. Or there's a revelation behind what is the name of the father, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The son and holy ghost. Because Jesus said, "I came in my father's name. You didn't receive me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, Acts chapter 2, when Peter was standing there as a great spokesman, men and brethren, what do we do to be saved? &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Because this Jesus whom you have crucified, God has made him both Lord and Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the name of the father? Lord, what is the son? Jesus, Christ, holy ghost. What is the name of the father, son, holy ghost? It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to come out. And people say, "Well, it really doesn't matter." It does matter &gt;&gt; because in the scripture, how were you baptized? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he caught and he told them to get rebaptized. That's why if you say, "Well, I got baptized way back when I was a a kid and I really didn't know and I was a Baptist. I was this or that and I really uh I think it was father, son, holy ghost. You should get rebaptized." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, that we'll just go on. Now, watch what brother Brennham says. So, I want to substantiate some things here in the message questions and answers 1964. In Malachi 4, this Elijah is to take the hearts of the fathers to the children and then the hearts of the children to the fathers. Is this the same person? Yes, the same person. All right. Well, wait a minute. No, pardon me. I'm sorry. See the Holy Spirit, catch that for me then? &gt;&gt; No, it's not the same person. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I I love how brother Brennham is so honest. &gt;&gt; He'll immediately say, "Oh, no. Hey, I'm sorry. Hey, thank God for the Holy Spirit that can quicken us. There's been multitudes of times the prophet said he's answering a question and he answers it wrong." &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, he feels grieved. &gt;&gt; Oh man, is something wrong? Is there somebody sick? Did Did I say something? Um uh read that question again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh really oh lookucky there. He said I kind of felt like taking candy from a baby or something. I just it wasn't right. &gt;&gt; And so I want you to understand the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit is absolutely imperative because there are times when you may be thinking what you are saying is correct and Holy Spirit quicken you &gt;&gt; and God humble all of us. Okay? That we would have that that meek nature to say, "No, I said that wrong. I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what, um, we as ministers stand up here all the time and we're saying things and sometimes you'll say, "Moses built an ark and and uh, you know, he went through the flood and you all know, yeah." And you're going, "That guy's adding to the word, you know, or whatever. He's got no, it's just a slip of the tongue &gt;&gt; and we all do that." Amen. &gt;&gt; You've done it with your families. You've done it with your wife. You've done it with your kids. I just said I told you. And everybody around the table said, "No, Dad. You didn't say it that way." &gt;&gt; Yes, I did. No, you And so you got three or four against one. And then you finally say, "Okay, well, you know what I meant." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all want grace for ourselves, but others, you know, we would want to pin them to it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, brother Brennham, what was in Malachi 3? Sir, I send my messenger before my face, which was Elijah in Malachi 4 turns back around and says, "Behold, I send you Elijah." Malachi 3, he was to take a messenger sent before the face of the Lord Jesus, which was John. How many understands that? Malachi 4 when this Elijah comes immediately after that his message and things and after is the coming of the Lord and the renewing of the earth. Wow. Praise the Lord. So this messenger that we have in this time in Malachi 4 in turning the hearts of the father or the children to back to the Pentecostal fathers. Understand God's got to return us back to the pure word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not man's interpretations, not denominational ideas. God circumcised this message &gt;&gt; by giving angels messengers to send to brother Brennham. And he said, "There I I I I'm alone. I I I went and studied back. You all know I preached the seals before and I was aund miles from the church." Right. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Each seal came and brought and broke to me the seal as example, the first seal, the white horse rider." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now you all know I've taught that down through." And if you go back and listen to the sermons, the mighty conqueror prior to the opening of the seals in each one, he says that white horse rider, who is it? It's Jesus Christ riding down through the ages. And then when the opening of the first seal comes, oh my, I was I was so wrong. It's not Jesus Christ. It's the Antichrist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now understand, God's spirit corrects prophets when they make errors. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That doesn't offend you, does it? &gt;&gt; Well, oh, God forbid, Brother Ron, that you would ever say a prophet made an error because they always have thus sayith the Lord. And everything they say is thus sayith the Lord. And and how can you say that? Well, I'll tell you because if the prophet is corrected by the spirit of God, then we say yay and amen and we receive the correction as he received correction. &gt;&gt; Because if you teach your children, well, they're both correct. They're both right. Then you'll your kids will have such a a spirit of confusion and say, "Uh, I guess there ain't much to this message because uh how can it be the antichrist and Christ himself?" You see what I'm saying? It doesn't compute. &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of God comes and corrects the prophet, I thank God &gt;&gt; that we follow along with the unfolding of the word &gt;&gt; as it unfolds to the prophet. and then he admits, "Wow, I taught this wrong before." &gt;&gt; But when God in season corrects him and he corrects it, we receive it. &gt;&gt; That's why I will say that it's very important that if you listen to the tapes in chronological order and you went from 47 to 65, you would very clearly see that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you go from 65 to 57 over here to 61 and then over to 64 and everything and and and oh man, you will get quotes that will look as though they're contradictory &gt;&gt; and they will be &gt;&gt; because he taught it differently, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Prior to the opening of the seals, try man is a triune being body, soul, spirit. But with the opening of the No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul, soul is the inside. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And so when Okay, I'm just doing a little bit of teaching there so that all of you when the prophet of God receives correction from the Holy Spirit, we don't it it doesn't stumble us. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought every word is dust. No, no, it's not. Even the apostle Paul said, "These things I say unto you, not as from the Lord, just me telling you." &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham tells us those things too. So anyway, let's go to Luke chapter 1. I want to show you from the scriptures. Luke 1 11-1 17. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord. And we're talking about Zachcharias. And Zachcharias, remember, there's been an angel messenger come to Elizabeth. you're going to have a child and comes to him and appears to him and remember now he becomes dumb the angel because he doesn't really believe what's going to happen and so now God takes his speech from him and so now we come into this portion of scripture uh and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zachariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him and the angel said to him. Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John, and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb, before the Holy Spirit even fell on the day of Pentecost, John came forth out of his mother's womb with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Don't put God in a box. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God, and he shall go before him, who? The Lord. He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. &gt;&gt; He stops right there. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the other part and the children to the fathers. &gt;&gt; The scripture is exact. &gt;&gt; And the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and to make a people prepared for the Lord. Praise God. That's why why God sends messengers. That's why &gt;&gt; that's why we are so different than denomination. &gt;&gt; They have the same Bible &gt;&gt; and no messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To prepare them because you know what? They don't know the kind of life to that lives that's pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. So they can live any kind of life. &gt;&gt; And there's no correction. &gt;&gt; Because as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you are without correction, you are a bastard child. That's the scripture. &gt;&gt; So don't ever look at others and say, "Well, they do that and God is still blessing them." Well, listen. Um God only corrects his. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So, if you've ever had the corrective hand of God on your life, that's a very good sign you're his. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're doing things and you are like the blackbird or the buzzard who goes out and eats uh dead carrying and then comes to church and eats the the pure word and he says, "And you can go out here and live in the things of the world and then come into the word." And he says, "And you can eat from both." He said, "Uh, you're a hypocrite. You you what? You're you're a crow sticking in dub feathers. Look at me. I'm a message believer. You don't believe it? Here's my quotes. Look at me. Because they got their quotes. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; All right. Now watch verse 77. to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins. Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from our high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew and waxed strong in the spirit, and was in the desert deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel. I think brother Bram said he went in even as a young man, nine years of age, left his family, went out and he had a a diet of locust and honey. I've often wondered if I went and visited him and said, "What's for dinner?" Locust and honey. I wonder, "Were they still alive? Did they cook them? Did they flash fry them?" I don't know. I've I've been to Hey, I I've been to places in Zimbabwe. I've been places in Congo and they eat them a pony worm. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they eat ants. I've sprinkled them on my food. Little crackly things, you know, snap, crackle, pop, put them on your food. They were cooked ants. I didn't know what they were, but didn't taste bad. After I knew what they were, I I got my wife. I took a mop up honey worm and I bit it and I just swallowed it. Just no chewing, just good. So she took it and she chewed it. Oh man. Oshy gushy thing. So uh locust and wild honey. It was a different type of diet. I'm sure all of you would probably lose weight. So God uses the spirit of Elijah five times. God said he loved that spirit of Elijah &gt;&gt; because he was a one-man army. &gt;&gt; When there needed to be a man to come in and correct, I don't care if it's 450 false prophets. He come in there, man. It's Mark Mount Carmel. I and I alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. And he he he tells them, "Hey, maybe you're God. Go ahead and jump up and down. Get all exciting. Cut yourself. Maybe your God's on vacation. Maybe he need maybe he's uh needs hearing aids and you need to cry louder. And they made so much until the altar of God was broken down and everything." He mocked him &gt;&gt; until there there was no answer. And he said, "Now go ahead and and and baptize the altar. I want you to, you know," and he and he says, "And let the God who answers by fire, let him be God." &gt;&gt; And they all said, "Yay and amen, and we will serve that kind of God." And all of a suen, &gt;&gt; even the rocks were disintegrated. &gt;&gt; Okay, that listen, even when God does the supernatural, people they back up on it say, "Well, it could have been an illusion. And I think maybe it was a mirage. You know, God does things supernatural and a lot of times people want to explain it away. Oh, it was some kind of missile. &gt;&gt; It was some kind of figment of their imagination. Actually, brother Brenham said that God can judge this generation from the picture &gt;&gt; with the pillar of fire. It said the picture is greater proof than you seeing it yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you've ever seen something odd, unusual, I saw a light. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Well, did I really see it? &gt;&gt; Was it a light? Was it a refraction? Did somebody have a laser beam and trying to, you know, see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And he said that that woman that looked at that picture and she smirked, she blasphemed the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; All right. God uses the spirit of Elijah five times. Elijah, Elisha got a double portion. Do you know the bride's supposed to get a double portion? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I just bring this to your me. Then John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; And then the Elijah spirit sent in this day who we call the prophet of the hour which was brother Brandham. But the real prophet of the hour and understand this quote. Brother Brim said, "The real prophet of this hour is the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said he's the real prophet of every hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then the last and final coming will be Elijah, one of the two witnesses to come back to the Jews. And if you miss the fourth coming of Elijah, which is in this hour, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; you will see the next one. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. It'll be on CNN. It'll be on Fox News. It'll be on your iPad. And all of you will see Moses and Elijah calling plagues and doing all these things. And if you see that, &gt;&gt; you know right well, right then, you done missed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us &gt;&gt; to understand this forthcoming of Elijah. That's why. Listen. You want to know how Elijah preached? Put on a tape. We were listening to a tape the other night. Um, spoken word is the original seed. And boy, you talk about rough rough. He is he is going after that denominational spirit, the spirit of uh Jezebel, mystery Babylon, and he's hitting that thing so hard. Um, I tell you what, most of you would probably get really offended at me if I spoke like that, like he did on Spoken Words, the original seat. But he was a one-man army. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; Without fear or favor. He wasn't trying to make friends. &gt;&gt; He was here to prepare. &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. I'm going to say like the woman said, no man speak like him. &gt;&gt; That's right. You take Oral Roberts, you take Jimmy Swagger, you take all of these different great men of God in this hour. Billy Graham, great men &gt;&gt; with great ministries. &gt;&gt; But no one spake like this one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I can say yay and amen to that. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that was life-changing to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what caused me to come out from among them &gt;&gt; and be ye separate &gt;&gt; because God is a separator. He's not a mixer. &gt;&gt; Man likes mixers. God likes separators. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so let me ask you a question right now. And boy, I I'm going to have to hurry here. If you are looking for a prophecy to be fulfilled in this hour and you miss it, why would you miss it? If God fulfills and he's the interpreter of his own word and you miss the prophecy being fulfilled, here's how it can happen. because you listen to some man's interpretation, his opinion, and he told you, "Well, uh, I'll tell you, he didn't really mean that. He means this." &gt;&gt; And because you listen to someone else, you'll say, "Well, listen. When the Messiah comes, okay, he's going to do this. In fact, the king, he's coming as king. And when he comes out of heaven, why all of the why Caiaphas and all of the high priests and all of the people and the religious people will recognize and there'll be a rampart come out of heaven and all the eyes of the world will see and King Theophony will come down and they'll all worship him and God baby. &gt;&gt; Why it had to be shepherds? Y &gt;&gt; everybody else missed it &gt;&gt; except for blind Anna and Simeon. &gt;&gt; And Simeon was told by the Holy Spirit. I think I got the scriptures here. But he says Simeon was told by the Holy Spirit that his eyes before he dies &gt;&gt; shall see the coming of God's Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So here he is in the temple &gt;&gt; and and and Mary is bringing baby Jesus in to become circumcised and did and and and and Simeon. Wow. He's led of the spirit. May I may I see that that baby? &gt;&gt; Mine eyes have seen the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. what he had seen in the spirit, now he sees in a physical manifestation. &gt;&gt; And as he's worshiping, here comes blind Anna. &gt;&gt; Being led of the spirit and she comes over. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, sometimes blind people &gt;&gt; can see far better than people who have eyesight. You just have to be led of the Holy Spirit because the sight you have from God by manifestation of revelation is far greater &gt;&gt; than your physical sight because we walk by faith and not by sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you miss it, it's probably because you listen to somebody else's interpretation. That's why let them Hey, God fulfills his word the way he wants to. &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful because somebody taught you differently, you say, "Nope, nope. Can't. Nope. Nope. Sorry. Nope. It won't be that way." Just just say, "Hey, God, if you're going to fulfill your word, uh I don't care how you do it. &gt;&gt; Let me see it when it's done." &gt;&gt; Okay. So loud you see in church age. Now watch what kind of nature will Elijah have. So now he's going to explain what kind of this Elijah that's coming in this day. What kind of nature is he going to have? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; First he'll be a mighty prophet true to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For Elijah was true and John was true. That's right. Doing signs and wonders will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. And he will hate denominations like Elijah did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of nature will he have? I hate that denomination. Not the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The system. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The system, not the people. &gt;&gt; That's right. He will. I think we just got the thing started from for him now. About time he gets to come. And he's he's saying it. It's about time for that Elijah to show up on the scene. And here's his nature and what he's going to do. He's going to hate denomination. And all of us are doing the check marks. Uh hate denomination. Um &gt;&gt; and yet you could be carnally and say, "Oh, he said we're waiting for him to come." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And we're sitting there. There he is. That's him. Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You Pharisees said, "You bunch of viper snakes in the grass." He's preaching serpenty. Other words, for I tell you, God is able of these stones to raise children to Abraham. Elijah said, "They're all gone astray. Every one of them. Nobody left but me alone. Oh my. He will hate fancy women." Elijah did. Jezebel. Is that right? &gt;&gt; John did. Herodiius. Both them prophets. The spirit, the same spirit. They hated denominational world &gt;&gt; and the church world. Wait a second. What is it? I thought we're supposed to love everybody. I I I thought God is love and they're going to hate denomination and hate the church world. &gt;&gt; Now understand, it's the spirit &gt;&gt; of the system because this system is bringing &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said Satan's Eden. He says, "Watch this." End time comes in with a religious spirit bringing everyone to worship together &gt;&gt; and receive a sign and the mark of the beast. We are one in the spirit. We are one in the Lord. Doesn't matter what kind of way we serve God. Doesn't matter. They can do it with their short cropped hair, their immoral clothes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The rain, the same rain &gt;&gt; that falls on the just falls on the &gt;&gt; unjust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if it was me, I wouldn't fall on the unjust. &gt;&gt; I would make everybody see that only the just are blessed. But that's not God. &gt;&gt; So, the anointings, we're not just saying, "Well, I'm going to judge by the anointing." Because you know what? You can take some of these people &gt;&gt; and let me tell you, they're truly worshshiping and sometimes I think they put us to shame because you know what they do? They really they open themselves. But the thing is they don't realize a deceptive religious spirit has told them they're okay and so they can worship God &gt;&gt; and they're there and and you know what and I'm not at all making fun of that. No sir, I would not do that. &gt;&gt; The deceptive &gt;&gt; is they will believe a lie &gt;&gt; and be damned. &gt;&gt; There is a way that seemth right unto a man, but the end thereof is &gt;&gt; death. Now watch this. He will hate fancy women. Elijah did. Jezebel. They hated the denomination world, the church world. They hated also fancy and no good women. They something in their spirit cried out against the thing. Jezebel was after Elijah's head and was going to cut it off. And she also had John's head cut off. Herodiius did both of them. So that's why denomination wants to destroy the ministry of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's false prophet. &gt;&gt; Sure. You will find if you go type in William Brandham end time message or whatever, you're going to come up with more websites of everything that was wrong and he said this and on and on and he's my could be family, could be people from the Brandom Tabernacle, could all of that and and they've got their thing. Well, he was wrong. And you people that follow this quote message of the hour, you're all deceived. And if you can let them persuade you, &gt;&gt; you will be persuaded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But upon this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. But you know what? There'll be times when you're going to be tested and people are going to, you know, one brother called me up, "Brother Ron, will you give me just a few minutes? Just a few minutes. I want to show you all the places brother Brennan was wrong. And if you'll just give me and I said, "Brother, if you want to go to lunch, I'll go to lunch with you. If you want to go have dinner, I'll buy you dinner." I said, "But if you have come to try to prove to me that he was wrong in all the places he was wrong, you're too late." &gt;&gt; Too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've crossed the line. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The point of no return. You cannot separate the message from me. Why? Because I've become one with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So when you say he's wrong, you're saying I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm never wrong. &gt;&gt; I like that. I'm not always right, but I'm never wrong. No, I want to make you smile and laugh at times because otherwise I could screw this thing down and make it so tight that you know, hey, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We could make it to where nobody's going to make it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came the first time, they missed his coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. the religious they were looking for a king and God sent him a baby right &gt;&gt; sers we would see Jesus in 1957 look at Simeon in the temple that morning when he was promised by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ came right out in the temple led by the Holy Spirit right straight to that little virgin standing there with a baby in her arms wrapped in swaddling cloth and picked that little baby up in his arms and said, "Lord, let thy servant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." &gt;&gt; Look at old blind Anne, Anna in the temple, a prophetus, waited for the consolation of Israel, and she served the Lord day and night in the temple by fasting and praying. and she and and being spirit led, she comes by the Holy Spirit, blind, right, straight and picked up that baby and prophesied over him and for those who waited for the consolation of Israel. So now God can fulfill his word and some see it and others miss it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So I want to I want you to see how that the disciples, somebody say disciples, &gt;&gt; they missed the coming of John. They're following Jesus. &gt;&gt; Okay. Turn with me if you would into Matthew 17 verses 10 through13. And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?" Now notice how Jesus answers their question. I thought Elias is going to come first. I thought there was going to be a messenger. Is there going to be a forerunner? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come. That sounds future tense. &gt;&gt; Elias shall f surely first come. Sounds future. And restore all things. Yes. See, I tell you, it's still future. Well, keep reading. &gt;&gt; And I say unto you that Elias has come already. &gt;&gt; What? I imagine their jaws went. He did like our little grandson Liam. He he asked his grandma one day, "Grandma, are you ever going to get married?" She said, "What, Liam? I'm already married." And he in his little little mind, he said to her, "You are." And he, "Yeah, well, who did you marry?" Oah. Oah. I thought he was your father because she calls me dad. You see sometimes when you're a child you think as a child but is you know he had this real quizzical look. You are to who? that old man you call dad that Elias has come already and they knew him not &gt;&gt; and have done unto him whatsoever they listed. When you research that out they say all manner of evil against him and they did what they wanted to do with his ministry. &gt;&gt; Likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them. Then the disciples understood. Then praise God. Woo! Flash beeping. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; I got it. Then they understood. He spake of John the Baptist. Listen carefully. Now, I'm trying to bring this to a close and I'm not even I'm I'm going to hurry hurry. I may I may pass up some stuff. Although both will f false and true virgin and I call the false virgin. She's true virgin. She is a virgin material, but let's call wise and foolish. That's better wording because that's scriptural wording. &gt;&gt; So, both wise and foolish are wakened by &gt;&gt; the shout. at the midnight hour. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; And both foolish and wise awakened. The the voice said, "Uh, go ye out to meet him. Trim your lamps." And it was at that time that the foolish realized they don't have oil. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray there not be one in this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; That everyone will be ready and their lamps filled with oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because at that time, &gt;&gt; and the scripture says, "And those that had oil went in &gt;&gt; and the others were cast out where there's weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. &gt;&gt; If I would have only if I'd have been a little more serious about it." &gt;&gt; This is a very serious thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It'll only be the Holy Ghost filled that go in the rapture. Those that have the token. &gt;&gt; How dare you cheapen the token by saying something like, "Well, whoever loved him and whoever he loved is going to be there, and you don't live the word." That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because love &gt;&gt; is going Jesus said if you love me, you keep my commandments. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't say you love him and then live any kind of life you want to. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so it'll only be the Holy Ghost filled bride members that will go in the rapture. Only the Holy Ghost fil bride will be in the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; What about Hatty Wright's kids? Are they bride? I'm I I want to provoke you. I wanted to get you to thinking, wait a sec, &gt;&gt; Hattie. Hatty, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hadty, right? What do you want? I want the salvation of my two boys. Straight way they come through the door crying, got down, cried, gave their heart to the Lord. Where are they today? Are they going into church? Did they say they believe this message? Come on, man. Do your homework. Find out. You You Well, no. In fact, there's all kinds of different things like that. Now, does that stumble me? But but no. Hey, you know what? The prophet said they're going to be saved and gave them to Hattie. Right. She as a mother claimed the promise that they're going to be saved, but that doesn't make them bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if they're bride, &gt;&gt; they'll follow the word. Why? They got the oil. &gt;&gt; They got the Isaf. They got the understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, there's a vast difference between being saved and sealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just born again, &gt;&gt; but adopted. &gt;&gt; Many are called, &gt;&gt; but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election. Sure. &gt;&gt; It's not well, I'm called. Praise the Lord. In the message, got a message, family. My pastor believes a message. He preached about it. We're all going. That's it. I'm part of it. You're just caught up in the vortex. You're kind of swept up along with the movement. I want to ask, is the message in you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the token. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, take the next couple verses or sentences. And disobedience to any of that nullifies the whole promise. Full obedience entitles you to the token. Disobedience of any of it nullifies the whole thing. Okay. Now, Malachi 4 says, Malachi 3 said, "My messenger shall prepare the way." The way when you look it up, it means a course of life, a mode of action or a manner of life. This my messenger is going to prepare the way. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the father but by me. There is only one way." &gt;&gt; Amen. And this messenger came to prepare that way. &gt;&gt; Why? Not like denominations said. Well, he, you know, it really doesn't matter. And God is the center of the spoke wheel and all the spokes. It doesn't matter what religion, Baptist, uh, Methodists, Presbyterian, Buddha, Confucious, it doesn't matter. And in the center, the hub is God. And we all get there. And then, no, Jesus said, "I am the way. Right? &gt;&gt; I am the manner of life. &gt;&gt; There is no life outside of Jesus Christ because he that hath the son &gt;&gt; hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life. No man comes to the father but by me. &gt;&gt; So the revelation of Jesus Christ is what God is making himself known from Genesis to Revelation. The whole Bible is God making himself known &gt;&gt; because Christ, that anointing is the mystery of God &gt;&gt; revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, this is good. You guys are listening. You don't have to be shouting and jumping and I want you to listen. It's good. &gt;&gt; Okay. And sometimes as I preach, I I let you kind of finish the sentence before I do because I want to see, are you reading your Bible? Are you sitting there looking at me like a a cow at a new gate? Got no idea what he talking about. Well, you ain't reading. &gt;&gt; You don't know the open book. I need you listen those that have known my ministry since I started ministrying many years ago. I have always said this. Do your homework. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want all of you do your homework. That means pray, read, listen to these tapes. Don't let me be the the high priest and the one who tells you and you listen to the way that I tell you because you know I I'm the one and I'm God's ordained. Hey, you know what? I might be a false prophet. I don't believe I am. But you know what? There's a lot of out there claiming &gt;&gt; that they're the right. And by the word, you give them the word test, &gt;&gt; right? If you don't know the word, how do you test them? &gt;&gt; By the signs and wonders? No. Wrong answer. &gt;&gt; Failed. &gt;&gt; By the anointing, wrong. They're both anointed. Then how do you tell the the right from the wrong? Take it back to the word. &gt;&gt; Because the word of God, listen to this. The word of God is our thumb. &gt;&gt; It is our absolute. Because if this prophet came and started preaching something that wasn't in the word, brother Brennham said, "You can call me a false prophet." &gt;&gt; Why, brother Brennham, what you're preaching, I think, is the 22nd book of whatever I think Revelations or Acts or whatever it was. And he says, "Well, brother, as good as that sounds, we realize we're a continuation of the Holy Spirit." But he said, "If I were to add more to the word, I would be a false prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. The apostle Paul said, "Let every man take heed how he builds on this foundation. &gt;&gt; I and I alone am the wise master builder. Let everyone admit because if they don't, let him be a nanma marinatha. Let him be accursed at his coming." Why? Because I'm laying a foundation. And if I came and though an angel came down from heaven or I came and tried to change what I've already said is thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; he said false prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were listening to tape the other day. This is this just came to my mind. And brother Brennan, there was a a doctor who said, "This man, he's got a very bad disease and he'll be dead within two or three days." Brother Bram said, "No, I've seen a vision and he's going to he's God's going to raise him up." He said, "No, all of our medical science said, hey, I'm sorry, guy. You and your little spiritual revelation, this guy's dying." Okay. And according to his scientific knowledge and medical understanding, he is dying. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But now the prophets got a word of the Lord and said, "No, God's going to raise him up." &gt;&gt; And brother Brennan made a a statement. He said, "I'll tell you what, let's do this. If in three days this man is not raised up and back in natural health, I will put a sign on my back. I'm a false prophet and you can run me down the city and honk your horn and put a sign I'm a false prophet and said, "Now, if in three days he is raised up, can I put a sign on your back that you're a a quack doctor?" Hey, I don't want no part of this deal. &gt;&gt; Hey, you talk about the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You bunch of false hypocrite. You want to say, you know, well then you you can if God don't raise him up in three days, I'm a false prophet. And said, but if he does raise him up, you're a quack doctor. I love it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. The ark was God's provided place. Noah was God's provided preacher. His message became God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Can we agree on that? Noah's family were the provided people because he could only he could only persuade his own family. &gt;&gt; 120 years of preaching and he was a good preacher. He could Hey, let me tell you. It's a family affair. Shh, don't tell me it's rigged. Only family is going to believe it because if they're not part of the family of God, guess what? Right over their head. &gt;&gt; Okay? They're gonna miss it. But if they are part of the family, listen, you might run from this and you might not see it clearly and you might have a little hard time uh understanding it. But just hang on. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, this thing's going to slap you upside one day. The light's going to turn on and you're going to go, "Oh, &gt;&gt; bing. light turns on. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to use Matthew 24 very quickly in the scripture. Matthew 24:37-4. But as in the days of Noah, so shall also the coming of the son of man be. So as it was in the days of Noah, so shall here's the type days in the before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying, giving and marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark. sold. Nothing wrong with marrying, giving in marriage, eating, drinking. Nothing wrong with that. We've all done it. People are getting married in marriage. But now watch this. And they knew not verse 39 until the flood came and took them all away. So it wasn't until judgment struck them and they were taken away realized, man, &gt;&gt; he was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch. Then two shall be in the field. The one shall be taken, the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill. One shall be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you know not what hour your Lord doth come. So if because the good men of the house, if he would have known, he would have been ready and wouldn't let it be broke up. Verse uh 44. Therefore be ye also ready. Hey saints, be ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For in such an hour as you think not, the son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season. Now you know the direction I'm going to go Sunday morning. Spiritual food in due season. Who is a wise and faithful pastor, preacher, evangelist, teacher, five-fold ministry who is giving the people and provoking them to get into spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, no, just believe me. I'm the one God sent. You just come here, pay me your tithes, and you know, we come and uh you know, I'll I'll I'll do it for you. I'll do your reading and I'll do your praying. No, I am not your kind old priest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do your homework. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Now, uh Okay, I've got to pass up some of this here. So, I'm going to close here and say this. The messenger came to prepare the way. Prepared your thinking. He prayed prepared your manner of life. And if he did not adjust your manner of life, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; let's just be honest with one another. If your life is not being changed and affected by the ministry of Malachi 4, then you're just sucked along with some kind of movement and it's not revealed to you. Now, uh, brother Bram says, "Present stage of my ministry. letter comes uh all the time. One come the other day said, "Brother Brennan, I had the greatest of confidence in you, but I heard you say a certain denomination which I belong to was backsliding." Said, "I have no more confidence in you at all." Now, from now on, said there's about 25 of the brethren of my denomination sitting in one of your meetings and said, "Well, we just got right up and went off when you said that." They did it to him. They'll do it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make everybody Hey, uh, we're all going. No, do your homework. Find out. I want you to you to answer your own questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, all men hath forsaken me. But there's one thing. He stood by me. One thing. I wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision. What happened down there on the river? I've stayed true to it. He's been true to me. I'm trusting in him someday. I don't know when, for a crowning of my ministry. What do you mean crowning of your ministry? &gt;&gt; When he's ready. I am. Now, look here. I hope he'll crown my ministry with this of letting me take the clothes of the word &gt;&gt; and dress his bride in the clothes of the word and for his righteousness. Dress me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take the word of God and cover me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In God keeps his word 1957. Now, if you'll notice, he said, "As it was in the days of Noah, the days of Noah before the flood, how it would be, and God was not willing that any should perish, but all might come to repentance." Then he suffered long. The flood stage was way past due down in Egypt. It was way past due. Did you get it? In the end of the destruction now, way past due, the destruction and judgment and coming out of Egypt was passed due. 40 years over time. And God was determined, determined that his word would not return to him. He was going to keep his word. He's going to keep his word. He must do it in order to be God. If he has to make a change of everything and by grace he will do it, that's the reason I say if the church does not get herself ready, that's your duty to get ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready. The garments is paid for. &gt;&gt; They are ready. But yet, you must be ready to wear those garments. &gt;&gt; The church has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, are you taking this message and say, "Dress me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is your dress conducive to the Holy Spirit showing you modesty in modest apparel? Not just a dress, a modest dress. You understand? Let me say this. As the Holy Spirit begins to quicken this bride &gt;&gt; to this message, which is the word revealed in its season, &gt;&gt; will she get more holy? &gt;&gt; Yes. Will you be able to see in her walk and her manner of speech and the way she dresses that she's putting away the fashions of mystery Babylon, Babylonian garments, and you might have a long dress on, but what if it's got a slit that comes way up to your thigh? What if you trim your hair just a little bit? Because if a woman trims her hair, let her be short. And he says, "And when a woman cuts her hair, it's a seducing spirit. It's an enticing spirit." And he says, "And you dishonor your head because it was given to you for power because of the angels." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sisters, protect what you got. &gt;&gt; God's given it to you as a covering. My wife one time just after she come into the message and she doesn't like me to use her as an example but maybe I should use your wife as an example but she went she went to oh to we it was way back when you had to light the stove you remember you turn on the gas you light the match you reach in and you turn it on well she turns the gas on the stove puts it down lights a match and it goes out she lights another match it goes out finally lights f now It's been on for five, 10 seconds, right? So now you put in flash. You know what she said? My glory. My glory. &gt;&gt; She wipes her eyebrow. It's gone. Her hair just all singed. You know what? She was worried about my glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't uh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm going to be disfigured or anything like this and oh oh if if we had this kind of sensitivity to our sisters &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says I want you to look nice but not too nice. Don't take your beauty out of Hollywood because the Bible says beauty is deceptive. &gt;&gt; He said take your beauty out of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. of a quiet and gentle spirit. My Okay. Sudden secret catching away. Oh, wait. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is it. 1958, paragraph 28. Some people say, "Well, I go to church on Sunday morning." That's good. I listen to our pastor. That's good. Which is a fine preacher. I hope so. That's good. I appreciate that in you or America, the world, whoever it is. But it takes more than a good message from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; It takes your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes you to get ready. &gt;&gt; Wow. In Revelations the 19th chapter, the 7th verse, the Bible said that speaking of the bride of Christ, she has made herself ready. She made herself ready. And you as a member of this bride, you've got to make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; Musicians, come. I'm on overtime right now. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said, "There was a time when we used to tell you you had to be prayed up every month." &gt;&gt; He said, "Then the time come, you had to be prayed up every week." And he said then the time come you need to be prayed up every hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said actually every day then every hour &gt;&gt; because even the Apostle Paul says I pray without ceasing. &gt;&gt; I don't know about any of you but many times I'm praying throughout the day and I'm just asking God for help. Amen. &gt;&gt; Situation dries up and you know I don't stop. Oh my heavenly father, the God in heaven whom I love. No, I I just am Lord I I need your help. Lord &gt;&gt; I'm having an issue here and I don't really realize but my subconscious is praying without ceasing. I don't even have to say amen. &gt;&gt; Why? because I continue throughout the day relationship. Paragraph 33, same sermon, sudden secret going away of the church. Some time ago, a story just before closing that struck me as I heard it many, many years ago. That secret coming of the Lord, sudden secret going of the church. Wait, it'll be two in a field. I'll take one and leave one. There'll be two in the bed. I'll take one and leave one. Showing that the coming of the Lord will not be just any certain corner, but it'll be universal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One will be in the field working daytime, the other in the bed sleeping on the other side of the world. It'll be a universal rapture. Listen, nobody has exclusive right to say you got to follow this guy, this church, or you're not going to be in it. Do we know anybody within the message that claims if you don't follow them, you're not going to make it? Listen, that's already earmarked their false prophet. &gt;&gt; Mark it down, &gt;&gt; okay? Because it's going to be universal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's not going to be a certain preacher. It's not going to be a certain church location. It's going to be people that are following the Holy Spirit in this day. &gt;&gt; It'll be a universal rapture. It'll come with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise, and she will be caught away secret. Oh, I love that. the bridegroom coming. And the bride got herself ready, waiting for that secret moment that she doesn't even know herself, but she's ready and dressed and waiting for it. For the lamb's wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm asking you, do you judge yourself or are you judging others? Or do you judge your servitude towards God by looking at others who are less than you? I'm glad I'm not as this guy. He don't even come to church on Wednesday. He don't come to church on, you know, we see him once every two or three months. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm not like that guy. Well, remember as you meet others, it's going to be meant to you. &gt;&gt; Let's judge yourselves. [Music] &gt;&gt; You point your hand out there with a finger at somebody, you got three pointing back at you. Let me not be a phariseical believer in this end time. Let me not be an actor of this message. [Music] Let me be a true believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me love God with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just know what's right to do and then I don't do it. &gt;&gt; Because what good is it to see yourself in the mirror of the word and straightway you go and forget what manner of man you are. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why saints of God, this is a Wednesday night. Thank God for Wednesday nights. And I thank God for every one of you. Yes, I would love to have the church as full on Wednesday night as it is on Sunday morning, but that's just not going to happen. Many are working. Many it's so far for them to travel and everything. I understand it. So, I will say to you that are here tonight, I honor you that you are here. We're not going to put down the others that are not here because it may be a legitimate excuse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I honor you because here on a Wednesday night, you might have had a rough day. You might have been busy. You might have had all hell break loose in your day. And you just h I got home and my job and the people and the traffic and my kids and my wife and my dog and my bank account and you ever had one of them days everything just falls apart. Well, it's okay. It's good for you. Life is not a bed of roses. Life is trials, tribulations, testings. Brother Brim said, "There will not be a son or daughter of God that makes it to heaven except that they went through the trials and the testings." And sometimes God is going to test you by looking like he forgot you. He didn't answer your prayer because he wants to see your reaction to his action. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if that's the way he's going to be, I prayed last night and I didn't get the job offer today. If that's the way God is because he told me, if you say anything in my name, I'll give it to you. I did. I said it in your name, Lord. I said it. How many people are that way with God? Sometimes he holds it back. He wants to see what kind of reaction you're going to get. &gt;&gt; Well, if that's the way he is, God don't owe any of us an answer on anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham got mad at God one time. He said, "God, you owe me an answer." He says for about six months he said I didn't feel his presence. He didn't come by. And finally he he recognized that he had said something that wasn't pleasing to God. He said, "God, I'm sorry. You don't owe me nothing." &gt;&gt; He says, "Then when his attitude got right and all of a sudden he said, then Holy Spirit said, "You remember that girl you prayed for?" and on and on told him. [Music] It was a tiny simple stable allbe [Music] for a king to be born. &gt;&gt; Little bit faster now. Choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I give him control that he'll be born in me. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live with me. There is God [Music] living inside this house of &gt;&gt; and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Outwardly I'm nothing. [Music] Outwardly nothing, &gt;&gt; not much to behold, unlikely a place for his worth. But if I just my vessel and let him have his way [Music] to change me [Music] [Music] in the manger of my Let it live in me. Let it live inside this house and clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, thank you. Thank you for your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the correction of the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, that you told us that the bride would make herself ready. Therefore, Father, it's not upon the preacher. It's not upon the prophet or the church. It depends on us. Each one personal. I put it back on everyone who is here tonight. Whether it be the seen audience or the unseen, it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're not doing like you should do, would you humble yourself and say, "Father, help me to be better. &gt;&gt; Help me to be obedient. &gt;&gt; I've been a little slack. I've been a Yeah, I haven't done what I should do. Therefore, Father, &gt;&gt; I pray, &gt;&gt; be patient with me, Lord, &gt;&gt; because I'm human and humans, we make mistakes. And oh, Lord, I can't wait for the day when I'm totally changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And until that day, Father, we're going to have we're going to have ups and downs and trials and testings. But Father, in the end, if our spirit is right and our heart is right and we're prepared at your coming. Because if we're not prepared, comes a disaster. If a nation is not prepared for war, then shall come sudden destruction. If the people are not prepared for your coming, they're going to miss it. Therefore, Father, I pray each one may say within their heart right now, judging themsel, help me to prepare myself. Let me take the responsibility &gt;&gt; on the way I live and the things that I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for coming to the house of the Lord tonight to be here. It's 9:29. It's almost 9:30. And I realize on Wednesday nights, uh, I know many of you drive long ways, okay? Sister Lynn Merchant, she comes all the way from Maricopa, hour and 45 minutes, and she drives alone. [Music] There are people, you know, and then there are some people that listen, if we go into overtime, ah, I got to go to work. Who doesn't? Who's not too busy? We're all busy. You've all got jobs. You all got things to do. You've all got f Now, you're not all married and everything, but those of you that do, you got a wife and family and kids and a mortgage and a house payment and a car payment. I got to pay gas. Yeah, I realize all those things. But sometimes we go into overtime. &gt;&gt; It's good for you. Sometimes you sometimes your boss will make you stay and you have to work overtime. Are you going to get in his face and say, "I'll tell you what, you got no right to hire me overtime. I won't go home." Well, I'll tell you what, you'll probably get a paycheck the next week and say, "Adios, amigo." Okay? Because there are some times that you you got to work overtime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are some times when the preacher goes into overtime. Do you think if he holds you a little bit and I'm not going to hold you any longer and you said, "Lord, I'm so tired. I'd like to go home, but out of respect to you and your word, I'm going to stay here and I'm going to wait and I'm going to take a moment. I'm not going to be so worried about my job and whether I get the sleep or something because most of the time you're not sleeping when you should sleep because you'll go home, you'll get on your iPad, you'll this and that, you'll Facebook, you'll get Instagram and and you'll spend all that time when you could have given God not so quick to Okay, I love you guys. &gt;&gt; Love you, brother. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, God bless you. Wednesday night, I'm going to dismiss you. We're not going to sing any more songs. We've sung enough. You've heard the word. How many say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Shake one another's hand and say, "God bless you. I'll see you Sunday." &gt;&gt; You are dismissed in the name of the Lord. Drive careful. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Oh, you [Music] Oh yeah. Oh, [Music] [Applause] heat. [Music] Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music]
