Me [Music] blessing and honor and glory and power onise can you say Amen on [Applause] that blessing and power and glory amen amen God bless you all we greet you this morning in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen our Lord and savior I'd like you to remain standing let's go directly to the word I have quite a bit this morning here we'll see how far we get through it thank you musicians God bless you uh turn with me if you would to Luke 17 Luke 17 then we'll go to Luke 21 1 Peter chapter 1 amen now somebody was saying the other day brother Ron what is revelation Revelation is God taking his thoughts and made known to you thank you Lord without it your Bible is a closed book without it you do not understand without it you become religious and you could be taught through an intellectual understanding um about God about his precepts and everything and that's why people many people become religious they go to churches light candles they say prayers they recite prayers and they have no relationship with him amen and yet they're religious I want to be a Christian without being religious can you say amen amen I want a relationship with God where I understand him and uh understand that the Bible has many types and shadows they're not just stories there an actual event that happened and when you see that event and what happened it sets a pattern it gives a shadow brother Brenham said the New Testament is enfolded into the Old Testament so what you do is you look at the Old Testament and you see types and shadows and brother BR said if you see a hand and it leaves a shadow whatever the Shadow does when this hand gets closer to it the two of them are going to be the same you're not going to have four fingers here and five there that's right yeah so the reason that brother Brenham said I'm a typologist as he says I see what God did back there and the Bible tells me he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore if I see and understand the pattern of what he did back there I can tell what he's going to do in the future future amen thank you Lord amen amen and um so Revelation to you is more important than you perhaps realize because without it your Bible is a dead letter that's right that's right it is a dead letter the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so we need the Holy Spirit to Quicken this word to it and that quickening power transforms you makes you different if you go to church and it's not changing you I've often said change your church because what you need to do is have something that quickens you that changes you from what you are and makes you a new creature in Christ amen all right here we are Luke 17 vers 28 and 30 again it's going to take a type and a shadow here likewise also as it when the as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even the thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed there is a type in a shadow we'll go into that here in just a little bit let's just pray heavenly father as we have read your word we understand father it is a closed book a carnal mind is enity with God neither can it know God but once we are born again we are um privileged we're in a initiated people we're a people that you share your thoughts with and a servant as long as he remains a servant is no different than others though he be born Lord of all so we need you Lord to move us from servants to friends because friends then understand what to master doeth father I thank you may we all here be called the friends of God I pray now for your blessing upon the word inspire us from on high give us the Holy Spirit anointing I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated but let's uh uh because the scripture reading is a little bit lengthy I allow you to sit down although I remain standing it's okay I always like to say that because it's true um Luke chapter 21 and verses 2 5- 28 Luke 21 and verse 25 and thereby she there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity in other words all of the these things are happening signs are given brother Brenham shares with us and he says all of these are a sign it's a flashing red light but though they see the signs they don't understand it's it's with perplexity why is this happening so they're looking at it with perplexity there's no understanding by seeing the sign alone right unless God gives you an understanding of what these signs are for thank you Lord okay so we go on and the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory now separate this coming of of him in a cloud because we know there is a second coming where he comes in the clouds and everyone sees that coming but this one is a secret only to the elect only to those who have eyes to see ears to hear begin to catch what God is doing in this hour and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh can we say Amen to that so those things are to just make you aware I'm coming I'm coming now those that just see signs only don't prepare they do not turn with me if you would back to First Peter 1 vers 19- 16 I said 19 9 through 16 if you back up there for just a second I did not give the Brethren but you that have your Bible it's there written in verse 5 who are kept by the power of God through faith amen how are you kept you don't keep yourself that's right well if I if I do all of The Commandments and if I study and I know the Greek the Hebrew and I have this good understanding I'll keep myself yeah you keep yourself about a half hour and then you find out that that you can't you can't keep your but God keeps you by his power through faith every one of you are given a Measure of Faith and if you don't have it's CU you didn't ask for it it is something that you ask if you seek you shall find if you ask it shall be given but I want to say that lying within every elect seed Gene of God there is an ability it's inherent it's not something that you actually prayed for or sought after but there is an inherent ability to hear what the spirit is saying to the church than it just was there it's hardwired into your Gene s okay and all of a sudden whether you're a young person or it takes a while brother Bram said a true seed of God can go a long time before he recognizes who he is right so some of you are slower than others it's a proof in school some of you are very fast Learners some of you catch it some of you the teacher has to just teach it one time I got it go on others repetition repetition and they just pass them because they otherwise there'd be 20 year olds in third grade they just don't get it so they just kind of pass them on yeah good maybe you'll be good in basketball so anyway so uh 1 Peter 1 n and n told you uh who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time so you're kept by the power of God to be revealed in the last time are we there amen so Revelation is what God is continuing to do wherein you greatly Rejoice through now for a season if need be you in heaviness through manifold Temptations every one of us realize that we're being tried by our faith now let's go to verse n receiving the end of your faith what is the end of your faith the faith is taking you somewhere it will produce something and it's a goal receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls may I say this that the salvation of your souls the quickening power in this end time and the catching away of the Bride is greater than the creation itself because this this is the culmination of why he created that's right Hallelujah this is the cresendo this is you see in the beginning God created that's good wonderful created the trees and the Sun the moon and everything but he did it for a purpose that he might bring man back to himself we understand as type Shadows but you see as a mighty burst of Illumination comes forth as many of us in the Fourth of July we go out watch the fire bks uh fireworks and you know what we all kind of enjoy it and you have this little spinning wheels and sh this and that and then you got little ones that you go like this and boom boom but everyone loves the finale yeah the finale is all a sudden like this and we all go o yeah well that's what's happening right now that's why all of these events that's why all of the Sun the moon the stars the tsunamis the earthquakes all of this uh Putin uh China Russia all of this and all of this that's going on do not get distracted by all of these signs that are going off otherwise you look just at the signs and fail to realize there's a purpose why it's happening and that is look up Hallelujah because something is Drawing Near if you fail to catch that you just stand there and watch all of the fireworks and then you get it burnt up with them at the end also you don't want that that's right we want to get out of here amen amen thank you Lord receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of our souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired watch this and searched diligently so prophets inspired by God say things they don't understand Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child whoa after he said it he thought did I say that a virgin never in the history of mankind has a virgin conceived and bring forth a child oh my and I'm sure everybody around looked at Isaiah and said really now he said that prophecy without man understanding it God brings his word to pass in season am and so it Pro that prophecy hovered around the earth until the season there had to be a season appointed time for a recipient to receive it and when it did guess what the this day this scripture is fulfilled amen now so they inquired and searched diligently verse 10 who prophesied of the grace that should come on un to you so they prophesied it but guess what it's a recipient Not only was it for them but it was for you thank you Lord searching what or what manner of time that the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow to whom it was revealed again Revelation is revealing god making something known it's an understanding that only God can give you amen unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister these things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel go El unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven and which things the Angels desire to look into Now understand even the angels of heaven don't know how and when he's coming Jesus said neither did the son amen he said I have no idea he says but it will be revealed in its season verse 13 wherefore G up the lines of your mind to be sober and to the hope and hope to the end for the grace which is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning ourselves according to the former lust and or ignorance but as he which is hath called you as holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy amen so we realize that we must be holy as he is Holy now it's not something that we put on Holiness is something that God gives you it's revealed to you it is and the Bible says without holy no man shall see God Amen therefore in every age God gave them a measure of something for them to understand that what God was expecting now in this age which has become the darkest of all ages where seducing spirits and all kinds of doctrines of devils and times is going to get worse and worse the the word of God has been compromised it has been interpreted until wow who are we going to believe they're all we we have over a thousand different kinds of denominations all reading the same Bible which one's right they can't all be right because the Luthers don't agree with the wesan wesan don't agree with the Pentecostals Pentecostals don't even agree with themselves if we're not careful we as message believer start arguing doing the same thing and the next thing we're broke up into all kinds of things but the Bible says until we come to the unity of the faith amen and faith is revelation the only way you can become unified is say what he said well this is what I believe he said well that's where the division start and Paul said uh I uh am so upset with you he said because look one of you says I'm of Paul and another said I'm of apollis and in the very first First Church ages the first few years what is it even 50 years and and the Ephesian Church who many of the disciples saw Christ they they walked with him and it wasn't but a short time and Peter's trying to make the Gentiles Jews amen trying to get them all circumcised so God's got to send a messenger okay a man born out of due season a man who religiously religiously was following religious teachings and the laws of Moses and he was persecuting the church understand that the law of God and the Commandments of God void of Revelation makes you religious amen Saul the Pharisee therefore was persecuting the church even killing them putting them into prison and uh he didn't have a revelation of God his eyes were blinded by intellectual teaching so God had to Blind his eyes to open his eyes I hope none of you are sitting here blinded by religion and you fail to see the God within the Bible because you find out that Revelation is making the mystery of God known through Jesus Christ because you'll never know God unless you know it through Jesus Christ Jesus says I didn't come to reveal myself I came to reveal the Father the Son can do nothing except the father revealing well well Jesus uh please show us the father oh my have I been so long with you have I preached so many many sermons that you haven't recognized that if you see me you've seen the father because I and the father are one Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily now God doing something in their midst doesn't make them all automatically see it because you could have an angel standing behind this Pulpit you could have a dynamic Supernatural move of of God and some of you would say that was just a man and another would say wow I saw it was God Amen so we understand that God can do something but not everybody see it all right so I would like to take my sermon title for this morning and I realize that the revealing of the son of man is an unending sermon it continues the mystery continues the ministry continues and the voice continues God never leaves an age or a group of people without a representative of his on the earth that's the type and the shadow if you understand the type the Shadow and you catch the pattern it's like you that have ever studied mathematics you start in mathematics by just multiplication and division and adding and subtracting once you understand the formul 2 + 2 = 4 then we can do the subtraction that 2 - 4 - 2 is 2 if you know the formula you know the answer to each one of those you begin to catch it if you miss miss the formula then you're the student that is there being taught though the teacher is teaching eloquently and putting it here and up there you are glad that somebody in the class because the teacher will say do you all understand it and none of you want to be act like the dummy so you're going no I don't but I don't want to raise my hand and then some Joe Blow in the back of the class would you say it again and you exhale very nice thank you he looks dumb I don't but I sit here I sit here still with that same I don't understand it now understand that when a word of God is teached let me go into this also for just a moment when the word of God is preached sometimes it's according to your maturity level in Christ whether or not you grasp it although you will get something out of the sermon because obviously if the if the minister talks about the love of God and you are of a new baby in Christ basically you're only going to get oh God loves me oh thank you as babies come into the world the first thing when they come out of the hospital and they come to church and they come to family you hand it to everybody and they kiss and make love to that little baby the baby that's all it knows just love the sincere milk of the word just tell me about love God loves me oh I love that then you start growing up you realize that God does love you okay that's good you you know and uh Mama finally puts you down makes you walk well no if you love me Mama come on carry me the rest of my life come on no walk kid getting too heavy you're in third great already and you're still asking me to carry you around forget it you see sometimes you mothers mother too much amen yeah you don't let the kids you know Hey listen they don't have to be petted and pampered and done everything for them they can learn to tie their own shoes you remember when you learned to tie your own shoe it was great my sister taught me my parents didn't my sister yeah take it like this put it over the rabbit goes through the hole I got it I've been tying my shoes ever since but now because of back problems and Battle of the Bulge I do slip on shoes yeah it's kind of fun you don't have to time you can just kick them off reach over and then slip down into the shoes but what I'm seeing you begin now to have to work things out yourself Mama doesn't do everything for you and we as a church do not need to keep our young ones young we expect them to grow amen we expect them to have responsibility because growing is responsibility going to school is responsibility the older you get more responsibility and as long as you can handle that responsibility and you show that you can do it Daddy Daddy I want to go play it to Park okay be back by 6:00 if he's not back until 7:00 guess what responsibility shows that he wasn't mature enough to be back by six do you understand there are some children that learn quicker than others and they'll take the responsibility others have a hard time growing up now I want to title my sermon this morning the revealing of the son of man brings deliverance and judgment it has in every age and will again in this end time so when the son of man appears whenever you see a move of God it's going to deliver one and bring judgment to another amen doesn't mean that God is unfair he gives everyone an equal opportunity in fact he gives all of you free moral agency and he says you can pick or Cho you see I believe I don't believe God doesn't Force you God allows you to make that choice amen so I want to take uh a subject this morning of recognizing your day in its message now I cannot overemphasize understanding the fact that unless you catch the message in this hour which is the way of Escape you'll stay here go through the tribulation and you're going to have a hard time if you miss the Elijah prophesied for this day you will see the next one I can promise you it will be globally on International television the two prophets coming to Israel they will be in the flesh they will be there Moses and Elijah are going to be back on the scene and when they do they're going to they're going to do the same type thing that they did when they were here on Earth they're going to they're going to create all kinds of plagues and and people will hate them the only ones that will receive those two prophets is an ordained predestinated group of people called the 144,000 so God finishes with the Gentiles there's a Rapture that goes up the two prophets come down time of trouble and tribulation starts but God's dealing with the Jews no longer the Gentiles cuz the days of the Gentiles finished fulfilled cuz that's why he sent Elijah in this hour to finish the mystery amen okay so uh I want to continue on and again I I I I I want to go slowly though I have an awful lot I want you to understand that when we speak about a message of the hour and when we speak about being in Christ you can't speak to everyone okay it's not to everyone exactly it's the elected for ordained predestinated and unless you are predestinated you hear the same word goes right over your head you got no idea there's no concept now uh again um as it's been in every age there's always a revelation or a faith that is being ministered at that at that age that time that season it's an appointed time and it's directed to the elect although it's spoken as though everyone will hear it not everyone will hear it amen for Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won follow is that right that's right so um there's always a revelation that's going forth and those that are called to and predestined ated to it are going to catch it those those void of revelation will produce religion Adam hid himself remember in the garden and we're going to do some types and shadows here in just a moment and he created a religious covering of fig leaves religion is a covering men are not exposing their guilt to God when they come and light a candle they're creating a religion they're saying prayers Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done and they say their prayer and they say their heal mares and they light a candle and they become religious you see the people walking in the first time I ever walked into a church my friend Joe Zino Catholic Family Spanish and you Joe couldn't go anywhere on Sunday until he went to church so they had an early Mass hey great let's go Joe so my sister said you're going to mass you have to have a um the beads a rosary and she had it in a box with the the nice uh you know fluffy white cotton stuff in there and it's like this and and here's how you hold it wow she gave me something to hold and and and actually quite honestly when I held the rosary I felt a little religious never done but wow you know and so she said so I watched okay you see monkey see monkey do if you go to church and you see others why do they do this why do they genuflect before they enter into the Pew why is it they touch themselves with the holy water why is it that they have the little form and and the priest says something and then they repeat and you just go over and over and everything so I did everything Joe did and quite honestly when he put his hand in the water uh and he did this I did it too and I have to be honest with you I felt religious I thought o there there is something about this and so I was excited and and and I know I've told you the story but um I was excited to hear something because the only time I ever heard the name of Jesus Christ first time I was 9 years old went to Green Oak Ranch boys Camp my parents got rid of my twin brother and I for 5 days and sent us to a camp and I all I knew is it was going to be fun you got to shoot bow and arrows you got to ride on the little tiny train they had and you got to paint pictures and all this stuff so I couldn't wait we went there and I remember them saying something about Jesus Christ uh and Jesus Christ was a cuss word in our home it uh they said it all the time you know it's an amazing the Bible says that we shall not say the name of the Lord in vain right you know and yet everybody in the world everybody in many religions they get upset they hit the hammer on their nail and they use the name of the Lord in vain they don't say oh Muhammad oh Buddha they they just don't why don't they it's not really the name of the Lord so Satan does everything he could to try to discredit the name of God and so I had never heard of Jesus Christ never read a Bible never owned a Bible and they said any of you that want to come forward and give your life to God and get a new testament pocket Bible I didn't hear about born again I didn't hear about any of that all I heard is new Bible you want one come forward I came forward and so they handed them out to everybody I I loved it I was great I've never read the Bible I opened it up up and I have no idea uh Matthew Mark Luke John uh can't relate to any of those oh here's Romans Demetrius and the Gladiators Romans spartus I've seen the movies I want to read about Romans and I go in there and I start reading and I'll never forget I put on the front of the Bible this Bible was given to Ron Peterson Greeno Ranch boys Camp I put the date because he was born again I had no idea what Born Again meant and I wouldn't know until much later but it wasn't until I went with Joe Zino to a Catholic Church thousands of people we went on an early mass and I thought I I I I was quite excited I want to hear about Jesus and he spoke in in Latin any of you Catholics ever been to a mass where they speak in Latin and and you I felt cheated I I told Joe Joe I don't speak Latin why well we're not holy enough to hear God's word so therefore and I thought well that's why I'm here because I want to hear what he said so I can be better but if he speaks in Latin I uh he speaks unto me in an unknown tongue and to me he's a barbarian amen is that what the Bible said better with five words that I might know okay so here we go types and shadows when you begin to see that God does something in the beginning he creates and he keeps doing the scenario over and over again he just changes the face he changes the scenario a little bit God in morphit changes his mask and it's the identified Christ down through all the ages now it didn't say the identified Jesus Jesus was the man amen amen that the Christ Came Upon you follow me but if we understand the Christ of God because one day Philip went to Nathaniel and said hey we have found of he who is written and the scriptures and we have found a man that comes out of Nazareth and of course his brother said can any good thing come out of Nazareth right and he just said come and see and you find out that when he came he said behold an Israelite in whom there is no gu when did you know me now you you have to understand when you as a son or daughter of God come to him you don't know him but he will reveal himself he'll do something to you to all of a sudden say whoa when did you know me and all of a sudden when he tells him these things he said you're a rabbi you're a man that came from God and he he says as his brother Philip had told Nathaniel we have found the Christ of God we have found the anointing understand that this anointing follows all the way from Genesis into Exodus Leviticus Deuteronomy goes on and on and on and there's all kinds of actors and players in this play the scene changes it's new actors it's new players but the Christ of God is the one doing the acting he is the script he's the melody and he's causing amen scene five enter Isaiah and Isaiah begins to now play A Part what is it the Christ of God in him amen he doesn't know why he's doing it but he's being led by an anointing that anointing is the identified Christ of all the ages he said it was Christ in David who did what he did it was Christ in Isaiah Ezekiel he goes through all of the prophets and he begins to identify that's the Christ now let's bring it down to our day the reason you are doing and following what you are following is because it's the Christ the mystery of God in you causing you and if you don't have the Christ of God anoint in you you miss it amen what's relevant what is revelation all about it's understanding the thought well I don't get it it's just Creeds dogmas long hair long dress I'm just going along with the flow that's cuz and if you're not careful that becomes religious then we make a paper cutter cookie cutter and we just stamp the Bible says be ye not conformed that's right but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind there are people that have for years just kind of followed along and because they were taught and because they were born into it it becomes a way of life it becomes religion and we become the Amish of our day you understand that amen people look at us oh you're a cult long hair and everything you see uh they see you walking down the mall they look at you like whoa what is this alien doing the longer that we serve God in this age the more alien we will appear to those cuz you know what my kingdom is not of this Cosmos that's right I have another and he's going to shake heaven and earth once more amen and understand that all of these things that are happening are signs why the blood moons why all of these things that are happening why the tsunamis why the governments falling apart why is fear coming upon the people why are there more neurotics now they're saying children are becoming neurotics cuz parents are pushing them into it and you know what one of the quickest way to make your child a psychotic and neurotic and and everything give them a cell phone that little blue light will Mesmerize them then they'll have friends then they'll have Instagram then they'll have Facebook even those who invented it wouldn't allow their own Teenage children to have it until much later they real realize how quickly it can consume the mind of young young people it is a device of Satan can you say Amen of that you should be 21 or old be before they even allow you to buy one it's worse than cigarettes worse than alcohol oh well let a babysitter uh-huh give it to your kids it'll babysit them all right it'll consume their mind next thing you know they want to be doing everything that they see on that I remember watching Superman as a kid faster and a speeding bullet able to leap over big buildings with a single pound you know faster than a speeding bullet yeah man hey you know what it was the cape I decided it was the cape I went in I told my mom mom she cut up an old sheet and then she bound it together she put a pin here and everything I ran around the yard Superman Superman I so I got my twin brother he always knew I was nuts I got on top of our Pontiac station wagon I said okay guys I'm going to fly now I've never flown before but I'm going to fly and get out of the way just just watch me as I go by I don't know how fast how far I'm going to go but just watch and now in my mind in my mind I'm going to fly cuz Superman does that's the cape so I got up there you guys ready they're all looking at me some smiling real big and I spread out there like that and I hit the ground you ever done the belly flop on the ground I exhale for about 2 minutes I was so disappointed because I thought I would fly how much time are the things that have been brought to your little innocent mind did you think if I do what they do I'll have the same results it doesn't happen not real anyway so now watch these because in the beginning God created through the evolution of his mind he spoke and it came into manifestation so all things were created for him and by him and without him there's nothing that was created good and bad seed and nonseed I'll show you that in scripture now um brother brenon picks us up in saman church age follow along with me now now then we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and Jesus dwelt in all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became a many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest Ed in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called now this is in capital in your seven Church AG book I did not capitalize this we did not become seed by the rebirth that's a Pentecostal teaching we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed amen hallelujah and therefore we're reborn for only the elect somebody say only the [Music] elect wait a second this is amazing for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed amen is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed right there's nothing to Quicken now we can take a rock and a plant and put him both outside and the Sun and the rain falls on both the Rock and the plant but there is one that's going to be quickened by the sun and the rain and it's going to come to life that's because of the law of the life that's in the seed in The Rock he understands the same conditions but guess what he just feels the anointing oh the sun it feels so good how many people go to church oh I just felt so good maybe me feel holy oh the warm sunlight oo I love it tell me about God's love or the rain falls on it and oh that was such an anointing okay they feel that but does nothing to the Rock why no seed right they feel it on the outside but it doesn't change them on the inside only those ordained to life will catch it because only the elect can be reborn so let's look at the pattern God created an Eden in the beginning for man to live in that's God's Garden in fact Eden is called God's garden and where do you plant your crop in a garden so God took the first human beings that he planted and he put them in Eden man woman but let's just take the woman for a moment because the woman in the Bible is a church the woman was made for the man not the man for the woman the woman was given to the man that he might procreate and he might replenish the Earth let me throw you a curveball here for just a second do you know we are not the first to inhabit Tera Firma called Earth do you know that brother Brenham said there were civilizations and peoples before us and he says so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and he and when God creates everything he doesn't make it chaos cuz God's not chaos there's no confusion in God God made the Earth but then the Earth Earth became without form and void God destroyed the early civilization and said wipe it off that's why when Rebecca said but we've been taught in school that he says that that that there's all kinds of uh civilizations and Bones of people and prehistoric and all this kind of stuff daddy it just shows the Bible's wrong he said no because between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 you put a period he said right there there could have been millions of years amen so he says that's why he told Adam go and replenish the Earth replenish means put back man back on the Earth again that's right that's a whole another sermon and I just threw you a curveball well you just keep swinging and when you get in the batter's box I'll throw a slider but that's why he these are Mysteries that's why the Bible has our answers so now God he creates he creates a woman so now watch in the Old Testament the Old Testament begins with a woman a virgin but before the man and woman could come together to procreate and they're not going to procreate by sex because God never used sex to make anything that's an animal act amen because he was the Beast of the field he was a serpent that's what he was he walked upright like man there's your Missing Link God knows the difference between a beast and a reptile it wasn't until after okay serpent because thou has done this upon thy belly Thou shalt crawl so God changed him from a beast that could and did mingle with man and woman and so you have a woman of Virgin in an Eden and the one that visits her gives to her and defiles her womb with a wrong seed amen she goes to Adam guess what I got she shows next thing you know he being a type of Christ redeems her and gives her seed also so now in the woman is two seeds elect seed and nonseed now to show you the pattern and the type that the two of them want to go to church and so God they want to worship god brother Ram said you look at Nations and countries and people it don't matter what color skin they got no matter what geographic location the Aborigines in Australia the eskimos in Alaska anywhere the Native American here in America they have to the great spirit man was made to worship something it's inherent so here's the first two created and they want to worship God they want to go to church so they start building altars and Cain he actually comes and he builds a big beautiful altar what was it he put on his altar fruit of the field do you realize that if you go back in the Book of Genesis and you find out because thou Hast done this Adam and Eve I am not going to curse Adam I'm going to curse the ground and ground you will not bring the full fruition of the fruit no more I'm going to curse the ground among thistles and Thorns amen so the ground was already cursed so what does he do he's void of Revelation he takes something cursed gives it back to God that's what Voodoo people do that's what these ones that they want to worship ship God they M an altar they take the alcohol the whiskey we pour it out to the god of voodoo we do and they cut they have the blood they do this right void of Revelation but they have to do something to worship do you think God's in that no does he accept it no but they do it are they sincere do they get all worked up do they work themselves up into an emotion and they do do a little whirly durly and next thing you know and some kind of chant if you ain't ever been around one I tell you it's it's something different now I that's another story but I've told you before I've seen witches and W Witch Doctors I've seen them speak in tongues I've seen them we had a we were on the reservation sorry I opened the we were out framing houses on the reservation a flash flood I've never seen a flash flood in the state of Arizona I saw one that day it was raining so hard so many inches of rain coming on the namaho reservation we're out there we're framing I said hey Marvin we got to go man let's we load up we put all our stuff in the back we had a big old uh dump truck we threw it all our tools and everything threw it in the back of the truck and we head out well guess what we're going and wind she wipers like this and it's getting muddy and we're slipping and sliding I said Marvin what is that what is that the trees are exploding it's a wall of water coming across flat desert a 6- foot wall of water coming across the desert and when it hits the cacti and it hits the sorro and it hits the juniper trees and all of this guess what if you've ever seen water come rushing it hits and splashes and I don't realize I've never seen it before and so all of a sudden we get caught in a 6ot wall of water anyway we left the truck we walked for several miles uh Marvin was a big old guy about 325 lbs brand new Levis and we tried walking out we we went through the flooded water we got to the side we're walking and now Marvin he's a big guy you ever been with a big guy his legs they touch together brand new Levis are wet you ever walked in wet Levis for a long time ah Ron I can't go any further my legs are raw he pulled his pants down his legs from touching together are raw oh I said Marvin okay we're going to have now the rain quit let's go back to the truck so we man we got back there he said another 40 ft I couldn't have made it another 40 ft anyway anyway we we get there in the truck we see guess what there's truck tire marks in the mud next to our truck oh somebody come somebody came to rescue us they didn't come to rescue us they come to rescue our tools right stole all our tools we had a brand new mlow uh gas powerered compressor those of you in construction wow anyway they still are all of this stuff we're bummed out man I tell you Marvin who owned the truck and he owned the tools except for the rest of the power tools we're bummed out anyway we get the truck started we get off the reservation come back the next day and one of my friends Henry King his mother is a Navajo handshaker Navajo handshaker you guys ever heard of the hand shakers like a medicine woman I got no idea is a handshaker somebody shakes your hand I don't know and Mr King who was in the first wave of Normandy he was a casualty of the the second world war Normandy he stormed Omaha Beach he's missing this finger 50 caliber took this finger out they sewed it together and when you see his hand you can't really notice it but he didn't even remember getting hit boom his finger's gone he's out there fighting he gets up on the shore gets a bullet to the helmet went through the metal helmet into the this and went into his skull and he went unconscious and they couldn't take the bullet out of him uh because of that part of the brain without making him uh a paraplegic or something so they left the bullet in there but Mr King you don't ask him anything about the war cuz once in a while he he just all of a sudden digresses so I didn't know uh Mr King I heard you were on Normandy you you were on the first wave you went in there and you were fighting the Germans you got shot what happened get my gun he runs into his house and he gets his gun and the whole family everybody starts scattering no no because he just relives it he'd been through that traumatic time anyway yeah so we finally got him calmed down no it's not Normandy and everything okay well we had told him Mr King we saw him the next day at the Navajo Trading Post we got gas we're getting gas here's Mr King hello Ron how you do yeah I'm having a bad day why you have a bad day compressor stolen so I stole compressor you come to Hogan Helen my wife she do handshake she find your compressor Marvin and I looked at one another let's try it right so we went there went into the Hogan sat down it's a it's a Navajo Hogan it's got a circle where the smoke goes out in the center and they build a fire and stuff so anyway here we are it's a it's a it's a uh not wooden it's a earth and floor so they say sit down on the floor but before we sit down she takes some some some uh deer skins puts on the the ground for you so you don't have to sit on the dir she puts it there and then she she goes into the other uh Hogan comes back and she's got a little uh pouch like an old tobacco pouch she pulls it open Marvin and I sitting there here's little o me and Marvin big oh him and she's going and she's taking this and she's sprinkling it over see I can feel the stuff hitting me and like this in in Marvin it's funny he's going the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus she she sits on the floor in front of us have you ever seen somebody going into a trance and she starts her hand shaking that's why they call it a hand Shaker hey no her eyes are closed like this and she she draws something on this on the ground her eyes are still closed she wipes it she's writing and erasing and everything I know five things I know the man who stole it I know where he lives I know where he's taking it to sell it he's putting too high of a price on it and you'll get it back this evening Marvin is going we found a prophetess in the land he said but we better go check it out if this is real I know his name I know where he lives well get in the truck Navajo women don't ride in the truck on the reservation with the men and have you been there the old squa sits in the back pretty good idea anyway anyway I thought you'd enjoy that your sisters didn't find it funny at all and she's tapping on a deal telling us turn love reservation got no sign this road that road we drive up in front of another Hogan here's about five or seven Navajo Indians standing there because this truck they've never seen come up their long driveway what is this white man doing what so we come we get out and he's excited and the name of the man who stole it his name was Marvin also only it was Marvin beay not Marvin Bailey so he jumps out of the truck here's this big heavy sck guy Marvin stole my compressor and I want it back and they said no Marvin don't live here no idea what you talk about broken English Marvin says yes I know he lives here and you better get it back to me and I want you know just throw like this and they keep denying no no white man crazy you go and then Helen stands up in the back of the truck they all shut up she goes know know and she now in Navajo tells him yeah he stole it the like that and they all said yeah yeah yeah he stole it he went to Window Rock he tried to sell it and we don't know when he's coming back well what happened we said okay you have him bring it to us we went to the to Helen and and and uh Henry King we went to their Hogan we sat there and we waited and we waited until dark it started raining it's horrible we're in a big monster truck four-wheel drive not the diesel we're in a big truck with a big knobby tires and so we said hey it's raining really bad we better get out of here we get in that thing and these this big old truck starts throwing mud all over the truck if you've ever been uh and and so we can't see out of the view mirror this is the truck is just getting full of mud we're slipping and sliding in four-wheel drive and I look and there's a small little patch on my side on my mirror that doesn't have mud and I can see headlights of somebody behind flashing their and it's catching on us here is Mr King two wheeel drive pickup long wheel base and he's catching us and we're in a four-wheel drive anyway way we stop Mr King hey I have compressor then he so we got the compressor five out of five don't tell me the spirits don't know brother Bram said I've seen witches and WG witchard Wizards drink out of a human skull prophesy and it be right and he says and interpret what yeah he goes on hey so I've seen in the spirit realm okay of what people can do and you know what she knew she went into that realm she was the most famous handshaker on the Navajo reservation I did a little deed to her here just excuse me um I'll come back I'm I'm showing types and shadows so Old Testament starts with a woman a virgin in Eden has a visitor serpent gets wrong seed brings forth two children children they then bring their offerings God says one I refuse it's wrong and what does Cain do he gets mad what does the modernday man do when he gives God a sacrifice when he lights candles when he says the rosary when he does all this kind of stuff and if God tells him I don't receive receive it he gets mad well then I'll quit your church because he's void of Revelation and to the other one Abel God says I receive it why I want to ask you what was it that caused able to present a more acceptable sacrifice than that of Cain Revelation what was it he offered a bloody lamb you see all of a sudden as he's he's he's worshiping God what what what what a lamb I saw a bloody lamb his offering wasn't pretty he ties up a lamb if any of you have ever seen an animal killed and you and there on that reservation we saw Mrs King kill a lamb in front of us and we had a lamb feast and she took the the lamb tied it up and she comes over and takes a a knife and cuts it throat and the Lamb's going and the blood squirting it's not a pretty sight and Abel lays his hand on a bloody lamb and the lamb becomes his sacrifice and God said I receive it here is one void and here is one that catches something so now we understand by types and shadows because the New Testament begins with a woman in Eden but it's not in God's Eden it's in Satan's Eden but she has a visitor also but this visitor is an angel sent from God and she says but how will these things be it said it won't be by sex birth it'll be by a holy ghost conception and that which is born in you will be of the Holy Ghost not many days hence and the Holy Spirit shall overshadow you and you shall conceive Immaculate Conception bringing forth now not to different seeds only an elect seed amen God taking the air of Genesis 1 and bringing it down and remedying it in a new testament the two Vines he said watch the two Vines from Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau all the way down he said you can watch The Trail Of The Serpent and the trail of the word of God amen amen it was beyond any five physical senses it wasn't by feeling no she didn't feel it she believed it now the mystery continues so Revelations God sharing you with his thoughts so we see in the Old Testament what God did that's a type and a shadow are we are we together on that so so then we can tell what God did he's doing it again what he did in Genesis he's doing now in the New Testament now any of you ever gone hunting with a a blood hound any of you ever haunted something with a blood hound and get out there well we've done it before and when you do a blood hound which is a good blood hound he goes by sin he does not go by Society doesn't go by hearing in fact when you're out there and you cut a track and all of a sudden and the dogs and and when the owner gets out the dog they're excited all they want to do let me go let me run well you've always got an experienced dog and other inexperienced ones that are just along for the run so all of a sudden you let out all the dogs and that experienced one takes the lead and then all of a sudden the younger dogs usually start out running and they're not following anything but just I'm in church this is fun let's run run and so they're all running and everything but here is that experience [Music] St I got the trail I lost it for a minute I I'm back on it and her little tail and her whack going going now that blood hound is trained to not go by the eyesight or no you know it doesn't see the animal and all of a sudden that animal runs up a tree and the scent no longer on the ground I've lost of scent where is it I better go back and they start circling around all of a sudden they start looking up a tree then all the others they get the same Revelation and they're all they're all barking treed well guess what that that animal did if it's smart animal goes up a tree gets on a branch and goes to another tree gets on another branch and while they're all going and a hunter comes up here you lion dog you're barking up the wrong tree there ain't no up here he's SM smarter than you but old Betsy huh yeah she she I'm not he's up here yeah but I'm going keep an eye on him I'm circling ah I see movement like this and while these other inexperienced they're all barking like this he's over and and going from tree to tree a man's like a tree and he goes from this tree from this man from this man he goes over and drops down and guess what Oh Betsy gets back on it again then the others get excited and they take off again then then it it guess what it goes through the water goes through all kinds of water baptism and Bs Betsy there's no scent on the water but if I just keep going around here it's not father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ here it is then that thing goes up on the rocks hard to follow the scent on the Rocks okay you got to have ground wet moisture so I was they're going huh from rock to rock from church to church right I know and old Betsy she's just going around and she catches why watch this it it may be seven days seven Church ages it might be that old Betsy misses the trail for a little bit but once she picks up the scent she starts balling again and I want you to understand we have followed the trail of the blood yes amen from One messenger to another amen here it was Paul Paul the first hey follow Paul as I follow yeah and all of a sudden Paul goes off the scene Oh Betsy where is where is he I know I just make a couple circles it's just a few years there's something and here irenius I got it again here it is all of a sudden it's just a few years irenius goes off the scene B I know I know he's around here somewhere here comes Martin Here Comes Columbo here comes the 7th Church age messenger oh I found him good am do you understand that's right there are people in every age that are ordained to follow the blood path thank you Lord do you understand they will catch it by just making a natural analogy sorry all right caral mind won't understand it intellectual mind won't catch it watch this but the seed of God is predestinated to catch it amen you don't go to Seminary to get it it's not somebody teaching you in do it it's not knowing the Greek and the Hebrew though that's good and though you compare the Bible verse by verse verse even in the early church age they divided the church over an accent a dipthong of how you enunciate a word and it split the church how many people split over little insignificant differences White Horse White Cloud ream said what difference does it make as long as we agree he's coming amen we argue and fuss over the least little thing and want well if you don't see it my way then you're out so now watch this God used Luther I'm going to give you types and shadows God used Luther he gave him a message and Luther's word became the message for that hour can we agree on that we can look and see that it had such an effect and he only had one verse in the Bible anointed to him one verse can you imagine he looks and says then the just shall live by faith and he starts a Reformation he starts a protest and they become Protestants wow but then Luther goes off the scene God moves on Along Comes Wesley picks up the tril again God uses them and now Wesley starts a move of God that we've got to put our faith into action so we have a method a method on how we serve God so we became the Methodist and it dies and God moves on so God used Pentecost follow now the types the Shadows messenger message Anointed The Christ of God it dies God moves on then comes Pentecost guess what they denominate God moves on so God brings William brandham let me say something and blow your mind here for just a moment and when he dies God moves up on Amen now the tapes are stored up food that's right am but if you catch this the ministry changes there's a new Administration when Jesus Christ died the ministry didn't change God just changes his math amen he goes to another body which is his same body because the Holy Spirit only goes into his own body demons go into any kind of body pigs horses dogs bats but the Holy Spirit can only enter into his body so now brother Brenham comes with a message that's what makes us different because now we have something come out of her my people come out of what Jezebel religion amen come out of three Gods he's not three Gods he's one God his name is not father son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus Christ and Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new oh wow and there before our wondering eyes okay he he takes us away from Pagan idolatry of Christmas and of Easter and the commercialism and he brings us into truth and he said be careful you don't go right back into Catholicism again that's the mother Harlot and when she has children they're the same as the mother she's the mother and her daughters are harlots I want to ask you what part of Catholic Doctrine would you accept huh what part of it can I feed you and say it's okay how about if I take Easter and say hey I think we ought to celebrate Easter I'll have Robert get in a big old bunny suit big old ears and he'll come out here I have him hop around on the grass out here and he'll give give our kids a few eggs find somebody else find somebody else how about Jonathan he's almost as still he won't do it either good grieve somebody here what I'm saying is what part of it would you accept you say no hey hey hey I came out of that right my wife was raised in the most Catholic Family I have ever met nobody stricter in the Catholic Church than her family her her father went to bed before bed he said the hail Mar's and the rosary or whatever they do be and let me tell you he hated me because his daughter left the Catholic church now God was dealing with her before she even met me and she began to see herself something was wrong but after we got married even at our wedding her parents didn't come my parents didn't come why because we're both crazy that's okay we still got married I still fell in love I loved her and they didn't come my my brother he got a big wedding my parents helped find my sister big wedding Sandy and I never a dime how much money did we have on our wedding Sandy how much 50 bucks 50 bucks she made her own dress picked her own flowers at the apartment complex huh I wore a suit that I had for my junior year to escort the um what do they call it uh at high school where they got the homecoming yeah yeah so one of the princesses or whatever and you ride in the car and you sit there and everything I had this this green checkered jacket and I had a green checkered vest and green pants and everything they call me the leprechaun so I got married in that I didn't have anything else didn't have a suit got married in it her parents weren't there my parents weren't there we had nobody to give her away the brother who helped bring me to the message brought her down she walked down the aisle to Amazing Grace Jack Vance any of you remember Jack Vance one of the associate ministers in Flagstaff sister Shirley went ahead and made the cake for us they had the reception at brother Floyd's house my but we were married and that 50 bucks none of it was mine now I have to admit something here to you young men because when you tell me you're interested in getting married I have several points I want to ask you you got money do you have a car I didn't have a car do you have a place to take her I didn't have a place to take her all of the things that I asked you I didn't have all I had was love had to borrow my brother's van to go to the Grand Canyon Mike Patterson got us our first two nights at elar lodge wow that was fantastic God changes his m so in this day God has sent an angel I want you hey hey guys this is not mysticism this is nothing far out God has Vindicated a messenger accompanied by an angel of God and brought to us a message thank you Lord the message is not to stay in books and tapes that message unfold to the messenger he doesn't understand his strange birth he doesn't understand voices and Visions he's he's a young man he sees whirlwinds and trees he hears voices an amber light comes over his bed when he was born the family are not religious he doesn't understand he's he's wondering what what has do all this stuff gets on a bus with a couple of his friends and a lady uh behind him is is one of these Wizards or something she says hey son do you know there's a light following you do you know I can tell you what day you were born she start you know a little like one of these card readers or whatever oh don't tell me and he he just runs away then he becomes a missionary baptist okay I guess I'm supposed to be religious he goes and his own Pastor tells him this stuff's of the devil oh I don't want to be the devil his heart is so sincere H these men are they're Elders they're great men I I don't want to be a devil musicians if you come I don't want to be a devil he goes and and he's praying God I want this gift to leave me I take this away from me it's demons I I want demons I don't want demons I Want You Lord he said there I am he says I'm kneeling down in a little a little wooden Hut he said I hear footprints come across the floor he said I look up and there he is an angel of God he said I stood there looking at him I was scared to death he says this the first time that I've ever seen him in physical form and he says fear not he said there's that voice I've heard as a little boy Bo first time I see him in physical form fear not for I've been sent from the presence of almighty God to come and tell you that this gift that is in your life is for a purpose for the time will come when you will pray for kings and monarchs I'm going to give you two signs as Moses was given two signs you'll be given two signs he said if you'll get the people to believe nothing will stand in your way not even [Music] cancer now though that sign was a sign to get the attention didn't make you a Believer amen signs are not for believers they're for unbelievers because in a wicked and adulterous seeketh after [Music] signs he said if you just get the people to believe brother minow you were in his meeting you got to see him you got to see a prophet in action several of others here brother Paul love brother Mike the day they preached choosing a bride he was [Music] there others [Music] here so God uses this ministry he has a first and second pull when it comes to this third poll it's so holy it's so reverent sh [Music] because what you did don't get your line all tangled up in times like these don't tell them how to fish leave it alone brother Ram said it's that third pull I've got to be very Sovereign to I can't say much about it that's why there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour he said if you were spiritual you should have caught that the other day this is that third he said what is it he said God changing the [Music] ministry God in [Music] morpha because you know what after the sounding of Revelations 10:7 there's another voice that comes on the scene [Music] Revelations 10:8 now takes it eat the book I'm going to say to all of you if you are not eating of the revealed word of the hour you're just religious you'll follow the Creeds and the dogmas and the teaching you'll go to church you'll have a long hair long dress that don't make you holy that doesn't mean you're going no you better having a relationship with Jesus Christ [Music] amen you get into these tapes and books because what I'm preaching to you it was not taught to me by by man neither was given to be by man but I certify to you Brethren that that which I am preaching unto you God gave it to me himself I didn't confer with [Music] man this message how dare we make it a Creed and a Dogma how dare we just make it Church order we know how to go to church we know okay half hour we'll go ahead and sing we'll have the song leader get up he'll say a few songs and and echam speo 22 ding ding ding ding ding we'll go ahead and light a candle [Music] aen I don't want religion when Christ went off the scene the ministry [Music] changed [Music] where are you going to go Lord where I go you not know but if I don't go I can't come back to you but not many days hence the Holy Spirit still out overshadow you watch same thing he did with Mary he's doing now with the bride amen she's being quickened by the Holy Spirit I want to ask you what's the difference between bride and foolish virgin the wise and the foolish Holy Spirit I tell you what we need more today now within this message is Holy Spirit Revelation otherwise father we've made another Lodge on right and we just follow along we just trudge right along every day every church this and that you pay your ties and everything and you become religious and instead of lighting a candle you know what we do today we'll just press play I don't even have to seek the mind of God I just press play and I'll sit there and fall asleep while it's gone and when it's done okay that's it and and I don't need to go to church and you see because religious that's [Music] Catholic denominations are religious gatherings they fail to recognize their dea's message because the Bible says in Matthew 16 it says and the Pharisees tempting him they wanted to see a sign he said oh you Hypocrites you can see the red in the morning in the evening you can tell what's going to happen you could you can say it's lowering there's going to be uh a storm he said you fail to recognize the signs of the times do you recognize I ask every one of you whether you are here as a visitor or not you recognize the signs do you see what's going on nations are breaking Israel is Awakening America's ready to fall [Music] apart what is tomorrow going to bring I'll tell you what it'll bring it's going to bring chaos and destruction and your Dollar's going to fall apart and your government's going to fall apart and socialism and these left wi how did they how did this happen how did these left Wingers that are their out of their minds and now we think well the conser come on you conservative stand up come on you Mega Believers let's get trump it ain't GNA be Trump either you ain't never GNA make America great again she's done she's over she's washed up she's too far gone and I'll tell you what this President that's in there he's going to bankrupt her before he gets out going to give billions of dollars to student loan students you owe your money period you signed the contract well I don't want to have to pay it yeah so you owe it you bought your house you owe the payments you bought your car you owe the payments but we're now we're in a what a a welfare system huh I want it for free give it to me I don't want to have to work for it just give it to me you give something to free to a kid and didn't make him work for it he won't appreciate it you give him a brand new bicycle he never had to work for it you don't show him the value of money he'll come right at home he'll throw it down down on the lawn or the driveway you don't care if cars run over or not leave it out in the rain he won't but if you make him work for it huh sh him the value of money any of you parents teaching your children the value of money well we had it rough in our day I want to give my kids everything I don't want them to have to work for it yeah you make them a bunch of sissies and a bunch of welfare they get all mad at you when you make them work for something amen amen I'm sorry hey I'm going to end with this this is a very good quote this is my quote religious teachings of God's word which are just intellectual understanding void of Revelation produces religious people you got that this message void of Revelation produces religious people it was the religious people that crucified Christ it's religious people that'll hate you within the message cuz you disagree with [Music] him listen if the Capstone is supposed to come down the last step between the other steps of the pyramid coming up what's the last portion we're supposed to have brotherly kindness and love where do you where do you see that and wait preachers preaching oh God is love God is kindness disagree with him ah you're out of here you don't see it my way hit the highway huh amen meaner than a junkyard dog where what about the law how about can we disagree with one another is it okay huh siblings especially have a hard time with that you got kids just put them together in the back of the car you'll find exit get mom he's too close to me Mom tell him scoot over Mom he took my toy mom then the mother takes off her shoe the kids are what happened in our family so when you come to church you want to hear something that's going to bring you into a Perfection because that's the direction I'm I'm going to take this and I'll give you a preview right now of also what I'm going to preach with the revealing of the son of man comes another revealing cuz you can't have the revealing of the truth without the revealing of eror so when the revealing of the son of man comes guess what you got the son of predition he was born son of predition Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and neither of them having done any Works before they were born Jacob have I loved Esau how can God hate Esau he's nonseed amen now I know that blows a lot of people because people think that God can't hate something he does and God only chastises his own children he said a bastard born son is without correction he don't waste his time are we together on that okay I'm sorry I man I I got 17 pages of notes I'm on page seven that's okay is that okay with you amen amen God bless you stand together hallelujah what time is it wow 1218 I love him Saints amen I love him with a ferency and I'm jealous over this gospel with a Godly jealousy I don't like anybody playing with it don't you mess with it Paul said I'm a wise master builder let every man take heed how he builds on he said wood haaste stubble and fire will re reveal if there's anything left he said there'll come false prophets false teachers after me seducing the church wolves and sheep's clothing he said you better know the difference and the only way you're going to know the difference is you better be be a student of the word of God otherwise it'll be so close that it'll deceive if it were possible but it's not possible why God said I'll shorten the days amen thank you Lord ah these different ones that get up and say oh the devil's a bluff he can't hurt you he can't do nothing to you let me tell you he's not a bluff he's real and you play around on his Turf you're going to get burned true you get out from the protection of the word let me tell you young people you can get in here and say Boo devil he ain't going to move when you're on his territory come on help me out here amen remember that old song oh take me in oh tender woman take me in you knew he was a devil just let him in the tent well how'd the camel get in the tent one foot at a time you play around with these Spirits seducing Spirits doctrines of devils fornicating Spirits unclean lascivious a religious spirit is a sexual [Music] Spirit you want that again a religious spirit is a sexual Spirit lascivious unclean fornicating adulterous lentu huh Jezebel Harlot what is it brother Rena I'm going to end with this quote how does a church commit spiritual adultery on Christ the [Music] word how does it commit spiritual adultery on Christ's word word when you knowing better by the Intercourse of the Mind add to or take away put your own interpretation to it he said you are absolutely committing adultery on Christ the word he said don't add to it don't take from it just say what it says amen amen amen amen see why all these unclear and Spirits why some of you people you got a problem with pornography you got a problem with uncleanness you know why cuz you've been playing around with unclean spirits looking at the wrong thing putting your mind because the Bible says whatsoever you yield yourself to you become the servant thereof either to righteousness or unrighteousness be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever you sow that shall you reap that's right amen amen that's not popular but that's the truth that's right how many of you say brother Ron that's a pretty serious thing help me to be true amen help me to not put my fingers my eyes not to give of my body or to do things and go into areas that I should not and then you wonder why you can't read your Bible why you can't get uh alone with God why you just have a hard time which dog are you feeding the white dog or the black dog amen God bless you thank you thank you saints of God for coming to church thank you for having confidence in me in fact I had uh William Silva are you here William where are you back left hey back left he called me the other day he said brother Ron he wanted to go with another brother overseas and I said I told the brother inviting him said n n no hey no you want to go that that's fine but these young men I don't I don't want to put him In Harm's Way I I don't think it's good he called me up called me up yesterday he said brother Ron I just want you to know you you you forbid me to to go overseas and well I just wanted to tell you something and I thought okay here it comes I'm going to go anyway how dare you over you know what he said God bless you Pastor if you don't think ought to go I to go amen I I said say that again uh my my phone cut out say it again he said brother Ron he said if you're an ordained Pastor that's right you are ordained to Watch Over Me amen amen and so I am so glad brother William that you had you had a sensitive spirit that even if you wanted to go something inside of me said no I don't think it's
