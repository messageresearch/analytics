out of season amen welcome you all to the house of the lord this morning i'd like to sing that song open the eyes of my heart lord i just wonder heavenly father how many have never had their eyes open how many that have been raised up within this message they know you're they know your teachings they know church order their conduct is right but father are they void of understanding i'm asking god this morning open the eyes of my heart let's sing it together here for just a moment amen amen [Music] the eyes of my heart i want to see you [Music] [Music] [Music] to see shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy [Music] i wanna see you [Music] heavenly father lord as we are here and gathered together in one place i pray o god let the holy spirit have a harmony that each one would sit here in one accord father we look to you the author and the finisher of our faith we bring our petitions our requests before you i would ask heavenly father that thou would anoint this word let the eyes of our understanding go beyond the human and carnal intellect that might be able to read the words but father as you moved upon men of old and the holy spirit inspired them to pen these words i pray let that same holy spirit now descend upon each one may it feel this house as it did on the day of pentecost and licks of fire fall upon each one and we thank you and we praise you we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen amen amen god bless you thank you musicians amen praise the lord i had a prayer request come in while you all were singing sister franci nordine um sent in a urgent prayer request the doctors are giving her six months to a year to live and uh she's in severe pain she said the pain is intolerable she's going in for some more tests and everything what if what if you were facing that i wonder how sincere your prayer would be when we say let us pray for others should really take it to heart she says brother ron i i am believing what god said through you to me as you prayed over me and we're just believing that god listen even as jonah in the belly of the whale he said if i look at all of this he said these are lying vanities and he says and if i look to them then i forsake my own mercy oh god i pray let's pray right now for sister francie amen heavenly father now in the name of jesus christ even as she is streaming this service right now father i pray send the angels of mercy o god what is cancer it is father something that it just takes a moving of your hand god i pray that you will bless her lord subside the pain away from her and father i pray let there be a miracle father let her stand once again here to testify of your healing mercy and we will be certain to give you praise and honor and glory forever and ever and the church of the living god said amen amen god bless you amen psalms 119 and ephesians 1. i love god with a fervency i'm passionate about what i believe i'm a zealot for this message and in a way that i serve god some men call heresy but i love him and i love his word his word is an absolute it is the plum bob it is the measuring line it is the absolute by which all things are measured not by emotion not by sensation not even by signs and wonders because the bible says there will be many that come unto me in that day and they will say lord did not we do this and do that in your name cast out devils heal the sick and so on and so on and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you what a horrible thing that would be to think that what you had done he would not recognize i think as a pastor of a church in the message i have it upon my heart always the young people and the different ones i always say father is there someone here in our midst that's maybe never seen the light of this gospel in the way that we see it i don't want to pass one of them i don't want to take it for granted i don't want to look just on the outside because that's pharisitical religion they wash the outside of the cup at the inside psalms 119 verses 17 excuse me we'll just yeah 17-18 deal bountifully with thy servants that i may live and keep thy word open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law would you like that this morning let me see wondrous things marvelous things heavenly things turn with me the book of ephesians chapter 1. hallelujah ephesians 1 verses 17 and 18 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him as a pastor that is my prayer for every one of you that the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints may god add the blessing of the reading of his words you all may be seated this morning in the presence of almighty god what a privilege it is to be a christian to call him our father amen i'm thankful that god doesn't look upon us on the outward but on the inward he looks to where that elect seed is at always when i get touched and i get sensitive my nose tends to run a little bit so if i if i wipe my nose i'm sure you guys will understand i um you know i one time i think i've told you this before i i was kind of upset at the lord that i always cry and weep and get kind of touched and sensitive and some of you sit there this is dry-faced and unemotional and i'm thinking oh my here i am everybody's looking at me and i said lord why'd you make me that way and you know i i and maybe i was a little ashamed of myself if you would well i'll tell you what for the next six months leroy went through the driest spell in his life and i said oh god let me be sensitive i don't care if i cry every service i don't care if i sh if i shout and get excited and make a fool of myself because i'm a fool for christ but whose fool are you you all got to serve somebody i'm glad i served jesus christ hallelujah my friend and my counselor my guide my mediator my hope my trust my all in all i'd like to title my sermon this morning open thou mine eyes i like to take for a subject the eyes of your understanding being enlightened then they knew him so what it takes it takes your lot your eyes of your understanding to be opened and then you'll know him father i pray that everyone here this morning has an eye-opening experience and part not of what the world calls a woke generation but a real woke person that is awoke to the shout of this end time to prepare to get ready because he's coming soon amen one of my most favorite scriptures when i think of eyes becoming open as found in luke chapter 24 and we will be turning to that for a moment but i wish to rehearse some things in your mind this is three days after the crucifixion the disciples their lives have been shattered they're afraid they're fearful of their own lives they've gone into hiding they watched the one that they hoped would set up the kingdom they watched him be crucified and die some of them were the ones that took him down off the cross laid him in a tomb had to hurry up and do it because it was a sabbath and they didn't want to defile the sabbath so they very quickly put some spices and put some grave clothes around him and they scurried off and i'm sure that their hearts were absolutely smitten if any of you have ever lost a loved one and you know that that parting is there's a tearing they're gone never to talk to them again never to speak to them never to hold their hand never to look them in the eye again never to walk down the road with them once again we've all experienced it it's such a tearing death is but here there is two that is on the road to emmaus the bible doesn't even record the name of one of them it only says there's one by the name of cleopas the other one he's just called the other disciple and here they are now they're on a journey imagine they're kind of walking slowly don't have really no zip in their step no fire in the furnace what are we gonna do probably at a slow pace once in a while maybe stopping and looking at one another did it really happen how many of you that have ever been through such a traumatic event after the event or even while you're in the midst of it is this really real so turn with me if you would to luke 24 and i wish to just kind of preach and teach as we go along verse by verse luke 24 verse 15. and it came to pass while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them now here's the resurrected lord jesus and i've told you this multitudes of times this is not alzheimer's or amnesia but every time that christ shows himself after the resurrection never did they recognize him with human eyes and here are two disciples that know what he looks like they've been there they've been with him they know how his voice is they know his stature and jesus drew near he's doing the same thing this morning but their eyes were holding they should not know him father i wonder how many are sitting here right now that are in the same situation that they can't really see him they're so caught up in carnal things and life and life has just cares about it if you're not careful it'll choke the seed and it becomes lifeless don't ever let the cares of life do that to you the bible says in her eyes we're holding they didn't know it was him i wonder how many times a song is sung and something about that song you were blessed there was an anointing i wonder if he's passing by and you missed it and he said unto them in verse 17 what manner of communication are these that you have one to another and as you walk and you're so sad what does this communication tell me and one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem haven't you been around don't you know what's been happening why there's been all kinds of events and hosanna to the highest and good friday and on and on and oh my there's been a trial and a crucifixion where have you been man are you a stranger that's that well not known which these things which are come to pass or they're in these days he said to them what things he want to hear from them what things what tell me come on fill me in i haven't been here i've been locked away i've been doing something in secret i've been busy so fill me in what kind of things they said to me and concerning jesus of nazareth which was a mighty prophet indeed in word before god and all the people and i'm sure he probably said oh yeah really maybe testing them a little bit sometimes i think god tests you oh you you sing that song these are the days of elijah oh really god tell you if you really really had the true revelation let's see these are you know what i've seen elijah i've heard him preach these are the days of elijah how many of the millions of people in regular christendom sing that song and we're the only ones that seeing it come to pass we've seen the elijah and how the chief priests and their rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and they crucified him but we trusted then it had been he we should redeem all israel besides all this today's the third day since these things were done yay and guess what certain women also of our company of our group of our message followers you know what they did they made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher so now they're playing the scenario some of the message believers went there and they went to the sepulcher and when they found nana's body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive now i want all of you to understand that when the supernatural takes place among us many times we miss it because we're too carnal the bible says be careful because sometimes you will entertain angels and you won't even be aware of it verse 24 and a certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ who have suffered these sayings and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scripture concerning the things concerning himself wow wouldn't you like to been there and moses said there'll be a prophet likened unto me you see and and just go on he took the prophets jeremiah isaiah ezekiel he began to take all of the different prophets and he began and you know what he was doing he was identifying his ministry in scripture and wow you talk about a sermon and no doubt that probably as they're walking along and then christ makes a makes a real point and and jeremiah said and they stop and they look at him and this one that their eyes are still not recognizing that it's him look at him intently and are trying to figure out i thought this guy is a stranger listen to what he said my i'll tell you what that message is just burning inside of me does not it stir your heart that's what the word of god will do to everyone who is an elect seed it'll stir you amen and when they drew nyan to the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further he wanted to be asked to stay i'm going to give you a clue about god god wants you to ask him to stay how many times does he come and he draws nigh and you know what he just says well i've got to be going now you ever had him bless you while you're reading the scripture and then all of a sudden says but i've got to go now you ever been singing a song and you're mildly blessed and he says excuse me time's up i i i really need to be going i wonder how many of you have ever persevered long enough and compelled him and said lord stay here with me that's all he asks you to do is lord stay here with me the day is far spin this is evening time this is louder you see it god whatever you do don't leave me so quickly i need you is this darkness in this age that we're living in i need you i compel you lord would you the days were spent stay with us the bible says and they constrained him you look sometimes you can tell if people are real serious or not on their reaction on what you're gonna do well i think i'll go okay thank you for stopping by i'm sure you know whenever you're in the area stop in are kind of like paying the the bill when you grab the check and they say oh no let me have it but they don't reach for it you know the difference between the guy who says no i want it because i've had a tug of war i am a giver and when i see different ones hey that you know oh well hey let me pay the bill you can kind of slide it toward them and they're they're going oh you know the weather sure is nice today kind of change the subject by the way jean tambour do you like my shoes yeah he got him for me amazing all of a sudden i get some shoes show up wow amazing thank you god bless you richly but they constrained him saying abide with us for it's toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to terry with him and it came to pass as he sat at meat he took bread now it has to be more than just a regular bread because this is just a symbol jesus says i am the bread which came down from heaven your fathers did eat manna from the wilderness and everyone did but he that will eat of this bread and they constrain him and he took the bread and when he blew when he break it guess what their eyes came open oh god i pray may there be lots of breaking of bread here in this church and through every bible and in every one of your prayer closets and all the time that you seek god and ask god for revelation may he break your bread [Music] and your eyes come open and they knew him my god my it's him and they knew him and like god who loves to come make himself known to you and become so dynamic how many of you have been in a service been reading your bible been listening to a tape and singing a song been doing something and all of a sudden his presence comes by and it's so overwhelming and and you just have a moment with god and for moments maybe your heavenly places in christ jesus and suddenly he pulls back into the invisible realm because he makes himself known then he vanishes god does that many times in your life he doesn't come let me give you an example when we come to church and there are certain times when you either preach a sermon you sing a song or do something in my the presence of god comes down and you could sing that song or preach that same sermon again and guess what it's dry he vanishes and he goes back into that unseen realm because we do not walk by sight but by faith and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures god open our eyes of understanding to your scriptures is it possible that eyes could actually beholden and he could be here with us he could be doing things here among us and our eyes are missing it because we're looking at the wrong thing amen second corinthians 4 verses 3 and 4. but if our gospel is hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not who blinded their minds the god of this world who cares what they think that's why i don't care what the movie stars and the rock and roll singers and the wealthy of this world have got to say who asked you in whom the god of this world had blinded their minds the revelation of the gospel of jesus christ is the means by which one soul is delivered from the powers of darkness oh satan has powers the bible says that satan has power but god is an almighty power light is far greater than darkness a darkened mind is one that the power of satan has come and brought to him an altered state of his mind and he sees things differently and boy if we don't see that around in the world today and the way they're acting you want to say is any of them normal no they're not why because the god of this world has blinded their minds you can ask a supreme court nominee what is a woman i don't think i can answer you i'm not a biologist oh you see how far science and education will take you why a third grader an unenlightened mind is a mind that is carnal and cannot understand the things of god they have eyes to see but they see not they have ears to hear but they hear not jesus always spake in parables to the people is that right do you know that this message is a parable to unbelievers hey we have a language that we talk all that hey a normal guy out there he got no idea you talk about predestination talk about elect seed talk about rapture you know we i was speaking something about that the other day and newcomer that was here is saying hey rapture's not even in the bible we know that it's a label that they've put to the catching away oh yeah catching a ways in the bible and just as i've preached that sermon being caught up how many of you really realize that what god has done by sharing with you the revelation of this message he's actually caught you up and i'll be so bold to tell you this that if you are not caught up in this message right now you'll not be caught up when he catches them up oh you might be busy doing your career or studying or making money and he'll leave you right here i thank god that i've been caught up with this thing since i was 18 years old praise god i'm not ashamed of it and i've been preaching the same thing i'm preaching since i was 18 and i'll soon be 70. so don't say well you're just an old man yeah well i am an old man but i was saying the same thing when i was young yeah i've been pondering over this idea about opening eyes and about this woke generation that we he we see around us isn't it amazing that god will say that there are some people that have eyes but they don't see there'll be some that have ears and they don't hear so i want to take a closer look at that brother bram says in the door inside a door you might say to me i got good eyesight mr branham well i'm thankful for that but you might ever see such a good physical sight and be spiritually blind let god open your spiritual sight after all you don't see with your eyes did you know that no you look with your eyes you see with your heart saint john 3 says except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god and he cannot understand the kingdom of god until you're born again you see seeing something with the physical eye is not believing why'd they tell us everywhere seeing's not believing in fact some of you have seen some supernatural events in your life perhaps you've seen an angel or you've seen a ghost or you've seen a ufo or you've seen something unexplainable and after you get done you go did i really see that in fact brother brennam said he said you will be judged you know on the picture of the pillar of fire above his head he said for those that were there that had even seen it he said you know they could have it could have been there for just a moment and gone and wow was that just the light on the wall what was that i did i really see that but he said the picture that captured it do you know that there was a woman i believe it was a woman that looked at that picture and snickered brother bram said she blasphemed the holy ghost because god allowed his picture to be taken and says will hold you accountable on what you think about it that man that went to brother branham you remember said smiley blinds mind me blind now if it would have been me i'd have probably asked god to do it but brother brenham such a seasoned minister of christ here in the unwelcome christ he said i said brother you're just born blind that's all you were born blind and i doubt whether you'll ever receive your sight or not i said i'd rather be physical blind than to be spiritually blind like that well i said you'd be far better off if you were everyone totally blind had to be let around by your your arms so you don't have no eyes let somebody your eyes lead you you'd be far better off but i said because the things that the prophets has longed to see and you see these things that great men long to see and still you won't believe it i said well did isaiah speak of you right seeing you have eyes and can't see in ears and you can't hear we know that the faith is the sixth sense faith is the sense that god uses for each one of you of all the five physical senses faith is far above that faith doesn't reason faith believes faith obeys and there are many times in your life that god will require you to walk out by faith and you don't see a result before you move god is waiting for you to act first then the ram will appear some of you have been so pacified so much babied you're afraid of faith you're afraid to change a job or go somewhere else or to do something in the name of the lord because oh uh well i i better sell my house first no if god tells you to move move god will sell your house too much of the time we got it backwards don't we abraham who is the father of our faith god told him to go where just go i'll show you where to go it's like telling your family get in the car and get the kids and they're all sitting there but where are we going where are we going where are we just i'll tell you when we get there and every five minutes are we there yet saints of god let me tell you this race is just about over we're just about there how much longer hang on i don't know but i i say this if he doesn't come next week then i'll be serving him the week after if he doesn't come that week see it we're going to be serving him just like abraham i've got some things in my heart that'll be sharing with you in the next little bit but abraham you see what happened abraham's wife sarah began to get nervous it ain't happening uh you see it wouldn't have been such a great miracle for them to have kids when they're young still having husband and wife relation yeah hey but then pretty soon it gets where he's old she's old he's as good as dead she's as good as dead and so god says well what do you think abraham i told you you're going to have a son praise god i love how brother brenham reenacts it so much of the time he comes in there as an old man hey sarah how you feeling hon nothing praise god we're going to have it anyway you see god don't need your help amen god sometimes lets you get into a situation where you have exhausted all of your resources you have done everything to deliver yourself and when you finally said i've done everything i've spent all my living and i've none the better he said are you done are you done yeah yes let go and let god amen you know what saints of god i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lean on him not on my own understanding because my own understanding drives me crazy wacko but if i learn to lean on him i'm learning somebody say i'm learning yeah i don't act like you're all there and you you got it all and you you know exactly no there's a lot of times you're going through things and you're still learning second corinthians 5 7 says for we walk by faith not by sight amen we walk walking is fellowship does the bible talk about a man who walked with god brother brenham said that enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him now catch this because brother branham said enoch walk by faith so imagine he's walking one day and brother branham says he's getting so close to god because he's walking by revelation and he's probably thinking on heavenly things he's probably having god so absorb him and catching him up into heavenly places oh lord i just can't wait to just go and to be with you and all of a sudden his foot don't come down brother rem said he stepped into his revelation brother brenham said to the bride of christ she is waiting for what the revelation of the rapture because it's a revelation you say well uh how's it going hey listen i'm not here to try to work it out in all the details and i really don't care all i know is i'm a part of what he's doing now therefore i'll be a part of what he'll do then all i gotta do is just keep walking quit you know how many people quit how many people take a uh uh they hit the ditch here or there they quit going to church they quit fellowship why they quit walking keep walking amen hebrews 11 verses 1 through 3 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for in the evidence of things not seen for by it what faith the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were made of things which do up here wow i'll tell you the more that you try to figure this all out and how old the earth is and god said that in so many days he made the earth and this and that and what about the the the dinosaurs and uh i tell you what it's amazing i worked on an archaeological dig in northern california for dr louis leakey any of you ever heard of dr louis leakey some of the old people one of the most famous archaeologists in the world dr louis leakey we're on an alluvial fan in calico california and i am the site photographer for an archaeological dig they've got the squares and you've seen it on uh national geographic and they sit there and they dig and they have brushes and they get so and every rock every little stone they do well whenever there's something that maybe looks a little bit unusual they have the site photographer come over there and before you move the object you take pictures of it that's what i did so all day i'm running back and forth and everything well they found a uh a round circle of stones and they took a stone out of this circular uh set of stones they took a stone out of there and they cut it up and they could tell that the inside part of the stone had received heat while the outside of the stone had not so they said it's a fireplace it's the first known fireplace of ancient man on north american continent and everything and so then they they date this and i'm thinking oh wow this is amazing imagine these people sitting around the campfire look like a bunch of monkeys sitting there right because crow magnet man didn't any of you go to school what's amazing to them is to them they sit there and they preach it this is true this is this is it but you know what to them it is truth they came from a beast they're going back to a beast it's not true for us why because i come from god i'm going back to god you say well seeing is believing are you sure matthew 13. let me go to a couple scriptures here and try to come to a point here in just a moment matthew 13 verses 13 through 17 therefore i speak to them in parable because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have clothes less at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which he hear and have not heard them and revelation is actually the opening of your understanding to the scripture revelation is always associated with an illuminated mind unbelief is always associated with darkness and confusion any man can open the bible if he knows how to read and he can read the same words that we do and receive nothing i'll tell you how powerful the word is do any of you ever underline and highlight parts of your bible wow why did i never see that before man i get out the yellow i put an asterisk like that sometimes i write in there amen hallelujah i get excited just writing all over my bible i come back even a week later thinking i have exhausted everything from that scripture i read it again and it's it's totally new how did i miss that how many of you have listened to a tape of the prophet before and you've heard it and you've heard it and you thought you cleaned everything out of it and go back to a little bit later it's a whole new tape and i'll tell you what a lot of this has to do with your spiritual maturing when you're a little child you thought as a child understood as a child but as you grow in christ i trust that every one of you are seeking god did god give you revelation because you can half of the tapes and books and still miss it you can go to church and hear the sermons and still miss it i want to be so very earnest with all of you i wonder how many of you have ever really gotten so serious with god that you say god show me who you are let me see for myself if you'll do that he'll show you that's why i i ask any of you that have never really maybe you've been just caught up in the vortex of this message and you've just been going along with it maybe you were born in it some of the young people born in this message are the hardest to get converted you know why they become complacent oh well i wear a i wear a dress i don't cut my hair uh you know i go to church so by your conduct okay well i guess and if we're not careful what happens is we look at the outside and we said well i guess they're okay i guess they're okay and they go on for years until they come to a time when it's their decision maybe they move out of the house maybe for the 18 or 20 years because i i know that when my kids were growing up in my home i said i am a christian this is a christian home i place a token over this house and i don't care how much you want a tv you ain't getting one i'm the papa bear in this fairy tale and if you don't have the conviction enough i do now there are many believers today and i don't know about your home maybe you're one of them that says well my kids can do what they want to do and if they want a television in their their room why i tell you what then i'll just have to respect that i want to ask you where are you daddy i thought you said you applied to token to the home well i'll tell you what you know if she wants to wear some skin down wiener dress and and she wants to act like that and if johnny wants to go ahead and put on his shorts and and go out there and be with the rest of the boys where is the conviction yeah it's true my kids did not have a lot of choices you can go to church you go to the youth meeting you can go to church you can go to come on we it's more than that but that's that's really about all they see and so i had restrictions because i have enough conviction of god that i said okay now listen because this is my house i'm the high priest of this home you may not agree with this and you may not like it and when you get old enough you can you can move out and then you can be big bad bill you can go ahead and live any way you want to but while you're in my house joshua said as far as me and my house we'll serve the lord otherwise what we do is we just say well we want them to get their own revelation uh-huh oh sure so you let them just go ahead and live any kind of and you know what you're doing to your house when you let that in you're defiling your house now i don't know why i'm going off on some of these things here but i just kind of feel to do it because we're seeing a morphing within the message i wonder what the next generation is going to look like if the lord tarries another 10 years what will a message believer look like will the ministry have lowered the standard so much and allowed the camel to get in the tent that pretty soon there's no more holiness do you know holiness is not a way of dressing holiness is a relationship between you and god and if we're not careful even the apostle paul said look i want to tell you corinthian group be not conformed but be transformed by the renewing of your mind if we're not careful what we've done we've conformed everybody and we've made them according to their conduct and we say they've got in yet inside they've never had that place where their eyes were opened i don't know about you but i i love god and i love this message amen how many of you love the lord amen now i've i remember and brother paul i'm going to use you an example paul was struggling here a while back paul's a a ball player played sports most of his life had the team here with the church and so on and so forth and he wasn't doing right i said paul i need you to get in the game did i tell you that paul i said i need you to get in the game i need you to get serious i i and i'm just i just provoking him onto good works and not allowing him to throw all the excuses of why he couldn't and i talked to him out here in front of the church the other day i said paul i love it i love it i said when i come to church and i said we're singing a song you stand up ain't nobody else standing up i said paul what happened what'd you tell me yeah you get the holy ghost that's all you need young people i don't want you to just go to church once you get the holy ghost and i as a pastor of this end time i'm saying god let me stir the people let me stir them and if they don't have the holy ghost and they don't know if they've got it or not i'll tell you if you don't know you got it you ain't got it because there's an assurance when you get it oh yeah you know what there's a lot of times when you don't feel like you got the holy ghost because god's weaning you away from feelings a lot of times you don't feel saved oh yeah skies brass things are going rough ain't no blessing nowhere you can't find no anointing read your bible listen to it tape i'm going crazy you know what god's just seeing what kind of reaction you got and he wants to see your reaction to his action saul saul of tarsus is probably the best example of a guy who was religious and concerning the law was blameless i was born a pharisee my father was a pharisee i've got the lineage of pharisees concerning the law of blameless i was taught by gamilio and of course and he just he just brags and brags and brags but one day one day he met god you see elect seeds can go a long time until god gets hold of him and god got a hold of him god had to blind him to open his eyes in acts 26 i'm going to just show you very quickly musicians you go ahead and come because i'm going to try to bring this to i'm only on page four and i get that's okay 12. at midday oh king he's brought before the sanhedrin council this is the highest court of the law in the land at midday o king i saw on the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the hebrew tongue saul saw why persecute us thou me is it hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord brother branham said here's a pharisee a one who's not good he's going to say who art thou elohim tell me who you are who art thou elohim he said i am jesus whom thou persecute us but arise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister now stop here for a moment because god never does anything without a purpose i've appeared to thee for a purpose every time god appears to you every time god gives you a revelation every time god does something to open your eyes it has a purpose behind it i've appeared unto thee for a purpose to make thee a minister and a witness of both of these saints which thou has seen of those things which i will appear unto thee and i'm going to deliver you from the people some of you need to be delivered from the people around you hang around the wrong crowd i'm going to deliver i've appeared to you for a purpose verse 18 says and to open their eyes turn them from the darkness to light from the power of satan to the power of god amen wow you mean to tell me that satan has a power and he can hold people and he can enslave people absolutely but i have a god who is a deliverer he's able to deliver you that's why i've appeared to you to you to be a minister i want you to go preach the gospel to these guys i want you to open their eyes now realize i as a minister i can't open your eyes but if you're there and you're sensitized to the holy spirit and i say something and it's the holy spirit using me guess what i got it i got it and appearing is actually a revealing or an unveiling whenever god appears he reveals something if god ever comes and speaks to you he's appearing to you he's bringing to you revelation and understanding and i wonder how many religious message believers today who need to get converted they've just been raised up in it they've been around it they may look good on the outside but what about the inside brother ram said like that pastor is saying hey my my wife she's a she's a saint they said he looked at her with her hair doing a manicure and all of this stuff and he said looks like to me she's a hain she ain't got it come up there and put her hand up there he says hi how do you do i'd like to you know he said well bring it down here so i can shake it i do you know what is the most appealing thing to this message to me it didn't have all the fluff and frill of pentecost and of hollywood evangelism it was real it was real and i've always said god don't give me something counterfeit give me something real like that young boy i've told you the testimony and i'm going to say this in close that young boy in germany had been raised in the message around a message family and just got to hanging around the wrong crowd smoking drinking and he was the roughest carouser in the group all the young people knew him he was the elder of the one that's having the youth meeting sometimes the roughest kids they're associated with some of the elders the pastor huh deacon yeah because the devil wants to take your kids and take them down i preached and a young boy came to the church service actually in a in a big old home a farmhouse and we we were there we preached the day before and holy spirit moved in a powerful way and i have a translator with me and it was a good service and everything but you know what this young man said he was touched in his heart and he said i need to know if this is really true and he went up into the hayloft above the barn where they'd take the hay and throw it down to the cows and you know and he walked in the hay loft all night and ben you know what he was saying i got to know is this real [Music] you know i don't want to serve something that's phony i need to know it's real i don't want to believe it because my mom and dad believe it i don't want to believe it because i'm caught up in something else i need to know for myself so i need you to give me a sign [Music] i need you to give me a sign lord he's walking up and down up there in the loft of the barn i need you to give me a sign because i want something real god gives me a vision there's been a few times in my life god's given me visions i had a vision and this this farmhouse was so packed that i'm no more than this far away from those that are sitting right in front of me and in this vision i i see all the young people i see three young girls sitting right here to my front and what's empowering and i'll tell you what brother david when you have a vision and you step into the vision it gives you power yeah you walk into it this is what i saw i told my wife i said sandy he had a vision i saw me preaching i knew what i was preaching but i don't know when it's gonna happen i can't make it happen that morning guess what we step right into the vision here i am wow here's some young girls and there was somebody a young man in the back but about where you're at justin and holy spirit told me to tell that young man i don't know him i don't know who he is i don't know where he comes from i don't know if he goes to church or what about him i said stand up and say you love the lord and these three young girls who are this close to me you know what they did they turned around look who's he talking about so they turned around to look and this young man stands up and they started laughing because this is the roughest kid in the group i'm embarrassed for you preacher stand up and say you love the lord you blew it preacher this guy you don't know him smoking drinking making fun of god all of a sudden this young man and he broke he's speaking in german he's saying yesterday during the service that i was moved but i want to know is it real and if it's real i'm going to ask you god to do something really special for me i'm going to have you ask brother ron to have me to stand up and say that i love the lord that's a supernatural god and i believe that we'll see more and more of this the only thing is we don't sit there and try to does that make me anything no just a servant just a servant and now that young man loves the lord serving the lord doing what's right i had an opportunity there in that farmhouse to witness one of the greatest opportunities i've ever seen of the falling like it was on the day of pentecost only the only thing that i did was different i told him i don't want you to play no music now you guys keep playing i want you to keep playing but i told him i said don't don't get to the music god don't need your help i said because on the day of pentecost they were just sitting and a rushing mighty wind fell upon them and cloven tongues sat upon each one of them and then guess what huh and i saw the holy spirit move in such a powerful way and the parents because i told the parents you can't take any of the chairs here in this part of the house you have to sit that would be where the fourier's at now appearance there because germans and you have to understand german ways huh al is invested in deutschland fear haben alice kind of an arrogant huh that i'm talking about not converted germans just german huh allah why do we have an american guy come over here preach to our kids can't our german men do it so there's like this until the holy spirit begins to move now you can criticize all you want but you moms and dads that you've been praying for your little sis and your little son who's having a hard time that's becoming a renegade that you're wondering what's gonna and when you see him crying and shouting and your daughter was snot coming out of her nose and she's just she's just being birthed into the kingdom would that change your attitude and then it's the parents because they couldn't see so the parents got up hold me hold me the parents got up on their chairs because they know the cry of their child and when they hear the cry of their son and their daughter thank you all of a sudden what do you think they did we're having we're just having us a pentecost see god don't need our help just let go and let god let god do this when it's the sovereign move of god you don't have to work it up no because he can be still and know i'm god there's a sovereignty about god and when he comes by and the thing that i loved about brother branham it was so real and so genuine and he was saying i don't nobody moved he's here now don't even get up don't take your child out he's sovereign he's meek he's holy oh that's so different than the modern day evangelist that we're all out there on the evangelistic trail i love this message i do and i want to i want to encourage all of you i want you to pray more seek god more i want you to ask god god give me greater revelation than i've ever had before open the eyes of my heart lord and maybe parents he's opened your your eyes but what about your children what about that little one that you got sitting on your lap right now you know they're gonna grow up they're gonna hang around all of these different ones in this woke society and it's going to happen they're going to go to school they're going to run shoulders with kids that don't know if they're boy or girl there's only a group of people that know their gender identity why because it's been revealed to them through their father amen god bless you this morning it turned a little bit differently i i wanted to go a certain way but the lord just kind of changed me and that's okay you love him okay let's stand together this morning open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you [Music] you lord i want to see [Music] shining in the night of your glory go round your power and love as we sing [Music] i want to see [Music] see you maybe you've been struggling you know who i'm talking to if the shoe fits wear it maybe you've been struggling you just nah i don't know i don't know if this is for me or if it's just because i'm around these people is this message really true is jesus christ really real i challenge you to ask god ask him get serious and if you'll get on your knees and you'll you'll get serious and you'll ask him you know what he'll do he will reveal himself i did that with god i wasn't raised in church my parents were not religious and i yeah i went to a bible study and yeah had a great time and yeah i felt his presence but i i i said god you gotta would you reveal yourself to me i don't know if i'm going to accept it or not but if you just show me if you just show me at least all i'll know what to do at that time then i either accept or reject when i found the love of jesus i found out that he loved me for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life you know what when i heard that i said i believe i believe in jesus i believe in him enough that i want to serve him how about you enough that i want to serve him i don't want to just talk about him i don't want to just read about him i want to walk with him i want to walk with him you've been struggling you've been having a hard time it's good for you makes you come to the realization really who you are what do you believe i was preaching in germany another time a young man that again raised in the message just struggling with it and he said if if i don't get something this morning i'm leaving i'm out of here i'll never come back to church again and while i preach there was something i said that he knew he knew god was speaking directly to him amen his life he's a awesome god he's supernatural he moves and weighs beyond our thinking and maybe he's speaking been trying to get your attention and you've been running and you've been trying to avoid it he's after you don't don't keep running i'm not i don't ask you to come to the altar i don't ask you to raise your hand even i just say the altar is in your heart god's dealing with you right now why don't you make an altar in your heart and why don't you say father now those of you that are christians and know that god is dealing with somebody in here why don't you just get real spiritual right now once you raise your hand up and say father god you're doing something here there's somebody here that needs a touch there's somebody here lord i put my antenna up i want to be sensitive i want to be sensitive and father lord i i don't know who it's for maybe everyone here is saved i don't know but if i feel this way lord i i know it's you
