the Lord Brother James if you would [Music] come praise the Lord I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord is that what your heart was telling you tonight I'm sure many of you tired and actually driving in to church a little while ago and my wife said uh you going to turn in your praise report and I said what what praise report she goes your elbow I said oh yeah that's right and then I got here and guess what I didn't do I didn't turn in my praise report so I guess the Lord knows that he was wanting me to tell this this a little testimony 3 years ago I come up for prayer and my body has been cursed with arthritis a bad my joints my back and shoulder and neck hands and it just knots and and I come up for prayer and I've been taking medicine and you know that stuff just eats your stomach up and all these things so you take a pill for that and then you take another pill for the stomach and you done this for years and and uh every time you get the MRI they say oh this just arthritis and it's getting worse and you know how it goes so I come up for prayer 3 years ago and I claimed my healing then and God had led me into some different things in my wife and put different people in our lives different remedies and things that all kind of seemed to work together in my body and hadn't taken no medicine for a long time and then all of a sudden seemed like on Saturday just Cat come scratching at the door and boy I tell you this arm was hurting so bad I just couldn't even hardly Sunday morning lift a cup of coffee and I come up ask brother Ron to pray again and we got home and she goes what did you get prayer for and I said you know that elbow and I thought that elbow thank you Lord that elbow that shoulder that hand look at that you know amen so God still moves Saints [Music] the devil can come knocking but he's just a bluff the prophet told us right so we got needs tonight we got pray reports we got needs sister Sandy brother Ezra and he's back anybody that's ever suffered but we know when Jesus said it's finished he didn't say maybe he didn't say might he said it is the whole work everything Redemption healing if you can believe you're saved you can believe you're healed it all was completed he done it all in that one act and I tell you I believe it all we need to reach out with faith tonight and say Lord I take what you've done for me already it's already done folks it's already done let's pray Heavenly Father we come to you this evening Lord a needy people there was hands up my hand was raised there's always something Lord but that's what makes you God it's what makes you mighty the almighty God is because when we have a need we have a place to run to there is a bomb in Gilead and oh [Music] Lord we believe Lord

graise and I bring greetings from Brother Byer Johnson the pastor of Calgary Living Word assembly and they bring their loves and greetings to each and everyone and also to the friend of the Boyers their family and friends they send their loves and greetings as well and uh it's really a great uh Fellowship out there so when we leave Phoenix it's about [Music] 114° so when we arrive there it's a 2 degrees so it's just like winter and but it's really nice because although it's cold but full of sunshine it's really nice praise God and I trust that uh the Lord will uh be with us tonight and also I want to acknowledge the mendosa family for giving me a wonderful gift this the handkerchief with a letter C I try to keep it as a souvenir and just look at it but I realize that it will not serve its purpose if I just display it so I as well using it tonight so thank you the mosa family praise God and uh we will go just Direct to the word of God tonight and I think that's the most important thing and I have two portion of scriptures uh the first one Zechariah 13: 6 and Luke 17 verse 25 Zechariah 13:6 said and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hand then he shall answers those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends Luke 17 verse 25 but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of these Generations so my title is God's Masterpiece and the subject is the rejected king and the SMI and bride and may the Lord are a blessing upon the reading of his word you may now be seated so the rejected king and the SMI bride and we know that God has mostly always been rejected by men as king it seems like man chose to rulle over by anything else but God he'll be ruled over by his drug habit he will be ruled over by his passion he will ruled over by his denominations he'll be ruled over by opinions of others or his own philosophy about life but he'll even try to be his own God and King and ruled and Lead himself but we find that all of his leadership only lead him to disaster and death because anything outside of the leadership of the Holy Ghost will only lead a men to ruination we cannot lead by our own self in amen we need God above all things so in 1 Samuel 8:7 speaking about Samuel which is the prophet of God Amen and the Lord said unto Samuel herken unto the voice of the people in all they in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them remember that Prophet always a prophet always represent God to the people amen where in the priest represent present the people to God then the prophet represent praise God and the prophet represent God to the people so every time that the prophet uh speak the word it must always be thus said the Lord amen so sometimes people reject the prophet and when they reject the prophet they're not re actually rejecting the person but they are actually rejecting God Amen so in these last days every sin can be forgiven by the time you blaspheme the Holy Ghost it cannot be forgiven anymore and we know that the prophet in these last days is the Holy Ghost amen amen so when Christ came he was also a rejected King because when he came to his own his own received him not in John 1 verse 10- 11 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own praise God with received him and his own rejected him this is always the case amen and the greatest thing that can hurt our our our our heart is the one that is near to us and we will notice that he was Lov by God but falsely falsely accused and rejected by his Brethren just like Joseph he was loved by his his father but he was rejected by his brethren and also the bride in this last days praise God we are loved by God by revealing to us the word but we are rejected by all denominational in this word amen in Zechariah we can say in Chapter 13 Verse uh 6 and one shall say unto him what are these wound in thy hand then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends so we see the same thing taking place even in the Book of Job and we know that God never Chang his pattern if there is a pattern there is always a continuity of that amen every time we see it in the old Old Testament we can apply in our today so when God was reject so is so was job job was a righteous man but when God tried him all his friend that he he is relying to comfort him in time with strouble is the one that rejected him and accuse him as a a secret sinner but we know that joob knew that he had offered the appropriate burnt offering to God on behalf of his sin and and we know that job himself was also a symbol and form of the burnt offering he became a Living Sacrifice in that hour because we see that everything that job possessed had been taken from him his business his finances his family his children everything Hallelujah and all things that were due to him had been completely taken away from him and consumed the life the prosperity that he had once known was now laying complete ruins and Ashes and he himself is also an asip and job had been reduced to uses but his life had become a sweet sailing sweet smelling saber unto God it's no different from us what what job had been through Hallelujah in one way or another we can experience it in our lives yes God allowed job to be Smitten by Satan even though job was a righteous man so that is sometimes the mystery why God allowed suffering to each and every one of us God also allowed Christ to be smitten at Calvary even though he was a righteous man and God in this hour will also allow the bride to be smitten even though she has been made righteous by the bleeding word of this hour so we've learned that job said the resurrection and job is also a type of the Bride in these last days in the Book of Job in chapter 1 verse 8 we are all familiar about the life story of Job amen but we cannot run away from that type because job represent Resurrection job 1:8 and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant that there is none like him in this earth yes a perfect and upright man one that fearth God and Es sketh evil an upright man and perfect in the sight of God hallelujah we know that job is the same likewise with us born in sin come to the word speaking lies amen but in the sight of God he was righteous he was upright in the sight of God he commit when we say perfection is doesn't mean he become absolutely Flawless but we see the job how he was so upright he served god with with with fervency with righteousness in his heart amen what God called righteous because job has a perfect sacrifice it doesn't matter how how many mistakes or our flows within our heart but the way that God looks at our sacrifice the perfect sacrifice so in the eye of God we become perfect because in the Old Testament when the worshiper come into the Altar and bring the sacrifice to the priest the priest is no longer looking at the mistakes of the worshipper but he is looking at the perfect sacrifice and if it's that perfect then say come bring again another sacrifice which is perfect without spot and without wrinkle and we know we have a perfect sacrifice and that is the Lord Jesus Christ hallah we have a perfect sacrifice so that's why in the eye of God we are already perfect even though you are fless but God knows your desire Hallelujah so perfect means doesn't imply absolute flawlessness instead it signifies that job was sincere in his desire to be whole and righteousness again because if we are in the Press we are struggling day by day we commit mistakes we have flows we think sometimes bad sometimes our decision sometimes we speak rude Hallelujah but God in the eye of God we are still perfect God's scription emphasize job's unwavering faith and commitment to righteousness even in the Bas of immense suffering right now God knows our heart we are struggling day by day we are trying to conv we have committed mistakes but it is a consolation that God said have you considered my bride to be perfect and upright in the sight of God God is is so proud of each and every one of us because he knows our desire even tonight if we come to church we don't come here to be to be sinen we come it with sincerity in our heart asking and looking for God to speakto us God knows each and every ones of us but God is coming here amen maybe using just a simple brother to speak the word and that word even though simple it was if it's meant to give it to you it will Quicken that word into life amen hallelujah have you considered this bright they are upright and perfect in the sight of God who is SK means Hallelujah Turning Away From Evil we have desired to turn away from Evil Hallelujah notice that God called job a perfect man he was a masterpiece in the sight of God but now God is going to allow this masterpiece to be Smith and to be misunderstood by his three friend and to be rejected by them as a secret Sinner and job is a type of the Bride this last day at the end of the seven Church ages hallelujah amen we are the Masterpiece of God but we are being rejected and Pritt and smitten Hallelujah and we will notice in the order of the books that preceded the book of job I we know that God is Sovereign and we know that the Bible is comprises of 66 chapter written by 40 different authors over the span of approximately 1,500 years and second Peter 1:21 said that all the prophecy came not in Old Times by men as they were by old men by the of men but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost 66 chapter 14 different auar but God hallelujah is the one who arranged each and every one of us hallelujah because God is not the author of confusion because God is the author of order even by the books he ordered it Hallelujah they are in order amen and Israel nayah is God's people coming back to Homeland after the 70 years captivity in Babylon which represent the seven CH ages so Israel and nayah they are the the they are the Restorations amen which is type of the Bride that being restored after the Captivity we have also seen a people called the bride of Christ in this hour coming back to the homeland of the word of the seven Church ages praise God our homeland is the restored word of Malachi 4 and revelation 10:7 amen but then look at the struggle that the Jews had when they got back to their Homeland after 70 years of captivity and they began to repair the Broken Walls that had been broken down but look at the rejection and the persecution that they had to face when they began to restore those walls Hallelujah they are being restored back to their Homeland but they were persecuted rejected Hallelujah so we the bride of Jesus Christ we realize the truth of the message of the hour but when we it's time for us to to share we are being rejected we are being persecuted we are being called by different kinds of words and Bram and chist all of that but the bride know herself then after the book of isra and nemiah came the book of Easter praise God after the restoration the revealing of the Bride of Jesus Christ and Easter was a bride at the time when hmon was plotting to destroy all the Jews from the face of the Earth and we are also living in a time when all Nation are prophesied to plot against against Israel to try to destroy them again in this day that we are living in and we can see and observe what's happening around the world right it didn't happen thus by chance it happens according to prophecy and prophecy must be fulfilled and we thank God that we have now the pattern that we can see Hallelujah so that's why we don't fear what will be happening because the scripture said when all these things come to us look up your Redemption is draw it near it is a sign for us to give to to Rejoice don't be discouraged don't be fear but always look up amen encourage yourself encourage one another our time is too short Hallelujah there is no more time to look back Hallelujah if you look back look back what God has done for your life you never come to this place unless it was by the grace of God and when you look up don't be discouraged what is happening amen don't look up and say it was God himself who lead me all the way up to this time no man helped me to stand Hallelujah but it was God's grace to continue to move with each and every one of us the same history that you find in the book of Easter is representing itself again in our day then we see that after Easter is the Book of Job yeah Hallelujah so we look at the Bible now in different we look different when the seal was open we read the Bible different yes compared to our former experience with the denomination everything God set in order because the book The Bible is a book of Prophecy am Job who God called a perfect man and Pastor is me beaten and condemned and rejected by his friend as a secret sinner Christ was our rejected King and husband and when he came to Earth he was rejected by his own friends like job was and we know that he was also smitten and then resurrected so we will notice the pattern of events before the resurrection take place and we know there is a resurrection as I preach while ago that Resurrection is the person it's not only an event but it is a person and you need to know the person of the Resurrection before you will be in the event of the Resurrection hallelujah it's now coming you need to know because the the the time you hear it the the the word of God even though you are dead you will still be alive praise be to God hallelujah and we know that he was m and then resurrected notice the pattern be B before the resurrection take place there is a rejection and smiting of the Masterpiece have we observed it so many are against the message of the hour there is a rejection that's sming and sometimes we wonder why it happened sir but then we realize that what happened then is happening now there is a rejection smiting before the resurrection so we see in the Book of Job but before he job saw the resurrection he was first smitten and rejected and so we see that job is a type of Christ and job is also a type of the end time rde of this day last days after the seven Church ages and just before the resurrection of the sleeping Saints for the prophet of this generation praise God said that if we cannot see Christ in every chapter in every verse and every line then let us go back again and read the word of God hallelujah in the message 78th week of Daniel paragraph chapter 1 paragraph 101 he said now may but now in the in these seven Church ages that we have went through the Gentile time from the crucifixion until the end of the church ages now we got we've been through it all now now we're getting to a place where we can hit and go into the seven seal seven vials seven trumpets and all that is pictured together all dealing with the Jew and God's judgment to the people upon the earth and the remnant So speaking about the 7 week of Daniel he said that now we got we've been through it all down now we're getting to a place where we can hit and go into the seven seal and we know that the seven seal praise God belongs to the bride of Jesus Christ and the Seven trumpet belongs to the to the Jew and the Seven vials of those who reject the word of the hour so remember that seven trumpet and all that is pictured together all dealing with the Jews and God's judgment to the people upon the earth and the remnant remember the seven Thunders are for the bride amen and we all know that the Thunder is a message so there are seven Thunders there were seven voices that were given to the to to to the seven Church ages amen and the Seven trumpet are to the Jews and the Seven bals are to the unbeliever which is when the Judgment of God are being poured out on all the ones who have rejected the message of the hour in the form of the two Elijah's anointing of brother bham and the message of Moses Elijah to the 144 Jews remember in this great time of persecution there's million of Gentiles will die in that that rejected bride that remnant of the woman seed the sleeping virgin goes right through that so after the bride is rejected and smitten and ruptured we see that the remnant which is the foolish virgins remember that they were virgins the foolish and the wise virgin the difference is only the oil they have oil but not not enough to meet praise God the son of man because they are they are asking for more oil from the wise virgins so they have enough oil they don't have enough oil so they have only oil that they were Justified they were Justified they were Sanctified and sometime they are baptized with the Holy Ghost but they lack the oil of the person of the Holy Ghost himself that's why they are asking for more right but they cannot move on because they were designated for that portion of scripture only that's why when you are bride of Jesus Christ and when you recognize that you need to be the most praise God happiest person around the earth when you recognize who you are because when you recognize that the who you are then the rupture has but that Quicken your heart amen you have the Assurance you have the the the the the spiritual rest of all the chaos of all the word you can find spiritual West knowing that everything God is in order amen yes and the prophet said remember in this great time of persecution there's million of Gentiles will die that rejected bride that remnant of the woman SE amen she goes right through that we are already being rejected now by the denominations today as we can see the three conditions required for the smiting are already uniting together there is three power uniting for the purpose of smiting the bride or rejecting the Bride of Jesus Christ amen there are religious power political power and demons power and remember that is how Christ was also smitten it took all three powers to unite together to Smite Jesus Christ there was Judas which said the demon power there was the Pires of usage of religious power and the Romans the political power three groups so what follow the rejected bride is the SMI bride amen but just before they can put her to death like they did with Jesus the resurrection and the rupture takes place and when and then the remnant of the woman see the foolish virgins go on to be killed during the tribulations period so before the smth and rejection the will take place and we can see all around they they they have a law sometime they close the church amen they accuse us of anti-government whatsoever but Before Time Hallelujah then the Rapture will go when the squeezing time comes amen and I believe it will not take how many years it will not take 20 years more Hallelujah we are really too close we are already over the Ephesian Church age amen so Ephesian Church age lasted 107 years but L here we are now more than 107 years although the prophet said that this L is the shortest age among the seven Church ages but we are now over praise God 1170 more than the Ephesian Age and what are you expecting are we expecting to stay here for a little bit 100 years 50 years 20 years no Hallelujah any moment in our life we need to expect every every every step that we make we need to expect something from God you plan praise God it's okay you can plan 100 years but you need to live just like he will be coming tomorrow Hallelujah if you have expectation expect that the rupture will come sir actually it will not come it will go because the rupture has already taken place in your life because said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and what is the shout it was the message of the hour and you receive the message of the hour that's why you come here God you hear the shout of the voice of the seventh angel which was the voice of God speaking through him because a prophet always represent God as the prophet said I don't come here and and introduce myself but I come here to introduce Christ to each and every one of you we are not following a man but we are following Christ Christ yes sir yes sir the god in this last day which is now the revealed word of the hour oh hallelujah our time is too short my brothers too too short for us to quarrel with one another to argue with one another to be rude with one another to think about something bad about one but it's time to clean our heart clean our mind of rudiness Amen of busness or gous whatsoever we need to clean our heart my brother and sister and expect for the Rapture to come am don't expect for our euny to come better that's why I pity our young couple marriage couple Hallelujah they will struggle a lot because of the inflations and all the thing that they come through but praise be to God Amen God will make the time short or else no one will be saved yes looking for that amen young couple you need to encourage one another time is too short let us just praise God let us just worship God let us rejoice God Amen don't look yourself don't look at whatever situation you are in look at the promise of God because God will supply all your needs according to the riches of his glory and know how how how short you are maybe financially but God is able to meet your need according to the richness of his glory even Elijah said okay go and rest because Jezebel is looking for you go to the go go to the the to the brook Chariot and have rest and I will sustain you while you are [Applause] resting if we rest upon the promises of God he will sustain its needs according to the riches of his God don't struggle very much just leave it unto the Lord just like the first time when brother Ron asked me few years ago brother Mario I want you to preach in my my church and I told him brother Ron you know my English is not uh fluent and give it to some brothers who are good in English I it's it's enough for me to just sit down and listen and enjoy the word of God anyway being a Believer and a medic we we just the same reward until the time has come that I cannot refuse and I say okay amen and every time he told me brother Mario you can preach and I say brother Ron just give me at least two weeks to prepare cuz I need to translate my thought into English English so some sometimes I speak broken English but thank God we don't have discrimination here in America but in the Philippines when you have a grown grammars you will be discriminated oh you have a wrong grammar you don't but in America They Don't Really they are not particular in grammars especially the message of the hour what they are looking for is the thought of God coming from the mouth of the preacher and I believe God is the one who will give that inspiration not the preacher we are just a mouthpiece of God that's why when brother run tell me you brother may you go Don't Preach then sometimes I struggle very much two weeks in preparation but no never have a thought what to preach even though how read I study and everything doesn't come give me the inspiration it give me I become nervous and nervous and sometimes let's say Wednesday Tuesday no nothing no inspiration no nothing and sometimes I'm so nervous and I told myself maybe this will be the cause that I will have a high blood pressure maybe I will tell brother Ron brother Ron I will stop preaching because I might have a heart attack in the P I am so nervous because I struggled every time I struggled I struggled Lord Lord what will I preach Lord what will I preach then the time has come that God told me just relax don't struggle let me speak through your mouth I learn praise God to relax I learn to trust God I learn to get away from my mind and I learn to humble myself Lord if you called me to preach then put something in my heart that I can preach to the people of God I don't want people to look at me but they every time I preach may they see you in the manifestations of your word Lord not a person standing here but the word that is being revealed into your heart amen that's why I try to become relaxed and the more I relax the more God revealed himself unto us he gave more word added one word upon one word upon one word and another and I realized the prophet said that a real gift is letting yourself get out of the way the same with us my brother don't struggle of the things that we can see the inflations the high rises of the apartment of the mortgages just relax everything is under control because he said I will never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah just trust in God don't have fear don't took anything just relax as the Lord just relax sometimes it's a hard thing just to relax but we need to practice it just relax because everything is under control and God said I will never leave you nor forsake you I will meet all your needs according to the riches of my glory and sometimes we can not receive so much blessing because sometimes let's say this we don't give tights because that is a challenge of God if you want to be blessed give your tithes unto the house of the Lord and that TI not belong to us but it belong to God God gave us Works God gave us businesses and God requires only 10 part of what he has given us to return to him and that is the secret of prosperity we are not pro we are not preaching about Prosperity but God promis it I will prosper you in help amen if you are faithful in giving your tithes and offering unto the Lord he will return it and he challenge us there is no windows of Heaven there's no door or window amen because it it will it will be overflowing and that is really uh I and you need to have a personal experience about that when we IM migrated here in America we were in California and when we were there the uh my children said why we are here Dad you know that the prophet told us that California will sink why we are here and I told him no we are just temporary amen we will not stay here forever we will have find some place so when we when we when we arrived in La so we just prayed Lord give us a church that we can come and fellowship and I search all the internet I have told it before but I just want to be an uh an inspiration to somebody else we don't seek for works but we need to seek the kingdom of God first and works will follow and during the time we don't have any money and by God's grace he he put everything in order and I met a man and uh told they have a house forent and he asking for 1,200 and I just told him we just came from the Philippines we are just new here and we don't have enough money for the down payment no problem just pay when you can find job but we don't have any down payment it's okay I'll give you 800 wow praise God and I thought 800 maybe that's just a simple uh little bit house to bed something thing we don't see the man we don't see the house because we were at that time in California and he was here in Arizona in other words we close our transaction just come no don't pay no down payment and just pay 800 when you can find job just come God or castrated everything and during the time there was no fear in my heart and I don't no but the only thing that comes into my seek ye the first the kingdom of God first and all these things shall be added unto you that scripture it did magnify in my heart that is the only scripture that I'm holding during the time we don't have any money my money is only good for the next two months and that's it but there was no fear in Josephine and my children we are just enjoying my children don't know what is happening you know when we arrive praise God we don't have any appliances and it was my youngest daughter birthday and we just celebrate and enjoy everything because God already given us a church that we can fellowship with yeah Hallelujah so Tuesday brother Ron came with brother Matthew and all the children and I and I said to myself this must be a good pastor he welcome us with his kids his grandchildren he must be a good pastor so we talk and Wednesday night praise God he welcoming this is from the Philippines they just knew and they will make this their uh home church and after the service brother Ron and sister Sandy uh bring the folding folding table capacity of six sister Sandy and brother Ron and they delivered it into our house and that was our first appliances we are so happy and I was so overwhelmed we don't expect that and because in the Philippines we were the one who really support all those uh brother sister come away we are the one who supported without thinking anything in return so when I experienced the first thing that brother R sister Sunday brought was the fing church I was so uh I was so amazed then the following day some of the brothers came with the sofa and the bed utensils and within one week and the house that I was renting by the way is a four-bedroom house wow for 800 and it's so amazing and I realize that truly the word of God if you stand true to that word he will fulfill it and he will magnify it into your life seek ye first the kingdom of all these things shall be added unto you that was 2007 almost 17 years ago and God is still faithful we still have our ups and down but God hallelujah assured us I will be with you don't worry have peace and relax Hallelujah don't try it yourself because the more you try it by yourself the more you fail but you just commit everything unto God knowing that he will never Hallelujah leave you nor forsake you and being God he always fulfill his word and manifest his word praise God so we have been studying in The Book of Life and the two sections of the book of life and Revelation then is the revealing of names so we've been preaching it brother Ron preached it brother Steven preached it brother brother Freddy preached The Book of Life and we realize that Revelation 10 the open book actually is the name being called by the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I saw Revelation 10 chapter 1 and I saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud and rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand little book open and he has in the right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice and when a lion wor it and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices so this thunder is calling our names so that's why we we often read Revelation 10 because this is our scripture we are identified in the scripture when the seven Thunders uttered their voices it was the name being called and the name is being called by the mystery that is was being revealed into our day and you responded to the mystery of who you are in this last days that is the name God is calling us Revelation 10:1 that is our scripture in the every age there is a scripture being fulfilled and this is our scripture amen amen the name calling your name is being called praise God from the open book in this hour that is why when the word of this hour is being spoken you respond with an amen because you are hearing from your Tony the more the revelations being preached the more you can say Amen because you saw yourself in the word that is being revealed and you can say I am that I am what you're speaking about I am the one that you're preaching about I am identifying myself to that word you are hearing actually from brother you are hearing from your company that's why you can say Amen to every word that is being revealed and you cannot stop saying amen because amen is Jesus Christ the amen of God Hallelujah you respond with an amen here to your name being called like the baby iglet responded to the eagle Squam because that is your name being called from the Lamb's section of the book of life amen so Revelation 10 is the Lamb sections of the book of life being revealed and names being called forth but Revelation 20 at the great white turn judgment is the revealing of the rest of the names that that remain in the regular section of the Book of Life am Revelation 20: 11-15 and I saw great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fleed away and there was no found no place for them and I saw dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life amen and dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave of the Dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works this is The Book of Life and the death and hell were cast into the lake of Pride this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire so Revelation 10 is the Lamb sections of the book of life being revealed names are being called amen and that is taking place right now under the sounding of this message but Revelation 20 is the revealing of all the rest of the names of the regular Book of Life and we realize that we are now in the Harvest Time that's right and harvest time is the end of the world whatever see that you are planted in the beginning praise God will become seed again at the Harvest Time at the maturity Harvest time is when all the seeds at the beginning are revealed of what their true region is and that is being revealed Now by how the people responds to the word of this hour you will know what kind of seed You Are by the way you respond to the word that was being revealed in your day this is an identification time because the word of God said Hallelujah to the Propet take your pen and write Genesis let every seed bring forth of its kind whatever seed you are praise God you will manifest in this last days because this is the Harvest Time praise be to God and if you are the seed of God you will manifest God which is the word in your life am and the fruit was in the seed so don't worry about the fruit if you are the seed of God and the light which is the spoken World light it will Quicken that seed don't struggle for the proof just lay in the presence of the sunlight and you will grow your patience will grow your breadly kindness will grow your Temperance will grow praise God your love will grow you don't manufacture it you don't struggle about it because the more you struggle for that fruit I know you will fail somewhere and sometimes it can discourage you why didn't I I make I didn't make it your patience barely caness from in your Temperance you will fail and you will go back again and you will become discouraged but in galatian Paul said the fruit of the Spirits are patience Temperance brotherly kindness love they are called fruit singular so when you have the Holy Spirit all those fruit will manifest sooner or later God will bring circumstances in your life and it will cultivate right whatever fruit that you are in that seed it will manifest circumstances will come and will manifest your faith it will manifest your patience it will manifest your Temperance in whatever situation you are in Hallelujah so you don't struggle am just recognize who you are and the fruit will manifest in itself not fruits plural but fruit singular but have three old nine manifestation amen amen so the fruit was already in the seed you just need to recognize who you are and when the seed was quickened you cannot help but bear fruit amen you don't struggle for your to bear fruit because the Sheep don't struggle to to have wool they don't manufacture wool they just eat and eat and eat and eat and it will just grow and grow and grow that's why some of us cannot understand the message of the hour when we sometimes we preach seven Thunders restoration praise God we PR we speak about predition some is just looking at the air they don't understand it what you're what we are speaking about because if you don't read the message or listen to the message you will not understand what the preachers preach we are preaching with inspiration but sometimes as if nobody knows about it because they are just depending on somebody who is preaching and sometimes they cannot cut up the thought of what we are preaching because they are not reading or listening to the word that's why John said blessed are they which read the word and hear the word so we don't H we don't have any excuse anymore if you cannot hear you can still read you have no excuse you need to read the word of God in order to understand because if you read the word I cannot finish my sentence but you don't already know what the direction of what I'm preaching because you have already read it and sometimes you read it but it takes the spirit of God the gift of God to Quicken the word that you're reading that you cannot understand and sometimes we read how many times how many times when the preacher come and preach and say oh that's wow that's wonderful I just know what's the revelation of it because you read it just like each and every one of us had a spoken word we can read just like somebody was going to school they have the textbook and they they they were assigned to read a certain chapter in their book and when you come to school we will read something like that and all the stud are reading and reading and reading sometimes they canot understand what they're reading but when the teacher stand and teach them they can say oh wow why didn't I see it why didn't I see it oh that's what it means so it takes the gift of God to Quicken the word that's why it's so important to have the fivefold ministry in the church this is not a onean Ministry this is the fivefold ministry that will bring us into the ification to the Perfection of the Saints sir sir and all this Bible Ministry day are not competitors they are companions we have the purpose to point everybody to the word of God until we come into the unity of the faith the faith that can turn this body into immortality that is the main focus of the fivefold ministry but if the fivefold ministry is preaching about himself you need to put a question mark on that because the scriptures of the fivefold Ministry it was the gift of God sent to the church that's why even though we preach we don't claim it is our preaching it's no it's not our thought that's why sometime they say oh thank you B Mar you bless me with your son no it's not my sermon it was God for you yes and the more I preach the word I become a partakers of that word and sometime that word that is being preached there is also being preaching to me I have nothing to do with that it was God himself speaking to each and every one of us we are just an instrument of the word of God that is being spoken that's why if a Minister preach in the pulpit and you see somebody always preaching about himself you need to have question mark on that that's why a real Minister cannot see any you cannot see him speaking about himself always speaking Christ the word of God Amen that's why when we come out you can say brother Mar praise the Lord praise the Lord it was God speaking to you not brother Mario I have nothing to do with that I am just a mouthpiece of God Amen and I thank you that you recognize the presence of God you are always saying amen and sometimes I question if my word is is exactly the right word to pray sometimes I wonder about that but when I see you smiling praise the Lord they cut it amen hallelujah so we are not particular about the words we are particular about the moving of the whole Spirit Among Us amen although how simple it was but if it's the spirit of God we will rejoice about it because I always say nding of our head and just smiling cannot give Justice to what God has given us as brother stepen said it was the grace of God unmeritable unmit uh favor unmerited favor we have nothing to do with it it's just all by the grace of God Amen we have one focus and one attention and that is to be with the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so let us pray for one another pray for the ministers praise God that God will bring us closer unto himself as the as the prophet said Christ The Mystery of God will and someday when you recognize who you are then the Rapture will go it will not come it is already here but it will go when you don't have any doubts anymore you don't have any unbelief anymore Hallelujah you just walk according as Enoch is walking as the light was being revealed he's just walking amen he don't question he just walk until he was found not and I believe we are the same let us just walk Hallelujah live of the word amen they have chaos they have this fear trembling we just walk in the light of the message of the hour and someday praise God we will just was not he was not but he had a testimony before his translation that he pleased God you can only please God by accepting the revealed word in the hour no doubt no question no mislocation of the word no misinterpreting of the word praise God hallelujah just believe the word of God in lysia church age this laia age end in a black out of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stand outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit these little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus Hallelujah we are hunted and persecuted in the message of the Masterpiece brother bam tell us that the Masterpiece must first be SM before it can speak Joseph was rejected and Smitten by his Brethren before he ascended to the power that when he spoke the whole Kingdom of Egypt obeyed him God allowed the three Hebrew children sadrach mesak and Abednego to be Smitt by being thrown into the fa furnace before the forthman appear with them so before job could come to the resurrection we see that he first had to be smitten he had to be rejected by his Brethren like Joseph and Christ was so we see the same pattern runs throughout the Bible once you see the pattern in the Bible and you realize that God is the same yesterday today and forever you'll come to realize that God never changed changes his way of doing things pattern in the word never changes once you see a pattern establish it never changes that's why we have can have confidence in the word of God Amen we can look at the Old Testament of what God is doing in there still doing the same that's why we can confidence that God is already with us Amen in the message uh the rising of the sun when he preached in April of 1965 the word must become stronger as the sun continue to rise it is the rising of the Sun so it is as brother Ron always said that the the prophet don't just preach in a a just a sermon and give a title but it was a always a declaration so the word must become stronger as the sun continue to rise and the day continues on because you cannot ripen the whe with the strength of a early sun the sun must keep rising in height and strength and keep getting stronger and hotter amen as the prophets we need to lay in the presence of the Sun in order to take away the greenness away from us amen we need to be in the in in the presence of the Sun that is why any ministers in the message that are preaching the message at the level of strength of the sun began Rising back in 1965 will not be able to bring their people out of greenness if that minister is just preaching about the prophet visited in this generation about his life story about the story in his life the Miracles in his life you can never get the greatness away from that from the people but we need to go in the Str of the sun to take away the greenness out of the people am we cannot remain just believing there was a prophet in the land which is that's good but we need to recognize the message of the Prophet that was given in our day because he said when the seal was open I must decrease and he must increase and the word of God must increase in our life to take away the greenest out of us well we it cannot satisfy that just knowing there was a prophet in the land although we believe it but the message didn't stop at just believing the prophet is in the land cu the prophet said God will do thing do things Malachi 4 turn the heart of the children back to the father Revelation 10:7 praise God the revealing the son it will be this two Ministry that will literally turn the heart of the children back to the original Faith to have rapturing faith in these last days the message the Masterpiece now the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also what a statement so if you claim to be the bride and you need to claim it if you recognize the message of the hour then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just smitten piece off of him there is the Masterpiece it was smitten and Michel Angelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but God is going to do it he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there is the Masterpiece the family back again in the garden of be so our restoration is not only on the day of Pentecost but our restoration is back to the Garden of Eden again we are Beyond Pentecost my brother and sister this message will bring us back into the original Hallelujah back in the Eden am praise be to God and the B said oh Church of the Living God bow your hearts and yourselves before God these things are true and I know that it sounds like that as such a great thing as that would be would be so spread out over the nation it never was he doesn't change amen just be thankful Church be thankful that you are where you are today if you're in Christ be thankful for where you are today in Christ because you don't come all the way by yourself it was Christ in you calling your name to manifest in these last days because you are the mystery of God that's Smitt side of the Masterpiece being restored back again in this last day just be thankful Church be thankful that you see where you are today if you're in Christ because when remember all that life will be gathered right into the grain for the resurrection amen but the stock must be burned and the rest of it the hus and all must be destroyed and it will be don't trust in your D denomination you stay in the word the life God and His Masterpiece amen then what it is in the Millennium Christ and his bride back in the garden of the Millennium again Hallelujah so let us stand to our feet tonight Hallelujah I trust that it will encourage you sometimes you wonder why why I being rejected why am being smitten you are God's Masterpiece my huah you are being restored back yes sir Hallelujah to the original Masterpiece you see in the Book of Ruth in the Bible her life had been smitten but in the end we find that she was resurrected through a process of redemption job's life was M he was rejected but in the end we find that he is also resurrected and restored back to his former Prosperity again a type of Eden remember that what job lost in chapter one God restored it at the last chapter in double portion amen hallelujah God is in it all you may suffer today you may say depress whatever you lost amen hallelujah God will restore it in a double portion at the end of your trial and the end of your testing because the Masterpiece is already being restored again Amen in the last days hallelujah Joseph life was smitten Jesus life was smitten why because they were all God's Masterpiece and so the Bride of this hour must also be smitten that is the entire picture of the Bible we were smitten rejected but that we are God's Masterpiece Hallelujah the Bible is one big story of redemption God and man coming back into Union together Back to Eden again not back to Pentecost Back to Eden again Hallelujah we are Beyond Pentecost the prophet we are Beyond Pentecost the Pentecostal did it already amen they become emotional doing praise God emotions all those Mighty signs and wonders God is being restored that but we are beyond that we are going back again into the mind of God as Jesus Christ said I came from God and I go back to God hallelujah how do you know that you go back to the word go back to to God because your life Express the word yes sir and you cannot help it every moment of your life every trial is the word of God being made manifest you are the word being made manifest whatever things that comes your way it was the word remember that brother Braham in all his life it was the word of God in his life being made manifest he need to experience every word that was being revealed unto him Hallelujah and he Le the [Music] life and we cannot run away from our calling of who we are so we might as well surrender our elv un God yes Lord I can't do nothing Within Myself how much I run praise [Music] God even though how much we run if we are the seed of God we can always God will always find you just like Jonah he wants to run away from nineve but remember the scpt scripture that Jesus said that it was a whale that catch him when he committed suicide remember he committed suicide throw me in the ditch throw me in the ocean but remember that whale God created a whale even in the Book of Genesis so even before Jonah manifest his life God already prepared a whale before things happen in his life so that's why everything that comes our way God already provided a way just like our Salvation the Lamb of God prepared away praise God the blood of Jesus Christ Our name is written in the L's book of life before the foundation of the world you may run just like Jonah but God already prepared he knows the time will come for Jonah that he will run away but God created already a whale when that time comes it will already prepared for Jonah Hallelujah everything in our life is God has already prepared something so we just need to Rejoice knowing Lord hallelujah never leave me to forsake you I will stand according to your promise Lord let me humble
