him worship him for a thousand years hallelujah amen greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh I don't know if any of you heard U ewal Frank uh Pastor in celd Germany passed away so uh he was inst Al in helping to introduce this message around the world probably singlehandedly and I you know you give honor where honor is due amen he knew the prophet he spoke five languages uh he traveled more into more continents more countries dropping off the message of the hour introducing uh the prophet's message and uh for that um you cannot take that away from him he did that amen and uh so just pray for uh brother Bernard his son and and and ranada and sister Frank I believe she's still alive may God bless them Comfort them amen could have sister Carrie back and the kiddos good we miss them when you're gone and uh a bunch of others are still gone and summer camping and everything like that but that's okay cuz it gets hot here in the summer and you deserve to to go and enjoy and get away in the coolness amen um and I think brother James Gonzalez he's going to be joining the Marine Corps Le next Sunday is your last Sunday with us next Sunday so don't let me forget we want to pray for him before he goes young boy raised up here in the church now he's joining the military amen Lord watch over him amen amen Steve yes sir yeah amen yeah amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Luke Chapter n Matthew 26 so we'll go first to Luke chapter 9 verses 18- 21 and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that I am they answering said John the Baptist some say Elias others say that one of the old prophets is risen again some of you wonder where the doctrinal teaching even within the message of return Ministry comes from you even see it right here who do they say they were guessing they were trying to put it on something because they're trying to hear of something that's happening but they can't put put their finger on it so it must be John the Baptist or it must be one of the prophets risen again and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answering said the Christ of God and he straightly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing the revelation of Jesus Christ is so Sovereign and it is such a secret thing it's personal amen he says don't tell nobody I command you tell no man this father now in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this service into thy hands I pray Lord that you will give me words to say give them ears to hear of what the spirit is saying to the church we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you can be seated turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 26 Matthew 26 verses 59- 68 now the chief priests and elders and all the councel sought false witness against Jesus to put him to death when people are looking for something to find a mistake to find [Music] fault they'll look and they'll look hard but found none amen yay though many false Witnesses came yet found they none yeah at the last came two false Witnesses and said this fellow said I'm able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days now he said it amen but they thought it was the Holy Temple but it wasn't until he was was resurrected that they understood it was the Temple of his body amen and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these Witnesses against thee and Jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him I adure Thee by the Living God that thou has tell whether thou be the Christ the son of God but Jesus saith unto him thou H has said nevertheless I say unto you herea you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven amen then the high priest rent his clothes saying he has spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now we ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he's guilty of death then they did spit in his face buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands talk about a hatred saying prophesy unto us thou Christ who is he that smokee thee may God bless the reading of his word I'd like to continue on with this thought of the revelation of Jesus Christ part two and a subject the anointed word reveals our position in the body of Christ now like I said in our last service and may I reiterate it so you all understand what makes us different than all the rest what makes us think that God will hear our prayers God will answer them God will take it to his kingdom and I've just been pondering all of these things because saints of God God has done something very very Supernatural in this end time amen it has been on display and there were thousands of times that it was Vindicated of God God backs up his word yes he does we do not have to defend it God defends it himself you can see there that before the council and elders and they sought something that they could put him to death for and they said I adur Thee by the Living God if Thou Art the Christ tell us yet he held his peace who do you say that I am thou sayest but I'll tell you what makes us different than everyone else is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally thank you Lord You're not baptized in name father son Holy Ghost some trinitarian doctrine that you're baptized in the only name given among men whereby we must be saved the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for Peter on that day of Pentecost here and be well known among ye Brethren that this same Jesus whom you crucified God has this day made him both Lord and Christ amen thank you Lord hallelujah amen Luke chap 22 one more scripture reading please Luke 22: 63-71 and the men that held Jesus mocked him and smot him and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smoke thee and many other things blasphemously spake they against him and as soon as it was day the elders and the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their counsil saying art thou the Christ tell us and he said unto them if I tell you ye will not believe and if I also ask you you will not answer me nor let me go Hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God and they said they all art thou then the Son of God and he said unto them ye say that I am and they said what need we any further Witness es for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth God does not reveal himself to everyone these were religious people these were people who studied the law of Moses Revelation is not given to you by men neither taught to you by men that's you can't receive it from a man you can't receive it from your pastor may I say this you can't receive it from the prophet because the prophet can preach Revelation but you must have the ear to hear what the spirit is saying Thank You Lord The Secret of all this lies in the fact that Jesus had told Peter that flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I will build my church The Church of Jesus Christ is not built upon Peter it is built upon the solid rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ and guess what the Gates of Hell will try to Prevail against it but it cannot but it will try you will be in battle you will be tested that's right but you will be delivered hallelujah thank you Lord Revelation is the quickening power given to your understanding it is the illumination of your mind amen otherwise your minds are darkened the Bible says a carnally minded man cannot receive the things of God neither can he understand the things of God but it says you hath he quickened Hallelujah he has illuminated your mind he has shown into your parts of Darkness driven away the darkness so that you might see who you are when you catch the revelation of him on you also catch automatically the revelation of who you are where your pedigree where you come from and where you're going somebody say Amen if you get one you get the other revelation of the Holy Ghost is the power of transformation for every believer it changed Paul from a Pharisee to a born again Christian it changed Tax Collectors fishermen drunkards prostitutes turn them into Sons and Daughters of God it'll change denominational Christians of laiaa into Holy Ghost filled Bible Believers and Holy Ghost filled Believers in this time too somebody say Amen to that I am a witness to that thank you Lord Hallelujah Lord Saul had been taught all of the great religious teachings under Gia Paul began to brag and he says I am a Pharisee of Pharisees concerning the law blameless and he began to brag upon himself and he says but I consider all of this former learning is done that I might know Christ you see you can know religion you can have Commandments and understanding of some religious teaching and you can be religious no no doubt that Saul was very religious but it took an experience to meet the pillar of fire himself and there God blinded his eyes but opened his eyes amen and Saul of Tarsus became Paul of Damascus thank you Lord my God what does revelation do to a Believer am it is the quickening power it is the essence of God taking a dead letter taking a Bible that is closed and opening it up to bring it to your understanding for you to know that he's not three Gods he's one to know what God is doing in this hour allows you by the Holy Ghost Revelation to take your position in the body of Christ this whole message brings you positioning and placing you don't belong over there you belong here you don't belong doing that quit doing that come over here come out of her my people hallu Sir Paul said later in Galatians 1 11 and 12 but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man amen for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ you can be raised up in this message doesn't mean you believe the message right on you must have your own personal revelation of Jesus Christ chist to you personally otherwise we can talk about the prophet said this that but what do you [Music] say we're not careful it becomes religion we become the Amish of L you see you come on yeah only thing is we don't drive buggies we drive cars but they look at us as the Amish of laiaa oh you people with your rules and your long hair and your women wearing dresses God doesn't care how you dress God doesn't care how you live that is Jezebel religion that comes from the the great Harlot right and she has given out the wine a stimulation of the wrath of her fornication brother Brenham says how does a church how does a people how does a person commit adultery on Christ when you by their intercourse of your mind because the mind is the wound of the spirit and you knowing better by the inner course of the Mind add to or take away from the word of God you are absolutely committing adultery on Christ the word and God will put you away as an adulterous woman God help us Amen in the sermon adoption 1960 but the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that might have you you you merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself oh thank you Lord yeah somebody say thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen you just didn't stumble into it you didn't Merit it no not that you were so good that you went to a church one night that some poor uh brother LED you up to the altar it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world presented excuse predestinated you to eternal life thank you thank you Jesus what kind of person does that make you no wonder the T 24 Elders laid off their crowns everybody laid down their Crown everyone fell on our faces they didn't have one thing that they could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb God will gather in him somebody said say in him in thank you Lord God will gather in him all things that day and oh if we'd ever know and recognize who that was who they crucified you didn't stumble into this it wasn't your good following the law God came looking for you let me tell you this whether you know him right now or you don't and you sit here and you try to understand these things that I'm saying if you are a seed of God God's got an appointment hallelu and brother Brenham said God keeps all his appointments oh you can run but you cannot hide that's right you can say well it's not for me you can do like Jacob and be a Shyer you can go and hear all all the stories you can listen to the sermons you can go to church you can sing the songs of Zion you can learn the Bible verses come on that does not give you eternal life it just makes you religious what we need is to not be conformed but to be transformed Hallelujah by the quickening power of the revelation of Jesus Christ to the believer yes amen and that alone is what changes you any man can change his church but it takes God to change a heart you Lord thank you Jes what makes us different than all the other churches in the valley they're singing Jesus they got their robed choirs they're sincere and I say sometimes far more sincere than we amen come on they have their Christmas programs their Easter programs they have all kinds of rock and roll groups and they get up there and Jesus and they get everybody clapping and they're all happy on it's an anointing that's right it's anointed ones at the end time it we're talking about finding the Christ of God and I'm going to expand on this thought what is the Christ of God what was it that Peter said Peter who do you say that I am now making it personal who do you say that I am many times we hear it said from another portion of the scripture Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God blessed art thou Simon barjon yeah for Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock Hallelujah that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ is what God founds in your heart if you're a Christian if you're a true message believer you have the rock of the Revelation Hallelujah in your heart and that causes you to Play Your Part you Lord amen we're not looking for numbers we're looking for seed Hallelujah brother Bram says I go out there in the denominational world he says I say uh I have to be careful because I can't use words like predestination I have to use four or ordained but he says I say just enough of the word of God right that he said if there elect seed you see he doesn't put it upon how good he can preach it he doesn't put it on how eloquent his words are with all kinds of man's Wisdom he doesn't put it in there because of the robed choir and because of all of this and entertaining the people he said if there elect seed I say just enough of the word of God if there SE in there they will say Amen why word must respond to word if you're a word attribute you've got to when the word my goodness Lord help me speak this morning when the word preaches yeah there's a word in you that responds and it says yes and it says amen amen that's right prise the Lord and then you play your role that's right amen yes many of you were loud you see in women your shorts and your cut hair and your makeup but God rich in Mercy gave you Revelation and then you see and you come out of that and you play your part I'll never forget sister Jan oldum when she was here and you know it's married to brother Dennis she's passed on now but she was I I forget the name of the it's like Episcopalian one of these that's a kind of a s what was it you know she was Catholic but it was another branch of the Catholic Church long story short she she she uh did all the she sewed the robes she went into the the priest's area and she cleaned the area she did all of this stuff and so she came to um church because Dennis says well I'll tell you what if I go to your church once in a while will you go to mine okay so they he kind of had her to come and so as I'm preaching she's sitting there with her arms crossed like hm I ain't listening cuz I have my church and so anyway after church she says I'll have you to know brother Ron I have my own church and I'm only coming because of Dennis and I'll have you to know I sew the priest's garments and I do this and this and this and okay okay God bless you I'm not going to try to change you you know God bless you so Time After Time she'd come off went to earrings off went this and that and I noticed there's transformation taking place till one day after service you know what she said to me Steve she put a little finger in my face what are you doing to me you're changing me I said I ain't got nothing to do with it I'll tell you you know who's doing it he your father which is in heaven giving you re I never told her to come out of that he told her Hallelujah when God calls you he says come out of that nonsense come into the truth come into the Christ of [Applause] God thank you Lord I will pour out of my spirit yeah upon all All Flesh that's what you're seeing yes the glossia of God upon the just and the unjust true the rain falls on the wheat as well as the tears and the Bible says and do they not both raise up and praise God for the rain what makes us different so when you look at the C Gene of God all down through the scriptures and all down Through the Ages they are identified as the Christ of all ages I I will substantiate that it is the works that they do that identifies the characteristics of Christ because there is no word Christ in Old Testament it says they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit moved upon David the Holy Spirit moved on the prophets of B and they spake their words and their word they didn't even understand what they're saying but they were under an anointing amen God can only manifest himself in Godly attri rutes so they will have to play their part that God shows them to play do you understand it a religious spirit is a conforming Spirit yeah but a true Christlike spirit is a transforming Spirit Hallelujah a religious life is one that is Anointed by the Holy Spirit but not quickened to Life by the Holy Spirit you understand the difference oh you can go to church and there's a lot of Feelgood churches let's all sing when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be no matter what kind of life you live when we all see Jesus but what will the real Jesus say when he sees them depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you who deceived them was a seducing Spirit a religious spirit spirit amen a feel-good spirit yeah come on that's how they can get their masses yeah that's how they can get the big multitudes of people because they do not preach against sin amen that's it oh thank God that this Prophet had a two-edged sword thank you Lord the word that he spake was as a two-edged sword dividing between spirit and soul amen that's how the proph could say you can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit or on your body 24 hours a day and your soul black as night and on its way to hell that's rightly dividing the word of God that's a sharp two-edged sword amen my a religious life is one that's anointed by the spirit but not quickened to Life by the spirit a religious life is one that is governed by rules and regulations of the word and it will cause people to conform but it'll never transform them for there is no revelation of the spirit to make them uh genuine from their heart that's why Jesus says they honth me with their lips but their heart be far from me in vain do they worship me it's a way of living but not a way of life a denominational spirit will cause it conforming to biblical teachings Paul is a perfect example of that yes he was a Pharisee lived a life blameless even our Prophet himself became a missionary baptist and was doing everything that he knew concerning the word of God until one day in Mishawaka I think it was and a little meeting is going on with the sign Jesus saves and he said I stopped in there and he said oh my there was people shouting and they looked like they enjoyed what they had I think you know what people judge us by the way we act if you're not happy about what you got you ain't going to sell it to nobody amen come on if you bit into something and you started eating and then you and your face grimaced and and you oh good you want some are you kidding me do I look like a fool I was born at night but not last night yeah I tell you what Christians should people should be able to see that there is something different about you not because of the way you dress because the way you dress is only a manifestation of what God has already done in your heart Jesus said if you love me amen if you love me keep my Commandments amen say that to a mega church where's the Holiness where's the justification where's the sanctification where is it well we don't have to do that you know it's all by grace and you make it nothing but disgrace see what I'm saying well why why then do you live the type of life you live because I'm in love you know love does something to you yeah love makes you go nuts does brother Brenham talks about uh infatuated he said yeah he say you see a young boy and he finds a young girl and the two that go to like one another and Sparks Fly and they get infatuated that's why even when I I I tell our young people here I said until you're engaged until you're engaged you don't get to sit next to that girl you're interested in why I'll give you a quote brother brm said my girlfriend invited me to church and he says you know what oh you know he talks it neck like a swan and oh she was such a beautiful girl he says you invited me to church I sat next to her and guess what I looked at her the whole time while he's preaching never heard a word of what he said distractions sure amen amen that's why we why that's why we teach these things amen thank you Lord Paul was identifying the characteristics of life that he was living now in the flesh for his revelation of the word is now manifested in the way that he lives his life in Galatians 2 and 20 amen nevertheless I live he says I am crucified with Christ I want to ask you how often does a Christian need to crucify his flesh daily basis some of you a 100 times in that daily basis because it depends on how strong or which dog you're feeding the most right I have a quandry in my house right now I do I have a white SCH snower and a black schneer brother Ram says which dog are you going to feed so I let Becky feed the black dog I feed the white dog anyway no I feed them [Laughter] both but I just want to ask you the spirit that you feed your your soul on is identified by characteristics around you let me give you an example brother brandom said you claim to be a Christian let me go into your home let me listen to the music you listen to let me read the books you read let me look at the pictures that you look at and I'll tell you whether or not you're a Christian why a Christian identifies himself with the things and the characteristics of God somebody say Amen it does it identifies itself in the word I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live thank you Lord yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me why do I live this life I'm in love yes amen I fell in love with Jesus Christ at 18 years of age do I make mistakes sure all the time will I make more but you know what I'm in love amen thank you Lord and love compels me to do the life and to live the kind of life and I love it I want to say I love it I do not beg grudged putting on pants every day in hot Phoenix I mean I go everywhere and all the guys that they got all the men they got well they're not really men they're male and they got their shorts on everywhere you go right they look at you you're so Str man it's hot don't you real yeah I know it's hot but what causes you to live the life you live is it a is it a conforming well our religion teaches us well then you you're you're no different than than the the amage maybe we'll start selling the little flat hats here with a little flat top on it and we'll all have to grow a beard half of you are growing beards right now anyway we're not far from that I'm not against beards in fact the first time I ever grew a beard and Flagstaff church when I grew it and come to church everybody hey look at that look what are you trying to do you know and man I I got so upset you know what I did I marched right back to my pastor I tell you what you know what Brother Floyd those guys making fun of me on growing a beard he said if you're man enough to grow up take the the razin that goes with it get out of my office yeah you w't grow a beard go it it's funny yeah everybody's got to try all the boys I should say got to try that now we find that in the midst of the anointed ones in the end time we thank God for the message of the hour because it begins to discern spirits and what's happening among us otherwise we'd be all confused right and did you know that John the Baptist they came to him and asked him are you the Christ now the scripture says in Luke 3 because I I want to parallel this because it's important because we can see as it was so will it be Luke 3: 15-1 17 and as the people were in expectation and all men used in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not and John answered saying to them I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I'm not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire now remember John's anointing was to get them to believe and baptize them unto repentance with water but there's a far greater one amen that John's talking about and the one that comes after me his baptism what baptism is it fire what is it holy ghost amen whose fan in his is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his Garner but the CHF will burn he will burn with fire unquenchable now brother brenon picks this up in the seven Church AE book page 328 and I want to W make one more comparison between the ludia and Prophet messenger and John the prophet messenger who pre preceded Jesus's first coming the people in John's day mistook him for the Messiah John 1:1 19 and 20 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ now this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus there will be a spirit in the world at that at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this right in fact brother Brenham when they started praying in his name and baptizing in his name he said I'm quitting the ministry and then the Lord had to show him this must come to pass because it's going to be a type as it was in the days of John and he said then later he says then I found out if it didn't happen I would have to repent of my Ministry so now we see we see a type of John and a type of this end time Prophet that there'll be a spirit that will seduce some and cause them to believe it amen if you've ever met them you will see they will tell you brother Brenham was the son of man brother Brenham was Christ in the flesh and they will go on and on and they'll say all kinds of things and they're so very very close to the real truth come on that is true in fact let me say this not to throw you off but I believe that some of them have got a closer Revelation than some of us who just call him Prophet amen because you got to recognize the messenger now the messenger is not William brandom that's right come on don't get your eyes on the man that's right it's the voice behind the voice that's right who do you say I am do you believe me to be God's Prophet oh excuse me I see that kind of stumbled you oh excuse me he says do you believe me to be his servant yes yes do you believe that what I'm telling you is the truth yes yes and then he begins to now bring the word of the Lord you see what I'm saying but they had to believe it they had to believe what what is the theme song of every message church only Bel do you know only believe is Anointed in every language in all the countries around the world I don't care if it's French German Italian doesn't matter only believe that's why it has such an anointing to it if because the angel of the Lord told him as Moses was given two signs I'm going to give you two signs because Moses said they're not going to believe me who shall I tell them sent me tell them the I am sent you but because Moses you say you need some sign I'll give you two signs a sign in the hand and then put your sand or hand here and it comes out leprosy right and gave Musta those would be two signs and and he says but they'll believe the sign after what is the sign that comes after those signs there's a voice and the voice is the sign and that's the one that you and I caught because I'll tell you what let me just say this I was in a church up in Canada when the men that made the the thing believe the sign you have all seen that believe the sign and I was in the office there and so they turned it on for me in the computer believe the sign all this in 20 30 minutes later well brother Ron what do you what do you think I said I want to ask you a question which one of those signs made you a believer I'm going to ask all of you right now of the Vindicated signs whether was it the cloud was it the Halo picture was it the pillar of fire sitting on his shoulder was what what were the signs was it all of the Miracles was it the raising of the Dead come on I want to ask you which sign when you saw it you said voila now I believe I said I'll tell you what you may think I'm crazy take away every sign take away every picture take away all the healing the reason I believe this message because there was a voice behind the sign I Heard a Voice Within the Voice who was it it was the Lord Jesus Christ in fact there's one quote brother Bren said this is no longer the voice of William Brandon who was it God Amen God called each one of you that's why the message quickened to you yeah that's why brother Johan sister Teresa when he got that first message book brother Russell your cousin Dave up there in Canada and you said hey he was down here with his wife and I had some message books on my table he got interested started reading I want you to look him up so I did you gave me a number Semi-Pro baseball player he said up there so I called him he said oh yeah I said you're related to Russell yeah yeah I said you you you found some book yeah yeah well I'd like to invite you to church I can't come to church I play ball on Sunday okay no problem what happened it wound up that there was one time that I think season was over so he came to church and uh let me tell you what happened is Dave Dave got hooked praise the Lord hallelujah amen his Val his wife Valerie oh she was a tough [Music] nut sat like this in church you ain't going to hey h try to convince me she had a handshake that would make most of you men easy she put huh Russell vice grip and the Holy Spirit told me that I couldn't leave Canada one of the last things is Valerie's got to come in oh my goodness listen this going to take ages oh Rock of Ages thank you Lord yeah one day in church man let me tell you that Spirit broke she gave her heart to the Lord Jesus baptized her praise the Lord God gets his seed every time you may be darkness of religion and all kinds of teaching and unbelief go get your husband yeah come on I don't have a husband sure yeah you've had five and the one you're living with now ain't your husband come on sir I perceive thou art a prophet amen and I've been taught that when the Messiah comes amen he will say stuff like this and Jesus says woman the man that speaketh unto thee is he what'd she do she ran she left her water pot the very things she went there to get water for but she got a different kind of water cuz he said if you would ask of me and she finally said give me this water and he gave it to her and then she ran into the City come to see a man so they came but the the the result of this is she was an attraction what caused her to to become the way she became what caused her to quit living that life she was living to be so changed they were interested so they all come but then they heard the words of Jesus himself and said we too are are convinced that the word words that he speak not because of you you just was an attraction some of you that's exactly some people like you because there's something different about you and let me say the vice versa some people hate you and they don't know nothing about you that's right come on I stand in line there at the at the bank many times and boy green hair and red hair and tattoos and piercings and stuff all over the body may I help you oh yes oh yes sir we we're happy you know listen that and I'm waiting in line what do you want excuse me yeah what do you want yeah I'd like to make it deposit okay they don't like you you'll be hated listen being a Christian you think everybody's going to be happy you're a Christian oh I'm glad welcome come in yeah one of us Jesus said if they hated me look at what they did to him they spit in his face any of you ever had someone spit in your face it's horrible yes it I had a young man I was in junior high school we got in a little bit of a confrontation he spit in my face it haunts me to this day it shocked me so yeah and you know what it shocked me so bad I let him go honestly it has bothered me that I thought if I ever see him I've never seen him since God's kept him away from me but maybe I would lead him to Jesus amen amen and I would say I forgive you for what you did after I pick him up no that's just the old carnal man wantan to come out how many of you once in a while have these little carnal thoughts you know H that brother brother Brenham in a dream had a guy up there uh he was bad mouthing brother Bren said I said P knocked him down like that and he said yeah you shouldn't talk to me like that remember the vision huh he grabbed him again knocked him down yeah I remember Billy Paul telling me that we was out to dinner and uh uh there was couple guys and they were cussing and filthy mouth and everything and brother Bram got up and he said excuse me left his family walked over and he said hey you two you two men he said you do you put that nice clean clean food in them filthy mouth that you all that I got my family over here and I got my uh children over here and this filthy mouth and stuff like this so I'm going to ask you I'm a minister of the gospel and Billy Paul thought oh man here we go we're going to this going to be it Daddy's a boxer and you know what they said excuse us right huh stand for Christ I love the fact that there's someone that has the audacity to say you know have respect I love my family and you guys are you know can you talk nicely while we have our food and then I don't care what you do outside amen amen amen I want to show you a quote that's really amazing Luke 4 verse 41 Luke 4 verse 41 and the Devils came out of many crying and saying Thou Art Christ the son of God that mean they got the Holy Ghost they were recognizing he was because the Bible says that many knees will bow and tongues confess that he is God right amen but they won't be doing it by personal revelation they'll be doing it because of the fact of the matter he is God and all of the atheists and all of these anti-religious people one day they will stand before the almighty God and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess he's God but the Bible says and they saying Thou Art the Christ the son of God and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was Christ ain't that amazing so even remember in the book of Acts Paul and the disciples were going along and a woman was going behind them for three days here these men these are men of the most high God you know what most preachers would do in the message today put it in their news magazine and put a video clip on there and send it around YouTube and let everybody see it look at that God V K my Ministry I got people coming here and they saying here these men these are men of the most high god oh what did Paul do he being vexed in the spirit finally what was it is a demon what they were saying was right just like those Devils right we know Thou Art the Christ yeah here these men they're men of the most high God come out of her Satan Spirit left her and then guess what those that made money by her divination come to him oh you've ruined our moneymaking even Devils recognize the Christ of God so don't be fooled don't be fooled by signs wonders come on how about the I think it's the sermon the name of Jesus brother Ram said you you know and I've often asked myself how did Brother Brenham get himself into situations where he saw witches and wizards drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil where in the world were you man how why were you hanging around those guys well he says how about that time he says all these people and there there came a a a tongues and interpretation there's somebody here Among Us who don't believe trying to expose him table floating in the air you remember that a table says oh it's floating several inches off the ground yeah brother brm said yeah I'm that one I don't believe this nonsense he said in the name the Holy Catholic Church tell me is this the truth tell me in the name of the father son Holy Ghost is that the truth he said now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tell me that to truth table fell down busted and everything like this yes I'm an I I'm a deceiving Spirit the Bible says try every spirit and see whether or not it's God because the spirit is identified by characteristics everything's identified by characteristics diseases are known by characteristics animals are known by their charact characteristics brother Braham says who watch a certain bird the way it flies characteristics a dove flies different than a quail amen everything is known by its [Music] characteristics amen false Spirits are known by characteristics also and when the body of Christ begins to become divid divided what kind of a spirit that divides and conquers what kind of is it nickan the body of Christ is united in one brother Bram says I have been sent to the bride of Christ that she might be United with the word and have an invisible Union with Christ amen thank you Lord amen so now that we are called message Believers the devil wants to come in and get us fighting and arguing I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos come on come on on Amen Paul said I'm glad I never even baptize any of you unless you you say I baptize you in my name my people getting all divided and everything well he's coming on a White Horse no he's coming on a white cloud and they differ all over quotes or Inspirations of what was said and the next thing you know they can't even Fellowship one with another why come on he said divide and conquer what kind of spirit is that nickan amen God help us brother Bram said Hey You can disagree with me as far as East is west but he says you know what as long as you're not coming here to this church and so in Discord you are my brother in Christ come here and amen I'm not trying to make everybody see it the way I see it I don't want everybody to be like me I tell Steve mcney and Mario and all these guys that Minister here behind this Pulpit I say you be you don't try to be a little imitation Ronnie no way you be you amen I want all of you you to be you all of you are unique big tall short pretty ugly pretty ugly did you know brother RM said that Beauty on a woman in the last day is a curse you know what happens watch this this last thing the homas I think it was what was it June 6th or something like that when the homas they come in they had the paratroopers and little airplanes and stuff and they landed and there was a concert going on you know what they did to the pretty women it's in your newspapers it's in your news huh yeah he says Beauty in the last day can become a curse and you sisters I tell you brother Rim said now be careful I want you to look nice but he says you know what don't take your beauty out of Hollywood that's right he said you take it out of the word and God watch over you amen take your modesty take it from the scriptures don't try to dress in this Hollywood fashion cuz was it not aen who said what I do in my house is my business until the Church started losing battles and Joshua went on his face before God oh God you said you'd be with us we wouldn't lose any men and I lost so many men in battle and God what's wrong and and God said get up off your face Joshua quit cry and speak there's sin in the camp God don't let sin come into our camp don't let us sit here and let Hollywood and all kinds of worldliness come in here God help us to preach the truth somebody say Amen to that sir well give me your quote on an iPad I don't have a quote on the iPad well I got lots of quotes on entertainment movies uh oh it's getting real quiet yes the word without the spirit is dead amen Revelation is when you are quickened by the Christ of God yeah amen that's what changes you yes exactly changes you from one Glory the glory of this carnal man to the glory of a spiritual man he's changing you and guess what every time you come to church Church you are Washed by the Water of the word that's why just keep coming keep coming you know what automatically any of you know what the being under the cloud is like or or you that are technically minded you know if you're under the cloud or how many bars you got on your phone can you hear me now or you got those things in your car now you just take your your cell phone and just set it on there and guess what it automatically starts charging and powering up and guess what your phones your iPads and your computers always give you a little notice and you are about to get an upgrade any of you none of you I do my crazy computer all the time getting an upgrade next thing you know I turn it on I forgot my password how no what in the world you know I'm one of these oldtimers I have to write this down I have to put it on my cell phone or something because all of a sudden I get an upgrade and they say okay what's your password uh that's been months honey call Boaz and ask him what's the password no anyway you know what I'm saying saints come on you come to church yeah you may not think that you're getting an upgrade right but you're sitting here in the presence of such a cloud of witnesses amen thank you Lord that maybe because of the guy next to you PE or at the end of the Pew or some sister's been praying and seeking the mind of God and God is like this and you're just close enough man something was happening yeah cuz you were under the influence of the cloud every time you come to church you are hearing Jesus said I have yet many things to say unto you seeing that you do not you cannot bear them now how be it right after I'm gone amen the Holy Ghost will come and bring all those words that I said unto you to your remembrance but if they ain't on your hard drive come on come on does not compute nothing there nothing on the hard drive that's why you may think well I'm not really getting something you wait cuz there'll come a time when the Holy Spirit will Quicken you and say remember that sermon you heard remember that this remember you were reading this all a wow Hallelujah that's what we depend upon the revelation of Jesus Christ is what causes you to live the life that you're living Spirits are identified by characteristics brother Bram says an identified Christ of all ages I love this sermon every one of the prophets displays displayed God's characteristics because it picked up the word for that age and identified it amen God interpreted his word of that age through the man amen now no man can find fault with that that's the scripture well if it's always been that way won't it have to be the same today if he's the same yesterday today and forever God's interpreting his own word he said this thing will happen in a certain age and this thing will happen and he comes down and does it now he don't need no interpreting to it cuz it does it itself cuz God is his own interpreter when you read through your Bible you will see that the Christ of God is always associated with these things it will always be associated with a pillar of fire it'll always be associated with being a a Son of God it'll always be associated with being a chosen of God it'll always be associated with the Messiah amen the Christ of God you follow me amen can any good thing come out of Jeffersonville Nazareth we come and see second Peter 1:2 through 21 knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost hang on here a second what time is 114 I'll try to finish is that okay yeah I'm getting older I'm a little bit slower I walk more careful than I did before as a young boy you just get out of the car man you're walking across it Warren I went to lunch with you guys said goodbye to you guys remember over there at the and I walk outside and the police were out there there was two or three police cars and their lights were on they're yeah they're only from here to Neil mon away from me and so I'm looking at this and like this and I step off the curb down I go do an endo I lay there you think the cops came over and check out on me nobody did nothing then Warren come out brother Ron brother Ron what are you doing I just laying here in the sun thought i' you he's a caregiver well let me help you up yeah I okay you know is your knee okay now I'm all right I'm right hurt my feelings more than anything else that's what happens as you get older you know brother brim said I used to have to write down all the scriptures and all that uh I didn't have to if you said nowadays I do huh how many of you chase a thought in your mind and the older you get the fur just just right there what what's that guy's name honey what no and then the both of you then you're both chasing it and then you ask somebody else until you know two hours later you're sitting there and oh yeah yeah it was John honey it was John that's what happens you get older and I found out something too you know why that is David here I'll tell you a secret cuz I got so much in my mind there's so much logged up here that that when it goes through analytical some of you don't have much up there you got it me I you still don't get it age it does it to you anyway praise the Lord amen let me go on let me go on here thank you Lord in the sermon why brother Bram says this we realize that God that logos or the pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness that was Christ that was Christ that was the anointing wow Christ the anointing yes so it's the same anointing that led the children of Israel by the pillar of fire the same Pillar of Fire met Saul on the road to Damascus what was he meeting when he met that anointing he was meeting the Christ of God who art thou Lord I'm Jesus I am the Christ of God Amen what you have found or may I say this put it you know what Found You The Christ of God Amen he was looking for you thank you Lord that's why if you do not have that seed Gene in you no matter how much of the light of this message Shines on you it'll do nothing to you that's right but if you are elect seed and that light shines upon you let me tell you it'll be quickened and it starts to come to life thank you Lord thank you Lord amen regardless of where that seed is at and how much it's been covered over you take uh and pour concrete or put asphal and do all this stuff and guess what you're going to find little blades of grass coming up and little cracks in the in the concrete and you got you got grass gone M I got I poured concrete so I don't have to cut grass but I have to pick grass now because there's places because guess why there is an ordained seed of grass that's been laying underneath there no matter how much of an Insurgent we put there it only lasts so long and that which is ordained to life let a little bit of water a little bit of sunshine guess what you got weeds you got grass little bit of water and sunshine guess what you got elex SE hallelujah amen sir we would see Jesus 64 this is a good quote when Jesus was on Earth he said he was a Son of God they condemned him he said why would you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God Amen when you call those who the word came to Gods Abraham was considered a god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God because the word of God came to them amen now stop there just second if the word of the Lord came to them I want to ask you when this message came to you right what did it make you gods and you see when the man was anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ yes he did when Moses was anointed he portrayed Christ when David was anointed he portrayed Christ all leading up to Christ he was the fullness of the word and the Word was manifest in him he was the complete anointed one we had it by portions they had it by portions we have it by portions he was the anointed one Hallelujah the entire plan of God laid in him right each one of those written within the scriptures portray Christ of their hour what is it the word identifying itself in their lives Adam was a Son of God placed in Eden identified for Christ that age he portrayed Christ in the garden it was Christ and in him as God over Eden he was a god of the earth it was Christ in him to redeem Eve see that it was the Christ of God in him playing the part as a mediator and kinsman redeemer to take Eve to himself amen that same anointing that led the children of Israel is the same anointing that's leading this New Testament Church yes we're not following a prophet per se we're following the pillar of fire amen because the prophet Moses moved when the pillar of fire moved you follow me what's amazing is when that Pillar of Fire came it put a hedge on both sides of them yes and there was light in Goan but darkness in Egypt right think of that my brother my sister God is watching over you and your family and you apply the token to your home let me tell you the devil's afraid of that token amen that's why we as fathers of our home we have a right to apply the token to our home amen you just don't close the door to your sons and daughters rooms in your house and let them live what they want want to in your house right that's how I believe it am and if they're old enough and they disagree go ahead you're my Offspring yeah spring off cuz you can't force them to do it that's right take a television away from them and they don't want it they'll resent you for it take away their Sports take away the things okay and you force them you know what you see kids that are forced to have to go to church they are forced to believe that you know what they get a rebellious Spirit about that's right it's not because they want to be there on there there's young people like that in every church I don't care if it was brother brenham's Church brother brandham says hey look if my kids start cutting up in church these are quotes brother B say if my kids start cutting up in church and they're doing wrong the deacons have a right to take them out and he says you know what I'll correct my kids at home and he said you parents you do the same thing and if your kids can't act right in church he says then keep them home until they know that's right amen somebody say amen amen obedience who do you just say this isn't Brethren if you come we're we're closing here who do you say this is 64 the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God see the Oneness of God in the word anointed in you see then you become a messiah of the age yes then how can a man say that he's a Christian and filled with the Holy Ghost and deny that word in the that is the same yesterday today and forever holy ghost in you will punctuate that word every word amen sir amen amen amen when the word says anything you say that's true amen right because you're agreed with the word you're agreed with God you and God are one God is in you your his son and his daughter makes you a messiah for him the anointed word living out in you amen what does that make us little Messiahs little Gods minor gods do you know at the white Throne judgment there are going to be people saved who did not have a SE in them right but they were good to you they did something for you yes if just a cup of [Music] water a tank of gas buy your meal fix your tire you ever had somebody do something like that for you and what if on the day of judgment they come up there have you

oh my Lord may I speak yes you may well one time back on Earth my car broke down I had a blowout I had this that whatever and they stood for me and I tried to give them money and they said no no no [Music] just I ask you if you're a messiah when will you do the work of a messiah what do you think it's going to be like when they know they're condemned and you stand in the Gap and you become a messiah for them and say I'm going to stand for them right now and then it's erased enter in to eternal life wow you think they'll shake your hand you think they'll say thank you thank you my this word that we believe is to anoint you to live a life that you can become a messiah even to others amen help us Lord to live a life life that's worthy of the [Music] [Music] Gospel amen oh there's so much good stuff [Music] here watch [Music] this I got a couple here that I want to read to you invisible Union of the bride of Christ the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man man that's born to be a Son of God With The predestinated Germ into him for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven Martin Luther saw it it was for his saw it for his Wesley saw it for his Pentecostal saw it for his now what about you why it's been put there by predestination you are for Redeemed by a son uh to be a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world you're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory and the word of God and if the word of God was God then you were in God the word that part that you were to play was in God before the foundation of the world it's a mystery being revealed yes is that not the mystery that's been hid down Through the Ages what is it Christ in you the hope of [Music] glory Paul said my little children Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you I found this quote the other day and I've been pondering over it for quite some time what is the Holy Ghost 1959 and the same time that the nominal church was having their Revival what take taking place Full Gospel was having a Revival there come forth the Bosworth Brothers Smith Wigglesworth and Dr Price Amy mcferson all those look Smith Wigglesworth died one night Dr Price died the next morning within 24 hours I was on the field now my end is coming down you don't hear much of Billy Graham you don't hear much of Oral Roberts i s see my meetings shadowing what's the matter we're at the end another age how did Billy Sundy come in and them they come in just after the great Moody Revival when did moody come in just after knox's Revival when did Knox come in just after finny's Revival finny after Calvin Calvin after Wesley and Wesley after Luther on down through the age then come as soon as one Revival is over God raises up another and throws more light just keeps moving like that and I ask you when the prophet of God went off the scene did God go off the scene no no you know what God just changed his mask he went from one Prophet messenger into a whole bride body and now we are the mystery it's us the final voice was not Revelations 10:7 the final voice is revelation 108 take the book which is open now and eat it because thou must prophesy amen it's our duty it is our predestinated will to speak the word of God without fear or favor amen God let me live this message don't let us become so divided Amen Let us become one because there's been an invisible Union of the bride of Christ amen [Music] amen last quote here questions answers someday I'm going to leave I'm going to leave here I'm wondering what will be my end is it over is it just about I'm 48 years old wow he was thinking this when he was 48 it's just about I wonder this if it is look Why didn't the world realize that picture there he pointed to the one with a pillar of fire why didn't the world recognize that picture why didn't they catch that right quick why didn't they catch those other things why don't they catch these prophecies and things you know they can't do it now one day I'm going to leave the world and when I leave then they'll recognize it some of you young people will realize that after I'm gone see but God would wouldn't permit it to be done now but now is the time he is permitting it we're catching it thank you Lord we're catching things greater this message is becoming greater not in number but in power and demonstration amen we're not looking for the great numbers no there's there there is a purging of the church right now huh there is a purging he always does it right before he takes the elect away because the shock is not air with the weed that's why if you can be shooken and you can be let off by some false prophet or somebody that you know what it'll happen you'll find fault with this message and then you'll be like those others he'll spit in his face you'll kiss him a judian kiss and say well there was nothing to it but he's coming soon why do you think a lot of these old Warriors are passing away right now a lot of these witnesses that have been here for years telling us when we lost brother Billy Paul of all the men on the face of the Earth he saw more Miracles more signs than anyone he was a great treasure Trove as a witness you could call him you could ask him I I did that many times brother Billy what was it like what did you do when we drove in the car together I had him for hours driving to one pastor's Church to another and there I'd ask him what was it like with your daddy when you went to pick him up what was it like he said brother Ron he said I'd go to the the door he said of brother brandom's room I'd knock on the door he said Billy if I don't come to the door it's because I'm praying and I will not interrupt my prayer to answer the door he said you wait five minutes he said and if I don't answer then you wait another 5 minutes and he says and Billy when I come to the [Music] door he said if I don't talk to you you don't talk to me he said why cuz I've been waiting on God and I've got a word for to the church and I want to be distracted that's why those deacons and stuff when brother renam had come to church and there was thousands of people there you know what they had deacons that would get on each side of you and take him from his car to his office they protected him because he said I got a I've got a word for the church he didn't want to be distracted amen but these the old Warriors are going off and now I go to meetings what's amazing I go to meetings and I become one of the oldest of the
