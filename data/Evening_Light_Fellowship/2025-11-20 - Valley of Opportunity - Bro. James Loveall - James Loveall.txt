As we turn the service over to our brother James, if we could just sing that song, pour your spirit out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just want more of him. &gt;&gt; Want him to speak to each and every one of us tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, pour your spirit out on me. All just like the rain. Lord, saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me and fill my cup again. Heal my heart and make me whole. Lord, I need you now for your sweet. Let's sing that verse. Oh Lord, I seek you. Just help me find you. How I need your touch. Oh mind my dry broken places. mercy for your love. Amen. And Lord, forgive me if I've wandered far away from you. You are all I ever needed. Lord, come and make me new. Oh, pour your spirit out on me. All just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall fresh on me and fill my cup again. Heal my heart and make me whole. Yes, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Let's sing it again. Oh, pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and pause on me. Fill my cup again. Lord, heal my heart and make me whole. Lord, I need you now. pour your spit out. &gt;&gt; Is that truly your desire this evening? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Just as it's been raining the last few days. &gt;&gt; Seems like the floodgates have been open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's my expectation this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the Holy Spirit would come. And just as I was sitting in the room there and the windows, I left him open today and you hear the rain falling. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All fresh on us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he is here to meet that expectation. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because his word says where two or three are gathered &gt;&gt; in my name, &gt;&gt; there I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't have time to have an expectation for tonight. But what if I WAS TO TELL you Jesus was going to come by tonight? Come on. That's right. He was going to come walk by your pew. &gt;&gt; He was going to walk the aisle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What would your expectation be? &gt;&gt; Because when I read my Bible, &gt;&gt; I read stories of the woman with the blood issue. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; She said, "If I can only &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; touch the hymn of his garment." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need to speak to him. Come on. &gt;&gt; I just want to touch him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes I become a baby in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. because I've studied and I've waited &gt;&gt; and I know you have something for your people this evening. &gt;&gt; And so, Father, would you just open the floodgates &gt;&gt; of your presence? Would you pour yourself out once again? We have come hungry. We have come thirsty. &gt;&gt; We have come with our cups, oh God. And we WANT OUR CUPS TO OVERFLOW. SO, FATHER, would you come and just break the bread of life to us this evening as we walk through your scriptures? Would you come and talk to us? &gt;&gt; Lord, we have a desire. We have a hunger. We have a longing, oh God, to know more of you. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to tell you how much we love you. because in loving you, we want to serve you, oh God. &gt;&gt; So, Father, would you come? And I'm sure there's needs across this building and those streaming. And Lord, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And &gt;&gt; your presence is here. And you promised in your word. And so, we're going to take you at your word this evening. Come open our eyes of understanding. Give us revelation. Give us anointing. Oh God, I set aside myself. And &gt;&gt; Lord, come. &gt;&gt; Speak to us once again. &gt;&gt; We love you and we'll be sure to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory. For you are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him this evening. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he's a good God. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to the scripture there. Thank you, musicians to Second Kings chapter 3 and we'll go to Ezekiel 37 and Psalms 23. And we'll be coming back to these portions of scripture. So hold your places here in 2 Kings 3 and 16. And it said, and he says, "And he said, thus sayeth the Lord, make this valley full of ditches." In Ezekiel 37, turn over to Ezekiel 37. The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about. And behold, there was very many in the open valley. And lo, they were very dry. &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, Oh Lord, thou knowest. And again he said unto me, prophesy unto these bones &gt;&gt; and say unto them, &gt;&gt; oh we dry bones. Hear the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Psalms 23. If you're there, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Let's just read this together. Psalms 23 and verse one. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. waters through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil. Surely goodness and mercy follow me all days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; And everybody said &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; So this evening I would like to just for a moment talk on the valley of opportunity. Valley of opportunity with the subject of do you live? Now we see here that David is painting two different pictures and I had put here in the the they had put here in the slideshow. I gave him some pictures. Do we have those that we can see here that David is pointing to two two different pictures here. He says, and he begins to talk about green pastures. And in green pastures, we know and it symbolizes a peacefulness, an abundance, a security, a protection of a shepherd, the rest, and the safety, the plentifulness of his blessings in our lives, overabundance of rain and green that in those green pastures. And he says, "He lays me beside the steer waters, which is the river of life. And there's comfort, there's safety there." &gt;&gt; And I, as I was thinking about over in New Zealand, there's more sheep than people. And you see the vastness of all the greenery over there and all these fat sheep that just sit there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They have nothing to worry about. &gt;&gt; Beet down in that valley, they have nothing just to worry. and there's a shepherd that's looking over him. And then we see that he's talking about the valley of the shadow of death through the trials and the sickness and the hard times that we may face and dry seasons and uncertainty and unsure, &gt;&gt; a valley that's unclear, but yet it's just a shadow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's something greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something greater. Listen to what the prophet said. He says, "So many make a terrible mistake on this one scripture and that is in Psalms 23. They read it like this. Yay, though I walk through the dark valley of the shadow of death." Now, there's no such thing. The Bible doesn't say it. The dark valley or the dark valley of the shadow of death. Says, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death." Now, before it can be a shadow, it has to have a light to make that shadow. See, David being a prophet and under an anointing, he didn't make a mistake. &gt;&gt; He just said the truth. Yay. Though not I walk through a dark valley, but through the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; He says, then you have to have a certain percent of light to make a shadow. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is here. We are both natural and supernatural. This body is subject to death and was brought forth by a woman, not by nothing but through, not by God. You're a reproduction from Adam and Eve. Be black, white, whatever you are, you are reproduced. He says, an offspring of Adam and Eve. He says that makes your body born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the world, speaking lies, you were damned and condemned at the beginning of your life, not even without a chance. not even without a chance. But yet it's just the shadow because he says to a believer there's no such thing as death because there's a greater life. &gt;&gt; And when you step into that light, it becomes JUST A SHADOW BECAUSE DEATH HAS NO HOLD on the believer. But what it is is you begin to step from this life to the other life. &gt;&gt; That's why he can say I have no fear &gt;&gt; of the valley of the shadow. So we walk through valleys. Valleys are a part of our Christian walk, a part of our Christian journeys. And we have mountaintop experiences. And yet we find as we go through life and the older we get, you find that there's more valleys than there is mountain peaks. There's more valley times that we spend &gt;&gt; because it is in the valley is where you are proven. &gt;&gt; It is in the valley where your fruits begin to grow. It is in the valley where you begin TO PRAY AND YOU'LL find yourself down on your knees a lot more when you're in the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is in the valley that you pray yourself through because at the end of the valley you see the next mountain that you might peak that you might crest and you desire to reach that mountaintop and so you gaze up there. What is it your prayers are pushing you through? It is in the valley where you strive, you persevere. &gt;&gt; But I can testify this evening that the same God on the mountain is the same God in the valley. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It don't matter to a believer if you're down in the valley or up on the mountain. The God that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He's still the one leading you. He's still the one guiding you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So as I begin to think that if we can understand valleys then we can understand what God is trying to do and the opportunities he has in those valleys. &gt;&gt; Valleys of opportunity. They're not low points in our lives or trials or hard times, dry seasons, but opportunities that God is trying to show us. And he's trying to bring forth something in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Nature shows us that there's all kinds of different valleys. And to save time, I was going to put some pictures, but to save time, nature shows us that you have a valley that is formed, and it's a V valley, and it's formed through streams and rivers, something small. And then you have a U valley that can be formed over time from what a collacure would have come through and knocked out a whole entire mountain and caused another valley. You have wide valleys that a big river would run through and all these valleys are formed in different ways and over different time frames. If you could pull up the two pictures. So I had just looked up two different valleys. I Google imaged what is a beautiful valley and all these valleys pulled up of Switzerland in between and you see that it's green and it's lush and then you have a desert valley and as I begin to look at these two different pictures and outside of the obvious that one is green and it has life and then you have one that is scarce. One lacks water, one has water. But what stood out to me between these two pictures and God began to deal with me was the distance between the mountains. Look how narrow the green valleys are. That we have green valleys in our lives and God gets us there and that's where we grow and that's where we're maturing. But yet when we go through a desert valley, when we go through a hard trial, it seems like that mountaintop is so far away. &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S WAY off in the distance. &gt;&gt; Yet God doesn't keep his people on the mountaintops, nor does he keep them just in green pastures. But he puts them in desert valleys to find the character of his sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sends us through valleys to see what we're made of. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say that he would even send a church through a desert place to find out the response of the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would send a church through a desert place. Why? Because whenever water doesn't happen, and we'll get some quotes that when water doesn't come down, what happens in a desert? You guys are desert people. &gt;&gt; Everything's spooky. &gt;&gt; Everything has thorns. Why? &gt;&gt; Because it has no water. It has no moisture. &gt;&gt; He says that is how a church can get in a condition. &gt;&gt; That I want to send them to see what they're made of. &gt;&gt; I want to see the character of the people. You watch a a church will go through a desert place and they'll find themselves and then you start getting hearing the people talk. You'll find out what those people are made of. &gt;&gt; They begin to jump from church to church. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE trying to hit the mountaintop of every single church. &gt;&gt; They're trying to avoid the valleys in their lives where God wants them to grow, where God wants them to mature. He says here and how the angel came to me. He says, "You notice another thing about nature and wherever you find it out in the desert of Arizona and around you find that there's a group." He said, "Everything out there where there's no rain, it always got a sticker on it. Every weed you get a hold of it has a sticker on it." Well, you take them weeds and you come here where they got a lot of rain and it doesn't have any sticker on it. That's a good lesson. &gt;&gt; He says, "See, if a church is all dry, no spirit in it, then they get all these little stickers boosting around." He says, "You need a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost rain, DON'T YOU? THAT'LL soften you up." &gt;&gt; He says, "And the church can't do it hurt yourself. It takes God to do it with you." &gt;&gt; God can't do it without you, and you can't do it without God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like it. &gt;&gt; That's why it's not something that you can work up, you can manufacture because sometimes God wants to send you through a desert place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And then Jesus called." He says, "Maybe some said the church has been a little kind of dry for a while. We've had an we haven't had any fresh water for a few months. We haven't had a revival. Looks like everybody's so stagnant and some or something or another. Just go to church and sing a hymn and hear a few messages and go. It's a dry season for the church. We become so stagnant and complacent. We become content. He says, "But all of a sudden &gt;&gt; that when we begin to get dry, then Jesus comes on the scene." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He freshens us up. He brings something new to us. He is always there to do that. A new hope comes when Jesus comes in. His presence brings a new hope. &gt;&gt; His presence brings a new hope. Why? Because when Jesus comes around, things happen. When Jesus comes around, atmospheres change, temperatures change, the the whole everything begins to change. &gt;&gt; Begins to soften up a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brings that rain to soften our hearts and soften our attitudes because we become more stagnant than stirred. &gt;&gt; We become MORE COMPLACENT. HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE THE Lake Michigan and how that the water and he said the the the the water was having a revival. WHAT IT WAS IT? IT WAS GETTING THE TRASH OUT OF ITS LIFE. &gt;&gt; CORRECT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO NEW WATER needed to be added to that. &gt;&gt; It had exactly what it needed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It just needed to be stirred up a little bit. But yet on the other hand, some desert places that we go through, we go through desert valleys and it's because of decisions that we make, choices that we choose. Right. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Second Kings chapter 3. 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 6. And the king Jehoram went out from Samaria at the same time and numbered of all Israel. And he went and set Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, the king of Moab has rebelled against me. Wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle to battle? And he said, I will go. I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. So these two kings, he comes to him. He says, will you go to battle with me? &gt;&gt; And these two kings are the same people. They c they're they're the people of Israel and they're going out. So they have the same God and they're going against an enemy, the same enemy. And they said, "We'll come together, but watch because brother Brandham says in the valley full of ditches," he says Jorum, he says, was a borderline believer. &gt;&gt; He says he was a little lukewarm. He says he would listen to the people and he would begin to lower the standard &gt;&gt; and influences begin to creep in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then he knew that he can go to Jehoshaphat was a righteous man. And he says, "I want to take that man over to battle with me because he's a righteous man." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say, "Watch who your company is. &gt;&gt; Watch the man who's leading you. Watch where this brother's taking you. Don't give your ear to anybody. &gt;&gt; That's good advice. &gt;&gt; You begin to listen to voices and here and there and different things. Be careful. &gt;&gt; Amen. be careful where they want to lead you. &gt;&gt; But Jehoshaphat was a righteous man and he held the standard. He believed in God. He knew God's word. And verse eight says and he said, "What? Which way shall we go?" And he answered, "The way through the wilderness of Edom." Pull up that picture of Edom. And I just began to think that this man began to say, "I I want to take you to battle. I want to take you to a place. I need you to go with me." But yet he wanted to go into a dry desert place with no water, no provisions. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They were going to fight the same enemy. THEY WERE GOING TO GO STOMP ON DEVILS. THEY WERE GOING TO GO BEAT THEM. &gt;&gt; But yet there was no water. They begin to counsel amongst themselves and left God out of the equation. &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote. And they went seven days in the wilderness and never fetched the compass. He says, "And it came, come to find out they got in trouble. They went out without counseling God and all the water supply was cut off." That's what the matter with the church. SHE SAYS THE WATER SUPPLY IS CUT OFF. Trying to carry the church without the supernatural and trying to carry the church on just the natural. Trying to pattern after other churches of the world. That's the reason we're not having the blessings we used to have. Why? Because we're trying to compare one with another. We're trying to go out there. &gt;&gt; Instead of following the leadership of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Be careful with men that say, "LET'S GO DUMP ON DEVILS." YOU CAN GO STOMP on those devils, but make sure he HAS A WAY OF WATER TO PROVIDE for you &gt;&gt; because Jehoshaphat, he knew that whenever they got in this position that in verse 9, and so the kings of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they fetched the compass is seven days journey. Watch this. Seven days journey and a compass of seven days. I didn't know what fetched a compass means. I I didn't know. So, I looked it up. It's a long circular journey of seven days. And there was no water for the host or the cattle to follow them. And so, we see they got put in this position. But yet Jehoshaphat knew. He knew that God has his ways. AND HE SAYS, "IS there not a prophet in the land? IS THERE NOT A PROPHET that we can inquire? Is there not a man that knows?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they went and fetched Elisha. And they came unto Elisha. AND ELISHA SAID, "WHAT? WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING to me?" He says, "Why don't you go TO YOUR PROPHETS OF YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER?" after they went into idolatry, after they left the message, after they left it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you go and ask them for help? &gt;&gt; Why don't you ask them to provide for you? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; But Jehoshaphat knew he was a righteous man. &gt;&gt; He knew his Bible. He knew that God had promised them a victory over the Moabites. He knew that they had victory over all of all those enemies. Right. &gt;&gt; And he said, "God didn't call us three kings together just to go, but he he called us together to go and defeat the Moabites." And so Elisha gave him something to do. &gt;&gt; He says, "You need water." Let's read verse 16. And he said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, make this valley full of ditches. For thus sayaith the Lord, ye shall not see rain, nor ye shall or see wind, nor you see rain. Yet that valley should be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast." You see, this is a valley that God seen these these men, they put themselves in this position. But what did he do? He he looked at it as a valley of opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, "You might be without water, but this is a valley of opportunity that might work through you guys that I might get you to understand that you might not see wind. You might not see rain." What is that? EVIDENCE OF GOD COMING. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT, but you better start digging because WHEN YOU START DIGGING, GOD WILL FILL THOSE DITCHES. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE DITCHES YOU HAVE, THE MORE WATER'S GOING TO BE THERE. THAT'S &gt;&gt; SO WE NEED TO start digging ditches &gt;&gt; because when we did dig the ditches, let me say God will provide the water. &gt;&gt; God isn't going to start bringing the or the water until we start digging the ditches. &gt;&gt; And the problem WITH IT IS SOMETIMES WE GET TOO COMFORTABLE. WE GET COMPLACENT. AND WHAT IS IT? OUR DITCHES are too shallow. Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been digging a ditch way too long. &gt;&gt; Or maybe you DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO dig a ditch. &gt;&gt; I've seen young men work today and they don't even know what a shovel is. They might know what a shovel is. They don't know how to get behind a shovel. &gt;&gt; Young men, we need to learn how to dig a ditch. I'm not talking naturally. &gt;&gt; I'm talking spiritually. &gt;&gt; Start digging deeper in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Start digging deeper in this message. &gt;&gt; If your VALLEY IS GETTING DRY, START DIGGING DITCHES. &gt;&gt; Because when we begin to dig, IT'S ON US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And God will provide the rest. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't I don't see it coming." Well, you don't have to see it coming. You don't have to feel it coming. But whenever you're digging, LET ME TELL YOU, GOD IS ALREADY BRINGING THE ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYER. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Why? Because in 18 he says, "And this is a light thing." Somebody say, "A light thing." &gt;&gt; This is a light thing unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he will deliver the Moabites also into your hands. And ye shall not smite you sh you you shall smite every f city and every choice city and shall and shall fail every good tree and stop every well and mar every good piece of land with stone and it shall come to pass in the morning. Listen, it shall come to pass in the morning that when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of Edom and the country was filled with water. So, not only do we got to dig a ditch, not only do we got to prepare for water, but we got to offer a meat offering unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "What is a meat offering?" IT IS NOT A BLOODY SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; A meat offering, the primary components are fine flour and olive oil and frankincense. The Hebrew word meal is Milka, meaning a gift. It has reference to any gift presented to God. Here it is a reference to the Israelites presenting this meal offering in thanksgiving for God's love and goodness bestowed upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; gratitude &gt;&gt; and thankfulness. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what he's telling us to do? Not only do you got to dig ditches, but you got to start thanking God and offer your meat offering unto him way before he even brings it to you. &gt;&gt; START THANKING HIM FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YOU. START THANKING him for your healing. If you're GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME, start thanking him. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB, START THANKING HIM AND PRAISING HIM AND SAY, "GOD, YOU ARE GOING TO PROVIDE." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to be thankful of his love and his goodness. START RECIPROCATING THAT SAME LOVE BACK TO HIM BEFORE HE EVER GIVES YOU A BLESSING. &gt;&gt; You start thanking him. You start praising him. Let me tell you, he said he'll pour out more than we could ever handle, more than we had ever desired. &gt;&gt; That's true. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, as I begin to think about this, that if we bring it to our day, even as we watch God all down through time, what has he been doing? He fetched the compass of seven church ages that he would go round about and he's going to bring it back to the very beginning once again. &gt;&gt; He's going to take us out and HE'S GOING TO GO AND HE'S GOING TO SOJIER AND HE'S GOING TO SEND HIS PEOPLE THROUGH MOUNTAIN TOPS AND THROUGH VALLEYS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But yet he said I in the water &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; we need to draw from the fountain saints &gt;&gt; that never runs dry. &gt;&gt; That all through seven church ages and it seems so dark and it seems so dry and it seemed like the people put themselves in a position but yet God looks at it as a valley of opportunity to show forth himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. See the prophet, not even the prophets were exempt from valleys in their time. Well, notice here that if we turn over to Ezekiel, that isn't amongst the valleys, that he begins to deal with the prophet there. And he begins to show us that he would show his prophets things beforehand. He would show them the very end of things that are to be. He would show them the the end goal, the end the end of it all. to give him a hope, to give him a an a desire, not only a desire for and and a love for the people, but he WOULD SHOW HIM THAT TO ENCOURAGE THEM. And he would show him that before he showed them the condition of the people. Let's turn to Ezekiel 36. And that's why the the prophet would go behind the curtain of time and God would begin to show him his converts. He would show them that these are the ones that have made it over because of your ministry. Why? Because it gave him an encouragement. He would say, "IT'S ALL WORTH IT." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Whenever you labor and you struggle and YOU GO THROUGH DARK VALLEYS AND HARD VALLEYS AND DRY places in Ezekiel 36 and he says, "For I bring I will take from among you the heathens and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your land. And then will I sprinkle water clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your idols will I clean you." Amen. &gt;&gt; A new heart will I give you. A new spirit will I put in you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh. And I will give you a heart of flesh. &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes. And ye shall keep my judgments and do them. &gt;&gt; And ye shall walk in the land that I gave your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. That's &gt;&gt; it. That's &gt;&gt; Now listen in verse 33. He says, "Thus sayaith the Lord, in the day that I shall have cleansed you, cleansed you from from all your iniquities. I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and in the waste shall be built it up shall be builded, and the desolate land shall be tilled. Whereas I lay desolate in the sight of all that pass by." And they said, "This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and inhabited." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the heathen that is left round about you shall know that I the Lord built the ruins and planted in the desolate. I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it. &gt;&gt; I will do it. What is he doing on all these seven church ages? is a compass of seven. He's taking us back to the Garden of Eden and they are going to be the ones that testify this is like the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so we come to this portion here in chapter 37 that I wanted to get to. And verse one says, "The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord. And he set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about. And behold, there was very many in the open valley. And lo, it was very dry. So we have no life, death, total destruction. There's nothing." It seems like a situation that is impossible. In Romans 6:23 says the wages of sin is what? &gt;&gt; Death. &gt;&gt; That a people can get at this place because they draw themselves from God. Because they walk away. You see ones that walk away FROM THE MESSAGE. THEY WALK AWAY FROM CHRIST. What happens? Their lives become ruined. Their everything falls apart. &gt;&gt; That's true. People out there are w searching for something. They're looking for life, &gt;&gt; but yet they don't have a purpose. They don't have nothing. And they walk through life, but yet the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet God looked at this valley, not of a valley of impossible, not a valley of man, there's all these people and I I've I've catered to them and I love them and they're my CHOSEN PEOPLE AND I BROUGHT THEM HERE AND THERE'S the condition that they're in. SO, PROPHET, WHAT I WANT YOU TO do is I want you to go down. I'm going to put you in this valley of dry bones. Show me the picture. And you see these bones are all scattered throughout the valley. And it seems like all hope is lost. &gt;&gt; But yet God looked at it as a valley of opportunity. He didn't say, "Prophet, I want you know what? The people put them in themselves in this condition. You know what? I'm going to go raise up a whole another group. I'm going to get rid of them and I'M GOING TO THROW THE CLAY AWAY." BUT GUESS WHAT? GOD DIDN'T THROW THE CLAY AWAY. &gt;&gt; He didn't throw these people off and SAID, "OH, I'LL JUST START OVER." &gt;&gt; But he looked at these bones and he said, "Sir, Ezekiel, can these bones live? And with our own carnal reasoning, you look at that VALLEY THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE, FULL OF DRY BONES, and you would say, "Sir, there's no way, God." &gt;&gt; But what did he tell him to do? HE SAID, "PROPHESY TO THESE BONES. NOT LAY HANDS. NOT JUST GO AND GATHER THEM UP AND TRY TO PIECE THEM TOGETHER, BUT I WANT YOU TO PROPHESY. WHAT IS PROPHESYING? IT IS SPEAKING THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise his name. Praise his name. &gt;&gt; And because these bones are a part of the word, they have to respond. &gt;&gt; They had to respond TO THE THE WORD THAT WAS spoken for their day. &gt;&gt; That if they didn't resurrect, they weren't a part of God. Right? &gt;&gt; Only those that are A PART OF GOD, WHENEVER HIS WORD goes forth, YOU BEGIN TO RESPOND TO THE WORD. THAT'S WHY YOU COME ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THAT'S WHY YOU COME TO SERVICE BECAUSE THE WORD IS BEING SPOKEN AND THE WORD is life. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it might be a valley of impossible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But yet his word brings life. I'm so thankful he didn't come. God didn't look at that valley and just say, "I'll start over." &gt;&gt; Do you know why he couldn't start over? Because those bones were a part of him. &gt;&gt; Those are God's chosen people, a covenant people. And he says though they get in that conditional &gt;&gt; and God always sends a prophet. &gt;&gt; Why do you think we need a prophet in this day? &gt;&gt; Because it's not the words of a man. It's not the words of just a prophet. But what you're responding to is the voice behind the voice. &gt;&gt; I want you to speak the word of God. It's not my words this evening. It's not the quotes OF A PROPHET, BUT IT'S THE WORDS OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That whenever they're preached, &gt;&gt; that when it's preached, it falls on your lot to respond to the word of God. &gt;&gt; He didn't throw away that which he began. But he says, "I'm going to revive that which I already have. I'm going to revive those people and bring them forth with my own words, and I'm going to bring life back into them. Prophesy the word of God that they may live." You may think that you're too far gone. You may think that you you've sinned your way day AWAY YOUR GRACE. YOU MAY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST A PILE of dead bones. But let me tell you, when the word of God begins to ministered unto you and you respond to the word, &gt;&gt; you might be an archaeological dig. Some of you have been maybe laying around for a long time. &gt;&gt; Maybe you JUST BEEN COMING TO CHURCH AND YOU'VE BEEN SITTING AND YOU'RE NOT RESPONDING. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN GOD BEGINS TO ALL HE HAS TO DO, HE DOESN'T need no hammer and a chisel and he's got to be careful. Well, you know what he does, Malachi? He speaks his word. And whenever the word begins to go forth, YOU BEGIN TO RESPOND TO IT. &gt;&gt; IT begins to bring forth life. IT BEGINS TO BRING FORTH THIS SENU THAT COMES OUT. &gt;&gt; THE BONES BEGIN TO GATHER THEMSELVES TOGETHER. WHY? Because there's something happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you might be in archeological dig, &gt;&gt; but let me tell you this evening. &gt;&gt; God's in the digging business. &gt;&gt; God is in the digging business. It don't matter how dead how long you've been dead. It don't don't matter HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN down there. LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU'RE A SON OF GOD, IF YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU WILL COME TO him &gt;&gt; and he will revive you WITH HIS WORD. IT'S NOT SOME WORKED UP EMOTION. IT'S NOT COMING AND YOU GOT TO DANCE AND YOU GOT TO DO THIS. NO, IT'S HEARING THE WORD OF GOD AND THEN YOU RESPOND BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; That's what's reviving you. &gt;&gt; Verse seven. So I prophesied I was commanded and as I prophesied there was there was a noise. Listen, there was a noise and behold the shaking. And the bones came together bone to bone. In a body there's 20 what? Six bones. How did what bone know where to go? &gt;&gt; A valley full of bones. &gt;&gt; And they begin to come together. And when I behold, lo the sin who and the flesh come upon them and the skin covered them above. But there was no breath in them. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO LIFE in them. Listen, you can come to church AND YOU CAN BE PUT TOGETHER AND you can walk IN AND STILL NOT HAVE LIFE. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BREATHING, just because you HAVE BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS, DOESN'T MEAN THAT you're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you're alive. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He says in the restoration of the bride tree he said the four killers took it. &gt;&gt; Four messengers destroyed it. Four messengers of death took it among away and dog's four messengers of righteousness restored her back again. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said pro prophecy prophesy son of man can these bones live? He said what's the four stages of the coming forth of that church? He says, "Watch the four stages of Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth." But the life only come not when the sineu's skins was upon him. What is that? Its muscles and tendons begin to attach them one to other. Not when that happened, but when the wind blowed upon him. That's when come back that fourth message of life. I will restore, sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise be to God. The fourth light is come that will bring forth the same signs. Watch. He says justification brought forth forth the pulp. He says sanctification brought forth the bark. Doctrine of holiness. He says what brought forth the leaf? Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; What is it? Pentecostals leaves clapping their hands and JOY AND REJOICING. PENTECOST. WHAT? BUT HE says the fourth was the word itself. The word made flesh, fruits of fruits of proof of the resurrection, signs that Christ has finally after justification been planted and sanctification been planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost, organations died out, Christ has be center himself like that that cap of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. &gt;&gt; What is it the word itself is bringing forth? Amen. &gt;&gt; First the bones, the rattling, the coming together, YET THERE'S NO LIFE. So you CAN JUMP AND SHOUT and you can move around, but there's still no life. &gt;&gt; The sineu can come and THE MUSINGS AND TENDONS COME AND IT'S A QUIET TIME, BUT yet there's no life. &gt;&gt; The flesh COMES AND HE COVERS you and you are a body made whole, &gt;&gt; but no life. You have no life unto in you until when? &gt;&gt; Until the wind begins to blow. &gt;&gt; When God begins to speak his word, that's what he does. He comes AND HE BREATHES LIFE INTO YOUR NOSTRILS. &gt;&gt; He begins to breathe on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the restoration again, he says Jesus said it'll be the same thing at the coming. Oh, then the evening light of Malachi 4 come a shining through the darkness. Amen. He says to bring the evening light on the predestinated word. Hallelujah. What's the fourth message to be? What's that fourth messenger? TO SHINE THE LIGHT on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EZEKIEL WASN'T POINTING THOSE BONES TO HIMSELF? HE WASN'T SAYING COME FOLLOW ME. HE WASN'T SAYING OH IF YOU COME AND DO THIS. He wasn't trying to do any of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if I'm going to follow a prophet, I'm going to follow a man that follows God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow a man that speaks the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the evening light has come shining through on the pred predestinated word. Yes, sir. And in verse 9, he said, "Then said unto me, prophesy under the wind. Prophesy son of man and say when thus saith the Lord God come forth the four winds oh breathe the breath upon these slain that they may live and so I prophesied as commanded and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what it is in an exceeding great army in a pile of bones? It doesn't look like they're an army. YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AN ARMY, BUT WHAT DOES THE PROPHET SAY? THAT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE, IT'S NOT A TIME TO JUST WAIT. NOW'S THE DAY OF RECOGNITION. NOW'S THE TIME TO IDENTIFY I AM THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Now is the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you begin to recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when you recognize who you are, you can identify yourself in the word &gt;&gt; and you become an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is what brings the life of God. &gt;&gt; We need the word to be preached without fear and without favor. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. What he did then as he's showing us through scripture, what was it in the Garden of Eden, just like Adam and Eve, the very beginning. What did God do? He took a rib. What is it? A bone &gt;&gt; out of Adam's side. And he says, "Out of this rib, I'm going to form a helpmate." And brother Brandham says, "It was just under the heart." Why? Because it's close to a man. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to take that rib and from the dust of the earth and with his bone, I'm going to begin to form." Why? Because Eve was a byproduct of Adam. But what God did is he began to he would take it from the original CREATION AND HE WOULD SET IT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND BEGIN TO FORM. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF HIM. from the dust of the earth and rib of the original creation. Why? Then Adam can say she is bone of my bone. She is flesh in my flesh. &gt;&gt; She is me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's a part of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet Eve laid lifeless. When she was created and formed there, I can see in the garden, she just laid lifeless &gt;&gt; and God was just working and forming &gt;&gt; and he put her together and he brought the bones together and the sineu and he put the flesh over her. Brother Brandham says she was the most beautiful woman. &gt;&gt; Yes. And she's laying there lifeless. &gt;&gt; But yet it took what? &gt;&gt; The wind and the breath of God &gt;&gt; to breathe the breath of life into Eve. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery. He says, "Now you see a secret. What to the fallen? to restore a fallen Eve as she was a prefigure of the church. And now notice as God opened up the sight of Adam and took Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided the spirit of masculine and feminine and feminist and put in Eve and took a rib from under his side and made Eve out of it. So God did the same thing, taking it out of the sight of of Christ, the blood and water. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word and the and the taking the word and making it his church Eve see back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was that come from his body. You see now he said what happened in a prefigure now he opened up Adam's side and took apart his flesh which was Adam to Eve and the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds you cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she cannot stand she has to stand on the word alone &gt;&gt; because SHE IS A PART OF IT &gt;&gt; SHE WAS TAKEN from Christ &gt;&gt; and in ORDER TO BE CHRIST, YOU HAVE TO BE CHRISTLIKE. &gt;&gt; SAYS, "LOOK, he never went and got dirt and made Eve. He made he he made from the original dirt and he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate and that was Eve. She was made for the man and a part of the man. She was a part of him in the beginning in the creation and theophony. She was a part of him down here in this creation. She could not be divided into another creation. She had to be made in the same creation. &gt;&gt; She had to be made from the same dirt. She had to be made from the same particles and the things OF THE EARTH. WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS A PART OF HIM. Just like there was TWO BY TWO ALL THROUGHOUT THAT GOD MADE MALE AND female animals, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he took Eve and he formed her. &gt;&gt; The same material. &gt;&gt; That's why I was saying in Ezekiel, he didn't go and get new dry. He didn't get no new bones. He didn't go get new dirt. What did he do? He began to gather up and revive those people, those covenant people that he already had. God never got a handful of dirt and made Eve. She had been a She would have been a different creation. She's not a creation. She's a byproduct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God goes over in the heart of Adam in the rib right out under his heart and takes a rib and makes a wife in the very part of Adam's spirit in the woman. And these two are one. Soul, body, spirit, they are one. They are perfect oneness. &gt;&gt; Oneness. &gt;&gt; You and Christ are one. &gt;&gt; I can believe in that kind of oneness. &gt;&gt; I can believe in that kind of oneness. &gt;&gt; That you and Christ &gt;&gt; are one. &gt;&gt; A real woman, a real husband, a real wife, they are one together. But is it a type of Christ from out of his bosom? Not a byproduct, not a Methodist, not a Baptist, not a Pentecostal, not some kind of church, not a denomination. No. But out of his own heart, he took a sweetheart that's pure and loyal as she can be. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to identify that I'm a part of that sweetheart. I'M A PART OF HIM. I'M A PART OF HIS VERY HEART. THAT I'M GOING TO STAY LOYAL AND I'M going to stay true. AND I'M GOING TO STAY PURE AND NOT LISTEN TO ALL THESE DENOMINATIONS AND LISTEN TO MAN THAT WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT IN THE BACKSIDE OF A DESERT SOMEPLACE. NO. BUT I WANT TO STAY LOYAL AND I WANT TO STAY TRUE TO HIM. &gt;&gt; I want to be God's helpmate &gt;&gt; for this earth. &gt;&gt; That's what you are. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; You're God's help me. &gt;&gt; He says, "Honey, will you go down here?" Sure, I'll go do that. Hey honey, WILL YOU GO PRAY FOR THAT PERSON? ABSOLUTELY. I'll go pray for that person. Hey, can you go help this person? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, you're more valuable than you think. &gt;&gt; You're more cherished than you think. You got to change your way of thinking. You got to stop thinking YOU'RE A NOBODY. YOU GOT TO STOP THINKING THAT IT ADDS NOTHING TO IT. LET ME TELL YOU. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should be in so in love with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That if there was one person going, he can say, "I'm that one." &gt;&gt; That would be &gt;&gt; That should be each one of our testimonies. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you didn't choose you. You probably wouldn't have chose yourself. But it wasn't up to you. It wasn't in your deciding. It wasn't any of that. It was in God's choosing that he predestinated. And he's seen you before the foundation of the world. Why? Because in the beginning was the word and the word was God. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're right. &gt;&gt; And if you were a part of the word in the beginning, what are we going back to? &gt;&gt; The beginning. Back to another Eden again. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. He's given us all these promises. Musicians come. He's given us all these promises and covenants. As I begin to think of the story of Ezekiel and he would show him the prophecy of things that were to be, but yet before showing him the condition of the dry bones, but yet he asked him, "Can these bones live again?" And brother Brandham came in our day and he was going THROUGH A HARD TIME AND HE would tell his story. He was coming down from Montana and they would stop in a restaurant and he would stop there and they would eat and him and Billy and they would they would eat and he would say, "Oh, that's a real man." You know, he coughed and that's a real man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; BUT YET HE WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He says the people got in such a condition. He says, "I'm just going to start preaching to them." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "The harder I preach, the worse they get." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "And they got in this condition." And he's like, I just I just won't even preach to him. &gt;&gt; And they stopped in that restaurant and they begin to leave and Billy fell asleep and they he was driving down the road &gt;&gt; and he was down in a valley. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I want you to look at those mountain rings. Give me the picture. &gt;&gt; He says, "How many peaks are there?" &gt;&gt; Said, "Seven." B R A H N. He says the first two small ones. Then he says the tall one's the first pool. Then another small one. He said the second one's the second pool. He says you're down in this one. It's going up to the third pool. And he found himself in this valley. Look at this long valley that the prophet is. But yet he said, "I want you to look at that mountaintop and that's going to be a covenant unto you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EVERLASTING COVENANT. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I'm going to keep my promise &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep my word. And if you ever GET DISCOURAGED, IF YOU'RE EVER GOING THROUGH A VALLEY, IF YOU'RE EVER FIND YOURSELF AND THE PEOPLE PUT THEMSELVES in a certain condition and you might question &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; if it's worth it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; He says, I want you to remember those mountains. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at those. Yes, &gt;&gt; because that's my covenant to you in this day. &gt;&gt; And we are covenant people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SIGN THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET IN THIS DAY and in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; THAT HE BROUGHT THE FIRST AND SECOND PULL. BUT YET, that's just that's just little stuff. &gt;&gt; But when the third pull took effect, when the word itself comes into That's it. &gt;&gt; Church, if the word doesn't revive us, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Nothing else will. &gt;&gt; Nothing else will. &gt;&gt; Nothing else will. If the word doesn't have an effect in your life, IF THE WORD THAT IS PREACHED AND IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR LIFE, NOTHING else will. &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold you in this hour. IT'S TOO DARK. IT'S TOO HARD. IT'S TOO DRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The only thing that's going to keep you is this word &gt;&gt; is this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And when YOU GO THROUGH A HARD TIME AND YOU GO THROUGH A VALLEY AND YOU GO THROUGH A SICKNESS, &gt;&gt; hold on to his word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Because his word is eternal. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if his word is eternal, &gt;&gt; so are you. &gt;&gt; So are you. &gt;&gt; So it don't matter the ups and the downs and the seasons of life. IT DON'T MA MATTER ABOUT ANY OF THAT. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you, even in you, until the end of the world." &gt;&gt; He promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of the prophet still speaks. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; the voice of the prophet, &gt;&gt; it still has an effect in our lives. &gt;&gt; So, if you're going through a valley, what did the prophet tell us in the scripture? Dig a ditch. &gt;&gt; Dig a ditch. Expect the rain to come. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because it's his word. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together. Easy &gt;&gt; when you're up on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you've got peace of mind like you've never known. But then things change when you're down in the valley. &gt;&gt; Don't lose faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't lose faith. For you're never alone. &gt;&gt; He's the same God. The God of the mountain is still God in the valley when things go wrong. Oh, he'll make them right. And the God of the good time, it's still God in the light. time. The God of the day is the God in the night. And we talk of faith. &gt;&gt; We're up on the mountain, &gt;&gt; but talk comes so easy. Isn't it easy &gt;&gt; when life at &gt;&gt; But it's down in the valleys. &gt;&gt; Down in the valley of &gt;&gt; of trials and temptation. &gt;&gt; That's where your faith &gt;&gt; That's where your faith &gt;&gt; is going to be put to the test. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. for the God on the mountain. &gt;&gt; It's the God in the valley. &gt;&gt; When things go wrong, he'll make the right.
