it's we just have to trust him amen just remember Sister Nancy as she's I believe she's on the tail end of her treatment and sister Rebecca page had her sixth treatment today I believe she's doing pretty good we're very very thankful for that um and also there's a lot of people traveling I don't I don't know who all they are I know that we are actually traveling visakis are traveling uh the yeskis are traveling we're all going to a family reunion I will be going for a couple weeks we leave this week so we covet your prayers a lot of the hours on the road and uh you know it's never an easy trip with that many children so we just we do Cove at your prayers and just pray the Lord and be with us and just use this as he sees fit amen let's sing this together now amen you see your peace if he's not your peace I pray that before the service is over that you would know God as your peace that passes all your understanding amen he is our peace [Music] there's our peace [Music] he is our

he is [Music] our heads together tonight what a privilege Lord have the peace of God that passeth all understanding and Lord in the midst of a neurotic age and age we seem ill-fitted to live in Lord we know it's completely insane the culture father but yet we can enjoy the peace of God as citizens of another kingdom this isn't our home Lord we're so grateful that you've prepared a place for us thankful for this opportunity to gather together Lord and quieten ourselves in the presence of the Lord this week Lord these needs that have been presented there are so many Lord around the world what it must be the needs amongst your children Lord but you're well able we thank you we commit them to you we think of Erica Parker there in Tennessee Lord young mother and raising children she's in her line of duty Lord this would just be an attack of the enemy we pray Lord you'd give her the faith to overcome this attack of the enemy for Rebecca page Lord we also are mindful of her and each for brother Neil and little Theo and Josiah the needs in this body Lord that are so pressing and we continually hold them before you Lord and the many others that are mentioned we ask your divine guidance Lord and presence in each one of those needs we ask thy presence with us tonight in this service thank you again for this opportunity to be together with Believers of like Precious Faith Lord we ask these things in these favors in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you want to be seated in just a moment I'll just give you this testimonies real fresh it was just last night we were driving home we'd taken the saccharine for Zachary taking Justice and Audrey out and Elizabeth for dinner but we were driving home it was 8 30. on Highway 69 there's 65 mile an hour speed limit so we're coming home on that stretch and I don't have the high beams on because there's traffic on the other side of the highway it's divided but you have your low beams on because there's cars coming on the other side there and Justice was in the back seat but I just thank the Lord he was he was watching the road he could have been dozing or doing anything but he hollered at me bad or watch out or whatever and and it was you didn't didn't even have a millisecond there was a man running down the highway right in the middle of the road right towards our vehicle so again if it if he hadn't hauler in less than a tenth of a second we'd have struck get me to kill the man so you veered really hard and he just swept by us on the passenger side there you know and so it just your nerves it just shoots your nerves you know but we turned around and went and found him he was on the shoulder then and he was drunk and he said his fiancee had kicked him out of the car or dropped him off or something he was trying to find his way here um but it just you know even if you're not at fault if you kill somebody I haven't experienced it but I'm sure it's just probably haunts you the rest of your life that kind of a thing so we're very thankful to the Lord then he spared us from that so that was just real fresh so thank the Lord he's never prison help could I just make an announcement about the schedule this weekend too so because we haven't announced the time that we want the young people up at the Rancho I'll do that but Friday night 7 30. brother James and I were just looking at the senior youth room and I've we've decided we'll be here in the sanctuary because I think we'll probably have our own Youth Of course in junior Youth and then probably 30 visitors that aren't from the assembly so I think we'll be might be too crowded in there so let's just settle it we'll have these four rows right down here right where they close the lower bowl here right in this section here so and then Zachary's real short too and I saw the platform and there's only five inches so he probably needs to be up a little bit more where people can see him so that would be in here at 7 30. and then also if the junior youth have parents that are bringing your kids join us I would say there's lots of room in the back please you know you don't have to drop them off and leave you're sure welcome to stay and also if I can have the Liberty to say that most of the young marrieds here were Zachary my son Zachary's Palace since they were little kids and uh so I think any of the young marriage that would like to come sit in on service if I have the authority I'd say you're sure welcome to come I think Zachary would be a joy for him to see you also so that's all the love all boys in Stephen Minard and just basically all the young marrieds I guess here so then Saturday morning 11 o'clock we're going to meet out at the ranch there and this is kind of a key and I don't see a bunch of our African Saints but I know you're brother you're going to get the announcement out now that it's 11 o'clock but we're going to hike from the ranch two miles to where our picnic spot is down by the creek so if if anybody shows a blade there's going to be nobody there and you're going to just be lost so of course you can call me too but ideally if you're there at 11 to follow the Entourage on our hike down to the picnic spot that would be ideal and then if you happen to get there late I would say hopefully have my number maybe we'll post it on the youth chat so that everybody has my number if they're lost so a picnic at the creek down there and then back to the ranch for the afternoon for activities and then Elizabeth's going to feed everybody also in the evening lasagna and Toscana soup and and then we'll have an open air service there after after an early dinner there at the ranch so should be all done probably by seven o'clock in the evening and I think that's all don't be late okay God bless you bless you appreciate them opening their home for the young people it's been a very blessing I got the thinking man sure wish I had that when I was growing up a pretty fun place up there just one quick announcement and I hate bringing this phone to the pulpit but I have to get this right so um for the VBS there's only 25 kids registered so far online so the children need to be signed up online not just on the bulletin board so I don't know if there was some confusion there and the deadline for the registration is this coming Sunday the 21st so just in case you signed them up on the bulletin board only they're not registered so you just please go online and also I believe Camp is still open correct for Robert so if you have not signed up for our camp and you're a

Lord is to say things to touch hearts hearts Lord be touched by the spirit of God not us Lord ourselves but may you work on our minds and hearts into things we have to do we ask you now Lord to take over the service that's our hearts give us an understanding Lord we believe and thereby we receive and we thank you now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated looks good to see each one of you out to the house of the Lord today and enjoying the good things that God has for us the desire My Heart Is you know I was looking at a lesson to preach and it was about that eagle and the thing was he just flew around and finally Mama flew by and she saw him down there and she let out a scream and he saw just looked over for a while and then all of a sudden she flew off his wingspan was about seven feet in width and but what got me and it was is that that little bird he got in there to talking to his mama and she was a little hen and the scene of it was he wanted to know how in the world that hen ever got her to begin with how many of you ever got that hen when you belong to Christ through the whole matter okay so as he asked he said well you know my brother and sisters out here they're eating out here like everything I can't stand the food and there ain't nothing here for me to eat mom she said well I don't know she said you were my hand and I had you and there he stood but he all of a sudden said but today I had a eagle stop in and made some statements upon me friends you know that might be idle statements but a lot of things in our life has ceased to be of that that it ought to be before God we talk about a Rapture talk about a resurrection talk about the powers of God and I'm not here to be critical but the more you hear about it the more you ought to act like it amen amen you're not looking for another place to spend the night you're looking for a Rapture to get out of this place and go see Jesus amen and when you look around you see a lot of your friends your hens and your the little Bobs and the girls and everybody's out there dancing having a big time out there and you're saying to yourself to the lady that I I can't understand it and I heard that eagle screamed to me today and said come on and I thought wouldn't that be a pleasure to stay to hear that same cry to you come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord amen start supplying certain things that give to life greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen and there ought to be some kind of a testament going on sometimes when I look at Sunday and I look at the people and all that's here I'm thinking how many of you people are touching God for the needs that people have within their life and within their desires and how badly we need the church on fire for God is that not the truth amen we was raised to be Eagles we was ready to be what God would have us to be and I look at myself sometimes and I wonder you know what's an eagle look like what does he act like how does he fly around about but nevertheless today that is higher my heart is to find him more real to you or I with all of the things that God has for us Amen to look towards him instead of looking towards everything else I have a scripture this morning or this afternoon I'd like to read to you and I'd like to talk to you about some of the I mean you know it's it's very difficult when you look at the scriptures and you try to find what I just told you and I went through some papers to find out years ago brother Branham spoke of that Eagle that got stirred and was called out to that place and put into action when today we talk about it and don't even move anything about it in other words that's why I thought I'm going to ask how the hen's doing they're not even feeding me how's its dudes and all these things going on you say well it's not moving I have no burdens I have no leadership I have no guidance you say why do you can I ask you that why do you want to be an overcomer because I want to go to be with Jesus amen I want to be a candidate for the things that God would have for me to be and there's no one can do that but you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen and so uh and all of the story that went on brother Branham made mention of it I looked up another scripture to read it to you this morning so it would help you it's found in Isaiah chapter 40 and beginning at verse 30 and 31. it says even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young man shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength can I say it again they that wait upon the Lord how many of you believe it pays to wait it does pay it away and we're going to talk about some of those things tonight he goes on to say here to wait that the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and they shall not faint you don't have to stagger don't have to weep don't have to cry all we are is Believers that believe the things that God would have for us amen you may be seated God bless you looking at these things this evening in being invited to minister here by brother Ron I want to say it's a pleasure to be here and to desire My Heart friends Above All Things is to see Jesus I want to know him personally I want to know him with the power of the Resurrection I want to see him alive in my life how many of you can say that Overcomers in him amen and looking at the word of God and looking at the issues and the problems that we are I've been talking to that hint about certain things all of a sudden by the grace of God I want to take the flight I want to rise up to the power of Mama eagle I want to take that soaring out of that place and I want to solve around wherever she goes I want to talk about the things that God has for us and as we talk about these things the power of those that live within us you know I think about myself I think about how God has called us to deeper depths and higher Heights with Christ amen all things are possible to them that believe greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world you believe that amen it just takes a little bit of your attention to begin to believe but as I read this and as I look at this I look at myself because I desire to be an overcomer in Christ I deserve desire to have the victory Of God through the things of my life and I've got a few of those things to mentioned to you they got a few people going to be here today I believe in one of them is going to be brother Branham I believe and one of the things he's going to talk about is a super sense how many of you could stand a little better sense a little super sense huh this is the way walking in it huh amen and I Delight to hear those things because what it does is the normal part helps your eyesight helps your speech helps your ears help everything like that but when you get the super sense it comes from God you get baptized with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're Walking With God all things then become possible to you that believe you don't just quit because of what you see you don't quit because of what you hear but you walk because you believe that greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world and my desire is to stay as we look at these thoughts my opinion is to get myself ready for the approach of Jesus Christ to leave here I want to be ready I want to think like he thinks I want to talk like he talks I want to be just like him amen and because of these things in our life what a what a need it is in our life and so many times and I don't mean to be critical by my speech but I just want to bring some things out but I think as these men looking and as that uh we look at these quotes that God has made may God help us to make the proper looks and the proper opinion that makes us what we ought to be and I want to be I've been following the Lord for 50 55 60 years I don't know but you know the thing that I want I want him more than I've ever known him I want him to break up this old man and make it something that's worth something and you know when I look at this and I look at the word of God and I think of things you know I hear people sometimes they say well you know faith faith I say to myself wait a minute y'all be more sincere about faith faith is a statement that we talk like it's nothing but it'll change your entire life and the thing of it is it ought to it ought to move mountains it ought to open up lives it ought to do everything because you're a believer in Christ and you got to believe him something has got to happen to you to ever get you to be a mover in Christ and so as we hear these things and as we believe and we preach and we want to become greater Sons and Daughters of God we must become better uh faith believing people believe that the man that we're talking about tonight I believe is a perfect stature visiting with us may he be with us tonight I haven't preached for a long time but I won't look it up now but I want to I want to say to you that when he came about he told you certain things and he did it he said at first was his Temple of this test the next thing was the things that he did the third thing was Tempest and fourth was saying something else it moved right up to the top of everything the top was love it brought God into the assembly and I thought to myself God I don't only need it and I'll tell you something else what makes faith move is something happens in here without this you don't have this when God goes to dealing with you because of situations in your life needs that you have need of there's something begins to work in here your faith begins to do business with the one that lives in here and all of a sudden now you add virtue and things to your faith you add this to your faith you add this to your faith you add Temperance to your faith you add this to your faith and that to your faith and the first thing you know you got a faith that's empowered by not just by us talking about it but by the the powers of God Amen I want Faith to move those trials that I have I want to see lives changed I want to see the sick healed I want to see the dead raised whatever it is that God wants I want to see it amen because the thing of it is that in our life who lives my life I want to grow Grace in Jesus Christ and as we look at the word of God today and we hear these preachers now I trust honestly that you also open these books and you begin to read them and you say well you know I haven't read this in 10 years some of these are 1950s you said well I wouldn't read it because there's no power in them I beg to differ that with you amen I'll tell you that anyone you want to read it will Empower your life it'll put a vision in you that'll make you want to grow better and more deeper than you've ever been and so as we look at these opinions and we begin to consider the certain things the tests and the trials that go on with that Mama eagle and what she's trying to do is make us Sons and Daughters of God and here we are today trying our best to learn those things and I think as we look at the word of God and I think as we come to church and we see the things that God is doing I I think that God is testing us trying us testing us to find out if we believe God to be those things that he promises them to be for us and the thing of it is is that when I look at it and I looked at these I thought God I walk around and I see my sight and I say to myself I'm always carnal anyhow and then I walk on a little further and I say something else and I say God and the thing of it is is that you begin to realize that you don't need sight what you need is that Supernatural spirit of God to come into your life because that's what he said I never said it when things you get five gifts from almighty God at your birth God will give you sight God will give you sound God will give you hearing he'll do all those five things but when it comes to the sixth it has to come from God and it is the power of the presence of God alive in our life a friend said ought to be there in order to put a smile on your face it ought to put a Stillness in your heart it ought to say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and it ought to cause us to actually do things Miracles power and God Odyssey present in our life and so why we try our best to improve on our eyesight to improve on our speech all the time God's trying to put a a better Creation in you a better understanding of what God has has got for you a supernatural power that God has that power to go into your life how many of you would like that change how many of you would like to be quickened by the power of God they were so powerful by God it would Quicken your mortal life that's a quickening of the mortal when I read that I laid down on my face and all of a sudden my body got to feeling better and I stood up and I said Thank You Jesus because you do take care of this Mortal quickening is him if God can't tell you something to Quicken your opinion you got problems greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he ought to he ought to say y'all to think like that you want to talk like that try to do like that and yet we hear that and we pass it up a lot of things may not matter to us and I'm not trying to be critical but the thing that we want today is we want Christ to become alive in our life amen amen he said one day he said we want to go to Tucson we're going to bring everybody together he said but we've got to get the car ready to go so I want you to test your engine oh you don't have no gas well then you can't go oh you don't have this then you can't do it so we're going to test something you got to bring the car you got to check the motor you got to check the gas you got to check the air you got to check all those things before you're fitting to go to Tucson and the thing in life is the same way a lot of things in our life they don't matter Mama don't matter no more daddy don't matter kids don't matter business don't matter Church doesn't matter people's hurts don't matter friends that ought to hurt you so bad you say yes for me in my house amen I'm gonna do something for God or I'm going to find out and I think that in our lives brothers and sisters and I'm talking to myself my desire is to become more like Christ that's what I desire I haven't preached for a long time because I had an accident but I'm telling you in my life he has got to live he's got to be the quickness Michael yes sir how many of you move under that type of leadership hello that's about 10. serious guys serious I mean that's almighty God trying to control you to do something for you he's not trying to send you out to work if I could say that he's trying to improve that spiritual condition in him and in us we ought to move by the spirit of God or the leadership that God would have for us and yet as we look at life what a strange thing it is and I look at this in the scripture here and I'm thinking about that eagle and I thought about all the tests and trials and I think about the life that I have I I want to be more like Christ than I've ever been in my life and I want to tell you something about Christ he says and does many things to get your attention is that true how many times has he answered prayer for you to find out just how attentive you are to the ways of God sometimes if God says your calls you you obey him but then it just goes from one to the other you haven't learned nothing nor do we become different friends when you find out that you're his and he is yours it ought to make a difference to your life amen you've got more power now than just uh doing nothing you've got power to heal the sick you've got power to touch your wife you've got power to touch this you got power and God becomes responsible for the needs that we have in our life people that search God find God and those that find God they become obedient to God amen and as you read through the scriptures today you find that Brethren are trying their best today to do just that they live for God so that God lives for them and I think that sometimes we get things turned around I don't mean to be ugly about my statements but I'm truthful about them I want God we need God I'm looking for a Rapture I need my heart changed I want my life changed amen and I know this we got a brother in the hospital over here all things are possible today to God that believe but as we look this morning after these things I'd like to turn over to Hebrews if we can Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 2. if we can find it here 12 and 2 looking unto Jesus huh I'm looking under my job or I'm looking at no I'm looking under The Authority the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of the father of the I'm sorry at the right hand of the Throne of God you know when you read something do you ever read them and find out that you're not reading too good and you're just kind of Blazing over everything and catching part of it and sometimes when you pick up these scriptures looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of my faith I want him to do a good job I want to be so positioned that my behavior is what God would have us to be and so as we go on here the author and finisher of my faith you know it was just a little while ago I was out with my brother and we were talking about faith and like I said it seems like I trying to Touch Faith but I couldn't get a hold of God see what I want in my heart I want to believe God and I want him to believe me Jesus loves you how many of you like that and then Heather maybe haven't talked to him for a month and maybe you're caught up in a lot of other ways and we wonder why we're alike we are but I got to wonder with conditions that were around my life I began to look at things and I said to myself it is missing the part that deals with faith he said first you add Faith to your life is that right I could get that man out here let me just pull it for fun just the statue of a perfect man would you like to have him here tonight first add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge but I don't need knowledge I just add faith but you gotta had knowledge virtue to the things that God has given us to have can you say Amen to that after you have that you then you have knowledge you had knowledge to your behavior and then the thing of it is you have Temperance people say things do things you get aggravated and yet with your Temperance you surrender your life to Christ amen and I think today it's the statue of a perfect man I don't think it would hurt anybody to buy them home nobody wants him to go home with you how many of you believe that you need this experience even tonight and the thing with it I'm not being critical I'm just stopping if that's true friends we got issues and I believe if anybody ought to touch a hole to Heaven it ought to be us because I want this to work now everybody preachers everything else he isn't Faith wonderful oh isn't it good and everybody screams yes and I would have to say I would say most of us have a problem with faith maybe it's not proving what it's supposed to prove maybe it's not talking like it's supposed to talk maybe it's the way you got it it don't matter but the thing of it is I believe as you look at your own lives the first thing you want in your life you want Faith but then you got to have virtue and then you got to have after you have that you have the knowledge then you have Temperance and now you're getting up there to where you ought to be and where the place that God would have you to be then you become patient and then you become brotherly kindness and then believe it or not you got the Holy Spirit you got that token I'm sure tonight we have that token how many of you got that token and I believe that a super person if we looked at him tonight I believe the gift of wisdom Was that gift that God gave not the five but the sixth give was the power of that Holy Spirit into your life and mine and so as we're talking here we just get it up to the top of the pyramid and that's love how many of you have loved for everybody one two yeah I'm not being cruel I'm just telling you brothers and says honestly your attitudes can get to a place how many of you believe all things are possible are you in the capability of changing things you believe is that right amen and God does things so that you can prove it and we're going to talk about him here in just a little bit but that's exactly what goes on is that there's proof and then the last thing is love friends without love in our lives what have we got and I always stand up and talk about I can't wait for the Rapture to get here when you might as well tell it goodbye because it ain't coming you say brother Mike you're in a hard man then let's get to Statue of a perfect man and let's find out if you really got faith or have you got what the church things faith is Faith or if you believe to a degree that whatever comes to you you believe that God has that ability to change your life and that's what we're talking about here today about these things that that when that eagle goes flying you may not know what she ever is going to eat you may not know where she's gonna fly but it sure beats that Mama hand amen I'll tell you something and it beats this finest Mama hen stuff how do we have to serve God how can we get mad how can we do this how can we hate the kids how can we do this it's just because you're dealing with Mama hand otherwise you're going to switch Let's Take a Ride let's see if God won't do something for us I believe that it is and I believe the thing of it is most people are not interested in bringing some of these people back to church but that's what we need and so as we see these things what a difference it comes to our life and it comes all the way back to Faith God help faith and virtue all of a sudden life begins to come into you and then the knowledge and the temperance and the patience and the godliness it begins to change your life I itemize those places but we'll just talk here just a moment but I thought about even you know the Lord you know he got a message from somebody and that was the woman that was a Samaritan and she wanted to meet God I don't know what she said or anything about her but he had a desire to get to Samaria is that right God Almighty came to town sent her his brothers and sisters after food while he stayed in town and hopes to talk to the lady that was going to be there shortly all of a sudden God showed up and he said give me a drink of your water she said don't you know that a Jew don't talk to a a man like me he said well he said sis if you knew who was talking to you if you knew who was talking to you tonight right now things would be different Jesus sat right there and talking to her and her life and the thing of it was is you look at that and I marked it to talk about but we'll pass it up but I that's what he came for she needed a Deliverance and she got her Deliverance amen she met God married six times and yet what did that have to do with God he dealt with her because of the needs she had in her life and had changed her life when I read it I thought about myself what that ought to take the very passage of that word and run your issues through life if God can take a woman that has been married six times living with a man shacking up with whatever and all of a sudden comes back and makes a statement and God Almighty comes back to her and said if you knew who was talking to you you'd ask of me I would give you water he said well how can you get water because it's so deep she had her reasons but I'll guarantee you a few moments with him it changed all that familiarology and the thing of it is it's the same power that Knights people today with our Behavior with God it's a God that still answers prayer to our lives and the thing of it was if you check it it washed her clean changed her life and I sat there and I looked I said do you mean to tell me that some gal married six times gonna make Heaven her home now we got people that won't even let one Mary down we got another one that some people do certain things and I'm just asking you have you invited the man in have you talked it over with God do we understand where who it is we're doing business with amen it's such a a wonderful sight to be able to see these things that God has done for us and the matters that he makes you look at that that super sense he said you were smart and he said I give you a sense but he said you got that when you were born how many of you know when you were born with that in that womb of your mama that you that child was a happy camper until she got her he got delivered when he got delivered out of Mom and Daddy he came up to a new world and now he's got a new things to deal with is that true the little child could have stayed in the womb of its Mama till whatever but when the time came she brought the child forth but when the child got out there all of a sudden it began to realize reality and friends I'm trying to bring our minds to a living reality of the things of God we stay up here sometimes so high when sometimes it would pay for you to come down here and start over again and come back up into Christ and understand the greatness of God and what God has made us to be what we are we may not be the greatest person in the world but if you come from him that's all it really matters and as we look at these scriptures and the quotes that he put out what a what an hour it is that God has brought it out and I got Marx I was going to quote him today about the statement and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and once sat on the throne God begins to talk God begins to address personalities here in our life and I believe they become possible to you or I with our belief and I don't know how long we've been sat there we've got just a few more minutes but I got another one spiritual food into in due season you say well brother Patterson I'll tell you something I read this about 45 years ago now I don't know when the last time was I know what brother Ron's got books out in front and I don't know about all they are I got them all but I don't know where they all at I got them stacked away and but I got these and I got the promises here that God has set this for us and I began to read and I'm driving down or walking down and thinking about myself thinking about overcoming I want that I suffered from a stroke I suffer from certain things my speech isn't well I walk down the thing and I see that what God's telling me and what God's bringing into me and now all of a sudden I began to realize spiritual food into season when was the last time you had a nice dinner and I mean but it might have really everybody likes steak everybody likes this but he reminds you several things in here like I said that he reminds you of what he put on you and what he gave you when you were born your sight you're hearing in this but I also put on a supernatural presence that brings you in time with me and I say thank you Jesus because with that I got control over this I got control over this I got control everything in my life but I think about this I mean how many people want to hear spiritual food in due season okay we're going to talk about maybe uh when we're going to preach about this well it's out of season okay maybe we're going to talk about what God did to the woman at the well maybe we're going to talk about people that serve him and have a fountain to drink from instead of a glass of water how many of you drink from a fountain it's for real compared to what else and a lot of people drink it somewhere else and they get a knowledge from someone else but the thing of it is as we look at the word of God spiritual food undue season and you say well brother Patterson go ahead and let it let it be said okay let me just read you a little bit can I eight minutes colored in green some of it some of it's colored in Brown some of it I have to color and something else because they go back and color it and sometimes I read it crazy I read it so fast they just go right over it I thought about these things what a difference it makes an angel come down which was the same kind put him in the sleep again feeding a little guy and woke him up and he had more meal cakes bake for him and he went in the strength of the case for 40 days now this was Elijah and this was the thing that Elijah put forth and the ministry that he had if you want to understand what he did to that little woman that raised him and how he laid uh eating pills dwelling by himself waiting for a rain to start up waiting for the rains to fall and he waited and finally one day he went to see him then there's always a lesson Behind these things there is one coming there are issues that's going on there are problems that we need to know why is it that the message don't go out with the great big places you know you talk about a church you'll they'll go along they'll do a lot to hear it but when it talks to God it becomes different and I think what I'll do is I'll pass up the reading of this because I can't read too good truly the Lord his food was to do the will of God to see works of God made manifest in this hour can I ask you a question how many of you see manifested things relative in this hour I don't know where it starts and I don't know where it finishes but I'll guarantee you what you begin to pass the word around he begins to talk some people a big move of God because they're having a party at the church and they might say to themselves well maybe we need something greater than a party maybe we need to meet God I say that to myself if we begin to look around to a lot of issues that we have and dated it was what man has got rather than what God has got and I don't mean to be critical but I'm just talking to you how many of you believe what I'm telling you and that's a few of you but the thing of it is my brothers and sisters what a great hour it is that God has brought us to this hour that we live in and to make us exactly what we have ought to be because we're going to meet him one of these days amen a lot of things that we call Church people go to church people don't depend on what they hear to change their lives and all I want to see is what God has for us if God said it I believe it I want to follow the walk I want to do what he said greater is he for you or I than anything else in this world people say to me well I'd like to hear something greater than let us pick up another book and we'll read let's talk about that woman that that that that that uh I'm sorry that Berg and how she called that young man to rise up and she did it through a jump and she raised him up and took him for a run and would changed his whole life and what a life that he had and that we made over here to the Statue of a perfect man then we move over here to church ages and then we move over here to the things it's got to say a super sense and the things that we're looking at this morning may the power and grace of God fill your hearts and Minds he's coming soon friends how can we continue to say that and not believe that and are you ready am I ready are you ready and a lot of things that we Dibble and Dabble in the world we may not give God our total amount and we look at things and we begin to consider things I want what he wants I want the statue of a perfect man I want the secrets I want the promises I want to know everything that God's got for us may the Lord bless you today and all I can tell you is that through prayer and dedication you're going to get a good look at yourself I look at myself and I have to say dear God I need more of you amen I need what you would have I don't know what all you would say they say do you have faith I got to be honest that's a small word but you see when you got faith and you're using it you got faith but when faith is not being used I think people ought to really be able to touch God for faith and if they can't they get virtue and if they can't get virtue they get Temperance if they can't get that they just keep moving up eventually God begins to deal with them and I think it is that if we love God if what we ought to what a difference it would begin to make in our heart and life could we have the music player now I guess it's about time is that what they do about they don't didn't deny I could keep on going I really did want to bring some of these statements to you on temperance and I you know I I people sometimes say Michael you're just good that's just but you know sometimes I have to tell them who I am I'm not the happiest guy in the world at times and yet the fourth thing was temperance you hide your temperance some people got mad at church some people get mad at this Saturday or the other friends but what it is it's I'm interested in my calling amen I want to be able to climb this mountain through faith to every expression that there is I want to get up there to where the love of God abides in our life amen I want his eagle to feel the power of inspiration to fly I want to realize what my Lord and Savior did with that woman in Samaria I want how he changed his life and I want you to know how that when God did certain things he left it up to you to find out if it was accomplished and some people don't accomplish it they don't know that it will accomplish it if God did it let us do it and it ought to be that we're in our life and may God help us to see these things that God has for us [Music] trying to develop us I hear as a preacher preachers talking about a rapture and I have to look around I say God am I ready is so and so ready is my brother ready is my sister ready and that's what we want want seek power how many of you like to see people healed could I ask you a question how many of you ever take that really to Heart and the thing of it is get alone somewhere with God and you stay there until you finally touch home with God you say well I I spent about three minutes and maybe once every month to talk about it and I think it ought to in my own life there's something inside me says I want something in here that will push this thing I want something in here that'll bring Jesus Christ on the scene I want to see him heal the sick and raise the Dead I want him to see something to people's lives how many of you believe that God's able to do great and powerful issues friends if you believe that and you really hone down on it it really ought to change lives amen but if you don't believe that's something else and I believe what we do we do believe the things that God has for us and may we go on to be more like him and pick up that super sense want to be like him amen I want everything I do I want to I'm not trying to please man trying to please God I know a lot of times in our life we got heartaches we got issues I got him in my own life and all of a sudden when you begin to talk to God I want to know who I am I want to know the power of those things that we got here I want to tell you I called the man I couldn't get that thing to work and I got the man here and now it works and you know I listen sometimes to different preachers or whatever I wonder just how close people are because I want to know what they're doing you see you're just picking I want to hear it this is the way walking in it followed Christ that's what I want tell me how do you speak in tongues do you get close to God what it is that you do or I do God knows and the coming of the Lord is at hand I want to be ready I want to be ready amen I want to see things changed I want to see my life every bit just like him when he said Michael as yes sir here I am amen when he says I want you to come out here I want you know I heard brother Brandon talk I'm sorry to go back again but he says you know I got a call from a young man that got drunk drank all his life turned in he had cancer every part of his body had cancer on the incoming Blood on the kidneys or everything he had it had blood and cancer his mama said sir could you go see him and so he decides he'd go down to the hospital to see him loaded with cancer and the thing of it was is that he prayed for him two of his friends was everybody said bow your head let's pray he said he prayed for him and the next morning the child was up and made well under the power of God and I say Lord did it take a prophet or could it be someone like me do you ever feel like you're you're maybe a little bit of a prophet nobody how many of you feel like you're anointed that whatever you might ask it might change now we're talking so you begin to feel that maybe you've got a power and a presence and everything that brother Branham would go to there'd be he had touched them or he'd pray for him and God would heal them and the thing of it is I have to say God that is a lesson to us we ought to do those self-same things in our life I'm not here to be critical I'm here to tell you greater is he that's in you greater is he that's in you greater is he that's in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world how many of you believe that then take a look at it looks pretty good don't it he belongs to me I belong to him I'm his he's mine I'm going to treat him different I'm going to believe him different things change and I believe that's the hour that we're coming amen and that's what God made us to be let us stand and let us sing our chorus what's playing [Music] Touchstone [Music] [Music] the way I want to hear until they're just normal
