remodel we could come out here praise the Lord otherwise the other option we had was the front of the church take the chairs put them on the rocks and the gravel and in the Heat and I'm sure you like this option better how many say amen amen amen praise the Lord thank you for all the musicians and for the sound guys and for everyone making it possible to come out here and do that God bless you musicians thank you we're going to just make a few announcements then we're going to go to the word uh brother on um Ethan Strayer are we live streaming we are okay praise the Lord okay because I didn't know I told him I said look if it's too much if it's too hard too technical then we won't live stream and uh so uh but we are so praise the lord we will have these Services archived now um uh tonight is going to be a little bit different we had the Brethren had asked me brother Ron how do you want to set it up do you want the pulpit over there do you want the people wide and I said well remember the gospel goes from east to west is that right we know that it travels from uh does anybody know which way is east Amos stand up and point it's that way so the gospel is traveling tonight from east to west praise the Lord Brother Branham had always said if I had a church and I wanted it exactly the way I would have the pulpit in the East the word going to the West praise the Lord so you are fulfilling prophecy tonight God bless you um ah now it is my desire for this Sunday and for the next Wednesday the Lord willing that we just don't scatter all over but what I do is bring everybody a little bit more forward come up here and and we're not going to do it tonight but Sunday will probably be needing to fill all these chairs so I don't want everybody as far back as uh where uh brother Mario is at and those are the different ones back there Marlon I should say Marlin and Allison uh can you hear me hello God bless you Marlon uh so anyway uh what I would like you to do is on Sunday when you come here so we're gonna we're gonna really use our Usher and he's gonna and our deacons were gonna really bring him and pack them in here a little bit closer yes we will use those back there but I think brother Michael has said to reserve those for the families the little ones so that they get up and and if they have to get up and go use a nursery or something now for tonight for tonight only you if you want to you can go into Fourier here or go out the doors of the Fourier and into the kitchen door and this room right here is made like for nursing mothers privately okay and if others wanted to sit out there with their children or whatever that'll be fine on Sunday morning I'm going to open the West End the Sunday School side we're going to open that up we'll have a room or two um set up there for the nursing mothers and for the different ones that need to take care of their children that is not set up tonight while we remodel the church that means the church is off limits tonight after service nobody's going to go over there and go walking through and lose your kid and not be able to find him during the construction so uh please Sunday also um I don't want anybody wandering around I don't need to tape up and put a screen and everything so that people no they're just going to put some chairs and say this is it boundary no further our Deaconess sister Monica level is going to stay at the end of the hallway there and straight arm anybody I don't want you to use even the restrooms over there okay use these it'll be for here for this Sunday everybody understand we can be flexible huh praise the Lord listen you ought to go out onto the out onto the uh out of the out onto the trail where you're preaching the gospel out in the highways and byways you don't have nice facilities you don't have the ability like we do here the old brush Arbor meetings the old uh you know a lot of times I told them maybe want to just throw some sawdust in here turn off the AC get a few cold Coleman lamps in here and and uh make you feel right at home as an old brush Arbor meeting because let me tell you how many member go on to Dan daisley sometime in the preaching and they had a tent or it was outside huh and you remember I saw Donnie Reagan sweating I tell you he can sweat and he and and everybody else was sweating too though because he wasn't the only one I could say I was sweating almost as much as he was but praise the lord we have an ability tonight to be here so um let's see here we are live streaming okay we hope to have the renovation done by Friday July 21st that's a week from this Friday if we don't we will make an announcement of how sister Linda Lau if you have an email and you have the church app you then will be sent an email sister Linda will sit we'll let you know if we have to have it here again two Sundays in a row I don't think so I don't think we'll need to but if we do you know just in the event then we would do that so praise the Lord amen are you guys ready for church I'm ready and if you'll stand together with me and let's go to second Corinthians you know I'm having a hard time I don't have a platform up here everybody David you are too tall and it's just I can't after the second or third row Austin come here a second Johnson yeah come here I need your help for a minute I want you to bend over no no yeah there we go okay are you ready come on can you get up okay I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles hey this is a good view from up here yeah okay are you comfortable okay let me down I like that view from up there I've been high challenged my whole life anyway Bliss thank you he didn't know Heaven how heavy I was he didn't know if he could get up yeah praise the Lord yeah but you guys go to the gym you press them like this it's okay anyway let me gather my composure here a little bit in my wind anyway second Corinthians 11 verses one through four would to God you could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband then I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ for he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom you have not preached we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him father God in the name of Jesus I ask that you would speak to our hearts take this text father as we have waited and labored in meditation I pray that father you will take those things that you have revealed to me and spoken to me and caused me to study over these things that the word of God would be rightly divided the a Workman that would need not to be ashamed rightly dividing Thy word so father we need the Holy Spirit to come and Quicken our minds our thoughts I pray not only quickened my mind but Quicken the minds of the hearer because we know the holy spirit is the Divine revealer of the word come now Open the Eyes of our heart we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated turn with me if you would I'd like two more scriptures turn with me to the book of Titus Titus Chapter 1. right after a second Timothy is Titus Titus 1 7 through 14. for a bishop must be blameless as a steward of God not self-willed not soon angry not given to Wine no Striker not given to filthy lucra but her lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men sober just totally temperate holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught that he may be able to by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy Luther's sake of themselves even a prophet of their own said the Christians are always Liars evil beasts slowbillies this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that may be sound in the faith not giving heed to Jewish Fables and Commandments of men in turn from the truth turn with me if you would to the gospel of Saint Mark Saint Mark chapter 7. verses 6 through 9. and he answered and said to them well hath Isaiah's prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me I'll be in vain they do worship the worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing it gives examples here as washing of pots and of Cups and many other such things ye do and he said unto them full will he reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition God bless the reading of your word this evening and I am titling this losing our Simplicity this is part five I don't know that I'll have a another part to this but if I do it'll only be a tangent off of this actually the word of God is a never-ending story all we do is we let you go home go to work go to bed eat sleep and then come back and we continue the story because it never ends in fact I'm going to tell you a secret that brother Branham said the unfolding of the Gospel will continue throughout the eternities he is so great and he is so mighty and his power is so great and his wisdom beyond the fathom of man and of carnal mind that it will take an eternity for God to reveal himself wow I don't know about you but my little finite brain all of a sudden my hard drive is overloaded I can't comprehend that but I do know this that when he comes and our bodies are changed in light to his body we shall know him even as he is known there will be no more carnality thinking there'll be no this but we will have the very mind of Christ and we will be like him even as he is hallelujah what a day that will be and I believe it's going to be soon I believe the days of the Gentiles is just about over I believe that time for the Gentile door of its being open is soon to be completely shut and when God does there'll be not another Gentile saved no because the Salvation will be over blood leaves The Mercy Seat God requires blood if there's no more blood than the foolish virgin give their blood so I would rather right now today take the Judgment of God to myself because judgment begins at the house of God we are here to now see where we fall short and God help us and enline our lives up that our lives will be worthy of the Gospel foolish virgin doesn't do it no oil no full revelation of the word of God therefore there's no desire really to get their life straightened up oh God help us to be all elect bright that elect lady that says oh God help me speak to me let me be found worthy of thy coming so tonight losing our Simplicity part five I want to speak on unruly and vain talkers deceivers now we know that just as the early church had false prophets and false teachers come and as the Holy Ghost filled Church within just a few decades this well wasn't hundreds and hundreds of years this is 20 and 30 years already they're losing their love for God they have lost their first love they've already got ones coming in that's separating the Sheep the false prophets false teachers he didn't mean this he didn't mean that hymenius and philitus have already come shook the church resurrection's already over and overthrown the faith of some that's the early church that's a holy ghost-filled ones that most of them saw a Pentecost of Acts chapter 2. so regardless of having the holy spirit in your life regardless of having a holy spirit Ministry regardless of of the workings of God and signs and wonders Among Us the devil does not sleep and he is constantly bombarding the Church of the Living God and you are his Target and the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind therefore let us take every thought bring its subject and captive to the mind of Christ can you say Amen to that now I ask you this question how can this happen so quickly to the Church of the Living God because we know the devil will do everything that he can he goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he told Peter Peter I know the devil is trying to sift you like wheat but I've prayed for you oh my my brother my sister that you are no match for the devil brother Branham said you must stay behind the protection of the word lest the enemy come in hybridize the word of God and you become hybridized yourself lukewarm formal powerless religious from such the Bible says turn away it's amazing how quickly a Revival dies Moses was only gone for 40 days and he built a golden calf whenever the angel messenger goes off the scene I'm going to I'm going to speak to you in the natural sense to just appeal to your understanding that there is after the messenger goes off the scene there's a bunch of leaders vying to take the position of the leadership of the church they want to fill the vacuum they want to be the next Joshua they want to be the Timothy they want to be somebody and we have even in this age and many of them who feel they are the prophet after the prophet The Eighth Day messenger or however way you want to look at it they all use the message as a platform for the springboard of their own Ministry brother Branham said there'll not be two of us here at the same time he said well when one goes off the scene the other one will come on and they use those quotes where you know uh I'm lit if I have not done the work that God has told me to do if I'm not really the last one I'm laying a platform for another man to come now that is true my brother and sister but it's not a natural man I want to say to you that have a revelation in your heart it is a revealing of the son of man so the platform he is laying is not Behold a man he's be saying behold the son of man I'm showing you the revealing of the mystery of God as he is revealed to his servants the prophets amen all of them using the prophet's message as a platform to vindicate their own Ministry this happened in the Church of galatia Paul had to to warn them in Galatians 1 6-12 if you'd like to write that down or follow along in your Bible Galatians 1 6 through 12. I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel how has this happened so easily removed you that know better which is not another but there's some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven now he gets very personal preach any other gospel unto you that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and he says it again as we said before and so I say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that you have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ oh God we know that you're going to build your church upon the solid rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not upon what you have learned by man it isn't given to you by man you uh he you are not educated into it you can't be taught it by men it's got to be the Revelation though the ministry have a holy ghost Ministry it must be a holy ghost Ministry in those that sit on the chair that they hear what the spirit is saying unto the church somebody say Amen it's true in Galatians chapter 3 verse 1 Paul again says o foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you we're only talking 60 years since the time of calvary come on that you should not obey the truth just imagine that just a few years only a few decades many of the Apostles and early disciples were still alive who Bewitched you Galatians 5. verses seven through nine you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth oh don't Glory over the fact oh my I remember in the early days and we ran we did this we did that yeah you ran well but this ain't no friend this is a marathon this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven beloveds the whole lump just a few short years already the early church begin to be attacked by false brethren false prophets false teachers seducing clear clergy Spirit brother Brown said you know what a seducing spirit is in the church he said how how does a seducing Spirit come in he said it's a seducing clergy spirit yeah in the sermon lamb and the dove I'm giving you these quotes you can go onto our website you can read them in their entirety but better yet go listen to the tape the lamb in the Dove 1956 Los Angeles at last steaming I kind of butchered it kind of hard he means I really I really preached the gospel pretty Blood and Guts everywhere he butchered it pretty hard I didn't mean to do that in that way to hurt you this is the night before excuse me this is the night after the service that he preaches and I listened to it last night you want to talk about a guy that really gets hard on Pentecost and you've left your first love he is there 50 years after 1906 it is 1956 it is in Angela's Temple it is among those who many of them were a part of that Revival this is the night after he preaches Azusa Jubilee listen to this but since you have included me in your rank I'm trying my best to stand mutually between the different denominations because they've already denominated we are a Brethren I love all the denominations I'm trying to stand in the Gap and say we are Brethren together and I believe if God will let me have something to do in uniting the body of Christ I think that's the sickest body that I know of but the greatest Divine Healing that needs to be done tonight is the body of Christ to be healed in one person and what a marvelous time to do it right now at Azusa Street rally where we can all become one again it seemed to be in my own church brother Brown's talking about his own church I kind of would say I'm the black sheep I believed in a real holy and filled life and then when I found that there was people who stood for that it just fit like glove on a hand and then when I come into the rank here be looked down and see that it's slipping away that kind of stirs me up it's not because I need to do not like you I say those cutting things it's because I do love you when I see the enemy leaping in back here and the worldlyism creeping into the church I just can't hold my peace in the sermon here ye him I want to say this before I start preaching the greatest need of healing tonight and the sickest body that I know of in all the world is the body of the Lord Jesus the church oh it's horribly sick it's broke up it's scattered it needs a healing may God send the holy spirit in such a power till the whole body of Christ will be brought together bound with love and unity we would see Jesus just a few months later I believe that there is the need of healing tonight more than physical healing he trying to wean them away from the physical healing he said if you got healed this week you might die of another sickness next I want to ask you which is greater physical healing or spiritual healing physical eyesight or spiritual eyesight we we have tended to get off of looking at what is greater Jesus said Philip to he says to Philip behold in Israel whom there is an old guile oh Rabbi rabbi he says because I told you behold an Israelite I discerned your heart greater than these you'll see angels Angels ascending against greater things I want to make all of you aware that there is a greater healing Than Physical yet we believe in physical healing but God the sickest body there is because your Prophet said it is the body of Christ why they fail to discern the Lord's body amen Ephesians 4 verse 11 and 15. he gave some Apostles somebody say some some Prophets some evangelist some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints that means the maturing for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure the stature the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men in cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love May grow up into all him into him in all things which is the head even Christ till we come to the unity of the faith how can we have Unity of faith when sir we're so broken up by interpretation and opinion and isms within the message there's only one way to be able to have the unity of the Revelation and that is to have the unity of the Faith by say what he said leave it alone don't change it just leave it alone you don't need your opinion don't need your interpretation God is his own interpreter the bride will be United with the word and will be one with the word why because she is word born it's a word birth blind Bartimaeus 1950 Sand 57 the prophet says next week the Lord willing I want to preach on a greater healing a healing in a higher standard that's the healing of the body of the Lord Jesus is broken body isn't that interesting I want to talk about a greater healing brother Brown said the pattern is the same in every age has been from Ephesus all the way to laudiusia I don't want to Major on a minor brother Brahm said evidence of the Resurrection 1958 Jeffersonville but today you can preach repentance and Hell Fire in Brimstone and people will laugh at it what's the matter our hearts are cold we're indifferent we got too much we need less of the world and more of God our hearts are too cold we've become interested in some emotion we become interested interested if we can dance if we can shout I believe in that if we can speak in tongues I believe in it I believe in every bit of it but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broke up Spirit a broken and contrite spirit I will not refuse you know one thing that really blows my mind where is humility among the ministry and the message find me a humble preacher instead we have arrogant leaders getting up there they become The Untouchables God give us humility let me tell you my brother my sister I am nothing without him I can do nothing amen but with him I can do all things through Christ it strengthens me I'm tired of the politicking the arrogance and the the proud Spirits pride comes before a fall the ministry is no longer the Servants of the people but the people are the servants to the ministry what a shame Jesus said if you want to be great learn to be the servant of all he said which is greater he said you're sitting in a chair and you're being served he said is not he that is being served greater than the one that's serving because you're sitting down in French Oba or in German huh German yeah Oba come here Peter so what you're doing you're asking God God here I am I've been I've been through hell this week I've been through troubles I I need a word tonight I need you to tank me off tonight I need to top off I've been running on fumes why the devil's been chasing me I've been having problems that's good for you Billy Paul when he said daddy daddy pray for me pray for you for what well the devil's after me and I'm so nervous I just I just don't know what to do he said that's good for you Billy he said it shows me one thing he hasn't got you your trials and temptations you're going to go through it yes you're not a bunch of baby hot house plants no you don't be put into a tunnel after you've been born again and nothing of the world bothers you and you walk around in the euphoric state of Nirvana it's okay love love love that's nonsense man the moment you get converted the moment you get born again you got a bullseye in your target a Target on your back and the devil's doing everything he can to try to dissuade you bombard your mind it's using media he's using television radio uh uh movies he's using every billboard everything around you why this is Satan's Eden but here in the midst of Satan's Eden Hallelujah God has got a bride who is being kept by the spirit of God and it no matter how dark it doesn't matter how bad it gets he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle glory to God and let me tell you let me pop your bubble and eat because of you it's because of the seed that God put into you and God watches over his seed he said I made a promise to your father Abraham that I will watch over the seed and to the seed seed even to as many as the Lord Our God shall call that includes Us in ladies aesthetically includes us here in July of 2023 in the midst of a dark and dying and a lgbq lyc and everything else such a bombardment of the minds he says we become interested in some emotion but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping and broken spirit brother Branham also give you another quote right here off the top of my head brother Abraham said he gives the Holy Ghost to those who who sigh and cry for the Abomination I'm not talking about out there because he's their father and their Works he will do but he Sighs and cries the Abominations that come right on into the church and Brethren and sister let me tell you tonight the devil's doing everything he can to invade the Bride of Jesus Christ and to cause her to become powerless weak formal religious um God can never use it these things are good but we got to have the other way to go with it we've left off the main thing and gone for a secondary you can never major on a minor how about those that go to sighing and crying are you one of them amen the gift is wonderful hear his works it's fair Lord help me I've been eating The Grapes of Canaan and I'm so excited I'm slobbering let me slow down help me to articulate my words because except the trumpet gives a certain sound you won't know what to do works is Faith expressed 19 and 65. the gift is wonderful but you can't use your Eternal destination on gifts you gotta major on a minor and a gift is a minor and Satan can impersonate any gift of that God has got he can make something just look exactly like it see therefore we got to watch sometimes I express about Shelton I've seen demons shout see speak in tongues I've seen demons speak in tongues sure he impersonates it it's a it isn't a genuine but it impersonates it see makes it look like it's real and people sometimes we don't know the difference declare this to be real when it isn't real same thing they do with Divine Healing they think well it's a Hocus Pocus or something like that it isn't it's a genuine unadulterated faith in God on what he said to be the truth and that anchors when it anchors and there's nothing in a movie it's going to stay there Psalms 107 verse 20. he sent his word and it healed them and delivered them from their destruction brother Branham said in Jehovah Jireh 1961. now if you do not believe remember don't come in the prayer line then he says I wanted for some of the Brethren on this side and some on that side ministers to form a prayer line but before I start the prayer line listen friends I want to ask you brethren I got perfect confidence in you as my brethren I know your men of God called of God I'm trying to let this audience know that they don't have to wait for somebody to come by or with a special gift gifts don't heal gifts only declare God so your gift is to do that that the original way is to believe the word he sent his word to heal them that's the way it's supposed to be but then God's so good and he makes such promises if you can't believe the word then he shows them a sign that it's him there a prophet is a sign now do you believe me to be God's prophet I don't say that of my own do you believe me you do you see now all of a sudden he goes into that prophetic gift and what God is doing is he is uplifting their faith because they didn't have enough faith in the word alone that he gives them a sign and a prophet is a sign so the prophet who has the word he takes the people and as Austin Johnson took me and lifted me up you couldn't keep me that way the whole service Maybe but brother Ram said here I am using a gift and he said can you see it can you see it no no I see you you're a young man Liz he said here I am with my gift I lift him up over the fence do you see it do you see it yeah yeah I see it now are those things true he gets a complex because after years and years and years of then Ministry of lifting people up and what good is it done tell their name where they come from even heal their bodies many have never even come back and say thank you as far as I'm concerned I'm going up into the mountains grow my hair long I'm gonna be a Trapper forget it God wants to send me into the valley I'll come down here give him thus saith the Lord go right back up do you know why God allowed that Prophet go beyond the curtain of time because he didn't see while he was alive churches like evening Light Fellowship Believers International he didn't see these churches around the world no sir a little man here and a little man over here and this one you're a great man of God even Billy Paul says I did not know who Daddy was until he died trying to do God a service 1965 in Jeffersonville I wonder today if all of your drawing in and great Crusades and revivals if we haven't been filling up the Methodist Arc the Baptist Arc the Presbyterian Ark but what about the Ark of Christ the word if the brightest to be the word then she's got to be of Christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day the word for this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his fourth sent his word forth to mold his bride and make her God has promised in his word that he would choose his bride in this last day did you know that is what God has done in this ladiesian age he sent his word Vindicated it by signs and wonders through the mouth of a prophet he sent his revealed word through the prophet of this hour but I'm going to warn you do not get your eyes focused on the vessel that God used because Moses was only a messenger Moses was following the pillar of Fire and I say unto you in this Third Exodus that we are having today yes we have a messenger but the messenger followed the pillar of Fire so the messenger was he would move and it moved is that right he would stop when it stopped hallelujah it's no different today but you don't get your eye on the messenger and they thought are you the Christ are you the Messiah he said I'm not in fact he said it's a lying ungodly lie of the devil don't you never believe that I'm Jesus Christ so he was Discerning Spirits were working within the church people that went to his own church how would you like to be sitting there Branham Tabernacles now about 150 people he said I've got 15 20 people sitting here right now believe I'm Jesus Christ how could they do it I went to him tried to show him in a word and he said if a spirit ever gets on you like that you'll absolutely believe it no matter what somebody tells you he said shows you are anointed with a wrong spirit churches have spirits don't get your eyes focused on the messenger but on his message for John the Baptist said I must decrease that he must increase he said the ministry that I have the baptism that I have is under repentance but he said there's one coming after me who's Ministry is far greater than mine his baptism is much greater I baptize you water unto repentance that's good I'm glad you heard the word you got baptized praise the Lord keep going but he said there's one coming after me whose baptism is far greater I'm not even worthy to take his shoes off for he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire fire is the greatest cleansing agent there is in the world today water is a universal solvent but it doesn't take away all the germs that's why they have an enclave in a dentist's office in a hospital or different places and you want to clean the tools they've been working on somebody else's dirty filthy teeth I'm Brian that's right you want them to use the same tools and not even clean them how about if they just rinse them in water you know what they do they put them in an enclave you know what that is that's a baptism of Fire they put them in there because they don't want any germs to come through right oh God what we need is a real baptism of Fire huh not just the cleansing of water but a baptism of Fire Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 blind leaders of the blind God is not known by education he is not known by how to explain it God is known by a simplicity and of the revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ in the Life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminances to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it's not even called to at all Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding he says in paragraph 304 by the lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division Among Us is because of people lack that Revelation what of the unfolding word Prophet began to see all the divisions called them Beaver preachers damning up the river of the holy spirit it's us flooring no more my pastor is greater and your pastor my dad can whip your dead we're losing our Simplicity that's in Christ if someone doesn't see it the way we see it it breaks our fellowship that ought to be First Corinthians 1 verses 10 through 15 I beseech your brethren by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing wow he says I beseech you by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you speak the same thing and let there be no divisions among you that you may be perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Chloe that there are contentions among you now this I say every one of you saith I'm of Paul and I am of Apollos I of cephas and I of Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God I baptize none of you but Christmas and guess any should say that I baptized him in my own name Paul's sick of the early church he comes in one born out of due season he comes in and spent three years after a divine intervention of God blinding him to open his eyes who then is Paul who's Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the Lord hath given every man I planted Apollos water but God gave the increase so then there is neither he that planteth anything neither he that whatareth but God that giveth the increase somebody say God gives the increase now he that planets and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with God and you're God's husbandry you are God's Building don't judge something because of its anointing anointings can fool you false Revelation is just as stimulating as true revelation I've told you before just very quickly a hunter and if you don't get Buck Fever when you get out there and you get among you see a big bull you shouldn't be hunting because I tell you what anybody that's a real Hunter all of a sudden man they see a big bull oh my my glasses would steam up I'd have to take them off get All Shook Up Man here he comes here he comes come on baby come on he went behind this big old tree and I saw his big old right side of his horns sticking out and it's moving I was like I got you just move and I have to keep pulling away from my scope to get my glasses and quit fogging come on baby come on here it is it's just moving like 10-15 minutes later come on man I don't have much patience get out from behind that tree foreign brother Daniel I took the high pirate scope I torqued it up to 10 or 12 whatever it was a branch I was so intent on looking to him coming out behind that tree I saw a branch and I thought that was it wasn't it was a branch he probably walked slowly right out into a broadside shot waiting for me to shoot him can I asked God to give them to me and I saw intent on my false Revelation I missed it it is yeah you get so excited that's it that's it okay I'm on it man I got it I got it I ain't got it you're like a lion dog barking up the wrong tree brother said you ever hunted a you have to know how they do it because he said if you got a dog that just goes by the nose they come off they go running they're all little pack of dogs and they're all no sniffers oh and they run run oh and they get around the tree and they are hmm like my dog does it every Bush at the park s they're barking treat and here comes a hunter okay okay Bessie you got him baby you got him right up that tree where is that dude it ain't there you lying Doug he said because he said like the preachers today lion dog he's there that Devil's up that tree we got him treated he's here we're gonna kill him he said and because that lion dog only went by his his smell and not by sight he said a good dog catches the scent up the tree and then goes he's up there and when he goes from limb to limb that dog follows him [Music] otherwise they're all of the lion Prophets they're around that tree over there here he is here he is he ain't there God give us some good good dogs amen amen all right are you okay are you comfortable are you falling asleep on me okay don't fall asleep now all the early church was already struggling with false prophets coming in sowing their little seeded Discord pulling groups off this little group this little group now watch this first Corinthians 3 follow along in your Bible if you can the early church were already struggling Paul came years after First Corinthians 3 verses one through nine and I Brethren could not speak to you as under spiritual but as unto carnal even us babes in Christ at least he gave him the benefit of the doubt that their babes in Christ think you're so spirit but you're so carnal you're so watch I have fed you with milk not with me for hitherto you are not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are yet carnal watch this for whereas there is among you and being and strife and divisions are you not carnaling walk as men for a while once say I'm appalling another I'm of Apollos are you not carnal how about us today well I'm of Ron and I'm of Dawn and I'm of John and I'm of him and I'm of them and I and guess what my preachery's better than yours ah nonsense I don't even try to keep up with these yeah no I am what I am can't be anyone else people said brother Ron I know why you why wear Levi's and cowboy boots and a cowboy hat because you want to be like the prophet there's a carnal in person are you kidding me I was raised in Levi's in cowboy in fact I'll tell you what the first pair of boots that my father had or the first pair of shoes that was given to us Tony Lama you guys heard Tony Lama custom boots Tony Lama as a birthday or as a birth present to my father got cowboy boots and had them custom-made and gave them to my dad so the first pair of shoes I had was Vaqueros con botas you caught that Billy huh cowboy boots yeah I like to wear Levi's I am not Rob Detweiler said brother Ron you're not very GQ what in the world is GQ yeah you don't wear slick uh slacks all the time you you know you don't wear nice fresh shirts you come out you wear Levi's you wear a pair of and old boots or something like that an old hat or a or a baseball cap I'm here to try to impress you I know I'm not GQ I don't even try to be in fact I'll give you you guys if you ever think that I dress nicely it's not because of me my wife tells me honey the only taste you have is on your tongue you guys know those yellow stick em things that you put on little the possum stick them things and huh she takes this jacket with this shirt and she puts a little blue shirt with brown jacket or whatever you call this and she puts him inside and so when I get there but if it's not really tightly packed guess what happens to the shirts and all of this stuff and they move and the yellow things get rubbed off well this last time she's I told her I said I got a problem so she pins them okay but there was one time I I got there and I went I shook all the shirts and everything hung them up and there was yellow things all over the floor it says I don't know what to wear what matches I try to think but because I don't dress myself I mean your kids at school mom what do I wear right is it true David okay so it's so funny they took pictures and they sent it back to Sandy you know Instagram or whatever and they sent it hey there's Ron preaching she goes oh my goodness Ron you embarrassed me why those don't match how did that happening so anyway praise the Lord okay because every time before service I say is my clothes out yeah yeah I get the belt and shoes other than that that's for forget it she gets everything else so thank you Sandy now so now Paul said look while one says I'm Paul and another Apollos are you not I can't even call you guys spirit I want to just interject something here if you don't mind it's nine o'clock we're gonna go into overtime why are people so tossed about I want to ask you why are people so tossed about if you haven't heard the sermon go listen to it 1956 some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that what was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had that anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure now the way we would think if such anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before huh and when he was there and then the type of that anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he did under the anointing the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how wow Supreme anointing under control Supreme paw you see or I thank God that a prophet comes in here he says don't lose your simplicity that's in Christ amen First Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church they got problems Corinthian Church man they are so spiritual every time they get together one's got a Psalm one's got a hymn one's got a prophecy one's got a tongues wow these people are so spiritual watch what Paul says First Corinthians 14. verses 22-28 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying servth not for them that believe not but for them which believe see the difference if the whole church coming together in one please and I'll speak with tongues then there come in those that are unlearned unbelievers will they not say you're mad but if all prophesy there come in one that believeth not or unlearned is he convinced of all he is judgable and thus are the secrets the heart made manifests and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth how is it then Brethren watch this when you come together every one of you half the song half the doctrine half the tongue hath of Revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying If any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most by three that by course let one interpret there be no interpretive letter and keep silence in the church and let them speak to himself and to God tongues are a sign not to the believer that's what he said now the Bible says I'll get in let me let me just give you a couple quotes and I'll back it up there with the scripture a lot easier in church then there's all this talk about the glacier the falling of the Holy Spirit anointing all over on the bride on the foolish virgin on seed and in on seed supposed to be the evidence of the baptismal he goes and people are thinking that we're in the midst of a great Revival Revival's over America had her last chance in 1957. now the tongues are God's sign of impending disaster um isn't it amazing how many of the ministers within the church are really talking a lot about tongues right now it's not to the believer let's read what brother Branham says it's a sign of impending disaster even as they were when there appeared on the Paul the wall of belshazzar's feast don't you know the last day Lord Lord we've done all these wonderful works and even cast out Devils will say depart from me you workers of iniquity you get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophesy coming forth in all manner of the Supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he is of the Lord even though he's actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin the only answer that he have is absolutely on on and unbiblical answer well we get results must be of God how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of God and the poor poverty stricken ones don't even know it how can we be so spiritual and bring television back into the house do you know anybody who claims to be very hyper spiritual and revelated and got all kinds of wow bright Revelation and at home they got television we're losing our simplicity God help me he said now kick it out I remember one time we took our kids with us and some of the preachers had cornered Amos one time and because he's a preacher's kid hey what did what does your dad teach about television and what did Prophet say about it so Amos says yeah I know what he said I'll tell you what he says you take that television and you kick it outside and you watch it outside I we lost him at the first mall they made in Flagstaff for the big Flagstaff Mall next to the Rawson purina plant we're walking through there we've got all our kids in the line and somehow Sandy lost his little hand as we're walking the five of us walking through the mall we lost him that's a horrible feeling because you got your kid and all these people and where is he where is he and we start running back and everything and here's a whole wall of televisions they're all on the same channel I said Amos what are you doing I'm watching the radio we used to let him listen to the craft Mystery Theater you know and the door opened and the footprints who did that okay in the footprints okay and the kids would sit next to the radio and because it was so descriptive right well the TV it just you know so anyway I don't know why I said all that stuff except for the fact that hey we're losing our simplicity these things the Bible says if I bring in those things which I once destroyed I make myself a transgressor amen do you understand let's if brother Branham said the token applied to the home he kicked those things out well it's okay I'm more spiritual God help us huh I'm talking about losing our Simplicity in Christ amen so he says now you get these men and come come and pray for the uh this and people will follow him brother Graham says I want you to to watch a resume of the Ages page 377. to trace the two churches and the two Spirits from Pentecost to their consummation how many know he said the two Vines let's start in Genesis Exodus Leviticus Deuteronomy all the way down all the way to the Book of Revelation there it is the two Vines the two trees are we together on that he said watch the two Spirits now brother Branham says in resume of the ages as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the Bride As she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can only come after the former Reign which is the spring or teaching ring thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening under the Rapture had not come listen to what he said here's your prophet it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils are you listening yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove it was not the real these people even before a second generation appeared they organized they wrote their unscriptural doctrines built their own fences and as every other group did before them we're not going back to Pentecost Pentecost was in its day and God has gone beyond it many quotes I don't need to see when somebody tell you we're going back to no the Pentecost which Pentecost are you talking about Acts 2 or 1906. I want you to understand Pentecost is an experience with God you know what I am a Pentecost by birth amen I wasn't raised in the Pentecostal church but I am I have had my Pentecost Hallelujah I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and had I not been filled with the Holy Ghost I'd have been so vexed with people and places and things I'd have gotten an upset and all of the different ones because you know what who uh who hasn't been offended who hasn't had somebody say something against you and they claim to be the bride I'll tell you what when you go to fighting among yourselves and you go to Talking around your dinner table about others who don't see it just exactly like you your kids and stuff I'll look at you one day and say there ain't nothing to this mess because one day you may change your mind to say he's a great man of God he's preaching a sermon this weekend I ain't coming I done heard what you said about him or hypocrite see what I'm saying your kids you will sacrifice your kids because you don't talk where did Brother Branham said that the children learned old bald head old bald head he said from the parents around the dinner table so these kids came out and they saw that old bald-headed preacher coming down the way Ayo bald headed bald head you know when Mommy and Daddy said about you and he got so vexed he called two she Bears out he said that was not God to kill those children that was an angry prophet you done pressed his button touch not mind anointed and do my Prophets no harm amen they learned it around the dinner table God help us say good things if they don't see it the way you see it and they don't agree with you so what praise God they're your brother quit all of this fussing and fighting I'm a poem of Apollos are you not carnal we're losing our Simplicity I'm trying to bring it down I just got a little bit hear more bear with me for a moment Paul said after everything has been considered all of my former learning is done I tell you what I save that I know nothing except for him Christ and crucified that's all I know he took the whole gospel and brought it to a new Jesus Christ and him crucified amen he is the sinner of every scripture he is the theme of every chapter he is the Alpha and Omega from Genesis to Revelation it's all about him and him crucified and then your relationship brother REM says and I want to just say this how can we claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and we fuss and Feud and we can't call another brother because he don't see it the way you see it you poor hypocrite brother Randolph said in 1955 where I think Pentecost failed if it ever gets to a place I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid amen if we disagree a million miles on theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and that's my sister and we've drawed those lines and if you can't you love your brother whom you have seen how can you love God whom you have not seen and brother when love goes out God goes with it amen for God is love and you can never get anywhere without Divine love and as you love one another you love God brother Rand makes a really bold statement and I love it he says God would rather have you to love one another than to love him um somebody's enjoying himself in there God would rather have you love one another than to love him because when you love one another you love him can you love the one that's sitting next to you can you love the one that maybe says all manner of evil against you that Jesus said do you only love those who love you why even the publicans do so you got public in religion you got Pharisee religion there's no reward in that love your enemy Love My Enemy oh God there's no way that I can do it myself I can't I'm human but there is a supernatural element inside of every one of us that we can forgive and we can huh love our brother love thinks no evil it's not proud puffed up love beareth all things for God is love Believers even family members will not even speak to one another because they don't agree on their opinion I was in Texas one time had a man that went to my church and his brother his physical brother in the message both of them believed in the message both of them loving the Lord both going to church both families are serving the lord in the message but one goes to one church and one another and one was the song leader of another church and because the two of them didn't agree an opinion one brother was working he needed to borrow a tool and he says hey he called his brother I forget his brother's name he said hey call me Mom Hey listen do you have one of those tools in your shed can I borrow it yeah yeah come on over come on over and get it when we were there I was with him we pulled up in the driveway in his car brother Ron you sit here I'll just go to the I'll go to the door and get it the brother look through the front door to his other brother oh it's you you can't come in I put it on the side door so go get it that's your brother happy birthday to you oh you got to be kidding me and they they would not they wouldn't they'd drive down the street and they see one another in a supermarket hey hey no no God take me home before I ever act like some religious Pharisee let me love let me love those who don't love me amen brother Branham said without Divine love you ain't gonna make it is that right watch what Paul said to the galatian church excuse me but I studied and I got this and I thought this this my last sermon I won't preach for another two and a half weeks or so Galatians 4 verses 14 through 16. and my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus Paul said you Galatians you received me even as Christ where then is the blessedness that you speak of I bear your record if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me it might therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth wow from hero to zero all men have forsaken me isn't it amazing that how quickly we lose our simplicity brother Brenham and I got a whole study series I did on disagreeing with a brother can we disagree without being disagreeable sure well he's coming on a white horse ah no he's not coming on White Cloud well who cares that's some theological discussion it really it doesn't matter it has nothing to do with your Eternal salvation musicians come this is not the scripture says though I give my body to be burned though I have all faith I can move mountains though I understand all the Mysteries you know and he says all these things and I have not loved I am sounding brass tinkling symbols and I myself might be a Castaway oh I understand the great revelation of God and you don't love your brother who disagrees with you I tell you right now you can go make it because without Divine love perfect love covers a multitude well I'll tell you you want to know about brother so-and-so you know what I think of him you know what he did pray for him that's the talking [Music] I started with the the title vein talkers unruly deceivers we put bits in horses mouths that they might obey us we put a great helm on a big ship if we can make it go where we want it to go but who can Bridle the tongue [Music] with that same tongue we can bless God and we can sing the Praises of God and turn right around and say I'm glad I'm not like him [Music] how dare we ever look down our noses or compare ourselves one to another because the Bible says measuring themselves by themselves are they which one of you are you are so holy that you look down at everybody else because they don't see it just like you it 'll be Saints that's what Paul was telling him here he come to the very first church age when Pentecost was right there just a few decades away they've seen the signs and wonders they've seen all of this and yet how quickly the enemy comes in the cares of Life choked the seed becomes unfruitful we lose our simplicity [Music] I'm not looking for all the ministers and the message to agree with me and to see it exactly the way I see it [Music] God demands that I love without dissimulation how about you [Music] are you one of those that love only those who love you that's Pharisee religion [Music] thank you we're not careful what we do is we hand pick all the preachers that we like because they agree with us so that's the only ones we have to our convention let me tell you there are the No Name little preachers that have little churches than their Ministries all over the world sometimes we miss one of the greatest blessings because he's a new name I never heard of him where's he go where is he from I love to have a cross-section and fivefold Ministry in my Pulpit whether they agree with me or not because you know what they're special gifts and they have certain viewpoints and certain certain things that they see and what amazes me I could have preached on a certain Doctrine for years and covered it but they come from a different angle here's the Evangelist brother representative evangelist with a special gift gets up there and tears it up and he's this and that I'll get people to the altar I think man I've done preached that for years and oh brother Ron thank you for having brother and so I never heard that before in my life where were you must have been the day you're sleeping you're intercessing [Music] that's good that's not only good for you it's good for me well I don't see it that way that's okay praise the Lord if we had an accident right here on Mountain View in front of the church after church and all of you was out there and you heard and you saw the accident you saw the cars spin around and the uh and the officer says was you out front did you see that accident yes I did what is your name I want to know your name your age where you're from this and that did you see the accident yes sir I did okay what did you hear I heard the this the the Screech of the tires I saw the Red Hawk car hit the white car was you there oh yes yes I was uh-huh what did you see well I saw that the white car hit the yellow car and then the red car and then I heard discrete wait a second but that's different than what he heard and you were there too oh yeah what is your name uh-huh yeah well you must be a liar because you are not seeing exactly what those two saw but you saw it and you too uh-huh and so in the midst of all of these eyewitnesses there is a truth [Music] otherwise the cop will say I'll tell you uh you're a liar because he said this and don't match you did you I thought you said you was there I what well then why don't it match exactly because
