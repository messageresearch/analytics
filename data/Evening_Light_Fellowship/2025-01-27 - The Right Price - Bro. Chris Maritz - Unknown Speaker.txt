H talk about a uh a youth Revival we'll all be about the same age amen it's going to be a glorious time God bless you I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ I wanted to take a moment and recognize this this is just impromptu and I thought I'd do this because a lot of times the church is not fully aware of who does what in our church and I would like all of our Junior and senior youth leaders their wives and their children if they can all come up here come up front right now James and Stephen and Justin Jenny uh Ethan and Hannah if you guys can all come up if you want to bring all your children and huh they're in Sunday school well go get them now I cannot overemphasize the importance of the youth leaders the time the effort that they put into speaking to our youth to organizing to having things set up to our camps and the time and now you guys your families are you've got some of you have got five children others have got a kid on the way and others you know and God has uh blessed you in many ways but the unselfishness that they have for our youth and the the time and the effort to go in to do it and to work with them uh because that is our Legacy and so I wanted to take a moment we have stepen mcney and Ashlin raise your hands so others they know uh he is uh come here from over there and overseas in uhel Ireland and uh he came over here and was at a couple meetings and youth and different things and next thing you know he comes over here and fell in love with one of our girls and we wouldn't allow him to take her back to Ireland so he had to move here and uh but uh he is also my associate Minister associate pastor here um and we're taking these young men and we're grooming letting them there's nothing any better than have our ministers to have Pulpit time that's the only way that you actually get better and so uh brother James and uh Allison raise your hand yes God bless you uh we appreciate them and Justin and Jenny dubsky and uh Ethan and Hannah stiny God bless you let me just say here before everyone here I appreciate the job you do it takes a lot of pressure off me to be able to hand it to you and say okay get her done and you do it

I'm excited to be in the house of the Lord amen amen and it's nice to see brother meno God bless you brother wow it just I feel so small here today see brother Jim and just uh the Warriors that have gone ahead of us Amen brother Ron just uh really honored to be here in your presence today and and uh you know we just want to uh bring our our lick of fire this morning amen we want to tell you about a living God Amen we want to just spend some time around his word amen and so we just want to uh invite you today to enjoy the service to relax in his presence amen he knows all about you he knows your needs amen and he has the answers for us amen isn't it good to know a god that is is living he's not a god of stone but he knows you he knows where you live amen and so we come to him this morning amen and uh as we go to the word just now I just invite you to turn in your Bibles to the book of 1 Corinthians 6 and 19 and uh we just trust that you'll be encouraged in the word today amen we bring you greetings from our your your extended family in the Pacific North West at Living Word Fellowship there and they said to make sure to extend a warm uh uh greeting to you so we say God bless you amen we're pressing the battle over there on the west coast you're pressing the battle over here amen who knows how many more services we'll have like this and what an honor it is to come together like this in this flesh in this time amen and even in our weaknesses and our our frailties we can come and praise our God we can bring glory to a living God today and uh and we have a reason to do that because we have a testimony we're a witness of the things he has done he is he is the god who when he said he he'll do something he will he does it amen and we're here to testify of that Resurrection we're here to testify of the power of God today so this morning we're going to add just another Stone we're going to add another Revelation I trust it'll be an encouragement to you we're going to speak this morning on this little thought of the right price and uh you know as we even say those words there are many things that come to our mind when we think of the right price you know uh maybe when you go purchase something there's always going to be a price attached to that object and it will be the right price now sometimes we don't like the price you know it's if it's something valuable if it's something that that is is worth something you know it's got some weight to it uh it's going to be expensive and uh we might not like that idea that it's expensive but it's the right price for that object because it has to match the the value the worth of that object so today we want to uh speak on what is this the the right price in 1 Corinthians 6:19 it says what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own and look at this next portion here in verse 20 for you are bought with a price amen therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods amen if you have a a need this morning you can let it be known with an uplifted hand we're just going to go to the Lord in prayer just at this time and Lord we just come father as we just feel so uh small in your wonderful presence today how we would just love to just sit here and just continue to Worship You Lord because Lord truly you have given us a song in our hearts thank you Lord you've given us a reason to worship you God because we see the value Lord of your word we see the value of your Holy Spirit we see the value in these things today oh God and we've come to give honor to those things Lord we've come Lord to give you praise Lord May Our Lives Lord be a sweet smelling Savor unto you and Lord I just come Lord in my in my in my Frailty Lord in my vessel today and I give you Lord the gift that you have placed in my life Lord may you use it as an instrument in your hands today as I just want to step aside Lord and you speak to your people father Lord you purchase them with your blood and may you come now and meet the needs of your people if as you saw the uplifted hands the desires that are on the hearts of your people father come and bless us in your presence today may we go from your house today saying Lord was it not good for us to be in the house of the Lord amen Lord we just give you praise now and give you thanks and come and open the word to us may we see things Lord we've never seen before may we draw something from you may we draw strength from you today Lord is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we we we thank you amen you may have your seats for a moment well praise the Lord amen we can we can just almost close just on the scripture reading today you know as the Lord says that you are bought with a price so there's a price tag attached to you you know if you and maybe looked at the bottom of the sole of your foot there would be a price tag sitting there and there would be a certain value and only the architect the designer the creator of that body would know the exact value of that life of that vessel and so each and every one of you today you know uh God has created us uniquely specifically uh we're not here by accident we're not here by chance but you have a uniqueness to you there's something about you that is that that only you can bring you know there you're a an attribute of God's thoughts of his mind when he thought of the very end of the Gentile dispensation when he thought of the end of time and and here we're sitting here this morning it's not an accident we sit here God knows your name he knows your address he knows exactly who you are and you have a certain value to his kingdom because you only you can bring a certain uh Ting a certain sound that he's looking for at the end time amen so we see even as the darkness would creep in and we see all the things that are happening in the world and the chaos and the and the Darkness and and know the the as the enemy comes in like a flood we see all these things but yet at the same time God has somebody on the scene to meet those conditions amen he has a people that will worship a people that will live a life that is exactly according to what he had in his mind and so there is a price attached to you today there's a value amen and I love how we have a cross hanging here today amen it's just something that'll be coming up later on in the but remember there was a price uh about you am mean there's a value around your life so what is the right price we can talk about prices today but you know we'll haggle and deal and we'll try and get the best price you know we'll try and and to us the best price is the cheapest price you know we got some salespeople around here and and they understand that you know when you're negotiating they'll try and find flaws they'll try and find uh uh mistakes with the with a product or maybe a a little hiccup in the system system or something and and they're doing that to try and bring the price lower amen they they really want the object but but they want to bring the price as low as they can so that they can purchase it and make it their possession but at the end of the day there is truly the right price for an object amen now the price is dictated by the object so you know uh uh the price we place on food is not the the same value or the same price we might place on a house you know the the object dictates the value of that object amen it dictates the the price and the object will set the value thus the price of that object amen so even your life it is dictated a certain value to God the price will set the purchasing power amen so why do we have prices it is so that the consumer can come and he can take possession of an item but he has to come and he has to meet the same value that that object has set you following me so far amen all the sisters are are thinking about shopping and all these things and you know they're thinking of oh I had such a great deal you know but at the end of the day my brother and sister right those objects set the price and the reason why there's a price fixed is so that you can purchase it and not just purchase it and and put it in a shelf somewhere but you can make it yours amen you can you can take possession of it it it becomes in other words it becomes of value to you when you have taken possession of it so there has to be the right price put on things the full price must be paid for you to have full possession of it so the full price needs to be met you know we can have payments on a vehicle but until the vehicle is completely paid off until the full price has been paid until the right price has been met you cannot take possession completely you can pretend it's yours you know but at the end of the day the bank really owns it right who is owning your life you know if you think about that so the whole price has to be met for the object to be whole and complete the whole price has to be met and the price will reflect the object what is required is not more or less it is the right price the transaction will be complete and for it to be complete it needs to be exactly equal to the value of the object amen so a price gives a opportunity for someone to engage in a transaction now there's got to be a way to measure it for us to know the price of something we have to have a reference point there has to be a way that we can measure it there has to be a unit of measure either in weight or in quality uh or in number quantity there has to be a way that we can measure the object to understand its full value or it full potential or to understand the price of it we have to have measuring uh units units of measure you need to be able to measure it out as we uh have here and and the brothers thank you for helping me with the slides today you know what is the right price for a 3B bag of these oranges you know these oranges they um they they are3 lbs in in a bag like that and so there's a unit of measure and what is the right price for the weight of those oranges you know according to this website it's $4.98 that's on a special by the way now I'm not here to advertise so I'm not going to tell you which store this is in we might have some people leaving right away but this is the the right price for the weight of those oranges now those oranges were not always that weight right they they had to mature they were in seed form first but at the end of the day they they mature to this place where they come to the full weight or the full value of what they're intended for what their purpose is and at the right time in the right season the right place the pl the price will be right and then you can purchase that and it can be of use to you amen now everybody's thinking about lunch now brother Bram tells the story of of the the loaf of bread you know and he said how that you can have 25 cents in your pocket and he says that is as good as is if you have the loaf of bread that's like our faith so so the price the right price for that loaf of bread is05 cents now if you have the 25 cents you have the purchasing power for that loaf of bread in other words it's equal unto the possession of that bread amen 25 cents though it may look different it'll it'll it'll act differently it'll have different sounds if you drop it you know it'll have different weight but if you compare it to the loaf of bread the loaf of bread looks different from the outside amen but yet there's an equal point there they are valued the same right The Price is Right now let's look at the creation because remember everything is measurable everything has a weight everything has a design for a purpose for a reason so when God created the heavens and the Earth it was so that we can have units of measure it is so that we can understand a living God in Genesis 1:14 it says God said let there be lights in the firment of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years so so God you know he he's he's there and and he's in eternity and with all his thoughts and everything but there was no way to worship God Amen there was no way to know God until that invisible becomes visible and so he starts to create and and by the spoken word he starts to lay things out now remember he's not just halfhazard you know saying this should be green and and this over here should be like a tree and you know just you know halfhazard Le no there's a whole ecosystem out there everything is weighed out just right everything you know if you think of the the placing of the Moon and the Sun and the magnetic fields and everything has got to be exactly right exactly weighted and and measured out just to the te you know that the as he says he'll he's put lights in the firmament for what reason so we can measure a day isn't that amazing God creating lights in the heavens so that we as as mere mortals here on this Earth we can understand and we can start to see that there's time and there's something in motion there's a purpose to this earth amen why because there's a price there's a value on this Earth so God starts to set units of measure so that we can quantify the creation of God we can start to understand this this God and whom we have to do with right amen so for signs for seasons and and you can imagine as as the first you know second would tick away and then the next Second and then before you know it was 60 seconds and and now we have a minute you know all these new names and and New Revelations of of Time start to manifest itself and and then before you know it a day passes and and and you know what if you if you pay attention out there you'll notice the sun you know nobody nobody uh was worried about the Sun Rising today it's fixed there by the laws of God so that we can measure the time of day you know we know what time it is now we know at 10:00 we're going to start church today and we know all these things why because God has created units of measure so we can value these things amen so God has a purpose when he creates something time was set into motion God creating time to measure time and all these things so that we can value a day Genesis 1:16 goes on and says and God made two great lights now he's becoming more specific the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth there's the the very purpose of that light is to give light amen so God doesn't like I said he doesn't just uh you know it's not just for decoration he's got a plan he's got a purpose and as he has a plan and purpose he's the Creator those lights by the way do exactly what they're called to do right you know they don't you know decide well I'm tired of being a star I'm just going to go be the moon right we don't see chaos like that out there in God's creation no everything is weighted and it's for a purpose for a specific reason so it gives light in in upon the Earth and in verse 18 and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good he's pleased with his Creation The Price is Right the value is being set it's being fixed in the evening and the morning were the fourth day we start measuring days how many days if you think about it have we come along and see the seen the creation of God fixed and and uh and and moving along by the law by the very nature of of God Amen so God set the the laws in motion setting the measurements in place in order that we may know and understand an eternal God how will we understand who he is unless he gives us something to measure it by now we notice quickly that everything is created with a specific function now think of your own life amen you were created you have a Creator amen we did not put ourselves here that somebody created us amen we we were we have a Divine architect behind our lives the the footsteps of the or of the righteous order of the Lord amen so we each have a a function just like the sun has a function the moon has a function everything has a a specific purpose in the great scheme the great plan of God and will have a specific value your life has a value on it now the moon and the sun were placed in a specific places up there in the heavens each object having a specific purpose each one playing their part amen what about your part this morning amen now Colossians 1:16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven amen that's everything right and are in Earth notice this here visible and invisible amen now you can trust that the things that you see in the visible you know if he is so detailed and he's so careful about the things in the in the visible realm how much more can we trust him for the things in the invisible realm now whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things somebody say all things all things all things amen we're created by Him now that's easy you know by him we can we can see that part but notice the next part here there's two parts here right by him and for him so let's just let's just cover this right now amen everything that he has created everything that he has created is for his purpose that's right so he set the value on everything he placed it he has a purpose he has a calling he has a design for everything praise the Lord and he is above all things and by him all things consist praise the Lord that should just bring a peace to our lives amen it should relax us thank you Lord You Are My Creator you have fixed everything my even my days are numbered the very hairs of my head are numbered praise the Lord amen so everything is measured everything has a season a Time amen now let's move forward a little bit everything is created by Him and for him him for his purpose everything yes even evil was made for him and I know this is where people get a little hiccup you know like really but God created everything I'd rather that evil be in his hands that it be in somebody else's hands amen because then it's measured and it has a value to it and it can only last so long and he has measured that out amen and that means that it will have a season a time and it will end amen so God is even in control of those things in Isaiah 45 just to be very clear about this in verse 5 he says I am the lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I GED thee though thou Hast not known me that thou that they may know from the rising of the Sun in the in other words when they witness these things the the motion of these things as the sun rises they will start to understand who God is so that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I I am the lord and there is none else amen now watch this next part he says I form the light and I create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things so let's just like I said we want to just have a really strong Foundation this morning as we go forward into the service he has done all these things so everything in our lives is is orchestrated by God Amen even the hardships we go through the the good times the bad times God is in in all of those things he is behind every move he is omnipresent he is all knowing god god do not make a mistake in in birthing you in the family you were birthed in you did not make a mistake in in the things that happened in your life you might have lost a loved one you might have gone through a hard trial or or some hard knocks in life but God is in control of all those things amen amen amen because God is looking for the right price out of your life he is looking for the right thing the right expression to come from your life and he knows how to use all these things as instruments in his hands to bring you to the right place so at the right time you're the weight will be the right weight and the price will be the right price and there will be a Harmony between those things praise the Lord praise the Lord now all these things were created so that we can understand or measure the invisible things amen it's hard to understand an invisible God but you know he created all these things that we see around us today every everywhere we look the trees the the cactus the you know even this in this room here the people mothers and fathers and and children and and even this water sitting here everything is speaking is a expression of the invisible realm amen now like Moses was told to build the Tabernacle remember he had to go into to Heavenly places he went up on the mountain God took him away and he showed him the pattern that is in heaven and he said go and make this what you see here in heaven in other words in eternity and it's another dimension there's a replica there was a there's a an expression in the Unseen amen that that God took a prophet up into and he brought him up in the presence of the Lord and he showed him in the Unseen World he showed him the patterns and he showed him the measurements of the Tabernacle and he says what you see here go and build it on the earth so now he's There's Something Happening Here God is showing that that there's a reflection there's a whatever is happening on Earth is pointing back to the invisible realm and it has to be exactly the same you know you look at the details that God uh designed that Tabernacle with and the kind of skins and the kind of wood and the amount of gold that had to be used and the colors and the curtain and the placing of things why was he specific about the things because it has to be weighed exactly the same way it's weighed out in heaven the measurement has to be the same why because it's a reflection of the Unseen things and so when they see that Tabernacle you know a lot of people they would maybe pass by that Tabernacle in the wilderness and they would say man these Israelites are crazy you know look at this Tabernacle it's it's what is that all about what's the the smoke coming out of the the back room there for and what is the the the Brazen Altar and what are they doing over there but you know the people that were in the in the will of God and in the plan of God they saw something else Moses had Revelation he had understanding and and he was playing out a a mystery that would happen out in the future Church ages amen amen God tabernacling himself amongst men and here he has a a a a unit of measure he has something on the earth testifying of what is already taking place in Heavenly places there's this interesting comparison throughout the scriptures of the Unseen things to the seen things now just think for a moment here we are and we can see with these eyes around this room right amen we're all on the same Planet here anybody that's not like that stand up please identify yourself but we are we are here we can see and I wonder what do we see what do we see look around this room look at one another what do you see because everything in the visible was created to show us what is in the invisible so we start to see something we start to see a comparison a measurement between the invisible and the visible world what we see with our Naked Eyes is an expression of what we cannot see like God created a set of scales you know if you think about it like this God creating a set of scales so that we we can weigh out the Unseen to the seen we can measure out we can weigh out and what we see on this side of the scale have you ever seen those old scales right on this side of the scale you put some weights here and then on this side of the scale you you put an object and you try and balance the scales right you want to balance the scales why so that it's equal across now in the middle of the scale if we can just pretend today that that's a curtain of time in the middle of the scale we we cannot see past that curtain of time but beyond that curtain is a mystery and so on this side we we cannot see what's on that side but on this side we go through experiences and things happen and and things transpire and we go through these amazing incredible an adventure if we can say it like that with God and our walk with the Lord but at the and all this time there's something that is that is being weighed out on this side and the Lord knows what it needs to be uh according to the measurement of this side over here now there's a Hiser because we cannot see it amen but on this side God is refining he is is molding he fashioning so that it will be exactly equal with what's on the other side of the scale oh my we start to see something here a mystery of of how God is is working in our lives he's working in everything to bring a Harmony bring a balance to the scales to bring it to the right price we cannot see everything we cannot understand everything but we know that God is working everything together for our good amen everything has a value so in Psalms 19:1 it says the heavens declare the glory of God and we're going to move forward here a little bit the heavens declare the G glory of God in other words they they testify they are shouting from the hilltops if you can say it like that they are there are a witness of the value of God the glory of God now when we use this word Glory we're going to look at this a little bit today the the word Glory when we think of it we think of Pomp and majesty and all these things and all those things are correct but we're going to go a little deeper into this word the glory of God because it's not just a halfhazard like fireworks going off and then it's all over no the glory of God is something Eternal amen it is weighed out so the heavens declare they are fixed and they and they are literally telling us who God is they the heavens when we look at the sun we look at the moon and the stars and the sky they are declaring who God is we can measure God by the things we see in the heavens and that's why the heavens are so vast we don't even have the the technology great enough to reach the edge of the universe we cannot see far enough we we're designing Rockets to try and get us to the moon and all these things you know the the technology that we are trying to create on Earth why because we want to measure the value the the price tag of the heavens but the heavens declare the glory of God Amen they declare his value so everything is speaking of him and the firmament showeth his handywork so the heavens Express they are the visible of the invisible and hanging there by the word of God put there placed there by the word of God what a statement if you think of the heavens declaring the glory of God God the heaven showing making known explaining or revealing the mystery of who God is if you ever have a question about the godhead just look up in the sky how many suns are there how many great lights are there about it amen there's no question about it God has written his Bible the the the the whole expression of the of the universe signify who God is the heavens tell the story of the Unseen God in other words the heavens portray or manifest the mystery of God that's why the Bible is a reflection of what we see in the heavens so the heavens have a purpose amen what do we see then in the heavens in 1 Corinthians 15 and 40 now in the New Testament the the they go into greater detail Paul picks these things up and he's and he's now going to go into greater detail about what do we see in the heavens and and there's a lengthy scripture here but I'm just going to highlight a few scriptures you can go read this chapter in your own time he says there are also celes Ral bodies and bodies terrestrial in other words there are objects in the heaven and there are objects on Earth there are objects that are Earthbound there are objects that are heavenbound and then he says but the glory of the celestial is one here's that word Glory again so he's saying that the celestial the heavenly bodies or objects have a glory right and the glory of the terrestrial is another now it's distinctly saying that the the glory of the Earthly one is different it looks different amen like the trees don't look like the stars they look different their glory is different in verse 41 it says there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon amen the Moon is not the same even though it gives light it is not its own light that it gives like the sun the sun gives its own light it's the source of light amen it's the bringer of life it's the what warms the Earth amen like the presence of God warms this room here amen it's it's the that's the lifegiver the moon does not have that ability has its own function in other words it has its own glory and so it doesn't do that it reflects the greater light and brings light in the evening time but all these things are a story of what is in the invisible specific bodies like the sun moon telling us about the the Sun how God is is is is the great husband and and the and the Moon is the bride and you know you know we know all these types and shadows but so the point here today is that the the the each body has a specific Glory each body has a specific function in other words it has a value and that value is the right price for what is in the invisible amen they express the glory of God while having their own Glory the sun is a type of God the bright shining light the Moon is a type of the bride of Christ now remember as they express the glory of God they to have their own Glory so there's a glory of God that's being expressed which is the mystery from The Unseen but at the same time they have their own Glory even in this temporal world you know your body has a has a certain function has a certain Glory you know God would never be known as a Healer unless he used your body to show that he is a Healer so your body even in this temporal condition has a glory to it the glory of these bodies amen you know we're so excited about the new bodies coming but don't miss the value of what you have right here today God using your life using your body to do what to signify or Express the Unseen God Amen how has God made Mis visible in our midst here today he's using your body so your body has a glory like the Moon it reflects the bright and Shining Light am Hallelujah it has a value it has a price on it yes amen and only you can bring that kind of value can bring that Glory declare the glory of God so the sun plays its part and comes into full view amen as as the day progresses the seconds tick away all those measurements God put in place so that we can understand a living God we see a visible expression of a living God at the very moment where the sun comes to its full brightness you know it is perfectly equal to the invisible God it is like God isn't that amazing there's a moment where everything in creation comes to its full manifestation that's right and it's equal with God because it's a full expression there's a moment where everything is in Harmony and the expression is the invisible God being made flesh in the message things that are to be brother brandham says now they only express that there's a greater of the same kind all these temporal things trees our bodies you know he he talks about the trees struggling for life he says it only signifies that there's a greater one on the other side amen that the one that doesn't die amen the tree of life and so he says because these are the same kind the likeness all these things that he did expresses the things that are to come Ju Just as the body gives you here just as this body he gave you to live in only expresses that there is one that is greater amen Yet to Come praise the Lord for that amen amen so these bodies here Express something you know the the Bible talks it's such beautiful scriptures how he talks about this body has has borne the image of the Earthly you know this body is literally the expression it is the the the the manifestation of the Earthly image and it expresses what right it's showing that there is coming another image as we are expressing the image of as we are born here on Earth we express the Earthly image we will also Express the Heavenly image amen thank you Lord 1 Corinthians 1549 says and we have come to we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly there's a here's this once again on on both sides of the scale we have this invisible uh uh expression image amen now it's it's something that's already there I've gone to prepare a place for youen if this Earthly T Tabernacle be dissolved I have one already amen it's there it's it's waiting so we have this comparison so on this side while we go through our experiences and everything everything is pointing to this heavenly one here is that amazing you know we don't just walk around this world halfhazard everything is expressing the Unseen realm you're an ambassador for the kingdom of [Music] heaven so let's take a quick look at this word Glory Isaiah 40 and3 says the voice of him that crith in the wilderness we love these scriptures amen God is is preparing the way for for him to come on the scene he's going to have a prophet again on the scene to do what to point to him right where the expression is going to be amen cuz why there has been a price there's been a measurement there's been a value that has been established before the found found of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so it's already been measured out and now Through the Ages and Through Time what happens prophets come on the scene and they start to prophesy of one who is coming amen what are they doing they're pointing to the weight of measurement that is on the in the Unseen realm but there has to be the other side of the scale there has to be in the in the living side in the in the side where time is ticking away there has to be a fulfillment of those things to meet or to come into harmony with what was in the mind of God so he has a Prophet come on the scene to do what to point out the measurement to point out where he is where that expression is taking place amen so that we can recognize Heaven and Earth is is here there's a Harmony the right price is about to be paid and there will be a Harmony there will be a possession amen there will be a like an inheritance that God brings to the earth a fulfillment of his promise he says go prepare ye the way way of the Lord Mak straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and I love the scripture and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed the glory here's that word Glory again the glory of the Lord shall be revealed Amen in The Invisible we've got it on the scales there right now remember time is in the middle so we can't see past the curtain of time but on on the other side in the Unseen there's this prophecy about a lamb right amen there's the lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world we already know you know in the Unseen God already knows who that's going to be he has a name amen and he has a certain time that he's going to come you know that is the God has created that land for a purpose that's right a virgin birth all these things you know even in Genesis there's a prophecy of the crushing the the the Serpent's head right but in this side remember now we've got glory on this side because it's saying that the glory of the Lord shall be revealed so in other words the value of God the expression the fullness of his value the fullness of his measurement will come right and you will see it and you will know him because he'll be measurable amen oh you think of God stepping down and cond descending down to earth and and making himself known and fitting into every scripture fitting into every measurement and every T is crossed and ey is dotted and you think of how God Is So in control to bring all those scriptures you know 300 plus scriptures I think it's even 600 scriptures that came to manifestation came to full measurement came to its fullness in the time of Jesus Christ amen him coming down and taking up all those things to do what to to balance the scales so there's a glory in the Unseen remember it has its own look even though we cannot see it amen it has a glory it has a function it has a value and expression but on this side there's a glory in the visible realm and the glory of this realm the glory of that realm have to match has to be the right exact right price amen praise the Lord so the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it in John 1:14 now we're going to jump forward where this is manifested amen we we know John 1:1 really well but I want to skip forward to John 114 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld in other words now this is the Fulfillment of that we beheld we see we can quantify we can we can see the value amen we can see the glory or the full weight of that prophecy now when they looked you know maybe they were surprised I thought he was going to come you know in the clouds and and bring a whole Legion of angels with him and he was going to defeat the Romans and and free us from our bondage and oppression and all these things but remember he comes in the exact value that is in the Unseen amen he cannot deviate from that he does nothing unless the father shows him first in other words what's playing out in the Unseen the vision of the word that is playing out the the the characters the drama the script that is playing out in the Unseen it has to come into harmony with with the flesh realm with this seen realm and here he is and God showing has power over all these things that here's a Son of God that can walk in harmony with the mind of Christ the firstborn of many Brethren a new race that is in harmony that can that can come and and and signify the very glory of God those things that are Mysteries those things that are unseen they can pick those things up and they can literally let it be expressed through their flesh the mystery of God in flesh so what did this Glory look like it was Jesus Christ you know they criticized him they mocked him they made fun of him they they you know they pushed pushed them aside it doesn't matter he had to come exactly exactly according to the word he had to it's amazing how God can hone all those things in and he walks exactly in the vision that is in the Unseen amen and thus we beheld his glory you start to see what this word Glory means we beheld his value we see the expression what was in the Mind Of God what was in the Unseen now we can see it we beheld the glory that's right Glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we actually see him now it doesn't matter that everybody understands it does not matter that everybody accept the way God does things but God is held by those rules amen that he whatever he expresses in the visible is to show what is in the invisible realm that's how God works that's his PR Exodus 19:10 says and it came to pass and Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel that they looked toward the Wilderness and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud we can spend a lot of time just just on this one subject here because remember the cloud is also a form amen it is a what is a cloud it's the veil of Heaven that's what the clouds do I know you guys don't get a lot of clouds here so let me explain in in British Columbia brother Jim not amused Amen in British Columbia we get these clouds and you literally cannot see the sun you cannot see the heavens why it's a veil for heaven right right so it has a glory it has a it has a value it expresses something that is in the invisible right but when you see it we know that those things have come in harmony the invisible has has married has merged with the visible oh my we'll leave that for another day the glory of the cloud what a sermon behold the glory of the cloud the of the Lord appeared in the cloud amen a cloud expressing the glory or the weight or the expression of God now this word Glory when we look it up in the in the Strong's Dictionary the word Glory here it is it is properly as they say properly in English it is to mean wait we i g HT wait something that is made heavy so the word Glory when we think of the glory of the Lord we think of of the glory that we beheld of him and and all these things and and the glory of the celestial the glory of the terrestrial and the glory of these bodies we think of a weight that is on a scale balanced and weighed out in another place in the strong it says it is to be heavy to make weighty you know you can have a weight on this side of the scale but if you want it to be balanced on this side you got to make it the right weight to be made weighty you know the scripture comes to my mind that we are we are changed from Glory unto Glory you see it's not just like a pump and a big demonstrations and it's not just that amen we praise God for the the demonstrations of God and the signs that follow them that believe and I'm not against those things amen we praise God for those things but remember that the being changed from Glory unto glory is is the weight you know that we have in our lives the the value that we have in our life God is constantly fashioning that weight and adding one brick to another line upon line precept upon precept and we're being fashioned by the Divine architect why do we go through those fiery furnaces and the trials of Our Lives why my brothers and sisters to make that weight measure come into harmony come into balance with what's in the Unseen because there's an image of you on the in the Unseen your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life there's the real you on the inside and God is fashioning that God is working it out amen and and and making it so that it weighs what is in his book balancing the scales the right price praise the Lord Revelations 21:24 says and the nation of them which are saved shall walk in the light light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it they bring their tribute or they bring their measured wealth amen 2 Corinthians 4:17 says for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory you start to see this picture now like on balances amen when weighing it out and the temporary things that we Face here cannot even be put on the scale it cannot even be compared to what God is working in your life because there's another scale God is fashioning you he making you amen thank you Lord praise the Lord everything remember evil and good using it to Fashion you and make you way just right Exodus 28:2 says and thou shalt make holy garments for Aon and thy brethren for Glory and for beauty so even in the garments of Aaron they were made for what for Glory now if you look at his garments you know maybe we we would say Well they're not really flashy or anything like that so that word Glory again it does not necessarily mean that what it means is it is weighted exactly to how we have a Heavenly priest amen so the the garments of Aaron as the high priest over the temple and those things and His function as a priest he was an example on Earth of what was happening in the heavenlies that we have a high priest of our confession that the our names are written on his in his heart right here where the the the breastplate is of that the urum Thum and all those things the supernatural light that high priest signified the weight that is in the Unseen realm balancing out the Unseen and the seen Jesus Christ then came to pay the price of redemption remember it had to be the right price and brother brandham spends a lot of time talking about the kinsman redeemer and and how he has to be in the right position to be able to pay the right price for Redemption he had to be in the right position amen he had to be a Kinsman right he had to be made flesh dwell Among Us amen for the right price to be paid he had to be willing amen amen he had to be willing in other words nobody else could do this but him there's no man found in heaven or earth that could do this amen he was the only one the right price required that one person at the right time in the right season would meet the requirement of God Amen and it and it literally says that he drank the full wrath the full wrath and he said on the cross it is finished you know it's amazing that cross even looks like scales balancing Out Heaven and Earth to bridge a gap for us amen so we can come in harmony with God where we're not enemies with God anymore but we can be called his friend prise amen but look at how he he came to Earth and he had to go through sufferings and trials he had to be rejected he had to go through all those things why because the right price had to be met couldn't be just whatever price you know God could have brought an army down he could have wiped off all these things he could have just you know set us free he could have done whatever he wanted to but the right price had to be paid the full price had to be met and so the process begins it required the blood of a spotless lamb he had to be Kinsman he had to be born of a virgin each and every penny if we could say it like that being added to that scale because it's weighing out against the Unseen the very mystery that's in God's mind the plan of God his grace his love his Redemption Story the whole thing that's in his mind he is letting it play out on this side adding precept upon precept Penny upon Penny wait upon wait until finally Jesus Christ comes into the fullness of what he was called to be so that he could be the right price he could pay the right price for our Redemption amen each and every penny had to be met even though he had great signs and wonders you know if you think of this Jesus Christ in his ministry he had Great Signs there was many wonders in his ministry and great things that happened people were healed delivered uh even raised from the dead dead amen but even at that even through all that we could say well that's amazing praise God for his presence we see the glory of God that was not the full glory of God do you see what I'm saying the full value of him was not just in the signs and in the Wonders and the healings and the demonstrations it was not just in those things that's part of it but he has to meet the full measurement he has to come to the full glory and God uses things in in his environment in his in his proximity to bring him to that full value now we love the signs I mean we those things are easy we love worshiping we love the good things of God the blessings of God but my brother and sister it does not bring us to the full Glory of our life we need everything he created everything for this purpose amen the good and bad in our lives to bring us to the full measurement the full expression there came a time when Jesus Christ had to be betrayed and it's amazing that when he was betrayed we see these words in John 13-31 he says therefore when he was gone speaking of Judas Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him in other words you know the healings were amazing all these things were great but now when when he comes to the very purpose of his calling the very purpose of his expression the very purpose of why he came to the earth now he's coming to the fullness of it and it doesn't matter my brother and sister all these things you know the seasons change times change all these things change why because it has to come to its full measurement God had to go to a cross and to do that he had to have someone betray him amen he had to have the Roman government there to bring oppression bring people in from around the world and and and and so that Mary would come to to the right place at the right time everything had to be orchestrated for uh by God for him amen why because the price had to be met the balances would have to the scales would have to be balanced and so we find God coming on the scene he he has the Romans there he has everything playing out exactly to his plan there are tools and instruments in his hand to do what to bring the right weight of Glory from his life and yes it was hard it was not easy how he was rejected he was falsely accused he was brought through the Hall of critics he had to go through all those things why my brother and sisters because that would be the full measure of his glory that even in the hard times there was a strength there was a power that that would bring about the purpose of God in his life if we can say it like that nothing could defeat the purpose of God I mean it' be easy to have a to have a victory it would be easy to have glory and all these things in the good times but my brother and sister it's not the full picture amen he is showing to us that even in the dark times even in the hardships in those things he brings glory to himself nothing can defeat the purpose of God and there we find him being betrayed amen people that were in his midst people that were around him betraying him and what does he do he has to go to the Cross yeah why because the scales have to balance amen that's what he was created for in the very Mind Of God he was the slain lamb before the foundation of the world he had to come to this full picture oh if he you know he knew what he was there for my brother and sister and and if you think of him coming to The Garden of Gethsemane even you think of the character of Christ there in the garden even there he he knows this is the requirement he knows what's laying ahead and even in that body in that frail human body like we have here today he recognizes this is a hard thing and the blood separates from from his sweat like this and and you know it it goes into a a a state of of of pain and hurt and anguish but he had to go through those motions why because there was an image in The Invisible realm that that only he could play out nobody else could do what he did nobody else could could pay the price for our Redemption he is the only one that could meet the right price to meet the requirement of God to come to the fullness of the glory of God in his life praise the Lord oh Don't Fear The hardships Don't Fear the hard times God is using it as a tool as a fashion tool to to bring you to the full Glory that he has written of you you and nobody else can write that can play out that part nobody else can be that character in the story thank you Lord now can the son of man be glorified now can the full weight be measured Quantified and when he hung on that cross he said it's finished scales went click yeah and the onlooker said the requirements been met amen Jesus Christ said I come in the fullness in the volume of the book that is written of me he was walking in the vision of the prophecies he was walking in the vision the words of the prophets he was walking in the volume of the book that was written of him he he knew what the Unseen World had a picture of him of and he could walk in that Vision you know God has let us look beyond the curtain of time he let us look at the other side of the scales and he see and we see ourselves walking in the vision of the word going into a Rapture that's already been written it's already been played out so we come the same way we say we come in the volume of the vision amen we come in the volume of the book why because on that side of the scale it's been weighed out in this life no matter what I have to go through no matter the hardships no matter the mountaintops The Valleys no matter the things that come by my way God is more than able to make me weigh the right kind of value so that I can be in harmony with the vision amen oh it's exciting almost huh because I want to hear those scales click huh and at that moment when they clicked what happened my brother and sister the veil was rent into two and the temple and the Earth shook amen the whole place is going through a convulsion amen why because something was happening Heaven and Earth was was coming together the the the weights have been met the the the requirement had been met the price have been paid the right price amen and everything was in harmony with the will of God oh you think he can stop the plan of God in your life you think he can stop the purpose of God playing out in your life you know the devil tried it with Daniel he tried it with the Hebrew children he did all those things that he could do to them we look at all the martys throughout the ages my brother and sister nothing can stop the purpose of God from being weighed out in your life and it will meet every little ounce and you might say why do I go through this financial trouble why do I have this trouble in my family God is weighing out the ounces you know we're at we're at a time where he's just you know sanding a little bit here and he puts it on the scale and he says oh it's so beautiful so close just going to scuff a little bit here and just a little bit of sanding here we're going to get into the finer sandpapers now why because we're getting to those very last few Strokes one of these days the scales will balance and we'll take another step and we will not belong here anymore because we'll be one the bridge would have been Gap the Gap would have been bridged amen praise the Lord Brother Braham says when he seen that creation had fallen in the message identification I'm not sure if I have that on the slides sorry brother now his own loving character molded himself into that very person of Christ he says God's own character of Love projected himself in the man Christ as Paul speaking here thinking of not robbery making himself equal to God making himself equal he fashioned himself he he he he walked in the way that would make him equal with God you know Enoch walked that way he walked with God and was not see his own character molded that kind of a person character character the character of Christ amen there was a value on this side of the scale and it was called the character of God the character of Christ and then in this character if we had to examine his character we would find a loving God a god of Grace a god of Mercy the Lamb of God a merciful god this is the character of God one who was able to meet the requirement of the Judgment of God Amen this is the character now on this side what is what does the bible teach us that he learned obedience amen amen why because there's a character on this side so on this side he he made himself he allowed himself to be molded into this character he was it was the right price for this character he had to be molded subjected to things Amen to do what to learn obedience to in other words to come into harmony with the weight of the of the scale in other words he counted the cost he knew what was required how is he measured we look at at another quote here in the message here him he says God's searching for real man I don't know how big his muscles are men are never judged by his muscles men are judged by character amen I've seen men that weigh 200 lb and solid muscle and don't have an ounce of man in him but man is measured by character there was never a man like Jesus Christ and the Bible said there was no Beauty we would desire him but a character so when we're talking about the glory of God we beheld his glory it wasn't that he was this amazing you know uh uh uh Angelic being and you know all the wasn't like that he was a humble human being God wrapped in in a veil like that Tabernacle in the wilderness wrapped in obscurity and and and and veiled from from the the wise and and The Prudent amen he was there in a mystery form but there he was and it was nothing that men would desire him he was not beautiful in that way way but what was the glory of him it was the character of Christ being manifested in his life amen there had never been a man like Jesus Christ the Bible said there's no Beauty we should desire him but a character like it has never been molded that's right hear ye him Revelations 3:18 says now as we just take another little turn here today Revelations 3:18 we know the scripture well this is our scripture right Angel unto the leans what does he say here what does he admonish the church that is in the lean Church age what does he admonish them to do he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire here we have this weight again a value gold is one of the most precious medals we have it is something of great value that thou mayest be rich now remember this this idea of being rich here is not rich in wealth in worldly wealth but there's there's something we can be wealthy in amen even right now we can be wealthy in this gold amen buy of me gold and if you look at the wording here to buy of me gold that means that there's a transaction taking place amen if I'm reading this correctly everybody reading the same scripture as me right to buy which means that there's a transaction taking place which means that there will be an object there will be something to purchase and there will be a purchaser or a consumer that will have the right uh Goods that will have the right um pennies right will have the right uh resources to do what to purchase what's on that side he'll be able to purchase this so this gold that he's saying come buy of me gold it's an invitation come and buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire amen that's tried in the fire so what is this now this is just briefly here we're not going to spend a lot of time on this but this goal that he's talking about is the character of Christ amen it's character it is and that is that is something of value it's got a price to it it's got the right price to it amen and and now if he's saying come buy of me gold that means that in his mind in the Unseen right in the mystery form he's got something on the scales this is for each and every one of you for each and every one of you there's a scale sitting in front of you on the other side of the scale in the Unseen there's a character there's a gold that has been weighed out for you for your life amen and it's called the character the Christlike character and he's saying to you today come and buy of me in other words you can have a transaction you can make a purchase today and purchase you can TR have a transaction where you can take this for the right price amen for the right price you can receive this amen and take possession of this and make it yours am amen now brother Brown says this in the message saman Church age is from this um Church age book he says James 1 2 to 4 he says my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse Temptations praise the Lord amen everybody's excited about those things but remember now we're looking at this differently because that's Glory that's waiting there for us that's weight that's gold nuggets that's you know we need to start looking at things differently amen there's ounces of gold there waiting for you am man if we put some ounces of gold out here in the front and I said hey this is freely available you if you decide that you want some of this you can have it everybody would just stay in their seats right no no way it's free it's it's available come and make a transaction amen come and and and take a hold of it make it yours amen so so look at this here he's saying this these temptation are those nuggets of gold it's it's the it's the it's got value to it knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing in other words that you can reach the full weight of Glory concerning your life the full weight of Glory this is the transaction remember we can't buy character like we do at the grocery store right you tell me if you if you see some I would love to to know about it amen but you can't you can't buy love you can't buy those attributes of God at a grocery store so how do we purchase these things there's the hint there Temptations trials the things that try our faith is working something to perfect us to bring us to the full weight that has been measured of you H Prophet says why does he stand by you know through our trials and through the sufferings it feels like he's just standing off to the side he doesn't hear us or doesn't know about it Lord do you see what I'm going through why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:1 1718 and if children then heirs Heirs of God joint HS with Christ and if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us so there's a glory there's a weight there's a value amen like I said there's a price tag on you that God knows about he put it there and there's a glory there's a weight from The Unseen that is going to be made visible in your life yes now how do we get there how do we get to this point where we can come to the place where we know God we have a relationship with God and we can walk in the fullness of the things he's called us to unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory it's not a gift so God knows that we're going to purchase this gold that's tried in the fire it's not a gift this is something we fight for this is something we wrestle it out with like Jacob he could never be who he was unless he came and and remember remember the scripture says that that you cannot see the glory of God and live that's what the scripture said you cannot see him face to face you cannot see him for who he is you cannot see the full measure of God you cannot stand in his reflection and live and so people thought that you know if you saw God you would die but you know Jacob he could never fully come to the full weight of Glory of his life unless he came face to face with God in other words he cannot see God he cannot see the glory of God see the manifestation of God and ever live the same way again because your life is being changed it's being changed from one weight to another Jacob as he was wrestling it out with the angel amen wrestling it out with God a human being wrestling it out with a Heavenly creature can you imagine what's taking place the the scales are are being balanced amen wrestling it out with God lord what have you called me to Lord I need your strength Lord I need to what what what is your purpose concerning me is wrestling it out with God maybe one of you here today want to wrestle it out with God lord I want to see the other side of the scale what have you called me to what's my purpose in this walk I feel different I feel funny or maybe don't fit in whatever it may be remember there's a price upon your life there's a value and only you can bring that yes very good he wrestles it out and what happens he his name is changed the Lord touches his walk he walks differently becomes a prince with God he what was happening a transaction was taking place you know he was a Shyer before he was just a little deceiver running away from his problems afraid of his brother and all these things and you know the the the mess and the chaos of his life this was the character of of Jacob but it was not what God had written about him there was a story about about how how Jacob would become Israel and how he would walk with God like a prince like a ruler with God Amen and even though it did not look like that at this time in his life he looked like a failure looked like a weakness God knew exactly how to Fashion that gold because he says come and buy of me gold in other words come and have a transaction come make a purchase and how did he make that purchase through a life experience through the experiences of Jacob's life he was being fashioned he was purchased sing unto himself Revelation weights of gold adding unto his stature in that way praise the Lord until the time where the the scales would be balanced completely you think you think Jacob would ever regret going through those experiences God called them to no sir because the revelation of who he is in Christ that he's a part of something he's a part of the Eternal plan of God he's part of the Redemption plan he's part of God am huh you cannot Escape God he he he's not going to you know be a a half God or a partial God he's going to have every weight accounted for every joint every member will be there character is a victory amen so when you go through trials and things and you go through mind battles and games and things you know the devil knows how to play games right that's right but the Lord's using him to do what he knows the value that's in your life might be why am I going through this trial again why am I suffering like this why because he sees the value and you know we should just stand back and say Lord this is happening I I recognize something's happening here something's taking place let me not get caught up carnally let me not react carnally but Lord let me let me look past the curtain of time let me walk with you Lord through this Valley let me see what it is that's sitting on the other side of the scale you know you mothers that that that maybe have lost the children or maybe your children are in the world you know the prophet talks about how we go into the resurrection and we come and sit at that table on Mother's Day He says that'll be the greatest Mother's Day on that day all the scales will be balanced amen and he'll show to you why you went through the things you went through on this side of the world of this side of the of time of the curtain of time he says he will put his fingers into your mind and and unwrap all those knots all those questions you have for why this had to happen why this took place and why this trial here and he will show you the plan of God on that day the scales will be balanced on that day the full weight of Glory of of your life will be shown on that day why and I have to go through this why do I have to face cancer why do I have to face these things in my life because God has a weight of Glory he sees you on the other side of the scale and he says you are more than able through through me my grace is sufficient for you just keep walking keep walking with me can put your hand in mine you can trust me cuz I'm working I'm fashioning something in your life that only you can bring nobody else can bring that sound that Ting that I'm looking for only you you have a price and he knows how to bring the value of that price in your life life thank you Jesus oh there's so many things but let me just let me close with the story of Jonathan is that all right Jonathan the prince what an incredible character you know I I think often of of Jonathan you know he's not one of the the characters that you hear preached about a lot you know nobody preaches about Jonathan right Saul's son you know he he comes to such a interesting end you know it it looks so bad it looks so like ah like a tragedy you know but to me the the character of Jonathan it really speaks to me you know there is Jonathan he's the next in line to be king right let's face the facts here he's the next in line to be king he he works with his father and his father King Saul he goes through his own struggles we're not going to talk about Saul today right but you know he went through his own struggles and yet he played out the purpose of God okay but look at how God used Saul in in Jonathan's life Jonathan you know he had to come to the right place at the right time for something to be said about his life and David you know with the with the Eyes Like an Eagle he looks at that scene there when they when they died on that hill and what does David declare right right in the end they were not divided there's this it's an interesting phrase in the end they were not divided they were like eagles like Swift Eagles this is the testimony that David gives this is when he looks at the life when when Jonathan finally comes to the fullness of the expression of his life oh I hope you hear what I'm saying today sir when he stood on that Hill next to his father yeah no one else could pay the price Jonathan paid amen but someone had to meet the requirement someone had to stand there in the gap for his son MTH he had to stand there as a father in his position and even though I'm sure people came to him and said your father has failed your father has done this your father is not walking with the Lord he's not doing what he should be doing and this battle is going against him you should run you should leave you should do this you should do that that would be carnal but Jonathan knew his position he knew this is my place it's next to my father father right here and it doesn't matter what his father was doing his life his testimony is not dictated to by his father's walk he has his own scale to balance he his own weight of Glory to bring out and and his his responsibility is how he reacts to the situation his responsibility is for the character of Christ to shine to stand next to his father on that hill to pay the ultimate price the right price amen amen amen what a character am what a character on display and David stands there who is his friend can you imagine Jonathan his friend is is going to be king God has has told David David you're going to be the next king you know I'm moving Sol aside and you're going to lead My People Like a Shepherd and all these beautiful things and then no doubt David and Jonathan would talk about these things think of the the the Mind battles that Jonathan must have gone through the next in line to be king that was his right that was his inheritance was the kingdom he would be the next king he would have all these Provisions he would have all these things he could look after his son but look at how he came into harmony with the will of God and it was a hard thing to do it was not easy he could not defend himself he could not make claim for himself he could only walk in the path God has called him to walk but the key was staying honorable maintaining his Integrity in his walk with the Lord amen amen why because there's a glory on that side of the scale there was a there was a statement concerning Jonathan that was weighed out was measured out in the end they were not divided he stood next to his father he died with him on that hill and in dying on that Hill what did he do he purchased a seat for his son at the king's tableall Hallelujah because his son would not be able to walk his son would not have the strength the resources he would be in the wrong bloodline he would be the wrong everything but his the price he paid was the right price because on the other side of the scale there was a seat that had to be paid for at the king's table and Jonathan was willing he was the only one that could do it he was the only one nobody daddies I want to encourage you don't don't wait for somebody else to do what's right for your family only you can pay the price only you can do what's right amen and don't be afraid of doing what is right don't be afraid of standing in the Gap and I think of Arnold Von vinkle Reed right he stood there was it for Finland nobody else could do that that was his part because on in the Unseen realm there was a champion for Finland that would give his life the right price had to be paid for the freedom of Finland amen Jonathan Stan there no doubt many questions in his mind but he knew one thing Lord this is what you've called me to and I'll stand here in honor in Integrity I will stand here with my father Lord I will pay the price you know in this day we live in we think of our rights our our freedoms we're going to do whatever we want we can do go wherever we want we should we should really just become quiet before God and say Lord all this carnality around me all these voices all these things going on but Lord what is your opinion Lord what is the weight that is sitting on the outside scale let me glance through the curtain of time oh God and let me see the the victory that is waiting for me yes oh don't be afraid of the of the trial don't be afraid of standing on that Hill alone sometimes we stand there and we got to we got to face things and my brother and sister it's in those moments you are per purchasing oh you are purchasing gold tried in the fire amen and guess what that's the only thing you're taking with you so I want to encourage you today as we stand together I want to encourage you don't look at the carnal things amen don't look at things carnally there's a weight just beyond the curtain of time there's a a value there there's a glory concerning your life amen regarding you each and every one of you each and every one of you God has fashioned he's created you he's placed you here for a purpose for a reason you might say brother Chris how can God use somebody like me he can use a donkey huh how can God use somebody like me each and every one of you are accounted for you have a value in your life you have a reason for being here stop looking at your life carnally stop looking at all the listening to all the voices stop looking at at everything around you and go to the word and and say Lord what is my portion what is the the things that are written of me cuz Lord I want to walk into harmony with your will I want to walk with you oh God don't be afraid of the storms and the trials they're there to Fashion they are there to to meet out the weights of Glory concerning you oh don't you want to purchase something today you want to aren't you tired of running from God just just come to God today and say Lord yes put me on the scale today Lord yeah it's been hard it's been rough I've lost family I've I've got a you know myself I I I I could share to the things in my life but each and every one of us have a story each and every one of us have a trial that's catered that is designed is fitted just to you and in and in your life it's like a storm that's raging it's you know it's something that's got your attention but my brother and sister step onto the scale this morning amen step on to the scales and and see Lord how do I weigh out in in the glory that you've prepared for me how do I weigh out this morning then say Lord maybe there's a little temper there I don't like there's a little something there that is not reflecting you just right Lord I want that Christlike character amen that can walk through the valleys that can walk through the storms and maintain an Integrity like Jonathan oh what a you know he should be heralded as one of the great champions of the Bible for a a victory of character if there's ever a man in the Bible in my humble opinion that should get a badge should be awarded the the victory of character badge it should be Jonathan and I'm sure his son when his son sits at that table yes yes I could not bring myself to this table but somebody paid the right price thank you Jesus Paid the right price so that I can sit here today oh glory to God praise the Lord you know somebody else whose name starts with a J paid the right price for you also so you could sit at his table and even though we are weak and maybe we could not bring oursel to the table paid the right price thank you Lord of redemption to bring you to the seat that belongs to you so that you can see the glory of God in your life and as you look at the weights and you examine it maybe you'll see that there is the grace of God bought with a price thank you Jesus bought in the shed blood of the Lamb can you imagine what God thinks of you that he would pay the ultimate price for you he loves you so much amen thinks so much of you he redeemed you why because you have a purpose to play out amen you have a job to do we have a an expression to live out there's going to come a day you know there's there's only there's only a select few people there's only a small little group amen that's going to fulfill some of the scripture we which are alive and remain shall be changed there's a weight of Glory waiting for you and yeah to purchase that weight we might have to go through some trials we might have to go through some things but Lord I'm willing today I'm willing today Lord because it'll all make sense in a little while but Lord let me focus on my walk with you let me stay humble before you let me stay small in your presence oh God God refine me Lord I I'm not going to question the way you're making the clay but Lord put your hands back on my life Lord and fashion me so I can walk into that Vision one day the scales will balance you hear that click the next step you make you'll be in a different body Hallelujah may the Lord richly bless you we love you bless keep walking with the Lord amen amen take a moment this afternoon maybe and and say Lord I'm going to look past that curtain of time amen I want to see the other side of the scale I want to see what you've written about me spend some time amen go look at the other side of the scale see what he has promised what he has said about you and he will bring you to that expected end amen God bless you Lord he never promised at the cross would not get heavy and a heill would not be H to clim he never offer Victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you standing the Valley of the SE and the s say give just our Lord will show up and he will take you through the he never promised he never prom and the CR heavy and
