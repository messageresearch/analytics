morning that uh been on my heart the last couple weeks pretty strong and uh like every morning I wake up and it's been ringing in me years and couple weeks ago believe it was a Wednesday night I believe brother Warren was preaching about the blood and I think so many times we forget about that you know was reading my Bible in Exodus 13 where Moses told told the children he said don't forget he said but remember always what you've been delivered from this night right what God has done CU we know brother Braham taught us without the token right there's no way we can escape the death angel so I'm thankful for a father Hallelujah that cared enough about me that he made sure that blood was on the doorposts and then our responsibility is to get under that huh the next evening was listen to a tape at the house and where R speak to the Rock 1953 and he tells this story and this I don't know who wrote the song or the brother Brenham preached it first 1953 I don't know where it come which come first but the words in this song goes right along with what he was talking [Music] about one dark night in Egypt a fearful time had come for one little Hebrew boy who was his father's firstborn son with the angel of death passing low it was hard to fall asleep but one little lamb lay in his mind while he lay there counting sheep he wondered why the young lamb had to die why his blood was on the door through the wind and rain it still remain but he wanted to be sure so he called out to his Earthly father with a trembling voice so scared crying father will you please look and see if the blood is still there and he said Son now don't you worry for the blood is there to stay the wind May blow and the rain may fall but it won't just wash away all the blood will stand the raging Storm then apply with love and care so stay secure here you can rest assur that the blood is still there now looking over all the damage Satan's storms have left behind a flood of endless questions and sometimes doubt has f filled my mind oh but the fear that g my troubled soul it brings me back to my knees in prayer crying father will you please look and see if the blood is still there and this is what he says and he said Son now don't you worry but the blood is there to stay all the wind May blow and the rain may fall but it won't just wash away well the blood will stand the raging Storm it's been applied with love and care so stay secure you can rest assured that the blood is still there and he said Son now don't you worry or the blood is there to stay for the wind May blow and the rain may fall but it won't just wash away you see the blood will stand the raging Storm it's been applied with love and care so stay secure you can rest assure that the blood is still there so we can stay

the end of every one of the seals there was a song that he sang I love him because he first loved me and he purchased my salvation on calvary's tree and so right after he's telling us pray for Revelation there's nothing greater we can pray for he reminds us he did this for you on an Old Rugged Cross a small Lonely Hill called golgatha just never want to forget what he did for us on that small Lonely [Music] Hill in the beginning God stood in the Stillness and he spoke his creative words let there be light [Music] in the beginning God stood in the Stillness he spoke his creative words let there be light and let the heavens appear he made the oceans the Seas and the Earth and with his mighty hand he scooped out the canyon with his fingers he traced courses for the rivers he made the mountains to stand tall and still but then a slight trace of sadness came into his eyes as he made a small lonely H well then he said let us make man in our own image and give him dominion over all we will walk together in the cool of the evening I'll help him if he should fall oh but I want him to love me because he really wants to to walk with me by his own way but then a slight trace of sadness came back into his eyes as he looked toward that small Lonely Hill then late one evening God came to the Garden Adam Adam Adam Where Art Thou the birds had hush singing in the garden there was silence you could sense it that something had died oh but God said I love him and I won't let him go than a shadow on a hillside a beard for a man hung there dying crying I thirst God turned his face from

here amen thank you amen each and everyone now last Sunday I preached a sermon on excuse me who am I that was a question who am I and so that leads to an answer because every question must have an answer yes amen so I want to preach this morning on who I amise the Lord amen amen 2 Samuel chapter 7 verses 17 through 22 2 Samuel chapter 7 vers 17 through 22 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did Nathan speak unto David then went King David in and sat before the Lord all these sermons that had been preached all the visions that had been told he went and sat before the Lord and he said who am I and what is my house that thou Hast brought me hither to wow where are you taking me God and this was yet a small thing in thy sight oh Lord God but thou H has spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come spoke about future home things that are to be are you spiritual this morning and this the manner of man oh Lord God and what can David say more unto thee for thou Lord God knowest thy servant and for thy word's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them he does does everything for a purpose makes all of this revealing this Supernatural Angel visitations Thunders seals he does it for a purpose yes he does Amen that you might know these things amen thank you Lord wherefore Thou Art great to oh Lord God for there is none like thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears amen amen heavenly father I'm asking Lord God as we have read your word this morning I'm asking that the great Holy Spirit would come and anoint thy servant and anoint thy people for me to speak for them to hear because we want to know what you would have us to know with all of thy getting get understanding father and we pray for Revelation for Revelation brings stimulation Revelation brings manifestation therefore father come reveal thyself through Thy word I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning you know David was wondering because Nathan the prophet had been speaking all of these Supernatural things you wonder how many sermons how many things did he hear how many Visions did Nathan speak and I want you to understand that from the time of the anointing of Samuel to David when he was just a little Shepherd boy the battle began he kept thinking my what is all of this about I'm going to be anointed to be king over Israel but you all know it took well over 20 years before from the time of the anointing until he became king and even when he was King and during his kingship and while he was dying even his sons and different ones were trying to take his position ain't nothing easy Saints no matter how much God is with you you will go through things but guess what Jesus said I have prayed for you that you might overcome Hallelujah you are more than Overcomers in John chapter 3 couple more scriptures here John 3: 12 and 13 if I have told told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven he's making a statement here this is a declaration remember brother Brenham got a sermon from a cigarette pack he said I ain't going to pick that up the Lord said I tell you go back and pick it up pick it up and he preached the thinking man's filter I got a sermon one time off a coke bottle yeah the Lord said read it at the bottom said no deposit no return amen and I thought you I thought Father in Heaven thank you no man can Ascend back unless it it was where I was once before no deposit no return no man hath ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven what kind of a person does that make you John 14: 16- 21 I pray the father he shall give you another comfort that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me yes because I live ye shall live also wow what words and at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you there's your Holy Trinity oh my I love the word don't you at that day you shall know I am in my father and ye in me and I in you and he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him may God bless the reading of his word thank you Lord I'd like to title my sermon this morning who I am I'd like to take a subject of identifying the real you amen now you sit here so nicely this morning we recognize you because of this outward appearance that you have but that's not the real you in fact this real you is going to be subject to age and circumstances and things and failures and faults but that ain't you hallelujah amen it's not you the real you is on the inside and I want to talk about that identifying the real you I started out last week with the question who am I today I wish to change it to a declaration who I am you see because identity comes from your heavenly father amen and as we all know right now the world is in an identity crisis some of you may be in an identity crisis also just because you're raised around this message or raised in a church doesn't mean you know your identity every man's got to work out his own salvation with fear and trembling you need to know who you [Music] are that's right many in the world don't know whether they're male or female some of them don't know if they're human or animal these are in your news and in your media and then the schools have to try to provide for this oh my what is it it's eating from the Tree of knowledge and it's just becoming so perverted and we know that now your true identity begins say the word begins that's when it begins when you are born again of the spirit of God because except a man be born again he is void of the spiritual things of God because he is carnally minded and it is enity with God and neither can you know God so the beginning of the knowledge of God is your identity because you will never know who you are until you know who he is but when you know who he is you will know who you are I am what I am because of the I am and as you begin through this new birth we are told in the scriptures and even the Apostle Paul said when you were a child you thought as a child acted like a child and you spake as a child but when you became a man you put away a childish things we know even as Paul told the the early churches oh you are still babes in Christ still having need of the sincere milk of the word rather than solid spiritual meat that is induced season but you've got to grow you've got to mature your maturing has got to be also in the mind and in spiritual conditions you've got to begun to start Discerning who you are amen quit Discerning everybody else and looking at them how critical we are to look at others and we see a moat in our brother's eye and fail to see the log in her own when there was a change of ministry with the Lord Jesus and he began to say except you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood the Bible says in St John 6 and verse 60 there are many for of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it he said on them does this third pole offend you because the third pole unlike the first two is offensive it's a separating it even divides between the spirit and soul and what if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before he gave him a little bit more spiritual something for them to think about if you're hanging on the edge of the cliff he's going to push you over yeah it is the spirit that quickeneth and the flesh profiteth nothing the words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are [Music] life and there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father this coming is exclusive not everyone can come and Jesus makes it very clear so if you feel a bidding a wooing of the Holy Spirit to come if there's something inside of you that this message is drawing you come then let me tell you it's not to make you puffed up it's not to make you arrogant but when you see the grace of God you bow your head and say oh Father who am I verse 65 therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except to were given to unto him and my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus under the 12 will ye also go away right then Simon Peter and answer him Lord To Whom Shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said have I have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil I want you to understand that even in this choosing among the message God chose Devils to be among us to betray him to say all manner of evil against it to rise up and to betray him with a judian kiss have not I chosen all of you one of you is a devil it's amazing he spake of Judas the scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12 now brother Brenham as I began to now may I just kind of share from my heart and bless my heart my wife sent me a note this morning I got a text just before I come to the pulpit hey sweetheart and my pastor that melted me right there up to half of my kingdom what is it speak from your heart so shall I do am amen because this message has so affected me it is my identity I do not just identify with it but this message is my identity I found out who I am I found out I've been called of God I've been predestinated I've been ordained I was born to receive this message I take it very personal behold I sent unto you make it personal somebody say me yeah he sent unto you Elijah that he might turn your hearts back let us go from who am I to who I am make it a declaration put an exclamation point behind it in fact several times a couple emojis smiling in all kinds of stuff whatever you want in the sign of this time in 1963 there is not a person living but would like to look past the time the curtain where did I come from who am I and where am I going of all the fine books that's been read the Great Master of selections that's been made there's only one book that reveals who you are where you come from and where you're going that's it that's it and it it also let us look past the curtain to see it amen but you were born a baby immature in your thoughts in fact you were born with amnesia a very terrible case of Amnesia you had no idea of your identity you were a baby immature had immature thoughts carnal raised up C taste smell feel here you're trying to figure out all of this world around you and ever since you came out of your mother's womb you've been slapped and persecuted and and prodded and pinched and all kinds of things and a man that's born of a woman is full of trouble and lots of Sorrows can you say amen yeah look at your life it ain't been easy you're born a sinner for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ you were born with it Amnesia unbelief a cloud of unbelief hanging over you and yet in that dirt bag of humanity that surrounds that elect seed if you are a seed that little dirt bag is going to bother you the rest of your life even the Apostle Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me amen thank you Lord from These Bars of Bones that's right your worst enemy is the one you brush his teeth and look at his face every morning Paul said I've got to Die daily I got to crucify the flesh that Christ might live the prophet preached only one time only one sermon on spiritual Amnesia he never preaches it a second time it's one of those sermons that wow it's amazing but he uses the word Amnesia 28 times in an hour and a half of a sermon he preaches and talks about this Amnesia this disease that has affected people and he says and then he likes it I always love how brother Brenham takes as it was so it is so he allows us to take a good look at ourselves I wonder do I have amnesia how bad is my case I don't know I I I forgot Amnesia so brother Brandon preaches spiritual amnes let's look into it and let this diagnosis come from the prophet as he begins to under the spirit of God lay it out now this Amnesia we're told is could cause you to be a place where you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the cause is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are you find it comes from Wars sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing causes it is worry worry worry fear fear hath torment worry will cause it wow that's an amazing thing just worry yeah will cause you to have amnesia some of you worry so much about what tomorrow will be and how it's going to be and what will be the change of the body and are you sure I'm one of them and what about the blood is it really there daddy are you sure the death angel will pass over me you worry you worry so much about crossing the bridge and you may never cross that bridge why worry just have faith so now he's he's diagnosing a case of Amnesia not knowing who you are comes from a shock I had a friend of mine playing varsity football and man he he hit heads with a defensive lineman or whatever and these guys two hit helmets and boy they both fell down and it knocked him unconscious and for 3 days my friend who I knew he came to school didn't even know where he was at they had to assign him another student to take him to class and he didn't recognize anybody after you know I thought he was joking I come on Jim stop it buddy what's wrong with you you know me your old buddy I don't know you it can caused by a shock or by too much worry brother brm picks it up let's go on a little further so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue believe no now worry sometimes causes it and another thing that caus it among the people is getting between two opinions wow that'll cause Amnesia getting on the Internet and getting between a dozen opinions well what's this preacher think about this what that guy think about it what does this one say about who cares I'll tell you what quit going on to the internet and I do agree with this press play hallu but that doesn't replace church that I do believe saints of God that many of you are not at home pray press and play like you should so that you might hear the voice of God you might hear what the seventh Angels said so when you come to church you can say Amen yes sir brother Ron I read that yesterday that'll cause Amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually who what you done you've lost your reasons you lost your mind you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself that's where a lot of young people get out here and they get to surfing the internet next thing you know you get your halted between all these different opinion and guess what you get amnesia can identify who you are see Prophet said three things will cause Amnesia shock worry and halted between two opinions you know you cannot come to your spiritual adoption and your placing within the body of Christ to know who you are until you know who you are that's big you can talk about oh well I know him he's my Lord my savior he's my king he you know I heard about this and I heard that and I heard his doctrines and everything but when you have him revealed to you from him personally then you begin to realize who you are see the Bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways he said there's no black white bird there no Christian non-Christian God doesn't want you to be a chamelea he doesn't want you to be that kind of lizard well when I'm with a bunch of unbelievers I I act like them but when I'm with Christians I change my color oh look at me I I I'll throw a quote out once in a while I I heard brother bandam say to make people think you're spiritual God help us it's not just knowing who God is but it's knowing who you are it's not just confessing that you know him right because there will be many that come unto him in that day and say Lord Lord did not we do this did not we do that signs wonders all of this and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never never knew you janesco means I never conceived you you're not my conception you're not my Offspring amen because if you were you would hear my word it wouldn't offend you oh it might slap you it might shake your tree it'll never offend you because where could we go amen let me tell you I I remember just coming to this message young boy long-haired kid Surfer California hippie and every tape there was something new and you young men with your long hair it's a perversion oh man did he have to say that just tell the women not to cut their hair why do you got to get on the guys well it is it's wrong and brother brm said watch the two spirits in the end time he said man will grow his hair like a woman and a woman will cut her hair off because she dishonors her head but Hey listen the word of God is a sharp two-edged sword and when we come to church we're not here to see how good we are we're here to see huh let's have a pet scan let's have an MRI let's let's have a CAT scan let's do something man let's have the word of God look over every one of you oh oh man I see something I see a lump I see a growth I see something there for the identity of who you are lies in the revelation of your father the new birth is your identification that comes from above that is your identity like I said and I repeated it several times this message is my identity I can no longer be separated [Music] I am this message I'm a living epistle do I make mistakes that's that other guy that's the guy that I live with that's the guy that stumbles and Falls that's the guy when I let him resurrect he gets his huh come on now but the inside of you as a representation there is no sin you cannot what why because you have the seed of God remains inside of [Applause] you watch this spiritual Amnesia continuing on now there is a place that when you get this Amnesia you might get like Nebuchadnezzar how many you remember remember him yeah watch it it was who exalted himself one time and God let him think he was an animal and he lived out in the wilderness ate grass like an ox how many of you remember that in the Bible I wonder all these people that don't have identity well I think I'm a cat they even have litter boxes for him in school you got to be kidding me I think I'm a bull I think I'm a big cow you can put a nose ring through my you know why they put rings in cattle's noses you ever been around them so you just hook up a lead rope when a cow starts walking away all of these piercings and all of the this stuff why do you think that all of this piercings and tattoos it's because it's an Iden it's an identity Satan marks his people their mind a bore them through the ear because God marks his too he gives them a sign amen says his hairs grow out down on his body like eagle feathers he had become the heart of a beast in him see that was Amnesia because he had forgotten that he was a king he had forgotten that he was a human being he thought he was an animal so he acted like an animal because he forgot he was a human being so that's so easy today and we forget sometimes that the what the Christian church is we act like the World shows that we got spiritual Amnesia because that you don't act like the Christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this God help us like that little Eagle hatched out in a chicken yard amen cluck cluck cluck trying to act happy out here finding a little grain in in a manure pile trying to act like everybody else I guess this is it this is life I was so drunk last night I don't even remember what I was I threw up I I I passed out I don't even remember oh I had such a good time are you kidding me you're insane come on now that is insanity huh I I'll tell you how insane it is with if you were to take let's say three six packs of spring water and I force you to drink it I wonder how many little bottles of spring water you could go through until I'm full but let it be beer and oh man I drank three six packs last night are you kidding me it's cuz it's a Spirit come on now it's a spirit cuz you couldn't do it with physical water I don't think I got anybody in here that's got a problem with drinking I don't so relax if you do I'm on your case this morning oh you might have plucked around in the old Courtyard of the chicken you thought but one day you heard a voice the voice of a seventh angel and he began to sound it was a voice of God calling you come up higher come out of her my people be ye separate sayeth the Lord and I will receive you am Revelation from your father is what is taking away your Amnesia Revelation is taking you back to where you once were God spoke this and talked it over with job and job is going through a hard time in fact job had God to sick the devil on him have you considered my servant job Lord don't do that to me no I love you I don't want ashy I don't want to lose all my kids I don't want to lose everything and sit here and curse the day I was born so God says now watch this here's here's job job chapter 38 veres 1-7 the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind God speaks from Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counseled by words without knowledge G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me yeah where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth Hallelujah declare if thou Hast understanding thank you Lord who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it right whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who hath laid the Cornerstone Capstone revelation of this message who do you think it was brother BR said you all know the Capstone Ministry he says God kept off my Ministry with one sermon the token the token you got to be under that Capstone token that revelation of Jesus Christ amen when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy he's saying okay I want to ask you where were you when I laid the foundation of the world when the sons of God shouted together where were you yeah amen and God is saying I want you to answer me as a man tell me if you got understanding don't give me some fig Leaf religion yeah go don't give me some cover up don't give me some philosophical uh uh something that you got off the internet I want to know where were you Joe do you know he asked him this two times remember now he's been on the ash Heep he's gone through a bunch of things and in job 40: 1-10 moreover the Lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty because you know what he's he is saying oh I can't understand if God loves me and puts me through this ashy look at this shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that re proveth God let him answer it then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay mine hand upon my sh my man who am I to instruct struck God right why hast Thou made me thus why did this happen to me why am I going through all of this don't you realize he is your Lord and Master and everything that you go through has a purpose and a reason and I may not understand it quite on honestly I don't understand it all all I know is he said all things work together for the good but he didn't say they would all be good but he use them for good am Hallelujah he may have to put you on your deathbed sick in a hospital facing death itself for you to stop and look up amen sometimes that's the only way God can get a hold of your attention because you know what he passes by your way often through sermons through telephone calls through letters through through your Bible through songs and all kinds of different ways and guess what you didn't know God was passing by trying to get your attention and you are so hardheaded he said verse six then answered the Lord unto job out of the Whirlwind and said g up thy loins like a man second time he stld him that I will demand of thee and declare unto me will thou also disal my judgment will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous Hast th an arm like God or can't thou Thunder with a voice like him deck thyself with majesty and with Excellency and array thyself with glory and Beauty amen did you know that the woman is the glory of the man wow let that sink K the bride yes is the glory of Christ that's why she doesn't cut her hair because of the Angels you think it's a simple thing it's okay for you to cut your hair to trim your hair the scripture says if you cut your hair you might as well look like the pastor paraphrasing a little bit you might as well be Shor because you dishonor your head but when you leave your hair uncut as a virtue un to God guess what it's his glory and God honors you because of the angels I got a book I'll show you something I'll bring it here at to church it's little thin books called a a hair short of Glory talks about all the scriptures and different things concerning why a woman has long hair and it's a glory given under her it is a time when we should get our understanding from God do not read your Bible like you read a newspaper do not listen to this message like you just listen to some internet speaker but sit down and reverently and ask God and humble thyself and say oh God I am a I am a man a Carly minded man God get me above a all of my carnality let me go beyond this understanding of my carnal mind and open unto me the ramparts of Heaven let thy glory be known unto me give me Revelation give me amen am that which I had with thee before the foundation of the world I want my inheritance it's mine you got to claim it yes do it ain't given do you you got to go up present yourself who are you yeah who are you well according to the will I'm part of the will who are you I'm a part of he who wrote the will amen that's about me that's my inheritance you have to show your ID you ain't no illegal alien let me tell you ain't going to be illegal aliens in heaven Amen in fact even the one that made it there without the wedding garment on come on how'd you get in here you ever had a dream you weren't clothed right and you were somewhere this guy's so here he is everybody's got their their gown on everybody's shaking one another's hands and God bless you Hey where's your wedding garment um yeah what happened to him come on now he's thrown out well I thought love I thought God well you know what for you my brother I'm going to let you slide now he says he was cast out to weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth oh I wished I would have don't let that ever be found on your mouth right because if you miss the Rapture it's because you failed to discern yourself to take the word as a judgment to yourself you play around with the things of the world it's time to get wisdom and understanding because there's a deep calling to the Deep Amen brother brenaman who who is this mesic she said well you jump remember she tell come up higher well you jump you're an eagle to begin with you're not a chicken see identi was coming to him from above that's the way we do we accept God by Faith by the written word there is something in there it's that eternal life you were predestinated to it listen I was predestinated to this message I was born for it oh yeah I didn't know who I was and I bounced around here and there in fact there's still some times that I kind of have to get re reminded let me tell you you don't get this message by hearing just a couple tapes it's like a jigsaw puzzle you take this piece you know what it's funny I'm going to tell a little thing on Amos when we do jigsaw puzzles he take three or four pieces and put them in his pocket and here you're trying where is that piece I look everywhere I can man what's the name of that sermon where where did Brother brand say that I don't I and then Amos finally here it is who is this m fits right here what is the attraction fits right over here Amos you've been holding out on me son some of you've been holding out because you ain't putting the pieces to the puzzle where they go because you just think that you know the whole picture of God it doesn't come to you until all of the piece is there and there before our wondering eyes there it is there it is it's him it's Christ there he is they took the picture he said I was looking at it wrong and he says there was the cloud they took the picture I didn't take it he said I I don't the angel said you're not looking at it right turn it to the right sometimes you are looking so hard at this message you can't see it turn it right get the right Revelation cuz when the true church catches the true revelation of who she is and what she stands for and she begins to discern and withstand the two Spirits within the framework of the church amen then and only then will she stand as an invincible Army amen amen then this is who is this mil then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you'd been you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany let that sink in the part of you that never fell in the beginning your theophany being it's been calling to you amen since birth Hey Ron you're not the son of Melvin and Barbara Peterson am well who am I it wasn't until this message came across my path and something said come up here there was a deep calling to the Deep you say was it the voice of William brandom yeah God used his voice but there was a voice behind his voice there was a message within the message there was an encrypted message to me me and not everybody that heard the same tape heard the same thing that I heard nor did they come up with the same reasoning that I came up with but there was something inside of me that was telling me come up here Hebrews chapter 4 1957 in the beginning was the same he was that great spirit Fountain where all the tress all the love all the peace everything that was pureed was in this Fountain and began to form a body a theophany the kind of body that we go to not a glorified body an Angelic body like has shape and form every time I see a tree that tree is a negative there is a positive somewhere so now he's taking natural and spiritual that tree was made of something and intelligence made it and and all this Earth does is reflect the Heavenly amen amen see I see a man lovely Little Couple man and wife walking down the street sweethearts together what does it reflect blessed be the name of the Lord there is one in heaven that will not purish if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting the theophany I hear it calling me come up come up a little higher into the revealed word amen this this old body that you have here you might be a young person 18 20 years old yeah you looking pretty buff boys yeah guess what after about 20 years of age your treasure chest sinks you might look pretty buff right now but you know what it's just a matter of time bodily exercise profits a little some of you want more than a little that's all right but remember it's just going to profit a little I want to ask you how many of you do your spiritual calisthenics I command my hand to praise the Lord I command my hand to praise the Lord I command my hand but I sit there like a log and don't do anything I don't I don't even have control of my hand I control my feet some of you ain't even got control right you know what I just like to let my body I'm going to bring it into subjection well I don't feel like I don't feel like praising the Lord let me tell you yeah some of the best times to praise the Lord is when you're in the heat of the batt because when you got money when things are going good when the wife loves you the kids love you and the dog loves you and the boss loves you and everything is going right yeah you you yeah you have reason to praise him but what about when it all goes wrong on Hallelujah I don't belong in this prison I Got Stripes on my back I'm bleeding this ain't no five star I ain't got no satin sh uh uh sheets s here stocks and bonds I ain't having no fun in here this ain't five star stuff and they began to start praising the Lord amen and you can't praise him cuz you're having a hard time and lot to you see you w w w you poor little excuse for sitting there in your your little uh thing oh well it's hard I go to school and they make fun of me because I wear a dress well if you don't have a true revelation of why you wear the dress and you want to conform like they do it's easy to go with the crowd huh yeah it's easy wide is a gate and Broad is the way that leads to destruction the Bible says and many go therein but narrow is the gate and small is the way that leads to eternal life and few be that find it amen your natural body is just an old coat yeah any of you ever had a favorite coat yeah I've had one and I just wore that thing out I'd get it ripped I'd have the wife sew it up I said it n a I forget what kind of but it was my favorite jacket and I set it near a heater and the heater got so hot it melted the jacket so I had to I had her put a big old patch and it was a Nassau patch was only it was the largest patch I could find I don't believe in Nassau but I I had to patch the coat my wife said why don't you just throw that thing away now it's my favorite now watch this now I'm I'm not trying to be funny here okay brother Bram says in things that are to be one of the last sermons he says this body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once W wear see now but now you have one so much better you don't have to use it anymore what do you do you hang it in the closet for you got a one better you got a better coat it's more up to dat the one you used to wear that's we out it's that garment see you are the inside of that there that garment only done that it bore your image see but you don't need it anymore now you're hung it up it's a rag that's the way the old body is it's bore the image of the Heavenly yet it's not you you're the inside of that body you see the spirit of God in the ins inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjections because the inside is pulling it see bringing it in line with the word of God your Insight yourself your [Applause] being this body just an old coat I'm coming down to this one part here italicized or bold and what you are your real you was the image of that on the ins excuse me was the inside of that but the old code itself just bore the image of the Heavenly I want to talk about the real you have you ever identified the real you are you still identifying with things of the world you got to come to know who you are you cannot come to your TR adoption you're placing in God until you know who you are and what part you play because this great Symphony Of God is made up of many members many many different gifted gifts and let's call them instruments and if you've ever watched uh a great Orchestra and each one of them has their part the little Piccolo and the trombone and the trumpet and the big drum then we Bo one oh all get to heaven Bo right and everybody hear that that big drum but then there is the guy with the symbols I've always wondered what is the music for the symbol how do you play the symbol you know the loud crashing symbols oh say can you see and they there's only one guy and he goes by the dawn's early lie right I wanted to be that guy I'd be going no you only when you're supposed to play your part that's why this message has let you know your great part in this drama amen it's a different chapter there's many different characters but when I heard this message it began to tell me who I am and what part I play hallu thank you Lord let me repeat this your identity of who you are Lays in the revelation of your father when the true church catches the true Revelation who she is amen who I am this message was sent to let you know who you are grace and mercy extended to you forgiveness given to you because you love God I want to ask you which one of you are so perfect right now that listen the only thing that uh is holding you up as your body and and uh uh but right now you've attained per Perfection you don't ever make mistakes you don't say nothing wrong you don't think nothing wrong nobody raise her hand it's amazing it's because you know what do any of you know Grace and it's amazing not only is it amazing for the things that I did but for for the things that I do and for the things that I will do I have an advocate before the father who say I'll separate you from the love of God nothing aren't you glad that God has forgiven you thank God he's called you by Grace amen I want you to start Discerning yourself and look at so that you'll look at others differently right the closer I get to God the better you [Music] [Applause] look the closer I get to God because love hides a multitude ah can you imagine we start Discerning oursel and you quit looking at others critically I've been criticized that I allow different ones to come up here and pray and they're been married at a time or two I want you to get real quiet who are you to look down at anyone else am I want to ask you do we rejoice when a prodigal comes home or does the prodigal always wear The Scarlet Letter he went out and did and she went out and did or do we do like the father my son which was lost my son which was dead is now alive he's come back kill the fatted calf get the robe get the ring but there was part of the family The Prodigal son's brother shame on him he got an attitude how many of us get an attitude when somebody comes back to the house of God or to this message on well I tell you what I know nonsense one brother asked me one time brother Ron am I a second rate citizen because I've been divorced and remarried I said brother I said I'm not here to judge you I said I'll tell you what let me just put it this way if you'll come to church and let me preach let me preach that word of God and tell you what the word of God says and you can take the Heat and stand there and say Amen that says shows you got representation otherwise you gag me huh and don't let me say all the counsel we should discern ourselves ever look down our noses who we going to pick to come up here and pray who who you going to let sing a song special I know that guy I know what he did wait a second wait a second let me ask you a question when something is put under the blood yes thank God for the blood when it is confessed and put under the blood God can't see it wow God you talk about a rejoicing come on do you know Grace yes we shouldn't ever get such a self-righteous Spirit among ourselves that we go to look and as well that guy why would you let him get up there and pray God help us do you know I will be held accountable for all of you and none of you will be held accountable for me so if you feel that I do it and I have done it wrong pray for me that's all I'll Stand before God and there are some of you I'll tell you you've never had that problem you're pretty self-righteous but there's some of you out there that I consider real friends of mine and yeah you've had some issues but if I was real sick I know who I'm going to call and ain't going to be the righteous one it's going to be those who know Grace it's going to be those who say yeah man brother Ron I've been there amen he is my identity he is who I am for I and my father have become one there's been an invisible Union musicians if you'll come did you know that this message declares the identity of every elect SE and if it doesn't you're not El SE I'm sorry can't be because this message it is the spirit speaking through the prophet Amen to he that hath an ear let him hear there's not a time that I put on a tape of the voice of the seventh angel but what God begins to speak to me and I realize it wasn't brother Bram in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed let me bring this to a close here for a moment Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ and Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God's trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother Brenham what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not joined a church shook a hand done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon you are the mystery of Christ being revealed in laiaa [Music] they said one in 10 men will read their Bibles but nine out of 10 men will read your life what do they read when they look at you seventh angel his message woke me up I heard a [Music] shout I heard a shout behold the bridegroom cometh woke me up but remember both wise and foolish woke up at the shout it's lamp trimming time Saints what is it you got the Holy Spirit has he given you the sign of circumcision has he sealed you to the day of your Redemption do you know who you are have you got the Capstone Revelation over your house are you applying the blood on are you playing church this is a uniting time and sign it's come it's here there's been an invisible Union Galatians 2:20 say I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God God Who Loved Me gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is died in vain message was a reflection of a theophany brother Moses you sing that song Mama that's me one of the first sermons I heard the Oddball you know what I said that's me I am I don't mind telling you I'm an oddball I'm threaded to a different bow I'm a Nut am I'm threaded and every time it turns guess what it does Jonathan it brings me tighter brings me closer you know what God is doing you Revelation upon Revelation here a little there a little turning that little nut of yours to the great bolt of the word and he's snugging you up why because the whole world's falling apart but he says you know what hiney what about uh uh you know that car going down the road thank the Lord for the nuts he said that car would be nothing but a bunch of yunk if it weren't for the nuts take these nuts out of this world let me tell you it's going to fall apart when he takes us out of here guess what judgment will strike [Music] that's me Mama yes watch this brother randam said in communion 1965 right before he leaves there was another William brandom see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you think of things similar things see there was something moving yet all at once I looked up and I said I am not the son of Charles and Ella Branham there something calling he was coming to himself his theophany was speaking to him you are not the son of Charles and elram I've called you to a higher calling I'm sending you West to meet with seven angels you're going to be caught up into a consolation of angels and there each Angel has a mystery of each seal and he will break to you the mystery of that first seal second seal and that seventh angel when I looked at him he was more familiar my what about this message what about it you young people what about that picture with a halo over brother brandham what about the cloud what about all the supernatural signs what about all the visions that what's it all about is it is H have we just now put it to a couple Creeds and dogmas long hair long skirts men without long hair men don't wear shorts is that what we've made this message Creeds and [Music] dogmas oh God he says then I was born again this little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it and it begins to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remed against me no more the Heavenly identity began to come to brother Brenham to the place where he said I'm not the son of Charles an elant he said I am a predestinated ordained seed Gene of God he said God has called me to preach this message and that's what I got to be loyal to he began to know who he was he took his position in the Body of [Music] Christ we all got to recognize who we are so I too say this because of what I have heard through the voice of its seventh angel message I know who I am I am a predestinated elect seed Gene of God for ordained I was born for this message I'm a Blood Washed Born Again believer of God's grace I've been filled with the Holy Ghost token you cannot separate me from him why because I am bone of his bone and I am flesh of his flesh don't look at the outer coat that's an old garment but I want you to look there is a man inside of me that is of another kingdom I was born to preach this message I was born to be a pastor in laiaa yeah I was so I'm taking my position not boldly and arrogantly no I'm just saying I know who I am God I've been called of God I am a sinless blood-washed forgiven Son of God I am his righteousness that is not just a good verse I am claiming it the eyes of my understanding have come open yes thank you Jesus I've heard and seen the seventh angel I have wrestled with the messenger and he blessed me and he changed my life and my walk has been different ever since the question of who I am has been settled it's been answered I know who I [Music] am I know who I am do you know who you are yes if you don't then get rid of that spiritual Amnesia that doubt that unbelief Lord help me to know who I am some of you young people you know what some of you you come up you come up to the altar here you're you're crying
