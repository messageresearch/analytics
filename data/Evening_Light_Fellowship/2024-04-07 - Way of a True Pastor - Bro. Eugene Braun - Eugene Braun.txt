really want some understanding of the things that I have heard amen remember in public he told Parables I like I get excited already but in private he gave the interpretation of The Parables thank you Lord and uh my we're so blessed let's bow our heads Heavenly Father truly I'm feel very humble to be [Music] here to think that before the foundations of the world you put took a part of yourself and placed my name on your book oh thank you Lord and then you came and took that book and now I've got the opportunity to take that book for my family cuz my kids' names are written in [Music] there [Music] so appreciate you coming by Opening Our Eyes giving us courage covering us with your blood and then taking and placing us in a position where we can can have the same Authority that you had when Adam lost the book he lost three things your Prophet told us he lost the right relationship eternal life and dominion over the Earth and now when the book was back in our hands we found out we're back in the right relationship prise the Lord and not only [Music] that we're eating from the Tree of Life am and not only that now the bride is the final voice so here we are asking for favor again that you'll take your word like you did last night polish those stones so we can see our reflection yes and say that's me in your name we ask these things amen amen amen God bless you this morning God richly bless you Revelations chapter 8 this morning God bless you want to say hi to so many friends my goodness all the way from Quebec down to Phoenix and everywhere else I just feel like coming home to family over here so good to be here again and uh I sure appreciate uh the polishing of the stones last night and I could see my reflection in it and I thought Lord what are you doing after actually halfway when he's through his service I said boy the Lord I Hope You derail that boy pretty soon here now cuz he's reading in my territory right about now so God heard my prayer and derailed him so I want to say it's always a blessing for me to come to be here with brother Ron you know brother Ron sister Sandy you know they're a special spot in my heart and they've been a beacon of stability all my life you know and I really like it when brother Ron and sister Sandy come pick us up from the hotel and we come to separate vehicles and Ron comes with the truck and she comes with a car and then she says Ron did you clean your truck and I'm thinking boy I like that that sounds like home to me and she's making sure his truck is clean and then we get in the truck she said not bad I'll tell you what it's just good to have her feet on the ground amen I'll tell you something else about your pastor why I really respect him and that is because years ago he was in a situation in a church in Saskatchewan where God had led him for a while and remember there's no mistakes in God they feel like mistakes right but at the end of the day you got to either believe the footsteps of the Lord are ordered or they're not that's right I mean your bad steps were ordered just like your good steps who ordered but you don't want to believe that but God ordered your bad steps what look like bad steps also so brother Ron he was a pastoring in in scat one there and then the spirit of the Lord started working and bringing the people to a higher level and the reason I really respect brother Ron and his Integrity is that brother Ron knew that if he'd stay there too long that the church would split and he has Integrity he knows what type it would put him in before the foundations of the world to have that kind of a track record behind them so instead of hurting the church brotherr on left I'll tell you something that's why David went to the Wilderness yeah because if he'd have stayed under that bad pastor's Church he'd split that church also but David knew what type he would fulfill and David said I'm not fulfilling that type I'm leaving then David headed off to the Wilderness does that make sense to you you know that's what absum couldn't do absum right in his ambition didn't realize the type he was fulfilling yeah and he was under a good pastor amen so the seventh seal is more than just ink on paper amen it's encrypted communication if you understand that let me say this if you're depending on quotes to get you to heaven then Peter would have baptized wrong true yeah yeah that's right come on that's right amen Jesus said be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost that was a quote but he had the revelation of that courot hallelujah hallelujah GL he had the unspoken part of that quote yes amen so you know I think we're in a tremendous spot amen that's why brother Bram said in the seven seal paragraph 300 oh stop right here don't go any further that's right so that's right I have a lot of respect for brother Ron because it's not just about a man behind a Pulpit yeah speaking words that's not it's the mystery in his life brother Brandon says that it's not what you do on Earth it's the type that you'll fulfill your type will condemn you not what you do so every action on Earth has a fulfillment of a type already pre-written in the in the heavens does that make all make sense you understand see that's why sometimes when God expects you to do something in the flesh you don't have the strength but when you see your type in the scriptures that gives you strength to do what your flesh can't do right cuz your type will carry you through when your flesh won't does that make sallah so I appreciate the specials today very very very much such wonderful people you're so precious you're so yesterday I was talking to some people and I saw those beautiful little girls and I thought man how precious in God's sight is to have those children in that age of innocence and to keep them innocent all the way till the meet of Christ let's borrow let's let's read our Bibles Revelations chapter 8 when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and he saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them was given seven trumpets and a I love the scriptures and another angel came which makes it the eighth Angel amen you were those Jewish boys were circumcised on the eighth day that's right amen Christ Rose in the moral after the Sabbath on the eth day turn with me to Hebrews if you would chapter 2 um I think that's where I'm at but we see Jesus chapter 2:9 but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man and here's really where I want to get to for it became him for whom are all things amen by whom are all things to bring many sons to glory to make the captain of their boy can preach now huh to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering okay let me just back up a little bit to bring many sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation you're being perfected as you redeem your children amen you are being perfected as you pay the price of redemption for your children verse 11 for both he that sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are all of One amen for both he that that sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call you brother Hallelujah Heavenly Father such an amazing atmosphere we thank you for your grace in your name we ask amen God bless you this morning God richly richly bless you this morning I'd like to take a thought oh you know my clicker back there that clicker that they gave me there is back there I've been on a thought this the last while that I can't seem to get away from I thought I'd preach a couple of services and and now it's been two months later or something like that and the thought the the uh click click and the thought that I can't get away from is the way of a true pastor amen and um brother Brandon preached a message called the way of a true prophet and I thought to myself okay I get it there's another message that needs to be preached that's called the way of a true Pastor because I believe this is Brother Eugene Brown speaking now just and if I say some things from my heart that are off balance just forgive me but I believe most people this day n to don't recognize a pastor if they saw one we've been so sensitized to a prophetic message that we've missed that not we have not all of us but that it's easy to miss a pastoral message because we've been so well profit trained true does that make sense to you and what happens is that because of that we miss a whole portion now boy I don't know there's parents they're trying to be prophets to their children but they won't be pastors to their children amen because we've been so Pulpit taught on the prophetic that the parents can't get down and P their own children and preachers are not pastoring there's lots of preachers that are not pastoring all they're doing is preaching sermons that's right that's right and in this day and ages the idolatry isn't necessarily in the Pulpit the idolatry is in the people that they don't discern the spirit of The Man Behind the pulpit amen that's right because idolatry in its purest form is spiritual laziness to discern Spirits brother Ron's right I'm not like brother Brian I've just got a single shot brother Brian he comes but we're idolatry the essence of idolatry is the heart to discern Spirits is such heart work most people don't go to the pain of discerning Spirits they take the easy Road just to believe something somebody says and not discern the spirit behind what somebody says Eve was confronted to do not with what the serpent said but with the spirit behind why the serpent said what he said yeah idolatry at the height of idolatry is the spiritual laziness to discern Spirits yeah so when boy Han like getting very far so when by the time Eve Bo you know it's so frustrating to me we so some people are so bent on making sure you say exactly everything the way the prophet said it that the minute you say something to pull up a laptop and run a quote to see if you missed an i or them or not or something or other you know what I'm trying to say but by the time the ser got Eve there where she wouldn't catch what was added she was already deceived true does that make sense because she was deceived she never caught the knot because what happened was the serpent changed her relationship first and once the relationship was changed she couldn't catch the kn not because what happened was to the serpent if you I don't well I didn't want it this is not my topic at all but to the serpent the serpent had a god relationship just like you can make your car your God or your church your God or this building your God or brother God or whatever the serpent only has a God relationship an object of worship relationship but he doesn't have an Elohim relationship he cannot have an Elohim relationship because in the eloh you have to be part of the family and he never will be part of the family does this make sense to you you can make this church your God and Miss Christ 1,000 miles and you can make your car your God miss a th000 miles but the point I'm making is that the serpent only had a god relationship as an object of worship but but when he reveals himself watch chapter 2 the Lord God said and the Lord God said and then when the serpent came to Eve said hath not God said and she missed it then she believed not that's right because idolatry at the highest level is spiritual laziness to discern the spirit behind what's being presented do you know you can tell the truth and not be honest you can tell the truth and not be honest you can tell the truth and mislead people with the truth but you can't be honest in telling the truth and mislead people that you can't do we're coming to an age where let let's say I'm a good orator let's say I'm a good lecturer let's say I'm a good debator let's say I'm the kind of guy that can prove my point all right that's my gift I can prove my point right I can now with the message you can be a paste and cut cut and paste preacher line it up prove your point and a lot of people will not recognize the difference between that man and a pastor true right you know I was in South Africa a while ago and the guys are telling me about this chat gbt is did I say that right you guys is that right chat gbt is that what it is you can take a thought throw in a computer program and tell the thought exactly how tell the computer how to present the thing piit you at a spit you at a three-page essay and presented in complete professionalism and it's AI generated true do you know what I mean but but if that's the natural we've got preachers doing that in the spiritual as well computer generated thoughts but they themselves are not called but you know you say that's bad no that's [Music] good what do you mean that's good because the Bible says in God's host are vessels of honor and dishonor that's right and God doesn't take away the vessels of Dishonor to make it easier for you does he now I need a big amen he needs you to have the ability to discern God's house in the honor and the dishonor cuz in God's house there vessels of honor and dishonor now listen let me just say this this is not about people going to hell because they do stuff wrong all I'm saying is that David needed a Saul Saul did David good cuz Saul taught David things about himself that God needed Saul to teach David Avid about himself and without taking Saul out David wouldn't be near the character he was today so what I'm saying is in God's house are vessels of honor and dishonor and you need the vessels of Dishonor for your discernment Perfection the way of a true pastor let me just recap we've been so profit trained that sometimes if a minister comes behind this pulpit and if he starts really pastoring you guys think he lost his anointing true because we've been so p ized or so prophetie lived out on this Earth Ephesians 4 God has given you pastors teachers prophets Apostles so you can take your faith and get it to look right on the ground until we all come in the unity of Faith does that make sense now you dare do without a fivefold Ministry because the fivefold ministry is there to help you get your faith reflected in your Works am I making sense so so I find this topic fascinating because we're actually all Shepherds true the chief Shepherd is Jesus Christ I don't want to go through a lot of scriptures because I'm I've got a single shot right so I don't have all the time to to go Blaze through this stuff right the chief Shepherd is Jesus Christ so if you want to know if you're lining up to be a pastor your Chief Pastor is Jesus Christ your second Pastor is the pastor to the age as the seventh Church age messenger your next Pastor is brother Ron and myself to the church your next Pastor the father to the family and your next Pastor the mother to the children and all of us have to line up under that one straight rule your example is not me or brother Ron it's your Chief Pastor is your example okay does does that make sense so the point I'm making is that that all of us are the basic word for Shepherds and parenting actually in the Hebrew is actually a feeder somebody that teaches that's your first priori is to feed and to teach amen and you find out that the Lord is my shepherd and so the grass is not greener on the other side that's right right if you've ever been under the chief Shepherd you're at rest you're not a fence jumper cuz I shall not want listen there's more of this word available for you than you can swallow way more brother Brian yesterday when he was preaching I thought man some I wanted to preach a message on the seven Thunder voices between the feet and the side then when he went into interval I thought shut up because there's an opportunity that has to be recognized sir you know you know what I mean l cuz that season is going to close there's a certain season that opens and that season is going to close and in that season you better recognize what the requirement is in that season because the door is going to close one day cuz it's open in that season and so the spiritual health of the children our reflection of the shepherding and that goes all the way down because we're actually a a nurturer of the rotation of fresh grass let me tell you a little bit about Psalms 23 in Psalms 23 there's four levels of grass Still Waters Green Pastures table lands in the presence of your enemy The Shepherd takes his sheep through all he keeps his sheep on the move through four levels of grass glass grass lion ox man eagle and the shepherd's job is to keep you moving through the revelation of the word because in every Pastor is different nutrition that you need to keep you moving and you take a sheep if you leave a sheep by himself and don't move a sheep he'll graze that grass and regra that grass and he'll dung his own grass and he'll kill his own Roots he'll literally kill his own grass cuz Sheep by nature don't want to move so the shepherd pushes you from Revelation to revelation to the seals to the breach to the interval to the Millennium to Revelations 19 go back to Genesis 3 go up to the point is there's nutrition at every level of grass because it's the she the Sheep's worst enemies to leave him alone right but you'll find out that God actually loves your children more than the parents and you'll find out that God also loves the church more than the pastor and you'll find out that God loves this bride age more than brother brandom turn with me oh yeah just let's go uh Ezekiel 34 should be the word of the Lord came to be saying son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them thus sayi the Lord God unto the Shepherds woe to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flock it's true you eat the fat you clothe you with the wool from the sheep that is you kill them that are fed you feed not the flock the disease you have not strengthened neither have you healed that to a sick neither have you bound up that which was broken neither have you brought again that was driven away neither have you thought that was lost but with force and with Pulpit cruelty you reigned [Music] them you know if I'm a pastor right I'm a father Pastor grandfather and a horse trainer one time I was in a show ring and the horse that this girl had in the ring you know they were having a internal argument and the horse just royally blew up right in the sh ring right she came out of the ring and it was so good she came in the ring storming mad and she said this stupid horse and an old trainer just walked by and he said horse reflects the trainer do you know that the authority figure is responsible for the relationship to the subjective figure did you know that do you know that the minute a husband throws his wife under the bus he's lost his position cuz he's her Redeemer yes the minute brother Ron blames this church for his hardships he's lost his position do you know the you say yeah but my wife did this or my husband or my church or whatever do you know that when you're not getting the results that you want you've only got one option you know what that is Dad's to the family pastors to the church brother brandom to the age Jesus Christ to the world when you're not getting the results that you think you should deserve you know if you don't want to lose your position you only got one option you know what that is make a greater sacrifice you know before the Old Testament God would say Moses I'm so sick and tired of them hard stiff necked people step aside Moses I'm going to kill every one of them that was before Calvary do you know after Calvary you'll never ever find Christ again blame the church because Christ himself if the church isn't responding the way that the church should respond he sends him another church Aid messenger with more word another church Aid messenger more word another church a messenger more word after Calvary Dad if you're not getting the results you want from your wife or your kids you got one option you got to get yourself dedicated to the Lord first cuz the minute the authority figure blames the subjective figure you've lost your respect in your position as a leader when I see stuff in my church I don't like I'm looking in the mirror d Russian da but if my church does good and I'm proud of them I'm looking through a window and give them credit but if I'm not getting the results I want what's it did the horse is only as good as the trainer God loves your children more than you those children became innocent they came loving Mom and Dad no matter how bad mom and dad are they came with unlimited forgiveness the kids got a 10 m the mom and dad got a 10 mile Head Start in the relationship you know God loves you more than brother Ron you know God loves the bride more than brother brandham that's why he held them on such a tight leash do you know what a a a chain shank is on a horse he does what's supposed to happen is this you're my horse this is what's supposed to happen okay if if this is my horse and if he's got the seven seal relationship to me he just wants to know one thing what do I want that's it I don't need a lead shank between me to you stupid horse but if he's got my mind if I move what does he do he's getting yet that's the seventh seal but you know if the horse isn't responding and is one of those horses that can't get the attention what you do and if he's not listening cuz that horse is useless if he's not thinking about me I don't care if a a if a rabbit runs across the road or if a cow's over there if there's a tornado there if his mind if I'm going like this and his mind is over there boy and if I can't catch his attention to where he's thinking about me first I got to do something because we're headed for a Rapture and you better be in tune with your Jesus Christ cuz when he I'm going with him what I'm trying to say is I'm not waiting for him to come I'm waiting for him to leave and when he leaves I want to know he's leaving cuz he's [Applause] here but if he's not listening then you can take a a chain shank with in instead of the Lee shank on his halter there's a chain portion of the leite shank you put it under his chin and hook it on this side and then if I pull and he's not yanking I'll yank yank that thing and boy he'll back up and there'll be some blood and there'll be some hurt and he'll do like this but guess what we got his attention but what's supposed to be the end result of the chain shank when I move move you know what I mean like the attention is not for pain the attention is to teach us something come on very good and so the minute a trainer blames the horse the trainer's just exposed himself the minute a dad blames the wife he's just exposed himself the minute the the parents blame the children they've just exposed them themselves the minute the pastor blames the church he just exposed himself because these are laws of redemption yeah yeah a prophet has a prophetic view remember Paul was a prophet but James was a pastor right James is the first Pastor you know that's what Paul saw but what James saws your Works proves your faith Paul said your faith proves your Works James says your Works proves your faith looking at the same thing from Pastor angle and from prophetic angle because what you believe should end up feet on the ground and the pastor is concerned that what looks like feet on the ground matches what you believe amen if that makes sense the way of a true Pastor a prophetic view is the world view the big View and I thank God for that that's not that is wrong but the other side of pastor's view is teaching those principles so that it looks like it on the ground that's the pastor side of the Prophet you know somebody told me the story I thought was tremendous he said they asked brother brandom about preachers and all kinds of preachers and stuff and brother BR says hold up your hand and he says look at this he says take this is your pastor he's the Lord on the totem pole see that he's the ox the most unnoticed then you have Apostle evangelist Prophet apost uh teacher and the rest of it but he told him you know what you want to know what the purpose of a pastor is he said try to pick up something with the Evangelist and the apostle come on then he said try to pick up something with the Evangelist and the teacher he said every evangelist needs a pastor every Apostle needs a home church every preacher Apostle needs a pastor take care of his family every man that thinks he's a prophet needs a pastor cuz with the pastor you can pick up anything and yet we've got computer generated preachers it's good for a while but no grip and I'm just saying that I don't I I got no Personal Agenda but what I'm saying is we've got such AI technology that I wonder if the people would ever discern a real Pastor is what I'm saying or is it a la a good lecturer does that make sense to you now see CU I know the natural typees the spiritual now apparently you can go to uh some kind of an app and tell that app Listen draw me a picture of brother Brandon standing side ice Dwight Eisenhower you know under a tree discussing the Seven Seals and that Apple draw a picture and you would be hard find if that wasn't real I say what separates these things I'll tell you what it is it's the seventh seal yeah amen it's what's not spoken amen somebody told me the other day he said don't you Jean don't you just love what's spoken I said yeah but I've been listening to what's not spoken because you see when the angel came to eler elzer is looking for a wife and the angel came to elzer and then the angel made elizer promise to listen the woman that takes and gives me water and the camels water that's the girl when eleazer meets Rebecca elaser says by the way would you give me some water and she says sure I'll not only give you water but I'll also give the camels water it wasn't spoken she caught the mind of the angel that had visited in the unspoken promise and there was no quote for that that's right so I like this now my subject this morning I trust God this is uh the unveiling of Christ the second paragraph after he read the scriptures he says I trust that God will reveal this each time if you take the tapes and listen and I hope and trusting that that you have had a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it outright can you imagine here's the prophet he has now taken and placed himself at a spot where he has to get something over to you that he's not allowed to say can you imagine that means somewhere there's a secret communication that's beyond reading ink on paper yes sir brother B says when I write my wife a letter you know the story got it you know the story and brother says he said you know he says this Bible is full of secret communication yeah and you know you didn't have to tell David look at the seven seal so so Saul cuz he's not got what it takes to overcome Goliath and David says this isn't about killing Goliath this is the war of the Gods man he just insulted my God this is not about what's H this is an insult to my God that's what this is and David recognized spiritual food and due season recognized this day the scripture fulfilled David knew the all of Israel was under an indictment if there wasn't a mercy Angel come and take on Goliath so David he you didn't have to tell David what to do does this make sense David you didn't have to tell David David knows that's his Target that he knows but now he's relying on what's not spoken to do what's right he heads off to a brook and he gets five Stones smooth Stones you can only have smooth stones in Living Waters amen you don't produce smooth stones in a swamp you need rivers of Living Water pass those stones to smooth them up by the way and he goes and gets five smooth stones from Living Waters and then he takes those smooth stones and he puts it in a script he doesn't put it in his pouch no sir why doesn't he put it in the pouch cuz he's revealing a mystery because the script is a secret little pocket that only the owner has access to that seven seal is where the five-fold ministry needs to be he takes those secret those stones puts them in the secret script puts it and closes the pouch out why he's showing you something about yourself when you're going to hit your Goliath cuz you're going to need a living water fivefold ministry under the anointing of that seven seal for your Target to hit the Bulls amen but you didn't have to tell David that he was living at a mystery that he himself had no ink on paper [Applause] for why because he that sanctifies and he that is Sanctified are both on the equal terms call themselves Brethren yes brother brandom said you know this message is amazing to me it's flat out amazing to me because what it does it doesn't just give you it's not ink on this this message is not ink on paper this message is secret communication looking for a wife cuz you could read the ink on paper and never produce a wife that's right because a wife is equal to the husband because he that sanctifieth and he that is Sanctified is equal and he can call them Brethren on the same plane which means that he that is Sanctified has the mind of the sanctifier that's why brother B says let me show you in the back part of your husband's mind let me show you what the three-fold purpose is number one that he's going to take excuse me and number one he's got a three-fold purpose in the back part of his mind you understand what's he doing revealing himself what's the next thing he has a preeminence what's the purpose restore the kingdom but only the bride knows that what's in the husband's mind what's he doing you putting you in the position as wife why so what's been happening to me in the last couple of 10 years I don't know this book is a brand new book man yes I don't know what happened to me I don't know what happened to me but I know when it happened to me I used to read the message at this level and now I'm reading the same message yes but I'm seeing something totally different more the message hasn't changed I've changed I've been moved from there to there come up a little higher let me show you something you've been invited Elijah was invited into the Chariot John was invited to come up a little higher and you know what es Ruth ended up at his feet but she had to be invited to a side you can't barge your way into heaven you need an [Applause] invitation thank you let me go a little bit further I'm not getting very far what time is it take your time brother no man we got dinner yes amen see it's the thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave some to ponder over it's done that way purposely it must be done that way cuz not everybody's going to be listening to for what's not spoken I like this am Psalm says he made known his ways to Moses his AXS unto the children of Israel you mean to tell me that you could be enjoying the acts of Moses and don't know the ways of Moses you you mean to tell me that you could walk through the river and not have any of your shoes wear out and have benefit of the Mana have benefit of the quail and still not know the ways of the Prophet you mean to tell me that you could be in the first in second pull and know the benefits of the Prophet but not know the ways of the Prophet could it be that the acts of the Prophet are there to sear the conscience so you can find the ways of the Prophet if you don't understand what God's doing right Hebrews 3:10 says whereof I was grieved with that generation said they do always he in their heart they have not known my ways but they saw the axe they saw the acts but they didn't know the ways they didn't know the principles God operated by they didn't catch the mystery they didn't catch what was going on they saw the Miracles and they saw the stage show and they saw the you know all kinds of stuff and they saw you maybe I can say it like this they saw a prophet and they saw people come up on the stage and they saw people get what they asked for but that doesn't say they caught the ways of God just cuz they got healed does that make sense and the same thing has happened in church you could come to church and hear my voice but still not connect with the pattern of God in your own personal life amen H and this whole mystery like brother Brian said yesterday is actually a mystery of redemption that's right marriage boy here we go into the ways and the acts okay what is a marriage a marriage is not a man and woman living in a house no a marriage is not necessarily man and woman living in a house going to church paying ties paying off for mortgage and and uh and raising kids that doesn't say you're married did that's the acts got it but marriage is a mystery between Christ and the bride in other words you could have all of that and there's no mystery being revealed right now the acts are all there but still miss the ways of what actually a marriage is what's a marriage Ephesians 5 a mystery between Christ and the chur right so the church the female is dependent on the male for Redemption because Redemption always goes male to female so there's acts and then there's ways the axe if you're listening with the right ear will show the ways and the point I'm making is a marriage is a mystery between Christ and the church or the bride and he's the one that can hold her blameless amen catch me now okay let me make it real plain honestly plain in the right act of redemption when that boy comes up here with that girl comes up here if that girl has been one has had 100% disclosure got it do we have to come to Christ with 100% disclosure do we do we need Christ to redeem us can we pick ourselves up by our bootstraps can we redeem ourselves let me ask a question every one of you came condemned the minute you were born you're going to hell why because you came by sex birth the fact that you came by sex birth guarantees you're going to hell and the point of it is you came wrong my question to you is a man cannot lift another man to a higher level it takes somebody that's not born by sex to pull a sex man up to his level because every one of us came wrong in the first place and coming to church won't fix that Redemption comes from male to female and this church my church cannot produce one single son and daughter of God because it takes the male Jesus Christ to come in his word to redeem you in this church if Christ doesn't come you're going to hell because this church can't save you that's the truth true and when that boy and girl come there the it's an act of redemption it's not just signing a paper and having a preacher pronounce and then going off that's not what it is that boy and girl are coming to here and there's a man of God with a spoken word oh Lord help me now man I have wondered this Lord you know so often brother I feel I I don't feel you know the other day or it's the other day I'm over 50 so it's the other day right I'm preaching at brother Ron at brother Chad's and I feel completely lost I'm under condemnation I don't feel good about myself and I'm struggling with my own self and then he asked me to preach well much to my surprise I preach anyway and it doesn't matter how I feel God still comes and I'm wondering where does that come from listen your salvation is not dependent on how you feel that's it when that boy and girl come up over here this is an act of redemption if that girl has been 100% honest and open and if he takes her on that basis he cleans her up 100% she has no condemnation and dare he ever remind her of what she did wrong cuz then he breaks his own vow when he does that dare that husband shame the wife after he takes her in full confession because the husband redeems that wife and it doesn't matter what condition she's in if he is a Son of God he can clean her up redeem her and set her free by that marriage vow brother Brandon says I'm not waiting for the wedding I'm waiting for the reception we are married right now Hall we're not celebrating under the Feast of atonement we're celebrating under the Feast of of Tabernacles we have been through the marriage we're rejoicing going on to the wedding supper thank you Lord You Lord see now I'm pulling up my machine gun let me get back to my single shot you could be in this message and not realize who is here for what purpose to take away your condemnation and if you've been 100% honest with your husband he can redeem you back to Virgin status one more time because Redemption goes from male to female you could memorize this message and be a lousy wife to Christ am I making sense you could be a preacher behind the pulpit preaching this message and owe people money back there that you don't want to shake their hands cuz you fill some money off of them and you're not mad enough to go make that right but you're behind this Pulpit preaching you shouldn't be behind the pulpit you should go make that right first pay that guy back so you can shake his hand and pray for him they saw the acts they didn't recognize the ways marriage goes from male to female this church can't produce one single son and daughter of God not one not one this church is female a woman can't bring a boy to manhood yeah a woman cannot even bring a girl to Womanhood yeah it takes a man a father to bring a boy to manhood it takes a father to bring a girl to Womanhood these are the ways of God and Adam had to meet four requirements for Redemption the first Adam he was a spoken seed word of God and he was given a bride to reproduce himself and that's why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God because why at the end of the today you can't be a better parent than you are a spouse you can't be a better parent than you are a spouse these are the ways of God you know in the Garden of Eden you have an Adam and an eve their marriage was already perfect and God said said it is good there's no children yeah you think you're a good parent check the way your marriage is and check your spouse if you're a good spouse true I think I'm a good pastor I better check to see if I'm still wife to Jesus Christ first does that make sense to you yes I'm no better Pastor than I am wife until you until you're a good wife to Christ you can't even love your children correctly true these are the ways of God can you imagine a father or a father doesn't take foot washing communion pretending he loves his children what a liar get right with Christ first can you Mt her father he he steals God's tie cuz God pays everybody 10% too much right can you imagine him being a thief stealing God's ties and then pretending he loves his wife come on tell you what Dad you get right with Christ first amen does that make sense can you imagine me thinking I'm a good pastor and I've got condemnation between me and Christ do you know why God was so hard on brother Brandon cuz he loved you true and you and you and you and when brother brandom got his mind on his mother-in-law and was debating that battle what did God do he jerked his lead sank he did you got no right to take your eyes off of me cuz I've got you and you and you and you to be saved thank you Lord that's true brother I don't know what time what time is it R quarter to 12 only a father can bring a boy to manhood that's why Jesus when he was 12 years old remember his mom as a 12-year-old boy the woman's always hanging on to the boy right and that's good but the boy had to undergo the experience of breaking away from a female so he could be adopted by his dad and a man that if the I told my church this a while ago if I'm here creating a dependency on you and you depend on me and I depend on you you can't do me no good if you can't leave my church for the word's sake you can't help us you better get Christ first and then find out what church you're going to that's right because a man that can't walk away from a woman can't redeem her a church is a woman yeah Peter James and John they were in the Mount of transfiguration and here they saw the father adopt the son what's the first thing they did they wanted to run to the woman for a completion let's build three churches what do you do and you saw the father adopt the son and you're running to a woman for completion the denominations came to brother Brandon the woman and said listen buddy you want to just lay off a little bit on this preaching will'll buy you a jet we'll give you a home how much salary do you want you know what that was the woman after the prophet do you know why Joseph could break away from pifer's wife cuz he valued his relationship with the seven colored Rob that his father gave him his father's relationship in the seven color Covenant was more important than that woman chasing him and he could run away from that woman only because he was attached to his father and and a man that won't redeem a son will get caught by a woman and the woman is selling a mystery you come to me I'll Make a Man Out of You that's the lie that's the LIE cuz a woman can't take a boy to manhood only a father can take a boy to manhood the ways of God his machine guns down there I'll just pick up my single shot it's qu to 12 huh Mark 16 14 oh boy Lord only a father can bring a boy to manhood a mother cannot do that only a father can bring a girl to Womanhood a mother cannot do that you notice the woman that was caught in adultery and she was the church was the one trying to condemn her but she had to go to the mail to be freed you know the woman that came into Matthew 26 with the alabaster box huh you're going to see it right away here's the priest the church condemning that woman right because of what she had done but notice she knew where to go for adoption Oh Lordy help me now Brian Mark 14 remember he that sanctify us and he that Sanctified are equal he can call them Brethren yeah oh this is going to be my last point and I promise not to pull up my machine gun when David appeared on the scene remember the number eight is always always mixed up with seven true okay so in one Bible part of the Bible David they said David is the Seventh Son another part of the Bible David says that he's the eighth son actually there's a mystery there because seven the number eight comes out of the number seven in eternity because we're in the seventh Church age but okay maybe you're in the seventh lady oia is the seventh Church age but I'm living in the eighth round maybe I can say it that way okay got it all right that's good when David appears there's a mystery in him there's a king in him but he doesn't know it right the prophet comes and he takes the oil and he pours it in a horn and he takes the oil and pours it over David's head and the oil connects the head to the body but it starts from the head goes all the way to the body right right in this generation the head came in' 63 yeah but we needed a prophet to anoint that had to show us what was happening and he took the anointing from the head and poured the same sing on the bride the church with his oil understand yeah all right the the prophet connected the body and the head yeah because there was a king inside of David oh now I don't want to do that either there was a king inside of David but the prophet had to come and anoint him with a horn of oil notice the prophet anoints David with a horn of oil but Saul with a horn with a vial true the same Prophet yeah now now you've got vessels of honor and vessels of Dishonor anointed by the same [Applause] Prophet brother Brandon goes to Revelations 219 and tells you it's the vile angel that says let me show you the wife yeah then he goes to Genesis 24 with elaser and he connects the elzer ministry with the vile Angel why cuz the same Prophet that made opening for you brings the tribulation to the rest of the world he anoints one with a vial and one with a horn that's why the Bible says and the angel with the seven V said let me show you this woman right so the point I'm making all I want to get back to him getting carried away here now this this machine gun's coming out all the time is that the prophet anoints the head and runs it all the way down to connect the head and the body CU he knows his ministry and the effect of what it will leave in the bride right but there's a prophecy in scripture where there's another woman that thinks it not robbery to be equal yeah oh Lordy Mark 14 and this is my last place I'm going to cut everything off Mark 14:3 and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman with an alabaster box of ointment of nard very precious and she broke the box and poured it upon his what is she oh what is she doing pouring it on his head that's a prophet's position but she's read indictment she knows her time in the season she knows this is the day the scriptures fulfilled she's recognizing her day and her hour she knows Christ The Mystery of God revealed and she's not ashamed to be called equal with her husband Hallelujah glory god Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah what do you think you're doing woman you're supposed to be like ask Ruth and get to the feet yeah but she has got a mystery written in her life for you for you for you to think yourself not robbery to be equal with what God has given you look what God has invested in you in the scriptures but notice she had to take that wax the ointment they had in those days there was a clay jar then they took wax and heated it until it was liquid and then they sealed the lid with the liquid Vox notice the seal that seven seal had to be broke first before the revelation of the first six seals were released that's true amen and she she got the alabaster box she knew how precious the ointment was but she knew that she's the one that had to come and break that seal off of the top to release the Revelation to the bride and here she's got that box and she's nervous cuz Simon the lepers just looking for an Avenue to condemn her and she's under the condemnation of the church but she's not going to church for Relief cuz that's female she's going to Christ for Relief the male cuz only a male a father can take a girl and bring her into Womanhood God bless you I'm [Applause] [Music] done mus if you want to come you know I'd like to teach you a little song If you want to stand and change your position a little bit last night I rejoiced like crazy to see when brother Brian polished that stone and there was The Taking of the book One More Time right yeah do you know I'm thankful that he came and took the book with my name in okay that's number one but number two it shouldn't stay there yeah because the parents should become a lamb also a slaying lamb also to take the book with their children's name in it cuz all that God was he poured into and all that Christ he poured into so what Christ did for us we've got the ability and the position to do for our family because the book holds our family names so I'm happy that Christ came and redeemed me now that's true but the story doesn't end there because remember John eats the book but now we as ministers and as family and as dads if we'll get off of our high horse and become a slain lamb and become the sacrifice the way that that lamb was for me we can come in the volume of the book in the way remember they saw the acts but they didn't know the ways well I'm telling you the ways all that God was is in you now and if God came and took the book for you you can take the book for somebody [Music] else but you know what it does though it takes somebody

play their part in the day and the hour they didn't know it David didn't know to go and kill Goliath he was just bringing lunch oh God he didn't know he was going to be king he was just tending his father's sheep he didn't know that when he killed the lion and the bear that God would use that the Catapult him into a place that when a giant before him and then he realized this isn't Flesh and Blood yeah that's it he has defied the god of the army of Israel amen oh Father I thank you and I pray now that you will bless us with your presence Lord let us not just just go outside and lose it
