Amen. He is here this morning to meet each and every need. Amen. I'd like to ask brother James love all if you'd come this morning, Brother James, and open our service in prayer and just take these requests before the Lord. We have a thank you card this morning from Sister Lori, Brother Randy Snow, and their family. and they say, "We just want to take a moment to thank you first of all for the many prayers on my behalf." God has been so merciful. We have witnessed so many supernatural touches that only he can give. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know for sure it's been the prayers of all the saints, also for your generosity, the gift that was given to assist towards our financial needs that is so humbling. But we thank you from the bottom of our hearts and looking forward to what the Lord has in store. Amen. God bless each one of you. The snows. So let's pray. Lord, continue to be the sister Lori and grant her a complete and full recovery. Just thank the Lord for what he's already done for her. Sister Josie Robless this morning says, "I want to praise and thank our Lord. My brother Arthur Banks is in hospice, but he's now walking and talking, smiling, showing progress." So I want to thank the Lord. So let's continue to remember her brother Arthur Banks in prayer. Pray the Lord continue to be with him. Amen. Sister Joy Brander turned in request this morning. She says, "Please remember my c-orker Elizabeth and her family in prayer. Her husband was found unresponsive last week after an MRI yesterday. They've conclude concluded he is brain dead. She has three boys and a very serious decision to make. They do not know the Lord personally. They need comfort and salvation." So, let's remember this coworker named Elizabeth and her family. Pray the Lord would just come upon the scene for them. Amen. Sister Nancy Tempe has two prayer requests. One this morning for brother brother Jim needs a healing touch. He's been having some prostate issues for a biopsy on Tuesday. So, we're asking the Lord to remember brother Jim in prayer and also Sister Nancy's asking the the amazing church family to continue to pray for me as I start a new process in my cancer journey. Will take 90 days. She starts rigorous testing in the next two weeks. They're going to be taking her white blood cells, be modifying them, she says into Seal six, Seal Team Six Snipers. So, sounds pretty interesting. But whatever they're going to do, let's pray the Lord just be with Sister Nancy and these treatments that she's going to be undergoing. They're be putting the cells back into her body on October the 15th, hoping for a positive result. So, let's just pray. The Lord be with Sister Nancy. The Lord's brought her this far. He can complete the healing that he's already begun in her body. How many would have a need this morning? Just lift it before the Lord. Brother James, if you would come. A lot of people on the road for the holiday weekend. Pray Lord just be with them. Grant them traveling mercies. Brother James. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and our hearts. [Music] Our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we humbly approach your throne of mercy and grace. Father, we can pray and seek your face and have fellowship with you throughout the week. But Father, there's something special when we come into your house, Lord, when we bring our licks of fire together, oh God. Maybe there's some amongst us that Lord, they just need a another anointing of your Holy Spirit to come and to minister live. Father, there's needs that have come across this desk. Oh God, they've been pinned down, Lord, that they would present it in faith, oh God, that you would have your special way in their lives, oh God. And so we're just asking, Lord, that you would meet the needs of your people according to your will and to your way, oh God. Father, Brother Jim, and this Lord, Lady Elizabeth, oh God, and her husband and whatever the need is, Lord, brain dead. But Father, you're the very one that created our human bodies, oh God. And Lord, we're just asking that you would move in a special way, Father. And as we gathered this morning, Lord, we believe that as the word would go forth, that it would have an effect, Lord. Would our grounds be prepared, Father, for the hearing of your word, Lord, that it would bring forth life and liberty, oh God. That it would return, Lord. Your word would never return void, oh God. So, we're just asking that you would be in the song service that you would go and by the foolishness of preaching that you would touch lives. &gt;&gt; Father, be with those that are out traveling. Would you give them traveling mercies, Father? And Lord, would you have your way this morning? &gt;&gt; We create, we ask, believe, and have faith that, Father, you would meet every need according to your will. &gt;&gt; Move this morning. We commit it in thy hands in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother James. You may be seated this morning. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Want to welcome each one here if you're visiting this morning streaming on the internet. Just a reminder, next Sunday, the 7th of September, we will be having communion and footwashing. 5:00 Sunday evening here at the church. So, looking forward to that. Then, well, as well, just a reminder, Sunday school starts next week and that'll start 9:20 over here in the singing room for the children. If you have not yet completed one of the information forms for your children, if you could pick one of those up on the bulletin board and get that completed, get that into the deacons or one of the Sunday school teachers. We get an idea as to how many children we've got, where they need to be, and contact information, all those sort of things. So would appreciate that. Amen. Thinking on the song yesterday, there is power. Power. There's power in the blood of the lamb this morning. Would you be free from your burden of sin? Amen. The blood is here this morning. Amen.

Lord, &gt;&gt; we ask it in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you all this morning. Just remain standing. Amen. Turn with me in your Bibles to Amos chapter 8. Amos chapter 8. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's Labor Day weekend. Many are traveling. Um and we ask God for traveling mercies. &gt;&gt; Um Amen. Brother Steven Love, he gave me a a ball cap. It's handed to me just before service. I guess a lot of you still have hair on top of your head and you don't need a cap. I need a cap and uh but I appreciate it, brother Stephen. Um you know the other day we were preaching on a prepared place for a prepared people &gt;&gt; but I didn't mention that there is all two prepared places heaven and hell. &gt;&gt; Because hell he says I have prepared &gt;&gt; for the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to that enemy. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ah, take that. Yeah. Because there is a place prepared for the devil &gt;&gt; and his angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God that we won't be there. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; we've got another place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're doing. We're here this morning to check up, &gt;&gt; make sure that we're prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for grace and mercy in our lives. I thank God that watch over us. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other days, this is a little comical. You'll the wife and I, we were just doing a little uh decorating in in the home there in Prescat and and we're in the She wanted to put some stuff in the bathroom up against the wall and you have to step into the bathtub to hammer a little sign and do a little this and that. And so we're both standing in the tub and she's saying, "Okay, put the nail here." So I put the nail here. So, okay, do this over here. And so, like this. And Sandy steps back to take a look at it. Well, you're in the tub. &gt;&gt; She grabs me and we both go over whammo. Out of the tub onto the floor. We both look at one another. I I said, "So, who's going to get up first to help who to get up?" We big old bump on the back of my head. I said, you know, hey, we're getting too old to be falling out of the tub, but thank God. Anyway, thank God he watches over us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles, please, to the book of Amos, chapter 8. Amos, chapter 8, verses 11-2. Behold, the days cometh, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from north even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it. Amazing. It says the days will come when there'll be a famine in the land. He said, I'm not talking about a natural. &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about spiritual &gt;&gt; famines and droughts within the Bible are always a sign or a symbol of God's punishment because of people not listening to the word &gt;&gt; or being obedient to the word. they will uh seek they'll go here and there nowadays they'll go to the internet YouTube they will Google it they will ask Siri or Alexa or the computer give us an answer there's only one book that'll give you the answers for what you need and that's the Bible Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our thumb. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I think if you have a question, ask God. &gt;&gt; Get in your prayer closet. &gt;&gt; Get on your knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seek God. He said, "If you'll ask, it shall be given." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you seek, you shall find. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. in Matthew 24. Let's turn to Matthew 24 verses 44 and 46. Matthew 24 and verse 44. Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man cometh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who then is a faithful and wise servant, &gt;&gt; whom the Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season. Blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find. So do he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who then is a wise and faithful servant. to give the people spiritual food &gt;&gt; in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke to Peter, he said, "Peter, do you love me?" "Yes, Lord. You know I love you." Ask him three times. &gt;&gt; He said, "Peter, do you love me?" "Yes, Lord, you know." And being a little grieved in his spirit, he said, "Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what we are to do as ministers of the gospel. &gt;&gt; We are to go into those places, the prophet of God said, the word of God, message of the hour, and break it down and bring it to the people to feed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is our responsibility. We're not here to just tickle your ears. We're not here to just become emotional, but we are to get into the word of God &gt;&gt; and have some daily bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So turn with me now if you would uh to Psalms 23. Very familiar portion of scripture. And I'd like to read it as a congregation together. Psalms 23. And we'll read verses 1-6. And so if you all will be so kind, we'll read it together in unison. Let's start right now. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you for your word. &gt;&gt; It's a comfort. &gt;&gt; It is a compass. &gt;&gt; It is a guide. It is a pattern. &gt;&gt; It is our destiny. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Show us another portion, Father, of thy great plan &gt;&gt; today. Feed us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Yes. I pray that you will bless each and every one and now take this servant as I humble myself before you and I ask use our lips to speak something to feed thy people. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord. Amen. like to title my sermon this morning um a table prepared in the presence of mine enemy &gt;&gt; or our enemy. &gt;&gt; So there is a table prepared &gt;&gt; and I would like to take this morning for a subject the spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, spiritual food will come to you in due season, even as you mature and grow in Christ. &gt;&gt; We know that we all must mature, even as you see it in the natural, so it is in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You do not take a newborn baby and try to feed them strong meat &gt;&gt; because they can't take it. See, but as they grow, God gives them teeth, gives them the ability to assimulate what they're eating into their bodies and stuff. And so, uh, I pray that each one of you are mature Christians &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that strong meat belongth to them who are of full age. &gt;&gt; Amen. They've come to a maturity. They're able to take the strong meat of the word and they're they though you were raised on the sincere milk of the word and the love of God and those things as a young Christian, but as you grow, you begin to now begin to catch things that you didn't catch when you were younger. &gt;&gt; And so I thank God for that. But what we need is for God to give us spiritual understanding of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now food and water are necessary commodities for us to be able to uh live and u and have a life in this lifetime. But the prophet Amos there was saying there's coming a day when they're going to go from east to west. They're going to be a famine in the land. They're going to be seeking and they're not going to find it. &gt;&gt; Because you have to understand God will set a table prepared. But if you refuse, if you reject, &gt;&gt; you understand then then what happens? Then a famine comes upon the people &gt;&gt; and uh you know you can only be bidden so many times. How many understand that that there is a a limit to God says uh uh ask the people to come and he says prepare the feast. I've I've bid them to come but there's coming a time when it says but Lord they they've refused. They one went to uh uh uh he he bought a cow, another bought some land, and they gave all these excuses. My brother, my sister, let none of us have any kind of an excuse of why not to get into those things that we see in this our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God for this hour. Lord. &gt;&gt; Now I want to take in the direction this morning that there is a table prepared &gt;&gt; in the presence of your enemies. &gt;&gt; So God does this openly. Right? &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to do it in a corner or in some hidden place, &gt;&gt; but he does it so that you will have a place even in the midst of your enemies. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amongst the scoffers and all of those who want to reject God's word, God says, "I'll prepare a table for you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brennan P picks this up in Jezebel religion and he says, "Now God sends forth a message and tells the people and they don't receive it. Then he withdraws his servant and sends his plagues, famine, death, spiritually speaking, physically also. You watch for a depression, brother. You think you've seen something, just wait after a while. &gt;&gt; You haven't seen nothing. &gt;&gt; You think you're dying for a good spiritual revival, you wait till after a bit. You just wait long and cry to hear the word of God. The Bible said so. There'll be a famine in the last days, said the prophet. And not for bread and water alone, but for hearing the true word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that voice will be quiet in the wilderness somewhere, hid away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are now in the midst of this prophecy, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the midst of a time when famine is here. There's all kinds of ministries. There's all kinds of preachers. There's all kinds of different ones that say that they are called of God. And I'm not here to try to talk about that, but I want to say that it is the ministry's responsibility to preach spiritual food &gt;&gt; in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's the time now that the bride, listen to me carefully, the bride herself has come into the place. This is not the orchestration of man. This is not man's doing. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit around the world is bringing the people into a far greater understanding than they've ever had before. &gt;&gt; The word is becoming unveiled. &gt;&gt; The word is unfolding in such a way &gt;&gt; that it has an effect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It must have an effect on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just knowledge I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It's not just teachings, &gt;&gt; but it must have an effect that your life has changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's hard to find a message church nowadays that's giving a seven course meal. that's feeding the full menu. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're lucky to get a slice of bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when I was growing up, uh, we ate a lot of bread at our house, but my mom bought that Wonder white bread. Wonderbread. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we loved to eat that Wonder White bread. We'd make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and boy, you to put it on there and you could eat five of them because that bread was just there. Well, there wasn't much to it. You just, you know, and it wasn't until uh after that. And you talk about wonderbread, you wonder what's in it. But I uh when I got married, my wife, she started baking her own bread and she started milling her own wheat and making wheat bread and and when you've got homemade bread and there's substance, &gt;&gt; there's something there. Let me tell you, you got to chew it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to chew it. There's something there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A sandwich made with homemade bread with real wheat seed in it. Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; it'll fill you up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not like these little wonder sandwiches that you've been making as a kid. &gt;&gt; All of the fluff. &gt;&gt; God, give us something with substance. &gt;&gt; God, give our ministry. God, give us here in this &gt;&gt; this pulpit &gt;&gt; a time where A full course meal is set before you. &gt;&gt; Everyone loves to sit at a table that's well prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember that when before I got married and we were single brothers in the church in Flagstaff, Sister Py Patterson would invite us to come over for dinner and she set a table. If you've never been at her home for a meal, my we she brother Mike could say, "Sister Paty's invited you boys for dinner tonight." Well, we wouldn't eat breakfast or lunch cuz we were under such expectation. &gt;&gt; Why? The table was set and the butter and the gravy and the meat and everything. And we just couldn't wait. And I'll tell you, when you're when you're expecting &gt;&gt; Yeah. Even as you walk up the door, you can smell something cooking. Huh? How many of you have ever gone somewhere and and or you're you're crossing the street, you're going to your restaurant, you you get a whiff of the smell. You You're already you're salivating. You're something. There's something about I can't wait. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me some. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I want something that's got substance. &gt;&gt; I want wheat seed. &gt;&gt; I want something that's going to going to make me uh have some power &gt;&gt; and nourishment. &gt;&gt; Give me something. Because if we're not careful, we're eating the wrong kind of food and you get weak. &gt;&gt; You got to take a nap all the time. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you, if you get into the real good kind of food, it'll give you power. &gt;&gt; It'll give you something to run around about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cause you to move. &gt;&gt; Get into action. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; My wife, she went to the And I know she tells me, "Don't tell those stories." She went to the grocery store yesterday and she bought these little round potatoes about the size of a golf ball. Then she realized, "Oh, I probably need two of those. Two bags." Well, she only had one. She and she told the lady at the register, "Can you hang on? I'll run." She did. She My wife ran all the way back. A grandma ran all the way back, got the bag of potato, and came back. And she says, "Honey, I surprised myself if somebody would have known how old I am &gt;&gt; and that I'm a grandma and I'm running through the store with a bag of potatoes." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you, my brother, my sister, God, give us something, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; That will cause a nourishment within us. &gt;&gt; Okay? Not just not just something that gets you. I don't want a filler. &gt;&gt; I want something that'll fill me up. &gt;&gt; That'll give me something substance that after two or three days, I'll tell you a sermon that is God full of vitamins and nourishment. You'll be chewing on it for days. &gt;&gt; You'll be getting together. You'll be talking about it as you're going home from church. You say, "My, did you did you chew on that? Did you hear what he said? Did you think about that quote? Wow. There's something about it. You just get into it. You chew on it for days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The brothers when we get together on Monday morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I tell you. And and they're just there excited and they're been talking and they've got quotes and they're talking to one another and and and brother Paul love all. He sits there and he goes, "Yes, brother. Yes. That's what it's all about. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it when you get men excited. &gt;&gt; Listen, my brother, my could care less who's playing the Super Bowl. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I could care less who's winning basketball or any of that. Give me someone who's been wanting to have fellowship around the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not interested in politics. I'm not interested &gt;&gt; in those kind of things. I'm interested in talking about our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting into the substance, something that I can chew on. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that's got eternal value. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we all go through things. I look in the scriptures and I see Elijah how he has a Mount Mount Carmel experience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's up there and and he kills 450 false prophets up there at Mount Carmel. And what a what a you talk about a one-man army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we find in First Kings, I just want to show you something to show you a type. First Kings chapter 19 verses 1-8. And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow and about this time." And when he saw that, he arose and went for his life. Wait a second. &gt;&gt; Here's a guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That has just killed 450 false prophets with the sword. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, when the anointing's on you, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, you're left and right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to slay the lion, the bear, Goliath. It don't matter. Come on, baby. You want a part of this? &gt;&gt; And here Elijah just &gt;&gt; slew them all. &gt;&gt; I and I alone. &gt;&gt; And so &gt;&gt; the word comes to him. Now watch when the anointing is gone. &gt;&gt; Watch. After good meetings, be careful. &gt;&gt; After you've won a great victory, the next day the devil's all upset. Oh yeah. You think you think you got a blessing, then he steal it from you. How many know what I'm talking about? Brother Brandham said, "Be careful. Even Mondays for ministers are a hard day &gt;&gt; because they done stirred up the nest the day before." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the anointing has left him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what amazes me is he runs from a woman. &gt;&gt; A woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You would think he'd stomp right out. Okay, Jezebel, come here. But no, he runs. So, look at this now. He arose and went for his life and came to Beersa, which belongth to Judah, and left his servant there. And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. Brother Bram said he ran a marathon. &gt;&gt; He did. He run 30 miles. He Jezebel. He gets out there into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die. Here's Elijah. Take my life. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever gotten like that? &gt;&gt; Any of you ever had situations where you say, "I might as well die. Go ahead, God. Take my life." What? I'm Huh? &gt;&gt; Little pity party at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is enough now, oh Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my father's, and he lay and slept under a juniper tree. Beheld, then an angel touched him and said unto him, "Arise and eat." Now, wait just a second. Let me give you a quote. I'm just I'm paraphrasing it. He said, "God in heaven knew that Elijah was in trouble and he was deeply vexed in his spirit." &gt;&gt; And so while he slept, he sought God did &gt;&gt; for the angel with the softest palms of the head &gt;&gt; to brush the brow of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So after he asked that he might die and take away my life, he slept under a juniper tree. And there an angel tells him, touched him and said unto him, "Arise and eat." And he looked, and beheld, there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid down again. He's He's taking a nap. Oh, this is so good. said, "Oh, he eats and sleeps." I get that way after a nice meal. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him again said, "Arise and eat." Because the journey is too great for you. Sometimes, saints of God, I want you to understand, God is very, very mindful of what you're going through. And sometimes the journey that you're the trial, the issue you're about to go through may be too great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is mindful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he arose and did eat and drink and went on the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb, the mount of God. I say, "God, give me some of that angel's food. &gt;&gt; Give me some of that kind of cake &gt;&gt; that won't just hold me until the evening, won't hold me throughout from Monday to Friday, but God, give me something that for 40 days and 40 nights, I don't even need to eat or drink." &gt;&gt; Oh, you talk that that's something that Red Bull knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 nights. &gt;&gt; Baked fresh from the coals of God. &gt;&gt; Sustain the profit for his journey. &gt;&gt; See, when the anointing is on you, the enemy leaves you alone. He'll back away. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; But when the anointing leaves you and you don't feel it, &gt;&gt; and sometimes you wonder, "Am I even saved? I don't even feel like I'm saved. I don't feel like I'm the elect of God. If I was the elect of God, why am I going through what I'm going through? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "And what hearest thou Elijah?" He called them together, and the God of heaven answered in a supernatural sign to Israel that he was still the God that could answer by fire. And he did just what he always did. Answers prayer and he kept his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that God still keeps his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And after all that, this still still it wasn't sufficient. And that little old Elijah didn't know what to do and he run to the juniper tree. I'm glad there is a juniper tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All God's people Yes. &gt;&gt; Needs to go to that juniper. &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; All of God's people &gt;&gt; need a place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There are times that I just got to get alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The wife can't comfort you. Your dog can't comfort you. Nobody, your kids, anything. Huh? &gt;&gt; You just need him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a place where he was so discouraged. He didn't know what to do. So, he ran out to himself himself and got under that juniper tree. Many of us feel like going there. &gt;&gt; I've been there times in my life &gt;&gt; when I'm so distraught, so discouraged, so just frustrated. Any of you ever just get frustrated? &gt;&gt; You don't feel his presence? You try to read and &gt;&gt; seems like there's nothing there. &gt;&gt; Nobody seems to understand and you don't know why. I &gt;&gt; don't know why. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, there is a place. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And God is mindful of each and every one of you. And when you get to that place, if you'll understand, God can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity. He knows what is in your mind. He knows what you're going through. And even when you cannot help yourself, &gt;&gt; God is there and he's willing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will meet you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you may have to go through some things. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want just uh good sermons. &gt;&gt; I want something. Here's what I've been praying about. And I've been asking God, God, I know that the ministry of the the five-fold ministry within the bride of Jesus Christ because they asked the prophet, "Will the bride of Christ have a ministry before the coming of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "But it'll be ever so simple." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's going on now. apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. &gt;&gt; He and and my brother, my sister, it's not just one gift. &gt;&gt; It's five gifts. &gt;&gt; God gave gifted men. God called. God ordained. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Men to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; This message doesn't carry itself. The ark of God did not gravitate by itself by a supernatural levitating power through the wilderness. No, it was carried over the hearts of the Levites. &gt;&gt; And then God is still doing it. This message, &gt;&gt; these tapes, the books, they just don't find an address and go there. There's somebody that's preaching this gospel that's getting the people excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everywhere we go when we preach the gospel, we come back. People &gt;&gt; they write to voice of God. They write different places and say, "Send me the book. Send me the tape. &gt;&gt; God, help us." That's ministry. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach my message. &gt;&gt; I've only got one message. &gt;&gt; I'm just a postman. &gt;&gt; I'm delivering a letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst &gt;&gt; for righteousness, for they shall be filled." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, they will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, if the ministry has been feeding from an open book, &gt;&gt; that's it. If they've been catching the revelation, the congregation then is also feeding &gt;&gt; from the open book. &gt;&gt; What is it? Revelation striking the people. Huh? Not just some kind of uh fluffy stuff that gets you all uh get some head knowledge in here about some kind of dimension and over here and a graph here and the people ooh and awe by all that. But we need something that'll stick to our ribs. We need something that gives us power tomorrow when we when we leave church and we go out there and you face the enemy and you will see him. I need something to overcome the enemy. &gt;&gt; I need to have power in my life. God, give me a nourishment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That only comes from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Give me this day &gt;&gt; my daily bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seal of the antichrist, brother Bram says, more preaching is being done than ever in the world and less practice than we ever did in all the world. More preaching, get less practice. &gt;&gt; Men come in anointed with the of the Holy Spirit. They preach with everything that's within them. And the people walk right away as if nothing has ever happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. just unconcerned. Now, there's got to be a reason for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and study this. It tells you what the reason is. Did you know that the scripture says there'll be a time in the last days there'll be a famine, strike the land, not for bread and water, but for hearing of the word of God? &gt;&gt; The men go from east and west, north, south, seek to hear the word of God, not shall shall not find it. &gt;&gt; Just think of the times we're living in. And we're living in that time. I believe when the prophet spoke that he foresaw the United States of America &gt;&gt; cuz it's the only place I know of would meet the description in this day. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Power of decision. Brother Brandham says this. Did you ever taste any of this spiritual mana? I've seen people get so much of it till they lick their lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a real gastronomical jubilee. Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking. Oh my. It fills you out. &gt;&gt; You know when you get real weak and get a great big square meal. How good do you feel? &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's one of those times that you have to unbuckle the belt. &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you, God give us sermons that'll unbuckle our belt and you say, "My goodness, I'm so full of that." But I tell you, it's just a matter of time and that which you assimulated during that sermon, it'll be gone. I need some I need another meal. Hey, bring some more. I need more of that. Raise your hand this morning and say, "I'm ordering. I'm ordering right now. I want some more of that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you do in a restaurant. When you want a little bit more, you raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Hey, waiter. &gt;&gt; Waitress. Hello. &gt;&gt; Bring me some more. &gt;&gt; That's what you're doing in church. Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; I want some more. &gt;&gt; That's good. But I want more. &gt;&gt; Give me another slice of meat. Huh? Don't be Yeah. We just went on the cruise. And I tell you, you know, on a cruise there, you've paid all that money and everything and then they got the buffet there before you, you know, and then they gave a little slice. No, give me another slice. No, one more. Put some juice on that thing. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I pass up all of the nonsense stuff. Huh? Yeah. I just go for the meat. &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a carnivore. I want to eat lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, watch. He says, "That's what's the matter with the church today. It's anemia. &gt;&gt; They're they're not getting enough spiritual food. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, God help us &gt;&gt; to get into this spiritual food &gt;&gt; to get into it. &gt;&gt; It would be horrible to die of starvation &gt;&gt; while living in a grocery store. Come on. &gt;&gt; If you're hungry, reach up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pull something down. &gt;&gt; Rip it open. &gt;&gt; When you're hungry, huh? You know, I tell my wife, you know, she's fixing a meal or something and I'm in there and she says, "Honey, it's not ready yet." Well, I here, give me that package. I'll open it up. That can of tuna. Give it to me. What do you need done? Chop. Chop chop. Hurry up. I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not real patient when it comes to eating. &gt;&gt; No, I I have a sign. Hungry. Hungry. You know what hangry is? That it's an emotion that you have when you're extra hungry. My wife, she she tells me it's not ready yet. Well, I I can't wait. I go sit I'll sit at the table while she's still cooking. I'll sit there with my fork and knife and come on, bring it on. Anyway, I'm not let &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said in seeds not air with a shook. He said the real true elect seed doesn't eat just any kind of dead carrying. hop around from this church and that church and go over here and a little bit of dead carrying a little bit of of stuff from way back in another age and hop over here. &gt;&gt; Huh? Eating all kinds of dead carrying it was from another age roadkill. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, give me the fresh meat of the word for this hour. I'll tell you that's you know even Sandy and I keep we have our morning devotions and we read our Bible and when we do we read two or three sentences or verses in scripture and she says you need to preach on that. This is so good. Look at that honey that is so good. Oh it is true. The word of God when you're under an anointing &gt;&gt; every verse. Wow. Look at I never saw that underlining. Honey, you know, hey, give me that marker this that and and and you know, so much of the time, honey, you need to preach on that. You need to preach on that. &gt;&gt; What you Anyway, &gt;&gt; write it down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Write it down. That's true. Write it down. Because I'll tell you, if I don't speak it, sometimes I I'm old enough now that I start to say something. Johnny, I'll be talking to somebody and oh hey, you know, like this and somebody uninterrupt me and then I'll say okay well go ahead. What were you gonna say gone? It's in cyberspace, man. Huh? And certain thoughts, you know, oh man, that's good. I need to go write it down because if you don't write it down, you'll forget it. &gt;&gt; God help us. Huh? Take mental notes because there's things going on in your life and God is giving a little a little hint, a little clue. He's giving you a little something. Write it down because it's important that you can take that and meditate on it and pray about it and seek the mind of God because he wants to give you something. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, God wants to give you something more than you wanted. &gt;&gt; Meditate on the word. &gt;&gt; And after you get done reading and praying, why don't you just be still &gt;&gt; because in the stillness He might speak. &gt;&gt; We get up after we're done. &gt;&gt; So quick. &gt;&gt; I've prayed. I' I've sought him. I asked God for an answer. &gt;&gt; And before he can answer, I'm already up. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to go to work. Got to go do these things. &gt;&gt; Well, how about after you're done, be still. and know that I am God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be still. Stop for a moment. &gt;&gt; Okay. You see, that's why John was told, "Come up hither, John." And immediately he was in the spirit. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, you got to get into the spirit of the word. &gt;&gt; And then he was caught up. Come up hither, John. I want to show you things which is going to come to pass. And John was told to take the book and to eat it. And I want to repeat to all of you, take this revealed word and eat it &gt;&gt; and simulate it into your bodies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Into that spiritual man. Feed that spiritual man &gt;&gt; on the spiritual food that is in due season. Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have many things I wanted to share with you, but I see you cannot bear it now. &gt;&gt; How be it after I'm gone, &gt;&gt; he said, "The Holy Spirit will bring this to your remembrance." &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, there is a delayed reaction many times to what you've heard and you shove it and you say, "I don't understand that." God says, "That's okay. That's all right." and you shove it and you're you're doing the dishes, you're at home, you're sweeping the floor, you're at your job, you're driving your car, you're doing something and all of a sudden, &gt;&gt; man, &gt;&gt; all of a sudden there comes a quickening from God &gt;&gt; and he quickens your mind &gt;&gt; and he brings to your remembrance. Thank God you got it on your hard drive. That's why faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word. And you may not understand it. Just log it. &gt;&gt; Put it on your hard drive. Because if it's not on your hard drive, how can the Holy Spirit bring it to your remembrance? It's not there. &gt;&gt; That's why thank God some of you I know are not catching it. That's all right. Keep coming. Keep coming. Keep coming. Keep reading. Keep listening. &gt;&gt; You know what? One day all of a sudden, bang. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right. &gt;&gt; In St. John 6, brother Brennham was telling us that the ministry of Jesus changed &gt;&gt; from the first and second pole to third. Watch this. St. John 6 verse 53 through 58. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, &gt;&gt; and drink his blood, you have no life in you." &gt;&gt; He's never said this before. &gt;&gt; He's never talked about, "You need to eat my flesh and drink my blood." Now, in the natural, to a carnal mind, you think this guy's a vampire. &gt;&gt; What do you mean eat your flesh? drink your blood. &gt;&gt; Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I'll raise him up in the last days. &gt;&gt; For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And he that eateth my flesh and drinkketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him. As the living father hath sent me, I live by the father, so that he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. &gt;&gt; This is that bread which came to he you know what he's doing? He's saying this &gt;&gt; is the bread which came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; I am the bread of life. This is the bread which came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Not as your fathers did eat mana. And it was heavenly mana. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And are dead. &gt;&gt; He that eateth of this bread shall live forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in the time of the Welsh Revival, there were people that were hearing of a great revival going on in Wales. So they they went over there and they began and there was a little &gt;&gt; policeman with got his little bat or whatever and he's swinging it like that and he said, "Sir, kind sir, can you please tell me where the Welsh Revival's at?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You're looking at it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, where's the bridal? &gt;&gt; Where's the bride's revival? &gt;&gt; Right here, &gt;&gt; you're looking at it. &gt;&gt; Oh, it may not look on the outside, but inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something going on. There's a transformation. It's happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's being changed from one glory to another glory. &gt;&gt; I'm being changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm getting more homesick. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I am homesick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I want to go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not Not this home. &gt;&gt; Not the one I got a street address on. &gt;&gt; I want to go home. &gt;&gt; Just talking about &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is anybody feeling like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I I'm I'm kind of sick of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the message of the hour? You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; It's left the tape. &gt;&gt; It's come off of the book. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's become living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You become living epistles. &gt;&gt; I'm a living book. &gt;&gt; I'm a walking encyclopedia. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, listen, once you have taken this message and the word of God and you've got it in your life, &gt;&gt; it's not that you've memorized it. &gt;&gt; It's not that you know, great knowledge is up here. But I'll tell you, when people ask you a question, and brother Mario was with me, we were over in the Philippines. He said, "Brother Ron," he said, "any of these ministers come over and they have great big meetings and all the people in four or five days and and after the meeting is over, the minister leaves and goes to his motel and then comes from the motel back to the meeting." He said, "We never have a time of questions and answers." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Ron, would you mind if we could just get all the ministers together and we we have a time of questions and answers?" And I tell you, I had I had caught a cold right at the end. It was the day we were leaving or the day before. And I man, my head was so stopped up, my nose and everything. And I said, "You'll have to put a Kleenex box at the at the pulpit." I said because you know I'm just my nose is running and I don't feel real good. But I said yes. So they got to all the ministers together and I tell you the real truth. Now here is what is always best and what I prefer is to get the questions a day or two ahead of time. You pray about it. &gt;&gt; You go look it up or something. But when listen this message if you don't know it and it's not in your heart, &gt;&gt; you know I don't need a computer to go find it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I need the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It was so supernatural that while and they just gave the microphone. Okay, brother, what is your question? Stand up. You got a question? Yes. U brother Brennham, he said this and this and uh what did he you know and they'd ask some question. I'll tell you while they were asking the question, God's giving me the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I may not know the page and paragraph, but I'll tell you if I know it, I'm going to tell you. Yes, he said it. &gt;&gt; And here's what he said about it. I may paraphrase it, but it's there. &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Marcus Becker &gt;&gt; when he he first came into the message, he heard me preach, he got so excited that I'd say, "Brother Brennham said." So he wrote it down. "Brother Ron said that, Brother Brennham said." So everywhere he went to preach after that, he'd say, "Brother Ron said that, Brother Brennham said." Till finally they said, "Who's brother Ron? Now, he gave me one of the best compliments, Brother Neil, that I ever gotten in my life. He said, "You said, Brother Brennham said it." And finally, we could look it up on computer. This was before the computer. &gt;&gt; This is before this, you know, folio views and the table and all that. He said, "But I wrote it down. And I found out that he said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, saints, why do you think I put a quote up here for you? You think I just want to read? &gt;&gt; I want to take you and show you this is what Elijah said. &gt;&gt; Here's what the messenger said. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to to uh tickle your ear and bring some kind of new doctrine. I am here to put you in remembrance. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, let me be a real true Timothy. It's not me. It's what Paul said. &gt;&gt; I'm sure they kept coming to Timothy. Why are you always saying Paul said Paul said? &gt;&gt; Well, he knew Paul was the messenger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I know who is the messenger. It's not me. &gt;&gt; It's not some preacher. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. It's time to wean ourselves away from the sincere milk of the word &gt;&gt; and get into some real good, strong meat. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5 verses 12-4. For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need one to teach you again, which is the first principles of the oracles of God, and have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For everyone that uses milk is unskillful in a word of righteousness, for he is a babe. Now, don't make fun of him because he's a babe. Only make fun of him if he stays a babe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grow up. &gt;&gt; Act your age, not your shoe size. How many how many ones within this message are so immature &gt;&gt; about this message and about serving God in the way that even Paul said, "I serve God in the way that some men call heresy." &gt;&gt; Amen. For strong meat belongth to them that are of full age, &gt;&gt; even those who by reason of use it or lose it, &gt;&gt; who by reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. We got nurses and different ones in the medical profession here. What happens to if you bro break your arm and it's put into a cast and it's immobilized for six or eight weeks and they take the cast off. What happens to the muscles? &gt;&gt; Atrophy. &gt;&gt; They're still there. &gt;&gt; When my son broke his arm and he was weeks in a cast and finally they took it off and the doctor said, "Straighten your arm." I can't. I can't. No. So, it hurts because by reason of use. How many of you your your faith muscles have atrophied? You haven't used faith. &gt;&gt; You use money. &gt;&gt; You use doctors. &gt;&gt; You don't need God to heal you anymore. You run to the doctor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Used to be. used to be they brought the sick to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God give us &gt;&gt; disciples &gt;&gt; that'll tear the roof apart &gt;&gt; and let a man down before Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's power in the name. Yeah, I understand when you're sick and you you need to stay home. I understand. And I'm talking about it used to be that it was an institution of healing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bring all the halt, the lame, the sick, &gt;&gt; the blind, those that need help. &gt;&gt; And they brought them to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we take them to the hospital. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with hospitals. Nothing wrong with doctors. But sometimes I want you to understand the doctors can do all they can &gt;&gt; and you're no better. &gt;&gt; Like the woman who had an issue of blood and she spent all her life saving and she was no better. &gt;&gt; She heard about Jesus one day. &gt;&gt; There he was walking among the crowd. All of a sudden, Jesus stops. There's people thronging him, people calling out his name. &gt;&gt; Have mercy. Oh, God. And he stops. Who touched me? &gt;&gt; Peter, what do you mean who touched you? Can't you see all these people are touching you? But I perceive &gt;&gt; somebody in the congregation &gt;&gt; had faith. &gt;&gt; Somebody was pulling me. &gt;&gt; Somebody halted me. Somebody touched me. Why? I feel virtue has left me. &gt;&gt; I feel a part of the energy source within me &gt;&gt; has gone to somebody and they needed a touch. They needed a jump. &gt;&gt; Who touched me? &gt;&gt; And when she felt she could no longer hide herself, she said, "It's me. I touched you." She never physically touched him, Bo. &gt;&gt; She never touched his skin. You know what she did? &gt;&gt; The hem of his garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. his dressear. &gt;&gt; Do you know what brother Bram said? You know what God's dressear is today? &gt;&gt; He said it's the ministry. &gt;&gt; That's why my brother, my sister, and I am not making myself anything. &gt;&gt; But I am called of God. &gt;&gt; I am called of God. I cannot run from it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Though I have so many times. But my brother, my sister, if you will believe that God in his offices, if you respect the office of God, &gt;&gt; God will respect you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have need of something, &gt;&gt; then you call for the elders. &gt;&gt; It's not the elders calling for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No, you call for the elders. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have them lay hands on you and pray over you with oil and you shall be healed. &gt;&gt; There should be signs following the believers. We're not out here looking for signs. Signs follow. &gt;&gt; I expect signs to follow. &gt;&gt; I am not boasting, but let me brag on him for a moment. There's been so many times supernatural signs have followed my ministry. &gt;&gt; Unexplainable over in Africa they had, you know, and sometimes I'll have four and five translators and there was one little tribe of people that they had no one there that spoke English that could take their dialect and speak to the people. They couldn't speak whatever language it was. And while I was preaching and this group got so excited because they heard me speak in their dialect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that &gt;&gt; they heard me speak in their dialect. &gt;&gt; So after the service, they came over and they said, "When did you learn our language?" I said, "I don't know your language." &gt;&gt; But I said, "He knows it." &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "It wasn't the changing of tongue, &gt;&gt; was a changing of ear." &gt;&gt; Because many of those people come and said, "How is it that we hear? &gt;&gt; We hear the many wonderful works of God in the tongue wherein we were born, &gt;&gt; me and Perlammites and &gt;&gt; and yet these are Galileans. &gt;&gt; Why is it that we can hear them in our own language? &gt;&gt; God, there are so many supernatural signs that follow the gospel. It's not the man, it's him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Another time somebody come so excited. Brother Ron, Brother Ron, I saw an angel. &gt;&gt; I saw an angel standing beside you &gt;&gt; while you're preaching. I said, "Well, did it bless you?" They said, "Yes, yes." I said, "Then be blessed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't go and say, "Okay, uh, okay. What did it look like? Let's put here. Let me Yeah. Let's get it recorded and I'll put it in my newsletter and send it around." No. &gt;&gt; Hey, now. Hey, I expect it. I expect God to do supernatural things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a fanatic. I am. I I don't mind letting you know that the Bible says who by use &gt;&gt; of their senses exercise. &gt;&gt; Use the discernment you got. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Exercise &gt;&gt; that you might know right from wrong, good from evil. &gt;&gt; Don't just sit there listening. Use discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Something on the inside. I tell you, you listen to some minister and he's teaching something that's a little bit odd. Something inside of you said, "That don't sound right." &gt;&gt; Right. My goodness, this got an uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; He may say, "Brother Brandham, set it, but I don't know. This is &gt;&gt; it's got an awful uncertain sound. It's something inside of you, a little flashing red light. Be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful." That's why I've always said that, "Hey, the internet is just full of all kinds of ministers with all kinds of opinions and interpretations, and you got to follow me. And if you don't follow my ministry, you're not going to be in the bride and everything. Oh, I tell you, they come and go. &gt;&gt; But my brother, there's only, let me say this. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; There's only one prophet messenger &gt;&gt; that was sent to this age. His name is William Marian Brandom. &gt;&gt; And it's his message &gt;&gt; that is ordained of God to turn your hearts back. &gt;&gt; But I'm a part of the ministry under him. Because the brother Brennham said, "The final voice to the final age &gt;&gt; under their messenger." &gt;&gt; That's why. Say what he said. &gt;&gt; Say what's on those tapes. Don't be afraid of it. &gt;&gt; Get in there and eat it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't exercise, you become unskillful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Means inexperienced. ignorant. &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I love to watch a man who is skilled in this trade. I do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because it it's it's fun to watch him. &gt;&gt; Hey, he he grabs this tool. You know, you ever watch a a a guy that he's got the tools of the trade and he's got his tool belt and he's got his hammer and his and screwdriver and everything like that and he's there working on a job. He don't sit there and go, "Let me see. Uh, screwdriver. Where? &gt;&gt; Where's my hammer? &gt;&gt; No, he he it could be dark. &gt;&gt; He's got the tools. He knows it's trade. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a water system put in my house the other day. A kinetico. I'm not No, it's not an advertisement. And a guy's got all these filter systems. And he says, "Okay, in here and you you got to get under here and after so so many gallons and this thing's going to turn and you're going to lose the color and you have to put the new filter in there." I said, "Well, can I do that?" He said, "Yeah, you probably can, but it'll take you an hour and a half to two hours and can't." He said, "Call me up. It's 40 bucks." I couldn't throw 40 bucks fast enough. I don't have time to play around with this filter and take this here like that and then mess it up and then have to go to Home Depot and try to find the parts and fix it myself. Let the guys that know what they do know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Or do you guys all try to &gt;&gt; fix your own car all the time? Huh? your carburetor's acting up or something. Used to be used to be. &gt;&gt; Huh. That Hey, years ago, you could you could raise up the hood of the car. You could see the whole engine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, you raise you got it's covered. &gt;&gt; There's plastic all over it. &gt;&gt; And a carburetor. How do I get to the What is the carburetor? Does it even have a carburetor? &gt;&gt; No, it's fuel injected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you go to tinking around next thing. [Music] Then you got to okay get a tow truck. Tow it in. The guy said, "What happened?" I don't know. It just quit. He said, "Looks to me like you've been fooling with it." It didn't just quit. No, you've been fooling with it. I tell you what, we ought to be using the tools that God gave us. Huh? Because not just sincere milk of the word, but start discerning. When you hear a sermon, when you hear a preaching, my you need to discern. And if there's something wrong, and I tell I tell people all the time, listen, if I say something and you don't fully understand it, you're free to ask me a question, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stand behind. I tell you what, I'm God's man and you can't ask me. And if you do, you're out of here. &gt;&gt; It was so funny. I was preaching back east the other day and I said, you know, I was talking about I said, "Hey, you have a right. You have a right. You know, if the minister and if he's saying something, you have a right, go ask him where'd he say it. Where's that in the Bible?" I don't see it just exactly that way. Well, the the the host pastor said, "Brother Ron, you will never know who was just sitting in the congregation as he was preaching this because he throws everybody out of his church if you just if you even ask the question. &gt;&gt; You even question what he said. &gt;&gt; Okay, you're out of here. &gt;&gt; You don't like that, huh? I'm God's man. use of authority over people. Huh? &gt;&gt; Like an umpire. You're out. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Unskillful. Nothing worse than somebody trying to fix it and they're inexperienced. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Huh. &gt;&gt; That's why on Mars Hill, &gt;&gt; Paul comes there and these people are worshiping the unknown God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. And here they are worshiping the unknown god. Paul says, "Hey, you want me to tell you about the that unknown god? I know him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here was an experience. You see, &gt;&gt; when you come in, it's not just preaching a sermon, but it's preaching a sermon that reveals &gt;&gt; the unknown. &gt;&gt; That brings the answer of the question that you've been seeking. Amen. &gt;&gt; In St. John 14, excuse me, 16:es 12-4. I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. &gt;&gt; How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a time delayed reaction. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that God delays his answers to you sometimes? &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple in three days. I'll raise it up. &gt;&gt; They all thought he meant &gt;&gt; the physical temple. &gt;&gt; It wasn't until after the resurrection then they understood meant the temple of his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand that many times you cannot catch what you need to catch because you're not mature enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't learn geometry until you've taken algebra, until you've taken basic math. &gt;&gt; Because one leads to the other, &gt;&gt; right? There's something about mathematics. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a mystery until you catch the formula. &gt;&gt; Once you catch the formula, it's like, "Wow, it don't matter." Because you know the formula. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth has come, he will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? You need the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we need the Holy Spirit in our lives more today than we've ever needed. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Because he's going to show you. Look, the Bible says he'll show you things to come. He shall glorify me for he shall receive a mine and shall show it unto you. &gt;&gt; St. John 4, Jesus had gone, went into town. Verse 30, then they went out into the city and came unto him. The meanwhile his disciples prayed to him, saying, Master, eat. And he said to them, "I have meat to eat that you know not of." &gt;&gt; They asked him, "Lord, we went into the city here. Here's something to eat." He said, "I got something. I got meat that you don't know about." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Therefore said the disciples one to another, "Hath any man brought him an Uber Eats? Did somebody bring him something and we didn't know it? And Jesus saith unto him, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work." That's my meat. And that's your meat. To have God's word revealed to you so much &gt;&gt; that you understand that's the will of God for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That when you read your Bible and it begins to talk about a woman and her placing and a woman shouldn't cut her hair that's given to her for her glory. That's God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you understand God's will and it's revealed to you, it's your meat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's a it's a substance. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it's a substance. I'm eating of something. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why people they look at us and they think we're legalistic because of the way we dress and we don't go do this and we're not out here socially drinking and all of this. No. No. I'm in love. &gt;&gt; I fell in love. I did. I I I I fell in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "If you love me, &gt;&gt; you keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Show me somebody who does not keep his commandments. They don't love him. &gt;&gt; They talk about him. &gt;&gt; They honorth him with their lips, but their heart is far from him. That's right. &gt;&gt; In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, and I'm speaking to us ministers, speaking to myself. God forbid that we make this message creeds and dogmas &gt;&gt; and dos and don'ts &gt;&gt; and legalists. No. Let me get you to where you fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think, and I've told you this before, one of the most wonderful quotes I ever heard, Brother Brand, and it was just the way he said it. He said, "Father, let your people love me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I can bring them to you. &gt;&gt; Paul said, When it's all said and done, &gt;&gt; when everything's I know one thing, &gt;&gt; and it's Jesus Christ and him crucified. &gt;&gt; It's what it's all about. You know, the main theme of the Bible is Christ, the mystery of God revealed. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know that the types and shadows all the way from Genesis to Revelation is understanding it is the Christ of God. &gt;&gt; Who do they say that I the son of man am? Some said Jeremiah is one of the prophets. Peter, who do you say that I am? In one of the gospels, he said, "Thou art the Christ of God, he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you, &gt;&gt; but your father which is in heaven, &gt;&gt; and upon this rock I'll build my church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm asking every one of you, check your life. &gt;&gt; Are you in love with Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this messenger and I can't wait to hug his neck &gt;&gt; honestly &gt;&gt; and I will thank him for the hours of ministry and the sleepless nights and all of the the sweat and the toil and labor as a minister &gt;&gt; to to take and preach sermons &gt;&gt; and store up spiritual food in due season because you know what? Nearly every day I take that spiritual food up and I put it on and I listen &gt;&gt; and it feeds me &gt;&gt; and I say no man spake like this man. &gt;&gt; It's feeding my soul. &gt;&gt; Not something up here and fancy this and that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hebrews chapter 7. It's time this little church could take meat and no more the milk of the word. We've been too much in the milk now. &gt;&gt; Giving the baby his bottle. We got to have strong meats for the day is getting close. &gt;&gt; Great perilous times are at hand &gt;&gt; and more trouble laying in the road. And we know there'll never &gt;&gt; be better times. &gt;&gt; It's getting worse. &gt;&gt; Darkness is getting worse. &gt;&gt; I can't promise you. Yeah. Don't don't don't think Trump's going to make it better. We're going to make America great again. Sorry. America's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's history. &gt;&gt; She has swn so much that she'll never &gt;&gt; She's reeling like a drunk man. &gt;&gt; You ever seen a drunk man down the road? &gt;&gt; About ready to fall over &gt;&gt; America. They have found out that the brother Ram said all politics is corrupt. It's all corrupt. Look at what they're finding out. That this ex-president, he did this and give away millions of dollars and they took millions and this and that and all this and Trump is trying to say, "Well, look at this guy. He stole this money and this and that." Well, it's all corrupt. &gt;&gt; You can't, you know, in Holland, you know, they got that that story of the little Dutch boy that put his finger in the dyke. Do you know when I went to Holland I asked I because they had got dikes everywhere. Holland it comes from Naland. Naland land from under Netherland. Naland. We took back the ocean. We made a dyke. We put windmills up there and we got all of the water out. So it's Naland. And I said, "Well, where is the dyke? We went through the these pl all these dikes and you go miles of and everything and and here's the sea on the other side." I said, "Well, the story of the boy with the finger in the dyke, the little Dutch boy." He said, "I've never heard it." I ask a lot of those the people from Holland, "What about the Dutch boy with a finger in the dyke?" Well, let me tell you, I feel like sometimes people are trying to put a finger in the dyke when the dam's breaking. &gt;&gt; It's gone. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You can sit here and by the time you plug this one up, this one over here, and pretty soon you got to take your shoes off &gt;&gt; trying to plug every hole, it's gone. &gt;&gt; Don't ever put your money your faith in the money system. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Well, my retirement, &gt;&gt; social security, I can't wait till I get 65 and I'll Hey, it may be gone. &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing less. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus Christ and his righteousness, &gt;&gt; huh? My retirement &gt;&gt; is out of this world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going home. &gt;&gt; I'm going home. Amen. I got my ticket. &gt;&gt; I got the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you got the token? musicians if you come. &gt;&gt; Have you got the token? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to take a trip on a good old gospel ship going far beyond the sky. The other day we took a cruise. It's kind of funny. You go up there and you say, "Hey, I I got a cabin on this cruise." And the people, they they look, they got a roster register with all the names. What' you say your name is again? You ain't on here. I said, "You you better look again." My wife's looking at me like, "Are you got the date right? Is it I said, "No, I I know for sure." Finally, I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was looking in the wrong area. Okay. And we went to get off. They tell everybody if you are going to take your your bags and you want the people to take your bags the night before, put a little tag on it and they'll come collect your bags and then when you get off the ship, your bags will be waiting for you off the ship. Well, Sandy and I, we're going to take our bags with us. And they said, 'If you're if you're getting off by yourself with your own bags, keep your bags with you and everything and then you can go and you can get off. So, we get off and they tell us to go down and how to get off the ship and I've got an older lady. She's got a cane and she's got a little pulley trolley, you know, with a couple handbags and she comes up and the the the guy letting her to get off, he he said, "Uh, ma'am, you can't have somebody carry your baggage for you. You have to take it off yourself." But can't you see? I I need help. She's got a She's got a cane and she's kind of crippled up. She said, "I I need help getting off. Sorry, ma'am. Get out of line and stand right over here." &gt;&gt; I thought, "Oh, God, don't let me come up to the time of let somebody else try to take my baggage." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I'm going to get off, let me carry what I've got. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want somebody to stop me at the at the gate. &gt;&gt; That was so sad, was it not Sandy, to see an old lady. Sorry, ma'am. Stand aside. Oh my. [Music] Amen. I'm done this morning. [Music] I don't need to go any further. You know what I need all of you to do? I need you to seek God in your prayer closet at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; I need you to ask God to give you something through this ministry &gt;&gt; that while I'm up here, because I'll tell you, some of you, some of you go to pulling so hard, you pull the sermon out of me. &gt;&gt; It's you. It's not me. It's you. How about your faith? &gt;&gt; How about you saying, "Oh, God, I need you to speak to me. Use Brother Ron's voice. &gt;&gt; Speak to me. Give me an answer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to pull it out of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Andreas Ringan, he's been here. He gave his testimony years ago. I'm I'm finishing with this. Been a few times in my life I've had a vision, an actual vision. I wasn't dreaming. I was wide awake. I saw it. I saw this vision. I I heard the sermon I'm preaching. I saw the the crowd. I saw the people. I saw these girls sitting on the front row. It was in a house meeting with and the place was packed with youth. I told my wife, I said, "I had a vision this morning." I said, "The Lord showed me. I heard what I was preaching on and everything. [Music] And [Music] when I walked in that morning, you know what, Josh? I walked into the vision. I was in it. &gt;&gt; I I stepped into the vision. And it was so powerful because you know what? I'm in the vision here. Here, here I here's the girl sitting. Here's the people. Here's the setting. This is just like you showed me, Lord. And there was one young boy that was back about sitting about where you're at, Brother Roger. And I said, "Young man, stand up and say that you love the Lord." And these young girls are interested to see who I'm talking to. So they turned around and looked and they when they saw who I'm pointing to, he's the worst young boy in the group. He's the rebel. He's the elder son. He's been out carousing. He's everything. And the night before he came to the service, he got so moved of God that he went up into the hoft above where they feed the cows. Throw the fodder down to the cows. And he said, "God, I need to know. Is this real?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I have such a feeling. I don't want some emotion. I want reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I need to have a sign. I need you to give me a sign, God. &gt;&gt; I need you to have brother Ron call me out and say, "Stand up and say you love the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Stand up and say you love the Lord." &gt;&gt; These girls look and they start laughing like, "Boy, did is your discernment off, pastor? &gt;&gt; Minister, did you ever blow it?" Because this is the worst guy in the group. And all the young people knew it. And brother Andreas, the Holy Spirit come over him and he starts crying. Now everybody shuts up. Nobody's laughing now. All of a sudden he said, "Oh," he said, "God dealt with me last night and I asked God for a sign. He received his son. Now he's a pastor. Now he's a minister. &gt;&gt; This is what you need to do. Get in your prayer closet. Ask God. &gt;&gt; Ask God if you love me. Give me a sign. [Music] God said, "Put me to the test. Is my arm too short? Do I not hear your prayer? [Music] I want all of you to pull the sermon when I get into a channel and God is anointing and you know it's not me. My twin brother told me something and he's my twin brother. He's my wombmate. We know one another and my brother doesn't agree in different things. He said, "When I go to your church and I watch you preach," he said, "I see when it's no longer my brother." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Rav, I see you change. I see God anointing the gift. [Music] Brother Brennham said, "You think it's me that operates this gift?" He said, "It's you." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's you, your faith. You're reaching out." He said, "It's you causing it." &gt;&gt; Some of you have come to me after a service and said, "Brother Ron, that was exactly what I needed. It was so much what I needed. You were speaking directly to me. &gt;&gt; Who told you? &gt;&gt; Nobody told me. &gt;&gt; What it was is God. All of a sudden, God's using my voice. He's speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll happen, my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; if you'll have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you would like a a touch from God? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some kind of little some flash in the pan that tomorrow it's gone. [Music] &gt;&gt; But I need a change. I need the Holy Spirit to move in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see a couple people standing. Is there anybody else that says, "I want to reach out. &gt;&gt; I want to reach out. &gt;&gt; Don't stand up unless you mean it." &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] If my people who are called by my name, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; if they will pray, will they not hear from God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his word. &gt;&gt; That's not me. That's him. &gt;&gt; If you'll take God at his word, &gt;&gt; you want God to touch you and take you higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. All you got to do is ask. Asking. And when you have that faith inside of you, have faith to believe. &gt;&gt; I'm asking. And I'm believing you're going to take me higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm kind of homesick for a country. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Mark, would you help me on that?
