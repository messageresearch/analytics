we thank you for the worship this evening and we ask now that by the foolishness of preaching that lives would be changed that lives would be encouraged Lord that we would receive whatever it is that we're in need of bless your people this evening I ask for thy Kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of First Kings chapter 21 we'll read verses 1-6 thank you so much musicians we just greet you all in the lovely name of Jesus Christ and it's certainly an honor and a privilege to be here this evening can you say Amen am amen First Kings CH 21 we'll read verses 1-6 and it came to pass after these things that Nebo the jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in jezel hard by the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria that means it was close to his Palace and Ahab spake onto nebba say give me thy Vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near onto my house and I will give thee for it a better Vineyard than it or if it seem Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in money and Nebo said unto Ahab the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers onto thee and Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because uh of the word which Nebo the jezrael had spoken to him for he had said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread amen you may be seated this evening in the presence of the Lord I would like to title my sermon this evening this is nebus Vineyard part two and I would like to take for uh subject your inheritance amen whenever we read our Bible uh brother Bram often has taught us he he said don't read your Bible as you're reading a newspaper or a story book in other words he said don't read your Bible on surface level don't just read it like like it's some kind of fation story or or just some people of history but he told us to read between the lines whenever we read our Bibles and he said it's of great importance of for us to whenever we read our Bibles to read with understanding and to read with Revelation to read between the lines to understand the the shadows and the types of what the scripture is talking about because when we miss the shadows and the types especially in the Old Testament uh we pretty much miss the whole Testament uh because the Old Testament is is always pointing towards something else whenever we see a a a story whether it be the high priest or whether it be Abraham and Sarah and and so on and so forth though it was it was their life and though it was them acting out their part in Christ yet the Old Testament was always pointing towards a future event though it was real for them yet it was for a future event like you and I that we could read it with understanding and not only read it but relate to the story of what we're reading so it can be applied to our lives in this very day so if we just read it as a story book and if we just read it uh uh word for word and verse for verse and forget to read between the lines there's no hope for us really of applying the type to our lives and so and and that's like very important for us as Believers is we want to take the word and we want to understand the word we want to take the word and we want to apply the word because when the word is applied the word becomes life excuse me here we go you're okay until you start preaching and so we find out that that's why it's so important for us uh this message is so important for us as Believers because when we read our Bibles and I've I've said it quite often and I'll continue to say it because I believe that it's the truth that it's important for us to read our Bibles through prophetic Insight through the glasses of a a a prophetic messenger in this day because when we read the scripture through prophetic Insight it is actually the very Mind Of God that's being translated to you and I of this scripture that we are reading and so there's no higher order than what God reveals the word than through his servants the prophets so when we're listening to tapes when we're studying a sermon we're listening to what brother brandham said we're not just letting it go through one ear and out the other ear but we've got to ponder upon those things and when he teaches us a type within the scripture we must lock the type in our hard drive and say wow brother brandham said that this symbol means this so whenever you read your Bible and you see the symbol within the scripture it's not the symbol it's the mystery that's hidden beneath the symbol is what we want to understand amen and in the sermon the restoration of the Bride tree brother brandham said she is sitting here on the throne today in this country remember just like Ahab did and Jezebel behind him the Bible calls the Catholic Church Jezebel prostitute did were we able to get the quotes brethren we were was it up there look at that I need eyes in the back of my head because it wasn't up there I apologize so we see then that every time that we see the scripture about Jezebel our our mind should be going back to a brother brandham and seeing the mystery behind the type of Jezebel and understand that it's talking about the Catholic Church yes it's talking about Jezebel but it's also talking about another Spirit that's behind Jezebel cuz brother Bram said this people die but Spirits do not die so the spirit of Jezebel lives on today just as strong as it was back when it dwelt inside Jezebel herself just as the Holy Spirit God will take the man off the scene but the holy spirit is still here praise the Lord that's why the promise is onto you and to your children and to your children's children he never takes the promise away even when the man goes off the scene Hallelujah so when we read about Jezebel we are reading about the Catholic church so when we read in Revelation CH 2 and verse 20 it says notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calls herself a prophetes to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to heat eat things sacrificed onto Idols what's it talking about the Catholic church amen it's talking about the Catholic Church here in the tharan church age which is the fourth Church age where where where we understand this spirit that was was was driving this move of religion was driving the religious people of that day to do drastic things in order to get the people to recant and to bow down to a c certain system a certain ideology a certain way of living taking away the Holy Spirit out of the people taking it away from the grasps of the people I should say that they should serve a system rather than God hallelujah Revelation 17 1 through6 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come up hither and I will show Thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication who's it talking about it's talking about this Jezebel spirit is talking about mystery Babylon which we know is who the Catholic church amen not the people but the system brother brandham said this because when you when you begin to uh especially when you go through your church age book and you begin to see the works of the Catholic church and you begin to see uh mystery Babylon the great uh uh the Bible says the great and she has daughters and they're prostitutes and and and if we're not careful we get to have something against the people that's within denominational churches and we get to think and we get to thinking well uh maybe there's nobody saved outside of the Bride of Jesus Christ maybe it's just those who are within the gra uh the the the grasp of the message Under the Umbrella of the message are the only ones that's going to be in heaven in that day which is not true cuz brother brandham said there's good people and every one of those organizations and so it's not up to us to say well it's it's just the message and it's no more but I can say this that that only the bride which is under the umbrella of the message will be in the New Jerusalem only the bride that has the oil and is sealed until the day of her Redemption has a mansion in this New Jerusalem so not everybody even in quotation within the message will be in the New Jerusalem if if they're if they've got if they've had an experience with Christ they'll be in heaven they got eternal life they got no less eternal life than those who have the seal of God but yet they're not within the city walls and so who are we to say well because that person goes there and that church person belongs to that church who are we to get so judgmental and say Well they're not going to make it because they're not like you and I help us Lord I say father help us so we don't get so judgmental against other people amen because we don't know who's God's and who's not God's amen but yet I'll still preach about this against the system not against the people amen thank you Lord and so it says and he carried me away verse three into the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns horns and the woman was arrayed in purple out of all the colors that should be arrayed in she would be array in purple now was it an actual woman that John was seeing yeah it was a woman he wondered at her beauty she was decked in purple but yet it was the spirit of Jezebel mystery Babylon it was the church amen The Mystery of the woman is the church Hallelujah you know most people no doubt they'll read their Bibles and they'll say uh oh yeah here's a woman brother brandham teaches us this a woman in the church a woman in the Bible is a type of the church so what do we do Under the teachings of Malachi 4 every time we see a Woman Within scripture we think church because we're looking at the mystery underneath the symbol that's what I mean like when we take these symbols and these teachings that brother brandham shows us now we don't read our Bible well it's it's just a woman and Sarah was just a woman and this person was just a woman no Sarah and Hagar they were women but there were two churches right there was one spiritual and there was one carnal and the carnal one always persecuted the spiritual one and so because we understand the symbols underneath it we can understand the types within the scripture that plays the whole way down into the end time because it's always the carnal and the religious that persecutes the spiritual because bride cannot persecute bride amen so here was this woman dressed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls and having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication though she looked pretty and she was something to be wandered after yet within herself she was full of filthiness and fornications and Abominations and and and on her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wandered with great admiration wow what a sight this must have been that brother that that that John would would be caught up and he would and he would see these visions and and he would and he would see the the rest of the history of mankind would play out before him in symol form and everything he saw he was writing it down and and I saw this and I saw this woman woman and I and I saw that and I saw a beast and and I saw a red beast and a pale one and and all these different things and and he's just writing as he sees it but yet it's a book of symbols but when we understand the symbols through prophetic Insight now we can understand and and and this is the thing whenever you begin to see uh whenever you understand a spirit you can see its characteristics when it begins to rise up in your own life life and a family member's life are in the life of the church and whenever you can see a spirit and you understand its characteristics then you know you need to do something about it otherwise you're just walking through life with blinkers on not knowing spiritual things I say father give us a little bit of spiritual uh understanding H uh in order to be able to discern an evil spirit when it begins to try to rise up in our lives the exposition of the seven Church ages the thire and age brother brandom says and in this saaran age uh she is a dominating female she is Mystery Babylon she is the great she is Jezebel the false prophetes why because the true female I love how brother brandham does this he he never leaves us ever in uh uh you know in a downer he always brings the opposite side he says why because the true female is submissive to God so why is this church the opposite why is she dominating dominating and domineering and all those different things it's because there is a woman there is a church that is submissive to her God there is a woman who was submissive to the word of God for her day that's why there's so much false out in the world today is because there's somebody that's real there's some that really loves God there's somebody that's really serving God there's somebody that's really applying the word to their lives that's why there's so much fake that's why there's so much hypocrisy that's why there's so much lies within Christianity because the real thing is here but what about this church she is she has cast out the word destroyed the Bibles and worthy essays of The Godly she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over Kings princes and Nations uh controls armies and insists that she is the True Body of Christ and that our Popes are the vickors of Christ she is entirely seduced by the devil wow until she in turn has become the Seducer of others so if she's been seduced by Satan and now seduces others if we have been quickened by the word we can also Quicken others by the same word that we've been quickened by Sir he says she is the Bride of Satan and has produced uh these illegitimate uh child religions all through the Dark Ages she has dominated for over 900 years she plundered and destroyed she killed the Arts destroyed the Sciences produced nothing but death until the light of the truth was almost entirely gone and only the bearest sliver of light remained the oil and the wine had almost ceased to flow but but though she dominated the world kingdoms and demanded that all men find her citizen Citizenship in her there was a little group who belonged to God and their citizenship was in heaven Hallelujah and them she could not destroy they understand that Satan can do whatever he wants to try and to destroy the seed that's within your life but Faith the faith of God the S gen of God in your life will not be over come by Satan it doesn't matter what comes it doesn't matter what goes because greater is he who is within you than he who's within the world they could not be destroyed this Church of Rome was a heathen wicked as Queen uh aalia who tried to destroy all the Royal seed and almost succeeded but God preserved one and of him there came more of the faithful Hallelujah isn't it amazing what God can do with one man in his his hands you know what God can do with you if you would fully Surrender Your Heart to Christ all he needs is one person so God preserved the little flock in that long dark night and of their truth they finally arose a Luther you see Jezebel has always been trying her best to kill the influence of God amongst God's people we find there in the book of Kings when you read it and especially when Elijah has uh there's been the Mount Carmel Showdown and he's ran away from Jezebel in the word and she said uh uh your your life is going to be as the life of those men that you took uh this time tomorrow when he flees and he runs and he goes to a cave and God asks him and he says Elijah what doest thou here why are you here Elijah and Elijah responds and says oh I'm running from my life because the uh all the prophets of the Lord have been slain so we see and and he thought he was the only one that was left and so we see that this this Jezebel or this Spirit of Jezebel if you want to call it that way what did she do she killed the prophets of the Lord for what purpose because she wanted to kill the influence of The Godly Man upon the people of Israel and when she killed the influence of God amongst the People by taking the man off the scene she erected altars onto baale and onto these other gods that she served you see that's what Satan wants to do in this day That's what Satan wants to do in your life the spirit of Jezebel wants to kill the influence of God and godly man in your life and he's going to bring in an altar of other things within your life if you're not influenced by the right thing Satan can rise up amongst a body of Believers a Jezebel spirit and tried to kill the influence of the pastor amongst the people well how does he do that do they uh uh does Satan does somebody rise up or come into the church with a gun and and and and shoot the pastor while he's preaching and and uh and all these different things no what does he do somebody raises up with a root of bitterness in their heart and all of a sudden they start saying things about the pastor about the deacons about the preachers about the associates God forbid huh amen for what purpose because they're anointed by another Spirit that's right and let me share this with you it is not the spirit of God the spirit of God will not cause you to seow a seed of Discord amongst the the church against one another against family members against any member within the church why because bride cannot persecute bride but what happens is when a spirit of Jezebel Rises up within a Believer all of a sudden with their words they kill the influence of the people godly people Godly men and women that God has placed in your life and in my life to see us through to the end so it sounds good and everything but now we have to be spiritual and just say not just say well I agree with that and that is true but now we need to be spiritual and have our spiritual thinking caps on that whenever you hear someone that's trying to kill an influence of somebody else within the church we should know that that spirit is of the wrong kind of spirit it is not the spirit of Christ um we should hold that person and that Spirit accountable that's right Hallelujah well how do you hold a person accountable you take him to the side you say my brother my sister do you realize what you're doing do you realize this is a seed of Discord do you realize what you're planting here in my heart and in everybody else's heart that wants to listen to what you're trying to say you're going to you're going to take the influence of the man of God and you're going to kill it it's not against the man but it's against God Amen because Satan is against God and that's that's what he wants if he can get you to get your uh confidence out of the manil your confidence will soon leave God it's true so now we say Hey brother you know what you're doing is wrong right you know what you're saying here uh you shouldn't be saying it you know you ought to repent and go to that person and say that you're sorry I think if we held each other accountable in a very nice Christian fashion of course amen we don't want to be disagreeable with anybody we want to kill them with love am but say hey hey hey wait a second you're way out left field here let's bring it back let's talk this over like real men let's talk this over like Brethren like like sisters what what are you trying to do here do you realizes oh no I didn't even realize it yeah repent and make it right it's amazing my brother and my sister repentance I really want to preach on repentance sometime true repentance even for a Believer not for this not for the sinner that that comes in and repents and they give their heart to Christ and we all joy no no no you know that uh there be times there when you look at Ahab for instance and God was bringing the judgments upon Ahab through the word of Elijah that Ahab he went oh my my and he he he he he he repented and put sackcloth upon himself and he tore his clothes and he said oh God I I'm sorry I I Repent of what I done I Repent of my works I I repent and what did God tell Elijah to do tell him is not going to come in his day because he repented towards me but it'll be upon his family when I bring these things to pass you know how you get the curse of God off your life you don't have the joy that you used to have you don't have the pray that you used to have you don't have the love for God's people that you used to have there's one thing that'll fix it that's true repentance you repent of whatever it is in your heart let me tell you you'll feel the sweet presence of God come just like just like brother brandham you remember brother brandham said one time uh God you owe me an answer you remember because God didn't give him the answer to the vision or whatever it was and he said my the spirit of God he grieved the Holy Spirit and he walked alone there was no Visions there was no there was no the Lord wasn't close by him he didn't feel his presence until finally he came to a place and he said father I'm sorry you don't owe me nothing amen and all of a sudden what happened the presence of God was with brother brandham one more time thank you Lord why because he repented you remember the time that brother Brandon was under so much pressure in his life the IRS was chasing him down he was being attacked by church and by state doors were closing on him and everything and people were saying all kinds of things about him and about his ministry and he he was getting pressured from all over the place and here he was and the phone rang and sister M said uh I I believe it was a lawyer or the IRS or whoever it was and they're coming after them for signing all these checks and they're saying you got to pay back taxes and all these checks and all these offerings that we've been given you in your name wow what a pressure have you ever been pressured by money before like that huh feel like you're absolutely drowning there he was how am I going to pay this back uh I didn't spend any of this money this money was never mind I I didn't do anything with it but yet he was being attacked by the state he got under so much pressure he said ma tell him I'm not in and here he went and he stepped outside the door and she took the call for us hey that's a daily thing yeah I'm not here you miss a call yeah I'm I'm I'm busy we don't answer it we do something else make up some excuse we lie pretty much oh I didn't hear you what did you say but here he was he had such a walk with God and he steps outside and he steps back in and technically he wasn't in but yet it was the reason behind he did it was wrong the motive was wrong right and so all of a sudden somebody comes for prayer and brings their their little child I believe it was and brought it in he went to pray for him there was a dark sheet that came down he he couldn't pray for the person why because he had done wrong but when he made it right what happened he prayed for that same person and the little kid got well again repentance works wonders in our lives repentance brings us back into the very presence of God again be quick to repent and don't let the sun go down in your wrath not just with your wife not just with your husband but with God Almighty everybody said am Hallelujah so what does what does what does uh Jezebel want to do Jezebel wants to kill the influence but not only kill the influence she wants to erect altars within our lives that we serve other things instead of serving God erects money in our lives an ability to make money erects Sports and music and movies and all these different things and before we realize it we are worshiping the altars of liosia instead of having uh uh a true worship with God in our lives amen he just doesn't want to kill the influence but he wants to change the influence and erect other things in your life be aware of the tactics of this Jezebel spirit but there was an Elijah in that day who not only stood against the system of that day who didn't only erect an altar uh back to where the people would worship God in spirit and in truth again but that Prophet Elijah he had a mount carel experience and after he had rebuilt the altar of God what did he do he he slayed all those prophets all those false prophets of baale that were prophesying and calling upon their God and cutting themselves and every and and all of those different things he took them all over to the edge of the mountain and he slayed them all and kicked them over the edge of the Hill that's what the spirit of Elijah does to the spirit of Jezebel amen he defeats it Elijah is not overcome by Jezebel but Jezebel is overcome by the word of Elijah oh Hallelujah that ought to that ought to make you say Amen because you have a relationship with the Elijah's spirit and if he overcome that Spirit that'll mean that we will also overcome that spirit in this day because we have had a spirit of Elijah what did he come to do he he come to rebuild the stones the altars that was all broken down and once he rebuilt the altars what did he do he was a oneman army amen took the sword of the word he cut this devil's head off this denominational head off cut this one off why cuz he was Paving away for Elisha amen Elijah paved the way for Elisha amen the same mantle and the same stick that was used to cross the Jordan River by Elijah was the same one that was used by Elisha to cross back over it again God is still the same we can use this same word to cross back and forward over Jordan as many times as we want why because the word does not change and the mantle has not lost any power that it once had that's right Hallelujah this Vineyard it's it's a very interesting story it belonged to naboth and you know it really meant something to him you know there's a law written within the word and it's it's the law of inheritance and within this law it it says that if somebody offers you uh you know the money that what it's worth and you take it you don't have to give it back it the person paid what it was worth or if they give you something better Ahab in In fairness was trying to follow the law of inheritance and that's why Ahab was so sorrowful because when naboth wouldn't give him it he he understood hey my hands are tied man there's not nothing I can do about this if this is the the the law of inheritance hey if he won't give it to me for what it's worth he won't give it to me for something better it's his I can't do anything about it but Jezebel had other plans that's right but this this this Vineyard it really meant something to him why did it mean so much to naboth because he understood that it wasn't just his it was passed down it was a multi-generational uh inheritance that was inherited to him through family it was inherited to him through a bloodline and he understood the importance of the inheritance through bloodline that this means something to me this belongs to me and not only does it belong to me but it belongs to my children it belongs to my children's children it it's a promise that's been left of me by Jehovah God for my family and I'm not giving it up understand you don't need to give up on your family members because it is a promise onto you if you would just hold them up in prayer and say father I don't know when but I know you can and I'm believing for it Lord amen but Satan wants you to to let go of the promises of God he wants you to let go of the inheritance of our children uh the promise of our children serving God but nabal said not so I have a promise I have an inheritance that has been paid for by Blood hallelujah it's been passed down through my bloodline and I am not letting go I don't care what you offer me I don't care what you say I don't care what you do it is mine amen somebody say mine mine belongs to you that's right don't give it up that's why the Bible says here in 2 Peter 1:10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall the word diligence it means speed eagerness and earnestness a care or haste in other words the script RT is telling us to be to be quick the need to be quick the need to be eager to have a revelation to understand that to make your calling an election sure because if you don't make your calling an election sure you can't rightly ask what belongs to you as a son or daughter of God if you're not quick and diligent and making haste and saying I know I've had an experience with God I know I'm a son or daughter of God I I know these things if we're not quickly and and knowing it from the bottom of our heart Satan can plant doubt in our minds and when doubt and unbelief is in the heart of a person there's absolutely no way for us to grasp by faith our inheritance and promises that God has left to us amen make haste do it quickly do it be eager about it seek it diligently go after it and understand that if if you're a son or a daughter of God there is a book that is full of great and precious promises there has been an inheritance that has been paid for us by the blood of Jesus Christ that has been left to us for us to grasp and for us to handle but the longer we doubt about who we are and where we came from and where we're going the harder it is for us as Believers to say that promises is mine that part of the inheritance within the word belongs to me and I'm going to take it amen second Peter 1: 2 through four Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things somebody say all things he's given to you all things you don't have to worry about a single thing why because he's given to you all things that pertain onto life onto this natural life he has already given onto you all things that casts out all the fear that casts out all the doubt it doesn't matter what happens what comes or goes why because he has already given unto me by a promise all things pertaining to this life and godliness thank you Lord so whether it's the natural things or whether it's the spiritual things God has already provided it for us that by these by what by these great and precious promis oh through the knowledge of him that has called us to the glory and virtue verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so how are we partakers of the divine nature through the promises of God thank you Lord without the promises of God what written within this word for you and I as Believers there is no way for us to be a part of his divine nature but because of the promises because of these precious and great promises guess what now we can be partakers of his divine nature amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust it's only through the promises of God that we can be partakers of the divine nature of God and to believe that those promises are for you as an individual you must know who you are in Christ as a son or daughter of God have you ever seen somebody that doesn't know who they are who am I where did I come from what am I doing here where am I going that's most college kids did you know that what am I going to do I don't know I'll go to this class no I won't I'll go to this one what what what am I what what am I going to do for a POS I don't know what you're going to do for education or for a job you know what the best thing to do for a job is do something you enjoy brother Robert McGary told me that probably 16 years ago and it's a good piece of advice brother Robert he said find something you enjoy and do it and so here I am where who am I though where did I come from where am I going what am I doing a person who doesn't know you know what they do they just walk in circles I don't know I don't know who I am I I I don't know what's the purpose of life what's the purpose of this do we just are we just born and we eat and we live and we try to enjoy and and then we die and I don't know what happens after that I I I don't know a person who doesn't know they don't know they have no leadership they have no Direction they uh you could tell them you know you could tell a person that they're a son or daughter of God until you're blue in the face until it drops down here they ain't ever going to believe it you can't make somebody believe that they're a son or a daughter of God do you know why because there's too much doubt in their hearts and when there's too much doubt and unbelief in the heart of a person it's hard hard for them to see the things of God and how they're really seeing when faith and unbelief is in the heart the person looks to The Faults and the failures rather than to the promise the person looks to what they're doing wrong rather than what God has already done for them but a True Believer understands yeah I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity and I have so many issues but by the grace of God I am here and by the grace of God I am a son I am a daughter of God and and I'm walking by faith through the grace of Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Lord people can sit in a church chair or a church pew and not know who they are and die in their chair spiritually speaking they can go for years and and hear the sermons and feel the presence of God and feel the anointing of God and and understand scriptural uh principles and doctrines but yet within their hearts there's something missing there's too much unbelief and when God tries to penetrate the heart it's just so hardened that he can't get through why because they don't know who they are am but when you know who you are in Christ Jesus and you have made your calling an an elect sure and you understand the ways of God and you understand that just because I'm having a hard time it doesn't mean that I'm not a seed of God just because I'm troubled in my spirit it doesn't mean that I am not a son or a daughter of God but a son or a daughter of God when they're challenged and troubled they say Father Here I Am I need you they call out to God and that's what he really wants amen they don't die in their chair going to church but they revive through the tribulations why because you know what it does tribulation it brings us back it softens our hearts after you get over the hardness after you get over you know that's why a lot of people that are hard-headed like myself takes a while and God will beat on us and beat on us and you'll feel troubled and you'll feel oh my my goodness this is brutal and but you just put your head down and you just keep going until finally you get father I have had enough of this thing please forgive me I'm sorry if I done something wrong and you begin to make things right there's other people man they are just quick to it father I don't want to deal with this anymore take it away from me that's how we want to be but when you realize who you are and The Inheritance that is left to you as a son or daughter of God the floods will come but they won't affect you as they would with somebody that doesn't know who they are the fire will burn but it won't affect you as it would affect somebody who doesn't know who you are why because we realize that it's for our greater good amen do you see the comparison do you see the difference do you see the importance for us to to understand these things and say wow I understand it I'm making diligent my calling and my election why because I know if I know who I am I can claim what rightfully belongs to me that's right the inheritance that lays within you within the siing of God is greater than the inheritance that your family member has left you in the flesh The Inheritance that lays within you of eternal life is greater than the inheritance that has been left to you from a family member never forget it I'll share this it comes to me this is personal okay very personal so um you've all heard me talk about my my grandma uh my dad's mom okay and and stuff and and I've made the comment that she would tell a lie that would hang you right and so anyways um she passed away a year two years ago mavi and um and so she left this inheritance for everybody and um man they were just finding all this money and everything and she had thousands and thousands of dollars just laying at the house and hidden and and where and she would always say that she was broke and and stuff and it's just this this gets worse and so anyways uh so the family all gets together they have the funeral and everything and you know it's sad and she's passed on and everything and um so now they're reading out uh uh The Inheritance that that that the the two brothers my dad and his two brothers and all the grandchildren has been left I don't know how many of us grandkids are ours seven or eight of us whatever and um and so anyways they're reading it out and they're going through the list and this person got left x amount of thousands and this one got left this thousands this one this one this one this one this one this one well uh my mom my mom says what about my Steven and and was it was my aunt she's well Stephen's name's not on here and um my mom was so mad so mad and she was all how dare she she leaves everybody else something and this and that and and and and she didn't leave my and she get up and she stormed out of the room you know so my mom calls me and she's in tears and she's crying and uh and she told me and I started laughing and uh and um because do you know why CU it doesn't matter amen who cares and so I told my mom I said mom who cares and she goes that's silly cow she started crying she goes I started laughing I said Mom she got the last laugh on you didn't she she's like yes she did she's balling and then she starts laughing and uh The Inheritance within my heart is is far greater than any amount of money that my grandma could have left me it is far above rubies it is far above riches it's so far above it it's absolutely out of this world because you can't buy eternal life and it doesn't matter what you have in this natural life all that matters is the spiritual SE Gene of God that lays within you praise the Lord hallelujah so they enjoyed their money well I'm enjoying things that are far greater praise the Lord that's right thank you Lord ah man that one struck me that was good you might have felt it but I felt it maybe because it was for me who cares about that other stuff amen who cares who left you water who left someone else something or your family heritage or your family bloodline according to the flesh those things don't matter the only thing that matters is your spiritual bloodline is your spiritual heavenly father because he's the one that's we're going to live eternity with up there that's right praise the Lord wonderful and God could take uh black sheep of the family like me they all hated me and they had every right to hate me too yeah pill popping drugie all these guys you know they were the goodie two shoes raised in a bubble never done nothing wrong I'm like 12 years old and I'm running the streets and I shared that's all right out here running the streets and doing my own thing and and and everything and he's my other cousins and you know yeah oh we never do anything wrong oh Stephen yeah this and that and family likes to talk don't they yeah I could care less I was going to thump my cousin one time something kept me from it I don't know what it [Applause] was yeah prise the Lord yeah and then um 18 years old and gave my heart to the Lord and things start to change in my life yeah guess what these guys start doing start going off the Rockers ah they finally got a little bit of got away from the legalism from Mom and Dad at home and started doing things when my cousins went out and the teacher gave him a bad grade cuz he deserved to have a bad grade and he went out and put the windows out in his car yeah good for you like what so all of a sudden they go off The Rock or how the tables turn let me let me say this to you parents and to myself you see other kids that are that are going off and and and having a hard time within within the families of the church keep your mouth shut because you don't know when the tables will turn and it might be your kids at some point and it might be my kids at some point and you wouldn't want anybody saying that about you so you keep your mouth off other people's families and other people's children and other people's marriages and you take it before God Amen woo yeah do it everybody will be happier your brother will love you a little more Hallelujah excuse me prise God by adoption number number four brother brandom says look has predestinated us onto this inheritance if I'm a a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and saying William brandham I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me amen so though the promise was there and though there was an inheritance before the foundation of the the world until it was known by Revelation from God you can't claim your inheritance because there was nothing I could do to inherit inherit it it was black it was Val it was blank it was valid there's nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sent his own in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance you want to know what your inheritance is the sunship to be a Son of God hallelujah you see brother Stephen that's too simple that's what your inheritance is is to be a Son of God not just here in this Earth but when we cross over and we get into that Heavenly Jerusalem and there's no more sin sickness or shame your inheritance is to be a son or a daughter of God thank you Lord your inheritance is made known to you by revelation of the Holy Spirit your inheritance doesn't start when you get across the other side but your inheritance starts right here right now loud seea evening Life Fellowship as you go about your daily business your inheritance starts now you don't have to wait wait for it it's not something that's off in the future that you're trying to reach for no it's right here written within the word of God praise the Lord praise the Lord but it's given to you in parts so when God has given to you your inheritance he gives he doesn't give it to you all at once he once you're sealed of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he just doesn't take you out of here and and and and and that's it and you've got no more trials or trip no he doesn't give it to you all at once but he gives it to you in Parts in little pieces at the very beginning he reveals himself to you as Jehovah savior he reveals to you your inheritance in Jesus Christ to be a son or a daughter of God and as you go through life's journey he reveals and he gives to you a little bit more of your inheritance and he reveals himself as Jehovah nessi he reveals himself to you as Jehovah jarra I will provide all your needs what is it it's a piece of your inheritance that he's giving onto you a little piece of himself of Jehovah Nissi and Jehovah Rafa and Jehovah Shalom and and and and all these different great attributes of God he doesn't give it to you all at once but he gives it to you as is needed amen he doesn't reveal it all at once because you can't handle it you can't understand it all at once so at an appointed time sir he reveals himself and he gives you this piece of your inheritance at an appointed time he gives you this piece of your inheritance at an appointed time when you're sick and body he says you're in need of a he Healing Touch in your body here I am Jehovah Nessie I Am The God Who heals all of your diseases at God's appointed time too much of the time we are caught up with our timing and when is it going to happen but if God had an appointed time with you for salvation he has appointments made out for you along your journey whether it's a provider for this whether it's a healing in the body whether you need a paycheck whether you need this whether you need comforted whatever it may be at an appointed time in your life's journey amen he says here look it here's here's a piece of your inheritance I'm going to give it to you this is your appointment this is your time take it and eat it and receive it here it is it's for you and he never stops giving his inheritance to his children because guess what my cousins they probably done spent all that money already amen I got a blank checkbook man Hallelujah and I can sign and it's already been sealed and it's already been signed by the pair in the blood of Jesus Christ and I can take that thing and I can write whatever I want on it at my appointed time right why because it's my inheritance and it belongs to me thank you Lord hallelujah I want you to know never forget you know this already God always keeps his appointments he's never too early he's never too late but he is an ontime God and so we find out that a lot of our prayers is God help me and God do this for me and and God and help me and God God God but as we mature in our Christian walk now our prayer changes to where it says now we are touched by the feelings of the infirmities of the other people within the assembly and that when one person hurts the rest of the body hurts and our prayer now changes from praying for ourselves to father I pray for that other person father I pray for that person's child father I pray for that person's marriage I pray for whatever that person is going through Lord and and I ask father that you would have an appointment with them amen amen when you begin to pray for other people over yourself it shows maturity in your Christian walk that's right Hallelujah just like Abraham stood in the gap for lot just like Moses when he stood in the Gap and and he said he said Lord just take me don't take the children of don't take the children it's not them Lord let me let me stand in the gap for them Father what was it it was a sign of maturity of putting other people's needs before our very own needs us Lord that's the sign of a mature Christian in the body of Christ amen as the musicians come the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride now the Divine architect has designed the new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the apostles said Eye Has Not Seen ear has not heard or neither has entered the heart of man let's see if we can probe into it just for a moment see what it's going to look like the Divine architect has designed this for his beloved what a faithful God Amen oh what a place it must be when divine nature a Divine

beautiful and wonderfully Heaven this New Jerusalem is going to be for the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know I tried to imagine it within my mind what's it going to be like I and I couldn't do it and the only thing that that I could think of within my mind was Jesus and I thought you know that's right that's really what's in here it's not the Mansion it's not the streets of gold it's not all these things that we picture in our mind of great Splendor and beauty and fantastic and it's Jesus amen and I thought my how I want to see him yes and look upon his face oh to sing forever of his Saving Grace on the streets of Glory let me praise His name and I thought I just want to see him I just want to hug him the other I don't care that was really what was in my my heart I got a mansion with my name on it man that' be a bonus get all these other things yeah sure that would be so nice I'm not downgrading it but to see him face to face Amen to hug him to see the scars in his hand that were made there just for [Music] me what a mighty God that can take a Wretch like you and [Music] I from a life of sin guilt and shame and he can change it he can change the heart he can change your direction that you're walking in in this life and reveal to you who didn't know anything about God that you are his I thought that's what it's all about my brother and my sister we have an inheritance of God that doesn't start over there but it starts right now and I want you to know that you can tap into your inheritance at any given time no matter what time of the day it is are the we hours of
