life to watch your reaction [Music] it's easy to have a smile and a Victory when everything's going good but when you're in the midst of a trial well it seems like a dark cloud is hanging over you it went when you're like job and you say I go forward he's not dare I go backwards I can't behold anymore where is he I want you to understand he is there whether you feel him whether you see him he said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world I believe God's going to speak to somebody this morning I believe I could call your name out right now I do I believe I could call some people out right now that God put it on my heart to let you know that God is mindful of what you're going through you say well I'm going through something nobody knows it and but he knows it and he put it on my heart so if you listen carefully will you listen if God's going to speak will you listen and say father speak to me I have need and oh God I need you in the midst of all of this I need you to come because you're Jehovah Jireh you're a God that provides all of our needs Heavenly Father Lord As I Lay My Hands upon this Sovereign book men of old were were moved of the Holy Ghost they said things father that they did not understand they penned it down not knowing really what it what time who it would be to fulfill it but father that's the Holy Spirit moved upon men of old to write these scriptures then it takes up moving again in our day to have that word come to light to come to fruition that our eyes of understanding would understand what is for our day what is our day what is our message Father because the light that is given to us in this hour is the light that we must walk in for we know that your children walk in the light because God is light illuminate father our minds and our understanding this morning shine upon places father the word has never illuminated before let us know who we are where we're going and what our purpose is here father I praise you and I thank you I ask it For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen turn around Shake somebody's hand welcome them to the house of the Lord this morning hallelujah thank you musicians God bless you amen turn with me if you would in your Bibles Hallelujah amen through it all I've learned to trust in him second Samuel 22. verses 29 through 33 we welcome you all this morning in the name of the Lord brother Robert has welcomed all of you but I also too want to take a moment say thank you and God bless you and Robbie Lynn and Clint and Bob and Camille Decker God bless you my my my what a blessing to see you guys amen they go back a long ways with us back when we were in Silsbee Texas and so ah praise the Lord and the rest of you we go back a long ways with like one brother met me at the airport one time got off the airport there in Frankfurt Germany Brother on we've met before ah I don't know you know I've traveled a little bit Yeah nah man we met before a long time ago I'm racking my mind and well where was it just give me a hint or something like this and he got me all flustered and everything because I don't like to to meet somebody that they recognize me and I don't recognize them and yes we met and everything he said before the foundation of the world ah yeah being late came on you ain't never gonna catch me in that one again go back a long ways each and every one welcome you all in the name of the Lord may God bless his word this morning to our hearts second Samuel are you there chapter 22. second Samuel 22 verses 29 through 31. for thou art my lamp O Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect the way of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect somebody say perfect now say that's me amen believe it God bless you and be seated now in the presence of God is my strength and my power and he maketh my way perfect now I want you to understand God is not the author of confusion nor of frustration God will never ask of you to do something that you have no ability to be able to do it or even if you are unable he is able so God will never ask you to be perfect without making a way for that perfection so I thank the Lord in that because I tend to look at myself and I'm striving to be better I'm striving to be a better husband to be a better father to be a better Christian to be a better Pastor to just be better and there are times when I frustrate myself because I make mistakes I know all of you are sitting there and it probably popped your bubble and you thought that I am perfect but I'm here to tell you that I'm just like you and that's how it was even with the men of old the Bible says they were men of like passion they went through the same things you went through Paul said I was the chiefest of Sinners do you think he was lying he just didn't elaborate amen I thank God for his grace and his Mercy now when I think about this Perfection that God is requiring of us I then began to quandary in my mind to begin to question father you said be ye perfect as the Lord your father in Heaven is perfect and I thought wow if there's anybody that looks at himself and realizes I fall short of perfection it is myself and so I uh uh if I'm not careful what I do is I'm too hard on myself or any of you that way that you're kind of hard on yourself you make a mistake well if you know I talk to myself all the time if you son had any brains at all if I won't tell you the rest of this stuff I tell me because sometimes I think it's not edifying but I do get it myself and if if uh I saw a man had had he'd drawn a machine um how that you could um you could take care of some of your frustrations it was a kicking machine he had a rope out in front of him and you could do pull down on a rope when you did you had to boot behind you and it was kicking you sometimes I would like to have that thing hey come here Ronald you should know better but we have to understand something you do make mistakes and if there's anything that you can do to make it right then Jesus Christ died in vain Jesus Christ came to save The Sinner he came to set you free from yourself he came to set you free from the things that seem to to hold you back and God is expecting you to believe his word amen he is my strength and my power and he makes my way perfect Job chapter 11. and then I will go to Second Corinthians 13. job 11. verse 4. for thou Hast said my Doctrine is pure and I am clean in thine eyes but oh that God would speak and open his lips against thee that he would show Thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is know therefore that God exacteth Of Thee less then thine iniquity deserves somebody say praise God is going to exact from you less than what you deserve then why are you so hard on everybody else when you look down at others and say they made this mistake this and that you know what God I tell you what take him the task well I'll tell you what when it comes to you you're always asking for Mercy oh God give this self-righteous attitude out of our minds and out of our our thoughts that we would look at others like God wants to look at us through the blood Hallelujah verse 7 counts thou by searching find out God can still find out the Almighty unto perfection it is as high as heaven I love this you talk about this Perfection it's as high as heaven what can thou do deeper than hell what can't thou no the measure thereof is longer than the Earth and broader than the sea talk about God's perfection second Corinthians if you would turn with me and then we'll take our text and launch off into the service this morning second Corinthians chapter 13. verse 9 and 11. for we are glad when we are weak for ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection therefore I write these things being absent lest being present I should use sharpness according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you may God bless the reading of his word this morning I have an awful lot that is upon my heart and I need the Lord to give me words to be able to give them to you I'd like to title my sermon this morning God's provided way of perfection and I'd like to take a subject it's God perfecting the bride in the third pool he says you know you all know what that third pull is it's identified before you he said it's in me now he said watch when the time comes and the squeeze begins to come on he said what you've seen temporarily shall manifest in the fullness of its power he said therefore I must be quiet silent I must be backing off nothing sinful you know just waiting for that moment I feel we should all be having a reverent time before God I know you are calling me to something far greater than what I am the prophet speaks about the word perfection 248 times in his ministry he talks about having perfect faith he talks about a perfect Rapture he talks about a perfect God and he talks about having perfect love not uh filial love but an agapola he said because none of you will make it unless you have that Godly love amen I feel that many times we fall short of having that Godly love not just for God but for one another in one of the last sermons and I have it a lot this morning and I'm going to do some reading and in doing this what it does is I believe saints of God this way to perfection God gave us the remedy of this the formula to this through the prophet's message he's showing you he's telling you how you can come to Perfection are you interested in that amen so in one of the last sermons he preaches in 65 on the things that are to be I am only going to read the highlighted portion you read the rest of the quote when you get home it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said ye be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand now and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen says that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood and the word of God bleeding word to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated listen to me she's not a forgiven woman she is fully justified in the eyes of God as though she never did it in the beginning not forgiven fully Justified she never sinned in the first place now this wording here that brother Brown says it is called the Waters of separation I want you to understand that this message let me paraphrase it and say is the Waters of Separation in this hour God is using this prophet's message to wash the bride he said if I can get her to stand still long enough and if I he says and get her to pay attention I will dress her with the word hallelujah are you ready this morning bride to be stand and dressed Hallelujah that's Esther how do I know how to dress the king's servant will tell you yes sir if you're listening I'll tell you it's not with the world it's not with the fashion it's not with all those things he will tell you it will be a modest apparel it will be something that will please the king not a flash amen now during our last service I as I told you and just to reiterate just for a moment the Bible says that there are four men in the Bible that were perfect before God Noah Abraham and job but there was another one a fourth one that we've never really looked at that I told you his name was the king of Tyrus he says thouest in the garden of God that was perfect in all thy Beauty all thy ways when when thou was created was perfect and King Tyrus was just a man he was just an image of something far greater he said when that Prophet began to speak there to the king of Tyrus what he was doing he was speaking to Satan in that man and he said Satan dwells in a perfect Beauty he said now watch God is Not dwelling in Beauty he dwells in character take not your beauty from the world that's why all of the women in the world they have to try to stay up with beauty from the time of 18 the prophet of God says 18 to 20 years of age whether it be the men or the women guess what you start to die your body no matter how much you you you lift the weights no matter how much you run no matter how much you try to eat or or put it moisturizer on your face and try to take care of the wrinkles let me tell you age is coming and those movie stars and actresses and the different ones how vain it is for beauty is vain and how if it weren't for the doctors and the and the makeup artists and and all of the uh those guys that do the skin graft whatever they call plastic surgeons yeah they feel those guys as pockets with the desire to want to stay and look perfect let me tell you the only thing that God is requiring out of you is not being perfect in looks but in character God expects your character to ex far exceed that of your physical appearance because if God only accepts those who are of good found countenance than some of us ain't gonna make it huh let's face it but thank God he's not looking at the outward God is looking at the n-word let me tell you some of you have uh don't have that outward Beauty as the world would say it but I'll tell you your character far exceeds anything that is with that our beauty that will fade it will go away but your beauty that you have is an Inward and it's going to get more charactered and more christ-like and and better and More Beautiful every day that you grow in Christ somebody say Amen to that now this term perfection in the Old Testament the Hebrew word means without blemish it means to be complete to be full perfect undefiled upright morally undefiled in the New Testament the word perfect comes from the root word teleos meanings having reached an end a destination a goal so when God says they want you to come to Perfection it's actually a destination are we together on that now and so if it's a an and a goal a destination then God's got to make a way for you to get there because he would make you totally frustrated and feel so unfulfilled within yourself if you try and cannot Attain so what God does is he's making an unconditional Covenant with the Seed of Abraham amen with the Seed of Abraham the faithful seed that comes by faith in Jesus Christ amen he makes a way for them he is a Waymaker so understand God has called all of his seed for a purpose to open your eyes of understanding that's why you're here this morning the little thread that kind of sows all of us together is the fact that God has sent a message and we've been enlightened we've been quickened to our understanding of what God has done in this hour so all of you have been called for a purpose God allows you to have a career God allows you to have a business or something in order for you to provide for your family but that's not your purpose what good is it if a man gains the whole world and loses his soul Jesus said therefore bringing him back to the the the thing that's most preeminent seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things houses lands what you going to eat what you going to wear huh will be added to you so the very first thing you need to seek is his kingdom the ministry of Christ listen to me not the ministry of Jesus the ministry of Christ now Christ means the anointing the ministry of the word the logos thought of God any beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh so we understand but he said that logos had a concept and that concept was the mystery of God to be revealed he said now God could not do it as great Jehovah God he's too mysterious these two all-powerful you could not grasp it so God condensed it down God came down and he became a form that we could look we could see we could understand Jesus did not come to reveal himself the sole purpose for Jesus Christ was to reveal the father I can do nothing except the father reveal it the disciples asked him one time show us the father he said how many sermons do I have to preach how many tapes you have to listen to How many times you have to read your Bible how many times you have to get on your knees and ask God if you've seen me you've seen the father because I and my father are one it's not three gods in heaven it's not father Son and Holy Ghost there's one God spoke to Moses tell my people hear o Israel the Lord your God is one [Music] every sea Gene will come to an understanding in your life you personally God revealing himself to you every one of you have got to come to that place you do not get to that place because you were born in a message family or into a Christian home or into a Christian Church you must have your experience with God yourself Jacob is a perfect example of a man who is born in a Godly message family Abraham is his grandfather Isaac is his father he has heard all of the stories he sat on Grandpa's knee he heard about when he met Melchizedek he heard all the stories no doubt Abraham was overcome and tears had come down his eyes about how that God had met him oh you should have been there when God told me stay the hand to Abraham for and now I know you love me but it never changed Jacob's life Jacob had had many Bethel experiences and I'm afraid there's so many within the message today that they only have Bethel experiences that's okay you can see Angels ascending and descending you can see appearances you can feel anointings but it must come to a time of a personal wrestling with God Amen where Jacob grabbed a hold of that angel and said tell me your name and give me a blessing and the angel said let me go why do you want my name what is your name and the angel tries to get away from him let me tell you there are times in your life you're going to have to wrestle for the blessing you want and if you're not willing to wrestle for it you ain't getting it amen that God don't just play this is not playing church sometimes you have to say God you have to get into that desperation you have to say oh God I need you now more than ever stay with me and there he wrestled with God face to face the Bible says and he called the name of this place peniel I have met God face to face every one of you and the reason that Jacob two things that happened to him changed his name what is your name my name is Jacob no he said that's your birth name that's your birth name Jacob means shyster supplanter that's not who you are I got another name a name that was given to you before the foundation of the world your name Shall be Called Israel because thou art a prince with God and he touched him on the Hall of his thigh and Jacob the rest of his life for Witness every day his walk you'll know about your walk when you've wrestled with God this is for somebody this morning it is the ministry of Christ that perfects the bride it is not the prophet it is not the tapes it is not the ministry it is your relationship between you and Jesus Christ personally can we say Amen to that and so even the new birth is Christ making himself known to you personally when you read your Bible you have to put yourself in those scriptures and brother Billy when you were in in prison there in Mexico you read a scripture and I think you were referring to Isaiah and the man the prisoner next to you you put his name and you read his name and he said really is my name there because what happened all of a sudden the man well you mean to tell me I'm a part of that oh Hallelujah if by revelation of the Holy Spirit behold I send unto you Elijah be all I send unto you John behold Sarah behold Judy behold all of the different ones behold I send unto you can you put your name there I make it personal listen the ministry of Christ is a quickening Ministry not the ministry of Jesus that's the man but I want to take you all the way back because the ministry of Christ the anointing the logos thought is what quickens every seed from Genesis to revelation when Abel needed a sacrifice he was quick what was it that quickened the anointing there was an anointing that came over him wow B a lamb an altar a vision I saw it God you see when God reveals himself to you it's as a vision why because your mind's eye of understanding is illuminated wow now I know and so he he he he he he does according to the vision what is it it's the anointing of Christ brother Randolph said it is the identified Christ of all ages there was Christ and David who cried my bones they stare at me it was Christ and Jeremiah it was Christ in Ezekiel it was Christ and job it was Christ in every character and if it was Christ in all of them it's got to be Christ in you okay the Apostle Paul said it's no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live I live by the faith of the son of God and then he confesses oh when I try to do good evil is present with me and that which I don't want to do that I do any of you ever been there when you try to do good Evil's present with you and you wind up doing the thing you didn't want to do and that I need to say oh God forgive me then you wish you had that little kicking machine you want a bulldozer well you may get one be careful with you when you make a mistake and you do wrong isn't it hard to forgive yourself I'm speaking to somebody here this morning isn't it hard for you to say you know because really it's hard to even ask for forgiveness because I did it and I knew better and I shouldn't have done it but I did it so now in this anointing in this quickening power it is going to reveal to you Christ The Mystery of God that's why he comes this Christ anointing on you brother Brown said in the questions and answers on Genesis that was called by Bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing that part of God began to develop into something so human beings could have some some type of an idea what it was it was a little low little light movie that was the word of God in the sermon why brother rev said we realize that God that logos or the pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness that was Christ that was the anointing I want to ask you that same Pillar of Fire has shown itself once again in this our day and we are not following a man we are not following a prophet We are following the pillar of Fire because when the fire moved Moses moved with it when the fire stopped when it became a cloud they they made up camp Oh my brother my sister realized we are not following a man God does not have you follow a man he has you follow himself you have been predestinated before the foundation of the world to hear the word of God for this hour that's right God came looking for you you weren't looking for God I can't God came looking for you acts 13 verse 48 when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed they weren't tucked into it as many as were ordained believe you don't talk anybody into believing they believe or they don't believe why because the ordination of God this predestination listen my brother my sister you can be covered with all kinds of clouds of Darkness you could have everything to try to hinder you from getting to see what you're supposed to see but with the light penetrates that Darkness Hallelujah when the light penetrates that Darkness it quickens that seed to life can you say Amen to that it's not you doing it you were ordained to life and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed it's what believers do we believe it's just too simple oh tell me something I need to do yeah oh give me something I there's something I've got to achieve tell me what to do to inherit eternal life just believe no no no no no you didn't hear me give me something just believe I believe already just give me something oh maybe Lee wait wait wait you mean I've got something inside of me already that's answering back that says I believe I want to ask you what is that what is that you you don't understand it you didn't know who you were you didn't know if he's one God or three gods you didn't know anything but God rich and mercy ordained predestinated you so that when the light Shone across your path guess what it does it causes you huh that's me mama I love that song the sermon perfection oh God requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty him he's looking tonight no matter how much you've sinned how much or how how little or how much you're still a sinner you cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever why in him you're perfected forever think of it that's nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to perfection then you are perfected in Jesus Christ wait a second what part do I have to play in this you don't have a part it's him it's him doing it it's his calling it's his providing the way it's all about the seed listen this outer shell that we call you is not really you it's only what we see this it's the Earthly it's the Jacob you it's the little shyster the liar the guy that does brother deals to everybody else right that wasn't really him but God was looking Beyond and he saw the Israel he saw a prince with God do you understand God's not looking at you you he's looking at the god you he's not looking at the you you he's looking at the god you Lord have you ever had somebody waving hey hey how you doing and you wave back and they keep waving and then you realize they're waving to somebody behind you yeah hey yeah yeah act like you know him hey yeah how you doing brother you see what God is doing is he's trying to get your attention and he does it through the word that's the Christ anointing it is the third poll now watch this because there's got to be a way for God to bring you into a place of perfection now that third pull you all know brother Ram said it all has to do with the word being spoken it's a spoken shh be real reverent this is what I've told you we have long deceived for all these years it hasn't wasn't in the first and second poll it wasn't in all the healings and the discernments those those are good but he says let me tell you there's something far greater that's going on right now and this is what I've got to be reverent to it means a lot of breaking down a lot of becoming more sincere than what I've ever become amen what about you and I it takes a greater sincerity than what we've had oh God if there's anything we need it's a double dose of sincerity right now your perfection's coming in Christ that's why God has given this ministry of perfection to the church now understand it's not a man it's not the fivefold ministry it is the ministry of Christ that is the anointing because without the anointing you can have the message and never understand it you can have the Bible and never understand the god of the Bible but when God opens up the eyes of your understanding and then you see it your Bible becomes a new Bible the message becomes a whole new message it's not Creeds and dogmas it's not a long skirt in long hair those are traditions we do that because God is revealed to us what his will is and so therefore we give it back to him and then God says that's righteousness Luke 13 verse 31 and 32 same day there came a certain of the Pharisees saying unto him get thee out and the depart thanks for Herod will kill thee and he said to them go and tell that fox behold I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I shall be perfected you see brother Brown said watch your numbers three's perfection the first and second pull was only an attraction that never perfected nobody tell them who they are where they come from have all kinds of Visions yes yes yes that's me that only was an attraction we know that thou art a man come from God because no man could do these things except that God be with him but he said now listen very carefully he said there it is not the sign that is the attraction it's the voice behind the sign the voice of the sign you understand because saints of God if we're on our way to a destination and there is a sign Phoenix 35 miles as much as we enjoy the sign and the sign says Phoenix is 35 miles look Sandy wow we're almost there 35 miles and get out and run around the sign oh great sign we love you hey as much as I'm thankful for the sign somebody say let's keep going because the sign is not the destination the sign only tells me where I'm going I now understand this now I'm going to go into some deeper water here right now so I trust you can swim if you can't put on a little light vest and just tread water and try to keep up the change of ministry was a Perfection of ministry the change of ministry was a Perfection Ministry he is now cutting off those that don't have a part of a Perfection Ministry why the Shucks not air with the wheat the third poll is a separating pull the first two poles attracted everyone third pull is a separating pull except you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part with me what is he doing he's separating so what God is doing in a third pole Ministry is he is separating that's why my brother my sister God is now separating those that are not going to have a portion of the quickening ministry under the third pull so I want to explore this thought for a short time this morning of perfection pertaining to the third pool now watch this here in the sermon perfect faith see the sermon title perfect faith 1963 this is coming into that third pull I'm believing it then he talks about a sincere questionnaire thing this is just starting to bloom now see just started with I I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see so kind of raise faith faith into a bracket where you've never noticed it in that way before not a faith but a perfect faith build it up here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than any two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to perfection because the people has got to come to this in order for rapture it's a prerequisite are you are you with me now you either go to school you have prerequisites you want to get a a degree you have prerequisites you have certain classes you've got to take in order to go to the next class and to the next class so we have something that we've got to attain to before we go to Rapture what is it Perfection it's a Ministry watch this that's what's holding it away right now it's waiting for that church to come into perfect raptured faith looking for it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God Touch Somebody next to you and say you'll make it yeah yeah that's it yeah you'll make it Why by the grace of God it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saying it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saved you see it's not us it's him it's all him start to finish before the beginning after the end it's all him you're just along for the right like your kids in a car Are We There Yet dead you'll know when I stop Are We There Yet dead you'll know you'll know amen third poll is the revealing of the word so brother Ram said the spirit of the Lord is now moving upon the bride now watch this moving upon the bride by divine inspiration she's being moved into position by revelation Now understand you couldn't do that with the prophet still here because as long as he's here we use him as our spiritual sounding board he'll get it for me he'll tell me I'll just go to church and hey guess what Pastor go ahead and tell me and I don't have to do anything and so he sweats and labors and everything so now God takes him off of the scene and we go well what do we do now God changing the ministry understand this now when you see a change of ministry understand there's a change of administration and when you see Jesus change his ministry there's coming an Administration underneath him but the ministry continues but just in another form it's God in morpha he went from a one-membered body to a many membered body and brother Ram said that is called the mystical body of Jesus Christ of which all of you are a part of if you're in Christ now the bride is being moved into position and placing by the holy spirit because the holy spirit is the divine revealer of God's word you're being moved into position every woman in the scripture that God took notice of was moved into position by revelation Ruth moved into position to lay at boaz's feet at the threshing floor it was revealed to her Esther moved into position to go before the king and if I perish I perish but I must see the king Rahab placed the token out her window after hiding The Messengers do you see Mary said how can these things be seeing that I know not a man said not many days hence and what the holy spirit will overshadow you I want you to understand that the overshadowing that God has used from Genesis to Revelation is the Christ of God Peter who do they say that I the son of man am some say thou art Jeremiah one of the prophets raised up return Ministry but Peter who do you say that I am now in a couple of the Scriptures it says the Christ the son of the Living God but in one particular scripture he says Thou Art the Christ of God because this same Jesus whom you have crucified God hath made him both Lord and Christ he is the anointed that's why they called him Jesus the Christ he is the Christ of God I want all of you to understand the Christ of God is the anointed word made revealed to you personally that's why this message is not Church order that's a part of it it's not how to dress it's not how to pay your tithes it's not how to go to church the message is Christ brother random said he is those seals he is this message you think I got anything to do with it I have nothing to do with it I'm just a voice he's using and you remember that one quote this is no longer the voice of William Brown when the bride begins to catch the true revelation of who she is and by God's spirit discern and withstand the two spirits working within the framework of the church it's not going to be a Catholic Spirit a Lutheran Spirit a presbyterian Spirit a denominational spirit no it's going to be a spirit so close that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect brother Ram said I'm going to give a word to the church any of you ever read that he said now do you think that God's going to let you stay as one big happy family he said no you know what he's going to do he's going to wreak all kinds of Havoc he if he can't get among you he will anoint someone and place them there among you to shoot all kinds of poison and Discord that's why listen be careful who and what you say about anybody do you like to be somebody's trash can oh hey let me tell you don't tell anybody this but you know that uh you know uh look don't don't don't don't share this with nobody else I'm just telling you it's between you and I you know what that really means Go Tell It on the Mountain there's one person that I have told everything and he knows the very darkest deepest secrets of my life and he has never told nobody that's Jesus himself he's the only one I can confide in oh yeah you can confide in certain ones the next thing you know well I'll tell you what he told me this he told me that God help us amen now each one of them from Jeremiah to King David from all of the players within the Bible that we could take and we could go and we could go through every chapter in the Bible and we could see the ones that Christ follow me now that Christ was anointing them to play their part we could go through numbers we could go into Deuteronomy we could go into the book of First Samuel go to First Kings we could go into and go on Chronicles on on on Psalms Proverbs Isaiah Jeremiah Daniel Amos Zachariah Zephaniah it doesn't matter every one of them were playing a part that the anointing of God was causing them to know their position and pleasing that's why the prophet of God said it is so very important to know who you are and what part you play that's why that day when Christ entered his ministry I want to ask you he was a young boy that he confounded the Pharisees in the time of the temple is that right he'd been lost for three days parents can't find him when they do find him he's in the temple disputing they said don't you know your father and I have been looking for you for three days now the word corrects them and says I'm about my father's business Joseph's not my mama about my father's business are you listening to me Now understand this when did the ministry of Jesus Christ start when he enters into the synagogue as it was his custom and he asked for the scroll of Isaiah and he took the scroll and he opened it up and he found where it was written you haven't anointed me to preach Glad Tidings to the poor you have caused me and it goes on and he writes he reads the place now the prophet of God said he knew exactly what Ministry he was to be under because God was revealing it to him but he had to find it in the Bible so therefore he found where it was written and let me paraphrase it he found where it was written of him this day is this scripture fulfilled that's when his ministry started he took the book gave it back sat down and they all scratch her head huh whoa that's heavy man I know this guy's parents how can he say all these wow wow and like so many people within the message God Has His prophets say something so profound and we sit there and go wow That's Heavy yeah it is it's strong meat it belongs to those who are of full age not little babies who are still on the sincere milk of the word huh nah well I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos ah the Apostle Paul got so sick of them I'm so sick of you guys one says I'm a Paul are you not yet babes I like that he said you're still babes he didn't put him out he didn't call him serpent seed he didn't he didn't reject him he said you're still babes having the sincere milk of the word talking about the goodness of God laying on of hands and everything he said but God has given us a Ministry that is far greater let's go beyond laying on of hands let's go beyond the doctrine of Christ let's go on unto perfection brother Ram said hear ye him Phoenix placing of a son take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before angels Place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority because when you come to your place it gives you power for authority if you're not in your place no Authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that the very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there'll be a power put into the church and is now coming in that the holy spirit will soonoint the people till they'll speak to word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers like likes coming into the church now I know it for a fact say to this mountain don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be stopped it'll be a short time brother rum talks about short quick work of the Bride he said watch what you've seen temporarily will manifest before this thing is over in the fullness of its power second Timothy 3 16 says for all scriptures given by the inspiration of God as profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction in righteousness all scripture is given by the inspiration of God second Samuel 23 verse 2 the spirit of the Lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue prophets are mouthpieces what comes out of the prophet's mouth is a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God that spiritual anointing the spirit was giving an utterance and the spirit was making an announcement see the spirit of the Lord speak by me and his word was in my mouth second Peter 1 verses 20 and 21 knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost now watch the Holy Ghost is the anointing are we together on that that is the Christ of God that is the anointing and he and he alone then is the Divine revealer of the word so when the spirit of God moves Upon A man the man is the channel that God uses to bring an announcement or thus saith the Lord it's not the man speaking but God speaking through that vessel you know in the Bible the word of the Lord is used 234 times and the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah or one of the prophets and the word of the Lord came I want you to understand that the word of the Lord that actually when you go and look at it in the correct Hebrew form and the word of the Lord it actually is translated in Hebrew and the word of the Lord became Jeremiah the word of the Lord became Ezekiel in other words when the word of the Lord comes what does it do it connects you to deity when you catch Revelation from God and the word of the Lord enlightening you giving you understanding you know what you're doing the word of the Lord is becoming what does that make you what kind of a person are you that God would reveal something to you that he would share with you his mind what kind of a person are you that God would give you his thoughts I'll tell you what kind of person you are you're a God person because is it not written in your Bible that to he whom the word of the Lord comes to are ye not gods then why do you crucify me when I say because it is written he are gods now I tell you what US older men when we have our breakfast on Monday morning it used to be the golden boys because we met at the Golden Corral so that's what they call this The Golden Boys then they closed that down so we had to go somewhere else and pretty soon you know it was the old-timer's table and you know we had all kinds of names for it but ever since I preached on ye our Gods here several months ago you know what the what the name of the the group that gathers on Monday morning for breakfast what is it Scotty table of the Gods and we have some heavy discussions man I'll tell you what when brother Paul love all started yes yes oh the wrong let me tell you yes you ever seen him get excited he's always that way hey I was reading the other day and man I'll tell you what I couldn't hardly I mean Hey listen I'd rather sit across from Brother Paul than next to him when I'm eating because of Boom I'll tell you what yeah look at you this is what God saw me oh so good Flames come on I love it I love it I love to see somebody that enjoys ah I'd love to see somebody that says preach it to me preacher I love it give me somebody that says that's me give it to somebody that gets excited hey that's right that's right not just sitting there well you know yes that's good Hallelujah praise God yeah and Dave fallick too he's another one you get Dave when when Dave gets onto a deep subject uh brother Ron I just have one question oh yeah the theophany of God and then he just goes off and this you know long you know what's your question I don't have a question I'm just telling you the table of the Gods I want you to understand what does it make you my brother my sister that God in this end time would send unto you a prophet because he knew that the word he's preaching you would receive and you wouldn't understand it all in fact and many times it would be a quandary it would be something that you would question oh that's that that's hard Paul said many things that were hard to be understood is that right so this anointing is actually the word of God being made known to you we call it faith we call it revelation we call it the quickening power of God and for the first time that it's ever seen in the Bible is Genesis 15. the first time in the word of the Lord ever came to anyone Genesis 15. and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is Eliza of Damascus Lord you appeared to me you told me I'm going to have a son but I go childless and Abram said behold to me those given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir why has gone on in into Hagar according to the law he could do it behold the word of the Lord came into him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air correcting his idea of the way he thought God was going to do it many times God will allow you to go and go into something and and have a permissive will and God by his grace will come to you and he said this is not the way you thought it's not the way I was going to do it for you hang on why are you so quick on the trigger can't you wait they that wait upon the Lord while we get nervous we have to do something we have to produce something we have to manufacture so because you know what if if there's not something going on well something's wrong something's wrong somebody jumped somebody shouts somebody do something man yeah that's right there is a time to be still and know that I am God so this anointing that came upon him that's the grace of God Came Upon Abel Came Upon Seth Came Upon all the lineage of God all the way down and it was Christ that's why Brethren preaches those sermons The identified Christ of all ages who is it it's Christ it's that anointing it's no different today I can tell all of you today with an assurance in my heart I have found the Christ of God and it's called the message of the hour and it wasn't William Branham no he says I am a son of man revealing to you these in a man don't you dare worship Mary don't you baptize in my name don't you think I'm somebody I'm nobody I am but a voice crying out in this end time Wilderness huh don't you look to me why there'll be a spiritness in time that will anoint some to make them worship the messenger remember who Shadrach Meshach and Abednego refused to Bow their their need to it was an image to Daniel why he's the prophet of the Hour come on man everybody we should worship we should worship let's worship William Branham Let's uh come on everybody here let's be thankful I was in Cote d'Ivoire Ivory Coast having a meeting we have maybe 1500 2 000 believers and we had quite a meeting and and here's a sea of black faces when we come out of the meeting here's a whole other group of people there with a a picture that's probably half the size of that screen a picture of brother Brennan with a pillar of fire above his head and then they all got bunch of small photos of brother Branham and we come out of the meeting and they are chanting Branham is God Branham is God Branham is God Branham is God and they claim to believe the same message you do it is a fanatical element it is an antichrist Spirit brother random said to make me Jesus Christ is to make me Antichrist see we're not afraid to say that what is it he said there will be a spirit in the end time that will anoint some to believe that and actually when brother Branham first saw it he said it made me want to repent of my Ministry until God showed me that's the way they've done it before and he says and when I see it happening again now I understand okay all right now I'm going to try to bring this to a close wow yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I might have part three because listen when you eat so much you know the first time that you eat and you go to the smorgasbord and it's all you can eat your first plate yeah potatoes and the meat now I'm one of these my wife she likes to pick a little bit of this and a little bit of that I pass up all the nonsense I go right to the meat huh I get a few veggies and everything like that but I get this stuff yeah yeah come on get out of my way I do not like to be behind my wife because she oh a little bit of this and she takes that spoon and goes and and then she gets another spoon and I'm going come on I mean get a big spoonful the first time right so I bypass all of this I go right for the good stuff and no matter how good the first plate I'm one of these guys that listen I take the first bite wow oh my I hum when I eat when I like what I eat um it just something happened I do it even when preachers are preaching hmm I'd like yeah yeah give me some more of that hey pass it pass it down here don't stop come on keep you know but the first plate okay and but when you get a second plate it's the same stuff it just ain't as good you know what I'm talking about and then you go get a third plate because you're gluttonous and then you can't even eat it all and pretty soon you look at it oh man here waitress come take that thing if we're not careful that's what happens I feed you too much and yeah that's good oh yeah yeah and then we keep going and here's another quote Yeah musicians come I tell you I yeah yeah I realized come on musicians are I'm serious now come on yeah I realize you you're some of you are still doing this swallow oh I love him I'll tell you what my Damascus experience was my Damascus experience of God opening my eyes of understanding about what this message was all about was when my pastor Brother Floyd Patterson sent me overseas to open up a spoken word office the first time A Spoken Word office had been opened anywhere else in the world we opened one up there in Germany and there I surrounded myself with the tapes and books and it was a year and a half later into the spoken word office that Joseph Branham took over and the spoken word Incorporated itself huh spoken word Incorporated itself with the books and tapes because Bob and Camille do you remember when you had to get the tapes way back years ago you had to send to Fred softman in Tucson you want to get the reel to reel you remember the reel to reel yeah you had to send to Fred something you wanted to get a book you had to write to spoken word Roy borders so now Joseph Branham takes over the voice of excuse me spoken word and he inherits a work we're already doing it becomes the voice of God European office and for the first time because you know what I was like the vast majority of you I tried to listen to a tape when I had time but I was a contractor I was working I worked for brother Mike for years building houses he was the first one that put us to work up there in Flagstaff we're a bunch of Surfers and and guys the only thing we'd ever done was wax a surfboard we didn't know how to nail boards together and everything I never forget I come to work one time and we didn't like it when Mike showed up on the job because he was always looking huh he's not an easy guy to work for but he was the best teacher you know why he taught us ethics so we're on the job and I had forgot my tools imagine going to work and you forgot your hammer and your tape measure and your your pouches oh I was just I was late so I just jumped in my truck I forgot I took him out of my truck so I get to work and I'm up there and hey Mitch throw me your tape okay yeah okay here it is back and forth hey throw me your hammer okay so I'm up we're doing some work or something like that and I don't want to say in front of brother Mike but finally I have to hey Mitch throw me your tea he throws me his tape Mike walks over he was wearing his sunglasses and he would always push him up with his one finger he said Ron where's your tape I began to speak in tongues stammering lips I forgot them you you what you came on the job without your tools [Music] well I suggest you go home you take the rest of the day off and you go find your tools and tomorrow when you come back to work you bring your tools okay that's not fair yes it is fair my brother my sister when you come to church you bring your tools with you you should have your Bibles you should be prayed up you should be ready to hear the word of God huh amen yeah yeah amen so I have about five more pages so I've got a part three now let me tell you what happened the night before last I had a bunch of already notes that I told you okay I'm

of study and prayer and you you get it ready and you're there now if I can get somebody now I think in the upper left hand corner there is a thing that says auto save turn it on but does that save
