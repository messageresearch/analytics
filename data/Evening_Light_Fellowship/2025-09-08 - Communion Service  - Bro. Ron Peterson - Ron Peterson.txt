We want to magnify and glorify him. &gt;&gt; It's always such a precious time when we come together for communion and foot washing and we just want to invite him to come and have his way tonight. Before we go to the Lord in prayer, let's sing the little chorus. Peace like a river. Amen. And invite him to come and have his way. Peace like a river. [Music] Love like a mountain.

Fall fresh on us tonight. Amen. Brother Amos, would you come tonight to take us to the Lord in prayer? A praise report. I believe it's from brother Joel Mukabay. He said, "I would like to thank brother Ron and the Lord after brother Ron prayed for us on Sunday asking the Lord to grant us a work permit. It was granted last Thursday." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise the Lord. Pray the Lord just continue to be with him. Amen. Brother Sean, Sister Janet are on their way home. Praise the Lord. Please pray for traveling mercy. So let's remember the Garveys as they would travel. It' be good to have them back home again. And Amen. We want to continue to pray for Sister Janet Brander. She fell last night and hurt her knee and her wrist. Her body is very sore and she is at home resting tonight. Thank you Lord for watching over her. It could have been much worse. So let's pray for Sister Jan Brander. I pray the Lord continue to be with her. Amen. Brother Amos, if you would take us to the Lord in prayer. If you have a need tonight, if you just want to lift that up before the Lord in prayer. God bless you. Amen. The Lord's so mindful, huh? You know, I was just walking up here and I was looking at Jonathan. I go, man, I keep wanting to ask him, when are brother, brother Shawn and Sister Janet coming back? &gt;&gt; You know that when one of us is missing, you don't think you're missed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a miss. there's something missing. You know, part of the family's not there. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I pray that the Lord was with them this whole time. And I'm so thankful they're coming back. I look forward to seeing them. But let's go ahead and pray. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just come humbly before your throne, Lord, tonight. Lord, you said to your disciples one day, "Except you eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you have no part with me, Lord." And Lord, those words ring true today, Lord. That's why we're gathered here tonight, Lord. Because we're here to eat of your flesh and drink of your blood, Lord. Lord, we're so thankful for that blood, Lord. Because without blood, there's no remission of sins, Lord. And Lord, we we thank you for that blood. We It sanctifies us, Lord. Now, help us do like our pastor said this morning, and sanctify ourselves. Help us to take the scripture, the word, and apply it to our life, Lord. Help us to not look at others, Lord, but to look from within the enemy from within, Lord, that's trying to take us down, Lord. I pray that you would through the washing of the water of the word, Lord. May the bars of just things that hold us so easily, beset us, just be taken down, Lord, and smashed. And Lord, help us to wash your feet tonight, Lord. And for Jesus had dirty feet one day. And and just like the woman at the well, like our pastor said this morning, surely they would have said if you knew what she what kind of life she lives, you wouldn't let her draw water for you. But yet, Lord, you know all things. You search the reigns of the hearts, Lord. And we're gathered here tonight, Lord. Each one of us representing what you've done in our lives, Lord. And we're here to give back to you, Lord, according to everything that we can do. And now these needs, Lord, Sister Janet, Lord, uh, fell, Lord, and hurt herself, Father. These bodies are so feeble and weak, Lord. And we need you, Lord. I pray that you would come on the scene for her. Touch her, Lord, and lift her up, Lord, that she might. She's such a faithful soldier of the cross, Lord. I pray that you would be with her, Father. Restore unto us all things, Lord. Lord, we just love you. We We thank you for this time tonight. We pray that you would just be with us, Lord. May you be glorified in everything that we do and say. Be with those who couldn't be with us tonight, Lord. And be with those that are streaming, Lord. We just love you. We ask you these precious things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Amos. You may be seated tonight. I'm going to be looking forward to our communion, our footwashing service this evening. Amen. God is good. Amen. I was thinking of the song today. There's going to be a meeting in the air. The sweet, sweet by and by. You have heard of little Moses in the bull rush. And you have heard of fearless David and his slain. You have heard the story told of grieving Joseph and of Jonah and the whale you often sing. And there are many, many others in the Bible. I should like to meet them all. I do declare by and by the Lord will surely let us meet them at that meeting in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet and by. I am going to meet you, meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear, heard by mortal will be glorious, I do declare. And God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. Many things will there be missing at that meeting. For the mourers's bench will have no place at all. And there will never be a servant preached to sinners. For the sinner had refused to heed the call. And there will be no mourning over weward loved ones. There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer. All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted at that meeting in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet, sweet by and by. And I am going to meet you, meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear, never heard by mortal ear, will be glorious. I do declare and God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. There the doubters will be missing all together. All the skeptics will be absent on that day. There will be no rumblers present to disturb us. We'll be busy far away. There the saints will have his seal upon their foreheads. Dressed in Raymond, but ransom ones can wear. All who have that wedding garment will be present at that meeting in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by. And I am going to meet you, meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. Such singing you will hear. Never heard by mortal ear will be glorious. I do declare and God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air. [Music] Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his chosen people come and dine. And with his men a he and supplies our every day. Oh his sweetness up with Jesus all the time. Oh come and dine. The master call it come and dine. You make feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitude turns water into wine. To the hungry call it now. come and die. The disciples came the lamb. Thus obeying Christ to man for the master called to them, "Come and die." There they found their heart's desire. Bread and fish upon the fire. Thus he satisfies the hungry every time. Oh, come and dine, the master calling, "Come and die. For you may feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitude. Turn water into wine. To the hungry call it now. Come and die. Soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side. All the hosts of heaven will assemble big. Oh will be a glorious sight. All the saints in spotless white and with Jesus they will feast eternally. Oh come and dine the master calling come and die. You may feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitude turn the water into wine. To the hungry call it now. Come and sing the chorus again. Oh, come and die. The master callth, come and die.

[Music] Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you. Let's just remain standing. Thank you musicians each and everyone. It's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Here we are on communion and footwashing. It is a very important time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I give you these three ordinances for you to do, not three suggestions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Three ordinances that you keep until I come. &gt;&gt; So it's important because what you do is you come here and you judge yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it's very important um to come and partake of communion and footwashing. &gt;&gt; Amen. First Thessalonians 5 vers 18 through 24. Amen. Uh, brother Mark, I think I've asked you if you would First Thessalonians 5 verse 18- 24. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. Now notice verse 23, very important. &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this evening in God's presence. Praise the Lord. So glad to see you all out here to our communion and service uh this evening. Now, uh did some of you get these uh little graphs? And I I think uh Steve McNeely told me said Martin Malumba went and he just went over and took a picture of each one of them. I thought, why didn't I think of that? Why in the world he have to, you know? But anyway, uh that way you can keep it. you can print it out and you can give it to somebody else and and everything. Um, and so we'll just be touching a little bit more uh this evening on this uh and we're going in the direction of uh that uh may God sanctify you holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not hol y but w h o l l y. In other words, in totality. I want to both your body, your spirit and your soul. Now when you understand the message and you begin to see the unfolding of the word even to the prophet of God uh throughout his life as a young Baptist minister, one of the first times that he goes to a Pentecostal meeting in I think it was in Mishawaka and he was there and boy he saw things that he had never seen before. people all excited and they were jumping and shouting. They were speaking in tongues and interpretations of tongues and my he just saw things that he had never seen before. He says there I I uh I said, "Wow." One of the guys says, "Have you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost?" He said, "Well, I ain't got what you got." And uh he you know so anyway as you all know in brother Brandham's life story he said there I uh now you all know he has a supernatural gift in his hand &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; he said when I shake somebody's hand that I would know I would just be able to discern and um so um in fact brother Billy Paul told me that he said uh Billy brother Brennham had told him he said Billy I wish I didn't have this gift, &gt;&gt; not in my hand. He said, "It's so hard for me because people tell you with their face and with their lips, "Oh, we love you, Brother Brennham. Oh, we enjoy your ministry." And he said, "I shake their hand and I know they don't." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be tough for you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he said, "I kind of wish I didn't know those things." And yet God supernaturally allowed him to have that gift. So he's there moving in the spirit and there's one man stands up and he speaks in tongues and another one uh he interprets it and boy he says, "Oh, I must be among angels." He said, "This is amazing. I just am excited." You know, and he says, "I just couldn't wait to go." And he said, "I mingled around until I met the man that got up and spoke in tongues." And and um he said, "Uh my he was just true blue. He was just as pure a Christian, loved the Lord." He said uh and he says, "Then I made my way around and I met the man who interpreted." And he said, I shook his hand. He said, "What a hypocrite." He said, "This man uh uh you know was had a blond-haired wife and or black dark-haired wife and had children by a blondhaired woman and so on and so forth." And now Brother Brennan is very confused. Brother Brenham is asking God, "God, I don't understand this. This is I thought I was among angels. No, what is this? Am I among devils? what is the situation going on? So, brother Brennham, as you know, as a being a man of God, what he does is he goes and he prays. He gets alone and Elijah his prayer closet was always to get out, get alone, and he was out in the cave uh as you know, and he's seeking the mind of the Lord concerning this situation and everything because now this has troubled him. How is it that this genuine Holy Spirit and I felt it and I bore witness of it that the genuine Holy Spirit was falling on these people and yet one is a hypocrite and another one is a true blue Christian. And so uh he says I was out there and I had been studying in my Bible. I had my Bible laying across the log and I come out and and he says and and uh I was just kind of meditating and the wind blew the pages. He said, "But that's not where I was studying." He brings it back and the wind blows it again. And he and now now watch a man of God. He said, "I know that's for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Even the blowing of the pages of my Bible," he said, 'Lord, are you trying to show me something? In the rain that falls off upon both the just and the unjust, does not the cockab raise up with the weed? And both of them praise God. And so now, Brother Brennham is beginning to understand the anointed ones at the end time &gt;&gt; now. Now, when brother Brandon preaches and he talks about the false anointed ones at the end time, as a young Christian, I thought it was false anointing on even wrong seed. And when you listen to the sermon, no, it's a genuine Holy Spirit falling upon both seed and nonse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a little bit hard for us to understand because, you know, if I were God, I would have it just cut and dried. It's just falls on. You know what I'm saying? And but you know what? God who is very gracious. &gt;&gt; He would that all men &gt;&gt; come to repentance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His blessings fall upon the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; And how that he pours out his blessings upon all. And so uh he then begins to actually understand you can be anointed with the Holy Ghost. Listen to this because this is his teaching. And there's many quotes on this and I'm not here to show you all those quotes tonight. He said you can have the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day and your soul on its way to hell. He says because it's only upon either your body or your spirit. It hasn't come to the control tower. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hasn't come in and taken place where God is Lord of your life. Jesus said, "Many will say unto me in that day,"Lord, Lord, have we not prophesy? &gt;&gt; Have not we cast out devils, done one uh wonderful works in thy name?" And Jesus will say unto them, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never knew you." The word know is genosis which means I never conceived you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can do all of these works. You can prophesy. You can understand all the mysteries. You can give your body to be burned. You can do all even as we see in first Corinthians there and have not love because God is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do all these things and you can be activated. You can have the Holy Spirit activating gifts of the spirit and yet the control room is still God is not sitting on the throne. So that's uh a very very important thing to understand because when you see even in this end time message ministers and they preach and sometimes there's great anointings, great emotions, great sensations and screamings and and shout and I'm not against that at all. I I I believe in getting excited. I believe in being quickened. But sometimes, brother Brennham says, "I'm afraid what we do is we get one another's spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He says, "Watch." He said, "If the pastor is kind of fanatical and he bo, excuse me, he bobs his head in a certain way," he said, "they'll do the same thing." &gt;&gt; He said, "If another is starchy and he just get gets up there and and he just teaches and it's cut and dried and there's no amen, no nothing." and he said that the and and he's quite dry himself. The congregation will be that way. Now, I don't want any of you to be either too emotional or not emotional at all. &gt;&gt; I want all of us to be right in the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I pray that uh you will have a balanced walk in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, now, uh, brother Mark, and I think I gave it to the brethren here. We'll go to the book of Romans, chapter 1, vers 16 through 32. But while they're turning, some of you have got this this graph. Do do you got that? And in that graph, I don't know if they can even show it. Can you show it up here for just a second? All right. Soon as they'll get it, you'll let me know when it's up there. Some of you point. Is it up there? Ronnie, let me know. Good. Thank you, Ronnie. Okay. I want you to see that the the natural man, he's worldly, he's fleshy. He's the old man. He has five senses. But notice that he is carnally minded. Now, carnally minded is emnity with God. neither knows the things of God. That's why until you're born again, you don't understand the things of God. So Jesus told Nicodemus, except a man be born again of the spirit because that which is flesh, it's flesh, &gt;&gt; but that which is spirit is spirit. And understand that Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, they're different than just you and I speaking. His words are spirit and life. And so, you hearing the word of God, hearing God's eternal word, it is Zoey, God's own life, &gt;&gt; comes through the hearing gate &gt;&gt; into the womb of your mind. Okay? And there's where either you accept or reject the word of God and you stop the word from going beyond your mind. I don't believe it. I doubt it. I don't believe that at all. Well, guess what? The word of God, the germ of life, let's call it the sperm of God is stopped right there. The spermicide of unbelief kills the seed. &gt;&gt; Not the seed, the germ of life. But when you open your mind and accept through your sp and and I'll show you the quote where brother Bram said you you have a spiritual womb and you have a physical womb and when the germ of life god's own words come beyond your carnal mind and it is not stopped by unbelief Right? &gt;&gt; And now it comes through, okay? It comes through that part, through your spirit, the womb of your spirit, and the seed then keeps going. It's like a woman when she gets pregnant, there's all kinds of spermatzoa. Your biology class tells you that. thousands of sperm from the male because the female has the egg. &gt;&gt; But she in a union with love when that seed germ of life is passed into the woman, there is one little germ of life that fights its way past all the rest to get to that egg. And there is a special thing that happens and I taught this before and the rest of you probably weren't here but that spermatzoa that germ of life then it connects to that seed and as soon as it does and medical science has proven this that once it touches that egg it begins to now bore itself until it penetrates the egg. And when it does, there is a the egg now closes itself off because it's now germatized. No other spermatizoa can get in there. &gt;&gt; And whatever seed &gt;&gt; was there that is germatized will bring forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Genesis 1:11 that every seed that is within itself will bring forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see here when a man is born again he no longer has a carnal mind but now he has a spiritual mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he gets the Holy Ghost and God comes in he now has the very mind &gt;&gt; of God himself. the very mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Carnally minded, spiritually minded, and then we have the very mind of Christ. Okay, let's let's go on. And I'm going to have you, brother Mark, if you would. What did I tell you? We're going to Romans 1 starting at verse 16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God unto salvation, to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith. Look at this. The righteousness of God revealed from faith unto It's a continuing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an unfolding &gt;&gt; from faith to faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. Go ahead. As it is written, the just shall live by faith. But the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; who hold the truth in unrighteousness. The very wrath of God is now being revealed. Okay? &gt;&gt; Because that which may be known of God is manifest. For God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead. So that they are without excuse. &gt;&gt; They are without excuse from the infinite to the finite. &gt;&gt; The scientists and the doctors and everybody says, "We see God's fingerprints on everything." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are without excuse. They realize, wow, this just didn't happen by a bang. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there is an eternal plan in all of this. &gt;&gt; And they can't explain it. So now watch as we see that they are without excuse. Go ahead, brother Mark. Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations. And their foolish heart was darkened. &gt;&gt; So they knew God. They saw God in nature. They were seeing gods manifesting himself. Okay? &gt;&gt; Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and for-footed beasts and creeping things. &gt;&gt; See, he's got to put God in a box. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I I guess God is um he's the son, so we'll worship the sun. Or he's a for-footed animal. He's a a lion. We'll worship the lion. He's changing the invisible God into a visible carnal image. Go ahead, brother Mark. &gt;&gt; Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves. &gt;&gt; So he gave them up to what? Uncleaness. &gt;&gt; Fornicating spirits, seducing spirits, enticing spirits, Jezebel spirits. religious spirits, &gt;&gt; okay? Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; For this God, &gt;&gt; watch this. &gt;&gt; For this cause. &gt;&gt; For this cause. What cause? For this cause. They they they they changed the truth of God. &gt;&gt; They perverted it. Made it a lie. &gt;&gt; It was done by a big bang. And and man was evolved. Charles Darwin says, "We come from an ape and after all these years and you see homo sapien finally comes up and now he's upright man." And for this cause, go ahead. &gt;&gt; For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature. &gt;&gt; So watch this. &gt;&gt; And likewise also the men hold on Mark. Man, you are such a good reader. Such a good reader. He's got Hey, Mark has got that FM midnight radio voice, doesn't he not? It's just that soothing Hello Saints. This is Mark Stany coming at the midnight hour. I'll be too with you till 6:00 a.m. Anyway, that doesn't matter. But you got such a good voice. But for this God uh cause God gave up to vile unclean affections and the women. Watch it first manifest in the weaker vessel. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That which is against nature. Verse 27. And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another. men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meek. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient. &gt;&gt; Watch this now. They didn't like to retain God in their knowledge. In other words, hey, I don't believe that uh you know these things that it just happened. did. So now for this cause God see there's cause and effect. So what God did is he says okay you think you're so wise you become foolish. &gt;&gt; Look at the wisdom of this world. Is it not foolishness with God? &gt;&gt; For isn't the preaching the co the cross to them that perish &gt;&gt; foolishness? &gt;&gt; But unto us which are saved it is what? The power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he gave him over to a rep probate mind. Go ahead. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things. &gt;&gt; Inventors of evil things, disobedient. Wow. This this takes now all of you kids disobedient to parents. &gt;&gt; Do you know that it says he who curses his mother and father should be stoned and put to death? We wouldn't have so many kids here in the assembly if it happened to you. be now you know look I I I it's not a funny thing &gt;&gt; the Bible says honor your father and mother &gt;&gt; give respect unto them okay so dis look at this idoltors and these guys and haters of God and he says and disobedient to parents okay without understanding covenant breakers without natural affections implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. &gt;&gt; They not only know it's wrong, &gt;&gt; but they have pleasure in doing it. Look at the world. That's what they're doing. &gt;&gt; They're mega dosing &gt;&gt; on sin &gt;&gt; and they'll laugh in your face. one of my friends who just as I came to the Lord um uh anyway I remember witnessing to him his name was Jud. I said, Jud, I said, I gave my heart to the Lord and everything like ah you guys in this Christianity, I'll take my choice. You know what? It's just a figment of man's a nation imagination. I'll take my chances. I said, this one, you're going to lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the road is God. &gt;&gt; And he said, well, I'm going to take my chances. So there are those that have been turned over to reprobate minds. &gt;&gt; Understand? You see, if you're not going to get the mind of Christ, &gt;&gt; you'll take the mind of somebody else. &gt;&gt; Who you are of your father, the devil, and his mind, his works, his thoughts, you'll do. You'll be murderers, deceitful, haters of God, despisers of those that aren't good. All of those things. Look at that. And they will be disobedient to parents. Okay. Now, uh I want to show you because we're talking about uh there is a spiritual womb and a physical womb. So, Brother Brennham picks this up in a sermon where brother Brennham, now I of all the years of my believing the message, and I've been studying this sermon, the spoken word is the original seed. It's one of the longest sermons. But brother Brennham, my wife and I were there in the bedroom and we're listening and brother Brenham says, "Now I know uh that my doctrine and some of my teaching has really caused some people to misunderstand me." And he says, "So what I want to do, I want to lay it out very perfectly and clear so I will not be misunderstood." And he says, and he goes on into the spoken word is the original seed. Now on paragraph 178, let he says, let's go back now and pick up again and come down for something. You remember last Sunday, Sunday's service was the gate to the soul. You remember now there is a womb of the physical and there is a womb for the spirit. Did you do you believe that there is a spiritual womb and there is a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit? Your mind. Where is the greatest battle ever fought? Mind &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; So now God chose the heart and Satan chose the mind. Because Satan wants to throw all of his anointing, his science, all of his knowledge. He wants to throw it at you and he wants to bombard your mind and said that can't be all of this. Ah, I tell you, you that believe in God, there is no God. That's a figment. Man made him up. And so you you you see this these there's a physical womb and a spiritual womb. So the greatest battle that you're going to fight all of you are is in your mind. And Satan will use these entrances or the gateways to your spirit to try to anoint you with his unbelief. Because God's got the anointing which brings faith and Satan's got an anointing which brings unbelief. &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, brother Brennham even said an elect seed can go many years before he recognizes who he is &gt;&gt; because you're hardheaded, hard-hearted. &gt;&gt; Okay? But guess what? God gets his man. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how hard you are and &gt;&gt; all the things that you go through. It took a while and you went had to go out and do your thing and next thing you know God gets a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Got a friend of mine from South Africa. He said, "You know where God got a hold of me? On the dance floor." &gt;&gt; And he told me, "What are you doing here?" &gt;&gt; On a dance floor of all places. And he said, "I stopped right in the middle of the dance and everything's going on like this." And he said, "What am I doing here?" Now let's the mind is the womb of the spirit. Let's continue on. Why? Now remember I told you last Sunday draw it out here for you. These five senses that enters this seed from the outside. Okay? See, taste, feel, smell, hear five on the inside. conscience and so forth from the inside f on the life side. That's the inside. There's only one that's you're on the basis of free moral agency to accept to take in or let out there. Look, there's either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; That's right. So you can hear the word comes through the hearing of the ear, the heargate comes through the mind. But if right there in your heart, I don't believe it, stops it right there. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh so gives you free moral agency. You have the right to choose. And yet um you let me let me say this and clarify this. It may be a little bit hard to understand. You say you chose him. No, he chose you first. &gt;&gt; No man can come to the father except my father draw him &gt;&gt; first. &gt;&gt; So no matter how well I can go to church. Yeah, you can. Yeah, I can do what you do. I can wear a dress. I can do those things. I can do the legality of the word of God. I can keep the commandments and still not have life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That doesn't give you life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And you can be religious. See, the deceitfulness of religion, it's a false covering. &gt;&gt; Religion is a covering. The first thing that Adam and Eve did to cover their nakedness was to make a religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hide their nakedness. And they ran from God. &gt;&gt; And the there's many people that run from really serving God. So they have a fig leaf covering, a religion that covers their conscience. &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church on Sunday. I give unto the church my money. I do this that. Yeah. He doesn't deny all that. And they satisfy a religious &gt;&gt; obligation &gt;&gt; guilt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church. &gt;&gt; I give them my tithes. The rich young ruler &gt;&gt; from my birth. I have done all these things, but thou lackest one thing. See, religious people uh want to only satisfy their religious tastes, but they don't want to give themselves totally 100% to the Lord. &gt;&gt; They honor God with their lips, &gt;&gt; but their hearts are far from him. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, we see the three. Let let's go ahead and go back to that three-fold nature the graph there and and no go to the I'm sorry the other one that that yeah that one there. Okay. So we see the man is a body spirit soul. Okay. Now you can have the Holy Spirit on the outside of your body on the flesh man and you go to church. Oh, I feel good. Oh, warm fuzzy. Isn't that good? God, you're so good. Okay. The rain falls on the just and the unjust. So, the outer court has got nothing to do with the spirit within you. You're just feeling, oh, I just, oh, I just feel good. Oh, it's And so people go and they go to church to feel good, &gt;&gt; to have a religious satisfying. That's why brother Brennham says in the sermon, a thinking man's filter, he says uh he says they will choose a religion or a church that satisfies their worldly taste. &gt;&gt; Well, I can I I remember going to my wife's family reunion. They were Catholic, very strict Catholic. Their priest was there with them and he's drunk. He's telling dirty jokes. He he is there with them and uh everything. And one of her family came up and said, "See, our priest comes here and he just does these things." And you guys, what makes you think you're so holy? What makes you think we're you're better than we are? Look at our priest. He's coming here. He's the You see? And so they satisfy this religion by, well, I can I can still smoke, drink, cuss, I can tell dirty jokes. I can go to dances. I can go to movies. I everything because it really doesn't condemn me. Brother Brennham said that they have no conscience. &gt;&gt; He says, "Why? You got no more conscience than the snakes's got hips." He he said you could wear a 10gallon hat. You're so low down. You could wear a 10gon hat and slide under the belly of a snake and your hat never touched the belly of the snake. That's pretty low down. So understand now, brother Brennham is giving us an understanding that you can have this uh anointing on the outside. The rain falls on according to Hebrews 6:7 on the just and the unjust. It's the carnal man. He doesn't change. He doesn't need to change. But then we see the spirit of man. Um, and the Holy Spirit anoints gifts of the spirit. Now, I gave you this one also. Can you change to this one, Matthew? Okay, go ahead and change to this one because we talked about the gifts that are in the body. Now, remember all the gifts that are in the body. And now, how many know that gifts and callings are without repentance? &gt;&gt; If you've got the gift of tongues, if you've got the gift of prophecy, if you've got these gifts, they were there when you were born. &gt;&gt; But they come to fruition when you come to the knowledge and you and God begins to anoint you and you see and God anoints you. What is it? You were born with the gifts. I remember uh one of the brothers who was a a minister. He said, "I used my gift of discernment. I had discernment as a young man and he said, "I worked in a bar. Men would come up to the bar, sit down, and before they ordered, I mixed their drink and set it in front of them." And he said, they said, "Well, how did you?" He said, "I just know. Let's have this gift." gifts and callings are without repentance. Now understand here that you have the according to Romans 12 4-9 you have the gift of exhorting. You can be a good exhorter and not even be called of God. You can be a good eloquent speaker. Paul said I don't come to you here with enticing words of man's wisdom. I'm I come to you here in weakness and in trembling. You can have the gift of teaching, prophecy, ministry, ruling, giving, mercy, governments, and helps. That that gift of helps. Every pastor loves to have somebody in the church that has just the gift of helps. You need help. &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. Thank you. Gift of helps. And we aren't going to go all, but these are gifts on the spirit realm. Now then in 1 Corinthians 12 8-10 we see here you have these gifts of the spirit but they are anointing your spirit. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Holy spirit upon your spirit. And you can you can discern spirits. You can have interpretations of tongues. You can have knowledge. You can prophesy. Did not Caiaphas prophesy? &gt;&gt; I mean, we could go through scriptural examples. Have the gift of wisdom. Paul said, "You might have faith to move mountains and have not love." You're just a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Healing, miracles, and tongues. That's why somebody says, "I'm not going to believe anything of your ministry until I see miracles and signs and wonders." Well, that's what they're looking for. And let me tell you out there among denomination or all kinds of healings and miracles and stuff. I'm not looking to signs. I look to the word. &gt;&gt; Signs follow the believer. I could tell you time after time and and and tell you of the times when I come back, whether it's these ministers that go overseas, whether it's brother Mario or whatever, and you go and minister and God answers the people's needs and the gift was anointed of God. You spoke and they said, "How did you know?" &gt;&gt; It was a God anointing the gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are all kinds of excuse me, but I will say supernatural gifts and signs that even follow my ministry, but I don't come back here and tell you all. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't put it in a magazine. Well, I'll tell you what. On December the 5th over here on this in 1988 and I was praying for somebody and this and God showed me and I saw the pillar of fire, all this stuff. Well, next thing you know, it's all these things. And hey, hey, listen. I don't put that in the forefront. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just believe that God does it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make myself something big. &gt;&gt; I always point to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "You think I'm the one that does these things?" &gt;&gt; Watch the humility. I'm not him. I just happen to be the vessel that God uses. &gt;&gt; Okay? Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. That is one of the key factors that drew me to this message &gt;&gt; was the humility of this prophet. &gt;&gt; Never did he point to himself. &gt;&gt; He could have taken this gift. I think one of the men come up wanted to give him what is it over a million bucks, one half million dollars or something like that. How many ministers within the message? Praise God. I'm going to put that in my faith magazine. Somebody gave me a million half dollars. Oh, praise God. They're blessing my ministry. Brother Bram said, "No, sir." He refused it. I think um how quickly some would say, "Who's going to be a faith? How many here will give a $100?" It would be somebody over here give 200. How many? It's like an auction. Stop it. &gt;&gt; When Oral Roberts said God was holding him hostage for several million dollars, I thought, are you kidding me? Oral Roberts tells his people, God is holding me hostage and he's going to take my life if you don't give millions of dollar. And so next thing you know, they're to and here's the telephone line. Call now. Call now. I don't want to die. Call now. And so all these people and and and guess what couple hours later got millions of dollars. I asked my board one time if I threw that out to you, what would it was nice knowing you, brother Ron. God bless you. It's just like &gt;&gt; see you. &gt;&gt; See, God doesn't do but the foolishness. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said religion has become big business. &gt;&gt; Okay. They fleece the people instead of feeding the people. They make you the servants of them instead of them serving you. &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; He was a servant unto all. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go on here. And I wasn't going to preach. In fact, my wife asked me if I was going to pre. I said, "No, I'm you know." And then I went to my office and they he says, "Are you going to church tonight?" Yeah. Yeah. My 15 words per minute was just blazing on that. computer. So we've got three definite characteristics of body. It is the outward shell. It's seen. Brother Bram says, "Now you can see me, but you've never seen the real me." &gt;&gt; Because there is a life force inside of me &gt;&gt; that you've never seen. You see the shell. Now, when we get over there and we have our theophony body and glorified and the celestial and all this and it comes together and whatever and brother Brennan wondered when we get into heaven, will we know one another? He said, "Here's two clouds. Maybe I'm going to be a cloud. Another cloud passes by." And I asked, "Is that you, brother Neville?" Now understand if we are knowledgeable enough, okay, to be able to recognize somebody here and when we get over there and we know him even as he is known and we have such a greater understanding, do you think we'll know one another's name? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think we'll recognize one another? &gt;&gt; Uh, hold on. Hold on. Uh, &gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah. I I'm just Don't Don't Don't tell me. Don't tell me uh brother that won't happen over there. &gt;&gt; You will know immediately. It's right there. The older I get sometimes uh somebody's name I Jesus I chase it for minutes. It's frustrating. That won't happen over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you will have such a far greater understanding. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. So um this outward man is the one you brush his teeth, you comb his hair, you wash his face, you take care of the carnal man every day, but he's the one that really fights you the most. You know why? Because it's a byproduct of sin. &gt;&gt; Everyone for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. and the wages of sin is death. So you came into this, brother Mrennham said, you came into to this dimension, this earth hybrid, and because of your prostitute parents, Adam and Eve, he said, you came down here carnal. You bypassed your theophony, came down here, and so here you are. Bang, you just all of a sudden showed up. And I want all of you to understand, none of you are a mistake. Your parents might not have planned for you. You might have been that baby five years after they thought they were done. All a sudden, bing, you show up. &gt;&gt; It's still in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None of you are a mistake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God watched over your seed, over your great great ding ding ding down here like a pinball machine. All of a sudden, dang, here you come. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But you didn't know who you were. &gt;&gt; Why? God took it from your remembrance. &gt;&gt; You were carly minded. You were just going along in life thinking, "Ah, well, I guess I'll be a I'll be a surfer. I'll be a marine biologist. I'll, you know, I'm going to do this and that and everything." And and you're you're kind of going on your way. And then all of a sudden, God keeps his appointment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said, "Jesus keeps every appointment." Each one of you, I want you to know this that God chose you and gave you a time when he's going to reveal himself &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; And he says that's what a Christian is is when God comes to you and reveals himself to you personally. Y &gt;&gt; it's not of the God of your father and mother and the God of the prophet and the God of the Bible, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's all historical stuff. That's that's out here. But when God comes down and talks to you, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, Jacob never had that personal experience with God until he met him face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have all kinds of Bethl experiences. That's wonderful. Great. I see angels ascending, descending. Brother Billy Paul said, "I saw the angel He said, "Brother Ron, it never changed me." &gt;&gt; So you can see all of the supernatural. It doesn't change you. &gt;&gt; But when God has the appointed time, you can run, but you cannot hide. &gt;&gt; God is going to get you. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Laian uh church age, there are three things that are always going to be a problem with the flesh man. the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. Every one of you, you're born with that. So now watching church age, brother Rem says, "A quick look at the scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition." In Matthew 4, wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil, he overcome the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only. In each of these three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of Eden, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. Jesus overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Satan came to her and said, "It's written. Okay. &gt;&gt; She could have said it's also written. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But she didn't. She didn't use the word. &gt;&gt; Okay. And Eve fell. Now, what was the channel in her spirit realm that Satan used to anoint her? &gt;&gt; Reasoning. &gt;&gt; Took the mind. Don't you want to be like God? Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. Don't you want to know good from evil? Don't you want to be more like Yeah. Right. High five. That's what I want. And he and brother Bram said he stopped or he got her to stop long enough to listen to his reasoning &gt;&gt; and then he took her physically. Seducing her with words for years &gt;&gt; got her to stop long enough. And when she accepted his doubt of the word, &gt;&gt; Satan took her. &gt;&gt; Then he imparted his seed. &gt;&gt; It's a religious spirit. Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word. But Jesus overcame by the word. And right now, let me say this that the only way to be an overcomer also is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're going to overcome these temptations of the lust of the fa the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, it's going to only be the word. And God quickens that word. That word is your defense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you go from the body to the spirit, which is that unseen man, the the inside man that really none of us see. We have an outer shell that we put on the face and we go to church and we dress it up and we look okay, but inside you could be a ravening wool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not the outward appearance. Now it's the spirit because the spirit is controlled by the inside, &gt;&gt; the control room. You can look right, talk right, walk right, do all of these things, keep the commandments, and still be lost. Now, so you go from the body to the spirit and you can tell who is on the control tower by watching what the spirit of the man or the woman is feeding upon. Let me go into the house. Let me go into their room. Let me see what they feed their spirit on and I'll tell you who's sitting on the throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So the soul is the heart of man. It's the control tower. Now if we pardon me, excuse me, go to that three-fold nature there of man. And I haven't got it drawn in here, but when they you take in here, if you guys could just imagine, there's a little throne right here. I on one of my other graphs I I drew an actual throne and below the throne because what brother Brandham had done one time he took the graph and he drew and he drew a throne sitting there no one was sitting on it but below the throne was a snake and he says now that's your carnal nature you were born with because your first union you had and your first kinsman redeemer your First, you're he called it your nearer kinsman, Satan. &gt;&gt; That's why he's got a right to your mind. &gt;&gt; So, seed into your mind. It's a mind battle. Okay. So, if you could draw a throne right here and have a snake below it. He says, "Now when the word of God goes through the hearing gate, goes through the womb of the mind into the very heart. Thy word, oh Lord, have I hid in my heart &gt;&gt; that I learn not to sin against you." So it comes in here. And when this seed is germatized, at that time when the sperm comes to the egg, it germmitizes it. It's fertilized. And guess what? born again. There's really been a change in me. Hallelujah. I'm a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm born again. I'm born of the spirit because thy word is spirit and it's life. And so the that that sperm spermmitzoa went through the hearing gate. Faith cometh by hearing through the mind into the heartates that seed. And guess what? Now you're a new creature. And he says he put an X on that serpent. He said your first nature which had rule over you. &gt;&gt; He says now is dead and Christ sits on the throne room. &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely? &gt;&gt; So you begin to now understand the concept of body. May you be wholly sanctified &gt;&gt; in your body and in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? and in your soul, body, spirit, soul. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, even after the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the flesh or carnal man is still present with you to hinder everything you do. &gt;&gt; How many have ever recognized that? &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Satan will use your own weaknesses against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan has a right now to attack you by using any of the physical senses. So, he will try to get you to where, oh, I don't feel God. Well, there's a lot of times you don't feel God. God doesn't come to you through this five physical senses. I don't see him. I don't hear him. I don't feel him. Do you see what I'm saying? He's not using. There's a lot of times you don't feel God &gt;&gt; and you've done nothing wrong. You're just going through life and then all of a sudden you wake up one morning, you don't really feel anointed. And so you don't I don't feel God. Where is you? Oh God, why don't I feel you? Well, listen. God is weaning you away &gt;&gt; from feelings. He's going to walk let you walk through dry places. &gt;&gt; He's going to let you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; Okay? God is God. He's a father God. He teaches you to come away and wean you away from feeling on the outward man. &gt;&gt; So he will pull his anointing away from you and then watch your reaction. Are you going to go whine and cry in the corner? I don't feel it. Maybe I'm not a Christian. Maybe maybe it's not really real. I'll stop. &gt;&gt; Come on. There's a lot of times I don't feel like a Christian, but I'm not going by feelings. &gt;&gt; I'm going by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because faith is the evidence of things not seen and the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; I have something. because we walk by faith not by sight. So there's a far greater than these five physical senses &gt;&gt; and then we use the five senses to the spirit band and I remember brother Biscoll said it and he said it's a I use an abbreviation everyone wants to use my car m I c a r my car memory imagination conscience affection and reason okay so you'll have that relationship So next time you think, what are they? Oh, my car memory. So now Satan's going to try to come against your memory. Oh, you did this. He's going to remind you of what you've done wrong. &gt;&gt; Does he ever remind you? &gt;&gt; He anoints your memory of what you've done wrong. And he makes you guilty and say you're not worthy and and this and that. So you beat yourself down or uses your uh conscience. Oh, you know, oh, I I don't know if I was a real I wouldn't have done. And so you got this battle in the mind. We're going to go and we'll talk about each one of those gates. But I think one of the ones that Satan likes to use the most is the channel of reasoning and imagination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I'm not going to get into that right now. James 1 verse4-15 it says, "But every man is temp but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of the devil." &gt;&gt; Come on, get the get the scripture up here. I want you guys to see it. Do we have it there? James 1 14-15. Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is self-inflicted. &gt;&gt; When a man is tempted, I felt such an anointing. Okay. He's drawn away of his own lust. The devil had nothing to do with. He's sitting back there. You did it to yourself. You went to that website. You went over there and you started looking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like I had a brother with me, young brother in Flagstaff. We were sitting there in the ch in the in in the car and we come to a red light there. There was a woman walking across the street and uh and she was very immorally dressed. Very immoral. And he said, "Why look at that Jezebel? Look at" and he began I said, "Stop. You're lusting." H look at this. Oh, stop it. I said, brother Ram said, when an immoral woman walks in, he says, what do you do, brothers? &gt;&gt; Turn your head. &gt;&gt; Look to the cross. That's why he said you should keep a cross on your rearview mirror. &gt;&gt; Look to the cross. Look to Calvary. Every man when he is tempted, he's drawn away of his own lust. And when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death. &gt;&gt; Only by the Holy Ghost baptism will a man be able to overcome the flesh and bring it into subjection. &gt;&gt; But how do we do it? There must be an answer. The only way for you keep under subjection your body is to crucify the flesh. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to crucify the flesh? Paul said, "I die daily." Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll look at this. It's called death to self. Now, death to self is actually death to yourself will not my will, &gt;&gt; thine be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's death to self like the children of Israel came out of Egypt. God got them out of Egypt, but Egypt was still in them. &gt;&gt; You can come out of the world, but is the world out of you? Because they started when temptations and trials come, they wanted they they wanted the leaks and garlics. Oh, I remember. We had it better back then. They turned their backs and forgotten the whip of the task masters. They died in the wilderness and never crossed over Jordan. Now watch, Brother Bram said this in the breach. Now you went out to him. He couldn't get into you because the only way he'd get you into you is come through the same process that you have. He'd have to be saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost. Then he'd be your brother. See, now you just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world. He never went all the way over into Canaan. You see, across Jordan and what is Jordan? Death to self. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you see what sanctification is? &gt;&gt; It's death to self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it's wrong to wear an immoral dress. &gt;&gt; Doesn't really convict me. You know, I don't really see that my wearing men's pants is an abomination. Well, wait a second. Is this is this your will? Or are you in love with God enough that you say not my will thine be done. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So death to self is when you cross Jordan and say okay Lord. Okay. One of the hardest things for me to overcome as a young man when I came to the Lord is to cut my hair. I told my dad I'm going to walk on it before I cut it again. Okay. you longhaired hippie. Well, hey, I I hated getting my haircut as a kid. I hated it because you son, you going in there, get in there, get get your hair cut. I'll tell you what, I went to the racetrack. My father was a jockey and back then all of those rednecks on the racetrack and hair started growing long. Hey, Mel, is that your girls you got with you there today? And my dad to you. He says, "I hope one of these one of these men come over and they take some horse clippers and they just clip your hair." You know, I told him, I said, "Dad, if they do, I'll kill them." I meant it, too. I was so rebellious. See, it's a rebellious spirit. &gt;&gt; The rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like caught the snake. [Music] I guess it's not so bad. No. Do you understand? The crossing over Jordan is actually death. Some of you guys are laughing. It's so good. It's death to self. &gt;&gt; If you love me, you keep my commitment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, most of the time, people have just enough of God to be miserable, &gt;&gt; right? Just enough. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you a quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in the eagle in her nest. You know, a chicken is a bird just the same as the eagle is, but he's an earthbound creature. Oh, he can flop and fly a little bit. He can hardly get his feet off the ground. It reminds me of some of those so-called Christianity we got today. Just enough religion to make you miserable. You ever seen somebody miserable going to church? Do we have to? &gt;&gt; In separation from unbelief. Ahab was a borderline believer. Just a fellow that believed enough to make him miserable. Did you ever see people like that? Well, they have conception that they would like to go to church and do right. They feel like it might make them a better social person in their social lives. And maybe for the sake of their children, they think they ought to or maybe belong to church. If that isn't the most miserable person I know of, I tell you the best that the best of cut loose all shorelines and launch out into the deep or don't go at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Ouch. &gt;&gt; Just simply stay home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or either go all the way for Christ. &gt;&gt; All the way. I'm going all the way. Huh? &gt;&gt; Miserable. &gt;&gt; They have just enough of God to be miserable, but they won't go all the way. &gt;&gt; So he says, God wants somebody who will really go all the way. give you all you got, soul, body, and spirit to the service of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wow. Paul tells, "I have a war within my members." Remember Paul had a way of being religious, right? He said, "I was a Hebrew of Hebrews, a Pharisee of Pharisees. I had zeal persecuting the church." You know, he goes on and he said, "If anyone has something to boast, I the more circumcised the eighth day children of Israel." And he goes on and on. Boast, boast, boast. Paul know what Paul knew what it was like to be religious. And concerning the law, blameless, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So now he doesn't have a relationship with God. So God meets him on the road to Damascus. And there's where we had read where he was telling King Agrippa. But you see him being a Pharisee, a Pharisee means actor. Do you guys know that? &gt;&gt; Pharisee means actor. &gt;&gt; And some people are so such good Pharisees in the church. They're actors. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I'm a believer. Yes, I sing the songs. Yes, I believe he's a prophet. You actor. &gt;&gt; You can tell by your life. &gt;&gt; You're not living what he tells us to do. You call him prophet, but don't do what he does he tells you to do. You're not made holy by the dress you wear. &gt;&gt; You're not made holy by the law you keep. &gt;&gt; You're not holy because you believe the truth. &gt;&gt; You're only holy because you have faith in God. And God imputes unto you righteousness. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even against our own better judgment, &gt;&gt; God still loved me. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If, listen, let's be honest. If you had to choose yourself to be the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour, would have you chose yourself? &gt;&gt; You'd have said, "Are you kidding me?" You'd laugh. &gt;&gt; Who me? Yeah. No, not me. I got too many problem. I got I got all kinds of complexes. Yeah, but God chose the weak to confound the &gt;&gt; wise. &gt;&gt; Has God not chosen the foolish things of this world &gt;&gt; to confound the wise? Look at you. Paul said, "Look among you as any are any big governors or rulers of Nah. We're a bunch of no names." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at us. God has chosen us. &gt;&gt; Amen. to make foolish the wisdom of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God met Paul on the road to Damascus. Okay, let me bring this to a a close here and read the scripture. Romans 7 17-2. And you know what? I'm going to have you uh brother Mark read Romans chapter 7. Romans 7. verses 17 through 25. Now, now we're going to show you Paul says, "I got a problem. &gt;&gt; When I try to do good, &gt;&gt; evil is present with me. And that which I want to do, I don't do. &gt;&gt; That which I don't want to do, that I do." &gt;&gt; Any of you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I've done it many times. &gt;&gt; I wanted to do right, I didn't. &gt;&gt; And that which I didn't want to do, that I did. So go ahead, brother Martin. Romans 7 verse1 17. &gt;&gt; Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's not me, it's sin. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; For I know that in me that is in my flesh. &gt;&gt; In my flesh. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Mark. &gt;&gt; Dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me. But how to perform that which is good I find not. &gt;&gt; Wow. For the good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that, I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Look at that. I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. &gt;&gt; The inward man. I delight after the law of God after the inward man, not the flesh man. But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. Oh wretched man that I am. Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin. &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched, vile man that I am. Paul said he was the chiefest of sinners. &gt;&gt; Do you think he was lying? You know, the thing that I love about Paul, Paul doesn't go in and expound in all the things that he did wrong. He didn't say, "Well, I I was a drinker drunkard. I ran with women. I was this and that and on on. He doesn't He doesn't tell us anything. I like it when a man can get up and give his testimony. He doesn't have to go back through all, well, I'll tell you what. I I did this and I did that. No. Hey, no. I don't even want to give Satan the glory. &gt;&gt; Just say, I was the chiefest of sinners. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; End of story. &gt;&gt; He's not lying. &gt;&gt; He had a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; He even persecuted the church. He killed Christians. He even held the the coat of those that were stoning Stephen. He saw and brother Brennham said Paul saw them stone Stephen, the first martyr in the New Testament. They saw he saw them stone Stephen and he held their jackets while they threw the stones and they saw him he saw Stephen die. And it so affected him that the rest of his life he can't get away from it. And he desired to be martyed. &gt;&gt; He said if somebody can give their life like that, &gt;&gt; what about me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Even when who was it that took the girdle of Paul? He prophesied you're going to go to Rome, you're going to be Who was it? Huh? Say it. &gt;&gt; Agabus. Thank you. Sometimes the harder I chase it. So Agabus, he he took the girdle of Paul. And he said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, he that wears this shall be bound and trouble will find him in in Rome or in wherever it was he was going." He said, "Don't break my heart. I'm more than willing &gt;&gt; to go and suffer for the cause of Christ." &gt;&gt; Now, so you know, there must be a death to self. Are we all aware of that? When Jesus bids you to come, he bids you come and die. For he who seeks to lose his life shall find it. But he who seeks to save his life will lose it. &gt;&gt; There is a cost to disciplehip. &gt;&gt; You have to give your life to him. &gt;&gt; And the only way to get him on the control room is a death to self, &gt;&gt; self-will, either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; And when you have faith and say, "Come into my heart, Lord Jesus." He comes in. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're born again. and you're conceived of God and now you become a new creature in Christ, but now you're a babe in Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Now, Galatians 2 and 20. And musicians, if you've come, because we're going to go directly into communion here, and I I I trust I that this was a blessing to you. I I didn't plan on preaching tonight, but I just sat down and I looked at something. I said, "You know what? A couple things. I'll just say a couple things. &gt;&gt; Galatians 2 and 20. I am crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live. &gt;&gt; How can you be crucified and live? &gt;&gt; Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. What is Christ? The anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointing. The anointed word liveth in me. I show you a mystery. It's no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Galatians 5 and 24. And they that are Christ Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust. And Galatians 6:14 says, "But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] There's where many people miss that place where the seed is germatized inside of them because they only come so far. Brother Bram said that denomination people are satisfied with just justification. They're satisfied with a little bit of sanctification. They're religious. They light candles. They recite prayers. They're told that that's all you need to do. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Or say the one to Hail Mary, mother of God. And just say prayers and say repetition. Jesus said, "Call no man your father." And yet, how many millions of the people in the world are deceived by a religious way? They have a form of godliness, but deny the very power thereof. God, I don't want a form of religion. I don't want this message to become the Amish, the Menanites, the people that isolate themselves and they just horse and buggy and they want to go back to the old ways and if we're not careful that that's what we do. You kids, you're going to the girls, you're going to wear a dress. The boys, you're going to do this. Boys, you're going to cut your hair. You're not going to wear shorts and on and on and next thing you know. Yes. Okay. Yes. And but the Bible says be not conformed &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed by the renewing of what? &gt;&gt; Your mind. The power of transformation is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally and it transforms you from being a conforming Christian &gt;&gt; to a transformed believer and then then &gt;&gt; you're different. You talk different. You walk different. [Music] Some of these things that you teach, they may seem so very simple, but how many of the people within the message don't have a clue [Music] of brother Brenam's teaching. He said though you can understand all the mysteries like Paul give your body to be burnt all of those things and have not love sounding brass and a tinkling symbol you don't have it because God is love the capstone the capstone the stature of a perfect Amen. This is the very headship, the very mind of God. And brother Rem said, "That's love." &gt;&gt; I fell in love with Jesus Christ years ago. I'll never forget. I was probably a boy of about 8 years old. Went to a place called um Green Oak Ranch Boys Camp. Never been to a Never Jesus Christ. never heard these things. Never had anybody read the Bible and went to this religious camp and they had a little train and I was mesmerized by this little choo choo train and they had an engineer with an engineer cap and everything and kids the only way that you could ride the train was you had to memorize a verse. Oh, good grief. I got to memorize a verse first to get on the train. Yeah. So, they gave me a little thing. Romans 5'8. First Bible verse I ever me ever. Romans 5'8. But God commendeth his love toward us. [Music] &gt;&gt; That while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I rode the train. I memorized the verse. I've never forgot it. The next verse was John 3:16. For God so loved the world, [Music] he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; I fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the name of this song with it? Huh? Be it unto me. Be it unto &gt;&gt; Let's stand for a minute. Change your position. &gt;&gt; According to thy word. According to thy promises I can stand secure. Harve upon my heart. The truth that sets me free. According to thy thy word, oh Lord, be it unto me. [Music] Brother Mark, would you read 1 Corinthians chapter 11 for me? [Music] Because here it is, the night of his betrayal. It's called the last supper. He's having communion before he goes off the scene. Do you think it's coincidence that the last sermon Brother Bran preaches communion before he goes off the scene? The very example of Christ in this hour preaches communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goes off the scene. 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23. Go ahead. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." &gt;&gt; Play very softly. Good. Just a couple notes just softly softly. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often we you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come." Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. &gt;&gt; Let a man examine himself. &gt;&gt; And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you. And many sleep. &gt;&gt; Why are there many sick and many sleep? Because they are not discerning the Lord's body. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when we come together to eat, tar one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together under condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If my deacon brethren or the brethren that are going to help serve the communion tonight, will they come forward here? Can you imagine Jesus sitting there with them and he said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. Take of this bread and drink of this cup. For in doing so, you'll do this in remembrance of me. So, here we are tonight judging ourselves. You judge yourself. And if you judge yourself, you made a mistake, confess it right now. Tell God, I'm sorry. There's none of us perfect. None of us that can say even all last week, I did everything right. No, &gt;&gt; you know what? We're all failures. &gt;&gt; But through Christ, I can do all things. I am more than an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, because of his blood, I can say, Lord, I'm sorry. Put it under the blood. And guess what? I have a right to come up here and partake of it. And so would you hold that? Would you bow your heads now as I break the bread? Heavenly Father, I break this bread. we do &gt;&gt; in remembrance of you. &gt;&gt; For you said, if we would break the bread &gt;&gt; that it would be a symbol, &gt;&gt; this is not your body. It is only a symbol. So let a man eat of that bread and drink of that cup. &gt;&gt; Father, I ask a blessing upon this bread and those that partake of it this evening. May there be healings, &gt;&gt; revelations, manifestations in lives. lives brought closer to you and in greater love with you. I thank you. I praise you. I bless this bread in Jesus name. Amen. All right, go ahead and take the lid off that there. Brother Mike, I'm not going to raise these up, but I'll just lay my hands on bow your heads again. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, here in these canisters and these little couplets are a symbol of your life's blood. It's the wine. &gt;&gt; Wine has life in it just as blood has life. &gt;&gt; So, Father, I I bless this wine. I ask you let those that drink of it &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, let the scenes of Calvary come before him. And thank you for the blood which cleanses us from all sin. &gt;&gt; Bless those that partake tonight. I ask in Jesus Christ's name &gt;&gt; and for his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's some of you that have never been here during a communion service, you may be seated. You go ahead and be seated right now. All of you. And you wait for a deacon to dismiss you and we'll come you know each side will come and then you'll go out and just follow who's before you. Amen. Brother Chris, if you would come up here and let's go ahead and put some music on there. Brother Matthew.

St. John chapter 13. These glasses I wear, they were on my desk for the past five years. Somebody left them in the church. So if they look like your glasses, I have claimed them. But they work perfect. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart, see it was in his mind for a long time, but now he went from his mind to his heart. And the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God. He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. And after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? And Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter?" Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." And Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou has no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, also my hands and my head. And Jesus saith to him, he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet, but is clean ever wit. Ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, you are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and ye say, well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord, neither he that sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. I speak not of you all, I know whom I have chosen, but that the scripture might be fulfilled. He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his head against me. My we are going to partake now of foot washing. Again, this is one of the ordinances that we do. He said, I've done an example. Do you think that you are greater than your Lord? That you shouldn't do it that well, I'll just pass it up. You know, whatever excuse. No, I've done unto you as an example that you might do unto others. So, we do that. And sisters, if you would be dismissed now, you'll go ahead and go through these doors and go off to the side here. We'll dismiss. And and brother Matt, if you just want to play some music and you, brethren, you stay here and we'll wait until most of the sisters are out of the sanctuary and then we'll wash one another's feet.
