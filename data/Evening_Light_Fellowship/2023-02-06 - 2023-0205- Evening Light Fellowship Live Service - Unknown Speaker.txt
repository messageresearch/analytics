brother John how many years have you been here with us I've had an office held a position or church now going on 30 years 30 years I would like you to come up here for just a second and then I will say a few words too because I know you said you wanted to say something would you please take this time thank you brother John God bless each and every one of you this morning I knew this day would eventually come as it does with each and every one of us and I am I want to share a couple things on my heart if that would be okay I'll just take a minute or two um as we just pre-mentioned I have held an office now going on 30 years in this church a year as a trustee and many years as a deacon and then the last 20 years of the head taken at a church over the last seven or eight years I have been pleasantly pleased to see the tremendous potential in the young people of the Next Generation coming up within this body I see god-given talents of young men and young women to be the the future deacons and trustees and the future School teachers and the ones that have the gifts of help and the ones that are going to continue to take the Baton and carry it forward next year I'll be 66 years old brother Ron and I have walked a long long road together many triumphs mini battles many great great experiences and sometimes many heartaches but I just want to say that if I had to do it all over again if I had to do everything all over again I wouldn't change one thing I would do the same thing that I've done for 30 years all over again God has been good God has been good I just want to say that I've worked by many fine men brother Mike Yale brother Chris brother Matt brother Joshua brother Pierre brother Stephen prink here for many seasons and last but not least our precious brother Arnold as consistent as the tides of the ocean always that is supposed to duty never failing I honor every one of you Brethren this morning I want to thank each and every one of you for standing by our side it wasn't always perfect but we always stuck together put our shoulder to the wheel to get done what we needed to get done we never fussed them much or had many divisions we just sort of all got along and got it all done isn't that the way it's supposed to be sure I honor the trustees and all the different ones that I've worked with over the years Brother Andy and all the different ones my goodness we love you buddy and I just want to say thank you all the other departments that have helped us become one in unity in one to reach a common goal and one to to press forward in Christ when our Lord and savior came down from a place of absolute perfection he descended down down down and he he made himself lower than the angels and he came to a place where he took on a form not a form of a great conquering King that would destroy the Roman armies no he took on the form of a servant and from the pastorship all the way down to every office of this church there's no big eyes and little u's were servants we're servants to who the apple of God's eye his elect seed this is all about servitude there is nothing in any of us that are worth anything unless we have Christ indwelling inside of us that's right and he is so pleased because he said if you do it unto the least of one of these you do it unto me the least of one of these this is the reward the reward is to take care of God's sheep it's all about the Sheep if the Sheep aren't here we don't have a church we don't have a body so I just want to thank you for the privilege of being able to serve you for the last three decades and I want to say it's been an immense pleasure to serve you I now as I see the potential of the young people in our church I'm ready to pass the Baton I know that this next generation is a powerful generation such potential on them and it's makes me so pleased that I can step down now and say my goodness everything's in control God's got it all in control amen now I get to have the honor that I haven't got to do very much in 30 years and as the sit down next to my best friend the one that taught this prideful arrogant born and raised DC city slicker yeah how to learn how to give to other people how to learn how to live for other people besides myself thank you honey so I just wanted to share that on my heart this morning sorry if I'm a little emotional I had some really wonderful times with brother Gideon in Africa in different places yeah Rebecca we're praying for you God bless you richly and I will now decrease and let others increase and I will sit there and I will praise the Lord and I will feed on the word God bless the Sheep of God Amen [Applause] amen the Bible says for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus and great will be their reward can you say Amen to that brother John has been a faithful uh Deacon a brother for me he's been worked very very closely with me uh he's uh he's watched my back I was looking carefully brother John if I could see any blood stains on your shirt because I know you've taken a few uh we all have eh but uh I appreciate all of these these deacons here they serve me they served me well brother John you have been my head Deacon for all these years I appreciate it I see you're already retired you're growing a beard you're going to go sit down yeah you had never done that so yeah fishing hunting huh brother Mike yelled is going to be my head Deacon from here on brother Michael today I have a board meeting

foreign [Music] use the twenty dollars wisely give him a big round of applause God bless you brother amen Hallelujah let's all Stand Together let's sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] but now [Music] many days [Music] it is [Music] foreign father is we now come to this portion of the service father [Music] I am going to be totally dependent upon you I need you to come and use this vessel to speak to your people take this mine which is right now troubled and Scattered and plagued with humanness and carnalities and all kinds of things but may I have for a moment the mind of Christ let that mind be in me this morning that your people would be blessed I ask Heavenly Father that you will just have Supreme control [Music] quieten my nerves come and comfort thy servant to God as only you can we have our faith and our trust in you and we know that faith is a gift of God and it's come it comes to us by grace it is nothing we did or earned or said [Music] but it's a gift of God lest any one of us should boast therefore we can say father what Amazing Grace that you will give to every one of your elect that one day as they walk through those Gates of Pearl and they stand on the threshold of the foundation that you have provided for them Father they too will say God it was nothing but Amazing Grace and we depended upon that this morning I asked give me a large portion of Grace this morning to get through this sermon I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you musicians and all of you certainly enjoyed those uh song specials and everything and let's just remain standing turn with me book of Zephaniah 3. and verse 9 Zephaniah chapter 3 and verse 9. for then will I turn the to the people a pure language that they may call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent may God add the blessing to his word you all may be seated this morning in God's presence turn with me now in your bibles if you would please too First Peter chapter 1. First Peter chapter 1 verses 7 through 9. that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing we Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls do you see the end result of faith is the Salvation of your souls notice verse 7 again there the trial of your faith every one of you will be tried there is no exemption there is no tunnel there is no easy way and let me tell you life is not easy he said all things will work together for the good it did not say they would all be good but he would use bad to produce good I have faith in God that he he knows what he's doing first John chapter 5. verses 1 through 5. whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments as and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God may God bless his word to every heart this morning and father I'm asking you for once again Sovereign Grace I would like to title my sermon this morning learning to speak God's language and I want to take a subject of speak the word now I don't know if any of you have ever had an opportunity to learn another language but it's Unique it's different in the first little while that you start to learn another language and you try to enunciate you try to formulate you try to conjugate a sentence in another language it's so foreign to your ear you chuckle you think did that make any sense to he who was listening to me just to learn another language is foreign to your ear and you must overcome your shyness and your immaturity to try to speak it you must have boldness I remember that my wife who was actually far better in German especially in the conjugation of German and everybody that knew me they knew I was unafraid to attempt to speak German and I always said that yes I know I make many mistakes yes I know my grammar is not correct yes I know that the feminine masculine and neuter gender is not exactly correct yes I know that I probably use the the informal uh hostu instead hobbin Z and yet I was unafraid and I began to to to speak it and and oh did I make mistakes how many of you have ever tried to learn another language and you realize oh my to try to even think in that language um is extremely hard but much less try to speak it and so you've got to get over the fear and I'm I'm taking this somewhere this morning so listen carefully because we have to learn to speak God's language God has a language and that language is Faith I'm not talking about a dialect that you were born with I'm not talking about this speech that you use to communicate one with another but I'm talking about a language that God uses regardless of your speech or your dialect or your country or your color or your ethnicity or your education God will speak to every one of you through faith and as he speaks to you as a father speaks to his child and he says say dada it's important that you teach the little children say Dad not Mama that that you look at them say Dad Dad they go mama no dada but anyway there's something about it that as you begin to take this little child and they began to now formulate in their mind this language that they're hearing and by the hearing of the ear it goes into the mind and they try to put it together and they learn sometimes quickly on certain things and other things they don't but nevertheless they learn and then they begin I don't know if you've ever seen a little child just before they really go to formulating it they have all kinds of gibberish and they just sit there and they chitter and chatter and they say all kinds of stuff and you're wondering I wonder what that kid is saying now I remember my son Matthew we thought he would never learn to talk because Rebecca was his translator for every grunt and groan and she carried him around long enough until his feet were dragging and she held him on her hip and she you know and he goes I go what in the world does did he just he wants water uh he wants food she would translate I said Rebecca stop let this kid learn to speak himself I want all of you to understand you don't need somebody speaking for you you need to make yourself understood quit this gibberish quit this immature talking learn to speak and learn to come boldly Before the Throne because if you have got something to say say it amen it's God's language the language of faith you have to learn to speak it in every situation and all that we go through and I want to take this subject of speaking the word because as God speaks to you through faith he is actually giving you the language of the word that it's written in because it's an encrypted message it is not given to those who have wisdom and education and learning but it is something that is given to the elect and brother Branham said in every elect predestinated seed is the ability to hear you have a receiver you have the ability to hear what God is speaking and since the confounding of the language at Babel man has been in such a confused State and let me tell you this age is an age of confusion it's getting worse and worse seducers and educated men and it just goes on and on until they are a bunch of educated idiots pardon the expression that's probably not good terminology man has constantly battled with understanding of one another it's hard enough in English to make ourselves understood am I understanding what I think you thought you said which you know that I'd like to read that thing up here one day do I understand what I think you were wanting to say and everything we we we talk over and around I mean you know my wife lesser heart women have this ability to to when they communicate they they they go before after they use all of the the you know prerequisites and everything and I see cut to the chase stop stop it you know you're you're always not letting me speak did you wreck the car how bad are you okay all right now do the fill in anyway many times we as men are not good listeners and the older we get you would think that with the gray hair would come wisdom but sometimes we find out that we still do not understand one another because we're in a confusing world the language can be a barrier for Fellowship because if we do not know what one another are wanting to say to one another uh our fellowship is so limited God's Fellowship to you depends on how much of his language you will understand otherwise it's just vain speaking when we don't understand one another it brings confusion and if there was ever a Time when the author of confusion who's the author of confusion the devil and if there's ever a time of confusion and people not knowing who they are and what gender they are and what identity they are of and uh you know they just don't know I thank God that God has given to us a message that speaks God's language and lets you know where you come from and that you're a part of God right that you you you're not wandering around wondering about your identity because your identity speaks to you of your destiny now let me just say this and I probably will go into this in a greater depth later but brother Branham as he's coming into the maturity of his ministry he's realizing that the word of God Is So revealed to him that he cannot help the third pull from manifesting at times we all know the third pull is the revealing of the word he had to know his position he had to know that he was sent for a purpose in fact when he thought his ministry was over God had to say it ain't over this up furtherance of your ministry about the time when the doors are closing and people are are are not inviting him anymore guess what his ministry is just beginning the shock had to be taken away from the wheat so brother Brenham said on that day when God came down and saw all the men there and Babble and then building a tower and so on and so forth he said let us confuse the tongue and so here was a bunch of prideful men that we're trying to achieve something by their own intellect and their scientific ability and their education and God said I gotta I'm gonna have to go down and confound them unless they go ahead and build the very thing of the imagination of their heart and so God took that group of men and proud and boastful and scientific and confounded them but then God on the day of Pentecost had to take humble yielded vessels and give them a new language and what it was was it was not a new tongue a new dialect it was them to speak of the Great and Powerful wonderful works of God that's God's language so he takes one and confounds then and he turns right back around because God is one we are one body One Faith one Lord one baptism one one one one what language are we gonna speak in heaven let me tell you it's going to be God's language and that language is Faith and faith is a gift of God so guess what you don't got to go to Babel to have Babble translate you won't need to have Google Translate what it is you'll have a Holy Spirit and it'll translate in fact I'm going to say something that may throw you a curveball you won't have to do a lot of talking over there you could just be sitting with someone walking with someone and look at them and go why you're catching one another's thoughts knowing the thoughts intents of the heart you won't need this mouse anymore you won't need to speak it because there'll be something inside of you that will have a communication far greater then these mortal lips [Applause] in fact just watch the natural Hume uh Union of husband and wife after they've been together for a while guess what he speaks half a sentence and then may he may stop and Go off into Oblivion for a moment and she goes I know exactly what you're thinking and she finishes the sentence my wife does that to me quite often in fact after I get done with this service you will say you forgot this and you forgot thank God for wives huh we need them they're a help me I'm realizing the more and more that I need her when I drive turn here oh turn right that's the way home well thank you honey honey I'd be lost without you telling me I saw a little clip this guy his wife talking to him and everything like this and and says I'm so glad for my wife because she tells me how to get home and said where would I be without my wife and so he says I'm in the car and I'm driving around a field going in circles and a police officer comes over and said what are you doing buddy he says well I'm I'm trying to get home he says well what's the matter and he said my wife's not here he said well I'm just going to give you a warning don't go out with her again foreign okay now watch this on the Seal of Christ in 1955 I want to show you what brother Brahm said because I want to bring us all back to understand that God speaks a language so now what was confused at Babel is returned at Pentecost remember Pentecost is an experience okay on the Seal of Christ at the day of Pentecost where tongues was confused with Babylon he brought them back into one fellowship at Pentecost amen what the devil did at Babylon scattered Brotherhood God brought Brotherhood together at Pentecost Holy Spirit himself speaking through the people to the people hey I believe that well what do you know about that we hear them in our own language what do you know about that see science and education are the Devil's Bible it destroys the nutrients within the food takes away our nourishment brother Brown said the reason you are the Way You Are he says it's because the food you eat it has no longer the nourishments and the vitamins and no matter how many Big Macs you eat you will never get the nourishment that you think that you really need out of it especially with your diet coke and supersize the fries diseases sicknesses mental inabilities and different things that are coming on the face of the Earth brother Branham said women go into menopause at an early age why because we've taken all the nutrients because we think we're smarter than God so they hybrid the corn they hybrid the wheat they hybridize the everything that's supposed to have seed and so now we live in an age where everything is becoming seedless no nutrients looks bigger and better but guess what don't have that nutrients that you need now I'm not here on on health and and all of this and and I want you to have nothing but Keel for lunch today uh no that's not it although I believe that some of us should be eating healthier okay just be aware of that because it catches up to you as you get older amen all right so everything that's consumed by the masses today is nothing but hybrid foods that have lost their nutrients in their vitamins now brother Branham says in 1955 he takes a sermon called law Paul speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather the law of the shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show what the Perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I am weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian hello have you ever said those words why did you choose someone like me that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right there how many of you believe he has a language what is it unbelief it's dealt so when you start doubting and you start having all of these questions there's nothing wrong with the question but you better know where you're getting your answers from you're just talking his language right then so I want to say if if unbelief and doubt is the devil's language there must be a language of God his is only belief it is have faith in God amen that's his language we must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all of my heart let your testimony always your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts and don't entertainment well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that's like the farmer that said he couldn't he he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from Rusty that's a good thing you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior all things are mined by God and I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you watch this talk about speaking God's language God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said that he's a high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it we believe it and we confess it he said many times the holy spirit is powerless to bring you Deliverance to bring you healing to bring you the things that you are asking for why he said because you're not speaking God's language and he said you've got to profess it first you he says before you see it confess it before it happens confess it he says because the holy spirit will force your body to come into subjection of what you're seeing yeah amen it's time for us to start speaking by faith that's God's language that he speaks and we've got to learn to speak it so quit babbling and start formulating Faith sentences speak the word yeah well it it sounds so foreign I know because you were born into this world speaking lies you spoke the devil's language but now God's trying to teach you to believe him that's why in those five indications of the spoken word he said they were sovereignly given he said sovereignly given at the time I wasn't asking God to give me squirrels I wasn't asking God to resurrect that little fish I wasn't I was there when an event happened I want all of you to understand there are events there are trials there are things there are accidents there are things that are going to happen in your life and I want you to be sensitized to the fact that God is there and he may be having a sovereign moment for you to speak the word now it's not something watch God sovereignly gave it this isn't something that he was out there fasting and praying for no Sovereign I want you to understand you don't work it up just let God have his way be sensitized enough that if he speaks you'll listen foreign 1959 12 23 right before Christmas he says he that man was so completely yielded to the devil till the devil used his tongue to talk now you can be so completely yielded to God till God can use your tongue to talk the Bible says whatsoever you yield your members to you become the servant thereof either to righteousness or unrighteousness I say God let me be so sensitive let me be so yielded to you that when I speak it ain't me speaking amen that's right that's what I claim any sermon that I ever preached that had any meaning to it is when I got yielded got William bran I'm out of the way and Christ could take in and start talking because he can speak in a language comprende for stage two what language you want me to say it in do you understand God speaks in a language and as you hear him speak and you see him on what he's doing and you see the opportunities in the Bible of what when there was situations he's spoke to the situation now as the prophet of God began to mature in his ministry and quit listening to all of the dissenting voices and quit forgetting the doors are closing it looks like he's Ministry is washed up it's not washed up it's refined you've got all the chaff away and he says now William Branham so now the revealed word to him cannot contain itself until the word emanates and God didn't morph are you understanding that the language of God now coming down into a son of man Ministry Now understand this it wasn't William Branham it was the son of man revealing to you the son of man so what is it it's the language of the son of man speaking emanating bringing forth William Branham you're a Son of God you are no longer the son of Charles and Ella Branham he's coming into his place where he's now speaking he says I've always been troubled my whole Ministry to speak to this mountain he said I've never understood it I preached everywhere around in the Bible that portion of scripture and I've never preached about it but watch the sovereignty of that third poll every time what was it speak the word formulated William Branham what do you have need of squirrels I mean to you and I squirrels really yeah what seems to be very minor in Man's eyes is very big in Gods a little fish really and yet God's mindful and so now this young son of man is coming to the place that when he speaks it's the same as God speaking Revelation is god making his word known to you for faith is a revelation faith is illumination to your understanding when you get it and it opens up to you your face lightens up in fact the whole Revelation had lit up so much to Moses that his countenance shown with brightness and they said build yourself faith is catching what the spirit is saying faith is the language that God speaks regardless of what dialect you were raised up you have to learn a new language the language of Heaven the language of the Holy Spirit and it may sound so foreign to your ear huh when you learn a new language it's so foreign you you speak it you giggle huh I remember I asked my friend Freedom how do I say to the man at the post office do you have a writing pen and he says oh a what a cool subscriber German is German is enunciated the way it's written French forget it French huh have you have ever tried to enunciate au revoir the way it's written when you say I'll feed a Zine I'll feed a zine I'll see you again and and and so I I went up I had my friend Freedom behind me I am so excited because I would I don't know how to ask do you have a writing pen a ballpoint pen do you have one so I get up there and and uh here Franken that was his name the the the Meister at the post office so I said here Franken Peterson and freedom behind me nine nine no I said but that that's what you told me yeah but you don't know him he's he's he you're supposed to have the formal well I said well then but that's what you taught me so I say so how do I tell hey Franken he says uh hop and z Robinson crazy American people we force everybody to speak English in every country we go to because you know what we're lazy we make everybody huh you speak English you speak English I don't care where you go you speak English you don't even try in their language let me tell you let me give you a hint if you ask everybody in any country do you speak English most of the time they'll say no they they don't but if you try in their language to speak to them yeah they'll say yeah I am fishing yeah a little bit a little bit and they'll try to help you how many of you try to speak to your heavenly father in a language that he doesn't want you to speak in Lord help me this morning because I have a thought that I want to get across to you and my speech may not be able to have the ability but I will say this I will take this broken sermon and I will speak it and I will let my heavenly father translate it to you so that you will understand amen Hebrews 4 verses 1 through 3 let us therefore fear lest a promise being less left us of entering into his resin any of you should seem to come short of it For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it what good is this message what good is 1200 sermons what good is to press play and not hear what the spirit is saying to the church if we're not careful what happens is we make it some form of religion and you let everyone else you let the prophet you let everyone else do your religion for you you press play you light the candle you plug in the recorder no he wants you to talk he wants you to speak he wants you to say something for the spirit and the bride didn't say the spirit and the tape player will the bride have a Ministry before the coming of the Lord yep sure uh-huh he said it'll be the fivefold ministry he said God never used mechanical devices to preach the gospel probably three to five direct quotes he said God has always chosen man is God's element I want all of you to understand that God wants to use you he wants to speak to you and he wants to have a dialect with you and he and he wants you to start speaking father I believe your word your word is true and you start repeating back to him what he is telling you and now you have conversation Faith doesn't look at symptoms and conditions Faith looks at the promises of God's word otherwise let me tell you everything you go through in this life all of it is Trials trials here trials there if you're not in a trial or you're coming out of a trial you're going into another one at another time trial after trial and the trying of your faith is more precious than gold I didn't know I needed so much gold because there are times when I get so tried have you ever lost the ability to speak to God In Prayer when you're hurting that you open your mouth ah have you been there it's a language the Bible says moanings and groanings everything is with a life-giving sound what it is there are times when you cannot express to your heavenly father that what you are going through and you're unable to speak and a Holy Spirit comes and makes intercession you ever cried your eyeballs out you ever laid on your face before God and you're in a trial and you don't even know what to pray for and you're broken foreign the essence of the flower is when it's crushed God took the lily of the valley and he crushed him in Gethsemane there he was In The Garden of Gethsemane father he was under Such trivial to wear sweat and blood mixture come off of his forehead I don't know if any of you have ever been in such travail but blood came off of his forehead he asked the disciples pray with me just want to never had he asked that before and he goes just a far bit away and he's praying and guess what he's in Such trivial oh God let this cup the shame the reproach father let this gut pass for me and then at breath nevertheless not my will what he did is he subjected himself I want all of you to understand no matter what you go through remember he said I will be with you even in you until when the end of the world Hallelujah Faith doesn't look at all of this stuff faith is the power to heal you faith is the power to deliver you faith is the currency that God requires to activate the things of Heaven wow you want to ride the train to Glory you'll need a token you'll need a token that the price has been paid Hallelujah somebody's catching it foreign calling this morning God used my voice this morning to speak to your people Jesus saw potential in the woman that she never saw in herself God saw her and he called her God saw you and he called you he saw cleansing let me let me put it this way he saw seed before cleansing he saw seed he saw a potential before the tourney Jesus told her who she was woman it is not what she said it's what he said you're a daughter of Abraham she didn't know he saw her and called her faith isn't evidence that you are a Seed of Abraham because Abraham your father called those things which were not as though they were this is not the power of positive thinking no sir this is able to speak the word this is let me tell you I'm claiming what God has told me to claim it is me speaking and you know what I'm speaking to storms I'm speaking to Family I'm speaking to sickness I'm speaking to Demons I'm telling demon you've got no right get off my land [Applause] some of you are living with outdated spiritual Hardware majoring on minors systems so slow running you can't even get anything out of a tape or a read your Bible why because you're system is so bogged down just you ever seen those signs that just keep their I hate that thing I I want flash drive I want Marvel stuff I want when I question bang I got the answer none of that give me fix a sandwich and come back and remember everything's still going some of you have been to church [Music] I pray that God touch you give you an upgrade hey man right where you're sitting it's what they did on the day of Pentecost you know what they all got an upgrade why they were under the influence of the cloud and God came down and he energized every one of them with a lick of fire and when he did guess what their hard drive some of your mental Hardware and hard drive is so encumbered by your mental unbelief you need an upgrade life is so full of many trials and testings he didn't say it would be easy he said but I'll be with you even in you till the end it is not the trial that is the problem it's your reaction to the problem is the cuff the cup half empty or half full you need an upgrade you need to defrag your hard drive fragmented up with so much of the nonsense of the world YouTube and Instagram and Facebook are you willing for an upgrade are you willing to admit you're a failure are you um are you willing to admit that you don't know how to speak like you should I'm going to confess to you I'm a failure I'm a failure and when I tried to do good evil is present with me and then which I want to do I don't do I got so broken yesterday crushed crushed I told someone if I could run I would run I said I've got to preach tomorrow I tried to find I tried to find something God what do I say because I'm broken I'm a failure I can't help anyone I realize if I've ever preached something that pricked your heart it was because I yielded to him all right when Jesus discerned her heart told her who she was immediately she got enough upgrade her revelation of who she was loosed her from her infirmities of what she was unto who she was you're a daughter she was free from the bondage of her own mind she's thought so little of herself she accepted her infirmities as a way to punish her listen to this for having done wrong she was doing Penance for her sins some of you are extremely good Catholics and you've done wrong and you don't forgive yourself I got a word for you this morning I got a word for you this morning from your heavenly father you quit beating yourself up from your past failures because God is more concerned of your present loyalty than of your past failures somebody say Amen Watch Me O God cleanse me cleanse me from my own mind cleanse me from my own thinking cleanse me from my own bondage which holds me back ah so some of you are allowing Satan to bind you in all kinds of infirmities because you have never earned the right for your deliverance for your healing for you're losing he sent his word and it healed the people father I am asking you to send the word the logos thought of God to your people And yet when they heard these words the Holy Ghost fell apart have you noticed that here in the last couple years they get all this stuff about classified document what ah Trump had some classified documents and all everybody impeach you classify a document in Mara Del Lago there was he had it out you go Trump so now they find classified documents wow now Biden huh I'm not here to preach about politics but I'm going to tell you right now foreign I got classified documents in my home [Music] they're all over my home they're in my car everywhere I go I leave evidence of classified documents it is an encrypted message that only the elect somebody say Amen have you got classified documents top secret don't tell nobody faith because guess what it's not public information the public won't get it so if you don't get it you must be a publican amen it's not public no it's not a public show God don't clown around for nobody it's encrypted faith will cause the believer to rise above the conditions around you it'll cause you to rise above the nonsense that is taught in the schools critical race Theory there's more racism in America today than it was when they just had gotten rid of slavery why because the conditions are getting worse there's only one group that doesn't have racism that's the bride of Christ there isn't either June or Gentile Brawn or fear no black no white no red no yellow what it is it's all in Christ why because they are his seed amen amen you gotta rise above your problems until you catch a revelation of Who You Are prodigal son had to come to himself one day when he realized he don't belong there when you begin to realize you don't belong there it's when he came to himself what was it he heard from us theophany if you learn to accept your circumstances that surround you you will forsake your own Deliverance how about Jonah in the belly of the whale you talk about a bad circumstance seaweed wrapped you know this is not Walt Disney with him floating with a candle on a cask you know and oh you know no no he he is in the gastric acids of a wheel it's dark huh his skin is getting eaten and guess what he turns how does he know to turn towards Jerusalem you know what he did he says oh I know that if I will turn my face towards Jerusalem so he probably if he could have he turned his face it's probably in this direction guess what the whale did [Music] I go this way listen if you don't cope if you don't come God's provided way he's got a taxi waiting for you and he's going to have you brought to his perfect will if you gotta vomit up on the beach I don't care how God is gonna do it he's got something there to take you where you need to go God will have his way in your life the Bible says the job he had lost everything his children everything camels sheep oxen now he's attacked in his body and he sits there scraping off the boils on his skin there's only two men in the Bible that cursed the day they were born my wife and I going through the book of Jeremiah he says exactly the same words as job I cursed the day I was born it would bend better that I'd be never come forth from my mother's womb that I would have died he said curse it is the man that went to my father blessed are you because you had a son born any of you ever looked at your own life and thought ah why in the world was I even born go through trials and stuff if somebody would have told me the stuff that I go through as a pastor when brother Mike and them wanted to ordain me way back many years ago I would have said Hey Brother Leroy don't want that bowl send somebody else I seen down the road man hey the easiest part of of pastoring a church is preaching because that's a gift okay the rest of it is putting up with everybody else sibling rivalry mommy touched me no I didn't yes he did don't touch me I'll tell you what

at the woman he called her he loosed her from her infirmities he loosed her from her own mental perception when you think of yourself as a loser you're a loser you keep yourself from your true identity and your true self and it keeps itself locked away from you because you don't learn to speak the language I am a son of God oh bound up never able to straighten up in life never allow yourself to rise above your own failures you will never rise until you speak God's language this is not just your pastor speaking to you this is the Holy Spirit using a gift in my life because I want to share with you what he's been sharing with me is that okay we don't need Ministries to tell us what we're not to use the pulpit as a whipping post we don't need Ministries that want to bind us into the legality of church order do this don't do that amen but we need ministers to tell us who we are you know what you're not you need to be told what you are Ministries and Ministers of the third pool Revelation rise up this whole world is falling apart well that's okay it's meant to be why there cannot be another kingdom to come into until this one gets out of the way so it's got to fall apart all

Financial you have not because you asked not and when you ask ask abundantly it doesn't matter how many times that Jesus or the disciples would walk by somebody and perceive they had faith and he said rise and be here straight away when Faith energizes you is it energizing you right now and I'm not looking for some kind of emotion I'm looking for you for Rock Solid Faith I believe brother Ron I
