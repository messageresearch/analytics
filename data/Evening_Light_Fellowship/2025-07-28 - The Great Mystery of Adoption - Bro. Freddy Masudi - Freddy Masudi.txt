Brother Josh, it been a long time since you sang a song special. I'm glad you're singing with them today. &gt;&gt; Lord bless the bus. Uh before we sing this song, we just want to thank the Lord. Um last weekend, as you remember, Baron went to preach uh in Oregon. Um so we went with him, me and my wife. We left our family. Uh we say we're going to go support our pastor over there. And we had great service over there. And uh Sunday during the service while Baron was preaching, I got a call from my son Caleb over here that my son Aaron over there. After church here, they went to my brother-in-law with some brothers to fellowship and he fell and hit his back on the concrete. And it was worse terrible that they had to airlift him to the children hospital. And uh when they gave me the news where Ron was preaching, I went to brother Abel's office. I kneel down. I pray I said, "Lord, we didn't come here to feast. We came here to support your service. We left our kid under your protection. I want my son to be restored completely." &gt;&gt; Amen. After Baron said finished preaching, I told him we prayed and uh over here they were praying too, brothers and sisters. Uh they were really praying and it looks like the more we're praying, the more the situation was getting better. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a head issue. So, uh the doctor kept saying that he's improving, he's improving. and my wife came back Monday morning and um uh I came in the afternoon and Tuesday they released him from the hospital as nothing ever happened. &gt;&gt; So we just want to praise God for that. [Music] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want in green pastures. He makes me lie down. He restores my soul and leads me on for his name. for his great name. Surely goodness, surely mercy [Music] right beside me all my days. And I will dwell in your house forever and bless your holy name. You prepare a table right before me in the presence of all my enies. [Music] Though the arrow flies and the terror of night is at my door, I'll trust you, Lord. Surely goodness, surely mercy, right beside me. all my days. And I will dwell in your house forever and bless your holy name. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, [Music] I will feel. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are on my side. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, [Applause] I will fear all evil. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, [Applause] you are on my side. Surely goodness, surely mercy right beside me all my days. And I will dwell in your house forever. and bless your holy name. And I will dwell in your house forever and bless your holy name.

He wants he's got a couple of things he has upon his heart before we change the order of the service. Brother Ron, turn the service to him. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; God bless you all this morning. I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has given us the ISV in this hour. &gt;&gt; That we might see what's going on in this day because that's a blessing &gt;&gt; of all the people on this earth. God has got an elected predestiny. God bless you, brother Steve. Good to see you here. But God has gotten an elected group predestinated &gt;&gt; that they might see the things of what God is in doing in this hour. I I listened to the tape last night, Christ, the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; My my my brother Brandham is stressing the the fact of what God is doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; He says, "Many times we see what God has done or we anticipate what God will do, but we miss what God is doing." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And he's doing things now. &gt;&gt; Somebody say now. &gt;&gt; It's happening right now. &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word is continuing. The the the word is still unfolding and we thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I bring you greetings from brother Abel and sister Hattie up there in in Portland. We had nice meetings with them. And uh um also brother DDA and sister Lesie Colite. We saw them the last night. They came up to Portland, drove up from the Seattle area and came up and met us and we had dinner and so I bring you their greetings and everything. But uh we have some some church things that we want to take care of this morning. Um and brother Russell Wallace has got a little something he wanted to say and make an announcement to the church. So brother Russell, if you'd come up here at this time. Amen. And uh just while he's coming uh I I had a bunch of stuff that I had to do yesterday. Had to go up to Prescott and do a bunch of work and everything and didn't get home until late uh yesterday. So I took the opportunity. We have a visiting minister who is from Congo. And so we're going to have him be ministering. So all of the Congalles and French-speaking people here will be doubly blessed because you'll hear it in French and in English. So the Lord bless you, brother Russell, if you would. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Good morning, saints. God bless you. &gt;&gt; So we're this is a chance to tell you how much we love you and how much we'll miss you in the future. Um three years ago when we started attending service here, our family was at a crossroads at the local assembly and this was a a really easy choice for us. Uh some of our oldest and dearest friends on earth are in this assembly. Uh there those are friends we Elizabeth and I chummed with when we were still single and uh precious old friends. Shortly after we were married, the Love All Clan came out of the uh wilderness after I think 20 years out of fellowship and were coming to the fellowshipping with us in Prescott and actually we baptized there Tracy Kelly and Monica at little church in Prescott. So we became very inseparable friends with the Lovealls and and they were here and very very precious to us also. Brother Ron and Sister Sandy were old friends. Uh if we go way way way back when brother Ron was a young man that's a long time ago and uh brother Floyd Patterson was sending young men down to the uh church in Prescott to minister for us and brother Ron was one of those frequent flyers and brother Dennis McGary and those were very special times in our lives then also as I was a teenager you'd have been 25 probably just a young guy. Um, and then I think every young married couple in here has probably uh spent part of their youth at our place there at the ranch. And uh we consider them some of our dearest friends. Uh and even don't want to leave out Austin Dub here. He's not a young married, but he's like one of our kids. He's been very precious to us. Justice is married now. I'm available if you need an alleer to find you a bride. I can do it. You just deput deputize me, Austin. I can do that. So, God bless you each one. Brother George Moore has moved to our area to pastor the church there. And it's going to be an uphill pull and they're going to need lots of support, encouragement. I feel like that Elizabeth and I need to be there and just to support and encourage and help put our shoulder to the wheel there also. So we'll miss you. We sure love each one of you. I know that the scripture says this is something I can always if the devil tries to tell me I'm not a disciple of Christ. Scripture says by this will all men know that you're my disciple when you have love one for another. And I know that I love the brethren. So the devil can't ever tell me on that front that I'm not a child of God. So, on a lighter note, 2022 when we started driving down here twice a week is when they started the big project on I17. And I mean, I'm sure you've all been up that. It was just a zoo. Now, we're going back to the local church and they've just finished the whole big project there. So, alls I can say is it's really nice now for you to come visit us. The road's really nice and done and flex lanes and so come see us. We'll be back to visit you. God bless your hearts. We love you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've enjoyed the Wallace family for their time while they've been here. And so, he's feels led of the Lord to go up there and and help out, put the shoulder to the wheel. So, we pray that God will richly bless them. We have um all of our school children are starting school here soon. So, what I would like to do is if all of the school children, if you are going to school and you're starting here soon or perhaps you've already just started, I don't know, depending on what school district, if I could get you to come up here, I want to pray over all of our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a hour that we live in right now. And if there's ever a time that we pray over our &gt;&gt; children, &gt;&gt; for God to watch over them and keep them. Yes. Just come on up here. My my That's a church in itself right there. Right there. Look at that. Wow. All the tall ones you stand in the back there so the little ones can be seen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you come up here and Yeah. Let's just so we can all see you. Yeah. Yeah. Get there. You guys come up here a little bit forward. You stand right here. Come here. Come on up here. Come up here closer. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at this group. Yeah, keep coming. Make room, you guys. Come forward a little bit. That's it. God bless you. Amen. What a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we have as parents. The Bible says to raise up the children &gt;&gt; and the admonition and nurture of the Lord &gt;&gt; that when they grow up even if they shall stray they cannot stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is our responsibility that we raise them up. We preach to them and tell them truth and we ask God to watch over them because you know what you children you're in the toughest time of school because you're in a time now when the teachers are teaching things that uh you know uh just that are so far leaning away from what we believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that's extremely hard because now I have such little time with you, just a couple hours each week to help you keep balanced. Remember that the Satan used the channel of reasoning in the Garden of Eden and he is also known as the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; So you go to school and you're eating of knowledge. That's good. It's good to learn to read and to write, but what we must do with all of our reading and writing and all of the learning that you get in school, we must have that balance. Otherwise, if we lose our balance and you get equilibrium, which you have a problem with your equilibrium and you get dizzy and you can't walk straight. That's what happens when we're not well balanced. So, God, help us. as the ministry here. And we're not talking about just the ministry behind the pulpit. We're talking about the pulpit at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're talking about responsibility because I need your help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; That all of you will do your due diligence at home and teach your children &gt;&gt; because what an hour that we live in. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Where it is the darkest of all hours. We're in these these young children here. Oh God, &gt;&gt; I pray that he will keep his hand of blessing &gt;&gt; upon each one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch over and keep them. And so I'm going to pray over all of you right now. And I want you all as parents and as loved ones and just part of this congregation. I would like you to put your antenna up &gt;&gt; and be directing your prayers this direction &gt;&gt; and pardon me if I turn my back to you but that I turn towards them because I want to pray over them. So if you would let's just all pray you all young people bow your heads close your eyes. Heavenly Father, Lord, as pastor of this church and of this flock, this assembly that you have made us overseer. And Father, what a responsibility we have not only as the ministry at this church, but as a as a father in the gospel. Oh God, I look at these young people. And Father, I pray that you will watch over them and keep them. You did not isolate your disciples from the world, but you did insulate. You said, "I send you out as sheep among wolves." &gt;&gt; Father God, these two, these children are going to be going to school. They're going going to be learning, eating from the tree of knowledge. I pray, oh God, that you will help them to always have a balance of the gospel &gt;&gt; and of learning from education. &gt;&gt; So, Father, I pray a special blessing upon each one of them. watch over them and keep them, oh God, &gt;&gt; because Father, without your help, &gt;&gt; Father, none of us would make it. &gt;&gt; So, we're asking the grace of God once again &gt;&gt; to come down, be their portion, &gt;&gt; watch over them, Father, &gt;&gt; and keep them. Let the parents use wisdom at home. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; When they're sitting around the table or they're on family vacation or they're doing something with their children, may they always remind them of your ways because your ways are above our ways and your thoughts are above our thoughts. So, Father, I pray over these &gt;&gt; young people, &gt;&gt; the congregation, if you should tar &gt;&gt; another decade, we don't know, Lord. We believe you're coming soon, &gt;&gt; but if you should terry, these are the church of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So, Father, I pray. &gt;&gt; I bless them. &gt;&gt; I raise my hands over them right now and I say, "Oh, God, keep them father in the center of thy perfect will &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may go back and have your seats now. God bless you. Thank you young people. Amen. Amen. Yes. What a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Last night about 1:30 in the morning, I woke up very suddenly. I got out of bed. I sat on the chair in the corner of our bedroom there and I just sat and prayed and meditated on the things of God. &gt;&gt; And I just was going over things and I'm praying and praying for the church and praying for guidance. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit would just take this this little assembly that we have here and draw us closer to him. &gt;&gt; Bring us back together. around his word &gt;&gt; to not just talk about it &gt;&gt; but to get into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we might &gt;&gt; partake of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that it might manifest in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "Be not a forgetful hearer." &gt;&gt; It's not coming here to church and just hearing and getting knowledge. Let us go beyond knowledge.

[Music] It's for me a privilege to be here this morning &gt;&gt; in the church of brother Ron. &gt;&gt; I'd been here I believe is in 2022. And I was here in this church &gt;&gt; and I wanted to visit the Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; I went up there as well as to Sabino Canyon &gt;&gt; and I wanted to make sure that these places are real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And afterwards I came here &gt;&gt; and they really are befriended with brother Ron [Music] &gt;&gt; and he had come to our place many times &gt;&gt; over there in DRC. And ever since we've remained friends yet again today, it's a privilege for me &gt;&gt; and that he grants me the opportunity to speak behind his pulpit. I'm bringing greetings from the brethrens over there in DRC. &gt;&gt; They greet you all in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; They have greet you in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you accept? &gt;&gt; Do you accept? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay.

They are your brothers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One of these days the limitation of languages is going to be ending. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. I was reading brother Brennham being asked what language are we going to have over there in the millennium &gt;&gt; and he told them it's not going to be English &gt;&gt; and it's not even going to be American &gt;&gt; but God's going to give us a celestial language And in that language, everybody going to be able to listen to what everybody says. &gt;&gt; So may the Lord be blessed for that. &gt;&gt; And for me this morning, I have a small exhortation. &gt;&gt; I'd already preached to you a little bit. &gt;&gt; And I understand this church here. And today I thought that I'm not just going to repeat myself but give a small and little exhortation &gt;&gt; as we stand we can greet each other and read the scriptures. &gt;&gt; You can greet each other &gt;&gt; as we are going to start reading the word. We are in revival, &gt;&gt; the revival of the seven thunders, &gt;&gt; the revival of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are indeed in a revival &gt;&gt; and Christianity is a firm warm handshake. I've seen that it was a little bit lukewarm, but &gt;&gt; Christianity it's aime &gt;&gt; it's a firm warm handshake. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. We're going to go towards the word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read in two places. The first one's going to be in Ephesians chapter one. [Music] &gt;&gt; The third verse all the way to the eighth verse. &gt;&gt; The second scripture is going to be in the book of Romans. Roman 8 verse 19. &gt;&gt; Let's start with Ephesians chapter 1. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read gladly and be as glad as I'm reading it. &gt;&gt; And I believe everybody has brought their Bibles. [Music] whether it's a digital or is it is the book. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon mentioned that we have to bring our Bibles as we go to church. Yes, sir. Let's read. We have their Bibles. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; All right. Excellent. &gt;&gt; We're going to be doing reading. from verse three. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. according as he has chosen us in his in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ. [Music] to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the praise of the glory of his grace, [Music] &gt;&gt; wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his blood. the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. wisdom and prudence, &gt;&gt; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, &gt;&gt; according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That in the dispensation of the full in the fullness of time, skeletons. &gt;&gt; You might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And our second scriptures is in the book of Romans, &gt;&gt; chapter 8. &gt;&gt; We're only going to read uh one verse, verse 19. &gt;&gt; Okay. [Music] For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Father God, &gt;&gt; we're coming in be beholding your face &gt;&gt; with your people this morning. so we can all sit together around the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say that men shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but of every word that comes out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; And the mouthpiece of God is a prophet. Oh God, in this hour you have sent us a great prophet. It is this great prophet Elijah of Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; the prophet William Marian Brham &gt;&gt; with the words with the shout of thunders with the revealing of the seals. So you can so to call out this bride that is without spot. &gt;&gt; Bless us Lord &gt;&gt; in the re the scriptures that we have readiritual. &gt;&gt; Lord open our understanding spiritual and bless your people. &gt;&gt; And Lord we thank you for brother Ron that has given us his pulpit. And we're praying God that if somebody's sick may be healed [Music] and if somebody is in need that you may provide to that very need. May you come amongst us through the ministering of the word &gt;&gt; for your children have driven long distances. but they really needed the word of God. May you bless them. &gt;&gt; May you bring the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and the great physician of God that he may come and just bless us. God now bless the reading of the word in our hearts &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't know what I may read but you know the need of your people. &gt;&gt; May you bless them Lord for the glory of God &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I like put as script as a title. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what the the pastor told me. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. You told me that afterwards &gt;&gt; he was going to sit down next to the sister. So I like to give a title [Music] the great mystery of adoption &gt;&gt; and the manifestation of sons of God and it's on those titles I'm going to speak a little bit &gt;&gt; even if I do not finish &gt;&gt; the brother pastor is going to continue &gt;&gt; and he's a great doctor of God. So this morning my title is &gt;&gt; the great mystery of adoption &gt;&gt; and the manifestation of sons of God. &gt;&gt; So God God has called us to this message. Amen. [Music] And he has called us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. And this purpose is to adopt us and to grant us over there in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in every ages. And God was calling out a church &gt;&gt; and a church of good quality, &gt;&gt; a church without spot nor wrinkle. &gt;&gt; And that church is you guys here. It's us over here. Wait. So we must be that church over there &gt;&gt; because time is running outens [Music] and brother says we are at the dispensation of the fullness of time. Okay. &gt;&gt; And this is the dispensation where we and we find ourselves in. So that this may help you where I'm going towards. &gt;&gt; And the church where we in is not a church that we have created. &gt;&gt; It's a church that has been there since Pentecost. [Music] And that trail has started over there in the upper room [Music] when God had given the Holy Spirit to the apostles and the remainder that was over there. &gt;&gt; May you say amen to that. Amen. And is then that the church had started, &gt;&gt; the church that we are, &gt;&gt; the church that you are, &gt;&gt; the church that is right here amongst us, &gt;&gt; Phoenix &gt;&gt; here in Phoenix, &gt;&gt; that church that started back there over there in the upper room when God had given the Holy Spirit to the apostles. May you say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; May you say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; So since then the church had started and when Paul came as a messenger of the age of Ephesus, the church had already fallen. It was fallen because of the choosing of the deacons. They had done then they had chosen Nicholas from Antioch. They came with his own thinking and the spirit of the devil had come into the church and already then the church had fallen. But Abraham said that the messenger comes at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; The messenger never came in the beginning of the age. &gt;&gt; He comes at the end of the age and it brings correction within that age and Paul came and we can see then there it was the church of Ephesus. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; From 53 to 70, &gt;&gt; from then it was the church of Ephesus. &gt;&gt; And God has sent his word and gathered all the elected and they believe that word then. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God had sealed them. and place them aside. &gt;&gt; And afterwards it was rain and it was from 70 to 312. &gt;&gt; And the messenger was given, Amen. &gt;&gt; had called out people and God had sealed them. and bless them aside. &gt;&gt; I'd love for you guys to understand &gt;&gt; that God is forming his church by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when the Lord Jesus Christ had come, &gt;&gt; the Jews had rejected him which was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; So God had placed them in the feast of trumpet and the trumpet only brings difficulties, war and and wars. &gt;&gt; But as the Gentiles We had believed that he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; God was very pleased. &gt;&gt; And he's put us on the feast of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; So the the the the feast of the Holy Spirit. So he continued to give us the Holy Spirit since the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. You say amen. &gt;&gt; So the church of the Gentiles has been formed by the Holy Spirit. You cannot be in that very church without the Holy Spirit. Can you say amen to that? After Ranius, it was it was Martin from tour [Music] &gt;&gt; and Martin preached &gt;&gt; from 312 I believe to 606 and those that believed the elected God had sealed them and then put them aside as well. And then God has sent Columbus. &gt;&gt; It was the year of Thai Tower. In that age, &gt;&gt; God has sent a message. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that message had to go from 606 from uh 1520 &gt;&gt; to 1520. And those that believe in that very age, God has sealed them and put them aside, placed them aside &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. Of course, &gt;&gt; do you understand? &gt;&gt; God had sealed them by the Holy Spirit because God calls this church with the word and sealed them with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And now The church had already fallen over then the Nia council &gt;&gt; with the Catholic church and a lot a lot of thing that was just not good. [Music] &gt;&gt; God had to rise once again his church and reform his church. &gt;&gt; Restore his church. Amen. restoration. &gt;&gt; So he restored his church. &gt;&gt; You say amen. You &gt;&gt; may say amen. &gt;&gt; Now when God had given the message to Luther, &gt;&gt; it was a message of justification. So the people that was receiving the message of Luther &gt;&gt; there to go all the way to sanctification and then they stopped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justification &gt;&gt; justification and they stopped &gt;&gt; and stop over there. &gt;&gt; They were predestinated to go all the way up until justification. Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And now &gt;&gt; and God has sent John Wesley. &gt;&gt; It was from uh &gt;&gt; uh 17 uh when was John Wesley. &gt;&gt; John Wesley. &gt;&gt; Yes. He came after Martin Luther &gt;&gt; and his age was from 1750 to 1906 &gt;&gt; and God had given a message to John Wesley &gt;&gt; and the message of John Wesley and for those people there &gt;&gt; and there to go all the up until sanctification and stopped there. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; And it stopped over there. &gt;&gt; They just couldn't go beyond that. &gt;&gt; Luther had already given justification. &gt;&gt; They had stopped there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Johnesley. &gt;&gt; After John Wesley, &gt;&gt; God sent a message to the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Who is listening? &gt;&gt; Who is following? &gt;&gt; Who is following? &gt;&gt; May you raise your hand? I'm going to see. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Now God has sent a message to the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then &gt;&gt; those that the message was given to bring the people all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the restoration of the gifts. And when they go all the way there, they stopped. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; They just said to stop right then and there. &gt;&gt; But another time to come afterwards. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A time to come afterward. &gt;&gt; It was the time of William Random. &gt;&gt; It is our time indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is our time. It is our age. &gt;&gt; It is the age of William Random. &gt;&gt; It is the age of the bride. &gt;&gt; I believe that you are the bride. &gt;&gt; Are you the bride? &gt;&gt; Are you the bride? &gt;&gt; Are you the bride? &gt;&gt; Are you the bride? &gt;&gt; Are you the bride? &gt;&gt; Yes, we are the bride. We're not Pentecostals. Abraham says that we are beyond Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God called Luther &gt;&gt; and gave him a message of justification. &gt;&gt; The justification &gt;&gt; of justification. He called Wesley and gave him a message of sanctification. And when it was time for the Ponte coastal, all this Ponte coastal that you see over there, [Music] they had given them a message. But that message had only got to come all the way to the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and the gifts, the speaking in tongues, the healing of the sick, all these gifts there. It was a message with the restoration of the gifts. Can &gt;&gt; we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Now when William Brandham comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are beyond 1906. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he comes with a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was born, he was born under the the the the under the pillar of fire. The pillar of fire was inside the house around 4 in the morning. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was uh was being born and it was showing that with him the Messiah was going to come on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now when it was over there in the river Ohio, In 33 then his ministry started angels came down. Do you say amen and told him &gt;&gt; as John the Baptist was sent &gt;&gt; with a message as a forerunner &gt;&gt; on my first coming &gt;&gt; year as well. I'll give you a message &gt;&gt; to become the forerunner &gt;&gt; of my second coming &gt;&gt; and in the formation the formation's rooms God had given him the vision seven vision all the way to the end of the world but I'm not going to talk about that But I'm going to speak about us that has been called with the message of William Brennham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So us are not like the Lutheran Methodist. &gt;&gt; We're not like the Methodists. We are not like the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You may shake each other's hands and we are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are the bride. You may do it. You may do it. Is it hard to shake each other's hands? We are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Abraham says, &gt;&gt; "We are not Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; We are not in the age of less. We are beyond Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We are beyond Pentecost. We are way beyond Pentecost. &gt;&gt; But what is God asking from us? &gt;&gt; He had required justification with the Lutheran. &gt;&gt; He had been required sanctification with the Methodists. It had been required the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We're the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; But us, what is God requiring us? &gt;&gt; What is he asking us? &gt;&gt; Us, God is asking to go &gt;&gt; all the way to adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to be adopted. We don't have just a regular baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to demonstrate. But &gt;&gt; we have to go beyond the adoption. Now, if we go back to the epistle of Paul, well, the epistle of uh &gt;&gt; Paul, &gt;&gt; if we go back to Paul &gt;&gt; in Ephesians &gt;&gt; chapter one, &gt;&gt; Paul says that God has chosen us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; God had elected us before the foundation of the world. Can &gt;&gt; you say amen? That's when he had elected us. &gt;&gt; But we have been predestinated &gt;&gt; to become the sons of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what it says. &gt;&gt; We're not like the others. &gt;&gt; We have been predestinated &gt;&gt; to become his sons of adoption. Do you have anybody that can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm What does uh what does it say? I'm going to read a little bit that I can. What is adoption? &gt;&gt; What is adoption? &gt;&gt; Because God must adopt us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God must adopt us. For us is not just a simple Holy Spirit for us is not just a simple sanctification that he gives. For us is just not sanctification that he gives. It is not just a simple Holy Spirit that he gives. &gt;&gt; Excuse me to use the word simple &gt;&gt; but is the truth. God, him. He calls us &gt;&gt; to go beyond and all the way to adoption. &gt;&gt; Because Paul says, &gt;&gt; being predestinated to become his children of adoption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had predestinated us to be his children of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has elected us first us &gt;&gt; because we're at the end of the gospel. We are the end of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is the closure of the gospel. &gt;&gt; There is not going to be another messenger coming afterwards. There's not going to be another message to come. There's nothing that's going to come afterwards. One of says that we are the last ones. They're seeing the history of the world coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have seen all the promises being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the promises of the American pope &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have seen now Madam Aris was uh dressed &gt;&gt; the the the day of of the the inauguration and she was wearing purple. It is the truth. &gt;&gt; But Abraham was a prophet. It can say nothing more but just just the truth. &gt;&gt; And when you look, &gt;&gt; the way that she was dressed, &gt;&gt; the lady was dressed in purple. He really prophesied upon California, even Los Angeles, that Los Angeles was going to sink in. &gt;&gt; We believe that that is the truth. Brother can only say the truth. If we are here this morning is because of brother said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. As we see, we see that the world is going to come to an end and there's not going to be another messenger afterwards. There is not going to be another one. Nobody's going to come be after us. Brother Brandham is the messenger to bring the church into the rapture in the rapture that is coming. It is the messenger that he's going to do. As you say amen to that, &gt;&gt; as you are seated here in this building, in this church of brother Ron &gt;&gt; with the messenger, brother Brandham, if there is an heaven, you're going to make it there. If there is a God, you you are going to see him. You are going to see that very God because this is a true message that has been given. &gt;&gt; It's a message that is bringing us into the rapture in the changement or the change of the body in the adoption. Abraham said that the fullness of adoption, &gt;&gt; it is the changing of the body. &gt;&gt; It is the changing of the body. &gt;&gt; But God with the word and the message and the opening of the seal, the third pool. [Music] &gt;&gt; It gives us adoption. So the Pentecostal cannot receive adoption. Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; The Methodist neither. &gt;&gt; The Lutheran cannot. &gt;&gt; All the others cannot &gt;&gt; but us because of the opening of the seals because the opening of the seals brings Jesus on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The opening of the seals brings Jesus down on earth. And Jesus it is the perfection. &gt;&gt; And Paul has said in Hebrews 11 &gt;&gt; without us &gt;&gt; the others &gt;&gt; since Paul in the Old Testament even they couldn't come all the way to perfection without us. &gt;&gt; Abraham had to come. The cloud had to come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The cloud had to come down. &gt;&gt; The cloud is right here at your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's way far from the Congo, but it's very close from me here in Arizona. The cloud came down in Sen Mountain. &gt;&gt; I went there and I've realized it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all that coming down and as descension of the fullness of the word &gt;&gt; is leading us to adoption. Resurrection &gt;&gt; is leading us to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that you will say amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go fast now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is asking for us, requiring us to go all the way to adoption. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? Amen. &gt;&gt; But to go all the way to adoption, &gt;&gt; it goes to a certain order. &gt;&gt; Justification, &gt;&gt; justification, &gt;&gt; sanctification, &gt;&gt; sanctification, &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit and then there you are children. &gt;&gt; So Pentecostal just babies &gt;&gt; but we are not babies. No, &gt;&gt; we have to climb up the pyramid &gt;&gt; from faith, add virtue and &gt;&gt; to add knowledge and from to longsuffering &gt;&gt; and longsuffering patience and patient to add &gt;&gt; and from uh &gt;&gt; what is &gt;&gt; goodness. good, godliness, &gt;&gt; and from there are the uh brotherly &gt;&gt; brotherly love. &gt;&gt; And at that point, we're going to have perfection. &gt;&gt; Oh, the the headstone. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the headstone &gt;&gt; is going to crown the the pyramid of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then You are sealed. &gt;&gt; Adopted. &gt;&gt; You are adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; you must first have a birth. And when you're born, &gt;&gt; you're starting to from faith. You add virtue from virtue, &gt;&gt; knowledge, knowledge, &gt;&gt; temperance, temperance, &gt;&gt; patience, patience, &gt;&gt; godliness from godliness, brotherly love and then the headstone come to crown the pyramid. Abraham says, "God called his church the same way that he calls his children." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The headstone, &gt;&gt; the seven thunders crown the pyramid &gt;&gt; of the imperfect ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes to crown &gt;&gt; your life &gt;&gt; and then he adopts you &gt;&gt; allow me to read something here. How is this church that we have? Because when you're in the church, you got to understand what kind of church you're in. &gt;&gt; What is God requiring for that church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can read. It is condemnation by representation. &gt;&gt; It is uh 1960 November 13th. &gt;&gt; November. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'm going to start little by little my subject and I'm going to stop. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. We can read &gt;&gt; is going to be uh 1960 November 13th paragraph 60. &gt;&gt; It says there [Music] And we believe there must be a church in these last days religion &gt;&gt; rather it's a it's a hybrid religion 1960 1960 and we believe [Music] that there should be a church in these last days. that we'll receive &gt;&gt; both the former and the latter reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will scatter throughout the world. In this Laudian church, in this Leician age, &gt;&gt; it will be a church &gt;&gt; that is called back &gt;&gt; the original faith in God. It will be a church &gt;&gt; that'll have Jesus Christ walking in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll have Jesus Christ walking in it manifest &gt;&gt; manifesting himself. [Music] &gt;&gt; The shout of the king &gt;&gt; will be in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The shout of the king &gt;&gt; shall be in it. &gt;&gt; So in this right here, there's the shout of the king. &gt;&gt; There's the shout of the king. &gt;&gt; What is that shout? But when explain the mystery of the rapture, &gt;&gt; the Lord himself shall come down, descend &gt;&gt; with a shout &gt;&gt; with a voice and the sound of the trumpet, &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ shall rise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to talk about the shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. The shout, &gt;&gt; the shout &gt;&gt; he comes down, descend with a shout, with the voice &gt;&gt; and the sound of trumpets. &gt;&gt; And the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then I that remain. We're going to be changed and uh and gathered with those that were dead. to go to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; So the shout is this message said that the shout &gt;&gt; it is the message that gathers the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we say this message here, in the tapes, &gt;&gt; in the books, &gt;&gt; in the applications, in the internet, &gt;&gt; it is the shout. &gt;&gt; That's the shout that gathers that gathers the the bride, &gt;&gt; the bride that you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are that very bride. You are here because of the shout &gt;&gt; there's the reason why you're God of the year &gt;&gt; and that very shout &gt;&gt; it is the time for to prepare the soul lamping time. &gt;&gt; It is the time to trim our lamps. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It is the very lamp. It is that very shell that we have. &gt;&gt; We are the true virgins. We are not the foolish ones. &gt;&gt; We are the true one. The true virgins. &gt;&gt; We are the true virgins. &gt;&gt; We are not foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; We have taken our lamps. &gt;&gt; And there is oil in that very lamp. &gt;&gt; We have oil in the lamp. &gt;&gt; And the oil is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Paul said, &gt;&gt; "If someone doesn't have the spirit of Christ, &gt;&gt; it doesn't belong to him. &gt;&gt; But you have the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother, you have the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother, you have the spirit of Christ. Sister, you have the spirit of Christ. Sister, you have the spirit of Christ. You belong to him. You are his children. And it's by that spirit that it births us. &gt;&gt; By his spirit that he births us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has birthed as our mothers have birthed us. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God has birthed us. Yes. I would like to read now we're going to go fast as the timing is going towards the end. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read adoption what it is. &gt;&gt; Quickly here. No. Okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Brother says yeah brother said brother Ron said that if we can't find if we can just translate directly here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. I am uh teaching to people that already been taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, who can doubt about it? &gt;&gt; This is what Paul said. &gt;&gt; It is a scripture of Paul. &gt;&gt; It is the scripture of Paul. &gt;&gt; This is what he has taught the church. &gt;&gt; Placing her in her position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church that we have, &gt;&gt; it is a church that has been placed. &gt;&gt; Everybody have their place. &gt;&gt; Brother, you have your place. &gt;&gt; You have your place. &gt;&gt; You have your place. &gt;&gt; You have your place. &gt;&gt; You have your place. &gt;&gt; Because our age, &gt;&gt; it is the age of placing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may say amen to that. &gt;&gt; It says that the book of Ephesians &gt;&gt; is like the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; Okay. Why? Because those people &gt;&gt; Paul Moses has taken them out of Egypt. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; So when they had did the Exodus, &gt;&gt; he circumcised them &gt;&gt; and the cross read the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Moses m the rock &gt;&gt; and they were moving forward. Remember that day. They remember that Moses circumcised them &gt;&gt; when they came out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; I love when you guys say amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I love what you you say amen. &gt;&gt; So when they walk in in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; circumcised, &gt;&gt; baptized with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Miriam had taken the the the tempering and they danced &gt;&gt; and they saw their enemies sunk in the sea. &gt;&gt; But what happened afterwards? &gt;&gt; Moses did a lot of miracles. Can you say amen? The pillow fire and the cloud was with them. They ate the mana coming down from heaven &gt;&gt; and they they ate the the birds. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; There were unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There was Kora and Din &gt;&gt; and Abram. They were against Moses. &gt;&gt; But they were already circumcised. &gt;&gt; Are you remembering that? &gt;&gt; They were already circumcised. &gt;&gt; They were going to the land. &gt;&gt; They were in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; But they all died at Kadesh. &gt;&gt; They all died in Kadesh. But when Joshua comes &gt;&gt; with a new ministry, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses has crossed them through a miracle. &gt;&gt; But Joshua him crossed them with the word with the ark of the Lord. [Music] So the the older &gt;&gt; the Levites &gt;&gt; and continue marching towards Jordan. &gt;&gt; You got to really pay attention. &gt;&gt; Joshua also circumcised them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes. Circumcised them. &gt;&gt; Even though they were already circumcised by Moses. But when they come to the Jordan, &gt;&gt; Joshua circumcised them once more. &gt;&gt; Because there and then they have to cross to go in the land. He circumcised him once more. He does it once more. He He had circumcised him once more. &gt;&gt; I would rather speak in English. It would have been uh so you can see before it crossed into the land. &gt;&gt; But it didn't they didn't cross with miracles. Then &gt;&gt; the Levite had the ark. &gt;&gt; And when they put one foot on water, the Jordan parted and the cross. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had circumcised them &gt;&gt; for the second time. And they are crossing by the word &gt;&gt; and now it is in the land of the promise &gt;&gt; and there he places them. &gt;&gt; That is the placing. &gt;&gt; So Benjamin is here. &gt;&gt; Dan is right here. &gt;&gt; Zabulon is right here. &gt;&gt; Reuben is here. &gt;&gt; Reuben is here. every one of them there. &gt;&gt; He was placing each and every one of them in their respective places. &gt;&gt; After the second circumcision, &gt;&gt; you have anybody that can say amen to that. Amen. Brother says that real lesson we're giving them with types. &gt;&gt; Yes. the thorough lesson. We have to give them with types. &gt;&gt; So as we see the children of Israel coming, &gt;&gt; Moses had circumcised them. &gt;&gt; They across the Red Sea in the desertion with that circumcision. &gt;&gt; They couldn't hold &gt;&gt; they started just uh messing with Moses. Amen. You say amen. &gt;&gt; And now all of them died &gt;&gt; in Kades. &gt;&gt; They needed a new ministry. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There there was a need for a new ministry. &gt;&gt; It is the ministry of Joshua. &gt;&gt; That is to put them into the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. with that very ministry once more circumcised them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now they can enter the land. When they enter the land, &gt;&gt; now it's not for that one to be over there and go wherever they will their mother when they were born. That's right. They had pronounced the name of the place where they were supposed to be &gt;&gt; Zabulon. You near the sea. &gt;&gt; God. God &gt;&gt; some place there. &gt;&gt; And every one of them. I believe that you remember &gt;&gt; the prophecy of his Isaiah &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to the land of Zebulun &gt;&gt; after the death of John the Baptist and he said that the prophecy of of Isaiah had been fulfilled &gt;&gt; land of Zeon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Galile and Galileo of the Gentiles &gt;&gt; and the people that were sitting in darkness &gt;&gt; and saw a great light &gt;&gt; and Jesus was that very light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this very hour &gt;&gt; we have that we also have that light. &gt;&gt; It is with William Random. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In the evening time &gt;&gt; there shall be light. &gt;&gt; In the evening time there will be a day. &gt;&gt; There there will be no nor day nor night. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; but in the evening time &gt;&gt; there shall be light. The message of Methodist of Wesley Pentecostal day &gt;&gt; it was a twilight day was neither day or night. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. But when we come here with the message of William Brandham, &gt;&gt; it is the light &gt;&gt; that is light. &gt;&gt; That is light. &gt;&gt; Is light that have been turned on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The others have stayed in just the the luring, but it wasn't the message. I'm not sure if you're going to say amen to this. But what you must so really understand and then what I'm going to explain, but because now &gt;&gt; I'm talking about adoption. &gt;&gt; It's going to allow me to stop here somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We as well &gt;&gt; they have received how many baptism? &gt;&gt; How many circumcisions? &gt;&gt; Two. &gt;&gt; The first one with Moses &gt;&gt; to cross the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; And the second one &gt;&gt; by Joshua. And they've been able to cross the Jordan &gt;&gt; and there everybody were there at their places. &gt;&gt; This apostle, &gt;&gt; you are apostle. &gt;&gt; They put you at your place. &gt;&gt; You are a doctor. &gt;&gt; You're at your place. &gt;&gt; That is the message of placing. The messenger brother Brenham &gt;&gt; who understands that &gt;&gt; who understood that &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; I am careful of time and I believe you have understood &gt;&gt; it is like us as well &gt;&gt; when we come into the message of William Renham If I had a board, I could have drawn it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you come in the message, William Brandham, &gt;&gt; follow carefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. You confess all your sins from your birth all the way to that very baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May somewhere say amen to that. &gt;&gt; And when you were repented and they baptized you and you believe this message William Brandham, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the message William Brandham. I'm not talking about the Pentecostal message. I'm a pastor in the church. There was a brother did a lot of years and said, "Bro, brother Freddy, I've been baptized over there. I believe it was the Catholics or something like that." I said, "No, no, no. You have to be baptized by this message." &gt;&gt; Amen. You must be baptized in this message &gt;&gt; so that you may receive &gt;&gt; the real salvation. &gt;&gt; Now when you when you were baptized, &gt;&gt; you are justified. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you say amen? &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I haven't heard. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother one baptized you &gt;&gt; at the river and &gt;&gt; you are justified. &gt;&gt; But you have come right. It must be that you go forward. So you can I arrive at the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; First sanctification. &gt;&gt; God must sanctify you. The Bible says &gt;&gt; seek sanctification &gt;&gt; which without which nobody will see God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ram says that when somebody is justified He still left the roots of sin. &gt;&gt; If you go to Hebrews chapter 10, chapter chapter 10 verse 2 and three, &gt;&gt; Paul calls it the desire to sin. Now calls it the roots of sins. So it's still there in your soul. Have you listened? Have you understood? &gt;&gt; Somebody that been justified, he still have a poor habit. &gt;&gt; No, I'm going to teach you as a pastor. &gt;&gt; Not like a doctor. Just like a pastor. &gt;&gt; If you understood. So you are justified after the baptism and God forgot all of the sin. But the roots of sin are still in your heart. You got to ask how is he going to be removed? Brother says &gt;&gt; is going to be removed. When you're going to come at the altar &gt;&gt; and look at your own soul, &gt;&gt; all the lies, &gt;&gt; all the criticism, &gt;&gt; all the bad things, &gt;&gt; the bad hearts, &gt;&gt; the just uh indifferences, all of those things remain over there in your heart. And you go near, &gt;&gt; you go there a bar and at where I live, the the bar is just next to our road. And you can smell the the smell of uh of alcohol. &gt;&gt; And if I could drink, it would have been nice. &gt;&gt; It's still in your heart. Who can may say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You still want to fight. &gt;&gt; You want to fight against your wife. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The bad habits are still in your heart. &gt;&gt; In your heart. &gt;&gt; I'm indicating there because brother says um In the heart there is an empty place. &gt;&gt; In that very place there there is your soul. And if somebody dies and he has 73 kg, &gt;&gt; we're going to find after his death he will be with 72 kilos. It means that difference there of 1 kilo. &gt;&gt; But you have to work on your soul. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Over there. Have you understood? &gt;&gt; Have you understood? Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you understood? &gt;&gt; I'm not really listening. I'm not hearing. &gt;&gt; Have you understood back there? Back there. Somebody has been justified. You still have some bad habits. &gt;&gt; You just indifferences, a bad heart and adultery thoughts. He still can steal. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; it's very important. &gt;&gt; You say amen. Is that &gt;&gt; excuse me, children? Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I I've seen that they pray for the kids. I'm adding my prayer to the kids as well. &gt;&gt; Well, yes. &gt;&gt; I love that God blesses you. But sometime the children love to lie a lot. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Children love to lie. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, you have to stay there. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; lies. Lord, &gt;&gt; the better hearts. Lord &gt;&gt; indifferences brother says now brother Bam said that is the the the work of the heart. &gt;&gt; No no the soul &gt;&gt; the soul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait. You got to be there until the old man dies. &gt;&gt; You got to set the altar until the old man dies. Amen. Rather run build this church so they can come and pray. &gt;&gt; You may come here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't always stay home. &gt;&gt; No, you're here until the old man dies. My my &gt;&gt; the old man, &gt;&gt; right? the the old lady &gt;&gt; that was just answering in all kinds of ways must die &gt;&gt; at the altar. &gt;&gt; Have you understood? Have you understood? Who understood? &gt;&gt; The old man must stay there. The intellect all the other things got to stay there. And then when you're really sanctified &gt;&gt; is then that you may ask the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and he comes down &gt;&gt; and he baptizes you. &gt;&gt; It is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It is the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But &gt;&gt; when you're born again, &gt;&gt; you are just a son &gt;&gt; baby. &gt;&gt; Have you understood? &gt;&gt; But us and that's where the Ponteosal had to stop. &gt;&gt; When we were born again, &gt;&gt; we start running. And to faith we add virtue. We keep on climbing up the pyramid to virtue, knowledge, knowledge, temperance, temperance. &gt;&gt; It is, godliness and then brotherly love. Then &gt;&gt; the stone comes and crowns &gt;&gt; the pyramid of your life. &gt;&gt; A barb says, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, &gt;&gt; "One of the mysteries that have been revealed &gt;&gt; by the seals, &gt;&gt; it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without any sensations, feelings. &gt;&gt; But the fullness of the person of Christ &gt;&gt; must also dwell in you." &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen." You say amen. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So you see when you reach the top of the pyramid said that it was not required of those people those people of Paul of Irene all these other people the people of Luther of Wesley all these other people the Pentecostals they were never required what has been required of us for us, &gt;&gt; we must reach all the way to the top of the pyramid &gt;&gt; and there we are adopted. &gt;&gt; But Ram says &gt;&gt; it is the real baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen? &gt;&gt; You see we have had the Holy Spirit here. You see the first circumcision but when we come at the end of the pyramid we receive a second circumcision. &gt;&gt; Now for that very one I have to read so that I may not say brother said yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We're going to go fast over here. I'm going to go fast so you can go and dwell. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand how a man comes to adoption. &gt;&gt; I think it's here. No, no. No, no, no, no. Okay. And the quickly please. &gt;&gt; It's really quickly. 62 uh October 14th &gt;&gt; 341 &gt;&gt; these fellows wasn't required what these fellows are &gt;&gt; this wasn't required what this was &gt;&gt; but But he brought his church up the same way. &gt;&gt; He brought his church up the same way. &gt;&gt; So there are seven things. &gt;&gt; There's faith, &gt;&gt; virtue. You see &gt;&gt; come up, &gt;&gt; knowledge, &gt;&gt; temperance, &gt;&gt; patience, &gt;&gt; godliness, &gt;&gt; brotherly love, &gt;&gt; and you add brotherly kindness and &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come come comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Then God leaves in a tabernacle &gt;&gt; called &gt;&gt; the building. the leaving a tabernacle of the living God's dwelling in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you understood that? &gt;&gt; Have you understood? &gt;&gt; It gives you the true Holy Ghost baptism though you had received a Holy Ghost back there, &gt;&gt; right? But that baptism &gt;&gt; had made sure that you grew &gt;&gt; and accumulate all of these virtues &gt;&gt; up until you reach adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother calls it in the statue of a perfect man, &gt;&gt; the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. the ceiling. &gt;&gt; Or the ceiling. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Or the ceiling. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And there you are sealed. &gt;&gt; No more &gt;&gt; and you are adopted. &gt;&gt; You are manifested. &gt;&gt; Brother was a adopted son. &gt;&gt; He was a manifested son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul says that &gt;&gt; the nature was waiting was waiting groaning. &gt;&gt; When God had created our father Adam was a god. &gt;&gt; He could walk on water. It could it could also order or command a bull. &gt;&gt; It could it could master the wind &gt;&gt; and he was obeying his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could say to the bull or the lion lion move from there &gt;&gt; and go the other way. &gt;&gt; And the lion was obedient. &gt;&gt; He could walk on water. because it was God. &gt;&gt; It was the sin that has uh disallowed him from that that power. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Did you understand? &gt;&gt; And he fell he fell into sin. Sickness came. Death came. You started fearing lion. And when the line comes, we have to bring a a gun. But brother was not asking for a gun. &gt;&gt; He said to the bull, the bull of the living God, I must go pray for a man over there. &gt;&gt; And the bull also bowed down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ground had been two great great adoption in the Bible in the church. The very first one it was the one of the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ after obedient to God he went to the mount of transfiguration &gt;&gt; with Peter, James and uh John and when he was there Moses and Elijah's work had come as well and his apparel was shining &gt;&gt; and God said this is my only son begotten son &gt;&gt; listen to him brother preach a lot on hear him adoption &gt;&gt; this is our message of adoption &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen. So brother said when God says to a man hear him when God says to a man to to a man to listen to him it means don't listen to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what he said for Jesus. Hear him. He &gt;&gt; is my beloved son. adopt. &gt;&gt; He had adopted Jesus &gt;&gt; in the mount of transfiguration. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody that can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; It was one of the great adoptions. Okay. &gt;&gt; The second one &gt;&gt; is William Brandham. &gt;&gt; William Brandham. &gt;&gt; It's William Brandham. &gt;&gt; That message is standing standing in the gap. in the message sitting in the gap said, "We're sitting in the table." &gt;&gt; And the cloud had come down &gt;&gt; and I gathering him up and and a voice said, "This is my prophet." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "This is my beloved sonet." But he said, "This is my prophet. &gt;&gt; You must hear him as well." &gt;&gt; Believe bring the people to believe you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're sincere and you bring the people to believe, not even cancer can stand against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all brother. Bring people to believe you. &gt;&gt; You got to bring the people to believe &gt;&gt; to believe you. You &gt;&gt; that they believe you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; do you see it was an adopted son? &gt;&gt; He was a manifested son. manifest. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a manifestation of the of a son of God, &gt;&gt; but he was a waving sheath, &gt;&gt; showing that we were going to come to that very maturity as well. You cannot come to adoption. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the last quotes. You cannot come to adoption &gt;&gt; without being born again. &gt;&gt; First of all, the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; First of all, the Holy Spirit. That's why the very very first thing &gt;&gt; when you come here &gt;&gt; in this very church &gt;&gt; the William Brandham &gt;&gt; of William Brandham &gt;&gt; the of brother Ron &gt;&gt; the first thing it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; if you do not have it you you can't forget about it &gt;&gt; because it is the Holy Spirit spirit that gives you a new body. &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Spirit that's going to bring you back from death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message where the Holy Ghost was given, &gt;&gt; it's only those that have the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; they're going to make it to that very rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there is others that come I I I know that here you're very gentle. But back home I speak like a pastor. Some people come to the church to sing. We sing. It's not bad to sing. It's not bad to dance. But &gt;&gt; the most essential thing, &gt;&gt; it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They had a question during times Paul's time. &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? Amen. &gt;&gt; I see that you really don't want to shake each other's hand. &gt;&gt; You're scared of COVID. [Music] We greet each other. &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? &gt;&gt; Can you shake? The person next to you? Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you received the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; since you believed? &gt;&gt; That is the question. &gt;&gt; Because when you have the Holy Spirit that you are born again, that you are then son of God and then you can start growing. But if you're a bad child, &gt;&gt; there are a really bad child. &gt;&gt; There are really bad children. &gt;&gt; And the bad children, &gt;&gt; oh my my &gt;&gt; oh my. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have a five to 10 minutes left here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, &gt;&gt; have you understood? Well, &gt;&gt; that's when you are a good &gt;&gt; son. In the Old Testament, when a son was born, &gt;&gt; so they were recruiting tutors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And professor. a professor &gt;&gt; to uh teach the son &gt;&gt; because he was doing everything by himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a son had to be born. &gt;&gt; It is you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're born again &gt;&gt; and that the tutor, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; comes and he start to teach you &gt;&gt; and he see that you're really nice son. &gt;&gt; So he text you &gt;&gt; the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That very son was his son since his birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had to manifest some good characters &gt;&gt; so that he may be adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And place him &gt;&gt; and put him at work. So the signature even on the check &gt;&gt; was as valid &gt;&gt; of the signature of the father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham was that very man. &gt;&gt; He was adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God told him, "Ask whatever you want. Tell Addie to ask whatever she wants. &gt;&gt; Why was that? &gt;&gt; Because he himself was an adopted son. &gt;&gt; It is there that all of us must reach the church of brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Do not waste any time. &gt;&gt; You got to travail. do the the traveling of the soul. &gt;&gt; Go forward. Receive the Holy Spirit. But says, &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at justification." But says, &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at sanctification." But says, &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You got to go on and move forward. &gt;&gt; You got to continue advancing.

It's not bad. &gt;&gt; But we have to have the traveling of the soul because it must travel because the soul is the one that's going to make it to heaven. &gt;&gt; There's three minutes left. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read hear him uh preach here in Phoenix, &gt;&gt; December 16th. &gt;&gt; December 13th, 1960. Maropa, &gt;&gt; I am in the valley of Maricopa where the seven thunders are being revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read that quote. It was on March 13th, 1960.

Maybe you're just a servant, a &gt;&gt; housewife. He must place you. &gt;&gt; We are here to receive &gt;&gt; the placing. &gt;&gt; Everybody at their own place. &gt;&gt; I think you have understood the two circumcisions. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have seen the two circumcisions. It's to how you can enter the land. &gt;&gt; You have something to do. &gt;&gt; You have a work to do. Okay. in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; They bring him to a certain place &gt;&gt; and there is a ceremony in front of the angels &gt;&gt; and place him in his position, &gt;&gt; meaning that he's in the body of Christ. Hello. &gt;&gt; So that person has authority. &gt;&gt; You have authority. &gt;&gt; People are suffering. &gt;&gt; People are sick. &gt;&gt; Abraham says, "Who are where are these people?" Where are these people in Lumashi? Where are these people in Lumashi? And we we got to seek them. Look for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Muslim are looking for them. &gt;&gt; Where are they? &gt;&gt; We have heard the shout. &gt;&gt; But where are these people? &gt;&gt; It's you guys here. &gt;&gt; Nature is waiting and growing. Yeah. [Music] That mean meaning is in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Allow me to say this. &gt;&gt; Even if you take me for a fanatic from here and now this very same thing is going to get fulfilled. There's going to be a power that will get in the church. It is getting into already now the Holy Spirit going to anoint the people so much that they're going to pronounce the word. &gt;&gt; It will even create &gt;&gt; even there. We haven't seen the power as such that is getting into the church now. I know that it's done. &gt;&gt; Tell this mountain. &gt;&gt; Now be moved &gt;&gt; and not doubting in your heart. &gt;&gt; But believing that what you said has happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll see it fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The placing of the church in the position the fullness of the power &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; getting into the church. &gt;&gt; So those that critic &gt;&gt; will shut their mouths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The nature was waiting. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; People were sick.

I'm waiting for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. Thank you &gt;&gt; for having the patience this morning &gt;&gt; because for a man to come &gt;&gt; and speak such a mystery of the adoption &gt;&gt; in one hour with a translator is almost impossible. &gt;&gt; So you were very perseverant. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Um and uh we know that the adoption go ahead and just start playing some adoption is our pleasing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says when Abraham got out of his position, power and authority. So the church of the living God has got to come to the place of adoption. But hey, your new birth doesn't provide that. &gt;&gt; That's just a son. And though he be heir to all things, he's no different than a servant, but he's under tutors and governor until the appointed time. How many believe God's got an appointed time? &gt;&gt; This is our appointed time. for the sons and daughters to hear the word of God and to receive it &gt;&gt; and to manifest not just agree with it to say amen but to walk in the light. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
