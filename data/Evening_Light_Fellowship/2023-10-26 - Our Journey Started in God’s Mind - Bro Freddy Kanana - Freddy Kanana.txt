place father fill us with love and grace shine your anointing on every face Oh Holy Spirit fall on this place somebody say Amen praise the Lord listen I want to take just a a couple minutes not to get into things before our brother Freddy comes but uh boy we have sure stirred something up since last Sunday amen and because there's different questions and you know what none of those questions came to me they came to other ones within the church and it's amazing people you know if you got questions there is an answer there is a gospel answer to that and brother Bram said the the most misunderstood person in the world is Jesus Christ go listen to the sermon God being misunderstood so sometimes the prophet of God will say something he said it'll cause some to go away some to Pond over yeah huh he said you know if you're looking for something to make uh brother Brenham a false prophet or to find some kind of problem in this message you're going to find it that's right oh you see uh this and that and see there's just another one there he made a mistake there he he couldn't be a prophet bunch of nonsense amen and so I want all of you just going to show you I'm just going to show you from the word of God and then I'm going to give you a couple little examples and I probably am going to have a questions and answers service where any one of you we'll put a microphone right up here and you can walk right up here and you can ask the question without me knowing the question without knowing what you're going to ask but you got anything you hey let's do it and then let's go to the scripture and let's go to the message of the hour because you prove everything by the scripture go back to the word amen amen somebody say Amen am amen so praise the Lord St John chapter 21 I just going to show you from the scripture St John chapter 21 of how things can so easily get uh noised abroad and different ones say he said this and he said that and here it is the disciples the disciples St John 21 are you there Say Amen amen amen St John 21:20 I asked the brother yeah good there then Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved who's he speaking about St John the Divine one whom Jesus loved right seeth a disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee and Peter seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this this man do talking about John what shall this man do and Jesus saying to him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me amen then went the saying look at this could you imagine if they had uh email or text messaging or iMessage or something where they could tell everybody and it it went around everywhere and look at this the Bible says then went this saying abroad among the Brethren Believers that that di that disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee do you see so um brother Bram when he the first time he ever said I'm getting to be an old man's 1954 he says it over 20 times type it in your computer you know how to do it quotation mark I'm getting to be an old man 20 times from 54 to 65 I'm getting to be an old man I have to write things down I need glasses now to let you all know the quotes So he was looking at 50 years of age you know wow I'm getting to be an old man I want all of you to know I never thought I would be older than the prophet at his age when he went away he was 56 I'm 70 I'll soon be 71 who would have ever thought I'd be older than him okay this is just me speaking so he says I'm getting to be an old man 20 times okay the first time 1954 he's 48 years old last time is on trying to do God a service and in 1965 April the 29th brother Brenham prophesies in a sermon called choosing a bride and there he prophesies against Los Angeles he made a prediction in 64 that God would sink that place he said I predict that before the coming of the Lord I showed you so even before it was prophecy he tells us that he's knowing he's a prophet he begins to know that something's happening now so in April of 1965 brother brandham is walking with his son Billy Paul you all have heard the testimony I've heard it multitudes of times have you not how many of you ever heard it why seemed like brother Billy Paul every time there was a convention he'd say well he'd look at the brother I'm not getting to be an I'm not an old man yet right he just say that and everything and so it it it was said and even 15 years ago sister Rebecca Smith which is brother brenham's daughter asked me if Billy Paul passes away are you going to be offended no no I because it was a conversation he had with his son like a father with his son walking along where are you I'm in California where downtown where are you in front of make company you think if if now let me tell you this is where I I I'm going to screw the screw down a little bit tight and you might squeak a little bit say what he says on tape show me where brother Brenham said sharks will be swimming in Los Angeles before Billy's an old man show me anywhere on tap in fact if you have a computer at home or you have a cell phone which all of you do and I hope you have the uh what do they call it the table type in shark or sharks how many times do he mention it twice he talks once about uh Paul who's going to be have a shipwreck and maybe a whale is following along and sharks in the water or a shark in the water Etc and the next time he he says talking about a man who was a pool shark two times he mentioned sharks show me anywhere that he says sharks will be swimming in the basement of May Company to fulfill it now I want to ask you a question any of you that knew Billy Paul traveled with him and asked him and and talked to him I want to ask you a question from the time of April of 1965 up until brother Billy Paul passed away he never referred to what some are saying was a fulfillment of that prophecy he who was there with his daddy never said Hallelujah I wasn't an old man and guess what sharks were swimming in the basement there do you see what I'm saying he missed it are you kidding me Saints don't be fooled amen don't let man some man say well this and that and you go and I typed into the May Company where you can go to the history storying of the May Company read it yourself was there ever a flood was there ever shark swimming there CU I've heard the rumor go listen to the historian nope no flood no sharks is that good enough for you that's a historian surely it'd be written down amen so again brother Brenham says many times my opinion you ever heard him say that my opinion I want to ask you what's the difference between brother bram's opinion and thus sayith the Lord I want to ask you come on now you're a Bible student if he says thus sayth the Lord he said a it ain't me saying it against my own better judgment well I tell you when God says thus say Lord you write it down amen he said now this is to my opinion okay now how many of you know and you brother Brenham talks about the Negroes he says how many of you know that there was a word that went around this is in the sermon he cares do you care did you prophesy here's a question did you prophesy a million Negroes will get killed or did you just announce that there this would be a happening there's so much of it that's just the human side I'm quoting what he said Martin Luther King millions are going to lose their life thousands will come to their death how many of you have heard him say that so they asked the question did you prophesy this said no this is The Human Side I'm reading but always if there's something that goes forth it will speak thus sayith the Lord even divisions or anything no I was just talking about Martin Luther King on this great disaster that they're having in the South with the colored people and I think Martin Luther King is a communist he's communistic inspired which is going to lead a million people to an absolutely a death trap see I don't say the Lord told me say what I say on the tape did you prophesy it brother Brandon you colored people you people of color you should be interested because if he said thus say the Lord and everything then show me where it happened it didn't happen now watch listen to what he said I don't say the Lord told me that I believe I believe it shouldn't be done I think the people to be Christian recognize one another as brothers it's inspired of the wrong thing them people that's the reason I say that not that there's any prophecy concerning it I have nothing on it from the Lord so be sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that I'll tell you it'll always I'm speaking now when he speaks and it's not me it's thus sayith the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be allog together wrong in my my thought that Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say it's just my opinion how many of you know brother ramam says I don't think man will ever land on the moon you know there are message Believers today said they never landed on the moon because I'll give you a quote got guys want it here it is Countdown the atomic age they're going to bust up the world they're just going to pull this and all go over on the moon taking a trip to the moon in fact brother brm said they're talking about going to the Moon he said I don't want to go to the moon I want to go to heaven amen he says so it just makes them alog together another economy on the moon they ain't going to get there I don't believe with all my heart the they'll ever get there so I got people tell they never went there it was just a Hox with all the filters and everything and one giant leap for mankind and everything how many of you remember you kids what year was it they landed on the moon somebody tell me 69 who was the man the first one to walk on the Moon Neil Armstrong do you have happen to know the date July 20th thank you July 20 of 1969 I remember where I was at I remember when it was on the news I remember the black and white TV that we saw and he jumps out one giant leap for man one giant leap for mankind wow it's amazing everybody's thought they didn't get there that was a hoax you see saints of God listen I am responsible for this group and this group only now if others they hear and they want to teach and they want to uh present present certain things that's fine go ahead that's fine you have that right you want to preach Jehovah's Witness Doctrine go ahead he said if Oran nevils voted in random Tabernacle and he preaches Jehovah's Witness Doctrine he can do it but I'm held accountable before God and I take everything back because I'm I'm a stickler when it says to say what I say on the DAT amen I don't care if it's I believe I talk to him I spent many time every time I was in a convention and Billy was there he was mentioning that I believe he talked to him I believe he told him those things but saints of God let's let's well some people are going to leave the message well leave it you poor back boneless without a revelation type believer you were just looking for an escape patch that's all the prophet of God didn't make no mist mistake he's telling Billy Paul Hey listen I tell you what Billy where are you I'm in California downtown in front of a company I believe that before you know man sharks will be swimming in this area did he say inm company did he say in the basement no come on and then what we can do we can spiritualize it oh well Billy he's not an old man now he's a young man and then where do we stop that's right cuz you start doing this to your children your young children and eventually they're going to look up to you and say hey Daddy ain't nothing to this message man look at all the division all this and that and he this and that and we supposed to go on the Moon and Earth is flat and all kinds of rumors that are huh I mean no that's a that is a doctrinal teaching right now in the message world's flat so I told Brother Freddy brother Freddy I'm sorry I said I take a few moments here before because and it's good and there's a bunch of questions and I'm going to answer those questions as they were given to me and we're going to have a glorious time and we're going to say what he said we're going to look into the message and then I want all of you to research it yourself amen because don't take my word for it get into it yourself and you can Google you can you know research and go to what not what's up to uh the table look at it yourself and in fact that's what we'll do we probably have the brethen I'll say do you have the table on the computer yeah okay type in the word shark or sharks then let you read it now say what he said he didn't say sharks will be swimming listen saints of God God's going to bring his word to pass however way he wants to but it's amazing that this little thing is going out and people are having all kinds of questions and stuff like now CU Billy Paul has passed away okay and what's amazing is the very one who walked with him who was there when he spoke to him about it never once mentioned you know what there was an earthquake in Los Angeles the other day and guess what water went all the way to only one only one place it's amazing just went to make company went to the basement and brought with it sharks and sharks are swimming please Common Sense Common Sense okay now I believe God if he wanted to he could put sharks in the basement I believe he can do it God can fill his so I'm not saying God can do it okay but what's amazing is Billy Paul never refers to it so why in the world do we let people who even while Billy Paul was still alive why didn't Billy Paul and voice of God put it on their website prophecy fulfilled nonsense see what I'm saying I'm just appealing to your common sense and uh I trust that all of you do and all of you are just bold enough to say brother Ron I don't want your opinion I want to hear what brother Brenham said about it okay so we go back to the and we research it to we you exhaust it brother Ezra to the nth degree and find out did he say it now if he doesn't say it I believe he talked to Billy Paul about it of course but I'm not here to uh defend or to say well spiritually and this and that and all of that and then people making fun of me saying well yeah you're from LA and you know La yeah well I'm sorry I was born there I'm a city slicker from La born in Pasadena yeah but I promise you if the prophecy was to be in your city where you were born maybe kinasa lashi Nairobi and you know how big the city is millions of people and there's going to be water come come and fill one building and all of that and it's 14 miles from the sea either God did the greatest miracle and he just went ahead and put water down there and then he put sharks in it to fulfill it come on SO brother Billy Paul always referred to there's coming a time that La is going to get destroyed amen it's going to go be beneath the sea and sharks will be SW swimming in this area we know that so saints of God God bless you brother Freddy you forgive me my brother here I give a little bit of a gospel posterior protoplasm because I am pastor and I have a right and I trust that each one of you allow me to be able to go ahead and show you just what he said let's stand stand together please let's sing if you would say only believe he didn't say I want you to believe in Blind Faith he said no ask God for Revelation and he'll give to you abundantly amen Amen brother Ram said God sent me to to come here given two gifts it's Moses if you'll get the people to believe nothing will stand in your way not even kider but there's a voice after the sign wasn't the sign that we followed we followed the voice it was after it how many of you still believe I don't have to explain it I don't have to sit there and try to defend it I just say father I believe your word and I believe your Prophet [Music] oh only be all things are possible only believe [Music] oh [Music] only all things are possible [Music] ho Hallelujah this atmosphere shall we bow our heads and our hearts and talk to the creator of Heaven and the Earth our heavenly father we humbly come into your presence yes to thank you for this time that you have allowed us to be together gathering around your word in this side of the eternity father may you come in our midst and break the bread of life and through the preaching of the word may you drop some du drop of Mercy oh Father in our heart may you take the unbelief away oh Father we such we are living in the critical time where many eoms and many voices are in the land but you said my sheep know my voice father may you come oh God and guide us and protect us oh God thank you oh God for what we have deposit in the heart of our pastor to come in yes say something that would encourage the children of God this evening father father we have many needs in the land and some are sick in the body and some need financial assistance or God emotional and whatever uh need to have may you come and meet those needs through the preaching the word and everything that will be said and done on this place may you get Glory out of the service as we commit everything in your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen as we remain standing shall we open our Bibles on in the Book of John chapter 10 we can start from verse 24 to verse 30 then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long do you or thou thou thou make us to doubt if thou be Christ the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them I told you and you believe noten The Works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me amen but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plag them out of my hand thank you Lord my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pla them out of my father's hands I and my father are one amen shall we go to the Book of Revelation chapter 13:8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from from the foundation of the world shall we go in Matthew 18 this is the last one and you can have your seat after that Matthew 18 verse 10 to 11 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven the Angels do always behold the F uh the face of My Father which is in heaven for the son of man is come to save that which was lost may the Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word as you have your seat I believe it's going to be a double portion tonight amen because yeah as the ship heard standing behind the secret desk and try to bring the ship to guide him with the staff and the the the rod thank you Lord that's what we're going to talk about so my uh small subject I didn't want to go with uh the ministry of angels again we have too much to uh talk about but the spirit kind of led me um different way um maybe we can talk about this and it going to be an encouragement to all of us our journey started in in God's mind and for a small subject my sheep hear my voice you know for human beings we believe our journey started from our birth and until our death but as a Believer or Believers we don't think that way that's right our journey didn't start when we were born neither is going to end when we die we have received the message that um has come to position us as a Believer to tell us really where we came from amen where we're going and why we are here on this Earth yes sir my brothers and sisters I want you to know that the man who spoke in this end time is not only a human being that has spoken to us but God himself spoke to us amen with the message we came to find out that we didn't start from the day we were born but we start way up there in the mind of God butam says in the message who is this madc who MC preached in 1965 February the 21st evening we start with paragraph 24 I believe now in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thought there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out that he thinks is going to build now he cannot create he he can take something that has been created and make it a different form out of it because God is the only one that can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desire now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then a word is a thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed is a word but it's it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes then it becomes a thought and then a word notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in in him in his thinking before there there was ever an an angel star cheram or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite God and if he isn't infinite he isn't God God has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite and he was om omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent omnipotent if he isn't then he can be God knows all things all places because of his omnipresence omniscient makes him omnipotent he is a being he's not like like the wind he's a being he dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything that is going on in other words him knowing everything before they happen makes him omnipresent for instance you might be home uh talking with a brother or sister you're home talking uh fellowshipping and then another brother will give you a call say okay something happened there can you go check such and such and things are you here cuz because he knew at this time something will happen and he'll tell you to go check it out you might think he was there because he knew that thing will happen it makes him omnipresent did you get it amen by God knowing everything in advance makes him omnipresent he's not like a wind like the Catholic Church tried to to present to us God they said he's everywhere no he's a being he knows everything just the simple fact that he knows everything in advance makes him omnipresent the prophet continues to say and he knowed it before there was a world how many times it's a b it's uh how many times it would B its eyes and how much tall it had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite we can't comprehend it in our mind but that's God but infinite and remember you your eyes your statur and whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is the expression word after he thought it he spoke it and here you are if it isn't you wasn't in his thinking there is no way at all for you to ever be there for he is the one that gives eternal life but says we were in his thinking in his mind am and there from there he knew knew who was going to serve him who's going to believe him and who's not going to believe him we were put on the free moral agency in his mind because the Bible tells us as we read it in Revelation 138 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world Amen where in the mind of God that's right God put us in the free moral agency in his mind and freely we were making a choice of which which way we're going to take and he knew each one of us who's going to take which way sir so those that have picked his way or the way of life he put the names in The Book of Life of the Lamb Hallelujah those that the lamb was going to come down to save them we're going to see it through the Bible in the message of faith of Abraham preaching 1955 the 18th of November butam says this and predestination is a hard word among a Congregation of people because predestination really for knowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to for knowledge and for knowledge looks unto destiny that that God being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could forell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore before Esau or Jacob either one was born God could say Esau have I hated and Jacob have I loved because he forew what they could be he never made Esau the way he was he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice God knew he would take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart and you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool God Amen cuz he knows your heart so that's us in his mind now in Genesis 1 20 uh verse 26 God said let us created a human after our likeness in our image and the Bible says he created a man he created a man spiritual man not physical he created a man he created a man a male a female created he them you see amen that's the marriage uh uh um secret here before we were one before we were born and before we came here on the earth we were one male and female God put us in separate God put us in separate in separate families and God re reunited us right but he put Adam and Eve he created them male and female Spirit he took them he put them in one body at a certain time he separate them and after that he reunited them again you get the point amen he created him one man with female and male Spirit together both of them he put them in one body and after that he separate them when he took the reib off of uh Adam and made uh Eve and after that he reunited them again that's marriage so you should be able to take your time go in deep prayer and God will operate the uh he the surgery to take your rib and make your your Eve so it's a revelation on its own so now God took that man he created spiritual man put him in a body in a human body because the Bible says after he created all the earth and the everything on it and heaven and everything so there's nobody to K the Earth he need a physical man not a spiritual man that's why he formed that's Genesis 2:7 Adam the body formed from the dust and he took the spiritual part he put it in the physical part the Bible says he breathed the breath of life and the human being became a living Soul amen and I want you to get something here for our Earthly Journey he breathed the breath of life and for our spiritual life he breathed too Jesus breathed receive that was brother says that was a promise amen so and then this man which is Adam he was put in the kingdom was the only one that could tell us how was the kingdom of God before when because he was there and the scene took him out of the presence of God and he was lost so in the Kingdom he was living by faith he was living by the word of God he didn't need to work he was just speaking a word until because he lived by the word of God God preached them said you don't have to touch of this tree you have to live this way that's God preaching to them and as long as they were sticking to that word they were alive and well as long they were behind that word they were protected amen until the enemy of the Lord came to preach a different Doctrine like in this end time because now it's not it's no more Amnesia this is an apostasy people are walking away from the message the message has come to remind us of where we came from where used to be but now this is apostasy people are leaving the message and I know this opportunity with the departure of uh brother Bill Paul many isms will arise again will cause many to leave the message so until the enemy when he came preached something else trying to tell Adam and Eve that whatever God told you was a lie exactly what people are doing today amen it's the same thing there's nothing new Under the Sun that's right so that's how a humankind was lost now God decided to rescue the humankind he didn't send an angel he didn't send a cherubim but he had to send the word remember when we talk with uh about the brother Evan when brother bam kind of explained how he car was stolen remember we spoke of it last time butam says when the brothers brought the issue to him cuz they say let's take it to brother bam which is a good thing let's take it to the men of God Amen and then brother B was the true man of God he didn't say okay I'm going to give you a solution no no no let's take it to the Lord by the way of prayer they prayed and brother bam says we s the word the spirit so that's how when you read the message you need to take your time and go deep and read and the Holy Spirit Will Reveal more stuff that's right this is exactly what God did he didn't send anything else he sent his word because the news came up to him that his children they walked away they didn't stay with the word and he has to say a word he sent a sheer H Jesus Christ himself because his children got lost and Bam says in in the message lamb and Dove now I've often wondered why God ever represented us as Lambs we are the Sheep of his pasture if you notice a lamb is one of the most unusual animals that lamb cannot find his way back when he's lost I've raised ship and let a sheep get lost he will stand there and blade till he dies he cannot find his way back he's got to have a Shepherd to lead him back and we will never find our way back through any other way but through the shepherd amen the human race lost it needs to be shephered back we cannot find our way back through education programs that's right we cannot find our way back through science we could not find our way back through religions there's only one way back Hallelujah and that's by Shephard and I remember the prophet of God remember that was William Bram that said somebody was lost in the wilderness and couldn't find his way back and he he saw somebody else passing by say hey hey how how do I get out of here he said how did you get there so I came in through that way that's the way [Laughter] out so you see we were lost Adam and Eve were trying to go back to the Tree of Life with the religion the aprons they made out of the Fig leaves and when the sun rose it dries all the figs leaves off and then they couldn't that was a religion manmade religion until when God came and took the skid of the the the lamb and covered them so they couldn't find a way back and God Blocked the way to the tree of of life he put some cherubims with the Flaming sword to protect them from coming there and it's amazing that God after the coming of Jesus Christ now he put angels with the two- AED sword to push the Sheep back to the Tree of Life Hallelujah yes sir so we couldn't do nothing and God killed the lamb to show that the true lamb will come meantime you need to be covered but the true lamb will come because the blood of buls and gold could not take away the sin it only covered the sin until the the great Shepherd came down and when he did come his main mission was to redeem us the Redemption supposed to take place on Calvary but he had to be born he had to do some Ministry preaching to us and showing to us what what we used to be taking them nesia away because when he was walking on the water I mean when the Peter and other disciples were on the ship and they saw him walking on the Water Peter said can I come to you he said sure you can come Peter walked all the preachings and all of that he was trying to show us we used to be we used to be in the Kingdom we used to to live by the word we used to just say a word something happened that's why he said just believe and say a word and it's going to take place all of that was trying to take the Min away he was trying to show us the way back and all of that he did it with his word like uh David said in um in Psalms 23rd verse 4 he said yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy stuff they comfort me our shephards always Comfort us this gives us Assurance CU his staff which is his word and his Rod still his word they give us confidence and you see the staff the curly part of the staff he can rescue as a Shepherd can rescue the the sheepen when the fall somewhere that's why you see a brother coming to you with a word the staff of God try to bring encouragement to you that's God risking you thank you Lord with his St using the curly part of the staff to pull you out of the ditch and with his Rod he can beat and take away all the beats the wild beats that can come and eat you up because the Bible says like brother bam says God always defeat the Devil with the word anywhere all the time he uses his word to defeat the enemy and he uses his word to encourage you that's his staff in his Rod great Shepherd so after his uh work here on the earth he called the the disciples because he's a shepherd He start calling them he started with the the 12 the disciples when John the Baptist finished preaching and baptized the Jesus Christ and some other people one day he saw Jesus walking by he he told the the disciples Behold the Lamb of God that is taking away the sins of human follow him some of them he called them some of them the prophet pointed them to him same thing as us like Elijah waved the mentle at Elisha and you remember when God called you maybe you've been reading a message book something spoke to you maybe you went to church you heard heard something that touched your heart still that's the Sheep heard calling you thank you Lord you heard his voice and I want to tell you here that even though we have many many voices in the land but the Sheep will identify the voice of the shepherd that's right regardless of the form the shepherd will take the tree sheep will identify the Shephard Voice Hallelujah but I want you to get something here be before you know that voice you must have heard it somewhere that's right because when you were in the mind of God sir he spoke to you you heard his voice you got acquainted of that voice in so much that whatever you'll be when you hear that voice you recognize that voice whether it's William Bram speaking it whether it's brother Ron preaching here whether it's another brother brother martin or another brother preaching here or the brother giving a testimony or a sister talking to you you can identify the the voice of the shepherd Hallelujah why because you heard it somewhere that's right and you have your representation I remember a friend of mine I can't remember was it me or my friend who one time in the Congo uh he made in kinasa because we used to live in province in bushay and at the certain time we been you know back and forth between bushay and kinasa so a friend of mine met another friend who he met long time ago so he thought that was his friend when the M were just shaking hands hey how you doing how you doing what's going on man long time how you doing how you doing so in the meantime picture was going through their minds trying to figure out where did I see him and both of them were struggling man long time wow man you get weight many time how you doing how you doing they been just struggling you see until one of them said okay how about this person he said who's who's that oh I no that was my Oh I thought that was see they thought they knew one another but they didn't you see so with us is a different story because we heard his voice before the foundation of the world thank you Lord amen and this is a predestination the Bible will prove it to us because if you see in John 10 where we read these Jews they came up to him they say tell us plainly if you if thou are the Christ tell us plainly don't keep us in in in confusion and Jesus said I told you and you believed not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me in other words you don't get to know me by just me telling you I'm Jesus no it's by Revelation you can't you can't just know God like oh yeah this is brother so and so no it's not an originally person this is a great Majesty this is the creator of Heaven and the Earth amen this is God himself you have to know him by Revelation like Jesus said if you love the word of God if you love me my father and I will come and dwell in you we will come and reveal ourselves to you yes sir it's by Revelation it's not just by casually you know yeah I'm such and such brother no that's what they want and Jesus said but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me amen when he came on the earth he preached the gospel the the Sheep heard heard his voice they followed him even before him since the time of Enoch the Sheep always hear the voice of the shepher when Enoch preached people believed it because they identified the voice of the shepherd coming through the preaching of Enoch throughout the ages the Sheep always identifi the voice of the sherp her why because they heard it before somewhere familiar places we heard it from the pastor familiar faces so these people here they didn't have any representation like brother bam says talked about the uh the woman at the well and the priest the priest didn't have any representation but the woman did like these people they didn't have any representation they were struggling and he he answered them he said no but my sheep no my voice I did everything for you to understand you didn't catch it I preached it I did the Miracles you didn't catch it so I can do other thing then just continue on right no tell us plainly if you are a Christ like brother bam says when Herod was trying to ask the uh the uh the Magi to when they go to visit the the the the baby they can come to him and tell him where the baby was born so that he can go and worship him too the angel of the Lord came by night to say no don't go back that way because he just said but in his heart that's right he's managing to kill the baby don't go that way even these people do you believe when they was asking Jesus tell us plainly if he had told them I'm Christ do you think they would have they would worship him no because with this attitude you can tell what is in their heart right they didn't have any representation they didn't make a choice over there of the way of life that's right they made a choice of the way of death so too many things to say in the message making the valley full of ditches preached in 1956 July the 28th B bam says this did you ever hear a goat blade a goat and a sheep is almost the same thing now I've heard goats crying when it act like sheep it takes a real sheep herd sir to know the difference oh Hallelujah do you hear a goat squiring it sounds just exactly like a sheep but a Shephard knows the voice because your name were written from before the foundation of the world praise the Lord and he knows you but the shepherd knows the voice that's right now but something happened let's skip this cuz we don't have that much time let's go down let's go read the or down the highlighted area and I said well then why is it that he's hurting the goat so he's talking about a man was asking try to find out what is what is it Shepherds means really yeah the shepherd is a is a grazer like he say say here like in America they call it Cowboy but bam says well then why is it that he's hurting the goats and everything he said that's right or I said I see and he said but brother Bram when the night time comes everything is left on the pasture except the sheep and the Sheep the sheep stucked in the fold and he lays down at the door to see that nothing bothers themall I say I see you can sit in the same church you can sit in the same church Shout by the same gospel but if your nature isn't different you'll never be recognized as a friend to the son that's right it's got to be in your heart not in your head amen so like many many have come to the message we believe the message Malachi 4 and such and such but you can tell as the time goes on you can tell the difference we might come to the same church and and listen to the Ser sermons and things but if you go deep with that believing or that belief of the brother or sisters if you go deep with him you might you you might find something different just give it a time you will say it but it takes the true Shepherd to make a difference let's read in uh Matthew 28 I don't know how the Lord is leading because there has too many stuff to go through but for the sake of the time this Matthew 20 not 28 27 I'm sorry 27 uh verse 50- 54 verse 50 2750 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rank in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quck and The Rock Rank and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saint which slept AR Rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw watching Jesus saw the earthquake quick and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God we can have some you pray for me as we sink a little bit deep to get to see what the holy spirit is going to speak to us now here amen so this is to show you that regardless of your place you be the shepherd will come to you and will identify will locate you and will get to you to rescue you thank which means you cannot even backslide don't even try to backslide in heaven he was there when you want to come down on the earth he came down on the earth in hell he he went down in hell where can you go in the water Jonah tried one time he followed him in the water so there's no place you can go where the shepherd can get a hold of you thank you Lord we were put here on the earth we were lost he came down and when he was here down he preached he took the Amnesia away and before he went to rescue those that have died in faith all the sense in the Old Testament that have died in faith he had to give the key of heaven to Peter follow the wisdom of God here because God knows us well amen he couldn't give the key of of of hell and death to human being because guess what you don't believe like me like our pastor always say you out of [Laughter] here amen so you don't believe like me hell you see how many people have gone in hell if the key of hell and death was given to Peter but God gave him the key of life thank you Lord of Heaven the only thing you can do Peter is just send people to heaven the only thing you can do kneel down pray for them the only thing you can do console them bring consolation Comfort them pray for them no criticize you see so follow here now is our Lord is going now after he finished with the saint on the earth now he cried at the cross yielded The Ghost and what says from that per short period of time many prophecies have been fulfilled rapidly from Gan to the Cross so let's read the prophet here as we think in the water I can see him go up this is a glorified Jesus preaching 1955 February the 25th I can see him going up to the regions of of the lost to the to a door but bam knocks and opened the door they begin screaming and wailing and those Souls that repented not he said you have Enoch I am he that Enoch had spiritual revelation of I am he that was preached before the anian world the Lord shall descend with 10,000s of his Saints I am the Virgin born son of God and have died at Calvary to redeem the Lost why didn't you accept Enoch's message let's let's talk a little bit here you see for these people that have died that was lost they died Sinners they didn't have any representation what the prophet is telling us here God was presenting himself to them because they didn't have any picture they don't know the voice of the sheep heard they haven't heard it nowhere when they saw him com they didn't have any clue because if you meet somebody you you've never met before that person has to present himself to you amen I'm such person but if you have known that person when you see that person regardless of the the the clothes and whether he gained weight or he lost weight or whatever you still recognize that person Hallelujah but here the Lord was presenting himself I am he that Enoch preached why didn't believe Enoch because that was me that was preached so and the Lord shall descend so I read that already why didn't you accept Enoch's message under the burn under the burnt offering and the door was closed with a weeping and Howling and nashing of teeth on down the road demons he didn't have anything to do with demons cuz they lost already a long time ago he got to the very door of hell but bom knocks he knocked at the door the devil opened the door said well you finally arrived did you said I thought I had I heard you when I killed Abel I thought I heard you when I throw the Hebrew children in the Fe fiery finest I was positive I heard you when I beheaded John but after all you've arrived amen hallelujah here we see the nature of the Satan's Children that's right because you see he was hesitant sometimes he's Christ he can recognize this is Christ sometimes no he's not you see exactly what his children are doing today we believe the message tomorrow no it's not the true but the true sheep of God they will recognize the voice and stick to that voice all the way amen yes sir the devil was hesitant sometimes he could recognize thou are Christ sometimes in the temple and he shut his his mouth shut your mouth don't say anything right sometimes tell us why you keep us in the confusion for a long time tell us plainly if you are Christ you see the point sometimes he can see this is Christ sometimes he's hesitant exactly what he's doing in hell here he thought he killed him when he killed Abel he thought he killed him he so he was going on and on and on but he was positive when he beaded John that was Christ but finally he arrived Hallelujah you see I can hear him say Satan I just took the key and give it to the Apostle Peter for the kingdom of heaven but I come down to get the keys of death and hell and you are going to give them up am I can see him reach over there he said he said but wait wait a minute wait a minute there's a sin proposition you remember I called if to sin but he said just a minute I am the Virgin born Son of God the price has been paid my blood still wait on calvary's Cross you can't Bluff the people anymore I come to take over amen see him reaching over reach over there and Jake the keys off of his side hang them on his own side getting near daylight he's going back and he just started up now we're getting to another point now remember there's some more people that had Revelation job Abraham Isaac Jacob all those in Paradise could could uh couldn't go into the presence of his majesty because the blood of bull of bulls and Golds wouldn't take away sin it only covered it remember in a paradise where all the saints when the were dying were kept there and they've been bothered sometimes remember the the reach of Ender she went to call the spirit of uh Samuel and Samuel when he came he said why are you bothering me you see you've been bothered but we read here that the true Shepherd will take the Sheep when it's night time and put them in the ship fold and he will lay at the door so that nobody would bother them that's what he's doing here he went down to Hell to take those ship Sir take them out of there to bring them to the place where nobody would bother them because before his coming some witch could bother them of Ender she went to call on the spirit of Samuel and he said why did you bother me you see but after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ he took all the Saint the place where they are now nobody can bother them if you want to come there you need to come to the shepher himself and he's there laying that's why he say no one can come to me unless my father will attract him thank you Lord so now we going to the place of those that had Revelation but now they can go the real SA rice the very uh predominating son of the Living God the son of the morning had come and died and the blood of God himself had paid the price hallelujah oh I feel religious notice I can see him knock at the door Abraham Sarah sitting back in there job and all all of them saying we you know I believe something took place Place upon the Earth while ago I can hear him knock at the door and they open up the door Abraham said Sarah look here here he is now you see the picture here Jesus didn't present himself they knew him amen because they saw him somewhere familiar places familiar faces familiar voices Hallelujah sir amen look here he is the Lamb that has been slain from the foundation of the world I can hear Daniel look out there and say wait a minute that's the stone I seen cut out of the mountain without a hands I can hear Ezekiel say I saw him like a cloud under his feet when he was coming I can hear job said I know my redeemer liveth amen and there he stands Hallelujah you see this is the proof of the predestination that's good and Jesus himself say don't despise these little ones don't belittle them because at least they have the bodies and he called he called it Angels the Angels is beholding the Father's face all the time don't belittle them don't despise them you have bodies waiting for you am this is the predestination so when you know where you came from you can know where you're going amen thank you Lord we know we come from the mind of God we came here for a moment for being tempted after that we're going to go back to him amen listen going back to him not his in his mind but in the bodies he has preped prepared for us to be together with him because we have been expressed already we were attributing his mind we were thought in his mind he expressed us we came down because we bypassed I forgot to tell you this we bypassed the body word the very body we are going into we bypassed it brother B said it in MC who is this MC he said we bypassed it Jesus Christ he came following the chronological order from the mind of God into the body word and then body of flesh but we came from attribute into this flesh cuz he breathed Us in the flesh and the human being became a living Soul because we bypass that because in this form of the word you know everything and Bam says when we go back to that body we will know everything we will look back and see what we did we can see everything how he rescued us how dangerous it was in on the earth we will look back because we'll be in the form of the word we will see everything that we have done in the past Hallelujah so that's where we going we're going to that body to our theophanies he continued to say the Patriarchs and the prophets answering to him I can hear him say get ready children you died under the the the good faith you come God's provided way and I've made a way now you are going back to receive your Immortal bodies sir just a few minutes it's going to be daylight and we've got to appear on the earth I can hear Abraham Master can we make a a little Whistle Stop I would like to look around the old city and see how it looks Daniel say I would like to go to go out where I saw the Visions he said sure I'm going to be there for several days talking to my other disciples now we're going to the New Testament because those in the Old Testament they died under the faith now the faith is paying now cuz the shepherd came down to where they were to take them out and instructing them concerning the things of the kingdom of God I've got to anoint them and the Holy Spirit coming tell them to preach the gospel and to heal the sick to u to all the world daylight came the angels and here I want you to notice something before Jesus died that one of the thieves on the cross I believe the one to the right side the one who said Remember Me So he died before Jesus died right maybe he brought the news who knows he's coming amen hallelujah I left him on the cross he's coming and daylight came and the angel rolled the stone away a great mysterious something happened I can see Kus walking down on the street and say you know that story they telling about that man raised from the dead I hear they say he comes right into a building last night and talked to the disciples and so forth I see Sarah in Abraham sweetheart never to be old no more arm in arm walking down the street this is not like a fiction we read it in the the Bible here it took place this is the last page Abram say Sarah Darling look at that old place you remember that yeah I remember it why I remember when I met melkisedek right out there the king of Salem paid him a thighs of all the spoils Kaa said who is that young couple looks like I've been have seen them watch out Sarah we been noticing it disappeared like Christ did coming through the walls glorified body after 40 days he pulled his disciples out there and blessed them and said go into all the world and preach the gospel I'm coming back again and I'll be with you view always until the end of the world he started up taking the old testment sent with him this is a Shepherd the Sheep followed him when he was here on the earth preaching to them followed him he went in hell he went in Paradise rescued those ship in Paradise they followed him because bam say here as he went up beyond the moon on beyond the stars on beyond the Sun the Old Testament Saints followed him the Bible says he led captive captive give gift unto man I can see him going Beyond Angels and Archangels Plum on into Jerusalem now into the Spheres and coming to the sight of the New Jerusalem there's something here give you can give me your invited attention I can hear the all Testament Saint acquainted butam says they were acquainted with this song acquainted with the David prophecy said lift up ye Everlasting gate and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in I can hear the angels behind say who is the king of glory the Old Testament say the Lord of host Mighty in battle the angel pressed the button the gates lifted up Jesus and the Old Testament Saint walked right down through the seity of Jerusalem Hallelujah the Conqueror all the saints are following him walked up to the to the throne and presented them say here they are father remember last time let's read in uh is is my last one let's read in uh Isaiah 55 55:1 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplished that which I pleased and I shall prosper in the thing where I where to I sent it amen remember last time God sent his word and his word won't return unto him void he has to be prosperous and remember Jesus praying was giving the report to the Lord I didn't lose none of them Hallelujah outside of the the son of piic Judah but the rest of them I didn't lose none of them he was giving the report but tonight he's presenting them to the father when he took them from Paradise on the earth and in the presence of God cuz he's the word he could not return back to God without accomplish that which he was sent Hall last time we saw he gave the report but tonight he brought them and we read it somewhere here he said he has to come on the earth to give the new testament's instructions because I have to come back again to them brothers and sisters you saw in the Old Testament they died on faith he rescued them now they are in the immortal bodies tonight but we have a promise that he is coming back again for us hallelujah since he fulfilled it for the Old Testament Saint he's more than able to fulfill it for us that's right amen and now when brother bam says people always believe in the promise of what God will do in the future and also they believe in what he has done in the past but always miss to see what he's doing now because these Saints acquainted they have they are familiar with these Prophecies of David it they heard it many times but when it was taking place they could recognize and were responding to the the Angels but look at the other side these people that didn't have any representation they knew the songs of David David uh in the Psalms 22 when Christ was crying was Eli Eli on the cross they didn't even catch anything they know the song of of David but the prophecy was taking place now they didn't recognize it because they didn't have any representation in their heart amen you see the difference now this is the proof of predestination these one they have representation these one they have Immortal bodies these one they are the sh the the sheep of the sharp her they heard the voice somewhere here on the Earth they recognize the voice brothers and sisters regardless of all the voices going on in the land the true sheep of the lord of the great Shepherd will always identified the voice of the great Shepherd amen thank you Lord and he says no one can plug them out the pastor was here trying to keep us with the Baton or The Rock and the staff don't go this way don't go that way try to say in the middle amen that's right so if you see people going away leaving the message you can tell yourself if they had representation or not because Jesus said no one will plug them out of my hand praise the Lord because my father and I we are one amen no one will pluck them out of the hand regardless of what kind of preaching will come remember um brother bam spoke of uh what is the mountain he was writing meditating on the word and the enemy showed himself up dressed up as if he was God Jesus crowned already Martin could recognize says the scriptures going through his mind quickly say no no no no no he's not crowned yet you see that's the true sheep but what I'm say he took the in or with the ink or something he has get out of here you see so you need to have confidence in this world of God Amen I believe with all my heart but regardless of who will bring any Doctrine any other voice you will by God grace recognize the voice of of the grape shepher thank you Lord are you the sheep have you heard the Sheep heard speaking or talking in this end time stick with that voice cuz those are familiar voices you heard them somewhere familiar places you've seen them somewhere familiar faces you will always recognize them whenever they presented to you amen God bless you richly let's stand to our
