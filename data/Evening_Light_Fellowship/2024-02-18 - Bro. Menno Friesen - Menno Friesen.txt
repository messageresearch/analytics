I uh I think I'll just sing and then let him preach uh cuz I've really been enjoying myself sitting there and enjoying the preaching I I Love's preaching just something about his so natural behind the pulpit just so amen heartfelt I'm going to put a little bow on them today but I believe he's got a heart for the people I really do and I know you feel it you know it that's the reason why you stand with him and that's the best pastor could have for the people to stand with him in the good and in the bad amen because remember one thing we're all human we're all born here sexual like all the rest we are looking for that transformation and this Mortal body will be done away with but until then we need grace mercy love understanding we need to care for one another we need to stand for one another when we're wrong and when they're wrong I'm not wrong too many times but I I I one of the fellas said home he he made a mistake once he thought he was wrong that's getting pretty close but I want to say that not jokingly I believe we're as close to the reality of our new bodies that we've ever been in all the history of mankind Lord we are the ones that God chose to take off the last moments of civilization as we know it there's a much greater civilization coming we feel it in our soul we know it's born inside we know that our Soul's repres presents that Dimension cuz it's born of the Holy Ghost this body is born of the Flesh and must die and all of us sitting here 50 years 100 years would go by there wouldn't be one of us here here we have no continuing city am I want to sing I'll try to get the brothers that we didn't practice at all can I use that might maybe I'll turn this one off just turn it down just turn it down thank you and I was asking about one song and and um you know sometimes it's on is it on it's on yeah okay wasn't sure where that's my voice doesn't need a microphone really but but I but I was thinking a while ago on so many things we do one things we uh I Don't Preach as much but I sure still think a lot there's something about you know you older people you'll kind of get with me now most most of the things we think of what we should have been doing how much more we should have been in love with the Lord how much more we should have done for him not regretting the miles that we've traveled for him but at the same time I think we always feel oh if I could have just did a little bit better been a little more genuine real there's one thing that we know that will stand is the genuine product of God the genuine born of the spirit of God now we know there's many things that goes on but I was driving along talking to the Lord in my as we do and what I always like about you can tell him just the way it is he doesn't mind the way you tell it to him cuz he knows what your heart's behind it whether you're stumble or you don't and I we were someone been talking about well they own this and they own that and they own that and oh they this that and I was driving along and said and the poor heard him gladly they couldn't point to that but as I sing a little further something said but remember you don't own a single thing on this Earth everything that we have we give it up when we die so really it's just borrowed and he borrows it gives us a bigger loan sometimes we are deeper in debt than the other one but you know even the debts are wiped when when we die all things are wiped except for one thing that Soul that's inside of you that is eternal that's either got eternal life or it's Eternal separation from God that means it could have never been in there think about but pilgrims and we're strangers here we are sitting we are seeking for that City that Abraham looked for he wasn't just looking for like a NE building brother said he was looking for that Soul Redemption that new body that Immortal seed knowing that it has in its cities and there is a great City coming we know that invisible Union is what he's looking for being so invisible United back with God where we came from or come the way we should have come that's right amen and I want to see sing the song Palms of Victory it starts in key of uh starts in key of C and then goes to D after the first after the first song in course and if you want to sing it with me I this just the one that I figured I could sing because I know this is real to me I don't know how many year days I've got left I'm I'm over the 80 Mark and I at home I quit pastoring about a year ago I don't regret it but I I say this whatever years I've got left I've noticed all my life since I've been a Christian my longing is for just the next Hill what's around the next promise of God what's greater than what I'm living in what is greater than I have today in the promise of God Amen I saw a wayward traveler in garment sted clad he was struggling up the mountain and it seemed that he was sad his back was heavy laden his strength was almost gone but he shouted as he journeyed Deliverance will come then Pals of Victory Crown of Glory Pals of Victory I shall win I saw him in the evening the sun was sinking low he had overcome the mountain and he reached the S below he saw that golden City that Everlasting home and he shouted like hosana Deliverance will come then Palms of Victory crowns of Glory palm of Victory I shall wear while gazing on that City just or the narrow flood a band of holy Angels Came From The Throne of God they for among their opinions say for The Dashing form and joined him in his Triumph for deliverance had come then Palms of Victory crowns Pals of Victory I shall W it seems I hear the Angels around the throne so Grand they're shouting glad hosana we've reached the pr when do we have just race o is run will I'll shout loud hosana Deliverance has come arms of Victory crowns of Glory Palms of victory I shall wear oh Palms of Victory crowns of Glory Palms of Victory I shall win [Music] amen amen that's my joy my hope my aim amen that I might join those precious saints that have all labored yes they died that we could live remember the seed that went in the ground had to die rot and die that there could come a crop in the reformation and come all the way to the headship where now we believe we're at that place where Christ the word has settled down on a mystical body literally on Earth you're now ready to be transformed from Mortal to immortality that's that's the joy that we stand that's where we stand I believe in with all my heart that we're at that hour I want to takeen if you would stand with me would you bring up Isaiah 26 if you can on the SC on the screen if you could I uh they were asking me I said I don't know I don't know what the Lord would have me say this morning but I said I want to read just one verse of scripture there Isaiah 26 and uh I'll read it if they can't bring it up I'll read it yes thank you in that day shall this song Be Sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City Salvation will God appoint for walls and War Works open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in thou will keep him in perfect peace I like that word not just peace but thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty City he layeth it low he layeth It Low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust let's pray father as you are The Shepherd of this flock not only here but a universal elect lady they're standing on the earth now waiting as walking with you in Perfect Harmony laid aside all denominational ideas and Creeds and dogmas yes Lord they've died to her own understanding but have accepted the revelation of Jesus Christ yeah for it is written Lord the day that when your disciples were there and you asked them who do men say I the son of man am they said well Isaiah Jeremiah one of the prophets but who do you say that I am and Peter that day spoke so boldly said Lord Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and you said blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it father I thank you this morning for your goodness bless us now with your presence come we are we're glad to be here and if there's some here not doesn't know you may you speak to them this morning if there's some sick here may they walk out well may they learn to reach out and lay a hold of your promise for we're not introducing man or wash Spirit Lord we're not trying to get the people to be like us we want them to be you Lord amen and we're not trying to make ourselves look this way or that way we're trying to get the eyes of the people on Jesus Christ that they saw no man save Jesus only let it be that way in this age for there's a bride standing and their eyes are holy on the bridegroom thank you now for your grace bless us now as we go to your word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you you can be seated I want to just dra a little on that if I can uh as I'm uh coasting uh we are uh watching the unfolding and uh some of the young people of course I realize you're all starting in life and you're full of energy and and you should be that way I believe that whatever we do we should do it wholeheartedly if you're going to work somewhere do it with all your heart if you're going to put your heart to something give it your all amen but keep Christ first in all things whatever you do you're a Christian you're born again and when you get to the place to where there's nobody to tell the things about talk it over with the Lord he's always there he's not one that's far away he's always near and U but I love this part my peace I give unto thee and if I could just spend a little time you know there's something about uh of course we love music we love singing and and uh this is just a while ago I was uh we were had a all special night where the young people were singing and and there was a couple of specials instrument specials and the one was uh couple of the violin players uh they uh they they played a tune I I didn't know them I I knew the song faintly but I didn't really know it good but as they started playing I I closed my eyes and and began to think and hearing the music oh it was so beautiful and I I thought my that's wonderful and I got thinking that's uh how Saul must have felt when David started playing and I I felt like you know by the time they were finished if I had an evil spirit in me it was gone it just seemed like oh my music it just evaporated everything that was I thought evil was gone and I thought yes you know the brother Bram says so many times God has so many ways of healing so many ways of encouraging you don't have to preach uh maybe a song like we heard here oh I claim the blood uh you know just how many times do we do that oh every day we get to a place and say oh Lord let thy blood stand for me let thy token not the chemistry of the blood but the token the Holy Ghost let it stand for me in this position there's healing in music that sometimes just a kind word amen you walk up to somebody maybe shake his hand don't don't even know what you're doing you know sons of God many times don't know what they're doing the brother bam says the Bible is written that way they didn't even know what they're doing they just spoke it and went on and some of them didn't know that they were prophesying that wouldn't happen for 800 years or more later yeah Isaiah 60 you know talking about gross Darkness being upon the the Earth well that Prophet spoke that and it was darker and darker and darker but never a day like this day amen amen you know uh you just stop and think a minute and uh which we do that always but we think about the uh the evil how it conel and brother Bram when he talks about light and darkness he tells us that the light is what pushes the darkness together yeah let me tell this and I you might not you might understand like I do or I'm going to say it but it's this message that pushes the darkness together together it's the light of this gospel do you know not even 50 years ago when I was first uh it's been 52 years ago 53 this summer since God called me to preach and at that time I thought it was already too late 1970 but at that time all the denominations they were all still standing alone and pushing the other ones said we're the only ones but have you noticed how they've all gathered together now it's all the darkness that wasn't word is pushed back together yeah and it's literally done that and it was the message of this hour it was that thus sayith the Lord watch how the prophet started preaching things he would talk a little bit and say well now that's all I'll say today he said for instance said there's there's two classes there's two churches right that's on the Earth right now now we read the parts that upon my spirit my people that's it yes right now there is there is a Jesus said upon this rock I will build my church and here comes the prophet preacher Satan's Eden and said there's another church that's being built in that Satan's Eden and both claim to be the bride of Christ both claim they got all the blessings of God they got all the truth of God come on but the two churches are being built side by side amen but it's this message that pushes all those unbelieving Spirits together against the True Light Of God but remember Darkness never overcomes light light always overcomes Darkness the smallest of light say I am so little but that little bit of light will push the darkness out of the way just walk in it but I like the way the prophet brings us sometimes you know you you read message and in the message of birth pains brother B talks a little bit about it and said the classes of people u in the Christian way said both claimed to be the bride but the light has drove it all the religious Darkness to together from Pentecost back to Catholicism drove it together tell me what drove them together it's the light that did that if this glorious gospel hadn't hadn't shine and begin to push it back they couldn't take the light of the word they can't take the word only the predestinate can we know that now but we didn't always understand that sure there's a lot of things when we look back now say oh well now we understand yeah now we see why they could come right up to it and say but thou being a man makest thyself god well he said all right if you don't believe who I am said then believe the works but I tell you one thing he said if you don't believe that I am he you'll die in your sin that's correct cuz he manifested the word only amen this message in itself is not some Creed that we put together few little doctors that we we push our way and say well I I believe this much but not the rest no you take the whole word pertinence and all amen am there's a lot of things aren't very comfortable to eat there's a lot of things pastors have to preach on I've been a pastor all these years there's a lot of things he doesn't like to preach on because it doesn't make you too popular right but if God puts it on your heart you'll preach it anyhow whether you're popular or not after all we're not looking for a popularity contest we're looking to lead people to that place and stand there and said I have not shun to declare the whole Council of God I never kept back anything I like that what brother ra said like Paul said you know I one of the brothers was preaching here I don't know if it might have been you brother Ron but you preaching about brother Paul and how how he could stand there with such Assurance yeah yeah nobody could stand there like he did and his dispensation said if an angel from heaven or any other Angel come and preach anything different than what I preach let him be a cursed he didn't just say well just disagree with him a little bit he said let him be a cursed he wasn't he wasn't and when he got maybe a little bit maybe puffed up with it and he besought the Lord on you know three times because his eyes weren't healing right he had to write with large letters as the prophet said yeah and he knew God was more than a Healer one word in his eyes would normal again he already healed him and brought him back to eyesight but the light struck him down and let a per left left a permanent mark on him i' call it a seal left a seal on him that nothing could unseal it and Paul with all that and he got a little bit must have got a little weary because he asked him three times I must have weared him many times more than CU many times ask way more than three times but Paul in in that moment the Lord said Paul don't ask me again my grace is sufficient God knew how to keep him humble yeah in all that where he stood there said again I say if an angel come or any other person let him be accursed now watch the angel of this day take that same stand I always love this part when brother went beyond the curtain of time and he come and he's telling the church and said and and he's standing there in that in that presence that Holy presence and he's talking and he said all will have to be judged by this word he said will Paul have to be judged yes oh he said thank the Lord he said that I know I'm okay he took the spiritual stats of cope and scope and he began to look at his life and said if Paul's made it I've made it already I've made it just as good cuz where he baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did where he whatever whatever he preached I preached it I remember brother Bill da one time we got to know him uh just a little bit I got to know glattus better than bill but um he was uh I I forget the message now sh I think it's shalom I'm not sure but he was talking to brother Bram said brother Bram uh you think I'm all right now i' I've been baptized I've repented i' I've changed my life I'm 90 some years old and uh you think I'm all right he said well brother Bill he said let's take God's Stope and just check it out I like that every once in a while it's good you know do that in your own life just focus your life on taking start letting the heartbeat uh read to you what you really are how do you feel about this blessed message what do you what do you you willing to to trade for it what would you give to even compromise for it come on and you read your heartbeat oh there's nothing well what about popularity money or Pride or something oh you're barking up the wrong tree amen that is not even There's No Kun up there don't even go there because here we have nothing that holds us here there's only one I I I we've been married 61 going on 62 years and uh I know I know what love is naturally I know what that is and I thank the Lord for every heartbeat but I realize this is just something that we're passing through I don't ever be without I don't I don't believe we ever be without my wife without our in because see I do believe there's matches made in heaven yes no you can get the wrong spouse here that is true you can marry wrong here but it won't be that way over there amen but I do believe that brother BR absolutely teaches that if God whatsoever God hath joined together not a even a preacher you can't join them together you can speak the word over them but whatever God has put together let no man put us something God puts them when I see a young couple like that I pray that God has put that young couple I believe that we must believe that we move in that area we must believe what God puts together and when when you fall for somebody that you love you you check it out you use stetoscope of God's word and you begin to check out your own heart how do I feel till death do us part right amen yeah not you know how it is you get through little cases and pastors we we all our life we deal with them they're so sweet they oh when they come to the altar oh the Pomp and everything's so beautiful oh they cry and they said till death do us part in sickness or in health until there's not any money left but there's so many have another thing behind that till until they put it little something well yeah so far but I I can't take anymore let me tell you genuine love stands the test every time amen genuine love for God's word this message is not just something that we like to take lightly and say well I I underlined that one yes but that was just leaving room for the next underlining because we underline every word of God is thus sayith the Lord God has never had to write and even brother BR we took the history and showed us how that this book was compiled by by God there was other books written many of them you know good books but God compiled this in 66 books and called it his word yes he said if you move a punctuation even as much or move a meaning anywhere said your names will be taken out of the book of or the plagues at it that's how perfect it is and even in the writings when brother bam teaches and you know it comes to the place where sometimes he get looks for a greater meaning of that he's not trying to change the meaning he's trying to get a greater understanding so even the commoner many times the languages have changed and Customs change but but in there when brother Bill DA got to him they were they were talking he said well let's go let's go take the stetoscope and say and he said so I turned over to John said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has already passed from death into life and shall not even come into judgment has already passed from death into life amen he said you believe that said with all my heart and he went through other things of the scripture and said you believe that said yes he said you passed the testuj you know you know just like we do in the when the doctor you know all that feels good when you go for examination your physical and you would oh my heart felt a little different oh my blood pressure is a little high oh I got this I I got this feeling and finally when you I know I just went through one and uh you know you're thinking oh that this aches a little bit this is a little a place and things like that and said what's going to be the scope when he when he adds it all up and uh boy he felt pretty good when he said no nothing wrong here no no no nothing no oh that felt good oh a little bit little bit High here a little bit here no but it's in the place okay I said that's good thank you Doctor don't say anymore because we all want to feel good don't we and I thank the Lord but see thou will keep him in perfect peace we were talking on this and just so yesterday I was reading and you know brother Bram talks so much about the as he moved into the third pole he he collected he said now I can't say this to the world but to you you see it's not given to all men to as many as we believe yes you might sit right in the church where the gospel is being preached and say I don't know about that and well I I think it should be this way do you rightfully when it comes to the word of God we have but one thing to do say Lord I believe try sometimes and we all do is to analyze how is God going to do this have you ever done that I must be I must be one of them that's done it because when I look at the world that is here now 8 billion and more people a world of economics and inner inner net I mean what will it take to change it and make it a new for the righteous to walk out over top of the ashes of the wicked right it will take the fire of God like it took the fire fire of God to cleanse you and and take all the love of the world out of you it took the fire of God it didn't just take the justification it didn't just take the sanctification it took the baptism of the Holy Ghost to take the love of the world out of you to take the love and and you know many times people they get the feeling like brother bam talks in the Pentecostal area he said you know they got they got the shout you know oh Hallelujah I oh I got a new feeling said and most of them said didn't even have a a good enough Spirit to get along with themselves so he said God has to give you a new spirit and a new heart so that he can give you his Spirit but many times we get a new spirit a new heart think I got it I got it oh I'm so happy now no that's still can end up in Emotion but when he gives you his Spirit the Holy Spirit it agrees with the word of God in the season that you're in it does just say oh Luther was a man of God Weser was a man of God it says this day is this scripture fulfilled I remember when I preaching I was in brother B's meetings that was the one thing that I had the blessing of and I stand here how many was ever in brother meetings I don't see mik there oh yeah yeah mik bless your heart were you all little people then yeah young people me too the first time I was 15 when I was in brother bram's meetings and uh the last time I was in brother Brams meetings I was 23 years old had two little children a good wife and uh but but in the message that there was those those are the series of the marriage and divorce series but when he preached the message this day is this scripture fulfilled it began to develop such a reality in my heart I begin to realize that now that that Jesus Christ is the same yes yesterday today and forever he is that remember when he went beyond the curtain of time brother B said I I can't explain it he said I haven't got the vocabulary to give it a name to title it the the what I feeling the only thing he said there was an Ever presence there there's no tomorrow no yesterday nothing else just an Ever presence now that's eternal life ever presence that's why he said he he is the unchanging God he can never change his mind about his word because that's what he is so when God ever says something just mark it down it's going to be just that way whether it takes 2,000 years or no more look at the things you talked about the darkness and gross Darkness Isaiah he's prophesying and maybe he preached that morning with such inspiration and when he finished it he thought what was I saying yeah I I don't even understand what I was saying come on do you think brother Braham understood he said I'm going to I'm going up there and said go back to Jeffersonville and preach those Seven Seals do you know when he when he went into the first night he went into the room to wait on the Lord for a message that night the first seal yes Christ first of all amen God in Simplicity but then he preached the first seal said I went into that room he said I started to think and and nothing came said I I didn't know where to start start right yeah I thought I'd just go back and read some of the previous notes yeah which were totally wrong so much so that he came and said corrected the a thought the white horse rider was Christ right come on but that deceived church right that's building here now there's one that's not deceived but there's one that is deceived those are the two that's here now building and that's the light and the Darkness yes one word off is Darkness but in there when he when he took that he said I would have made the same mistake I did last time he said then he came Hallelujah and it changed my whole mind and I stood back and I looked at said oh my that's who that is that's what that is he said I've always preached it but I didn't know it this way and he starts and he comes back seal after seal and when he is finished at the end what's he saying he said eight straight days he met me in that room and told us the truth of all the ages said most of it was history right but it came right into the seventh seal and said the only thing it did not reveal is when he's coming oh that's a good one oh yeah but see I like what he said if if it did we'd probably get so carnal we just say well you know what he's not coming until 19 19 or 2029 so I got five years come on you know what we do oh my well could we get any busier than what we are now I'm retired and I'm as busy as can be but I'm not I'm not drilling Wells and I'm not building homes or anything like that I'm just trying to keep the one that I'm in and I want to stay there as long as I can Amen brother amen but this glorious message and I just I love it because to me it's all my life how many times do we go to this message and we preachers and brother Ron sitting behind me I know for a fact how many times does he go before the Lord and takes a statcope of God's word yes and he said Lord God what am I going to bring to this people what kind of a meal am I going to set before them that they can eat and be full and come away seeing Christ the same yesterday today and forever seeing the unchanging God in your personal life yes when things go wrong in your homes which they do when Trouble Comes Your Way which it will when darkness comes to press its way back trying to push the light out just breathe your name in prayer no matter how many times brother B said when he said take the name of Jesus with you as a shield from every snare and when Temptations around you gather which they will you just get out of the presence of God get all alone and and you get in a certain place and you see something ah I know many times you just you something comes before you say I wasn't even looking for that no but he was Satan was trying to drown you and take you away from that straight walk cuz he knows when he sees that that spiritual walk he knows you're not fooling him either that's right no sir that that perfect what I'm trying to say is this I I think brother bam tells us so many times in Little stories but but U uh you know I'm well I'll just say it this way I I'm I'm a dreamer in life but they're dangerous cuz I realize a dream without it coming to pass just the way you dreamed it you better leave it alone most of the dreams that I've had in my life I've had to leave alone they were probably for me but I was dreaming just a little while ago I don't know why but but all of a sudden I got the dream and here I'm Dreaming I'm seeing brother brandom and Becky and Sarah doing that which he had told us they did remember when he came back from the trip and they they couldn't wait they finally fell asleep and he came up late and and and so finally uh in the morning he got up and sat in the chair and when the first one Becky uh woke up and she run said oh jumped on daddy's knee they'd been waiting all night but they' fallen asleep I was dreaming that and you know the story comes out this way Becky says I've got all Daddy and Sarah finally gets on the other knee and said listen my sisters I'll tell you one thing you might have all of daddy but Daddy's got all of me you know the story and I'm dreaming that and I woke up I don't I don't know what that means but Lord I said one thing just you have all of me amen no matter what happens all I ask Lord that you'd have all of me I might let go at times and I know I do I might stumble at times and I know I do but Lord don't let go of me I want you to have all of me that's I was reading where brother Ram talks and you know when you read that part said we've had faith for healings we've had faith for deliverance we've had faith for reformations but so now we're coming to the place where we're going to need some special Faith it's called rapturing faith and I was a bit weary one day thinking and somebody had said something you know how we we begin to compare ourselves it's never good to do that always compare yourself with the word of God but but we something was said well we're going to need some and a minister come up and he said you know started talking he said I don't know what this Rapture said but I'm not ready for the Rapture I wouldn't want to minister preaching my Pulpit that's not ready for the Rapture amen I'm ready anyhow see well how you think you got that faith I believe so you know why yes cuz he said if you need it he'll give it to you if God Be You therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect if God expects and demands that we have Perfection he's got to give it to us then I like what brother baham said you know in little message called said the the Supreme Grace will give supreme power for the Supreme hour if rapturing faith is required yes don't you believe that the message the word that we're now feeding on has got rapturing faith in it I believe it does that's the reason why I never take my I don't look east west north or south I say right on the message I don't I'm not criticizing ministers and preachers but there's a lot of ministers are not preaching the faith even around this message there's a lot of things that's going on so far beyond that's not even real think where did they come up with it they took their eyes off a Vindicated word a Vindicated Prophet they begin to say surely I know he but he's gone now so uh we we're in charge now yes no listen to this the very thing that happens do you know brother bam said the one thing that's we that that we we're not following they say we're following a man listen when I sat there and I have to be honest I'm going this is a confession in 1965 when I walked into the service this is my testimony I i' never heard after I was 15 years old I heard him but I didn't understand he was a prophet at all but when I was 23 years old I'd been saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and I sat and heard brother bradam and he began to as he begin to preach I was sitting there oh Dar Denise I was sitting there I about like that and I and I was listening to him and it was in the Tabernacle and he started to said I'm going to take my text he said and my text this morning is running or this evening is running from the presence of the Lord and I started crying not bad but just I couldn't keep tears back and I sat and listened and he preached and he preached and I couldn't understand the attraction until later on I understood he said you're not looking at a man it's the pillar of fire that's returned again that's the one why do we have it why do we have the picture of the pillar of fire he said it's not a picture of me it's a picture of the Holy Ghost identified with my Ministry he said and and I didn't realize till later on that that's what it was when wisdom and knowledge understanding begin to come I realized it was it was the pillar of fire that was attracting me it still attracting me it's the pillar of fire that's leading us today he hasn't gone yet the prophet said when he goes we go with him we do not Jesus does not come down to earth to take us he's already he's here this is his presence this is what separates us from the world this is what separates from unbelief is his message to go meet the Lord in the air yes sir amen I love ones will come up first we know that there's no argument there but I do believe that the Supreme God gives Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour thank you Lord if rapturing faith of the Dead raised this morning and we need rapturing faith in 40 days or so it's going to be there I believe we've got it now amen say well I I'm not don't even look at that I'm I'm a preacher that I hate to say look at things that what I I thought I what I think I am stop thinking what you are and start saying what God said you were I trust his word way more than my own thinking because I know the devil has an Avenue to come into me and try to tempt me and say well you did this you did that that that's my flesh and Paul said when I want to do good evil is present and the things I would not I do so I find a law then and as long as we're in this body there's the law of the flesh to be tempted and tried and tested but how else would there be a victory but how else would there be an overcomer how else would there be somebody standing on the earth that's an overcomer if there wasn't trials and tests and temptations we ought to thank God for the trials and the tests I know do it just like we Grumble a little bit and then we think it's much easier if it just comes so nice all the time the blessings of God but you know he knows just what we need he might put a little pressure on one and and less on another one and re me say well I know so and so why they've got nothing they just thinks everything goes right with them and then the other one seems like nothing goes right with them trouble after trouble after trouble I said well I'm glad I'm not the captain of the ship but I believe there is one that is the great Shepherd you know there's a little song that I I like to sing the ship of Zion can I get the musicians up here amen I'm going to close but I'm going to sing this little song the ship of Zion yeah I don't know if you ever heard it I was standing on the banks of the river looking out over life's troubled sea and I saw an old ship that was sailing It's The Old Ship of Zion that I see this is the one that this Gospel Ship is the good news to an elect lady could you imagine if all of the revelation we hold in our hearts today would just bounce on us in one time there is no way we we'd lose our mind for sure and and we we'd be Rapture bound we we'd be out of here I've had 50 years of laying the presence of this word line upon line go read it again read it again it's always find out never changes right only gets a little more of it gets a little bit better you get to see it a little clearer said oh my just last night I was listening brother was describing the two births he said you know what Abram was looking for was a city whose Builder and maker was God Amen he was looking for that which we should have come we shouldn't have come by sex really we were to come by the spoken word that's but then God allowed that and all the attributes that were in him could be expressed over 6,000 years and the first 6,000 he built all of it and the second th000 he's had Satan to build his Eden cuz he said he's going to build a better one than what Christ could build so he said all right Build It come on but Satan didn't know that all the attributes that were in him were able to keep that which were committed unto him all that he had in him was going to come anyhow how did we come spiritually by the spoken word yes sir we didn't come by natural just joining church or coming here we're not church members we're word members born of the word of God by the holy spirit amen I believe that to be the truth I believe that we're born of the spirit of God we're not of this world and Abraham was looking for that body that would change and he could walk into that Dimension that he was supposed to come by he was tempted like we are backs made mistakes along the way then God picks him and said yeah you're my Chosen One amen I'm going to make a new covenant with you I've already done it Abraham just just get in the way step right out here cuz I've already done it and you'll notice it as I unfold it yeah you'll see that's me right but your seed which was Christ amen and when Christ came when he is the only one that could say I am he come on he's the only one that could say that all them had thus sayith the Lord but Jesus never said thus sayith the Lord he said I say unto you because he was the fullness of the godhead body now look at him return here again this last day when those Seven Seals were open the mystery of Christ was made known it wasn't a man right it was thus sayeth the Lord a prophet again son of man but this one was greater cuz the first time since Paul was struck down by the pillar of fire for the first time since that time that Pillar of Fire from out behind that Mercy Seat come and became visible again on Earth here as a confirmation that this message was not of man it was God almighty God this message won't fall short The Messengers gone but his message lives on amen amen let me on the banks of the river looking out over lives trouble sea when I saw an old ship that was [Music] sailing is that The Old Ship of Zion I see it's all was beat and battered from the storm of life I could see oh the waves were rough but that Old Ship kept sailing is that The Old Ship of Zion I see at the stern of the ship stood the [Music] captain Oh I could hear him call out my name they called your name amen get on board The Old Ship of Zion listen for it will never pass this way again raise that up a little bit if you would as I step on board I'll be leaving you too all my sorrows and my heartaches behind oh I'll be safe with Jesus the captain sailing out on The Old Ship of Zion sing that last verse with me if you would as I said on Bor I'll be leaving all my sorrows and heartaches behind oh I'll be safe with Jesus the captain
