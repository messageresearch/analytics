And I remember brother Ron said a short time after, "Be careful what you ask for." &gt;&gt; And you know, um, I got back from Arizona uh, two and a half years ago and I thought I just had a a small problem issue with my eyes. The doctor said I had glaucoma with the eye specialist, but it wasn't that at all. It was quite a serious rare DNA problem. Required four operations to um cell transplantations behind the the cornea. So, I've gone from about 50% vision to close to 100% vision. Well, 90 on one, close to 100 on the other. So, I thank the Lord for that.

Above all kingoms, [music] above all, above all [music and singing] wonderers the world has ever known.

Also, I'd like to introduce my wife that's here with me and two of the [music] saints from South Carolina. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, thank God for How many love the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; This is our day. &gt;&gt; Glory. We should be h happy. This is our time. &gt;&gt; Glory. And you know what? Glory. One day we going to leave here. &gt;&gt; And it's looking like it's getting closer and closer to me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We thank God for you. Uh we uh want to get right to the word. And uh I like have two pastor scriptures. We appreciate each and every one that pressed the way out. I know it's her first time. So you may be nervous and I'm nervous too. So when two omnipotent meet something have to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. All right. If you have the book of 2 Kings and then we also be going to 2 Corinthians 2 Kings 6 and let's start reading at verse 12. And one of his, excuse me, and one of his servants said, "Nay, my lord, O king, but Elijah the prophet that is in Israel, tellth the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in thy bed chamber." And he said, "Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him." And it was told him that behold he's in Dothan. Therefore send heed hither horses and chariots and uh great host. And they came by night and compassed the city about. And when the servant of the men of God was risen early and going forth, behold the host compass the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, "Ali, my master, how shall we do?" And let's go to Corinthians, if you will. 4th Cor uh fourth chapter. Let's start at verse uh 17. 2 Corinthians 4:17. For our light afflictions, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. While we look not at the things which are seen, &gt;&gt; but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go to the message unseen as brother Brandon was sent here uh around about the sixth uh paragraph. He said, "Someone asked me not long ago said, "Brother Brandham, what do you think about the future?" He says, "I don't know uh what the future holds, but who holds the future?" So that's the thing. If I can keep acquainted with him, &gt;&gt; right? Praise the Lord. and uh like to drop down. He said, "I notice the point I want to say want to excuse me want you to see is that Elijah, the man who was of God, called the man of God. He did not look at the natural things. He looked at the supernatural things. He didn't look at what he seen. He looked at what he could not see. Did not see. And tonight Christian friends, he's speaking to us. Tonight Christian friends, we look at the unseen. That's just come to my mind while brother Baxter was given that wonderful exaltation concerning the supernatural. And the supernatural is what what do we see is what you believe and act on as though it was as was see. You see everything in the Christian armor is supernatural. We we not look at what we see. We look at what we do not see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot be healed only through seeing at what you do not see. You can only be healed. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we need you to come. Move us out the way. Any man can turn the pages of the Bible. Lord, you said God Lord that if what is a gift is getting yourself out the way. So, Father, we thank you. Bless every heart here. Bless every soul. Bless the pastor. Strengthen us, Lord. And we can say after it's all said and done, did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way and open us to scripture. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated. I want to say uh for a subject if you will, because you don't see it, that don't mean it's not there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? We look to the super sense. [snorts] We have a six sense. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, as Christians, Glory, everything that a that a believer is based on what you cannot see. Glory. If you want to be healed, Glory, you got to see or believe that you are healed. &gt;&gt; Faith find it final resting place on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And many in the Bible, you know, we speak of Elijah and and different things that took place. But you know with a believer faith come by hearing and hearing the word. And I know we know that we have in a great message. But you see sometimes the supernatural it looks like is not there but it's there. When you ask God for something you got to believe that he is &gt;&gt; and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; You know I'm reminded of Simeon in the Bible. Just pray with me. I'm reminded of Simeon in the Bible when God told him, "You will not die until you have seen the Lord's Christ." Now, he had to take that word and believe it. Years went by, time went by, but Simeon understood something that WHEN GOD SPEAKS SOMETHING, IT'S GOT TO COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; NOW, when you're here tonight, we believe this message. A lot of us been in the message a long time. Glory. But everything that Brother Brandham said, you can see it's coming to pass. Glory. You don't can't look at the things with the natural eye. You got to look that with the supernatural. See, and you're in church, Glory. It may be like, "Oh, I'm not getting away. I'm not growing." But something inside of you is changing. You're being changed from mortal to immortality. Though you may not look like it, glory, BUT INSIDE OF YOU, GOD IS TRANSFORMING us into his image. Cuz one day, we got to take a rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, notice he says he don't look at things which are seen, but things which are not seen. And that's a Christian army. No matter what goes on or what happens, you see if God said it, you're going to believe it and WALK IN IT JUST LIKE it's already done. &gt;&gt; I heard I heard many times people said I uh like and especially I deal with a lot of people also that need immigration papers and so forth like that. I said, "Don't think I'm going to get my papers. You got to walk around say I possess my papers." &gt;&gt; Faith called those things as what? Not as though they were. &gt;&gt; And so forth. So you can't say, "Oh, I'mma get it. I'mma get it. I'mma be healed." You are healed. WITH HIS STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. See the super sense. Glory. We used to using the five senses and they come natural. Glory. But the super sense it come. You got to work on it. You got to make sure when God says it, you got to believe it. You know, Noah acted. God told him it's going to rain. Noah never seen no rain. He didn't know what rain look like. He didn't know what what when it's going to come. BUT ONE THING HE KNEW, GOD SAID, "IT'S going to rain." &gt;&gt; And Noah held to that. You know why? Because he was looking at things that he could not see. THOUGH HE DIDN'T SEE IT, he believed THAT IF GOD SAID IT, it was going to happen. &gt;&gt; So people got up. They probably got up each morning. Noah, I don't see no rain. Is that happening? But Noah knew. He saw every raindrop. He saw the time. Why? Because he wasn't waiting on it to come. He had already seen it by the supernatural. Let me just say this here. If you're sick of you need something tonight, YOU SHOULDN'T BE WAITING ON IT TO COME. YOU SHOULD SAY, "I ALREADY have it because you got to look to the unseen." Glory. Natural people, are you listening? Naturally, Glory, THEY LOOK TO NATURAL THINGS. WE COME FROM GOD. HOW MANY COME from God? How many come from God? We are predestinated. We are the word made flesh in this age. Glory. The bride is the word. So, she had become him. So when we when we look at we Jesus said I COME FROM GOD AND I GO BACK TO God and many people looked at him and said you know don't we know his father and mother he's down here his father make caption said but what he was saying was look you looking at me walking here on the earth you seeing what I've sent here to do but the real me glory the real me glory I COME FROM GOD AND I GO BACK TO God and you s you and ME AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WE COME FROM GOD &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. This message came not to get a new group of people just to come. But it come to collect a group that WAS LOST BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. COME TO BRING YOU BACK TO YOUR POSITION in Christ. Glory. Not to a great church, not a great move, but to take seek and save those which was lost. How many know they was in the mind of God? &gt;&gt; And the only way you can realize that you was in the mind of God is the WORD THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SPOKE, GLORY, IT COME FROM THE MIND OF GOD. AND THAT SAME word that was predestinated TO YOU, THAT'S WHY YOU COME. GLORY. NO MAN CAN come except our drawing. Glory. You got to be looking at the supernatural. Noah, Glory, he kept no matter what people said, no matter what he went through and and so forth. We have our natural jobs. We have our natural things that we do and so forth. But one thing, Glory, your natural life is benefiting you here. But the supernatural life, glory, the inner man is going to benefit you on the other side. Glory. Are you listening now? You going to take, brother said, you're going to take something with you. The only thing you're going to take is your character. And we want the character of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Notice &gt;&gt; he took this text here and he looked at he says, "Listen, Elijah and notice Elicia, he came in and uh the the the Syrians every time they would something would go on. Let me just stop here. Every time Trump would do something, God already told us. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, let church say amen. Glory. So, it was in a day like that. Oh, don't get quiet. Biden or whoever. Glory. We ain't talking about Republicans and Democrats. We talking about believers. Everything that brother Brandham had prophesied. Glory. You know, mo, let me just say it like this. MODERN EVENTS BEEN made clear by prophecy. If it's 20 years and from now, the modern event been made clear by prophecy. You ain't getting nothing new. GLORY. THE MODERN EVENTS. GOD HAD REVEALED it already. Glory. &gt;&gt; Let church say amen. Glory. What is news? Glory. There's only one good news. Glory. We've been hearing all the time. The good news is the gospel. THAT'S THE ONLY NEWS it is. Glory. The good news. Glory. You go out there, you hear death, killing, murdering, hear people talking about one another, want to fight, want to kill. Glory. BUT WE HAVE A KINGDOM &gt;&gt; WHICH CANNOT BE MOVED. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE a kingdom. Glory. Hallelujah. That come from God. Glory. And all THE OTHER ONES GOING TO FALL AWAY. We have a future home. LISTEN. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS got to go. WHY? GOD HAS GOT TO renovate this place. Glory. It's it's it's not. In other words, it ain't fit for a believer to stay here. Glory. God got to change it. &gt;&gt; God got to completely renovate it. AND IF YOU LIKE THIS HERE HOME, I'M SORRY. GLORY. is getting ready to leave here. Glory. And God is trying to transform us into his image. WE HAVE SPIRITUAL FOOD, not natural food. Spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; This this came just in time. You know how many believe he's supernatural? &gt;&gt; I believe you supernatural. You in this message not because you so smart. Oh, you in here because I I'm not because I think I'm something or I'm special. Glory. the drunk on the street that got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He's just as special as you is to God. Glory. So, it's not by POWER NOR BY MIGHT, but by my spirit, says the Lord. Glory. It's God's spirit. Now, he told me to have my liberty and I'm going to preach like I'm home now. Praise God. It's not by power NOR BY MIGHT, BUT BY my spirit, say the Lord. AND GOD CALLED YOU. GLORY. He called me. He called the world. And the woman at the well. I know I'm going everywhere, but that's why I preach. You have to follow me. Glory. Glory. Let church. Amen. Glory. The woman at the well. Jesus went to the brother Brandham used it over and over again. The re the one of the reason why she's a woman at the well. But something was about her. &gt;&gt; She had a predestinated character. &gt;&gt; No matter her life was messed up, no matter she had five husband, but Jesus made it his business to go by Samaria. &gt;&gt; Really, you might not believe it or not, but God made it his business to come by your house, too. Come by and see what you were doing. Lord. &gt;&gt; And when he went there and sat on the whale by the whale, go ahead. He was waiting on her to come. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't waiting to say, "Well, I don't know if she going to make it. I don't know." He knew everything about her. He was God. He was the word. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Woman, give me a drink." And the first thing she talked about, you being a Samaritan and you asking me to give you a drink. You know the Jews and the Samaritans don't have nothing to do with one another. But Jesus didn't follow that there. He said, "Listen, if you knew who was talking to you, &gt;&gt; let church say amen." You know what? SOME PEOPLE COME TO CHURCH AND THEY DON'T THEY THINK THE PASTOR talking to them sometime. IF YOU KNEW WHO WAS TALKING TO YOU, you would ask a hymn of living water &gt;&gt; and you never HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE WELL AND DRAW NO MORE. &gt;&gt; GLORY. WHEN YOU COME to church AND HEAR THE WORD IS MORE than a pastor. That's God speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Glory. And she says, "Uh, you know, you don't have nothing to draw with. You trying to You don't have nothing to draw with." Glory. He says, "What, Glory?" "But you said something. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT GOT my attention." &gt;&gt; Says, "Glory, you had some living water. Give me some of this living water." I'm just dramatized now. Give me some of this living water. He said, "Go call your husband." She said, "I don't have no husband." He said, "That's right. You got five husband and the one you're living with now, he's not your husband." SHE SAID, "SIR, SOME DEEP DOWN ON THE INSIDE, THE DEEP CALLING TO THE DEEP. SIR, I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET." &gt;&gt; GLORY, &gt;&gt; I know, glory, something is different about you. Glory. In other words, I've been going to church and I've been hearing about prophet, hearing about this and so forth, what a prophet would do and how would that. AND YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE KNOW. &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT? Something in her when they touch her, she begin to say, "Oh Lord, go ahead. Where is a PLACE OF WORSHIP?" EVERYBODY TELLING ME HOW TO WORSHIP GOD, &gt;&gt; saying go to this, go to the methodist, go to Baptist, go to IT'S GETTING NOW EVERYBODY GO TO this this message church, go to THAT MESSAGE. GO. YOU NEED TO GO TO JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; GLORY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And she said, "The time hour is come and now is the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him." SHE THREW THAT WATER POT UP. ALL HER TROUBLES WAS OVER. She didn't have to worry about what group she on what Methodist, what she's a Baptist, WHAT SHE HAD MET THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU MEET THE WORD, GLORY, THAT takes care of everything. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. He is the word. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So when the when it says that the man that can tell you everything going and king now, he's a worldly king. He says, "I want to go get him." He said, "Where is he? Where is he at?" And so he got the army together, got there, and uh uh Elisha had a message believer that was following him. Glory. He was one of his converts in the church. Amen. And he was following Elijah. And when that when the enemy came, they surrounded and he says, glory, he said, "Oh, master." HE GOT UP EARLY IN the morning. Maybe he forgot to pray or something, you know. Glory. He got up early in the morning. He started looking. He saw the army round about. Everybody surrounded. He went to Elisha. He said, "Elish." He said, "Listen, listen." He says, "It's it's it's a army out there. We're surrounded. What we going to do?" And Elijah just stood back like I said to you. He said, "Listen, there's more with us than it is with them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wait a minute. What are you looking at? You see ALL THIS ARMY SURROUNDED BY?" BUT WHAT DID HE SAY? LORD, OPEN HIS EYES. &gt;&gt; He's seeing with his natural eyes. He's not seeing with his spiritual eyes. Sometime people can't get their BLESSING TO GOD BECAUSE THEY SEE with their natural eyes but the supernatural eyes see the unseen. &gt;&gt; It sees things that you don't let church say amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know when brother Brandon was out there hunting? Glory. He was hunting and uh when he shot the silver tip g how many heard the story? You didn't heard of it. And as he's out there hunting, you know, he looked out there and he everything was just right. kill a calibou where but he got to the place at the end of the trip there was no silver tip grizzly he didn't kill and one of THE BROTHERS SAID BROTHER BRANDHAM you said that you was going to shoot a silver tip grizzly he said that's RIGHT GLORY HE SAID I CAN SEE BETWEEN here and the camp there ain't no SILVER TIP GRIZZLY NOWHERE let me just dramatize he said you looking with your eyes &gt;&gt; he said I can see between HERE AND THE CAMP THERE AIN'T NO SILVER tip grizzy nowhere And brother Brandham said, "Listen, Glory." HE SAID, "HE'S JEHOVAH GYRA." &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT JEHOVAH GYRA? HE'S ABLE TO PUT ONE THERE. GLORY. IN OTHER WORDS, QUIT LOOKING AT EVERYTHING WITH YOUR NATURAL EYES and get sometimes IN THE SUPERNATURAL. WELL, GOD CAN BLESS YOU WITH WHAT YOU WANT. GLORY. &gt;&gt; And glory. &gt;&gt; He looked between the camp and all OF A SUDDEN THERE THE SIM GRIZZLY APPEARED. WHY? Because it WAS THERE ALL THE TIME. WHEN GOD SAID SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN, GLORY, IT'S going to happen. &gt;&gt; Glory. If God say HE GONNA HEAL THE CANCER, it's going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Glory. Notice everybody. He said, "SHOOT HIM, BROTHER BRANDHAM." HE SAY, "SHOOT HIM." HE SAID, "NO." In the vision, he fell down at my feet. Glory. That church. Amen. You just don't come to church. Jesus Christ is real. It's not just coming to church. People say, "Oh, I quit the me." You ain't quit the message. You never was in it. G. Oh, I I I'm going I'M G YOU CAN'T QUIT YOUR IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR DNA IS A part of God. &gt;&gt; G. You're a gene of God. Yes, &gt;&gt; you a part of God. Go ahead. Oh, I quit. GO AHEAD. HOW CAN YOU QUIT WHEN YOU COME FROM GOD and going back to God? &gt;&gt; Jesus made it clear. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; I HAVE THE POWER to lay it down and take it up again. &gt;&gt; You said, "But I have trials." Who don't have trials? Jesus had trials. Who don't have upsets and mistakes? Go. Jesus had them. Go. But one thing he had, he knowed that the word was profound. When that word when God said something, it had to come to pass. Don't matter how long it took. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Look at Abraham. Abraham staggered not the promise of God. We look at these is not Bible stories. How many know the Bible were read by was uh wrote by people? &gt;&gt; The Bible is Abraham life. The Bible is Job life. The message is me and your life and brother Brandham life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. The word is in the bride. He is the secret. The word is in the bride. So now you feel like Jesus, you know, he was something supernatural and he was God wrapped in the flesh. But brother Brandham says he was 100% man and 100% God. &gt;&gt; Glory. So he could be tempted just like you, just like me. But one thing he knew, he knew who he was. &gt;&gt; When you recognize your day, when you recognize who you are, Glory, are you listening? When you recognize who he is, the devil, oh, he going to fight you. But guess what? You going TO KNOW WHAT AUTHORITY YOU HAVE. GLORY. Are you listening? You can speak the word. Things going to go wrong. Glory. You can speak the word. &gt;&gt; Say what you want and God is able to keep that which you have committed unto him. &gt;&gt; You know, I give you a testimony. Glory. I had a in 2021, I had a bad stroke. Glory. Let church say amen. Don't feel bad. I'mma tell you what God did. Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I had the stroke, praise God, I was just, you know, you know how to stroke do your mouth turd everything and so forth. And I had a karate, my car, my corateed artery was clogged, blood clock coming up to my brain. She didn't get no oxygen. So that's what made me go out. And I'm thinking, Lord have mercy. So my wife, I said, I wasn't going to doctor. And and uh this is just for just a joke. You know, all the saints come by, pastor, you need to go to the hospital. You need to go to the hospital. And I'll tell the church after I recuperate them, just get the head. I said, I know what to do when I want y'all to love me to get sick and let something happen. I'm just talking. Praise the Lord. So, so we got we got there. My wife said, "Go to all right." She took me to the hospital and I couldn't hardly move, you know, just messed up face and legs. I was weak. So, we went to the hospital and that following week, I went on a Monday if I'm not mistaken. Monday or Tuesday. So the following week I had to go I I had a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia was about three or four hours away. And then I said we have a church, a fellow associate church down there. So we got to got got to thinking. I went in the hospital. They they got me. They said, "Oh, they put me on. You know how they do. Put you on wires, grab everything. Yeah, you got you know, we got to get it up. We got to operate. We got to do this. We got to do that. Go." And I'm saying, "Don't don't get me wrong." I wasn't scared, but I said, "Lord, if it's time to go, I get on the other side, be on the curtain of time, I get to shaking hands with everybody. How y'all doing?" Glory. You believe the message? &gt;&gt; Glory. So, as I was standing there, Glory. And my wife was worried. You know how to do the children. They all come to the hospital. The doctor said, "We got to operate. We got to operate now." I said, "No, no, no, no." I said, "All right." He said, "Well, you need to be up." Said, "But I have a meeting." This is my mind thinking. I said, "I have a meeting this Friday." Amen. [laughter] Glory. I couldn't get my mind to think but on that meeting for real. I got a meeting Friday. I need that meeting. I got doctor said no you ain't you you you can't go to you need to be operated on now. So I waited waited kept on. Then I said no I think I want to make the meeting. I could hardly talk. The doctor said so he got me he got me upset. He said listen if YOU DON'T HAVE THIS OPERATION YOU GOING TO DIE. I said wait a minute the devil ain't going to push me around. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's in my mind I thought cuz what's more important to me? Let me tell you what's MORE IMPORTANT IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; GLORY. Let church say amen. I'm not just saying that. Glory. And after a while we got we he got to talk about I need this. I need that medicine. I got to have this. And he told me you're going to have to stay. I said how long? He said I don't know you going to have to stay in that. I said nah I can't stay in the hospital. I just can't. That was in my mind. So anyway everybody was telling me make a long story short everybody telling me you go ahead. you need operation need this that. So I got to thinking I said Lord and I ain't going to tell you I oh you prayed and the Holy Ghost dropped out. I was just as scared as anybody else. But but one thing I knew it was something in my heart telling me I needed to be at that revival. I don't know what it was or maybe just me. So anyway, I got up got kept going and then on Tuesday or Wednesday one day my wife knew to leave me alone. I said, "Bring my suit." Said, "Bring your suit." I said, "Bring my suit. Bring bring my clothes. I'm going to church. She said, "You ain't gonna make it." Then the doctor, you get all up there. Listen, you going to I said, "Bring my clothes, please. Glory. I just found you know how you found a piece." Now, if you don't have enough of faith like that, don't try it. Okay. Glory. Cuz you might die. [laughter] So, glory. So, I just kept bring my clothes. So, she finally brought my clothes up to the hospital. And then the doctor come in the room. He said, "Where you?" I said, "I'm going to the I said, "I'm going to go to the meeting this here this this weekend and I'll be back Monday." He said, "You ain't going to last for Monday. You going to die." I said, "And they kept on telling me that." And the devil tried to push that in my head, you know. So anyway, I finally got made. Everybody was telling me I start to get started. It was on Thursday. I started to go Wednesday or whatever. And they they said, "So my wife said, "You need to listen to what the doctors." I said, "No, once I get the meeting, I'll be all right. I'll finally, you know, I'll come back Monday." So anyway, I got I got uh got to thinking about it. So I got one brother, y'all. Everybody got like brother Brandham said, you got to have one nut. You know, you got to have one brother. Everything I don't care what happen. HE SAID, "GOD IS GOOD. GOD IS GOING TO HELP YOU. DON'T WORRY. LOSE YOUR MONEY, GOD IS GOING TO HELP. GO GET SICK. GOD IS GOOD. GLORY." So I said, "I call this brother. If I call him and he tell me to stay in the hospital, [laughter] then I know, glory, I know that I'll stay in the [laughter] hospital." So I call up, my wife look at me. She calls. He said, "You know, brother," I said, "I'mma call brother. I'mma call brother Jacob." So, I called him up and I said, "Pastor," I said, "I heard you." He said, "I heard you in the hospital." HE SAID, "PASTOR, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. YOU GOT THUS SAID THE LORD. YOU GOT THE WORD. YOU GOT THE POWER OF GOD. DON'T LET THE DEVIL KEEP YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, GOD DIDN'T HEAL YOU ALREADY." &gt;&gt; And he was, "Boy, when he was getting fired up, I was getting fired up cuz, you know, just it just does something to me, you know." Glory. And he said he was fired me up. My wife said, "Oh no, you call brother Daniel." She said, "He never say nothing that go back. Every time K get A FLAT TIRE, GOD GOING TO FIX THE TIE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. It's got me going." So when he said that, I said, "That's it." I had already told my wife. I said, "If he says,"I said, "I'm going. I'm getting out." So I came to the doctor. I came that was Wednesday or Thursday. I don't know. So I came to I said, "Listen, doctor, I think I'm going to go. I'm going to check out. I'll be back Monday." He said, "I told you, Mr. prepared. Y'all pastors think y'all can't die. I said, "Who this man talking to?" He was just talking like, "But I knew it was the enemy." Then then he said, "Listen," I said, "I'll be back Monday to get the operation." He says, "YOU AIN'T GOING TO MAKE it back Monday. I doubt if you make it to the tomorrow." I said, "Okay." Cuz I had a big knot blood and cuz I in and out. In and out. But anyway, make a So, so I said, "Well, doctor, I'm going to go ahead and go." And you know what the doctor looked at me? HE SAID, "I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO MEDICINE. YOU GO OUT THERE AND SIGN YOURSELF OUT. I SAID, "WHAT kind of spirit is this?" I thought he was a doctor want me to live. He said, "He wouldn't give me no medicine. She'll tell you he wouldn't give me nothing." So, I said, "I'm going anyway." Praise God. I was weak coming out the hospital, you know. So, I got there, got it, got my wife drove me. I had to drive three and a half hours on what is that Friday, I think. So Friday I go down and and I went in the service and I just I was out of it really kind of like to lose you know and so I got sick the brothers bought me in the office they prayed for me pray pastor you know you need to go I said okay I said Monday I'm going and like that so I got I got in and and uh I I detailed cars so when I came back home I started washing my car going outside my wife said what are you doing I said I can't wash go traveling no dirty car saying, you know, how she know I ever had to have [laughter] it clean, you know. So, I started washing my car and Lord said, I was out there vacuuming my car and it was a bug, a mosquito about that big. I don't know what it was. Big and it started flying around my ear and you know I'm sick cuz I couldn't slap so I'm doing like this trying to kill the mosquito you know vacuum in my car and I kept on swinging at it. Lord, Lord, Lord knows. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; it was powerful. So, what I did, I got there and I kept on backing my car and I couldn't hardly stand up. So, I kept swinging up and as when I stopped about 5 minutes went by, that mosquito came and stuck me right in that part in that that uh corotic artery and blood start shooting out all the way down coming out out there. That was that was Saturday, right, baby? Saturday. And blood was coming all the I said, "What in the world is this here?" And that big knot I had on side of my she got pictures of it. I had a big knot on the side of my that where the blood had come down. It was it was it was going to my brain. Anyway, it it it came out. So the next day, glory, I felt better, you know. I felt better. So it was I said I had something right right here and that mosquito hit me right in the exact spot where they wanted to operate. So anyway, I got that Sunday, I would went to the church. We would finish at the meeting. So I said, I told the doctor, like I said, I'm coming back on on Monday. So I came back. Now, they had all kind of wise, everything. They came back on Monday. And when I got in there, the nurse took me right in, looked at, she looked at my neck. She said, "Who operated on you?" I said, "What?" That's exactly her words. WHO OPERATED ON YOU? GOD IS GOD. HE TOOK A SPIDER to save David. He took a mosquito. Glory. And that mosquito bit me in that spot. And I never had to go to the doctor and still hadn't went to the doctor yet. You going to tell me, Glory. That's why I said we got to look to the unseen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandham's message in the message of grace? Brother Brandham talked about how a mosquito beat him in the eye. &gt;&gt; How many know that? You read that message somewhere. I believe I got it right. Glory. He said, "Well, and so I was in South Africa. I went in South Africa and I was preaching and it's this lady. I stayed at a brother's house and uh they said his wife examined mosquitoes and stuff. She do you know they make them where they go out to uh kill other bugs or whatever you say. And she come and I was telling about she said do you know something brother Benny? I said no. She said do you know mosquitoes have that something in their body when they get ready to bite you? They inject something in you to thin your blood out. I said, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Glory. God can do anything. If he can take he can take hornets to run people off. Glory. He can do what he want to do. Glory. Now, it sound like a paradox to you, but it's true anyhow. WHAT IS A PARADOX? IT'S SOMETHING THAT DON'T SEEM TRUE, but it's true anyhow. And I never I should tell you I never went back to the hospital again after I left there. They didn't even do nothing TO ME. WHAT? GOD OPERATED on me. And we have a he is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no position in the land? Then why not the daughters of my people here? Sometimes are you listening now? Sometimes we get so caught up into the natural things we see that the supernatural THINGS THAT COME FOR US. WHAT IT NEED TO BE THE NATURAL things come far into us and the supernatural things the things that are unseen should be more real to you than the things that are seen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; When they went to go get a king. God sent his prophet, &gt;&gt; glory to get a king and he went to the house of Jesse. And he got to the house and when he got there, he started, you know, said, "God sent me here to your house to you have a king in your house and it's looking good." He bought the first barn. You know, he went brought the elegant, bought the best one. He bought the one that he thought should be. He bought some, he bought another one. and he bought all eight sons. And the prophet said, "Listen, you know, I I know God spoke to me and told me that you had a sick king in your house and I'm dramatized. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN?" &gt;&gt; And Jesse said, "Yeah, I got one, but he just don't seem like his mind, right? I'm just giving it. He be out there singing the sheep. He'd be out there praying to the sheep. He'd be running the sheep and everything. that what kind of king would he make? Glory. But God SAMUEL SAID, "LISTEN, I CAN'T SIT DOWN and eat this sacrifice until he come in." &gt;&gt; And when David came in the house, THE ANOINTING OF THE PROPHET AND DAVID start the deep call to the deep. They were singing. And Samuel took that all he question about it. HE SAID, "THE ANOINTING IS ON HIM." YOU KNOW WHY? Cuz the same spirit that was upon David was upon GOD HIMSELF. AND GOD GLORY ANOINTED HIM TO BE THE KING. &gt;&gt; WHY? It wasn't because he was smart. &gt;&gt; Wasn't because he was great. &gt;&gt; It was because God had ordained him so. &gt;&gt; Glory. Let me let me say this here. We're here. We're not sitting here because we nice. We're not sitting here because we deserve it. We're sitting here by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You are saved by grace through faith, not a work. There ain't nothing you can do, &gt;&gt; but it's the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We thank God because he could have chose anybody, &gt;&gt; but he chose you and me. He could have elected anybody, but he chose us. Glory. Why? Because he saw something in you. &gt;&gt; Glory. He saw his own life &gt;&gt; inside of you. &gt;&gt; Glory. One time David one time when when uh when John the Baptist, he was sitting coming down and he was in prison. &gt;&gt; How many heard the story? &gt;&gt; John was in prison and he was he got a little discouraged &gt;&gt; like we all do. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God never forget when he called you, he predestinated you. He going to save you. He'll keep you. &gt;&gt; He always give you something to make sure, glory. No matter how much the devil fight you, no matter how much he try to get you down, God always make a way to take care of his children. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And while John was in there, he's getting ready to get his head cut off. He done had done, &gt;&gt; you know, done all this work that God had him to do. And he was sending there. And so he got a little discouraged and he called two of his disciples. Not that he didn't believe the message, not that he didn't believe Jesus Christ was the word, but it was so much pressure on him that he forgot what it was all about. &gt;&gt; Glory. Sometimes, you know, people uh this last day, brother Brandham, he said, "This is not me. God is using my voice. &gt;&gt; God is speaking through me." Go ahead. Are you listening? It was just a man. It was God's voice. Glory. He was yielding himself. Well, God can speak. And John the Baptist looking. He says, "Uh uh, go." He called his disciples. He said, "Go and ask him, is he the one &gt;&gt; or do we look for another?" Now, that's in the word because John was actually feeling that way. Maybe I I maybe I got the wrong one. Maybe it's so because listen, Herod is getting ready to cut his head off. So, he had a lot of pressure. Glory. Sometime pressure when the squeeze come. How many know when the squeeze come you don't watch who you are you watch the third pull then glory when the squeeze come &gt;&gt; and John was under he was under squeeze and said listen glory make sure you go ask I need to know uh uh is he the one I got to understand is he the one so John disciples they decided they go and uh and uh they go down there to Jesus meet and they asked Jesus himself they came to Jesus and said John sent us to ask you are you the one or do we look for another? Jesus never even answered that question. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Y'all sit down here in the service. &gt;&gt; Watch the word. Watch the service. Watch what the scripture say supposed to happen. Watch what the word say supposed to take place. If I'm the right one, God." So, what happened? He healed the sick, cast out devils, speak to the spoke to the poor, the blind, and healed the heal the sick, cast out devils. And when he went back there, go Jesus never did tell him what, you know what he said? Go tell John the things that you've heard and seen. &gt;&gt; See, because he know John was a scriptural person. He wasn't a glory some kind of theological teaching. He was a scriptural man. And when he could see it in the word, he knew. Glory glory. So when Jesus knew that if he see was fulfilled in the word, the fulfillment, that's all it would take. Let me tell you something. Glory. bride Jesus Christ. It once you f see the fulfillment of the word, glory, you know that the message is thus sayith the Lord and right. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was out here uh last year and I I rode in one of those cars going down, you know, going down the road with nobody in it. I felt like I was riding in prophecy. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all think it got old, but it ain't old. Glory. Hallelujah. I got in there and I said, "This is what my prophet was talking about. I've heard of it, but now I see." Glory. See, and sometime we let we as human beings, we let things go fast and get get old. No sir, this message must not become common. It is something that predestinated to get YOU UNTIL YOU MAKE THE RAPTURE. GLORY. You dig in the word. Read your Bible and pray. Seek God because what? That's what's going to hold you. Glory. &gt;&gt; And John when they came back to John, John saw his disciples. He said, "WHAT DID HE SAY? What did he say?" They said, "You know what? problem. Oh, John, you just DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT DID HE SAY? IS HE THE ONE? OH, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. JOHN, WE WERE SITTING in that service. Glory. The blinded eyes were open till he turned his back and said, "Who do you say this is? I'm just giving example." HE TURNED HIS BACK. HE start telling everything about JOHN JUMPED UP SAID, "OH, GLORY TO GOD." THEY SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG, JOHN?" Go ahead. Let Harry come on and cut my head off. That was him. I knew I was in the right message. I understand what it said. Glory. What was it? He wasn't just getting a place where you know, oh, you know, it's just so boring. When you come to church, listen, when you come to church, you should be excited. &gt;&gt; Well, you should come in there. Glory. Hallelujah. Why? Because part of you listen, &gt;&gt; if you understand, Glory, I believe what Jacob did, Jacob understood he could see the benefits of the birthright. &gt;&gt; Esau never saw it. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; All Esau saw is, man, my daddy's going to just bless me and, you know, I'm going to get the house, I'm going to get the car, and I'm going to get this and that. Not Jacob. &gt;&gt; Jacob wanted the birthright. &gt;&gt; The birthright WAS ALL THE SPIRITUAL blessings that went along with what Isaac had said. &gt;&gt; And Jacob kept on going, kept on going until one day, Esau decided he wasn't coming to church. He quit reading the message. HE WAS HE SAID, "WHY don't you let let me have your birthight?" Esau said, "Listen, I need two Cadillacs and five or 10, 20 houses." Glory, you can have a verse right right now. Glory. I'll get it back later. [laughter] Glory. The church say, "Amen." But Esau, Glory, he didn't understand or see how important a birthight. You know how important the Holy Ghost is to you. That is your birthright. That is your lifeline. That ain't that that's what YOU NEED TO HOLD ON TO GOD. GLORY. YES. &gt;&gt; And one day, Esau came. He He hadn't been to church in about six, eight months. &gt;&gt; And when he came home, he came to church. Jacob said, "Listen, let me have a birth. What are you going to do with me? I'm hungry." HE SAID, "SELL IT TO ME. Let me have it." All right. YOU CAN HAVE IT. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HE didn't see he did not see the spiritual application behind the birthight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? And he got rid of the things that he needed. glory in that this world and in the world to come. And when it got to a place, Glory, he realized what he done. All the crying, all the repenting he could do, it done him no good. You know why? Cuz Glory, Brother Brandham says he despised it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory. He might have just said, "I give it up. There ain't nothing to it." Glory. You know, the Holy Ghost, I come in the message. Ain't nothing to it. I get back to it. Glory. But Esau despised it. He said, "Listen, it ain't nothing. Glory. Let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOUR MESSAGE is everything you need. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Don't let nobody tell you, God, oh, IT AIN'T NOTHING TO IT. THIS IS YOUR LIFE. THIS IS YOUR WORD. THIS IS WHAT GOD SENT TO GET YOU INTO THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And Esau, &gt;&gt; that's the truth, brother. &gt;&gt; Glory. It came to place. Glory. Jacob got in trouble and everything. Guess what God did? Jacob went through all kind of troubles. went down to uh Laban and so forth. You know what he went through? He make it short. And one day when Jacob was coming home, something in him, he wanted to go back to the place where he was. He wanted to be close to God. And that birthright was the avenue to which he could be close to God because it was a pass. How many know he was a part of Abraham and Isaac? Glory. And Jacob, you know, he want that birthight so bad. Go ahead. And when he got to a place, he was coming home. He wanted to come home. He wanted to come back to his place where uh back to his homeland for so forth. And he got to a place he got he he knew Esau was going to kill him. But he says, "If I could get back, glory, I want to go back." So he sent his one drove over, he sent another drove, and he sent somebody else. AND JACOB WAS LEFT BY HIMSELF, ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And Jacob was wondering, glory, he got to praying and he got desperate. Glory. Now, are you listening? Now, the birthright is getting ready to kick in. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There he was. He got to praying. Oh, Lord, please Lord, Esau going to kill me. Lord, I want this. I wanted, you know, just praying. And all of a sudden, a angel come down. &gt;&gt; And when that angel come down, glory. Hallelujah. And Jacob grabbed a hold. Listen, let me just go. You got to be in the unseen. &gt;&gt; He grabbed hold to an angel. He grabbed that angel and THEY WAS RASLING. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? GLORY. If you believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. He grabbed hold to that angel and he held him and he was holding him. He was holding him. He was holding. He was ras. He said, "Let me go." AND THE ANGEL IS TALKING, "LET ME GO. LET ME GO." JACOB SAID, "NO, I AIN'T LETTING GO. I GOT A HOLD OF WHAT'S RIGHT. I GOT THIS PREDESTINATED WORD. I ain't gonna let it go until you bless me." &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let go. &gt;&gt; And angel said, "Listen, it's getting to break a day. I'm supposed to be seen at the break of day. Jacob said, "But you ain't blessed." He says, "All right, Glory. Let me give you something. You're Jacob. You a shite. You You're wicked. You evil. You you you d." He said, "I tell you what, I'm changing your name." MY GOODNESS, GLORY. HE changed his name. And that name is PULATED OUT THROUGH HISTORY. WHAT IT WAS? Because he saw the supernatural, the unseen, that he was able to wrestle with that angel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. I wonder how you think Billy Paul felt when brother Brandham looked at said, "Do you want to see &gt;&gt; want to see that angel?" &gt;&gt; Glory. That should make you want to be more. How many know the angels of God encamp round about them &gt;&gt; that fear him? &gt;&gt; Glory. Listen, we're here. Because you don't see something, that don't mean it's not here. The rapture is here. &gt;&gt; Glory. The bride is here. &gt;&gt; She is the words. She been made manifest. Glory. And when I like that part when Elijah come and says, "Lord, open the young man eyes." You know what he had to do? Change the way you seeing things. &gt;&gt; Sometime you come to church. Glory. You don't see all the wicked, all this wrong, that wrong. Change the way you seeing things. And then watch the supernatural kick in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Notice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Noah. What about Abraham? And I'm Well, he took Isaac. He took Isaac. God told him to offer him up for a burnt offering for sacrifice. What in the world would a man should offer up his only son? But see, the prophet said he had received him as one from the dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he knew that God, if you gave him one FROM THE DEAD, GOD was able to raise him up from the dead and he killed him. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he wasn't looking at the HE WAS LOOKING AT THE UNSEEN. He was looking at God things that he could not see. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Most of the time people and how many know we're the mess of the hour. &gt;&gt; What we need to be doing now is looking at the things that we can't see. THE RAPTURE IS SOMETHING THAT is here. You can't see it. The change of the body is here. Uh let me just say it like this. Let me go. Brothers in this room right now. G. There's objects moving around. G. Do you know that Moses voice is here? Different things right there. It's in the unseen. You got to have something to see it. Glory. Television can pick up different things, BUT YOU AS THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CAN PICK IT UP. GLORY. &gt;&gt; So when he took Isaac, praise God. God bless you. When he took Isaac, praise God. That's when I'm preaching the young brothers up front. I be pointing. I said, I'm pointing way in another world. Glory. Glory. Amen. So don't get don't get nervous. Abraham. Glory. He took Isaac. when he took Isaac and he to offer him up for a burnt offer of sacrifice. Listen, we hear this all the time. God is to Abraham believed that Isaac was as good as dead. &gt;&gt; So when he took him up there, Glory, he was looking to the unseen. I don't know how. Are you listening? How many read the word? Glory. &gt;&gt; He says, "We we are going up there and we coming back." &gt;&gt; But that's what he's supposed to kill him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he had already faith find a resting place on the word. So when he got up there, he got the wood, &gt;&gt; he got the sacrifice, he got everything. Got the wood, the fire, the burnt offering. AND ISAAC HIMSELF SAID, "FATHER, I SEE ALL THESE THINGS. WE GO TO CHURCH. WE BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. WE FOLLOW THE MESSAGE, BUT IT AIN'T LINING UP WITH WHAT YOU SAID." &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "LISTEN, GOD, GLORY, &gt;&gt; are you listening? &gt;&gt; God had already told Abraham, Glory, that he was gonna have to offer him up. So God said, "And I I personal pronoun God said, and I will be the sacrifice." &gt;&gt; So how is God going to be the sacrifice with your glory? He said, "I've sacrificed myself." Y'all understand? So Abraham, praise God, when he when he got ready to take cut Isaac throat, put the knife in his hand coming down to the and the angel of the Lord said, "Abraham, Abraham, stay your hand. NOW I KNOW YOU BELIEVE ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; And guess what? There was A LITTLE RAM CAUGHT OVER IN THE BUSH. BROTHER BROWN SAID, "WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?" GOD HAD PLACED IT THERE. HE'S JEHOVAH GYRA. GOD WILL provide for. And let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD WILL PROVIDE YOU. WHAT'S THIS? TWO 2025. I don't care WHAT'S GOING ON, GOD STILL PROVIDE FOR HIS CHURCH. ANYTHING THAT SHE NEED, GOD WILL PROVIDE FOR HER AND TAKE CARE of her. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; I had a brother. I was in I was in I think I was in Harlem five years. Five years. He's waiting on his papers and and we just got was just preaching. I just said, "Listen, God, the king heart is in the hand of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He turned it the way he want to." &gt;&gt; We sometime we ask good that's good asking people when you ask God then you let God work on it. And anyway, I was preaching a young man as he come up the al says, "I've been praying for my papers for five years and I never got them." He says, "And I'm going have to go back to I said,"Well, we'll pray. I don't know what to do." I said, "But Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, forever. He can provide. This is this this happened about five years ago, four years ago." And he says, uh uh that after he came to service, he got prayer, prayed for him. He went back, I suppose, fly out on that Wednesday. Tuesday, he came SCREAMING OUT TO GOD. SAID, "OH, I GOT MY PAPERS. I GOT MY PAPERS." AND GUESS WHAT? The man told him they've been sitting on my desk for two weeks, but it took God to take him and make him get him off the desk and get him in his hand. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you testimonies after testimony, but what I want you to do, we look to the unseen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We look to what we can't see. And because you don't see it, that don't mean it's not there. &gt;&gt; How many time remember brother Brad was praying for a lady? &gt;&gt; Glory. And she had went to the doctor. They couldn't find find out what was wrong with her. What's wrong with what's wrong with this? And kept on asking. They couldn't find and then she came to brother Brandham and brother Brandon was praying for her. She was getting cancer. He says, "Listen, you hid from the doctor, but you can't hide from God." That's right. HE &gt;&gt; IT HADN'T EVEN GOT THERE YET. But the prophet REALIZED THAT THAT WAS TRYING TO COME INTO HER LIFE. AND HE rebuked that curse in the name of JESUS BEFORE IT EVEN GOT to her body. &gt;&gt; How many remember that? &gt;&gt; Glory. What what he was doing? He was looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Sister had it right. Why she got her children saved. &gt;&gt; Glory. She come. Brother Brandon was saying, "Listen, you know, giving the story about silver tip grizzly. given the story about all the things that was happening and sister had it right said brother Brandham that's nothing but THE TRUTH AND GOD COME DOWN GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANT IT'S NOT JUST something just for her it's in your day it's in your hour it's in your message if you meet THE SAME THING GOD IS OBLIGATED TO DO THE SAME THING FOR you or else he acted wrong in the first place &gt;&gt; praise God I'm feeling good glory &gt;&gt; all right praise the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen let you go listen he says here when Jacob wrestled with the angel and I've said this before but I want to read this here quote he said the birthright was connected to his are you listening &gt;&gt; his calling what God wanted &gt;&gt; this message connects you to heavenly beings &gt;&gt; this message connects you to the rapture &gt;&gt; all that was in God he poured it into Christ &gt;&gt; and all that was in Christ he put it in the church &gt;&gt; glory He I want to be saved. Glory. If you were saved, you were saved from the foundation of the world. He said, well, repent, &gt;&gt; Gloria. &gt;&gt; We had to stop baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. I was building a new church. Brother Ron, I thank God for him coming out praying for it. Praying for us. And while I was out there on the laid the foundation, I had a contractor. I had five contractors. Look, you know how they each one get the different prices of her. But the fifth one came and he was talking about, oh, he loved the Lord and he loved the Lord Jesus. And he start talking about. So I start witnessing to him about brother Brandham. He says, you know, I can't understand my Bible. He said, I read about it. I read it. It don't make sense to me. I said I said, have you received the Holy Ghost? Did you believe? &gt;&gt; I just just testing the waters. He says, yeah, I mean, I got baptized. said, "How were you baptized? Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." So, I took him to Acts 2:38. I said, "Repent and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." I said, "Without the Holy Ghost, you can't under God uh reveals himself by revelation is not read until it's not read." He said, "Who do men say that I am? Son, the Christ, the son of the living God." He said, "Blessed are thou shalt Simon by Jonah." What happened after I told him that? He says, "Listen, can I I I want to be baptized." So I took them in baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the contract he tell me let me tell you what he said I would help you build help you build your church I do that that's not why I baptize God had you to come to me to get your life straight right I said what you want to do is up YOUR BUSINESS BUT MY BUSINESS WAS GOD'S BUSINESS AND that's to get you on the right track &gt;&gt; he said thank you thank you pastor ever since then glory he been calling me and I've been sharing sharing the sharing the message with him glory and finally I got a to open up the serpent seed. And he said, "Man, I ain't never heard nothing like this." And I let him know. I said, "That didn't come from me. God sent a prophet." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he promised that he'll send you Elijah. And I asked him, "Have you Elijah?" He said, "Where is that?" I took him to Malachi 4. I said, "This is for you. This is personally for you." And you know what, glory? You know what happened? They made him a deacon in his Baptist church. They made [laughter] they they made him a deacon. They told him he could preach. He called me a preacher. I said, "I you if God ain't call you, you going to be cursed." He said, "Well, they want me to preach and do something." I said, "You better be cursed." I said, "What the devil is doing is trying to trap you in the system." He said, "Yeah, I see it. I see it." He said, "But what I'mma do, my wife," he said, "my wife lead the choir." I SAID, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. AIN'T NO EXCUSE. BE NOT PARTAKERS OF THEIR sin that you receive not of." You can't compromise with the devil. Glory. When you look into the unseen, glory, when you're looking at what GOD SAID, GOD PROMISED is unto you, to your children, all that above. We are here in this message, not because of us. It's because God predestinated us before the foundation of the world. And he called you bride. God bless you. God bless you. Glory. Listen. Just because you don't see it, that don't mean it's not there. &gt;&gt; Glory. Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads, listen. I don't want to keep you long. Lord, this is a church here. We had evening light tabernacles. It's like a that little girl, Lord, that she went down there as a man that can turn on the lights. Father, I pray that you bless this church. Bless the pastor. Thank you, Lord, for your grace. And Lord, we try to say what you placed upon our heart, Lord. But my main main subject and thing that I want today is this. Glory. We just can't look at things as natural that we see every day in our lives. Lord, angels is around us. When Gahaza looked, he saw angels round about in the in in the mountains. [music] Lord, we just like Mary. The word has come to the bride, Lord. and brother Brandham as you bought the message. It was to bring us into [music] into into the supernatural things and and the third pool and the Lord glory and he asked Lord before when Mey was sick before the doctor touch her let it be gone Lord because he knew Lord that your word you are a God. You take these natural things and you bring us into the supernatural. Move them out the way that Lord, we have some trust with angels in another dimension. We are here [music] because we come from God and we're going back to God. Lord, bless this church in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Praise the Lord. [applause] Appreciate this. Thank you, Lord. Brother Ron, God bless you. [cheering] Praise God. God Because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Too much of the time it is our carnal eyes. It is. We're trying to understand a realm that we will never understand through these five senses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham says, "God gives to the elect seed a super sense." &gt;&gt; The super &gt;&gt; he says, "What is that super sense?" It's faith. &gt;&gt; And faith is a gift of God. How do I get more faith? Faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; People don't realize you want more faith. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Then you got to do more hearing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church. That's why we fellowship together. That's why we read. &gt;&gt; Why? Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother uh Benny, for taking the word and giving us different examples and going here and here and there and [music] &gt;&gt; all of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. It reveals things that were not. &gt;&gt; Abraham was given a promise. He's going to have a seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; But it took 25 years. And when the condition got so bad that his body and his that of his wife Sarah was dead also. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did that stop God? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; And Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; What God expects you to do is not to produce the word Yes, &gt;&gt; just believe it. &gt;&gt; Let God bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He's the one who will do it. &gt;&gt; He said it. I believe it. That settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Let's sing that song. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Open the [singing] eyes of Come on. Open the [singing] eyes of my heart. &gt;&gt; I want to see [music] you. [singing] &gt;&gt; I want to see [music and singing] you once again. &gt;&gt; Open [singing] the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open [singing and music] the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. Oh, I want [music and singing] to see you. To see you [singing] high and lifted [music] up. Shining [singing] in the light of your glory. [music] Oh, pour out your power [singing and music] and love as we sing. Holy, holy, holy. [music] Oh, I want to see you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see [music and singing] you. Open the eyes [singing and music] of my heart, Lord. Open the [singing] eyes of my heart, Lord. I [music] want to see you, Lord. [singing] I want to [music] see you. [music] Open [singing] the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open [music and singing] the eyes of my heart. Oh, I want to see you. Oh, I [music and singing] want to see you. Oh, [music] see [singing] you high and lifted up. Shining [music and singing] on the light of your glory. Oh, pour [music] out your power [singing] and love as we sing. Holy, holy, holy. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see [music] you. I want [music and singing] to see you. M &gt;&gt; you know saints sometimes &gt;&gt; we miss seeing him &gt;&gt; and he's walking right there with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The two on the road to Emmus. &gt;&gt; Emmas means earnest desire. &gt;&gt; And here it was God fulfilling his word. These are disciples. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus. &gt;&gt; And here it was. They were all discouraged and downtrodden like [music] some of us get. We don't see God, you know, we've asked for this, we've asked that, and we thought this should have come to pass. We thought this and that. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God goes contrary to our understanding. &gt;&gt; And there he had an invisible union. He joined himself to them. And he began to from the scriptures [music] go back into the Old Testament and he talked about all the scriptures that pertained to him and what he was going to do. He was taking modern events &gt;&gt; and making them clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Their hearts be to burn. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "And their eyes were holding that they did not see him. &gt;&gt; And he was right there with them. help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the day was far spent." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus made as though he would go further. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he says, "I I just got to keep going." And he wants you to ask him, &gt;&gt; "Stay here with me." [music] &gt;&gt; You know, if you don't ask him and if you don't persevere and you don't see God, listen, he's God. &gt;&gt; He doesn't play games. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So they compelled him and said, "Stay here with us. The day is far spent." &gt;&gt; And he sat down and he took bread and he break it. &gt;&gt; And when he took, now remember now, let's go back to the scriptures. Jesus said, "I am the bread which comes down from heaven." &gt;&gt; So the bread that he broke, there was a natural bread there, but he broke something else. He broke the word of God and unveiled their eyes and all of a sudden they saw him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They got so excited they run all the way back. But God, what he does now watch this. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You when you're going through a trial and a test, quit looking with natural eyes. Get alone with God &gt;&gt; and ask God, God, I know there's more in the supernatural realm around me. I am encompassed &gt;&gt; by hope &gt;&gt; host of angels. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then let God open your eyes &gt;&gt; and then you realize, wow, [music] &gt;&gt; wow. But then what God does once he shows you he's here, &gt;&gt; he pulls back into that supernatural realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; He pulls back. Then you don't see him. &gt;&gt; Not with the natural eye. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they from that day forward. Never would look again with such natural eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. God help us &gt;&gt; that we quit looking at the things which are around us with carnal eyes, &gt;&gt; but we begin to look at spiritual things that are happening all around us. And I'll tell you what, it will give you a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for coming to the house of the Lord tonight. God bless each and every one of you. And brother Benny, God bless you for being here with us. We appreciate it. God bless you, Richie. Bless your ministry. You're going to go down to Tucson to them meetings down there, Brother Israel.
