to amputate uh I'm not sure amputate something here the cancer made it a honeycomb Josh needs healing and I don't know who this Josh is but it doesn't matter what stage the cancer is because we had a

that this morning also she's still in the ER and she needs a room none of these things move us we are looking to Our God's promise of healing amen just a great man of faith for the dawn he is and

a Christian to serve the Lord amen and I also want to thank and I want to welcome my in-laws are here with us tonight and happy to have them in town and so if you have your Bibles let's turn to proverbs three Proverbs 3 and then we'll turn to Isaiah 30. Proverbs 3 23 it says then then Thou shalt walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble when that lie is down thy shall not be afraid yea Thou shalt lie down in thy sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of sudden fear neither of desolation of the wicked when it cometh when it cometh not if but when it comes be not afraid for the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken for the Lord shall be thy confidence Isaiah 30 and verse 15. and it says for thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel in returning in the rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence in quietness and confidence shall be your strength you can have your seats this evening so this evening I would like to speak on a little different subject or is a subject that came to me and I was fellowshipping with another brother and as we begin to talk in this this subject just kind of came up and tonight I would like to title the sermon quiet confidence quiet confidence and I know that the Lord placed us upon my heart and as I begin to to look into it you begin to pray and you begin to wait upon the Lord and at the time I didn't have a scripture for it but then as we see here but the scripture says in quietness in quietness and in confidence will be your strength and so I began to look at quite quiet confidence to a believer it's all right we'll get through I think I think it's come through this morning right here perfect all right so quiet confidence to a believer in as I begin to look into it you know the the prophet doesn't say necessarily something about it but in Hidden terms and different things we can see that as a Believer they have a confidence about them they have a way about them now it's a quiet confidence there's a reason I'm calling it because we know that the the christ-like character is not arrogant it is not puff shirt it's not proud it's not anything like that but it's a confidence from within because when you know who you are and when you realize the day and hour that we're living in you can have a confidence and you can have an assurance when you have this confidence you can begin to look at your situation a little bit different you can look the devil in the eye whether it be sickness whether it be a doctor's report and know that I have a different report I have somebody else that has a higher say and we begin to trust and have confidence in that so let me ask you tonight where does your confidence lie this evening where does your confidence lie because we see in a world that we live in in a time in a in the day and age that we live in they're pushing for you to be confident in Who You Are be confident what you believe be confident and what God made you to be that's what they're saying because look at what month we're living in what month is it June what's June it's pride month they want you to be confident in Who You Are if you want to be a boy be a boy if you want to be a girl be a girl but be confident you see the perversion of it and you see this perversion coming in and and it's bombarding the minds of the people it's programming the minds of the people and now we see that you know I had a customer and he asked me if I was going to drive my Ford truck anymore I didn't know what he was talking about so then he showed me the commercial and it has two trucks driving side by side and they're covered in mud and they're racing side by side and they're all racing they're covered in mud and then all of a sudden they go through a puddle and one's a red Ford Raptor they're continue racing then the next one goes through a puddle and it's covered in rainbow for pride month right and it's now they're programming these people but the thing I don't understand is Ford's motto and stuff is Built Tough now tell me what's tough about that what is tough about that but you see they're just bombarding the minds of the people and it's the world we live in and I'm sure you see it everywhere and you go into stores and now Target is targeting the the children and now they have from babies they can have mixed uh bathing suits and all these gender neutral all these different things now they're going at the kids God forbid how as the years go on what will this world be you see the progression of it but yet if they have that confidence I can have another confidence that this world is not my home that I'm going to a city whose Builder and maker is gone then I'm going to that City and God has created us and we can have a confidence and we can have an assurance that in this world that we're living in that if they're programming the minds of those kids help us God to program the minds of our kids to have confidence in who they are that we don't need a month to tell us and be proud of who we are but I got 12 months out of the year to declare that I'm a Christian they got 365 days a year to profess profess Christianity to live Christ to be confident in who I am we have a right to be confident because it's what God called us to be you have to put your confidence in something you have to put your confidence in something you see even from a young age and kids I can take Nolan for an example we have a swimming pool and the kid will jump in no fear but he has the confidence that Dad will catch him we're teaching them to swim but he has the confidence in the little young the the at his early age he doesn't realize the danger that lays before him the danger that lays before him that whenever he jumps in that pool he has the confidence that dad's going to catch him but if I could say it this way he's a moment from death we see death all over from kids drowning in pools but yet he doesn't even realize the confidence that he's placing in his dad's hands he doesn't realize even when I was a you know you're younger and you're growing up and as long as Dad is there everything's gonna be all right the confidence is there the Assurance is there I can remember going we went to a reservation Lake and when we used to go to Holly Lake and before Holly Lake and we'd go to reservation a few days before and we'd go well anyway we went on this hike we went to the little storefront there at Reservation Lake and the the Indian man there said yeah you know we there was a creek that branched off from the lake and it ran supposedly to the other Lake well that's what he told us and said he said it was a couple miles Downstream if you walk it and so we were walking you know we walked part of it one day and we were fishing we were catching these brown trout and all these different things we're having a good time we're like oh well let's just walk to the next Lake because this man told us that it connected so he sent my mom to the other Lake you'll pick us up at this time and so my dad and my brothers when we get all our gear together and us boys you know when you're you're young you just pack your fishing pole that's the essential you don't care about food you don't care about water and why because Dad's got it covered so we had this confidence that because Dad was with us when we get to walking and it was supposed to be like a mile maybe too if I remember correctly well five hours later it seemed like forever we're still walking this Creek the creek runs out there is no other Lake no service no nothing but yet I had a confidence because I was with Dad I had an assurance that I was with Dad and as we kept walking the other boys the other brothers got tired and we would have to I would stick with Dad because I knew if I didn't lose dad I was going to be all right and so we would leave back a a food trail for him we'd leave water at this stump and then an Apple at this stump and a banana at this dump just so that they would keep on the same Trail but yet what I'm getting at is I never lost confidence because I was with Dad but yet we have another Heavenly Father we have another Heavenly Father Who Watches Over Us who protects us we sing the song I have a father before the world began before the world began I was in him and we have that assurance we have that confidence in our heavenly father and you see many times when we can trust in that confidence that we have in God that everything's going to be all right everything's going to be all right you see many times whenever I come to the pulpit I realize behind that door I'm nervous I can carry the burden of the responsibility but I have a confidence that whenever I walk through that door that God is going to speak to his people that God is going to minister a word to the needs of his people but you have to have that approach you guys have to come with a confidence in the minister not in a man but in the gift of God because many times where we go wrong is we begin to you know if I were to say something and it hits down home or you might take it as it's from me the man James but you got to realize that that's how God speaks to his people that's how God ministers to the hearts of your people that if a minister can get behind the sacred desk and minister to the needs that are on your heart but you have to have a confidence you have to have an assurance brother Branham says in Revelation chapter 5 61 he says I think it's come to a time that when we've got to know how we stand how can you do anything unless you've got faith in what you're doing you've got to have faith and that's my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the Believers faith and confidence in what they're standing for because it is the word of the Lord then as long as through the scripture it's sovereignly placed from Genesis to revelations back and forth and up and down and not a way for the devil to move in there anyway anywhere then you've got perfect confidence you see you know where you're standing it's not just a confidence but it's a perfect confidence you know it's a I begin to think and the perfect confidence and it's the confidence that Elijah had when the army of Syria came looking for him let's read in our Bible Second Kings six second king six in verse 8 then the king of Syria award against Israel and took counsel with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be thy camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou has that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians or come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved him there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled with of these for these things and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel show me the traitor amongst us he thought there was somebody giving away his tactics so he thought somebody was giving away his secrets and one of the servants said none my Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in thy chain bed chamber you see that's why you got to have confidence in man of God that's why you got to have confidence in a god-called pastor that's why you have confidence in them in the prophet of this day why because the prophet is a force here he tells you where the enemy is he tells you his tactics he's telling you where he's going to be he says don't go down that route there's trouble ahead don't take that job don't take don't go in this direction what is it God's watching out for you that's why you got to have confidence in that man so you can respect his advice and his Direction and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan or dolphin therefore sin he thither horses and chariots and a great host and there came by Night encompassed the city about when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him alas my master how shall we do what should we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with him you see Elijah had a confidence he had an assurance he knew who God was I can imagine that servant and sitting there wondering I only count two of us there's only two of us and all of them now tell me how is that possible because if you're looking with your natural eyes you'll miss it if you're looking at your circumstances through your natural eye you'll miss it and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw him behold the mountains was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha you see I pray that God would do the same thing tonight that he would show that there is more of us than there is with them that there's more of us there's more with you there's more that back you then the Devils you're facing then the trials you're going through then the circumstance there's more of us than the enemies we are facing and we know the rest of the story and I'll save it for time but we know that the men came down and God blinded the eyes of those men he blinded the eyes of his enemy and he was even able to lead his enemy you see when you have confidence in God you get to direct your enemy you get to tell him you get to stand against him Psalms 118 and 8 says it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in a man you see men will fail you a job will fail you naturally things will fail you but God will never fail you you can have perfect confidence in that our confidence should lie on nothing less than Jesus Christ and no matter the situation we can have confidence in it no matter the situations we Face even within our church and the prayer requests have gone forth brother Neil it seems like an impossible situation what was in a possible situation but yet you can have confidence that God is working all things for his good that Josiah even though he's down in Florida in the different circumstances God is working all things for his good we can have confidence that he's has it all in his hands the reason that we can have confidence in that because God has already paid the price God has already done the work God has already done the work and paid the price for your deliverance he's already paid it for healing God has already done the work and I begin to think on there was one hopeless situation that we would say was hopeless in the Bible and there was a woman that was ill-famed and a bad reputation and one that if you were associated with her you would be looked down upon a woman that many would say there was no chance there was no hope this woman named Rahab was a part of God's plan she was a part of the taking down of a stronghold Naturally Speaking though we look at the circumstance as hopeless God gives hope to the Hopeless you see after she hit the spies those spies gave her a a token that if you throw the scarlet cord out of the window not only you but your household will be saved that's why I keep this scarlet cord in my Bible as a reminder see I know that God honors the scarlet cord what is it it's a token given to you that the price has been paid that Redemption has already happened that if I have confidence in those spy's words if I have confidence we have had confidence in the in those spies words that there is protection that destruction was coming but if I had to scarlet cord it was a token for safety not only for me but for my family it's the same thing that happened in Israel or in Egypt with the children of Israel we know this Saints we can't go so far without and I listened the other day on the token it's a good sermon it's a good reminder it's something that you should Refresh on all the time why because the token is what's going to get you out of here the token being applied to your life is what's going to get you out of here that's what's going to be protected I can imagine the young men the oldest Sons in Egypt dad are you sure the tokens apply dad are you sure are you sure we're doing everything we can are we protected am I safe because the token must be applied to our homes we cannot Jeep in the token we must apply it in 2023 we must have the token applied and not just applied to our house but to apply to the doorposts of our hearts because wherever I go that token goes and I know that I'm covered you see if you know if you know that you got the token you can have confidence in that if I bought a ticket a plane ticket I know that the price has been paid and I got confidence in that ticket I can have confidence no matter who tries to stop me I know that I've already paid it I know that I got a spot on that plane it's the same thing if you got the token applied if you got the token in your life there is a spot in glory for you there's a spot in heaven for you nobody can fulfill that nobody can take that place from you that's yours and you gotta claim it it's that quiet confidence from within full obedience to the word entitles you to the token full obedience not partial not what you think or what you want to squeeze in or the prophet didn't mean this or he didn't mean that or maybe we can get by with this that's when we cheapen the token when you say I've been in this message for 20 years in the last 10 years I've been living the same I've been doing the same I've been I'm fine but is that token applied it's the confidence that the shunami woman had with Elisha you know the story spoke to me and the prophet uses this line concerning her approach and the other day we spoke with the young people about having the right approach and approaching God the right way because if you approach it the right way you can have confidence in the way that you've approached it in that your attitude toward your approach is everything your attitude to your approach is everything if you have a bad attitude and you come to God and I deserve this and give me this and do this for me and I need this and this is the way it has to be your approach is wrong but we must check our attitude toward our approach because here in Inspiration 56 it was just one sentence that kind of spoke to me he says if you want to find a favor from God be a favor to God if you want a favor from God be a favor to God you understand what that says if you want something from God do something for God if you want something from God do something for God what can I do for you today who can I reach out to who can I text who can I call if you want to be you want a favor be a favor he also preaches a sermon called he cares do you care he cares do you care because when you begin to care when you begin to put God first in your life then he'll begin to care he'll be care begin to care about that situation you're going through that trial you can't overcome when you begin to care he cares and we see that this woman and we'll we'll turn in Second Kings Four this woman was promised a baby and and we know the story that you know the baby would go out and be raised and be working in the field with the father and the and then the baby would end up dying the Young The Young Lad would end up dying and the the mother there would be take the baby into prophets bed and brother Branham says what a place to put them what a place to take him is to the prophets because we know be a favor we know that her approach in this situation was that the prophet would pass by their house the prophet would come by their house and she was like what can I do what can I do and so she made this little house for the for the prophet for Elisha and he would begin to be able to rest and Abed and we know the story and God would honor her faith she didn't come to the the prophet there and say I need I have this need I have this desire but yet she was a favor and God discerned her heart and gave her a child and we know that the baby died and she was inspired and had this confidence that if I can get to the man of God I have a confidence that if I can get to that man of God that he can change his circumstance let us read in Second Kings 4 and 22. and he called into her husband and said send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him today it is neither New Moon nor Sabbath and she says it shall be well it shall be well you see she had a confidence that if I can get to that man that the man of God will change my circumstance you see whatever you place confidence in I'm going to stop right there whatever you place confidence in God will honor that I do believe that I do believe that whatever circumstance you're going through maybe it's a sickness whatever it might be and I've had it in my life that whatever you put confidence in God will honor that if you need hands laid on you God will honor that if you go through a prayer line God will honor that if you can speak the word God will honor that because you have confidence in God's word it doesn't get away with one or the other but it's all of them what do you have confidence in God will honor your faith it shall be well verse 24 and then she saddled in the ass and said to her servant drive and go further it's like not thy riding for me except I bid thee so she went and came unto the man of God to the Mount Carmel and it came to pass when the man saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold Yonder is a shunamite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it is well it is well why because she had a confidence listen this your circumstances your situations might not always be well but when you know the one that is well all is well when you know the one that can pay the price the one that's redeemed you the one that's you see the situation might be hard it might be impossible but it is well and when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him at the feet in gehazi came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me so you're telling me that God doesn't tell His prophets everything God doesn't show them everything why because confidence just can't lie in the man confidence just can't lie in the man that the prophet do everything he wouldn't need confidence in a gift that's in his life but yet God doesn't show him everything because they still need confidence in God they still need leadership they can do nothing unless the father show them that's what Jesus said I can do nothing unless the father first show me right so we don't just get our confidence from a man but we get our confidence from the god in the man that's where it lies and then she said I desire did I desire thee a son my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me then he said to gehazi gird up that loins and take thy staff my staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute the answer him not again and lay my staff upon his faith on the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her you see she had confidence in something greater she had confidence in something she went there for a purpose she knew exactly what she was going there for it wasn't the staff it wasn't the servant because she knew that if I can get the man if I can get this prophet there's a God inside this prophet and gehazi passed on before them laid the staff upon the child and there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awake and when Elisha came to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went there for and shut the door 20 upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went and he went and laid upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his eye hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child waxed warm now I began to think that he laid himself upon the child his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eye what was he doing he was breathing the breath of life into him just like God did with Adam in the Garden of Eden that same God came down and breathed the breath of life into this young boy and even us today when we are dead in sins dead in trespasses the Breath of Life comes and he breathes the breath of life into our bodies to come to life that same God that was in the garden is the same God breathing the Breath of Life into this boy and we know that then he returned and walked into the house and for walked to and fro went up and stretched himself upon and the child sneezed seven times Why seven times because the work was finished my confidence lays in nothing else in Jesus Christ that same God breathing the breath of life he does the same thing today he's breathing upon his people he's bringing life to his people you see you can only if you don't got confidence in something it can't help you or do anything for you if you don't got confidence in something we can't help you or do anything for you but yet I'm so thankful that God has proved his word that we can have a time-tested memorial that we can have a Bible that shows us who we are that reveals us that gives us confidence in his word that he says I'll be with you even in you what is he getting us to what is he getting us to what kind of confidence should we have a perfect kind of confidence acquired confidence what is this quiet confidence what is this quiet confidence it's a third pool confidence don't tell anybody it's not a public show it's a third pool you can have confidence from within not everybody's gonna know it's not for everybody but it's for an elect it's for a chosen bride it's for an elect lady that I place within her a confidence don't tell everybody it's for ones I've called ones I've chosen he's given you that confidence he's given you that assurance you say brother James kind of stuff only happens in the Bible babies being raised from the dead and only in Jesus day and he all these different things but let me remind you of that little Mexican woman with a dead baby that was in your day that little Mexican baby had confidence that the doctors declared it dead at 10 A.M that morning of pneumonia now no matter what everybody else said this Mexican lady had a desire and was persistent and had confidence that if I can get to that man just like the same faith of that shunamite woman let's read it in perseverance doctors declared it dead at 10 A.M he says if God could Open the Eyes of a blind man he also give back a baby he's still the same God tonight friend you've got to be persistent to achieve something what if she would have would have listened and said well the baby is dead and just give up and go on you ever heard that before just give up and go on you'll never overcome you'll never get over that you'll never be victorious but listen it's the same God today well the baby is dead just give up and go on and see if that same faith that lived in the woman like the shinimite woman it still lives in people today once in a while they could strike that something not a put on not a make-believe but something real something that's genuine don't you think we can do that tonight he's the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever and she had that confidence that if I can get to the prophet of this hour my circumstances will change is that quiet confidence look at all the men Believers Christian men were stopping her to get to the prophet but yet she knew if I can get to him if I can see if I can get to that man he knows Jesus there's a Jesus inside him there's a confidence that she had now brother Branham he begins to talk here in this next quote and if I can just back it up that brother Branham begins to talk and he begins to talk about our Bible and how the confidence that we should have in it and he begins to tell the story about the this little stamp that a little boy had and he took it to the convenience store me many of you know the story and he took it to the convenience store and he wanted a an ice cream and he took this stamp and he traded this stamp in for an ice cream a little later that convenient sore men sold it for five hundred dollars later that stamp was sold for 2500. when the prophet said it in this sermon he was saying that that stamp is worth quarter of a million dollars and a boy traded an ice cream for it but yet it's just a piece of paper you see this is a piece of paper with a cover but the value isn't in this but it's what's written on the piece of paper there's hundreds of thousands of thousands of Bibles in the world it's a piece of paper yes we hold value to it but if you understand what I'm saying it's what's written on it is what brings its value what's written on it is the infallible word of Jesus Christ what's written on this is your ticket out of here it's more than just a book the value is placed on what's written and many people don't understand the value why because they don't understand what's written they can't read between the lines that's why they don't have confidence in it brother Branham says here Jesus of Nazareth passes by in 58 and he says so that's the way with it is with God if he made a promise he must keep that promise if he doesn't keep that promise then he isn't God and if a certain crisis arises and God acts on that crisis then he has to act the same the second time that he's act or he's acted the wrong way the first time if someone was sick and God was consulted and God healed that person then the second time someone gets sick and God is consulted and he's got to heal the the second time or he did wrong when he acted the first time he says for God is infinite God is infinite we are finite we get smarter Our Generations get brighter and more intelligent our scientists move on but God being infinite he has to be perfect all the time he cannot get smarter he cannot lose any of his intelligence he Remains the Same there's where our confidence can solely rest can rest solely upon what he says to be the truth if it isn't then I can't believe him and if this Bible doesn't if his promises he's made in this Bible is not true then it's not the Bible or there is no God but if the Bible's promises are true and God confirms him promises then he is God of the Bible which is his word just as plain as could be do you believe that musicians come you see our confidence can rest solely upon his word and we are just talking in the back room they didn't even know but this book is full of promises it's full of promises but you have to take him at his word his word said I'll be with you even in you his word says that all things are possible to them that believe do you believe tonight you see this is a book of promises it's not a hope so it's not a maybe or possibly but God is confident and I have this confidence amen he that began the work he that begin the work it's nothing I can do within myself it's nothing that you could do [Music] but he that begin the work will finish it so what do you have to worry about tonight if your confidence lays in him what do you have to worry about it I'll ask you again what is your confidence live this evening he's the most important thing [Music] the Lord is the confidence the Lord is my confidence in quietness and confidence shall be your strength you see when you're weak you're strong you try it when you begin to place your life into his hands when you begin to surrender not my will but your will you know the hardest thing is giving up your will [Music] when you give somebody complete confidence you have no control over it but I can say that I have full confidence in Jesus Christ who has called us who has elected us let us stand [Music] let's just pray [Music] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we Lord we're so thankful Lord we're so thankful for your word and [Music] thought that you placed upon our hearts we ask that it would be an encouragement that the people would see that a quiet confidence it's not a boasting it's not an arrogant it's not a look at me or what I can do for Jesus Christ but Lord when we begin to get ourselves out of the way you can use us father you're still the same yesterday today and forever Lord you're still doing Miracles you're still raising the dead you're still moving in lives and Lord we see the great needs of amongst us in our church but father we have a confidence and assurance that you got it all in control we know that you said you would never leave us or forsake us and father we are so thankful what a blessed people we are to know who we are and what you've called us and Lord I just ask that you would just be

you give them that confidence Lord if the world can try to push being confident in who they are Lord how much more should we as the body of believers who have a promise who have an assurance Lord let us rest in the promises of your word and father I just thank you and I praise you be with your people we commit Our Lives into your hands in Jesus name amen let's sing it I have a father [Music] and
