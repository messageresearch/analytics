brother saying looking for Jesus for the love for the lovely one for the the one for the unho his sometimes we just got to go looking back friends we were Saed the to what we [Music] before God we appear his it's noer good for you to stand your mirror said brother Steve why would you say that because you're not worthless godes you as the Lamb of been a many young girl that didn't her body natural got themselves in fears and anxi that they the that tell you morning God Andes all there's a many a wife that child depression to God when we speak of SE it speaks spirital resur we areed in Christ fall into ground and you know if you have a tree that's from the orinal and if it's strong and a good there should be some seeds ins well friends that's not an original Fruit but you know if you take that and take into once again and so if you are planted in Christ Jesus then all things are so then you are planted through the death of Our Lord Jes are part of the original seed you will Romans chapter 6 are you okay with Romans chap 6 ver areed with that GL word when I'm speaking about refocusing I wanted to tell you thumb out of focus tooc to refocus for we have been planted together shall also in the likess of now we spoke just now about now Paul to the Romans chap 12 would say therefore Breen by the mer of God that you present what your bodies a living God is Not Des living sacri present your Living Sacrifice now in order to SA there needs to be and to see this now as we the altar of God the hly we see that it's not just single day our we King the in re know re he like things heed [Music] the is that right brother Holy Ghost this place what goding the heart they brought David forth begin to compose and F the like AAG re buil an I want you to notice also that you need to get to an altar before you experi not a glamorous place I want to speak not just natural but I want to bring it to your meet God in the old test structur to Tower but an alter traditionally is not it's a place where there's a lot [Music] of embarrassing bring your the altar is where you bring your broken an is where the names of your children your unsaved loved ones if you need a job this morning theing Lord this morning if you're sick and afflicted an altar is a place 5 yourself under the mighty hand of God see to take your life I'm always right you've heard that saying I often say to my wife if I join you what you think I'm just as natural as all you you know I'm just procla we got to get to a place that we're just our upon the thear the sacrif the but the problem is I'm always crawling off the altar because I you know we talked about anxiety we found many altars for our families and that would mean that he had a collap lung I think sister and you know I I spent many times take friends we get desperate to bees kind all kinds of rattlesnakes were coming in my mailbox then the church family don't you have any You Preach fa don't you have all I'm speaking this way now some of you might get that but this place is where I can humble myself gentes in the room and I felt his presence and I said I'll be okay with that friend that's the bridge is all pulled down and my life exposed when where the the there will be no more even though the devil would come and I'm expressing to you this morning speak because this is where I want to point you to some her name is Hannah Hannah was bar and she had story she felt that Sheed to have found drunk heart and she needed to reach God and in Psalms Psalms 34 Verse 17 the righteous remember I'm speaking about you this because he's clothed you in his right the righte C he doesn't turn a ear to you some for I love that nothing is too the Lord is and such you know I don't know about you friend but I want more of the Lord I got to find myself with a broken Lord I got to put this stuff that's on my minding the car it's important that I got to put it on the stand to be in your presence not just because you got a health ISS come attend church more often know friend we we got to have desire The House of the to with Jesus app heart SE I I need it Lord scripture continues to say the affli he knows your [Music] he came to know exact what you're going through he could he he know great high priest know the feeling of this morning whatever you have the brother that wrote in the pra report Shing God knew you brother while situation he I believe it with all my heart these are the few names that I know each one of some of them are so private open a word about thank you Lord this morning how we praise your name you should Psalm 141 i c make haste unto me unto my voice I C let my prayers be [Music] as this altar that we have to no good to get a place you know many times this is kind sometimes need to ever done that you're smiling real big I see you've done it you know what use is going to what use is going to doct to simple seven took a little girl come you done anything Propet that told you the theoc and look at the TV let me give you just a little story you know there the he would spend time at the about the preaching of word one of he would do this every week one of the by and this man would cry with his would say would you come and clean out of my life Lord went Theon by the name of Lord and for all why are we letting the spider keep spinning in our Liv for to steal and to kill and destroy but Jesus said I have come that they might have life in the world we all teen we've been a long ways you know the message building know the message maybe even better than I the your seniors in the word devil to spin and our well let me tell you why we allow it we allow the devil and we say this and we quote it to our children school before the fall and we know you see we have to come to the place where nothing matters and that we can say fool brother tears flowing people crying unto the Lord I don't think we always have things but sometimes we need I need to be sensitive in these areas because some people don't believe sometimes is a good to dri you know it takes a whole lot of humility it takes a lot of humility brother all of respect paragraph 180 I'll take away with the Lord's disp I going I believe the altar in our heart I believe we the caral man really shrinks at the idea of an altar man though it to the to thirst how many's ever been really
